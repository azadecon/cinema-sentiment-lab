1
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,440
<i>Poor parents.</i>

2
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,640
<i>They put in so much effort</i>
<i>in naming their kids...</i>

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,280
<i>while friends destroy them</i>
<i>with nicknames.</i>

4
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,600
<i>And those names stick forever!</i>

5
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,040
<i>Here are Mr. and Mrs. Iyer.</i>

6
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,240
<i>After four struggling years...</i>

7
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,800
<i>they still couldn't agree on a name.</i>

8
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,200
Child's name?

9
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,600
-Rishab.
-Ronnie.

10
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,680
-Rishab.
-Ronnie.

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,520
-Rishab.
-Ronnie.

12
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,160
-Rishab.
-Ronnie.

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,000
Rama Shankar.

14
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,080
<i>Nobody had the guts</i>
<i>to argue with Grandpa.</i>

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,320
<i>But little did they</i>
<i>know that Rama Shankar</i>

16
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,720
<i>was destined to be</i>
<i>a left arm fast bowler.</i>

17
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,480
<i>And we would rechristen him as...</i>

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,240
Akram!

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,360
Hey, Akram!

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,760
-Aunty, is Akram home?
-Shut up!

21
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,200
What's with you kids?
Why do you call him Akram?

22
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,000
<i>-Oops!</i>
-Don't you dare call him Akram!

23
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,800
I won't let him play with you guys.

24
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,440
He is the team's
left arm fast bowler.

25
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,800
Why can't they call him
Rudra Pratap Singh or Ashish Nehra?

26
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,200
There are so many other
good left arm bowlers.

27
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,280
I will get him to bowl with his
right hand, I don't like that name.

28
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,080
<i>His naming was an emotional affair.</i>

29
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,480
My father was very happy
when I was born.

30
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,600
So, he named me Happy Singh.

31
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,360
And when my son was born,
I was promoted.

32
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,160
-Guess what we named him!
-What?

33
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,400
Go on. It's a simple question.

34
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,760
Promotion Singh?

35
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,560
Lucky Singh!

36
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,360
<i>But whatever poor Lucky Singh said...</i>

37
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,560
<i>the opposite would come true.</i>

38
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,760
India is going to win today!

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,360
No!

40
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,040
We've lost the game!

41
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,720
Come on.

42
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
We should never watch
the match with him.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,400
<i>So we called him...</i>

44
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,280
Lucky, why does everyone
call you 'Unlucky'?

45
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,840
Maybe because I am unlucky.

46
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,400
<i>Now, Laxman was the younger kid.</i>

47
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,520
<i>Always in his brother's hand-me-downs.</i>

48
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,160
It's almost new.
We bought it last year.

49
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,960
It's time for school.
Let's leave.

50
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,920
Wow, you're back in
the second hand pants?

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,200
My bad luck is really bad!

52
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,080
<i>He'd made up his mind</i>
<i>to save for new clothes.</i>

53
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,720
<i>So we'd stop calling him Second Hand.</i>

54
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,240
<i>And here is the James Bond of movies.</i>

55
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,840
The name is Jhangyani.
Balwan Jhangyani.

56
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,360
<i>He hated wearing underwear.</i>

57
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,520
So, tell me...

58
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,040
why don't you wear an underwear?

59
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,600
Because it's in style!

60
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,840
Hrithik, Shah Rukh, Salman...
nobody wears it.

61
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,480
You should also give it a try.

62
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,200
-Cheers!
<i>-We had no option but to call him</i>

63
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,640
Janghya! Get us some water!

64
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,760
"Janghya! Get us some water!"

65
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,960
<i>His pushy parents pushed him</i>
<i>into everything.</i>

66
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,800
<i>Karate.</i>

67
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,440
<i>Skating.</i>

68
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,560
<i>Cricket.</i>

69
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,600
<i>Etcetera... etcetera...</i>

70
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,320
<i>That's why we called him,</i>
<i>the all-rounder</i>

71
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,720
Aflatoon, let's play!

72
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,280
Can't! I have tennis class!

73
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,280
<i>This kid was on mute.</i>

74
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,880
<i>So naturally, we named him...</i>

75
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,440
Hey, Silencer.
Come down!

76
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,680
<i>Indian by birth, Chinese by spirit.</i>

77
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,440
<i>His nickname... Shaolin.</i>

78
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,760
<i>And this is me.</i>
<i>The mastermind of my team.</i>

79
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,000
Ghatotkach!

80
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,800
<i>Ghatotkach is the right answer.</i>

81
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,320
<i>Even our gang had a nickname.</i>

82
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,720
Chillar Party! Shut up!

83
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,000
Creating a ruckus all day!

84
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,960
<i>We had two enemies.</i>

85
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,080
<i>The oversized neighborhood</i>
<i>cricket team.</i>

86
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,480
<i>To whom we lost all cricket matches</i>

87
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,800
Losers!
How about winning for a change!

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,240
So we can also celebrate!

89
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,600
Such losers!

90
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,120
The day we win,
I swear I'll burst a cracker in his house.

91
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,880
<i>Our other sworn enemy, Loose Motion.</i>

92
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,080
<i>Not the lady, her pommy!</i>

93
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,560
<i>She would poop all</i>
<i>over the cricket ground.</i>

94
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,920
<i>And so we hated dogs too.</i>

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,480
I wish I could wring its neck!

96
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,240
-We can't do anything to that dog.
-Why not?

97
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,280
We'd be the prime suspects!

98
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,880
If another dog lands up here
we'll end up playing hopscotch.

99
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,040
Got it?

100
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,400
He is right.

101
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,120
<i>Poo! Poo, lots of poo.</i>

102
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,120
There will never be...
another dog in our colony!

103
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,960
Unlucky! Not again!
You are not to say positive things!

104
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,160
My left eye is flickering.
Is that a bad omen?

105
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,520
<i>I am coming,</i>
<i>Listen to me carefully</i>

106
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,360
<i>I am coming,</i>
<i>Listen to me carefully</i>

107
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,080
Hey! Why are you peeping inside?

108
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,320
I'm here for an interview.

109
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,480
Hey, Uncle!

110
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,080
-Uncle!
-Hey, kiddo!

111
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,960
-Let him in.
-Let's go, Buddy.

112
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,840
Come in. Welcome.

113
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
How are you?

114
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,960
We both are awesome!
Like two peas in a pod!

115
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,560
Wait here, I'll be right back.

116
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,000
Come, Buddy.

117
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,640
<i>And our worst nightmare came true.</i>

118
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,760
There will never be
another dog in our colony!

119
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,200
Come on.

120
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,680
Him?

121
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,799
-What's your name?
-Fatka.

122
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,960
And him? Who is this?

123
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,760
This is my friend, Buddy.

124
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,600
You think he can clean all the cars?

125
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,039
-Of course, sir!
-Sure, he is a bright kid.

126
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,880
-Fix his salary before you leave.
-Yes.

127
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,320
Listen!

128
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,160
I don't want any complaints.

129
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,640
About you or your dog.

130
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,120
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

131
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,800
Work hard, kiddo!

132
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,120
There shouldn't be any complaints.

133
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,920
Greet him.

134
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,680
Mind your own business and
don't poke your nose into anything.

135
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,760
The people here are very nice.

136
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,760
Except for the secretary, who's a pain.

137
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,600
As if I'm planning to marry him.

138
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,120
But where will you stay?

139
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,640
<i>This called for an urgent</i>
<i>meeting that very evening.</i>

140
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,560
I guess the cycle
has lost three kilos.

141
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,440
But you, not a gram!

142
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,560
What's your problem?

143
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,640
What's so funny, lollypop!

144
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,360
We need all information
about our new problem.

145
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,640
Why?

146
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,840
First information...

147
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,200
then action.

148
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,040
Balwan, come home, right now!

149
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,680
Why, mummy?

150
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,240
Do you want me to come and get you?

151
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,400
With him it's action first
and then information!

152
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,960
Okay, don't forget your tasks.

153
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,680
-So, Buddy...
-No!

154
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,040
This is how they say it in Punjabi.

155
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,480
"I'll polish you from head to toe...

156
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,640
you'll be unlucky no more."

157
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,680
Gosh! He even knows my name!

158
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,400
He knows my name!

159
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,960
He talks to the cars.

160
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,120
In English, Punjabi and Japanese too.

161
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,520
Akram?

162
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,560
He takes tea on credit...

163
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,920
but buys biscuits for his dog.

164
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,320
Second Hand?

165
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,560
Both of them have blissful
afternoon snoozes.

166
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,880
And watch TV standing
outside the Electronics shop.

167
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,800
The spoilt brat doesn't
even go to school.

168
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,760
Okay guys, see you after dance class.

169
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,880
That idiot, ruined our game.

170
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,680
Silencer?

171
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,320
No use asking him.

172
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,640
He talks to his dog as well.

173
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,280
Anything else?

174
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,520
It's true!

175
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,280
Remember how
Doctor Dolittle talks to animals?

176
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,760
He does, doesn't he?

177
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,120
Janghya!

178
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,760
Your Dad has a DVD library, right?

179
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,440
So?

180
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,160
We need to do something about that!

181
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,680
"Talks to his dog!"

182
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,680
He does, I swear!

183
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,080
I swear!

184
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,080
As usual he's exaggerating!

185
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,520
Alright, Buddy.
Now give me a good night kiss.

186
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,960
I told you he talks to his dog.

187
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,880
To weaken our enemy
we need to strike on his business.

188
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,600
Why?

189
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,360
Because a weak enemy cannot blow his...

190
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,280
Guitar?

191
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,920
Drums?

192
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,320
Trumpet.

193
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,560
Oh! Trumpet!

194
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,520
Where are you taking the flour?

195
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,680
It's homework.

196
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,440
So now they're teaching
kids to cook in school!

197
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,360
Carry on.
It will be useful when you grow up!

198
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,400
Hang on.

199
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,760
Take some vegetables too.

200
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,840
It's a basic course, not advanced.

201
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,840
So what do we make with this flour?

202
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,680
Dog poop!

203
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,800
Black pepper.

204
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,360
Mold.

205
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,600
Orange poop?

206
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,320
It looks like this
when I have orange juice.

207
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,760
Idiot, add some yellow to it.

208
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,360
What is this?

209
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,920
Poop.

210
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,440
Who did this, Sir?

211
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,960
Not him, he is my business partner.

212
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,600
Buddy would never do such a thing.

213
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,640
What kind of a dog would
climb up to poop like this?

214
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,080
Wow! It looks so real!
Nice and healthy!

215
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,600
Poop is never healthy.

216
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,360
It's just nitrogenous waste.

217
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,360
What are you doing? Don't touch it.

218
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,520
It's fake.

219
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,360
-Throw it away!
-Sir, just smell it.

220
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,440
I will give you one tight slap!
Throw it away.

221
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,160
Throw it away from the car!

222
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,760
No! We forgot to add the odor.

223
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,480
You should've farted on the poop!

224
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,800
Bloody Chillar Party!

225
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,120
Hurry up!

226
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,160
Hey, you! Pass the ball.

227
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,560
Buddy, step aside.

228
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,280
A new problem everyday!

229
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,400
Why don't these kids like us?

230
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,120
Anyway why should it matter to us!

231
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,040
Where is the washcloth?

232
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,680
It was right here.

233
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,040
Buddy, have you seen our washcloth?

234
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,440
This guy is tough.

235
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,200
But no match for us.

236
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,600
-Want a bite?
-No, thanks.

237
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,080
Buddy!

238
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,880
Buddy!

239
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,440
Buddy!

240
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,720
Come out. Here's your birthday gift.

241
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,640
Buddy?

242
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,440
Buddy!

243
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,120
Buddy!

244
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,560
Buddy!

245
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,480
Buddy!

246
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,120
Buddy!

247
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,280
Buddy!

248
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,080
Buddy!

249
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,840
-What's wrong?
-Have you seen Buddy?

250
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,800
Buddy!

251
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,520
Buddy!

252
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,600
Buddy!

253
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,800
Buddy!

254
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,600
Buddy!

255
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,680
Buddy!

256
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,560
Buddy!

257
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,200
Buddy!

258
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,840
Buddy!

259
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,080
Buddy!

260
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,320
Buddy!

261
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,520
Buddy!

262
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,160
Buddy!

263
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,640
Buddy!

264
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,000
Buddy...

265
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,440
Buddy...

266
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,280
Buddy!

267
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,320
Buddy...

268
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,240
Buddy...

269
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,840
Buddy!

270
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,040
Buddy!

271
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,320
Buddy...

272
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,960
Buddy!

273
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,560
Buddy...

274
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,680
Buddy...

275
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,120
Buddy...

276
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,240
Buddy...

277
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,160
Buddy!

278
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,960
Buddy!

279
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,760
What's the matter, Arjun?

280
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,600
Mom...

281
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,680
if I'm mean to someone...

282
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,640
who has done nothing mean to me

283
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,880
then am I a bad boy?

284
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,600
Well, if you are feeling
guilty about it...

285
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,160
then you are still a good boy.

286
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,040
Finally.

287
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,880
Now his fragile body will
get some glucose and carbohydrates.

288
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,720
There goes your brain ticking again.

289
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,720
Why don't you think with your heart,
for a change?

290
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,120
Where are you going?

291
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,680
For Group Studies.

292
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,680
There's a lot of pressure!

293
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,360
Wow! You're growing up!

294
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,160
I don't think so.

295
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,560
What about tomorrow's match?

296
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,520
What about the team's captain?

297
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,160
There he is.

298
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,160
He's injured!

299
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,560
I'm sorry. I didn't do my homework.

300
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,480
Our super-fast bowler is injured!

301
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,080
While their striker Shoaib Akhtar...

302
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,120
is getting bigger
and stronger every minute!

303
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,480
He can really pack a punch!

304
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,160
In the last match, he knocked off
our five batsmen.

305
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,520
And my head too.

306
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,960
Well, we do have a back up.

307
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,280
In our colony? Who?

308
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,320
Janghya!

309
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,560
Me? Thanks, man!

310
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,200
Go get the kid with the dog.

311
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,200
Fast bowler!

312
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,760
Chillar Party wants to talk to you.

313
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,000
About what?

314
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,320
He wants to know why.

315
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,560
Don't you know?

316
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,960
We need a fast bowler!

317
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,160
We need a fast bowler!

318
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,000
So, big deal!

319
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,640
So, big deal!

320
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,360
It's for our colony's
pride and honor.

321
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,520
And he belongs to this colony.

322
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,720
What was that again?

323
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:13,240
It's for our colony's pride and
honor and you're a part of it.

324
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,120
Fine. But first you have to say sorry.

325
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,800
I want everyone to say sorry.

326
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,720
I am saying sorry on their behalf as well.

327
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,280
That's not good enough.

328
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,280
Everybody has say sorry.

329
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,240
Wonderful!

330
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,040
Chillar Party is on
their way to lose again!

331
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,520
Let's start.

332
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,200
Hold on. Where's Shoaib?

333
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,800
Let's toss?

334
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,000
Five minutes!

335
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,840
Where's Shoaib?

336
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,320
Hey! Mummy!
Go away!

337
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,560
And Fatka scores the first boundary.

338
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:29,640
<i>Don't worry</i>
<i>Give others worry!</i>

339
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,760
<i>He who messes with you</i>
<i>Give him a thrashing</i>

340
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,840
<i>Don't fry my brains</i>

341
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,600
<i>Move aside</i>
<i>Just move aside</i>

342
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,960
<i>I am coming</i>
<i>Listen to me carefully</i>

343
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:55,240
<i>I am coming</i>
<i>Listen to me carefully</i>

344
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,480
Attention everyone!

345
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,920
Though everyone played very well.

346
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,760
Only one player can
be named Man of the Match.

347
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,440
Janghya!

348
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,120
Me?

349
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,800
Get the garland.

350
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,480
Man of the match!

351
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,920
"Janghya, get the garland."

352
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,320
Janghya, come fast!

353
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,000
Buddy!

354
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,600
<i>Sometimes they fight</i>
<i>Sometimes they are stubborn</i>

355
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,160
<i>Sometimes they are</i>
<i>At each other's throat</i>

356
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,400
<i>But they became friends eventually</i>

357
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,000
<i>They are sweet</i>
<i>They are spicy</i>

358
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,760
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

359
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,440
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

360
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,080
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

361
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,920
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

362
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,640
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

363
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,800
I hate milk.
But my mom forces me to have it.

364
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,320
You're so lucky.

365
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,800
If you don't drink milk you'll
get something else to eat or drink.

366
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,600
At least you don't go
to bed on an empty stomach.

367
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,200
I get to eat on some days.

368
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,840
Or I go to bed hungry.

369
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,480
That's why I have
no complaints about milk.

370
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:46,360
<i>Like little chicks</i>
<i>They are always together</i>

371
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,840
<i>Always running here and there</i>
<i>In a group</i>

372
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,600
<i>They are different colors of Holi</i>

373
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,960
<i>They are different,</i>
<i>But they are together</i>

374
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,200
<i>When they are on your face,</i>
<i>They all look the same</i>

375
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,040
<i>One is laughing</i>
<i>Another one doesn't have a single penny</i>

376
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,480
<i>They are all different</i>
<i>It doesn't matter to them</i>

377
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:14,480
<i>They are sweet</i>
<i>They are spicy</i>

378
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,960
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

379
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,880
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

380
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,640
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

381
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,240
I envy your life.

382
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,600
You're a free bird.

383
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,520
No one sets rules for you.

384
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,480
Like our parents do.

385
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,520
Your mom cooks for you...

386
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,440
and pampers you.

387
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,400
Your father works hard all day.

388
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:52,280
So that you can get a good education.

389
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,400
When you fall ill,
your parents look after you.

390
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,560
Fine, no one sets rules for me.

391
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,000
But then, no one is there
to love me either.

392
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,480
Still envy my life?

393
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,200
<i>They are just like pretzels</i>

394
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,520
<i>They just came out of a pan</i>

395
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,880
<i>They are twisted and hot,</i>
<i>But they are sweet</i>

396
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,080
<i>They are a gist of wind</i>
<i>You can't get hold of them</i>

397
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,560
<i>They will blow</i>
<i>In the direction they wish</i>

398
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,200
<i>One gets mother's love</i>
<i>Another one faces thorns on his way</i>

399
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,840
<i>Their destinations are different,</i>
<i>But their path is same</i>

400
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,640
<i>They are sweet</i>
<i>They are spicy</i>

401
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,320
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

402
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:08,280
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

403
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,960
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

404
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:17,600
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

405
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:23,120
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

406
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,280
This colony is called Chandan Nagar.

407
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,480
So why do you all
call it Cartoon Network?

408
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,880
Because everyone here is a cartoon.

409
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,960
That's Mr. Boring!

410
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,639
He's unbearable!

411
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,320
-Hello!
-Where are you going?

412
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,120
There goes Akram!

413
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,440
I've seen you play,
show me your batting stance.

414
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,320
That's not the way you hold the bat.

415
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,760
It's not proper.

416
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,560
Your fingers should be parallel

417
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,159
and your top hand should be heavy.

418
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,840
Parallel fingers are
of utmost importance.

419
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,240
And remember, chin on your shoulder.

420
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,360
Do you want me to bowl to you?

421
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,560
Can I bowl?

422
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,040
-Are you going to spin the ball?
-No, it will be a fast ball.

423
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,080
-Fast?
-Okay?

424
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,760
Okay.

425
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:19,200
Parallel fingers, chin...
it should be like this always.

426
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,800
Don't bowl on my legs, okay?

427
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,560
Hello, how are you?

428
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,280
Okay?

429
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,920
She is the superstar of our colony.

430
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,480
Toothpaste.

431
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,160
Superstar?

432
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,080
Haven't you seen her on TV?

433
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,840
She's the one!

434
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,120
She thinks she's
a star and ignores us.

435
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,280
But I kind of like her.

436
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,840
Chillar party!

437
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,720
And who's this guy?

438
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,720
He is Googly.

439
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,040
Googly?

440
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,320
Just listen to him!

441
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,200
Hello!

442
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,400
It's surprising to
see you all together!

443
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,080
What's the occasion?

444
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,480
See you later.

445
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,000
-Bye, uncle.
-Bye.

446
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,200
How was that?

447
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,960
God has a wicked sense of humor.

448
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,760
He's made a truck and
given it the horn of a cycle.

449
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,760
His voice dwarfs his talent,
keeps him jobless.

450
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,880
<i>We learnt a lot from Fatka.</i>

451
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,280
<i>Even some things that we shouldn't have.</i>

452
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,680
What's up, old chap?

453
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,520
So you've found your way home!

454
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,880
You should have had
lunch with that punk.

455
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,960
Don't be a pain, mom!

456
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,680
I'm beat.

457
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,040
Don't mess with me.

458
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,560
Come again?

459
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,080
What's eating you up?

460
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,720
Take a chill pill.

461
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,920
"What's eating me up?"

462
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,480
"Take a chill pill?"

463
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,840
-No, mom!
-Let it go!

464
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,040
Is this what you are learning?

465
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,800
-Stop it.
-I'll teach you a lesson.

466
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,680
-Stop it.
-Shameless.

467
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,360
Don't worry, son.

468
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,200
Who will describe Mahatma Gandhi?

469
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,360
-I will. I will, madam.
-Balwan?

470
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,200
Gandhi was that dude from India

471
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,320
who had sent the
Brit losers packing.

472
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,680
Got it?

473
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,760
Don't you take interest in your child?

474
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,680
"Gandhi the dude?"

475
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,600
What if all the kids
start speaking this way?

476
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,720
Is this what you teach your kids?

477
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,640
<i>Jack and Jill went up the hill</i>

478
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,080
<i>And planned to do some kissing</i>

479
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,600
<i>Jack made a pass,</i>
<i>And grabbed her back</i>

480
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,160
<i>And now two of his front teeth are missing</i>

481
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,880
Applaud, you idiots!

482
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,600
Goodnight, son.

483
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,160
Mom that's not how you say it.

484
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,960
So how do you say it?

485
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:47,080
Eat out, slurp in, burp out, crash in!

486
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,920
Go wish your dad good night.

487
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,280
That's not how you say it, dad.

488
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,720
Eat out, slurp in, burp out, crash in!

489
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,880
If you go out to meet
Fatka, I'll thrash you.

490
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,720
Let's meet tomorrow.

491
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,080
-Please, dad.
-When?

492
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,160
Dad, just a minute.

493
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,040
Why? You are not going anywhere.

494
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,240
Stay here.

495
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,560
He has a fever, Dad.

496
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:23,560
No. In fact, you've got
the loitering fever.

497
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,680
Got it? Get inside or
you'll get a spanking.

498
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,400
Take him home.

499
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,480
It's curfew at home.

500
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,600
Same here.

501
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,200
Everyone's angry...

502
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,320
and he is too sick to clean the cars.

503
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,520
<i>Fatka could lose his job.</i>

504
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,640
Do you have an alarm clock?

505
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,680
Of course!

506
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,440
At 5:45 a.m, Mr. Rooster
comes out in his balcony.

507
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,920
We must finish by then.

508
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,560
Hey, H2O, did you see anything?

509
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,880
Yes.

510
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,800
Even we have seen things.

511
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,560
Going to the movies lately

512
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,840
with a certain Mr. Sharma's maid?

513
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,680
Do you still remember seeing this?

514
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,200
No.

515
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,000
Great, we'll forget
your movie visits too!

516
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,440
Alright. Get lost.

517
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,680
What?

518
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,840
The rooster!

519
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,640
Hurry up. Hide.

520
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,440
Who did this?

521
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,240
Catch it, catch it!
Come!

522
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,040
Come, come. One more!
Oh, no!

523
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,680
Are you guys not talking anymore?

524
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,560
Why not?

525
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,640
Their parents aren't
too happy about it.

526
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,360
What do they say?

527
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,880
They think I'm a bad kid.

528
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,800
Buddy, doesn't care.

529
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,040
He likes me for who I am.

530
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,480
I wish my interviewers
were as considerate.

531
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,200
May I say something?

532
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,960
I hope you don't mind.

533
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,560
Go ahead.

534
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,640
I was thinking about you.

535
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,120
You were?

536
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,240
Your audio and video don't match.

537
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,800
I know.

538
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:54,160
What if you only use your voice?

539
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,640
What do you mean?

540
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,480
No one knows if it's
a boy or a girl on the radio.

541
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,760
I am Manisha...

542
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,800
and you are listening to 98.3 FM,
Radio Mirchi. It's hot!

543
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,840
And here's a brand new show,
<i>Morning Masala.</i>

544
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,400
Let's begin this bright
morning with a bright number.

545
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,080
In life...

546
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,640
we often fail to understand people.

547
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,480
People didn't understand me.

548
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,320
And we...

549
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,360
failed to understand him.

550
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,600
He might come across as shabby...

551
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:47,080
but his advice got me a job.

552
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,120
Or should I say, got my voice a job.

553
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,000
D.J, hit the bass!

554
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,680
How the times have changed, Dubey.

555
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,120
Earlier, I'd be invited
for bridge inaugurations.

556
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,960
And now it's come down
to a kids' playground.

557
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,920
All thanks to the recession, sir.

558
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,680
Tie this ribbon properly.

559
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,080
-Put up the ribbon!
-It will be done.

560
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,560
-Yes.
-Come on.

561
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,640
Come on.

562
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,960
Sir, it's Tandon.

563
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,680
-Yes, Mr. Tandon.
<i>-Greetings, sir.</i>

564
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,160
Are there enough people to welcome us?

565
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,480
Or is this a waste of time?

566
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,560
-No, sir. There are enough people.
-Very good.

567
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,960
-Okay, sir. We are waiting for you.
-Yes, we'll be there soon.

568
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,800
He's got a crowd he says!

569
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,200
-Welcome, sir.
-How are you doing, Mr. Tandon?

570
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,160
-Fine, Sir. Thanks to you.
-Greetings.

571
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,280
-You didn't have to do this.
-It's my pleasure, sir.

572
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,800
This is Mr. Sharma,
in charge of maintaining the garden.

573
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,600
Very well done.

574
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,120
Come, sir.

575
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,880
He is the Treasurer of
our block, Mr. Iyer.

576
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,440
Welcome, sir.

577
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,360
Kids, move aside.

578
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,200
How nice!
Dogs are also here to welcome me!

579
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,000
Go ahead. I'll take care of this.

580
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,600
Welcome, sir.

581
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,200
Whose dog is this?
Get him out of here.

582
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,520
Why, sir?

583
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,840
-Are you arguing with me?
-No, sir!

584
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,320
Take him and get out of here.

585
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,480
You're here for a free lunch?

586
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,880
Why do you say that?

587
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,680
Applause!

588
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,720
Didn't you hear me? Just go away!

589
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,080
Uncle, stop! Don't hit him!

590
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,560
Where do you get the time, sir?

591
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,920
Don't, Buddy.

592
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,360
-What's going on?
-I don't know, sir.

593
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,160
Move away.

594
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,000
The dog attacked me, sir.

595
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,400
Take him away.

596
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,600
Fatka, get him away.

597
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,600
Fatka, get him away.

598
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,440
What happened?

599
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,080
The dog attacked me, sir.

600
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,440
Dubey...

601
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,720
Whose dog is this?

602
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,840
-Sir...
-Whose dog is this?

603
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,480
-Whose dog is this?
-Sir...

604
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,840
He's ours.

605
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,360
Sir, these children
are from my colony.

606
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,000
It was my mistake.

607
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,320
I should have crushed its neck.

608
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,840
If you'd done that...

609
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,840
we would've lost a good opportunity.

610
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,080
Do you have any issue...

611
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,360
that will get us into
the limelight again?

612
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,480
An issue?

613
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,600
Dubey...

614
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,800
politics thrives on issues,
and today we were served one.

615
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:53,360
Now watch me make a mountain
out of this molehill.

616
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,320
<i>In Mumbai, Welfare Minister</i>
<i>Mr. Shashikant Bhide...</i>

617
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,680
<i>has launched a campaign</i>
<i>against stray dogs.</i>

618
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,240
<i>He had this to say to our reporters.</i>

619
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:09,880
<i>If my secretary is not safe</i>
<i>from stray dogs...</i>

620
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,080
<i>how can the common man feel safe?</i>

621
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:20,240
<i>That's why the nuisance</i>
<i>of stray dogs must end.</i>

622
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,920
<i>For a safe Mumbai.</i>

623
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,520
But, sir, not all stray
dogs are dangerous.

624
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,120
Will you let me finish?

625
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,400
<i>We are not against all stray dogs.</i>

626
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:43,920
<i>If people feel that the stray dogs</i>
<i>living around them are not dangerous</i>

627
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:48,600
<i>then they can get them an N.O.C.</i>
<i>i.e. No Objection Certificate.</i>

628
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,520
<i>And they have a month to do this.</i>

629
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,000
<i>After a month,</i>
<i>dogs without an N.O. C</i>

630
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:02,120
<i>will have no place in the city.</i>

631
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,520
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Let's create a safer Mumbai.</i>

632
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,240
<i>These are minister Bhide's orders.</i>

633
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:13,240
<i>Dogs like Buddy, beware.</i>
<i>Try saving yourself.</i>

634
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,360
<i>Tandon, Bhide here.</i>

635
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,080
Did you watch the news?

636
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,560
Yes, sir.

637
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,760
So to make this mission a success...

638
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,040
capturing that dog is vital.

639
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,760
Yes, of course.

640
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,680
Because that dog sparked the war.

641
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,840
Don't worry, sir. I'll handle it.

642
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:43,400
<i>Buddy stood up for his friend.</i>

643
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,920
<i>So how could Buddy be wrong?</i>

644
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:53,120
Don't worry, we will get the N.O.C.

645
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,120
My dad will handle it.

646
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:08,320
My dad fears nothing, not even ghosts.

647
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:42,440
Our decision is that
this dog won't get an N.O.C.

648
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,840
And our decision is...

649
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,520
Buddy won't go from here.

650
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:30,640
<i>We decided we wouldn't let Buddy go</i>

651
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,640
<i>but we forgot that we were only kids.</i>

652
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,840
Rama Shankar.

653
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,120
Enough of this doggy nonsense!

654
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,720
Come on!

655
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:08,840
No! I won't leave Buddy!

656
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,120
Let go of me!

657
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,640
We won't let him go!

658
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,240
We won't let him go!

659
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,640
They are only kids they'll
be fine in the morning.

660
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,320
<i>Console us, make us laugh</i>
<i>Run your hand across our hair</i>

661
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,240
<i>We will become quiet</i>

662
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:40,080
<i>We are kids</i>
<i>We are a bit immature</i>

663
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,280
<i>We will become quiet</i>

664
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,480
<i>If I lack something</i>
<i>Or others lack something</i>

665
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,400
<i>I wonder why everyone thinks</i>

666
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,880
<i>Kids don't have any feelings</i>

667
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:06,920
<i>Console us, make us laugh</i>
<i>Run your hand across our hair</i>

668
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,080
<i>We will become quiet</i>

669
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,600
<i>We are kids</i>
<i>We are a bit immature</i>

670
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,840
<i>We will become quiet</i>

671
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,040
So what's an N.O.C?

672
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:54,120
Very simple. Even Janghya knows this!
Right, Janghya?

673
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,840
Just like there is MIB...

674
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,080
and LOTR, there is N.O.C.

675
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,360
What does it mean?

676
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,360
Don't you get it?

677
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,680
In MIB, M stands for Men.

678
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:20,440
In LOTR, L stands for Lord.

679
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:24,960
Similarly N.O.C. stands for...

680
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,680
No objection certificate.

681
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,960
Hey, I was getting there!

682
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,840
I've never got a
certificate for anything.

683
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,680
Why do we need a certificate?

684
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,680
It is a certificate from the society

685
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:41,760
that allows Buddy
to stay in the colony.

686
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,240
But our colony people are against it.

687
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,400
What is this?

688
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,600
It's our colony Rulebook.

689
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:09,120
It says that if more than
50 percent of the residents agree...

690
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,320
then Buddy can get an N.O.C.

691
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,120
Then even Tandon uncle
can't do anything.

692
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:27,240
There are 60 apartments in our block.
What's 50 percent of that?

693
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,520
That means we need 31 signatures.

694
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,200
So we have to go to 31 apartments?

695
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,880
Long live the Revolution!

696
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,120
Are you all with me?

697
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,120
-Long live the Revolution!
-Silence!

698
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,120
We've decided, we'll fight for Buddy.

699
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,240
And we will fight till the end.

700
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,720
If they slap us on one cheek...

701
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,040
we'll slap them on both.

702
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,520
Right?

703
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,200
He said yes.

704
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,000
So what's the strategy?

705
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,240
We have only 27 days...

706
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:37,000
to get the signatures
from our parents and neighbors.

707
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,800
If I ask my dad for a signature,
he will spank me.

708
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,520
Do you want to save Buddy?

709
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,440
-Yes or no?
-Yes.

710
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:51,760
Get kicked or slapped or shouted at.
Do whatever it takes.

711
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,560
But get the signature.

712
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,840
So, what's an N.O.C?

713
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,800
No Objection Certificate!

714
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:10,760
<i>Get kicked or slapped or shouted at.</i>
<i>Do whatever it takes.</i>

715
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,360
<i>But get the signature.</i>

716
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,080
Dad?

717
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,960
Dad...

718
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,480
What is it?

719
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,760
-I won't sign.
-Please!

720
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,640
I told you once. Now get lost!

721
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:36,520
If he wants the moon,
should I get him that too?

722
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:47,080
I don't have time for your nonsense.
Focus on your grades!

723
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,360
Hey! You won't get it!

724
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,720
Shut up!

725
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,920
You think you'll be
able to accomplish this?

726
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,880
<i>-So...</i>
<i>-Sign.</i>

727
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:33,360
I'll sign,
but to protest you must sing songs.

728
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,240
Like...

729
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:37,800
<i>-Let's revolt!</i>
<i>-Sign...</i>

730
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,000
-Very good!
-Now sign.

731
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,920
Wait, there's more.

732
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,680
<i>Revolt...</i>

733
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,840
-Can you sing in a higher pitch?
-Alright.

734
01:02:53,360 --> 01:03:00,800
<i>We'll do or die now!</i>

735
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:10,480
-You kids are doing a noble deed.
-Uncle, sign please.

736
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,360
-Where do you want me to sign?
-No signature!

737
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:17,080
You expect me to sign this nonsense?

738
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,520
Right, darling?

739
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,160
-Sorry.
-I understand.

740
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,320
I told them no a thousand times!

741
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:27,840
He's scared of his wife.

742
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,720
Just like my dad.

743
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,360
Nice muscles, bro!

744
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,680
What do you want?

745
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,280
Can you get dad's signature?

746
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,520
Did you fail again?

747
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,400
No, we want to pass Buddy's petition.

748
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,360
Alright.

749
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:22,720
Even a movie star doesn't
create such drama for an autograph.

750
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:30,800
<i>Get kicked or slapped or shouted at.</i>
<i>Do whatever it takes.</i>

751
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,240
Dad.

752
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,200
<i>But get that signature.</i>

753
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,840
-You want me to sign?
-Yes.

754
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,400
Give it to me.

755
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,600
You'll have to dance for me.

756
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,480
Start.

757
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,680
<i>Come squeeze the heart</i>

758
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:08,800
<i>Break the pot at night</i>

759
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,800
Now dance to this.

760
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:18,280
<i>My hopes are burning in my heart</i>

761
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,480
Not good enough. Get lost.

762
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,200
Get out!

763
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,840
Get lost!

764
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,320
Don't come back here.

765
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,200
What a waste!

766
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,280
Dad.

767
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:02,760
Thank you, Dad!

768
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,320
You want me to complain to your dad?

769
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,480
Get lost!

770
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,280
Didn't I say no?

771
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:15,680
No, thanks.

772
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,800
-Please?
-No!

773
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,680
But I'm not signing!

774
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,800
What?

775
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,200
You stole my banana!

776
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:35,640
What?

777
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,320
Look at me and say it!

778
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:43,920
What happened?

779
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:56,320
After so much of effort,
we have only 10 signatures.

780
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,520
It's so frustrating!

781
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,240
-Buddy?
-Buddy...

782
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,840
Why are they refusing to sign?

783
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,320
What is their problem?

784
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,960
They're afraid of the minister!

785
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:51,240
He scares them.

786
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,480
What's wrong?

787
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:02,760
What's bothering you?

788
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:07,560
I'm wondering why everyone
is afraid of the minister.

789
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,640
Because he is very powerful.

790
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,840
How?

791
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,840
He has public support!

792
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:23,600
And that makes a person powerful?

793
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,120
Yes.

794
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,200
You think even we should
approach the public?

795
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:35,520
If you truly believe
in what you're doing, then why not.

796
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:41,040
If I do this, dad will scold me!

797
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:49,160
If your actions bring about something
good, then it's all worth it.

798
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,760
This glum look doesn't suit you.

799
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,920
Are you here to mock us?

800
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,120
I'm here to help you.

801
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:34,640
How do you expect to do that?

802
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:38,279
You're also a kid and kids
are never taken seriously.

803
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,960
You think you're super smart in here

804
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,319
but in the real world?

805
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,720
What do you know about the real world?

806
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,560
I know you call me "Toothpaste."

807
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,279
Because you're on TV!

808
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:59,600
So if you want to be seen and heard

809
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,480
and match up to the Minister

810
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,680
you have to go on TV, like me!

811
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,000
How's that possible?

812
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,680
What's the big deal?

813
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:14,920
These days even a hen laying five eggs
qualifies as breaking news.

814
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,600
But what will be our breaking news?

815
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,600
Our Buddy doesn't even lay eggs.

816
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:34,960
Does he?

817
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,160
Good morning, son.

818
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,360
Mom, where is the newspaper?

819
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,080
Since when did you start
reading the newspaper?

820
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,600
Please, mom!

821
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,680
Go take it from your brother.

822
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,520
Even the newspaper is a hand-me-down!

823
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,080
<i>This news is a real eye opener!</i>

824
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,440
<i>We'll be back after the sensational</i>
<i>story of a criminal...</i>

825
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,000
<i>Another breaking news!</i>

826
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,840
<i>A beard that cures jaundice.</i>

827
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,280
Does this make any sense?

828
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,800
Let me watch!

829
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:14,400
<i>Osama Bin Laden issued</i>
<i>another warning.</i>

830
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,920
<i>And with that the</i>
<i>stock market crashed.</i>

831
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,840
<i>People sold their shares.</i>

832
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,320
<i>How will this phenomenon</i>
<i>affect our markets?</i>

833
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,800
<i>We will keep you informed.</i>

834
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,720
<i>Today's big debate,</i>
<i>what would be Osama's next step?</i>

835
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:34,560
Have you heard of Osama Bin Laden?

836
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:35,720
No.

837
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,080
Don't you watch the news?

838
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,680
Oh, God!

839
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,400
The world is doomed!

840
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,960
Have you heard of Osama Bin Laden?

841
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,440
Yeah.

842
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:51,840
You watch the news!

843
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,800
Why is everyone in Chandan Nagar
refusing to sign the petition?

844
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:05,680
Who will win the due
between the pen and the sword?

845
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:06,960
What did he say?

846
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:12,200
Who? Tell me, who?
Who is keeping apart two friends?

847
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,640
When will the wait end...

848
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:20,720
for these innocent kids?

849
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:27,040
The kid is a dog-whisperer
but nobody believes it!

850
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:41,320
-You talk to Buddy, don't you?
-Well...

851
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,720
-Don't you?
-Yeah.

852
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,320
But how do we get the
reporters to hear this?

853
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:54,280
And here is some amazing news

854
01:12:54,360 --> 01:13:00,800
<i>a dog named Buddy in</i>
<i>Chandan Nagar, talks to people!</i>

855
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,520
<i>If you can't believe this...</i>

856
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:07,800
go there and see for yourself.

857
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:14,280
Googly said that a lot
of reporters will show up.

858
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,920
They'll ask a lot of questions
but don't be scared, okay?

859
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,440
Nothing scares me.

860
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,160
You think you can handle this?

861
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,840
Don't worry.

862
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,200
I'll take care of it.

863
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,240
I think...

864
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:55,720
So, how many reporters?

865
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,400
Not even one.

866
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,920
I think nobody will show up.

867
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:16,880
Kids, there's a reporter here!

868
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,160
-Reporter?
-Reporter?

869
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,880
Hey, Unlucky,
you should have said that earlier.

870
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,560
The talking dog lives here, right?

871
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,800
Yes.

872
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:30,880
Ten copies of The Daily Sensation!

873
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,240
30 rupees.

874
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,040
Make that one.

875
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,520
Three rupees.

876
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,400
Here! Over here!

877
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:51,160
Talking dog in Chandan Nagar.

878
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:55,560
The kids of Chandan Nagar
are trying to save Buddy

879
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:58,000
from the law passed by
Minister Shashikant Bhide.

880
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,800
For this they need 31 votes

881
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,200
and have succeeded in getting 10 votes.

882
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:11,040
The article also says
that they want public support

883
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,440
to save the talking dog.

884
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,680
That will help them
gather enough votes...

885
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:22,000
to keep Buddy safe
from the minister's law.

886
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:24,040
How immature!

887
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,440
Interesting.

888
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:31,120
Sir, nobody reads this rubbish.

889
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:32,640
Dubey...

890
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:37,200
it might be a small spark.

891
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,640
But it must be doused...

892
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,080
before it becomes a wild fire.

893
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,640
Mr. Bhide has sent this for you.

894
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,440
He wants to have a word with you.

895
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,640
Hello, Tandon.

896
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,040
Chandan Nagar is getting famous.

897
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,920
I had no idea.

898
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:58,240
Of course!
You were caught sleeping!

899
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,760
<i>You didn't even realize...</i>

900
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:05,280
that the kids in your
colony have outwitted you.

901
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,160
You've been fooled!

902
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,240
Sir...

903
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,040
Be ready to read tomorrow's headline.

904
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:25,000
And it will appear
in every newspaper.

905
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:28,160
"Chandan Nagar Colony's
Secretary arrested."

906
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,800
But why, sir?

907
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:35,920
He employs children as labor.

908
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,600
And, I'm sure you know...

909
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:44,080
that child labor is a crime.

910
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,360
Sir...

911
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:50,960
So, think about it, Tandon.

912
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:56,360
You either go to prison
or you fire the kid!

913
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:06,400
Good night...

914
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:10,200
and sleep...
No, hold your pants tight.

915
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,840
Very funny.

916
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,840
Good night, hold your pants tight.

917
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,000
We got five more signatures!

918
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,240
Don't worry, we will get
the rest of the signatures

919
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,200
and Buddy won't go anywhere.

920
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,720
What's the matter, Fatka?

921
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,520
Answer the door.

922
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,120
Laxman?

923
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,560
-What are you doing here at this hour?
-What?

924
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,360
-What!
-What happened?

925
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,000
Lucky!

926
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,000
What is it?

927
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,200
Fatka got fired.

928
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:36,320
<i>Like little chicks</i>
<i>They are always together</i>

929
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:42,280
<i>Always running here and there</i>
<i>In a group</i>

930
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:46,000
<i>They are different colors of Holi</i>

931
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:49,160
<i>They are different,</i>
<i>But they are together</i>

932
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:55,080
<i>When they are on your face,</i>
<i>They all look the same</i>

933
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:58,080
<i>One is laughing</i>

934
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:01,160
<i>Another one doesn't have a single penny</i>

935
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:04,560
<i>They are all different</i>

936
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,880
<i>But it doesn't matter to them</i>

937
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:10,920
<i>They are sweet</i>

938
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:14,120
<i>They are spicy</i>

939
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:20,680
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

940
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:26,840
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

941
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:33,400
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

942
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:39,520
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

943
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:46,280
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

944
01:20:54,920 --> 01:21:00,040
It's a crime for adults
to employ children.

945
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,160
But, Dad...

946
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:05,520
Arjun, it's against the law.
There's nothing we can do.

947
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,160
Fatka is an orphan.

948
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,680
If he doesn't work,
he won't have any money.

949
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,200
He'll starve.

950
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,080
The kids are devastated.

951
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,640
There has to be a way out.

952
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,320
I'm helpless.

953
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:32,160
The minister has a personal
interest in this case.

954
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,000
-Personal interest?
-Yes.

955
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:36,920
The kids are to blame.

956
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,280
Tell me, why did they have to print

957
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:40,840
-the talking dog story?
-I know--

958
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,080
That's what led to all this!

959
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,760
The law says it's a crime for
adults to employ children.

960
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:51,880
But there's no law that says
that a kid can't employ a kid!

961
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,200
Don't clean their cars,
you can clean our bicycles.

962
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
And we will pay you
from our pocket money.

963
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,480
We won't give up so easily.

964
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:09,600
<i>They are stubborn</i>
<i>Very stubborn</i>

965
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,560
Long Live the Revolution!

966
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,200
Balwan, come home, right now!

967
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:31,520
Forget it!

968
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:33,120
Coming, Mom!

969
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:37,240
Where's Lucky?

970
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,520
He's out with his friends.

971
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,000
What about his homework?

972
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,800
He completed all of it.

973
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,360
Yes.

974
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,080
That's very sweet of you.

975
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:07,920
We'll put it on Buddy
when he gets the N.O.C.

976
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,200
We need 16 more signatures.

977
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,840
And only seven days to go.

978
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,840
We have even run out of 'Breaking News.'

979
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:19,840
But we have to do something.

980
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:25,400
Something that makes
the front page headlines!

981
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,440
With photographs.

982
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:31,240
So what do we do?
Walk around the city in our underwear?

983
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,040
Do you have the guts to pull that off?

984
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,680
-I was just kidding--
-Do you have the guts?

985
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,160
You think it'll help?

986
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:51,440
It just might.

987
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,480
Let's do it.

988
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:10,640
But half a dozen kids won't help.

989
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,320
<i>We had to go ahead</i>
<i>with the underwear march</i>

990
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:18,000
<i>but to make it huge,</i>
<i>we urgently needed some money.</i>

991
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,520
Hello, sir. Fatka here.

992
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:37,440
I used to work in your hotel.

993
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:44,280
Sir, I need some money.
I'll return it next month.

994
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:50,720
No, not for illegal work.

995
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:57,640
Okay, Sir. Bye.

996
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,520
Where did all this money come from?

997
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,120
Are you doing something
you're not supposed to?

998
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:38,120
I've been saving money
to buy new clothes.

999
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:42,200
But nothing is more
important than Buddy.

1000
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,160
Hold on! Stop!

1001
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:56,200
We need to rock it.
It's an undie parade.

1002
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,200
<i>While adults might not support us</i>

1003
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,880
<i>we were sure the kids of</i>
<i>the city will stand up for us.</i>

1004
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:09,840
They'll be in their underwear!

1005
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:15,320
What do I choose? I choose this.

1006
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,080
This?

1007
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:18,680
This!

1008
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:28,920
Don't pressurize me, man.

1009
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,120
You know I don't wear underwear.

1010
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:13,240
Jhangya's not here, is he?

1011
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,320
It's my dad's!

1012

1014
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:31,640
<i>Fight them</i>

01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:35,440

-Buddy is our dog. This is to save him...

01:35:58,120 --> 01:36:01,040
<i>The public verdict is</i>
<i>that Buddy deserves an N.O.C.</i>

1075
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:04,240
<i>With cameraman Manoj,</i>
<i>this is Aditi for Zee News.</i>

1076
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:07,400
<i>As you can see thousands</i>
<i>of kids have gathered here...</i>

1077
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:10,320
Hello? Yes.

1078
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:11,440
Tell them I'm busy.

1079
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,760
<i>Everyone's saying just one slogan.</i>

1080
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,960
It's the Chief Minister.

1081
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:16,120
<i>-Save Buddy!</i>
-Chief Minister.

1082
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,040
<i>I have only one question for you</i>

1083
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:20,680
<i>are you with them in the protest?</i>

1084
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:25,240
Yes, sir?

1085
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:42,480
How many votes have the
kids managed to get?

1086
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,200
We're short of one signature.

1087
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:05,400
And one day to go!

1088
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,280
How do we get that signature?

1089
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:11,960
Sir, congratulations!

1090
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:15,760
The dog is history,
I had a word with Tandon.

1091
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,440
There are no more signatories
to sign the petition.

1092
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:24,000
The final decision will be
taken tomorrow, anyway.

1093
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:26,760
No, Dubey.

1094
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:32,680
These kids have insulted
me on national television.

1095
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,400
It's time to avenge that insult.

1096
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,920
They like showing off their
underwear, don't they?

1097
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:45,080
The dog is gone!

1098
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:53,040
Now, I'll strip them
on national television.

1099
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:57,960
I'll make them beg for mercy.

1100
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:03,800
<i>These things can be solved amicably.</i>

1101
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:10,520
<i>The kids think I've been unfair...</i>

1102
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:15,840
<i>but they shouldn't have</i>
<i>paraded in their underwear.</i>

1103
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,760
<i>Instigating other kids is wrong.</i>

1104
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:19,640
Let them come...

1105
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,520
<i>and discuss it with me on the TV.</i>

1106
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:24,840
<i>LIVE. Heart to heart.</i>

1107
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:26,920
But why on TV?

1108
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:31,240
I want the people to know...

1109
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:37,080
that their welfare and interests
are important to me.

1110
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,080
<i>A safe Mumbai...</i>

1111
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:41,760
<i>is a happy Mumbai.</i>

1112
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:43,480
<i>Thank you!</i>

1113
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:51,880
<i>Minister Bhide has invited the children to</i>
<i>discuss their problem live on television.</i>

1114
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:53,440
<i>Now we have to see...</i>

1115
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:56,760
<i>if the kids will show up</i>
<i>to debate with Mr. Bhide.</i>

1116
01:38:57,320 --> 01:39:00,040
<i>The entire nation awaits.</i>

1117
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:02,560
<i>Moreover...</i>

1118
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:04,560
Yes?

1119
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,480
Yes, Mr. Saxena.

1120
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:18,760
-Hello.
-Hello.

1121
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:20,160
-Hello.
-Hello.

1122
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:25,160
<i>We'd like to remind you</i>
<i>that exactly a month ago...</i>

1123
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:27,040
The Minister had...

1124
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:29,600
I didn't favour the protest.

1125
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:33,840
But my son insisted and I gave in.

1126
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:35,960
The Minister is a jerk.

1127
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:38,520
He enjoys troubling the kids.

1128
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:40,760
I think the kids did great.

1129
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:43,120
The newspaper published the story.

1130
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,440
<i>The children had the undie</i>
<i>parade and it's all right.</i>

1131
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:49,640
But now it's time
to put a stop to this.

1132
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:55,840
What will they do on TV?

1133
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:00,760
The minister will rip them apart.

1134
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:02,880
-And all for a dog.
-Yes.

1135
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,560
They should just forget about this.

1136
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:06,720
I agree...

1137
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:10,560
but there's something
you haven't realised.

1138
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:14,920
This fight isn't
about the dog anymore.

1139
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:19,080
It's about the kids.

1140
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:25,800
Our kids have fought
this battle on their own.

1141
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,800
And at this hour of reckoning...

1142
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:30,680
we want them to surrender?

1143
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:32,960
So what do you expect?

1144
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:35,960
You want us to see our
kids get humiliated?

1145
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:37,280
I am not saying that!

1146
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,720
If they'll be laughed at, so be it.

1147
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:44,240
The defeat will be worth it.

1148
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:46,120
At least they won't be termed as cowards.

1149
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:57,760
I feel like thrashing the minister.

1150
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:58,960
One thing is certain.

1151
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:00,960
-The kids have been very brave.
-Yes.

1152
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,160
Mr. Saxena...

1153
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,520
I don't know about the other kids...

1154
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:10,400
but our kids will
surely put up a fight.

1155
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:13,040
Mr. Iyer...

1156
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:18,000
our kids have fought
this battle as a team.

1157
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:23,160
If they go, they go together!

1158
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:26,360
At least I want all of them to go.

1159
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:47,280
I believe they should go.

1160
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:04,240
We should let them go.

1161
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:23,720
Remember this.
Whether you win or lose out there...

1162
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:27,520
for us you'll always be victorious.

1163
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:38,560
<i>None of us slept that night.</i>

1164
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:42,040
<i>Maybe it was our</i>
<i>last night with Buddy.</i>

1165
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,760
We will go to the studio after school.

1166
01:42:58,040 --> 01:42:59,240
You can come with Googly.

1167
01:42:59,320 --> 01:43:00,400
Okay.

1168
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:04,720
It's an important day for you.

1169
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:07,600
You should wear a new shirt.

1170
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:20,040
If Buddy gets the last vote
before the dog squad arrives...

1171
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:23,360
please put this collar on him.

1172
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:15,920
-They are just kids.
-They will be fine. Don't worry.

1173
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:18,920
Don't be scared.

1174
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:26,800
Don't bite the dust this time.

1175
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:33,680
Don't spare the Minister!

1176
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:37,520
<i>Console us, make us laugh</i>
<i>Run your hand across our hair</i>

1177
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:40,280
<i>We will become quiet</i>

1178
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:44,560
<i>We are kids</i>
<i>We are a bit immature</i>

1179
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:47,520
<i>We will become quiet</i>

1180
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:51,280
<i>We fell in a moment,</i>
<i>We stood up again</i>

1181
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:55,120
<i>I wonder why everyone thinks</i>

1182
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:59,480
<i>Kids don't have any feelings</i>

1183
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,200
<i>Today is the day of the verdict.</i>

1184
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:06,840
<i>Final verdict will be passed</i>
<i>on the Buddy Vs Bhide case.</i>

1185
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:10,360
<i>Praise us to the sky and leave</i>

1186
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:13,120
<i>We will become quiet</i>

1187
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:17,280
<i>We are kids</i>
<i>We are a bit immature</i>

1188
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,760
<i>We will become quiet</i>

1189
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:24,560
<i>It all began when Buddy</i>
<i>attacked Shashikant Bhide's PA.</i>

1190
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:27,960
<i>This minor issue has now snowballed</i>
<i>into such a major fight.</i>

1191
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:30,560
<i>And today you will</i>
<i>have to take the decision</i>

1192
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:33,000
<i>whether the verdict should</i>
<i>be in favor of the kids</i>

1193
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:34,520
<i>or in favor of the minister.</i>

1194
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:38,600
<i>Just distract us a bit</i>
<i>Show us an airplane</i>

1195
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:41,760
<i>We will become quiet</i>

1196
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:45,800
<i>When we hurt ourselves,</i>
<i>Just console us</i>

1197
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:49,200
<i>We will become quiet</i>

1198
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:52,840
<i>When we run into the table,</i>
<i>Shout at the table</i>

1199
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:54,760
<i>We will become quiet</i>

1200
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:59,800
<i>We are kids</i>
<i>We are a bit immature</i>

1201
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:02,960
<i>We will become quiet</i>

1202
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:06,760
<i>We fell in a moment,</i>
<i>We stood up again</i>

1203
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:10,360
<i>I wonder why everyone thinks</i>

1204
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:17,360
<i>Kids don't have any feelings</i>

1205
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:30,160
Uncle, I think you will win today.

1206
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:50,720
<i>Give us false hopes</i>
<i>Buy us an ice-cream</i>

1207
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:54,120
<i>We will become quiet</i>

1208
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:57,960
<i>When we weep give us a hug</i>

1209
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:01,600
<i>We will become quiet</i>

1210
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:08,720
Hello and welcome to
<i>The Battle Hour.</i>

1211
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:11,280
Today's episode is one of a kind.

1212
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:15,440
On my right is Mr. Shashikant Bhide

1213
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:19,480
who began the drive to put an end
to Mumbai's stray dog nuisance.

1214
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:21,680
<i>The drive is scheduled to start today.</i>

1215
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:24,880
And on my left,
are the kids from Chandan Nagar.

1216
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:31,280
They've managed the impossible in
trying to keep their dog, Buddy safe.

1217
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:34,760
<i>So there's a lot to look</i>
<i>forward to in today's show.</i>

1218
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:47,920
Hello, kids!

1219
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:52,760
It's nice to see you dressed today.

1220
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:59,600
I was afraid you might
show up in your underwear.

1221
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:08,040
I am scared of these kids.

1222
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:11,080
Because they are the
future of our nation.

1223
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:17,360
If the future of our
nation is built on lies...

1224
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:19,800
it's a matter of grave concern.

1225
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:26,840
They lied when their
colony refused the N.O.C.

1226
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:35,640
They claimed one of them
could talk with the dog.

1227
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:40,560
And the story got published,
to humor the kids.

1228
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:43,960
Am I right?

1229
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:49,800
When that did not work,
they resorted to cheap tactics.

1230
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:55,080
They instigated the kids of
our city to parade in their underwear.

1231
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:57,480
Why?

1232
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:05,600
<i>To prove that they</i>
<i>are right and I am wrong.</i>

1233
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:09,720
Am I wrong?

1234
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:15,200
I'm trying to get rid of stray dogs.

1235
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,000
Is their colony at fault?

1236
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:22,080
The residents don't want
stray dogs in their colony.

1237
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:50,560
If dad does not get ice
cream for their children...

1238
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:52,320
he becomes a bad father.

1239
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:55,240
Doesn't he?

1240
01:49:56,560 --> 01:50:00,480
The residents opposed the dog,
hence they are bad.

1241
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:02,680
The Minister is bad!

1242
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:11,880
Do you go to school?

1243
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:14,320
Of course. you do!

1244
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:16,360
Well...

1245
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:17,840
I'd like to see...

1246
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:21,840
what you're taught in school.

1247
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:29,000
This book doesn't teach
you to lie or create a nuisance.

1248
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:31,680
<i>Where did you learn that?</i>

1249
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:34,240
Tell me.

1250
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:44,880
From your parents?

1251
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:48,400
Teachers?

1252
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:52,040
<i>Why aren't you answering?</i>

1253
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:54,280
Answer me!
Where did you learn all this?

1254
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:09,760
I don't think they
have anything to say.

1255
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:12,440
This farce is over.

1256
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:15,480
I have to get back to serious work.

1257
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:17,080
I have to worry about
the future of our country.

1258
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:18,240
Let's go.

1259
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:19,760
Good bye.

1260
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:22,760
Viewers, we have to end--

1261
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:37,000
Come again?

1262
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:39,000
It's here, in my school book.

1263
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:41,480
Page 23, paragraph four.

1264
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:08,800
<i>How about an example</i>
<i>of something right?</i>

1265
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:22,880
Buddy is our friend.

1266
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,880
We had promised Fatka
that we will save Buddy.

1267
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:54,280
Good!

1268
01:52:56,040 --> 01:53:01,320
We knew we might not win against you,
but we showed up for Buddy.

1269
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:21,840
Your thugs would've captured Buddy...

1270
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:25,120
if we hadn't helped him.

1271
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,200
Fatka, would you
like to say something?

1272
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:43,240
I used to feel bad that unlike
these kids, I would never go to school.

1273
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:47,720
And I wouldn't turn out to be good.

1274
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:52,560
But, I don't feel bad anymore.

1275
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:57,680
Because adults seem to forget
all that they were taught as kids.

1276
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:02,280
So, how does it matter
if one goes to school or not?

1277
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:22,600
The verdict of the battle between the
Minister and the kids is before you.

1278
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:27,440
We will see you next
week with a new issue to discuss.

1279
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:34,080
<i>We will ride on the small fairies</i>

1280
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:39,960
<i>We will fly in the sky today</i>

1281
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:44,840
<i>We will fly</i>

1282
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:50,600
<i>They have labeled us with many tags</i>

1283
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:54,840
<i>We will get rid of them all today</i>

1284
01:56:54,920 --> 01:57:01,360
<i>We will fly</i>

1285
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:30,720
<i>Let us look at the world</i>

1286
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:35,360
<i>Through our own eyes</i>

1287
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:41,520
<i>Let us learn something</i>

1288
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:43,680
<i>On our own</i>

1289
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:49,680
<i>At a place where we wish</i>

1290
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:53,440
<i>Somewhere far away</i>

1291
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:59,200
<i>From your world</i>

1292
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:03,320
<i>We want to build a school</i>

1293
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:07,320
<i>Where we can teach you things</i>

1294
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:15,600
<i>We want to remind you</i>
<i>What you have forgotten</i>

1295
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:19,320
<i>We want to build a school</i>

1296
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:34,480
<i>There's a line on our little palms</i>

1297
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:38,720
<i>We look after it with utmost care</i>

1298
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:42,200
Buddy! Buddy!

1299
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:46,920
Buddy! Buddy!

1300
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:51,120
<i>Whoever we meet</i>
<i>We meet with a smile</i>

1301
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:55,160
<i>Leaving the enmities behind</i>

1302
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:59,080
<i>We will fly</i>

1303
01:58:59,400 --> 01:59:02,200
<i>We will fly</i>

1304
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:06,960
<i>Look</i>

1305
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:13,200
<i>From our perspective once</i>

1306
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:19,360
<i>Learn something from us</i>
<i>Once in a while</i>

1307
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:25,560
<i>At a place where we wish</i>

1308
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:31,000
<i>Somewhere far away</i>

1309
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:36,920
<i>From your world</i>

1310
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:40,720
<i>We want to build a school</i>

1311
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:44,480
<i>Where we can teach you things</i>
