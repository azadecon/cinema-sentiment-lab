1
00:02:41,274 --> 00:02:43,234
And our next delegate

2
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:47,363
...is someone who has done path-breaking
work in aerospace engineering:...

3
00:02:47,655 --> 00:02:50,116
...Mr Fugga Kumar from India!

4
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:04,172
You heard that right.
From India.

5
00:03:05,506 --> 00:03:07,217
A third-world nation.

6
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:09,344
A developing nation...

7
00:03:09,886 --> 00:03:11,096
The source of cheap labour.

8
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:14,933
Where all those tiresome
call centre workers live.

9
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:19,312
The 1-800 number tribe. The ones who
say, 'Hello ma'am, how may I help you?

10
00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:25,610
Only think about this: who
is the worldwide head of Pepsico?

11
00:03:27,195 --> 00:03:28,363
Who runs Unilever?

12
00:03:28,446 --> 00:03:30,490
Adobe?
MasterCard?

13
00:03:31,074 --> 00:03:32,367
Vodafone?
Deutsche Bank?

14
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:35,871
If you don't know maybe
you could Google it?

15
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,664
And when you're at it,
you might want to check who runs Google.

16
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:40,416
He's also an Indian.

17
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:47,715
Columbus set out to find
India and discovered America.

18
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:49,926
After all, every seventh human
being on the planet is an Indian.

19
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:52,345
Someone would have known.

20
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,140
So we all agree that
Indians invented the zero.

21
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:59,269
Shortly after that
we forgot how to count.

22
00:04:01,562 --> 00:04:03,564
You must forgive me
for speaking in Hindi.

23
00:04:05,108 --> 00:04:06,317
You'll have to adjust a little.

24
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,195
I've done that all my
life: adjusted to English.

25
00:04:10,071 --> 00:04:11,823
Not that I have anything
against English.

26
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:13,324
It's a great language.

27
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:18,496
But to our kind,
it was a huge wall.

28
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:22,375
English stood between
us and the wealthy.

29
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:26,337
It's an important asset, this language,
an asset more valuable than money.

30
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:33,845
My name is Fugga Kumar;
Fugga means 'balloon'.

31
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,808
My father used to sell
balloons on the street.

32
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,477
He's sitting with us today
my father ...

33
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:46,524
...and my mother!

34
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:50,430
Once he sold balloons
on the road and now he's

35
00:04:50,455 --> 00:04:52,930
sitting with all of you
influential people...

36
00:04:56,826 --> 00:05:00,705
And all this because of one
man who changed our lives!

37
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:04,584
This is his story.

38
00:05:11,257 --> 00:05:16,304
This year's Ramunajan Debate Prize goes
to Anand Kumar.

39
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:26,647
- Well done!
- You've made us proud of you.

40
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:33,238
And now the Education Minister....

41
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:35,115
- What did they give you?
- ..will say a few words....

42
00:05:35,198 --> 00:05:36,824
- A foreign journal.
- ...in honour of the...

43
00:05:36,891 --> 00:05:39,451
...great mathematician Ramanujan.

44
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:42,455
The second prize is a foreign journal?

45
00:05:44,582 --> 00:05:45,959
Hooray!

46
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,294
Hooray!

47
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:54,259
For poor people, life is road to heaven.

48
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:56,970
Education is road to hell.

49
00:05:59,222 --> 00:06:01,891
You mean 'road to heaven'.

50
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,144
Say, 'education is the road to heaven'.

51
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:06,229
I know that.
I was joking.

52
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,689
Do you like my joke, children?

53
00:06:08,814 --> 00:06:09,941
YES!

54
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:11,276
Then it was a good joke.

55
00:06:13,861 --> 00:06:15,989
Slow-slow increase love.

56
00:06:17,282 --> 00:06:19,450
Slow-slow increase love.

57
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:21,161
Watch it cross borders!

58
00:06:22,203 --> 00:06:26,207
Meaning: Love grows slowly and...

59
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:27,625
...then breaks all barriers.

60
00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:34,632
So as I was saying,
Education is the road to heaven.

61
00:06:35,258 --> 00:06:38,803
Study like America, study like England.

62
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,181
Both like to make computer.

63
00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:47,187
Like China, like Japan... Japan like
China and both like to invent things.

64
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:48,646
But...

65
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:52,900
India is not like America,
not like China.

66
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:56,862
India no making computer no inventions.

67
00:06:57,488 --> 00:06:58,948
India makes...

68
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:05,246
...people, Human calculators!

69
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,292
- What name was that?
- Lallan?

70
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:11,544
- Not yours, his.
- Anand Kumar.

71
00:07:13,296 --> 00:07:14,297
Look...

72
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:15,673
Anand Kumar...

73
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:21,179
He is the calculator of Patna,
Bihar, India.

74
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:34,317
So friends, if you need any help,
come to my house.

75
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:37,112
My house is open 24/7.

76
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,656
I give you the keys to my house.

77
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:43,409
Young Anand, I invite you too.

78
00:07:43,951 --> 00:07:45,411
You need any help...

79
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:48,664
...emotional, social, economical.

80
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:49,707
Come to my house...

81
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:55,213
...24-hour open because
India is not international.

82
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:58,383
You want India to scrape skies?

83
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:03,346
Long live Ram Singhji!

84
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:06,015
Long live Ram Singhji!

85
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:58,401
Future plans?

86
00:08:59,235 --> 00:09:01,654
Further studies...

87
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:06,701
... Cambridge, Oxford, PhD in math.

88
00:09:07,743 --> 00:09:09,036
Ishwar wants that too.

89
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:10,746
Ishwar? God?

90
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:13,291
My father.

91
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:16,669
You call your father by his first name?

92
00:09:17,002 --> 00:09:20,465
He's my father and I call
him that out of love.

93
00:09:22,091 --> 00:09:25,345
Really! But all this is
going to take eight or ten years.

94
00:09:25,553 --> 00:09:26,429
True.

95
00:09:26,471 --> 00:09:28,431
I'll lose all my beauty by then.

96
00:09:28,556 --> 00:09:30,433
What beauty?

97
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,767
Oh really?

98
00:09:31,851 --> 00:09:35,020
Some people say I look like
a Bollywood star at some angles.

99
00:09:37,773 --> 00:09:39,900
So do I look at you
only from those angles?

100
00:09:41,444 --> 00:09:42,903
You don't think I look beautiful?

101
00:09:43,154 --> 00:09:46,741
Facts are facts.

102
00:09:48,243 --> 00:09:50,495
Your face lacks the
golden proportion: phi.

103
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,915
- I use ghee every night.
- Not ghee, phi.

104
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,627
The number value for beauty.
Beauty has a value: 1.618.

105
00:09:58,294 --> 00:09:59,504
Beauty has a number?

106
00:09:59,795 --> 00:10:01,714
You didn't get it?
Let me explain.

107
00:10:06,469 --> 00:10:07,803
It's called the golden ratio.

108
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:10,723
- Look...
- That's my photograph!

109
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:13,809
Could you focus a little?

110
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:21,776
The ratio of this section
to this one should be 1.618.

111
00:10:22,777 --> 00:10:24,820
Whatever is beautiful in nature...

112
00:10:25,488 --> 00:10:31,786
...a flower, a butterfly, a conch,
a shell, all of them reveal this ratio.

113
00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:33,496
Isn't that fantastic?

114
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:35,581
Now look at your face.

115
00:10:36,165 --> 00:10:37,082
The ratio is 1.2.

116
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:39,752
No phi.

117
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:42,672
I'm a ratio?

118
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:44,632
I'm not saying it,
the numbers are showing it.

119
00:10:44,715 --> 00:10:46,050
I'll make your ears ring.

120
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:46,676
What's wrong?

121
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,469
I hope your math warms you at night.

122
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:49,220
I'm off.

123
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:50,263
Don't go.

124
00:10:50,346 --> 00:10:51,472
Stay a while.

125
00:10:52,723 --> 00:10:54,141
- Stay a while.
- I'm off.

126
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:54,975
Stay a while.

127
00:10:56,352 --> 00:11:01,691
Okay, tell me,
do you love mathematics more or me?

128
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:07,405
That's what I want to talk about.
Sit down for a moment.

129
00:11:12,117 --> 00:11:13,244
Will you say it today?

130
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:15,455
Here you are.

131
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:19,792
I've put my feelings down in a letter.

132
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,210
Read it.

133
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:23,504
- Okay, I'm off.
- Where are you going?

134
00:11:23,588 --> 00:11:24,755
I'm late already.

135
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,092
- The new math journals will be in at BHU.
- Say 'bye' before you leave!

136
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:40,229
These are 'feelings'? This is just...

137
00:12:11,636 --> 00:12:15,598
Hey, you, what's your name.

138
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:17,266
Anand.

139
00:12:17,808 --> 00:12:18,893
Your full name?

140
00:12:21,729 --> 00:12:23,063
You don't look like one of our students.

141
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,026
Outside students are not allowed.

142
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,486
Get out.

143
00:12:29,445 --> 00:12:29,862
Out!

144
00:12:29,945 --> 00:12:32,615
I'm only solving a problem.
Give me five minutes.

145
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:36,201
That's a foreign journal.
It has a very high standard.

146
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:38,245
I know it's foreign.

147
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:43,042
That's why I come every
week from Patna to read it.

148
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:44,877
Just a few minutes...

149
00:12:45,085 --> 00:12:46,921
Don't bother from now on.
Get out.

150
00:12:47,296 --> 00:12:49,424
Let me finish the problem.

151
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:53,344
As if you're going to solve it. Out!

152
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,514
Everyone has a right to education, sir.

153
00:12:56,597 --> 00:12:58,391
None of your lip.

154
00:12:59,892 --> 00:13:01,602
You dare argue with me?

155
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:03,396
Get out.

156
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:05,648
Are you going to lecture me?

157
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:06,899
Take this and put it back.

158
00:13:07,483 --> 00:13:08,401
Get along with you.

159
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:11,278
I've asked his full
name three or four times.

160
00:13:11,654 --> 00:13:12,697
Not a word out of him!

161
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:14,949
Get him out of here.

162
00:13:15,115 --> 00:13:17,452
Throw him out.

163
00:13:18,953 --> 00:13:20,371
- Never mind.
- Try to get a hold of yourself.

164
00:13:20,455 --> 00:13:22,247
Deep breathing might help.

165
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:24,959
You might feel better.

166
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,251
Out!

167
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:28,379
You want to read these journals?

168
00:13:28,713 --> 00:13:29,880
There is a way.

169
00:13:30,255 --> 00:13:32,257
Get an article published in one.

170
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:34,677
They give you a lifetime subscription.

171
00:13:35,094 --> 00:13:36,053
Got it?

172
00:15:19,574 --> 00:15:20,825
Give me your wallet.

173
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:22,743
Solved the equation?

174
00:15:34,088 --> 00:15:35,548
Will you take it all?

175
00:15:46,183 --> 00:15:49,478
Mahesh Babu, what's this?
Not had lunch yet?

176
00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:54,859
Now tell me quickly,
how many stamps for 55 grams to London?

177
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:55,693
London?

178
00:15:56,652 --> 00:15:57,695
Who's posting to London?

179
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,823
See for yourself who's writing.

180
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,077
Hello, son!

181
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,286
What's this letter?

182
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:08,706
What's in it?

183
00:16:09,498 --> 00:16:11,667
It's a paper I wrote
for a foreign journal.

184
00:16:12,126 --> 00:16:14,712
It's a problem in math
no one has ever solved.

185
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:16,130
And I did it!

186
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:21,385
So the white man couldn't
do it and you have?

187
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:25,014
Now let's try and encourage the lad.

188
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:27,850
He's hardly going to write
to them that he failed to do it, is he?

189
00:16:29,852 --> 00:16:31,145
It will cost 220 rupees.

190
00:16:33,397 --> 00:16:35,775
I have fifty and another five.

191
00:16:37,192 --> 00:16:38,443
Listen up, folks.

192
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:40,863
Mr Janardhan?

193
00:16:41,155 --> 00:16:42,740
You too, sir.

194
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:44,617
I need contributions.

195
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:47,036
Now give me a good stamp.

196
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:50,205
If this gets printed,
Bihar will be famous.

197
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:53,125
Nothing of the kind.

198
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:58,505
This is how the west
takes our best talent.

199
00:16:58,714 --> 00:17:03,886
They stole all of this
from our religious texts.

200
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:06,806
And how did they steal
from our religious texts?

201
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:07,723
How?

202
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:13,604
Because we didn't understand that
if you spread knowledge, it doubles.

203
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:16,481
But if you try to control it,
it loses all value.

204
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:19,359
Here's fifty and five.

205
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,655
The rest will be your contributions.

206
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:23,322
Here you go.

207
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:26,533
Spreading knowledge does
nothing for anyone, my friend.

208
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:29,620
Only the king's son becomes the prince.

209
00:17:29,912 --> 00:17:32,790
That's feudal poppycock.

210
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,292
Times have changed.

211
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:41,173
Now only he who is fit
to rule will mount the throne.

212
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:44,051
I'll be back.

213
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:45,177
There's work to do.

214
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,846
At least, have your lunch.

215
00:17:47,221 --> 00:17:48,180
Mom sent food.

216
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:50,599
When I get back.

217
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:52,059
Ishwar.

218
00:17:52,142 --> 00:17:57,064
I have to tell Kaveri
her pension money has come.

219
00:18:02,945 --> 00:18:04,822
- Hello, Uncle.
- How are you?

220
00:18:05,197 --> 00:18:06,156
Hello, Uncle.

221
00:18:06,323 --> 00:18:07,324
Stay blessed, child.

222
00:18:07,616 --> 00:18:10,953
Your son will go far away to study.

223
00:18:13,622 --> 00:18:16,000
All your worries are over.

224
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,210
Your son has got a job.

225
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:20,545
He's sent sweets for you.

226
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:22,882
Found yourself a girl?

227
00:18:28,512 --> 00:18:31,849
They say you shouldn't
hold your urges back too long.

228
00:18:42,526 --> 00:18:49,867
When we're close to each other
My heart feels all right.

229
00:18:50,284 --> 00:18:57,666
When we're close to each other
My heart feels all right.

230
00:18:58,042 --> 00:19:05,007
The books don't hold my attention
You fill up my sight.

231
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:12,765
Meeting you beats mathematics hollow

232
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:16,018
In these mistakes, I wallow.

233
00:19:17,602 --> 00:19:19,939
I ask no pardon.

234
00:19:21,565 --> 00:19:28,030
Your love has changed
the tectonics of my heart.

235
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:31,658
I wallow in my mistakes.

236
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,913
I ask no pardon.

237
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:44,213
Your love has changed
the tectonics of my heart.

238
00:19:53,638 --> 00:19:54,639
Here you go.

239
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,062
Why are you smiling?

240
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,357
What? Me smiling?
I'm not smiling.

241
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:05,067
No?

242
00:20:05,317 --> 00:20:06,401
I'm not smiling.

243
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:11,281
Eat then.

244
00:20:13,075 --> 00:20:13,993
Anand

245
00:20:14,076 --> 00:20:16,328
- What?
- She's called you.

246
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:17,621
Hello?!

247
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:21,416
Hop on to my cycle,

248
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,085
I promise you the delights

249
00:20:23,168 --> 00:20:26,338
Of several Saturday nights.

250
00:20:27,047 --> 00:20:29,216
Trusting only to God above

251
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:31,093
And to the power of our love

252
00:20:31,301 --> 00:20:34,721
We'll forget about Monday.

253
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:41,854
To leave my home to see you

254
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:44,815
You don't care a bit.

255
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:46,691
I look for you

256
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:50,279
What anyone thinks of it

257
00:20:51,155 --> 00:20:57,244
But what does love mean to you?
How do I tell you

258
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:05,836
In the darkness of my life,
you're the only bright spot.

259
00:21:06,795 --> 00:21:09,339
I wallow in my mistakes.

260
00:21:10,465 --> 00:21:13,135
I ask no pardon.

261
00:21:14,511 --> 00:21:21,268
Your love has changed
the tectonics of my heart.

262
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,355
Brother, forget it.

263
00:21:42,372 --> 00:21:43,457
Jayanti Devi!

264
00:21:43,707 --> 00:21:44,374
What is it?

265
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:47,461
I think your face has phi in it.

266
00:21:48,378 --> 00:21:50,339
Phi? What does that mean?

267
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:55,844
Your face sure has it.

268
00:22:09,191 --> 00:22:13,946
Who's getting the good news
this time, Rajendarbabu?

269
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:31,463
Did you win the lottery?
You're walking on air!

270
00:22:34,508 --> 00:22:38,178
Jayanti, my dear.

271
00:22:38,262 --> 00:22:40,180
- What is it?
- Come here.

272
00:22:40,264 --> 00:22:41,140
What is it?

273
00:22:41,223 --> 00:22:42,307
Where are you?

274
00:22:42,391 --> 00:22:45,269
You'll wake the dead.
Here I am.

275
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:47,854
I'm here, standing in the sun.
Stay where I can see you.

276
00:22:48,105 --> 00:22:50,232
Come along, move it.

277
00:22:50,274 --> 00:22:52,484
- Coming.
- What's taking you so long?

278
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:54,278
Do you want the world to hear you?

279
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:57,489
Good God!
Whatever next! Have you run mad?

280
00:22:57,572 --> 00:22:59,074
Had a peg or two?
Have a care.

281
00:22:59,158 --> 00:23:00,075
The children are around.

282
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,243
Where are the children?

283
00:23:01,785 --> 00:23:03,537
And how did they come into the world.

284
00:23:03,787 --> 00:23:05,580
- We brought them into being, right?
- Shut your face!

285
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,707
What's for lunch?

286
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,585
- What's cooking?
- Let me go. I'll tell you.

287
00:23:10,877 --> 00:23:11,461
Pumpkin

288
00:23:11,545 --> 00:23:14,548
Pumpkin, schmumpkin.

289
00:23:15,257 --> 00:23:20,887
Make us a feast,
baked bread with real butter.

290
00:23:22,222 --> 00:23:23,140
Ask me why?

291
00:23:23,223 --> 00:23:23,848
Okay, why?

292
00:23:23,974 --> 00:23:25,517
Did we get that gas connection?

293
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:30,397
You got admission to Cambridge.

294
00:23:33,317 --> 00:23:34,234
- Truly?
- How?

295
00:23:34,276 --> 00:23:35,485
Aah!

296
00:23:35,735 --> 00:23:40,282
Anand's article impressed Professor

297
00:23:40,365 --> 00:23:44,536
Richard so much he got you admission
and has invited you there himself.

298
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:46,746
- Where are you off to?
- Wow!

299
00:23:46,871 --> 00:23:48,373
I have to tell everyone the good news.

300
00:23:48,457 --> 00:23:51,960
And Jyotiprasad's loan has been passed.

301
00:24:27,287 --> 00:24:28,997
You once asked for my full name?

302
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:33,918
Here it is.

303
00:24:55,524 --> 00:24:57,817
Cut this to fit Anand.

304
00:24:58,235 --> 00:24:59,278
You know...

305
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:04,366
...in London it's so cold that your pee
turns to ice before it hits the ground.

306
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:06,368
What rubbish you talk!

307
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:08,245
This coat has holes in it.

308
00:25:08,495 --> 00:25:12,707
Patch it with my shawl.

309
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:14,626
What are you doing?

310
00:25:15,085 --> 00:25:16,795
You'll feel cold.

311
00:25:17,003 --> 00:25:18,588
Nonsense. I don't feel the cold.

312
00:25:19,214 --> 00:25:20,299
I'm too hot.

313
00:25:30,517 --> 00:25:31,726
Wah!

314
00:25:32,394 --> 00:25:34,396
You have to stop laughing
if you want me to take a picture,

315
00:25:34,438 --> 00:25:36,398
Sorry, sorry, I won't laugh.

316
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,400
I promise not to smile.

317
00:25:38,442 --> 00:25:40,110
One...two...three!

318
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:49,328
This is the first
passport in the family.

319
00:26:14,894 --> 00:26:18,690
Come in, come in...This is Anand.

320
00:26:19,191 --> 00:26:20,400
Namaste.

321
00:26:21,235 --> 00:26:24,404
Oh this is the Cambridge
don in the making?

322
00:26:24,446 --> 00:26:25,489
He is.

323
00:26:25,572 --> 00:26:28,867
Very good, very good.

324
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:31,703
- Proud of you and all that.
- Thank you, sir.

325
00:26:32,912 --> 00:26:34,664
After All...

326
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:41,129
...people from your society
don't really get that far, do they?

327
00:26:45,592 --> 00:26:47,177
You've got admission, right?

328
00:26:48,262 --> 00:26:52,015
But will you manage to get there?

329
00:26:52,641 --> 00:26:53,850
England isn't next door, you know.

330
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,522
My father paid half by taking
a loan against his provident fund.

331
00:26:58,605 --> 00:26:59,314
Really?

332
00:26:59,564 --> 00:27:04,778
And the Education Minister
said he would help.

333
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:06,196
He'll cover the rest.

334
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:07,656
- The Education Minister?
- Yes.

335
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:09,658
The money?

336
00:27:10,575 --> 00:27:13,495
Anyway...all the best!

337
00:27:13,578 --> 00:27:14,704
Thank you.

338
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:19,668
Don't mention it.

339
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:25,680
Hold my hand.

340
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:27,932
Hurry it up.
We shouldn't miss the boat.

341
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:31,436
Come along, come on.

342
00:27:51,205 --> 00:27:52,498
You haven't bathed?

343
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,418
Really?

344
00:27:56,126 --> 00:27:57,420
The shampoo is over?

345
00:27:57,962 --> 00:27:59,422
Never mind, never mind.

346
00:27:59,505 --> 00:28:01,257
But you can go into the kitchen,
can't you?

347
00:28:01,507 --> 00:28:02,800
I've not eaten a thing since morning.

348
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:05,386
Just betel leaf?
My stomach is growling.

349
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,431
Send me a glass of aloe vera juice,
will you?

350
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:11,267
But it won't give me gas, no?

351
00:28:11,517 --> 00:28:14,061
I'm meeting the Great Unwashed...

352
00:28:18,858 --> 00:28:19,775
Hello, sir.

353
00:28:20,985 --> 00:28:22,487
And how may I help you?

354
00:28:22,653 --> 00:28:24,154
You do remember, sir?

355
00:28:24,697 --> 00:28:27,783
You do remember, sir?
You said you would help?

356
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,829
When you came to my college?

357
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,082
I did invite you, yes, indeed.

358
00:28:36,459 --> 00:28:40,505
I invite anyone who has done
good work for the country.

359
00:28:41,631 --> 00:28:43,466
You did good work and so I invited you.

360
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,469
And today I proclaim...

361
00:28:47,177 --> 00:28:51,223
...that if anyone wishes
to do something for his country.

362
00:28:51,307 --> 00:28:52,642
I will invite him again and again.

363
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,810
Yes indeed.

364
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:59,064
Sir, sir, you may have forgotten...

365
00:29:00,232 --> 00:29:03,528
...but you said you
would help me with money.

366
00:29:03,903 --> 00:29:05,321
I have got admission...

367
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:07,490
Money?
Did you say money?

368
00:29:09,158 --> 00:29:10,493
Oh no, no, no-o-o...

369
00:29:11,118 --> 00:29:13,287
Do not start thinking
about money at this age.

370
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:16,457
What will become of you...?
Is this your father?

371
00:29:16,499 --> 00:29:17,458
Yes.

372
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,836
Greetings, greetings,
but you must explain this to your lad.

373
00:29:22,338 --> 00:29:23,923
Keep him away from money.

374
00:29:24,048 --> 00:29:27,301
He must not fall into
money's honeyed trap.

375
00:29:27,927 --> 00:29:31,806
He must stay away from women and money.

376
00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:34,141
At this time of his life, he must
depend only on the magic of hard work.

377
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:38,563
Did Bhagat Singh ever think of money?

378
00:29:38,729 --> 00:29:39,689
- Did he?
- No.

379
00:29:39,814 --> 00:29:40,565
No?

380
00:29:40,773 --> 00:29:42,692
I'm not explaining things clearly.

381
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:45,653
That day you blessed me...

382
00:29:45,945 --> 00:29:47,613
I have got admission abroad.

383
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,366
I want to go abroad, I need your...

384
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,410
- You're going abroad, are you?
- That's right.

385
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:53,619
Which country?

386
00:29:53,703 --> 00:29:55,538
I've got admission to Cambridge.

387
00:29:55,746 --> 00:29:56,539
- Cambridge?
- Yes.

388
00:29:56,622 --> 00:29:57,623
Very good.
You should go.

389
00:29:57,832 --> 00:29:58,916
Go to Cambridge.

390
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:01,836
Go to France. Go to Britain.
Go to America.

391
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,548
Go to UK, go to New York,
go to New Jersey, go to Bahrain...

392
00:30:05,715 --> 00:30:09,009
...go to China, go to Japan,
go to Tokyo, go to Beijing....

393
00:30:09,552 --> 00:30:11,554
Wow...I think that's a poem.

394
00:30:12,847 --> 00:30:17,560
But never forget your native land.

395
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:25,943
Never forget the land where the
Ganga flows... the land where the Buddha...

396
00:30:26,736 --> 00:30:28,696
well, His land anyway.

397
00:30:28,904 --> 00:30:30,740
Very nice. Go away.

398
00:30:31,115 --> 00:30:31,782
Go away.

399
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:33,701
Happy journey,
happy journey, you can go.

400
00:30:33,868 --> 00:30:34,702
- Happy journey,
- go.

401
00:30:34,785 --> 00:30:35,911
Who's next?

402
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:38,247
- Sir, I don't think you understand...
- Time's up.

403
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,499
One minute.

404
00:30:39,582 --> 00:30:40,750
Come along, you lot...

405
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:41,751
Hand those over...

406
00:30:41,876 --> 00:30:42,918
I'm Anand Kumar

407
00:30:43,002 --> 00:30:44,378
I told you, time's up.

408
00:30:44,462 --> 00:30:45,588
Is there a little salt in this?

409
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,172
Yes, yes.

410
00:30:47,256 --> 00:30:48,799
- I told you, time's up.
- Sir.

411
00:30:49,174 --> 00:30:50,134
I'm Anand Kumar..

412
00:30:50,217 --> 00:30:52,428
- You're done here.
- One moment

413
00:30:52,512 --> 00:30:54,263
- You've taken twenty minutes already.
- Didn't you talk to him?

414
00:30:54,346 --> 00:30:56,557
And then there are all these
people who want the minister's help.

415
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:58,809
Get up now.
The minister has other work.

416
00:30:58,893 --> 00:31:00,978
- I'm trying to...Let me tell him...
- On your feet.

417
00:31:01,353 --> 00:31:02,605
What are you doing?

418
00:31:02,688 --> 00:31:03,523
What are you doing?

419
00:31:03,606 --> 00:31:05,525
There are two hundred people
and only two hours...how will we manage?

420
00:31:05,608 --> 00:31:06,942
Make it easy on yourself.
Get up.

421
00:31:07,026 --> 00:31:08,944
Get me some room-temperature water

422
00:31:09,028 --> 00:31:10,362
What's this?

423
00:31:10,446 --> 00:31:11,739
I'll catch my death of cold.

424
00:31:11,822 --> 00:31:13,783
Sir, you promised...

425
00:31:14,825 --> 00:31:16,494
Not cold water, room temperature...

426
00:31:16,702 --> 00:31:18,954
I'll catch cold.

427
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:19,955
Move on, now.

428
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:20,956
One minute!

429
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,083
You gave me this medal,
do you remember?

430
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:25,545
Wonderful, the minister has seen it,
now will you move?

431
00:31:25,628 --> 00:31:27,087
Take this away and get
me room temperature water.

432
00:31:27,212 --> 00:31:28,380
Move along, move along.

433
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:47,316
Don't worry..

434
00:31:48,025 --> 00:31:49,652
We'll get you to England

435
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:03,123
You took out all your PF,
didn't you?

436
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:07,294
No other way we can help.

437
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:12,758
Rajendra Babu,
why struggle like this?

438
00:32:13,718 --> 00:32:16,386
Let me put in a word and
fix them up in the post office.

439
00:32:17,888 --> 00:32:19,139
I'll speak myself.

440
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:25,395
I can give you seven thousand.

441
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,859
You have to put something
up as collateral.

442
00:32:30,693 --> 00:32:32,653
Is the house in your name?

443
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,490
If you can't put the house up...

444
00:32:36,574 --> 00:32:37,950
...it's difficult.

445
00:32:41,453 --> 00:32:44,123
Is there no loan
to help educate a child?

446
00:32:44,624 --> 00:32:46,917
No such loan.

447
00:32:53,507 --> 00:32:56,468
And what do we do in the night?

448
00:32:56,552 --> 00:32:57,845
We go to sleep.

449
00:32:58,095 --> 00:32:59,096
And what do we do then?

450
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:00,681
We dream.

451
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,600
And what do we do in the day?

452
00:33:02,683 --> 00:33:04,184
We make the dreams come true.

453
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,075
Gopal, I really need my money back.

454
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:21,744
Can you arrange something?

455
00:33:22,662 --> 00:33:25,080
I wish I could.

456
00:33:25,831 --> 00:33:30,460
I spent so much on Bijlee's dowry.

457
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:56,612
Life doesn't end if you
don't go to Cambridge, does it?

458
00:33:59,448 --> 00:34:00,574
You are my son, after all.

459
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,246
Here, eat this.

460
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:13,170
- What happened?
- Dad?!

461
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:14,421
Oh God!

462
00:34:14,504 --> 00:34:15,965
- Oh God!
- Ishwar?

463
00:34:16,131 --> 00:34:17,925
Give him some water.

464
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:20,845
Ma, stay right here.

465
00:34:21,178 --> 00:34:22,596
Anand, carefully now...

466
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:24,514
Pranav, bring the cycle.

467
00:34:24,598 --> 00:34:25,557
Coming, coming.

468
00:34:25,641 --> 00:34:28,435
Wait.

469
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:36,110
Hold on.

470
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,655
Got some money?

471
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,532
Don't worry.
I have some.

472
00:34:44,618 --> 00:34:45,828
Where did they go?

473
00:34:54,837 --> 00:34:55,963
Come on, quick...

474
00:34:56,505 --> 00:34:57,840
Hold on tight.

475
00:34:57,882 --> 00:34:58,883
Take your slippers!

476
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:01,927
We won't let anything happen to him

477
00:35:04,513 --> 00:35:05,514
Where did they go?

478
00:35:11,937 --> 00:35:13,856
Try to go faster.
Pedal faster!

479
00:35:13,939 --> 00:35:15,816
We're close now,
the hospital is here.

480
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,026
Quick, quick...

481
00:35:19,862 --> 00:35:21,947
- Pranav...
- Faster, faster.

482
00:35:22,031 --> 00:35:23,490
The chain broke!

483
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:41,591
Ishwar!

484
00:35:58,734 --> 00:36:01,111
You shouldn't think
of a future with me.

485
00:36:04,698 --> 00:36:05,950
Marry someone else.

486
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,288
Forget about me.

487
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:18,921
Just because my face
lacks the golden mean?

488
00:36:21,966 --> 00:36:23,008
Right?

489
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:23,986
Poppadums, poppadums!

490
00:37:24,736 --> 00:37:26,155
Poppadums, hello, mister!

491
00:37:27,656 --> 00:37:28,949
Poppadums, poppadums! Coming ma'am.

492
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:32,077
Buy my poppadums!

493
00:37:34,246 --> 00:37:36,999
Buy my poppadums, crisp and crackly!

494
00:37:41,378 --> 00:37:42,629
Five rupees a packet...
fine spicy poppadums!

495
00:37:42,712 --> 00:37:44,131
- Five rupees
- Come towards me.

496
00:37:45,382 --> 00:37:46,341
- Poppadums?
- How much?

497
00:37:46,425 --> 00:37:48,177
- Show me
- Give them to me.

498
00:37:49,011 --> 00:37:51,013
Sir, my money?

499
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:53,640
Half a rupee less?

500
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:55,017
Will do.

501
00:38:12,034 --> 00:38:13,035
Hey Mr Poppadum Man!

502
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:13,994
Yes, ma'am?

503
00:38:14,036 --> 00:38:15,329
How much for a packet?

504
00:38:15,412 --> 00:38:16,663
Five rupees for a packet.

505
00:38:16,788 --> 00:38:17,456
Give me two.

506
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:18,707
- Two?
- Yes, please

507
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:19,749
There you go.

508
00:38:21,126 --> 00:38:22,752
Here you go,
ten rupees, please.

509
00:38:23,795 --> 00:38:25,714
Here you go.

510
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:02,417
Hello, idiot!

511
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,336
Do you have eyes or
potatoes in your head?

512
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:05,337
Can't you see such a big car?

513
00:39:06,796 --> 00:39:09,174
If you must kill yourself
Use the good offices of the Ganga.

514
00:39:15,389 --> 00:39:16,306
Anand Kumar?

515
00:39:22,771 --> 00:39:24,189
You're Anand Kumar, aren't you?

516
00:39:29,194 --> 00:39:31,113
What's this, have you bought
up the city's entire supply of papads?

517
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,115
Bought them?
I'm selling them.

518
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,118
Papads?

519
00:39:37,744 --> 00:39:39,121
But how do you know me?

520
00:39:40,664 --> 00:39:44,501
If I would not know the city's
most brilliant mind, who would?

521
00:39:46,878 --> 00:39:48,338
Perhaps you don't know me.

522
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:50,840
My name is Lallan Singh.

523
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:55,929
You won the Ramanujan Gold Medal in 1997

524
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,472
I was there.

525
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:00,934
I won it in 1987.

526
00:40:01,518 --> 00:40:02,978
I'm also a gold medallist.

527
00:40:06,898 --> 00:40:10,235
Srinivasa Ramanujam was
once my hero too.

528
00:40:12,154 --> 00:40:14,573
Then I discovered that
the real hero is elsewhere.

529
00:40:17,034 --> 00:40:18,327
Listen to me.

530
00:40:19,536 --> 00:40:21,330
Before you discover zero

531
00:40:22,497 --> 00:40:24,749
you must discover the
other nine numbers.

532
00:40:26,876 --> 00:40:29,421
Zero achieves its value only
after it joins them.

533
00:40:31,756 --> 00:40:34,259
What is this, a man like
you selling poppadums?

534
00:40:34,634 --> 00:40:36,345
You have talent.

535
00:40:36,553 --> 00:40:38,222
- Come here, you.
- Yes, sir.

536
00:40:38,388 --> 00:40:39,764
- Get over here.
- Coming.

537
00:40:39,973 --> 00:40:41,016
Come this way.

538
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:44,269
Bring the cycle along.

539
00:40:45,104 --> 00:40:46,313
Give him your cycle.

540
00:40:47,231 --> 00:40:51,276
I am a teacher,
Anand Babu, I can recognise talent.

541
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,861
Come with me.

542
00:40:53,278 --> 00:40:55,614
Take it easy.

543
00:40:57,324 --> 00:40:58,992
Sit back.

544
00:40:59,409 --> 00:41:00,410
Put the glass up.

545
00:41:00,535 --> 00:41:03,288
We shall travel in style,
with air-conditioning!

546
00:41:42,385 --> 00:41:43,886
IIT.

547
00:41:45,061 --> 00:41:47,272
Indian Institute of Technology.

548
00:41:48,564 --> 00:41:51,151
One applicant out of every
hundred thousand gets in.

549
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:56,406
The rich are willing to
pay anything to get their kids in.

550
00:41:56,822 --> 00:42:01,727
Hundreds of thousands of rupees
change hands at the coaching classes.

551
00:42:01,991 --> 00:42:06,043
In Kota, in Gujarat, it's
a business and the dividends are high.

552
00:42:06,249 --> 00:42:10,128
Politicians, businessmen, everyone wants
to put their money into this business.

553
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:15,685
All the best university professors and
college lecturers teach there and here as well.

554
00:42:16,278 --> 00:42:19,762
I've started my own coaching class in
Patna: The Excellence Coaching Centre.

555
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,516
Anandji, join me as a coach for princes,
a Dronacharya from the Mahabharata...

556
00:42:24,058 --> 00:42:27,105
...and together we will groom
a new prince, a new Arjuna each year.

557
00:42:34,026 --> 00:42:37,071
Now let me introduce you to
the numbers that give zero its meaning.

558
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:14,275
Good morning, sir.

559
00:43:14,355 --> 00:43:15,568
Good morning.

560
00:43:16,402 --> 00:43:18,028
This is Anand Kumar.

561
00:43:18,321 --> 00:43:20,852
He is a brilliant teacher
and under his guidance you,

562
00:43:21,613 --> 00:43:25,161
...my VIP students will
get a VIP entry into IIT.

563
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:27,997
Anandji, all yours.

564
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:34,545
- Think carefully.
- I've thought about it deeply, Mishraji.

565
00:43:35,129 --> 00:43:37,757
We'll make Anandji a star...

566
00:43:38,633 --> 00:43:39,675
...and we'll rake in big money.

567
00:43:39,759 --> 00:43:44,722
Anand Kumar will now
teach at Excellence Classes.

568
00:43:45,477 --> 00:43:47,600
Hey buddy, make it quick.

569
00:43:47,808 --> 00:43:49,227
We'll celebrate with sweets.

570
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:53,523
Anandji, our admission rate has doubled.

571
00:43:53,689 --> 00:43:54,607
Sit down...sit down.

572
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:56,317
Our ads have appeared in the papers.

573
00:43:56,526 --> 00:43:59,315
Here, a full page and here,
a half page.

574
00:44:00,029 --> 00:44:01,197
Look at this.

575
00:44:08,413 --> 00:44:11,582
It is time for you to
get a vehicle of your own.

576
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:14,001
This seems old and weak.

577
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,961
It looks weary too.

578
00:44:16,212 --> 00:44:18,047
Brother, look at that one.

579
00:44:19,131 --> 00:44:22,555
Money has come into the room.

580
00:44:22,635 --> 00:44:26,138
Money will dispel the gloom.

581
00:44:26,222 --> 00:44:29,642
Money will light up the dark.

582
00:44:29,725 --> 00:44:33,521
Money is a walk in the park.

583
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:37,403
Money will dispel the gloom.

584
00:44:37,483 --> 00:44:40,861
You got what you asked for.

585
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:44,114
This is all about
the illusion money spins.

586
00:44:44,198 --> 00:44:47,702
Money falls around you like rain.

587
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:49,912
Money will dispel your pain.

588
00:44:49,995 --> 00:44:53,207
Maa, Look who's here.

589
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:54,837
- Who?
- Here she is

590
00:44:54,917 --> 00:44:56,252
This is Phoolwa.

591
00:44:56,669 --> 00:45:01,757
She is going to do all the house
work...

592
00:45:02,342 --> 00:45:03,634
...and you're going to rest.

593
00:45:03,926 --> 00:45:04,802
What do you want to become?

594
00:45:04,885 --> 00:45:08,473
Computer engineering
has the highest pay so...

595
00:45:10,493 --> 00:45:12,101
That clarity will help you get there.

596
00:45:41,422 --> 00:45:46,010
You are now an authorised
signatory and this is a little gift.

597
00:45:53,934 --> 00:45:58,523
If m1 equals m2, what is
the equation of the straight line?

598
00:45:59,023 --> 00:45:59,940
Who will try?

599
00:46:00,441 --> 00:46:02,234
Y-1 = X-1

600
00:46:02,444 --> 00:46:04,487
How can anyone be so wrong?

601
00:46:06,113 --> 00:46:08,783
Got it?

602
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,166
They've come to pay but
they can't afford the fees.

603
00:46:14,246 --> 00:46:16,669
They were asking
about any scholarship...

604
00:46:16,749 --> 00:46:17,833
No such thing.

605
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:37,343
On the ground floor, your coaching class

606
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:44,193
and on the first floor, a restaurant,
a bar and a huge banquet hall.

607
00:46:44,777 --> 00:46:46,571
Patna's elite will celebrate
their weddings there.

608
00:46:47,488 --> 00:46:50,157
The land is available for a song
because it's for educational purposes.

609
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,952
Get it?
What did I tell you?

610
00:46:53,369 --> 00:46:56,789
Education is the road to heaven.

611
00:46:57,331 --> 00:46:59,917
And business is the means
to get on to that road.

612
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,589
And at this time,
education is the best business.

613
00:47:06,674 --> 00:47:14,682
If you've longed to do it, do it now.

614
00:47:16,225 --> 00:47:19,732
What do you care about others?

615
00:47:19,812 --> 00:47:28,946
The road is long
and you can't turn back.

616
00:47:31,616 --> 00:47:39,624
Those who shredded your letters unread

617
00:47:41,083 --> 00:47:48,007
Will now hang on your every word.

618
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:53,721
They'll look at you with new eyes.

619
00:47:57,057 --> 00:48:00,394
You've left your troubles behind.

620
00:48:00,603 --> 00:48:04,109
And now there's
a smile that you've learned.

621
00:48:04,189 --> 00:48:08,072
This is the illusion of money,
its power.

622
00:48:08,152 --> 00:48:10,738
Money falls around you like rain.

623
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:14,074
Money has come into the room.

624
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:17,537
Money will dispel the gloom.

625
00:48:17,662 --> 00:48:21,168
Money will light up the dark.

626
00:48:21,248 --> 00:48:24,915
Money is a walk in the park.

627
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:00,370
Reading some hot stuff?

628
00:49:01,956 --> 00:49:02,998
No sir.

629
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:05,250
Mathematics.

630
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:08,838
Odd.

631
00:49:19,264 --> 00:49:20,850
You have a yen for learning?

632
00:49:21,433 --> 00:49:23,352
Huge.

633
00:49:35,823 --> 00:49:37,324
Which class are you in?

634
00:49:37,658 --> 00:49:39,034
I had to leave school.

635
00:49:42,955 --> 00:49:45,040
Do you understand this stuff?

636
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,169
I solve it too.

637
00:50:19,909 --> 00:50:23,245
Try substituting Log X for T.

638
00:50:34,621 --> 00:50:35,257
Is it done?

639
00:50:35,337 --> 00:50:36,967
Bugger! Drop those books
and come do the dishes.

640
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:38,719
Coming in just a minute.

641
00:50:38,803 --> 00:50:40,846
They're calling you.
Come fast, you idiot!

642
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:42,807
I'm there.
In a minute.

643
00:50:43,515 --> 00:50:46,143
Just let me...thank you.

644
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:02,743
Where to? Can I drop you somewhere?

645
00:51:05,037 --> 00:51:09,083
Thank you, let's go.

646
00:51:11,418 --> 00:51:13,087
Loves studying, does he?

647
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,005
Who? Radhe Mohan?

648
00:51:16,423 --> 00:51:18,926
Sir, he's nuts.
He keeps studying on his own.

649
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:23,597
I tried to drum some sense
into him: this won't get you anywhere.

650
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:26,851
Why do you think that way?

651
00:51:27,101 --> 00:51:28,811
What's there to think, sir?

652
00:51:29,478 --> 00:51:32,326
Do you remember the tribal
boy Ekalavya in the Mahabharata?

653
00:51:32,898 --> 00:51:37,236
He was better than Arjun at archery so what
did their teacher Dronacharya ask of him?

654
00:51:38,696 --> 00:51:39,822
What?

655
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,116
He asked for his thumb to be chopped off.

656
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,076
Why?

657
00:51:44,618 --> 00:51:49,164
Just so that Prince Arjun would not
lose his position as the best archer.

658
00:51:52,417 --> 00:51:54,169
Nothing has changed.

659
00:51:54,837 --> 00:51:59,591
The sons of kings will still be kings.

660
00:52:06,632 --> 00:52:09,476
You're talking feudal poppycock!

661
00:52:10,936 --> 00:52:12,437
The world has changed now.

662
00:52:12,772 --> 00:52:14,690
The king's son won't inherit.

663
00:52:14,774 --> 00:52:16,743
He who deserves to
rule will mount the throne.

664
00:52:24,825 --> 00:52:26,410
Who will break this tradition?

665
00:52:26,881 --> 00:52:29,875
Like the Dronacharyas of the Mahabharat,
teachers today partner with kings.

666
00:52:29,955 --> 00:52:32,624
And that's how it will always be.

667
00:52:33,918 --> 00:52:34,752
Isn't it?

668
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,505
We will still demand
the thumbs of our Ekalavyas.

669
00:52:38,672 --> 00:52:40,507
And the princes will still
be considered the smartest.

670
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:44,720
Who will change things?

671
00:52:47,594 --> 00:52:48,933
By the way. what work do you do?

672
00:52:52,853 --> 00:52:54,021
I had to leave school.

673
00:52:54,688 --> 00:52:55,940
No provisions for such loans...

674
00:52:57,191 --> 00:52:58,067
No provisions for that.

675
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:00,152
Education is everyone's right.

676
00:53:04,907 --> 00:53:07,659
- Will you study, Master Puppet?
- I will study!

677
00:53:07,743 --> 00:53:09,832
- Will you go to IIT, Master Puppet?
- I will go.

678
00:53:09,912 --> 00:53:11,914
Do you have the money, Master Puppet?

679
00:53:12,873 --> 00:53:13,791
I don't.

680
00:53:13,874 --> 00:53:16,670
Then what will you become,
Master Puppet?

681
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,297
Mister Puppet.

682
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:24,164
You need sweaty wads of cash,
or your studies will be a car crash.

683
00:54:07,552 --> 00:54:09,054
What is the need to do all this?

684
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:11,974
Everything is going so well.

685
00:54:15,978 --> 00:54:16,979
For whom?

686
00:54:18,272 --> 00:54:19,982
For us.
The family is...

687
00:54:23,777 --> 00:54:27,197
We're doing well.
The family is...

688
00:54:29,574 --> 00:54:34,038
Anand Sir will coach poor kids...
Free coaching...poor kids

689
00:54:34,121 --> 00:54:37,461
Anand Sir will coach poor
kids...poor kids... Free coaching...

690
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:39,084
Hear ye, hear ye...

691
00:54:39,168 --> 00:54:42,087
Anand Sir will coach poor kids...
Free coaching...

692
00:54:42,171 --> 00:54:45,424
Admissions have started.

693
00:54:46,008 --> 00:54:48,472
Sir, sir

694
00:54:49,136 --> 00:54:50,099
What is it, Mishra?

695
00:54:50,179 --> 00:54:53,265
Anandji is opening his own centre.

696
00:54:53,765 --> 00:54:54,766
His own centre?

697
00:55:11,663 --> 00:55:13,243
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

698
00:55:21,877 --> 00:55:23,712
Must we have a hostel too?

699
00:55:25,965 --> 00:55:30,052
Feeding them, clothing them, the books,
the electricity, the water bills.

700
00:55:31,136 --> 00:55:33,097
It's perfect.

701
00:55:34,056 --> 00:55:35,390
Take it.

702
00:55:41,936 --> 00:55:43,023
Where is Anand Sir?

703
00:55:44,858 --> 00:55:46,902
We paid premium fees for his class.

704
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:49,029
Is he coming back or not?

705
00:55:52,658 --> 00:55:54,534
We don't want these
second-rate teachers.

706
00:55:54,826 --> 00:55:56,661
We will demand a refund.
You'll see.

707
00:56:00,207 --> 00:56:01,333
Keep it well.

708
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:07,839
Why did you quit your job?

709
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,300
How much can I fight my father?

710
00:56:11,093 --> 00:56:12,344
Even when Cambridge didn't work out,

711
00:56:12,427 --> 00:56:14,096
I said you had a future
with the coaching classes.

712
00:56:14,263 --> 00:56:16,932
And where are the kids for
whom you're making this sacrifice?

713
00:56:17,224 --> 00:56:18,517
Where are they?

714
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:26,108
This is good work,
I agree, but I have to pay the price.

715
00:56:27,567 --> 00:56:29,486
My father wants me
to marry an IAS officer.

716
00:56:31,947 --> 00:56:35,742
Never mind,
I'll spend my life with some stranger.

717
00:56:36,451 --> 00:56:41,831
But I warn you, your life will be ruined
just as much as you have ruined mine.

718
00:56:48,172 --> 00:56:49,589
Here's your stupid love letter.

719
00:56:51,133 --> 00:56:53,135
No one will come
to this centre of yours.

720
00:56:55,429 --> 00:56:57,722
You will drown and you will drown alone.

721
00:57:08,731 --> 00:57:11,236
Put this money away with the rest.

722
00:57:14,118 --> 00:57:15,324
There's lots to be done still.

723
00:57:15,991 --> 00:57:18,035
Master, Master.

724
00:57:19,078 --> 00:57:19,828
Master...

725
00:57:20,912 --> 00:57:23,999
Master, from tomorrow,
Suresh will not come to work.

726
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:25,167
Why not?

727
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:28,503
He's going to Patna to study,
to try and get into IIT.

728
00:57:28,587 --> 00:57:29,754
- IIT?
- Yes.

729
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:31,256
And what will he do
with a degree from IIT?

730
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,846
I want to join NASA; I want
to look for life on other planets.

731
00:57:34,926 --> 00:57:36,026
You?

732
00:57:36,106 --> 00:57:39,764
You've never seen an electric bulb,

733
00:57:39,931 --> 00:57:41,183
You've never watched TV.

734
00:57:41,266 --> 00:57:45,395
You've never seen a city and you
want to look for life on other planets?

735
00:57:45,857 --> 00:57:48,023
Get back to work quietly.

736
00:58:04,059 --> 00:58:06,552
Learn: and you conquer the world.

737
00:58:06,632 --> 00:58:09,091
But learn to know your self.

738
00:58:09,171 --> 00:58:11,526
Learn: and obstacles are defeated.

739
00:58:11,606 --> 00:58:14,024
But learn if those habits are your own.

740
00:58:14,112 --> 00:58:16,306
To learn is to crush all woes.

741
00:58:16,379 --> 00:58:20,514
Do you think you'll reach the
kind of kids you want to reach out to?

742
00:58:22,766 --> 00:58:25,435
All I know is that
there's no turning back.

743
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:29,058
Learning is your auspicious shield

744
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:31,788
Learn: for it levels the field.

745
00:58:31,868 --> 00:58:34,127
He who learns will conquer the world.

746
00:58:34,207 --> 00:58:36,665
Learn: for justice comes
flowing from learning.

747
00:58:36,745 --> 00:58:39,591
Learn: it makes you sure of who you are

748
00:58:39,671 --> 00:58:41,705
All human happiness
is tied up with learning.

749
00:58:41,785 --> 00:58:43,245
I don't want anything
less than 30 students."

750
00:58:45,707 --> 00:58:47,249
We can't pay for thirty.

751
00:58:52,754 --> 00:58:54,005
We can try.

752
00:58:59,136 --> 00:59:01,138
Raghunath Bharat reporting, sir.

753
00:59:02,264 --> 00:59:04,099
You wanted a scoop?

754
00:59:04,516 --> 00:59:07,977
In this day and age when everyone
has made education into a business...

755
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,315
...he's giving it away free?

756
00:59:12,065 --> 00:59:14,276
"I want us to write about him."

757
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:23,205
Free tuitions for the poor.

758
00:59:23,285 --> 00:59:26,424
The admissions have started.

759
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:29,412
Free tuitions for the poor.

760
00:59:29,707 --> 00:59:32,544
The admissions have started.

761
00:59:32,624 --> 00:59:33,670
Sell this as well.

762
00:59:35,377 --> 00:59:36,047
Sell it. Sell it.

763
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:38,007
What will you do at IIT?

764
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:40,093
Learn about the theory of relativity.

765
00:59:40,344 --> 00:59:41,595
What is that about?

766
00:59:42,137 --> 00:59:43,347
One way to understand it?

767
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:48,268
If you travel at the speed of light,
time starts running backwards.

768
00:59:48,352 --> 00:59:50,562
Do you have bus fare?

769
00:59:50,937 --> 00:59:51,896
No.

770
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,732
How do you plan to get there?

771
00:59:53,815 --> 00:59:57,652
The same way man got to the Moon.

772
01:00:00,614 --> 01:00:02,366
Here, here's the money.

773
01:00:02,574 --> 01:00:04,075
Study hard.

774
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:05,660
Don't worry about me at all.

775
01:00:06,786 --> 01:00:08,330
Hey, hey.

776
01:00:08,413 --> 01:00:09,956
Run, Urmila, run.

777
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:12,334
Get away from here.
Run.

778
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:11,670
May I come in, Sir?

779
01:01:13,547 --> 01:01:14,464
You may.

780
01:01:18,635 --> 01:01:21,346
Please take me in your class, Sir.

781
01:01:22,556 --> 01:01:23,765
The class is full.

782
01:01:24,516 --> 01:01:26,351
I'll sit on the side, anywhere.

783
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:28,395
I was just one mark
behind the thirtieth.

784
01:01:30,272 --> 01:01:31,315
Just one mark?

785
01:01:33,152 --> 01:01:35,109
That's a very important one mark.

786
01:01:36,945 --> 01:01:40,532
It's the difference between
a good try and a victory.

787
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:43,743
There are hundreds of thousands
who lose by just one mark.

788
01:01:45,245 --> 01:01:46,538
And until you understand
the importance of that one mark...

789
01:01:46,621 --> 01:01:48,540
...you won't stand a
chance at getting into IIT.

790
01:01:56,590 --> 01:02:01,553
So spend this year working
hard and come back next year.

791
01:02:02,554 --> 01:02:03,430
Okay?

792
01:02:05,515 --> 01:02:06,641
Go now.

793
01:02:19,946 --> 01:02:20,947
What is your name?

794
01:02:22,616 --> 01:02:23,575
Keshav.

795
01:02:24,284 --> 01:02:25,744
Kusum from Baksar.

796
01:02:25,994 --> 01:02:27,371
Suresh from Kotiya

797
01:02:27,454 --> 01:02:29,664
- What does your father do?
- He drives a rubbish truck.

798
01:02:29,748 --> 01:02:31,378
He is a labourer in a salt factory.

799
01:02:31,458 --> 01:02:32,626
He drives.

800
01:02:33,293 --> 01:02:34,336
What will you do at IIT?

801
01:02:34,416 --> 01:02:36,004
Biotech Engineering.

802
01:02:38,507 --> 01:02:39,633
Sit down.

803
01:02:40,425 --> 01:02:41,885
Nuclear Scientist.

804
01:02:45,179 --> 01:02:46,055
Sit.

805
01:02:48,224 --> 01:02:49,225
Munger, sir.

806
01:02:49,393 --> 01:02:50,477
That's quite far away.

807
01:02:50,644 --> 01:02:51,520
When did you leave home?

808
01:02:51,603 --> 01:02:52,771
Two days ago.

809
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:54,773
Have you eaten?

810
01:02:55,023 --> 01:02:56,441
I ate when I left home.

811
01:02:58,151 --> 01:02:59,694
My name is Fugga.
I'm from Baliya.

812
01:03:00,404 --> 01:03:03,064
And that's me, Fugga Kumar.

813
01:03:03,948 --> 01:03:05,241
I wanted to study so badly
that I just ran away from home

814
01:03:05,325 --> 01:03:06,993
and came to Anand Sir's class.

815
01:03:07,869 --> 01:03:08,870
How did you get to Patna?

816
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:12,791
I stole the neighbour's
hen and sold it and got here.

817
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:17,671
Sit down.

818
01:03:20,006 --> 01:03:21,716
- How are you?
- Good.

819
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:27,722
What's in the wallet?

820
01:03:28,807 --> 01:03:30,975
- Nothing.
- Why keep an empty wallet?

821
01:03:31,267 --> 01:03:32,644
For the time when I have
something to put in it.

822
01:03:35,188 --> 01:03:36,105
Sit down.

823
01:03:39,859 --> 01:03:40,985
What's your name?

824
01:03:41,152 --> 01:03:41,986
Kishore.

825
01:03:42,153 --> 01:03:43,905
What were you doing
before you came here?

826
01:03:44,113 --> 01:03:46,074
Worked in a cement factory.

827
01:03:46,491 --> 01:03:47,534
When did you study?

828
01:03:47,742 --> 01:03:50,370
Before the morning
shift and in the night.

829
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,331
And you?

830
01:03:53,707 --> 01:03:56,167
Night watchman.
And then I would study.

831
01:03:57,711 --> 01:03:58,837
How old are you?

832
01:03:59,087 --> 01:04:00,046
Eighteen.

833
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,507
You don't look eighteen.

834
01:04:02,757 --> 01:04:04,718
I eat once every two days.

835
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:06,302
Give me a chance to catch up.

836
01:04:08,054 --> 01:04:09,097
Right, sit down.

837
01:04:11,307 --> 01:04:12,350
So now, let me see...

838
01:04:12,434 --> 01:04:14,936
Does anyone know the speed of light?

839
01:04:15,269 --> 01:04:16,062
May I, sir?

840
01:04:16,145 --> 01:04:18,272
The same as the speed of darkness.

841
01:04:19,649 --> 01:04:20,650
Lallanji

842
01:04:21,943 --> 01:04:22,944
Hello

843
01:04:23,319 --> 01:04:25,489
Hello, Hello, Anandbabu.

844
01:04:25,739 --> 01:04:27,869
Did I do something to offend you?

845
01:04:27,949 --> 01:04:29,451
You didn't even call.

846
01:04:30,495 --> 01:04:32,248
Hello kids.

847
01:04:32,328 --> 01:04:35,999
I am Lallan Singh,
your teacher's friend.

848
01:04:37,459 --> 01:04:39,168
Look what I've got for you.

849
01:04:39,836 --> 01:04:40,920
Here.

850
01:04:42,296 --> 01:04:45,303
Go on, take one,
So you've started your own Institute.

851
01:04:45,383 --> 01:04:48,386
It's only an attempt.

852
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:54,100
Good, good, makes for good publicity.

853
01:04:54,392 --> 01:04:55,560
Teaching for free.

854
01:04:55,812 --> 01:04:59,481
If you had told me, I would have opened
it as Social work of Excellence Coaching.

855
01:05:03,401 --> 01:05:04,986
Now don't worry about this lot.

856
01:05:05,069 --> 01:05:07,781
I'll look after them.
You come back where you belong.

857
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:11,785
No, I'm not coming back.

858
01:05:14,579 --> 01:05:16,915
These kids need me.

859
01:05:29,969 --> 01:05:34,558
I hear your savings are over.

860
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:38,812
I'll manage.

861
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,190
Don't worry about me.

862
01:05:42,398 --> 01:05:44,275
How can I not worry about you?

863
01:05:45,527 --> 01:05:47,111
I am your well-wisher.

864
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,990
Is this your version
of a social revolution?

865
01:05:52,826 --> 01:05:55,704
This experiment is bound to fail.

866
01:05:55,787 --> 01:05:59,207
With it, you will fail and you will
take all these children down with you.

867
01:06:06,464 --> 01:06:07,716
Never mind.

868
01:06:09,509 --> 01:06:10,844
Let's do one thing.

869
01:06:11,928 --> 01:06:13,221
Return where you belong.

870
01:06:14,388 --> 01:06:15,807
I'll double your salary.

871
01:06:16,265 --> 01:06:18,017
A premium teacher should
not waste his time.

872
01:06:18,977 --> 01:06:22,606
A premium teacher should
teach premium kids.

873
01:06:23,272 --> 01:06:25,066
We'll find a good assistant
teacher to take over this class.

874
01:06:26,109 --> 01:06:27,485
Who says this?

875
01:06:28,695 --> 01:06:31,656
Where is this written?

876
01:06:32,866 --> 01:06:33,963
Raaj purano.

877
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:37,235
In that story of all stories,
the Mahabharata.

878
01:06:39,638 --> 01:06:45,211
It takes a kingmaker
to train a king.

879
01:06:51,885 --> 01:06:55,054
No one puts lame horses into the Derby.

880
01:06:56,885 --> 01:06:59,225
They stand outside the
railway station and give children

881
01:06:59,308 --> 01:07:01,227
rides for two rupees a throw.

882
01:07:04,898 --> 01:07:05,899
You see?

883
01:07:11,988 --> 01:07:13,948
Then let it be a race.

884
01:07:17,243 --> 01:07:19,126
Let me show you

885
01:07:21,678 --> 01:07:23,583
...that the lame horses
outside the station...

886
01:07:27,764 --> 01:07:29,205
...win the Derby.

887
01:07:42,226 --> 01:07:43,728
I made you.

888
01:07:45,939 --> 01:07:47,732
I will break you.

889
01:07:58,275 --> 01:07:59,869
Go home, Lallanji.

890
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:03,915
A storm threatens.

891
01:08:17,345 --> 01:08:22,225
And suppose your experiment works

892
01:08:23,893 --> 01:08:26,980
and one or two of these go to IIT?

893
01:08:28,397 --> 01:08:30,274
What will happen to the rest?

894
01:08:32,977 --> 01:08:39,076
Back to the drains and
the dung and the darkness?

895
01:08:53,979 --> 01:09:02,082
Back to the drains and
the dirt and the darkness?

896
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,060
Where are you off to?

897
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:07,853
At least eat your dinner!

898
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:27,665
Suresh,

899
01:09:31,711 --> 01:09:32,837
What are you doing?

900
01:09:42,305 --> 01:09:43,264
What's wrong?

901
01:09:45,934 --> 01:09:47,018
Are you scared?

902
01:09:55,902 --> 01:09:57,070
Scared?

903
01:10:03,388 --> 01:10:05,078
Of what are you scared?

904
01:10:09,082 --> 01:10:10,374
Of what are you scared?

905
01:10:13,211 --> 01:10:15,338
What do you have to lose?

906
01:10:16,422 --> 01:10:17,673
Anything?

907
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,509
What do you have to lose?

908
01:10:21,094 --> 01:10:22,716
What do you have?

909
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:25,014
What do you have to lose?

910
01:10:27,387 --> 01:10:28,476
Then why are you scared?

911
01:10:33,021 --> 01:10:36,484
So you'll be hungry, tired, ill.
What of that?

912
01:10:37,526 --> 01:10:38,527
What will happen?

913
01:10:40,571 --> 01:10:41,948
Will you die?

914
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:48,289
You were dead the day you
were born in a house of poverty.

915
01:10:49,042 --> 01:10:50,206
That very day.

916
01:10:58,214 --> 01:11:02,751
The rich build a beautiful
road for themselves.

917
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:09,267
They leave our roads
filled with huge potholes.

918
01:11:11,349 --> 01:11:14,105
But that's the mistake they make.

919
01:11:17,233 --> 01:11:20,004
They teach us how to
leap over those potholes.

920
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:24,985
When the time comes you'll see...

921
01:11:27,785 --> 01:11:31,247
...the highest jump,
the farthest...

922
01:11:31,915 --> 01:11:35,440
The longest jump will be ours.

923
01:11:35,701 --> 01:11:38,280
- We will jump!
- Learning is your auspicious shield

924
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,176
Learn: for it levels the field.

925
01:11:40,256 --> 01:11:41,214
We will jump!

926
01:11:41,294 --> 01:11:43,179
He who learns will conquer the world.

927
01:11:43,259 --> 01:11:46,247
- We will jump!
- Learn: for justice comes flowing from learning.

928
01:11:46,327 --> 01:11:48,649
Learn: it makes you sure of who you are

929
01:11:48,729 --> 01:11:51,715
- All human happiness is tied up with learning.
- Nuclear scientist.

930
01:11:53,311 --> 01:11:54,395
Marine architect.

931
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:56,730
You?

932
01:11:57,523 --> 01:11:58,615
NASA.

933
01:12:00,902 --> 01:12:02,195
Who will jump?

934
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:04,655
Biotech engineer.

935
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:06,199
Mechanical engineer.

936
01:12:07,328 --> 01:12:08,826
Who will jump?

937
01:12:09,702 --> 01:12:10,786
Who will?

938
01:12:11,495 --> 01:12:12,621
I will sir.

939
01:12:16,545 --> 01:12:17,543
I'll do it, sir.

940
01:12:18,336 --> 01:12:19,420
I will sir.

941
01:12:19,837 --> 01:12:20,880
I will sir.

942
01:12:20,964 --> 01:12:22,215
I will sir.

943
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:23,549
I will sir.

944
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:41,317
Learning is your auspicious shield

945
01:12:41,397 --> 01:12:44,008
Learn: for it levels the field.

946
01:12:44,088 --> 01:12:46,346
He who learns will conquer the world.

947
01:12:46,426 --> 01:12:49,037
Learn: for justice comes
flowing from learning.

948
01:12:49,117 --> 01:12:51,455
Learn: it makes you sure of who you are

949
01:12:51,535 --> 01:12:54,714
All human happiness
is tied up with learning.

950
01:12:58,314 --> 01:12:59,565
For two months now,
we've been hearing this.

951
01:12:59,649 --> 01:13:01,692
Anand Sir is coming back,
Anand Sir is coming back.

952
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,319
Give us a date.

953
01:13:03,403 --> 01:13:04,945
When is he expected?

954
01:13:05,238 --> 01:13:06,656
We gave you a million rupees.

955
01:13:07,157 --> 01:13:08,949
We gave you a million-and-
a-half for the additional guarantee.

956
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,495
I assure you, we have some first-
class teachers in Excellence Classes.

957
01:13:12,578 --> 01:13:14,247
Why are you so worried?

958
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:17,250
It was Anand's name
that brought us here.

959
01:13:18,168 --> 01:13:21,421
Now tell us straight:
When is he coming back?

960
01:13:21,695 --> 01:13:25,341
Bring him back or get
our children into his centre.

961
01:13:25,966 --> 01:13:27,260
We can't get in.

962
01:13:28,594 --> 01:13:30,263
He'll only teach poor children.

963
01:13:30,471 --> 01:13:36,060
And if our children don't get in,
you will end up poor.

964
01:13:36,602 --> 01:13:42,024
We are not the only
parents who think this way.

965
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:53,587
What are you thinking?

966
01:13:57,290 --> 01:13:59,959
I picked him up off the
road and raised him to the stars.

967
01:14:02,462 --> 01:14:04,672
I put his mug on hoardings.

968
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:08,259
And now he competes with me!

969
01:14:12,472 --> 01:14:14,557
His payments are pending, right?
Stop them.

970
01:14:15,516 --> 01:14:16,976
Let's see how tough he is.

971
01:14:19,145 --> 01:14:21,356
There Lallanji was preparing for war

972
01:14:22,273 --> 01:14:24,484
And we were preparing
for our examination.

973
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:25,610
Children, heads up!

974
01:14:27,987 --> 01:14:30,406
We're a little short of books.

975
01:14:31,031 --> 01:14:31,782
We will get more.

976
01:14:31,991 --> 01:14:33,159
Where's everybody?

977
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:34,285
Anand has come.

978
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:37,205
Go, go, he's calling you.

979
01:14:44,128 --> 01:14:46,589
Each of you shake everyone's
hand and introduce yourself.

980
01:14:48,508 --> 01:14:50,968
Make it snappy.
You only have ten seconds.

981
01:14:58,476 --> 01:14:59,352
Stop

982
01:14:59,519 --> 01:15:01,312
- Enough.
- Okay, okay.

983
01:15:01,354 --> 01:15:02,313
Was sir saying something?

984
01:15:02,355 --> 01:15:03,731
Now tell me how many
handshakes happened.

985
01:15:04,106 --> 01:15:05,316
30X30

986
01:15:05,358 --> 01:15:06,276
Sir 900.

987
01:15:07,235 --> 01:15:08,361
Wrong.

988
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,113
Sir?

989
01:15:11,197 --> 01:15:12,156
30X29.

990
01:15:12,323 --> 01:15:13,533
One doesn't shake hand with oneself.

991
01:15:14,242 --> 01:15:15,285
Wrong.

992
01:15:19,205 --> 01:15:20,373
Eight months.

993
01:15:22,124 --> 01:15:28,756
We have eight months to the examination
and we have twelve months' work to do.

994
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:31,259
How will you do it?

995
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:37,973
From now up to the examination,
you must seek the lessons in everything,

996
01:15:38,849 --> 01:15:40,601
look for the chemistry of life,

997
01:15:40,685 --> 01:15:42,812
ask what physics principles
make the fan turn,

998
01:15:44,021 --> 01:15:45,773
Ask how birds fly?

999
01:15:46,732 --> 01:15:48,776
Ask the lightning why it strikes.

1000
01:15:48,859 --> 01:15:50,320
Ask relentlessly.

1001
01:15:50,403 --> 01:15:52,154
Ask questions, get the answers.

1002
01:15:52,738 --> 01:15:54,407
Then ask questions about
the questions. Eight months.

1003
01:15:55,575 --> 01:15:57,076
This is a disease.

1004
01:16:01,539 --> 01:16:02,665
Get to the root cause of it.

1005
01:16:03,207 --> 01:16:06,168
He's just a teacher.
I'll handle him.

1006
01:16:19,139 --> 01:16:20,766
Hello, this is Anand Kumar.

1007
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:27,440
Look, you're a teacher
so I can't use foul language.

1008
01:16:27,857 --> 01:16:32,236
Please select a juicy expletive

1009
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,405
and assume I spat it at you.

1010
01:16:35,114 --> 01:16:35,906
Go on.

1011
01:16:36,407 --> 01:16:38,451
I need twenty lakhs.
Send the money.

1012
01:16:39,827 --> 01:16:41,120
I don't have it.

1013
01:16:41,371 --> 01:16:45,291
If the business doesn't make money,
close it down.

1014
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,793
If I don't shut down, what will you do?
Kill me?

1015
01:16:48,043 --> 01:16:49,504
I'll have to.

1016
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:54,258
You're ruining the market.

1017
01:16:54,384 --> 01:16:56,761
You son-of-a-gun,
how dare you threaten my brother?

1018
01:16:57,052 --> 01:16:58,471
I will come to your
house and kill you there.

1019
01:16:58,596 --> 01:17:00,473
Why are you getting
so hot and bothered about?

1020
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:03,518
- He's...
- I'm talking to him, aren't I?

1021
01:17:04,685 --> 01:17:06,312
Don't get worked up.

1022
01:17:10,691 --> 01:17:14,862
Look I'm not going to pay
and I'm not closing the class either.

1023
01:17:15,863 --> 01:17:18,157
Now do what you want.

1024
01:17:20,618 --> 01:17:23,579
And the nth term is negative 1 by 37268

1025
01:17:23,663 --> 01:17:27,917
People ask what was so special
about Anand sir's teaching style.

1026
01:17:29,251 --> 01:17:32,630
But teaching wasn't his trade;
magic was.

1027
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:34,507
He would say:

1028
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:36,342
Don't start writing right away.

1029
01:17:38,803 --> 01:17:40,388
First let a smile burst inside you.

1030
01:17:43,516 --> 01:17:45,518
Then use your head to build a formula

1031
01:17:48,938 --> 01:17:50,398
Do you see it?

1032
01:17:55,653 --> 01:17:57,780
And here he comes to the run up...

1033
01:17:58,364 --> 01:18:02,535
If Shoaib Akhtar bowls
at 143 miles per hour

1034
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:04,537
and the boundary is 63 metre away

1035
01:18:04,912 --> 01:18:08,749
how much force must
Tendulkar apply to hit a six?

1036
01:18:09,542 --> 01:18:10,543
Think.

1037
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:14,380
The chicken Fugga stole?

1038
01:18:14,464 --> 01:18:15,590
Yes, sir?

1039
01:18:15,756 --> 01:18:20,553
What if she were
to lay an egg for Fugga.

1040
01:18:22,221 --> 01:18:23,013
Do you see it?

1041
01:18:28,227 --> 01:18:29,562
No?

1042
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,734
And two for Kishore.

1043
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:37,862
And four for Kusum.

1044
01:18:38,488 --> 01:18:40,155
And eight for Aazan...

1045
01:18:40,406 --> 01:18:46,245
And so on and so on...

1046
01:18:46,328 --> 01:18:50,791
...how many eggs would Urmila get?

1047
01:18:52,126 --> 01:18:55,421
If a train is travelling
at 120 mph and one by one,

1048
01:18:55,505 --> 01:18:59,008
we knock off compartments from it,
at what speed will the engine travel?

1049
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:13,981
When a question vexes you,

1050
01:19:14,064 --> 01:19:17,652
When a question perplexes you,

1051
01:19:17,818 --> 01:19:21,280
Split hairs if you must

1052
01:19:21,531 --> 01:19:24,867
But grind it into the dust.

1053
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:28,621
Without questions,
our lives would be dark.

1054
01:19:28,829 --> 01:19:33,834
Like a bulb lighting up,
that's the question mark.

1055
01:19:35,503 --> 01:19:38,047
That's the question mark.

1056
01:19:39,089 --> 01:19:40,758
That's the question mark.

1057
01:19:42,558 --> 01:19:45,352
Clouds float above us at heights where
the temperature is minus 35 degrees.

1058
01:19:45,435 --> 01:19:46,479
Why don't clouds freeze?

1059
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:53,256
If you double the radius of this bottle,
how much milk will flow out?

1060
01:19:54,591 --> 01:19:57,844
Don't take it for granted
because it's in a book.

1061
01:19:58,019 --> 01:20:01,439
The world is waiting
for you to take a new look.

1062
01:20:01,924 --> 01:20:05,093
Life gets exciting when
you challenge the given.

1063
01:20:05,151 --> 01:20:08,905
...do the Impossible.

1064
01:20:09,238 --> 01:20:12,492
When you teach your
teachers a thing or two

1065
01:20:13,076 --> 01:20:16,329
When they say you can't
and you show them you do.

1066
01:20:16,788 --> 01:20:23,294
When you change their
'why' into a 'why not'?

1067
01:20:23,461 --> 01:20:27,256
When your brain lights
up with a lightning spark

1068
01:20:27,591 --> 01:20:32,261
And you become a living question mark.

1069
01:20:34,138 --> 01:20:36,558
That's the question mark.

1070
01:20:37,809 --> 01:20:39,561
That's the question mark.

1071
01:20:40,186 --> 01:20:43,397
Tendulkar will have to
whack it with 10,513 Newtons.

1072
01:20:43,481 --> 01:20:47,151
The speed of the engine won't change.

1073
01:20:47,193 --> 01:20:49,613
Four times as much milk.

1074
01:20:49,904 --> 01:20:53,157
53,68,70,912 eggs

1075
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:55,284
Not one of those losers should pass.

1076
01:20:56,536 --> 01:20:57,946
Spoil his name.

1077
01:20:58,162 --> 01:20:59,373
Go tell it to the newspapers.

1078
01:20:59,455 --> 01:21:00,414
File a police complaint.

1079
01:21:00,498 --> 01:21:01,499
Do what you want.

1080
01:21:01,583 --> 01:21:03,459
Close that centre down.

1081
01:21:04,168 --> 01:21:06,129
We'll cut off his electricity.

1082
01:21:06,462 --> 01:21:07,421
Go on, do it, Cut those wires.

1083
01:21:09,298 --> 01:21:11,593
The electricity has failed.

1084
01:21:13,219 --> 01:21:15,221
Anand Sir taught us to see.

1085
01:21:16,264 --> 01:21:18,767
He taught us to think.

1086
01:21:19,225 --> 01:21:21,144
We looked for solutions everywhere.

1087
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:23,980
We could do anything.

1088
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:27,441
We could become anything.

1089
01:21:28,109 --> 01:21:29,527
We could make anything.

1090
01:21:31,863 --> 01:21:32,989
We were ready.

1091
01:21:36,242 --> 01:21:39,037
But Lallan was willing
to go to any lengths...

1092
01:21:39,203 --> 01:21:40,246
Come out, you cad!

1093
01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:42,206
Yes, come out, come out.

1094
01:21:42,248 --> 01:21:43,583
Don't huddle inside.

1095
01:21:45,126 --> 01:21:47,921
This Anand Kumar ruined
the fine flower of my virtue.

1096
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,715
He said he would get me into
IIT but nothing happened.

1097
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,550
Sitting inside like a cabbage.

1098
01:21:52,967 --> 01:21:54,260
Come out.

1099
01:21:54,844 --> 01:21:55,720
What happened?

1100
01:21:57,931 --> 01:21:59,933
Brother, how can I
tell you my tale of woe?

1101
01:22:00,266 --> 01:22:02,977
This Anand has ruined me forever.

1102
01:22:03,061 --> 01:22:06,480
- Anand Kumar did these bad things to you.
- Very bad things.

1103
01:22:09,525 --> 01:22:10,652
Sister, can you tell me one thing?

1104
01:22:10,735 --> 01:22:11,903
What?

1105
01:22:11,986 --> 01:22:13,279
What does Anand look like?

1106
01:22:13,362 --> 01:22:14,322
This is Anand Kumar himself.

1107
01:22:14,405 --> 01:22:15,073
What?

1108
01:22:15,907 --> 01:22:18,117
- What?
- That's Anand Kumar, you dingbat!

1109
01:22:19,828 --> 01:22:22,622
Every stratagem needs a plan.

1110
01:22:22,872 --> 01:22:24,165
It needs revision.

1111
01:22:24,498 --> 01:22:26,584
If you don't know that,
how can you make it work?

1112
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:29,003
Next time, plan it well.

1113
01:22:29,087 --> 01:22:31,297
Work it out.
Do some revision.

1114
01:22:31,547 --> 01:22:32,757
What say?

1115
01:22:32,966 --> 01:22:34,342
Cleverclogs Tripathi

1116
01:22:34,676 --> 01:22:37,095
- Clever Clogs?
- Tripathi!

1117
01:22:37,721 --> 01:22:43,351
knows the score of every World
Cup football match before it starts.

1118
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:45,103
How does he do it?

1119
01:22:45,186 --> 01:22:46,479
Because he's clever?

1120
01:22:46,688 --> 01:22:47,939
No.

1121
01:22:48,439 --> 01:22:49,482
Because he fixes the matches?

1122
01:22:49,649 --> 01:22:53,319
Because he's a Tripathi?
The answer must be in his name.

1123
01:23:05,248 --> 01:23:06,332
My turn with the book.

1124
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:08,334
Later.

1125
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:10,336
- I need it now.
- Take it later.

1126
01:23:10,378 --> 01:23:12,463
Sir said we should share.
Come on, give it to me.

1127
01:23:12,546 --> 01:23:13,965
- I'm using it.
- Take it later.

1128
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:15,424
- Give it to me.
- I told you to wait.

1129
01:23:15,508 --> 01:23:17,343
I need it now.
- Wait!

1130
01:23:17,385 --> 01:23:19,053
Don't...

1131
01:23:19,888 --> 01:23:21,055
Now it's torn!

1132
01:23:21,347 --> 01:23:22,306
Keep it then.

1133
01:23:23,346 --> 01:23:26,874
There are two kinds
of people in the world.

1134
01:23:27,273 --> 01:23:29,275
There's Ricky

1135
01:23:30,124 --> 01:23:31,933
and there's Bholu.

1136
01:23:32,608 --> 01:23:33,693
You'll get only that one.

1137
01:23:33,777 --> 01:23:34,736
What?

1138
01:23:35,695 --> 01:23:36,612
Six hundred?

1139
01:23:38,614 --> 01:23:39,615
So expensive?

1140
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:44,617
Ricky has everything readymade,
served up on a plate.

1141
01:23:45,513 --> 01:23:51,519
Bholu has nothing,
only his wits and his willingness to work.

1142
01:23:51,544 --> 01:23:53,337
When you've decided on a goal.

1143
01:23:53,379 --> 01:23:55,048
You can get out of every hole.

1144
01:23:55,131 --> 01:23:56,590
No question will defeat you

1145
01:23:56,674 --> 01:23:58,217
No rough ride will unseat you.

1146
01:23:58,384 --> 01:24:00,178
When your brain is afire.

1147
01:24:00,261 --> 01:24:01,763
Get your basics in order

1148
01:24:01,846 --> 01:24:05,016
Get your principles right.

1149
01:24:05,224 --> 01:24:11,773
Behind every door, under every bed
Lurks a question mark.

1150
01:24:11,856 --> 01:24:13,274
Across the sky, inside my head

1151
01:24:13,441 --> 01:24:14,859
Hangs a question mark.

1152
01:24:15,151 --> 01:24:16,652
In the river running, on its cool bed

1153
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:18,863
...is a question mark.

1154
01:24:18,988 --> 01:24:21,365
We'll work, we'll wrack our brains.

1155
01:24:21,407 --> 01:24:24,202
- Sir, any chance of a second-hand copy?
- No chance.

1156
01:24:25,494 --> 01:24:28,331
It keeps me from sleeping,
that question mark.

1157
01:24:28,873 --> 01:24:31,417
We won't let it get away so easy,
that question mark.

1158
01:24:31,584 --> 01:24:36,422
You can run but you can't hide,
Question mark.

1159
01:24:38,466 --> 01:24:43,096
You can run but you can't hide,
Question mark.

1160
01:24:45,223 --> 01:24:49,102
You can run but you can't hide,
Question mark.

1161
01:24:49,185 --> 01:24:50,394
I've got you some books but...

1162
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:52,897
Next question, ten seconds only.

1163
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:01,030
Next question, ten seconds only.

1164
01:25:02,656 --> 01:25:04,700
Next question, ten seconds only.

1165
01:25:07,328 --> 01:25:09,080
Next question, ten seconds only.

1166
01:25:16,670 --> 01:25:17,713
Sir?

1167
01:25:20,091 --> 01:25:21,467
435

1168
01:25:23,845 --> 01:25:24,762
Handshakes.

1169
01:25:36,232 --> 01:25:39,527
Cleverclogs Tripathi?

1170
01:25:40,278 --> 01:25:42,446
He laid great stress on the name.

1171
01:25:42,488 --> 01:25:44,573
Listen up, I have it.

1172
01:25:44,657 --> 01:25:46,409
You're so stupid.

1173
01:25:46,492 --> 01:25:48,619
How Clever Clogs tells the score.

1174
01:25:48,702 --> 01:25:51,080
- He tells it with his mouth.
- Go on, eat.

1175
01:25:51,164 --> 01:25:52,206
A new solution.

1176
01:26:08,932 --> 01:26:09,723
Go on, eat.

1177
01:26:12,101 --> 01:26:12,643
Go on, eat.

1178
01:26:12,726 --> 01:26:17,565
Anand Sir fought like a tiger
but he lost the battle with hunger.

1179
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,485
I know you're doing great work

1180
01:26:21,986 --> 01:26:27,158
but there's no way
I can make a loan to you

1181
01:26:27,658 --> 01:26:29,493
for a free coaching scheme.

1182
01:26:29,994 --> 01:26:32,455
You know it's good work,
you say it's good work

1183
01:26:32,746 --> 01:26:34,415
but you can't support good work?

1184
01:26:35,291 --> 01:26:38,461
It should show some profit, right?

1185
01:26:38,836 --> 01:26:42,381
You don't even have any collateral

1186
01:26:43,216 --> 01:26:46,010
so how can the bank
advance you any money?

1187
01:26:46,886 --> 01:26:47,720
Just a moment...

1188
01:26:49,305 --> 01:26:50,764
Yes, sir?

1189
01:26:51,765 --> 01:26:53,767
Of course, sir...In a moment, sir...

1190
01:26:54,643 --> 01:26:55,644
But eat something, please.

1191
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:07,281
Go on.

1192
01:27:08,616 --> 01:27:09,242
Take them.

1193
01:27:16,415 --> 01:27:17,416
The children...

1194
01:27:21,754 --> 01:27:23,381
Take them for the children...

1195
01:27:34,517 --> 01:27:41,018
His helplessness took Anand Sir
to the one place he never wanted to go.

1196
01:27:46,695 --> 01:27:47,780
Anand Babu!

1197
01:27:51,151 --> 01:27:52,027
come in.

1198
01:27:55,038 --> 01:27:56,080
Come in, come in.

1199
01:27:56,705 --> 01:27:57,873
Sit down.

1200
01:28:05,506 --> 01:28:06,632
It's very hot.

1201
01:28:06,924 --> 01:28:08,342
Shall I turn on the air-conditioning?

1202
01:28:12,791 --> 01:28:15,666
How have you been?

1203
01:28:20,021 --> 01:28:21,647
That bank manager is my friend.

1204
01:28:22,856 --> 01:28:26,277
He was saying you need money.

1205
01:28:29,822 --> 01:28:32,075
You should have come to me.

1206
01:28:32,866 --> 01:28:34,618
Am I not a well-wisher?

1207
01:28:38,331 --> 01:28:39,582
Never mind.

1208
01:28:40,208 --> 01:28:42,668
Better late than never.

1209
01:28:45,846 --> 01:28:48,182
Let me feed your hungry children.

1210
01:28:48,682 --> 01:28:49,975
Take it.

1211
01:28:54,022 --> 01:28:57,191
But I know you are not
shameless enough...

1212
01:28:59,068 --> 01:29:01,404
...to take alms

1213
01:29:11,164 --> 01:29:13,749
To keep your honour intact..

1214
01:29:15,168 --> 01:29:18,212
...let me suggest a little competition.

1215
01:29:19,004 --> 01:29:20,798
Between your kids and mine.

1216
01:29:23,217 --> 01:29:26,637
If they beat my best, I'll feed them.

1217
01:29:27,638 --> 01:29:29,598
But if mine beat them,

1218
01:29:31,475 --> 01:29:32,643
Then...

1219
01:29:35,188 --> 01:29:36,647
...well then you close your centre.

1220
01:29:40,568 --> 01:29:41,819
That simple.

1221
01:29:44,238 --> 01:29:45,656
What do you say?

1222
01:29:49,077 --> 01:29:52,037
What's to think about, Anand Babu?

1223
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:55,040
If your rag-tag bunch can't
take this simple competition,

1224
01:29:55,249 --> 01:29:57,042
how are they going to face IIT?

1225
01:30:00,003 --> 01:30:01,004
Deal?

1226
01:30:06,594 --> 01:30:08,221
Three months of food?

1227
01:30:08,637 --> 01:30:09,888
Is that all you want?

1228
01:30:10,848 --> 01:30:11,849
Sure.

1229
01:30:12,057 --> 01:30:17,896
If Anand Kumar's students lose,
then Anand Kumar...

1230
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:25,738
...will close his centre and
return to Excellence Coaching Classes.

1231
01:30:31,202 --> 01:30:32,245
Why are you doing this?

1232
01:30:32,953 --> 01:30:34,330
He's sworn on his brother's head.

1233
01:30:38,417 --> 01:30:39,543
What if you really have
to shut down the centre?

1234
01:30:42,713 --> 01:30:44,257
It's going to close anyway.

1235
01:30:45,424 --> 01:30:46,842
I have no money left.

1236
01:30:51,054 --> 01:30:55,309
Right then,
if that's what you both wish.

1237
01:30:58,979 --> 01:31:01,106
Thanks sir. Thanks.

1238
01:31:01,649 --> 01:31:04,943
You have two hours.
That's lots of time.

1239
01:31:05,027 --> 01:31:06,445
- Do not hurry.
- But keep it moving.

1240
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:08,113
- Kusum...
- Yes, sir?

1241
01:31:08,281 --> 01:31:10,741
If you find yourself at a loss with
a question, give it 15 to 20 seconds

1242
01:31:11,159 --> 01:31:12,868
and then move on.

1243
01:31:12,951 --> 01:31:14,537
Come on then.

1244
01:31:15,454 --> 01:31:17,790
We'll eat well this evening, right?

1245
01:31:17,873 --> 01:31:18,916
Anand Sir?

1246
01:31:19,792 --> 01:31:21,335
Prithvi, how are you, young fellow?
- Hello sir.

1247
01:31:21,544 --> 01:31:22,753
How are you?
- I'm well...

1248
01:31:24,463 --> 01:31:25,923
...but why aren't you teaching us?

1249
01:31:27,341 --> 01:31:29,302
Is it our fault we were born rich?

1250
01:31:36,475 --> 01:31:37,768
Did you eat today?

1251
01:31:38,602 --> 01:31:39,853
Yes, of course.

1252
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:43,566
They haven't.

1253
01:31:49,363 --> 01:31:52,115
Hey guys this way.

1254
01:31:58,247 --> 01:31:58,831
Thanks

1255
01:32:06,547 --> 01:32:07,172
Hello.

1256
01:32:07,215 --> 01:32:08,757
Good morning sir.

1257
01:32:08,841 --> 01:32:10,050
Good morning, good morning.

1258
01:32:11,969 --> 01:32:13,387
My name is Purushottam.

1259
01:32:14,430 --> 01:32:16,349
I will be your invigilator today.

1260
01:32:34,658 --> 01:32:36,159
Raghunath Bharat speaking.

1261
01:32:36,201 --> 01:32:37,745
- Mr. Raghunath.
- Yes, speaking.

1262
01:32:40,373 --> 01:32:41,499
Who's speaking?

1263
01:32:45,294 --> 01:32:47,380
I have some important information for you.

1264
01:32:47,671 --> 01:32:48,797
And how do you know this?

1265
01:32:48,822 --> 01:32:51,025
This is for them,
let's begin distributing.

1266
01:32:51,774 --> 01:32:53,192
Lallan had everything:

1267
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:57,405
The money, the press,
the industrialists...

1268
01:32:58,864 --> 01:33:01,784
It was his last chance
to destroy the upstart class.

1269
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:03,578
He was leaving no stone unturned.

1270
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:05,079
Our students work very hard.

1271
01:33:05,455 --> 01:33:09,709
But every Evil Empire has its white knight,
waiting to take it down, armed only with the truth.

1272
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:11,168
Note down.

1273
01:33:13,128 --> 01:33:16,090
The public has turned out in large numbers
to see the result of the competition.

1274
01:33:16,674 --> 01:33:21,011
Perhaps they think the result
might give a new direction to society.

1275
01:33:22,054 --> 01:33:23,681
I'll come after the
results are declared.

1276
01:33:23,931 --> 01:33:24,724
See you.

1277
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:28,811
Where have you been, sir?

1278
01:33:28,853 --> 01:33:30,020
Here, where else?

1279
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:32,440
You don't even print
my picture these days!

1280
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:36,151
Come now, eat some of these,
they're very good, You'll enjoy them.

1281
01:33:54,086 --> 01:33:55,796
Welcome.
Welcome.

1282
01:33:56,171 --> 01:33:57,507
Namaskar, come, come.

1283
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:35,878
Now we would like to invite
Mr Purushottam to the mike

1284
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:37,630
We can't find Fugga.

1285
01:34:37,713 --> 01:34:41,008
He will announce the
results of the competition.

1286
01:34:41,551 --> 01:34:42,510
What does that mean?

1287
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:43,553
Please come, sir.

1288
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:44,887
It means, he's missing.

1289
01:34:45,888 --> 01:34:47,222
I've looked everywhere.

1290
01:34:47,306 --> 01:34:48,516
This is all yours.

1291
01:34:48,599 --> 01:34:50,225
And the last of our
money is missing too.

1292
01:34:50,726 --> 01:34:52,645
The competition was a tough one.

1293
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:55,773
Both teams seem to have worked hard.

1294
01:34:58,067 --> 01:35:01,862
The students of Excellence scored

1295
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:11,872
52 per cent.

1296
01:35:11,997 --> 01:35:14,542
Woo-hoo!

1297
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:16,961
Anandji's students scored

1298
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:22,007
49 per cent.

1299
01:35:25,135 --> 01:35:30,600
And so I announce that the winners
are the students from Excellence.

1300
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:32,560
Yay!

1301
01:35:34,269 --> 01:35:35,855
Thank you.

1302
01:35:36,021 --> 01:35:36,897
Thank you.

1303
01:35:37,022 --> 01:35:37,940
Now,

1304
01:35:39,942 --> 01:35:42,778
just as Anandji had agreed,

1305
01:35:43,112 --> 01:35:50,828
he must announce
his return to Excellence.

1306
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:53,080
Yay!

1307
01:35:56,542 --> 01:35:58,127
And will close...

1308
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:00,880
...his own centre.

1309
01:36:27,428 --> 01:36:28,387
Please come.

1310
01:36:43,213 --> 01:36:45,591
Remember we signed an agreement.

1311
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:51,722
Go on then.

1312
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:04,484
Anandji has been forced to do this.

1313
01:37:04,694 --> 01:37:06,862
There was no such agreement.

1314
01:37:07,029 --> 01:37:08,072
How do you know?

1315
01:37:10,105 --> 01:37:11,523
One minute, one minute.

1316
01:37:14,328 --> 01:37:16,038
If there was such an agreement...

1317
01:37:17,289 --> 01:37:19,041
...we want to see it.
To prove there was no undue pressure.

1318
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:20,125
Pressure?

1319
01:37:21,043 --> 01:37:21,961
What pressure.

1320
01:37:22,086 --> 01:37:25,590
I will show it to you right now.
Hold on, one minute.

1321
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:28,968
Purushottam Sir,
will you please show me that paper?

1322
01:37:29,343 --> 01:37:31,637
Things will be sorted out right now.

1323
01:37:31,721 --> 01:37:33,013
Why are you shouting?

1324
01:37:35,641 --> 01:37:36,642
What is it?

1325
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:39,103
Give us a minute here, we're looking.

1326
01:37:39,269 --> 01:37:40,942
Show it to us.

1327
01:37:42,064 --> 01:37:43,774
I have no idea where it went.
I had put it right here.

1328
01:37:43,983 --> 01:37:44,859
Hello?

1329
01:37:46,694 --> 01:37:48,320
Where can it have gone?

1330
01:37:48,528 --> 01:37:50,030
I handed it to you right then.

1331
01:37:51,073 --> 01:37:53,158
We were together
when I gave it to you.

1332
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:55,035
I can't see it.

1333
01:37:55,077 --> 01:37:55,911
Look for it.

1334
01:37:55,995 --> 01:38:01,416
When there is no agreement,
what's the fuss?

1335
01:38:02,001 --> 01:38:05,087
Then it's Anandji's decision
to close or not to close.

1336
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:07,923
Why are you getting so excited?

1337
01:38:08,007 --> 01:38:10,300
You shut your gob.

1338
01:38:11,135 --> 01:38:13,387
You eat my snacks and drink
my tea and then insult me?

1339
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:15,055
You can't threaten the media.

1340
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:17,016
I am not a lackey of corporate
interests like the rest.

1341
01:38:17,099 --> 01:38:18,475
My name is Raghunath Bharat.

1342
01:38:18,809 --> 01:38:20,102
Take note.

1343
01:38:20,435 --> 01:38:21,436
Noted, noted.

1344
01:38:21,812 --> 01:38:23,731
Now be silent.
Anandji, you tell them.

1345
01:38:24,398 --> 01:38:26,025
Tell them you signed an agreement.

1346
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:35,200
I signed nothing.
My centre continues.

1347
01:38:36,118 --> 01:38:37,745
What are you saying?

1348
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:40,122
What do you mean?

1349
01:38:40,665 --> 01:38:41,874
This is cheating?

1350
01:38:42,374 --> 01:38:47,046
And what destiny has
done to these children?

1351
01:38:47,379 --> 01:38:50,257
If that's not cheating,
what is it?

1352
01:38:50,507 --> 01:38:51,341
A blessing?

1353
01:38:52,259 --> 01:38:55,595
You swore on your brother's head.

1354
01:38:56,471 --> 01:38:57,890
He will die, if you break your word.

1355
01:38:58,057 --> 01:39:01,894
I have no intention of
dying any time soon, Lallanbabu.

1356
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:07,900
We have been shoved so far back...

1357
01:39:08,943 --> 01:39:13,072
...that even the God of Death
would take his time to get to us.

1358
01:39:18,828 --> 01:39:19,829
Thank you.

1359
01:39:30,491 --> 01:39:32,952
I stole that paper.

1360
01:39:36,303 --> 01:39:37,179
I know.

1361
01:39:39,181 --> 01:39:45,354
It is very difficult to put
something above your self-respect.

1362
01:39:48,733 --> 01:39:52,152
Anand Babu knows that his
duty comes before anything else.

1363
01:39:58,658 --> 01:40:00,119
You loved a good man.

1364
01:40:02,955 --> 01:40:05,332
I have good taste in men.

1365
01:40:18,178 --> 01:40:20,055
Why couldn't you crack the paper?

1366
01:40:25,352 --> 01:40:26,771
Was it tough?

1367
01:40:28,939 --> 01:40:29,815
No, sir.

1368
01:40:31,191 --> 01:40:32,860
Not that tough.

1369
01:40:33,485 --> 01:40:34,569
We knew most of it.

1370
01:40:44,579 --> 01:40:47,374
Do you lot want to go to IIT or not?

1371
01:40:50,335 --> 01:40:51,378
We do, sir.

1372
01:40:56,884 --> 01:40:57,802
Close your eyes.

1373
01:41:04,016 --> 01:41:07,269
Can you see yourself in the world of IIT?

1374
01:41:10,314 --> 01:41:11,941
Can you see it?

1375
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:15,986
We can, sir.

1376
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:18,280
What do you see?

1377
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:24,078
Sir, it's big, imposing.

1378
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:27,039
The rooms are air-conditioned,

1379
01:41:28,748 --> 01:41:32,336
the classrooms are big.

1380
01:41:41,595 --> 01:41:42,847
What else do you see?

1381
01:41:49,228 --> 01:41:50,354
It's so clean, so neat.

1382
01:41:50,645 --> 01:41:57,319
The kids are all wearing
expensive clothes, jeans, jackets.

1383
01:41:58,695 --> 01:42:02,992
Their hair is silky with shampoo.

1384
01:42:04,076 --> 01:42:06,036
They laugh at our oily hair.

1385
01:42:09,623 --> 01:42:11,583
They're all talking English, fluently.

1386
01:42:12,167 --> 01:42:13,878
And we can't keep up.

1387
01:42:15,129 --> 01:42:15,795
Want some?

1388
01:42:17,506 --> 01:42:18,924
It's good for your brain.

1389
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:21,260
Take it.

1390
01:42:21,801 --> 01:42:24,346
We don't have the guts to talk to them.

1391
01:42:24,972 --> 01:42:26,891
Our brains are jamming up.

1392
01:42:27,224 --> 01:42:27,975
Hello. Excuse me.

1393
01:42:29,559 --> 01:42:30,477
No, this is my seat.

1394
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:32,229
You will have to get up from here.

1395
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:35,983
You sit here,
I'll go somewhere else.

1396
01:42:36,066 --> 01:42:37,234
No, you sit down.

1397
01:42:37,317 --> 01:42:38,443
Sit down.

1398
01:42:48,996 --> 01:42:53,833
That day we were taking the exam with
kids whose houses we would have cleaned.

1399
01:42:54,209 --> 01:42:55,335
whose shoes we would have polished,

1400
01:42:55,961 --> 01:42:57,671
whose dustbins we would have emptied.

1401
01:42:59,131 --> 01:43:02,342
Sitting next to them
our brains just stopped.

1402
01:43:04,515 --> 01:43:06,886
Maybe that's why Fugga ran away, sir.

1403
01:43:09,975 --> 01:43:11,393
He was frightened.

1404
01:43:12,102 --> 01:43:16,440
He must have thought
we'll never catch up.

1405
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:19,318
We can't compete.

1406
01:43:20,152 --> 01:43:22,947
There's no place for us in
this English-speaking world, sir.

1407
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:37,419
Have you seen a film?

1408
01:43:41,631 --> 01:43:43,217
Any of you?

1409
01:43:46,678 --> 01:43:48,513
- No, sir.
- Anything?

1410
01:43:49,431 --> 01:43:52,434
Jai Santoshi Maa, sir.

1411
01:43:54,677 --> 01:43:55,972
- And?
- Sholay.

1412
01:43:58,565 --> 01:43:59,649
Right.

1413
01:44:03,778 --> 01:44:05,114
Then tomorrow, no studies.

1414
01:44:08,533 --> 01:44:15,749
It's Holi and at 11 am, you will go to

1415
01:44:17,459 --> 01:44:22,922
Gandhi Chowk, outside Excellence, and in
front of everyone, you will present a play.

1416
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:25,634
And all of it...

1417
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,307
In English.

1418
01:44:37,271 --> 01:44:41,566
Not a single word of Hindi.

1419
01:44:43,568 --> 01:44:45,320
If anyone says a single word in Hindi,
back to the village you go.

1420
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:48,782
Twenty minutes.
Not a word in Hindi

1421
01:44:52,411 --> 01:44:55,955
Remember: tomorrow, 11am,

1422
01:44:56,498 --> 01:45:00,044
Gandhi Chowk, only English.

1423
01:45:01,836 --> 01:45:03,297
Twenty minutes.

1424
01:45:05,674 --> 01:45:08,927
And until the play has ended,
no one leaves the stage.

1425
01:45:09,844 --> 01:45:12,764
Why do you want to strip
them in front of the world?

1426
01:45:13,473 --> 01:45:15,517
If I don't strip them, they won't learn.

1427
01:45:17,811 --> 01:45:19,688
And that thirty-first student?

1428
01:45:19,938 --> 01:45:20,897
What was his name?

01:45:22,232 --> 01:45:23,067
Ajju.

01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:24,526

01:45:31,408 --> 01:45:32,742

01:45:33,202 --> 01:45:33,910
I don't know.

1435
01:45:42,544 --> 01:45:45,464

01:46:56,826 --> 01:46:58,370

One condition...one condition..

1462
01:47:17,096 --> 01:47:18,932
But one condition.

1463
01:47:19,015 --> 01:47:20,350
- Don't dance.

1464
01:47:23,395 --> 01:47:27,691

It's Holi for you and Holi for me
It's Holi for us all.

1524

It's a Holy Holi happy Holiday.

1525
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:33,251
Hey, what happened to the English?

1526
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:36,546
English Holi, Happy Holi, yaar.

1527
01:50:37,171 --> 01:50:40,299
I won't speak English

1528
01:50:40,759 --> 01:50:43,928
Not to my father-in-law.

1529
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:47,557
My heart is Bihari and so is my tongue

1530
01:50:47,849 --> 01:50:50,852
And my heart is my law.

1531
01:50:50,935 --> 01:50:54,481
He told me you told him
I told you no tell her

1532
01:50:54,564 --> 01:50:57,942
I told her no tell you
I told you no tell her

1533
01:50:58,026 --> 01:51:01,530
I told you she tell me
He told her to tell you

1534
01:51:01,613 --> 01:51:05,033
So tell me to tell you
She told him to tell her

1535
01:51:05,283 --> 01:51:06,868
—That's English for you.

1536
01:51:07,243 --> 01:51:11,080
The way of the world
is odd in the extreme.

1537
01:51:11,415 --> 01:51:14,793
No one cares about your dreams.

1538
01:51:14,959 --> 01:51:18,337
If you're speaking English,
that's enough.

1539
01:51:18,547 --> 01:51:21,800
So what if your English is rough?

1540
01:51:22,091 --> 01:51:28,932
You throw stones, we reply with rocks.

1541
01:51:29,223 --> 01:51:35,980
You throw stones, we reply with rocks.

1542
01:51:36,355 --> 01:51:39,818
- Basanti no dance

Do you get what I am saying?

1547
01:51:55,208 --> 01:51:58,920
Or are you only listening
to how I'm saying it?

1548
01:52:02,674 --> 01:52:05,802
The road to Ramgad is a minefield.

1549
01:52:06,135 --> 01:52:09,556
Tell your father-in-law to be careful.

1550
01:52:09,806 --> 01:52:12,809
No police station, no facilities.

1551
01:52:13,184 --> 01:52:16,312
Not even a greasy spoon café.

1552
01:52:17,271 --> 01:52:20,358
We chase bandits on horseback.

1553
01:52:20,859 --> 01:52:23,945
We flash knives and gun racks.

1554
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:27,574
Basanti sweats up a storm.

1555
01:52:27,949 --> 01:52:31,285
The dacoits chew on a plug.

1556
01:52:31,536 --> 01:52:38,001
You throw stones, we reply with rocks.

1557
01:52:38,668 --> 01:52:45,216
You throw stones, we reply with rocks.

1558

Basanti no dance

1561
01:52:56,352 --> 01:52:59,731

Basanti no dance

1569
01:53:24,923 --> 01:53:27,091
in phront of these dogs.

1570
01:53:28,426 --> 01:53:30,762
Basanti no dance

1571
01:53:31,971 --> 01:53:34,057
in phront of these dogs.

1572
01:53:41,355 --> 01:53:43,357
Basanti no dance
-I'll write about you.

1573
01:53:49,948 --> 01:53:52,033
We had fought English and won...

1574
01:53:52,366 --> 01:53:55,912
...but the fight to conquer
hunger was still to be won.

1575
01:54:02,893 --> 01:54:05,980
If Anand Sir could solve
any mathematical problem...

1576
01:54:06,313 --> 01:54:08,023
You lookin' at me, kid?

1577
01:54:08,107 --> 01:54:09,441
...he could also confuse
any mathematical issue.

1578
01:54:16,281 --> 01:54:17,366
Are you Ghantewala?

1579
01:54:17,533 --> 01:54:18,618
No, no.

1580
01:54:19,368 --> 01:54:21,537
That was my father.

1581
01:54:22,329 --> 01:54:24,206
I am Ghantewala Junior.

1582
01:54:24,289 --> 01:54:25,708
This shop is going to close down.

1583
01:54:26,125 --> 01:54:27,376
Are you nuts?

1584
01:54:29,086 --> 01:54:31,463
I employ eighty people here.

1585
01:54:31,547 --> 01:54:34,466
In three years,
four months and twenty-one days,

1586
01:54:34,550 --> 01:54:36,594
this shop is going to close down.

1587
01:54:36,802 --> 01:54:39,805
You an astrologer or something?

1588
01:54:40,347 --> 01:54:43,350
A mathematician.

1589
01:54:44,059 --> 01:54:46,729
I hate seeing someone
else's calculations go wrong.

1590
01:54:47,897 --> 01:54:49,356
Since you seem like a good man,

1591
01:54:49,523 --> 01:54:51,609
I thought I should explain it to you.

1592
01:54:53,736 --> 01:54:59,950
Let us say about 1500
people eat here every day.

1593
01:55:01,201 --> 01:55:08,292
If each spends fifty per head,
that's Rs 75,000 per day.

1594
01:55:08,417 --> 01:55:10,419
That's your income every day.

1595
01:55:10,628 --> 01:55:15,633
In a month that's two
million fifty thousand.

1596
01:55:16,801 --> 01:55:18,093
Right?

1597
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:22,765
Fifty into fifteen hundred means
four hundred and fifty thousand.

1598
01:55:24,308 --> 01:55:25,392
But there are problems.

1599
01:55:26,644 --> 01:55:28,103
Your clients are abandoning you.

1600
01:55:28,187 --> 01:55:31,440
The A/C restaurant
that's opened next door?

1601
01:55:31,649 --> 01:55:34,359
Twenty per cent means 300 people.

1602
01:55:34,484 --> 01:55:36,821
Have you considered depreciation?

1603
01:55:37,237 --> 01:55:39,990
At 13 per cent. Now adjust for
inflation Raw material costs

1604
01:55:40,199 --> 01:55:43,703
Over 30 days,
how much does this become?

1605
01:55:44,411 --> 01:55:46,121
Four hundred and fifty thousand.

1606
01:55:48,666 --> 01:55:50,417
How much was your profit?

1607
01:55:51,376 --> 01:55:52,419
Nothing.

1608
01:55:52,795 --> 01:55:55,631
In mathematics, we call that zero.

1609
01:55:56,423 --> 01:55:59,009
Anand Sir caught him
in a maelstrom of numbers

1610
01:55:59,259 --> 01:56:02,471
From which only he
could free poor Ghantewala.

1611
01:56:02,722 --> 01:56:04,598
That's the way of it.

1612
01:56:05,099 --> 01:56:06,684
Things change...

1613
01:56:07,893 --> 01:56:09,186
...in a flash.

1614
01:56:15,442 --> 01:56:18,445
I told you all this
because you're a nice man.

1615
01:56:18,904 --> 01:56:20,364
See you around.

1616
01:56:21,198 --> 01:56:22,324
Hold on, hold on.

1617
01:56:24,118 --> 01:56:25,619
You diagnosed the disease.

1618
01:56:26,328 --> 01:56:27,747
Is there a cure?

1619
01:56:28,372 --> 01:56:30,457
Anand Sir had a cure.
Of course he did.

1620
01:56:31,250 --> 01:56:32,167
There is.

1621
01:56:32,251 --> 01:56:33,418
But it will cost.

1622
01:56:33,585 --> 01:56:37,464
You will have to give me rations
for thirty people for three months.

1623
01:56:37,882 --> 01:56:39,759
But first today's lunch.

1624
01:56:45,639 --> 01:56:46,598
Done.

1625
01:56:46,849 --> 01:56:49,309
Sit down, please explain.

1626
01:56:51,645 --> 01:56:53,147
Why didn't you do this earlier?

1627
01:56:55,149 --> 01:56:56,483
Maybe they're right.

1628
01:56:57,484 --> 01:57:00,195
Don't they say: Necessity
is the mother of invention?

1629
01:57:10,013 --> 01:57:11,681
But storm clouds...

1630
01:57:12,223 --> 01:57:14,768
...were beginning to darken the sky.

1631
01:57:25,236 --> 01:57:26,529
Are you fine

1632
01:57:26,947 --> 01:57:29,324
- Didn't you bring the lady wife?
- Madam will come later, she is a little busy

1633
01:57:29,407 --> 01:57:30,992
Okay. Okay

1634
01:57:32,452 --> 01:57:33,411
Take this.

1635
01:57:33,494 --> 01:57:35,621
May you live a long and happy life.

1636
01:57:35,914 --> 01:57:38,083
Happy birthday, Sir.

1637
01:57:42,087 --> 01:57:42,838
Sir?

1638
01:57:56,142 --> 01:57:58,770
You were a teacher.
What did I make you?

1639
01:58:02,899 --> 01:58:04,359
CEO, sir.

1640
01:58:05,610 --> 01:58:06,694
Not a CEO.

1641
01:58:07,278 --> 01:58:09,614
I made you part of the coaching mafia.

1642
01:58:11,657 --> 01:58:14,285
And did I do that so you could ruin me?

1643
01:58:16,704 --> 01:58:22,627
Here I am trying to restore Bihar's lost glory,
bring back the splendour of ancient Nalanda.

1644
01:58:23,753 --> 01:58:26,714
I've invested billions so that
education can be a path to progress.

1645
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:28,800
I've opened dozens of classes
all over the UP-Bihar belt.

1646
01:58:29,717 --> 01:58:32,888
We have a joint venture in Gujarat,
investors are coming...

1647
01:58:34,555 --> 01:58:37,308
and what do we have here?

1648
01:58:37,976 --> 01:58:41,771
Bring those newspapers.

1649
01:58:43,148 --> 01:58:44,065
Bring them here.

1650
01:59:03,626 --> 01:59:04,460
Here you are, sir

1651
01:59:05,128 --> 01:59:07,297
Don't stand behind me, all hangdog.

1652
01:59:07,380 --> 01:59:08,548
Come face me like a man.

1653
01:59:11,634 --> 01:59:12,593
What is this?

1654
01:59:14,512 --> 01:59:15,638
What is this?

1655
01:59:15,763 --> 01:59:16,764
In Hindi.

1656
01:59:19,225 --> 01:59:20,185
And here...

1657
01:59:21,769 --> 01:59:22,896
in English.

1658
01:59:24,105 --> 01:59:26,900
Everyone's talking about Anand Kumar.

1659
01:59:28,443 --> 01:59:31,029
Do you know what this means?

1660
01:59:31,571 --> 01:59:36,326
People will start asking why they have
to pay for what he's giving away free.

1661
01:59:37,118 --> 01:59:39,787
And they'll say we're
looting the people.

1662
01:59:39,996 --> 01:59:42,790
We're dacoits.

1663
01:59:44,459 --> 01:59:45,835
And what will the investors say?

1664
01:59:46,461 --> 01:59:47,212
Yes, sir.

1665
01:59:49,755 --> 01:59:50,840
Sir, I tried.

1666
01:59:52,467 --> 01:59:53,801
I cut his electricity off.

1667
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:56,096
I sent a woman to defame him.

1668
01:59:56,596 --> 01:59:57,638
I sent him a death threat.

1669
01:59:58,431 --> 01:59:59,807
And we had a competition

1670
02:00:00,641 --> 02:00:01,851
OUT!

1671
02:00:08,816 --> 02:00:11,819
A kiddie game?

1672
02:00:12,487 --> 02:00:14,948
I cut off his electricity?
I sent a girl to defame him...

1673
02:00:18,826 --> 02:00:20,703
I want no risks.

1674
02:00:20,954 --> 02:00:25,458
Not one of his students will
sit for the exam, do you get that?

1675
02:00:26,417 --> 02:00:27,293
Got it?

1676
02:00:30,611 --> 02:00:31,547
Got it, sir.

1677
02:00:31,839 --> 02:00:32,882
No, you haven't.

1678
02:00:33,049 --> 02:00:34,800
I won't believe you until
you say it three times.

1679
02:00:34,842 --> 02:00:36,469
Go on then.
Repeat it for me.

1680
02:00:37,887 --> 02:00:39,847
I understand, sir.

1681
02:00:41,141 --> 02:00:41,975
I understand.

1682
02:00:45,686 --> 02:00:48,273
You're in the big league now, Lallan.

1683
02:00:48,398 --> 02:00:49,857
You're dealing with the big boys.

1684
02:00:51,734 --> 02:00:54,779
These fancy suits you wear?
I'll strip you naked.

1685
02:00:54,862 --> 02:00:56,906
Don't show your face at the party.

1686
02:00:58,866 --> 02:00:59,867
Get out.

1687
02:01:03,121 --> 02:01:03,955
Hey you!

1688
02:01:21,222 --> 02:01:23,599
Where does that teacher live?

1689
02:01:25,351 --> 02:01:26,894
Hello, buddy, where's the teacher?

1690
02:01:26,936 --> 02:01:28,563
Down that lane?

1691
02:01:30,065 --> 02:01:30,940
Masterji...

1692
02:01:32,233 --> 02:01:33,193
Masterji, Masterji.

1693
02:01:34,110 --> 02:01:35,070
Hey, Raghunathji.

1694
02:01:38,698 --> 02:01:39,949
Why is he getting into this mess?

1695
02:01:40,616 --> 02:01:42,160
You're teaching, stick with that.

1696
02:01:42,743 --> 02:01:43,494
How are you?

1697
02:01:43,995 --> 02:01:44,912
Never mind how I am.

1698
02:01:45,830 --> 02:01:48,041
They've put out
a contract on your head.

1699
02:01:48,874 --> 02:01:49,792
What?

1700
02:01:50,710 --> 02:01:52,878
They've put out
a contract on your head.

1701
02:01:55,131 --> 02:01:56,549
Listen to him.

1702
02:01:56,632 --> 02:01:59,594
I am a professional,
a thorough professional, you get it?

1703
02:02:01,971 --> 02:02:03,514
But I will not kill you.

1704
02:02:04,557 --> 02:02:05,516
Do you know why?

1705
02:02:06,934 --> 02:02:07,977
When I was in jail...

1706
02:02:08,936 --> 02:02:10,521
...your father made up a story about me

1707
02:02:10,605 --> 02:02:13,983
working in the city
and kept my mother happy.

1708
02:02:14,525 --> 02:02:15,943
Those fake letters let her live.

1709
02:02:16,402 --> 02:02:18,404
Those letters kept my mother happy.

1710
02:02:19,197 --> 02:02:20,365
Which is why
I'm here

1711
02:02:22,158 --> 02:02:23,076
to warn you.

1712
02:02:24,660 --> 02:02:25,995
Nevertheless, it will happen very soon.

1713
02:02:27,122 --> 02:02:28,581
Be careful.

1714
02:02:39,425 --> 02:02:40,843
I have a request to make

1715
02:02:41,677 --> 02:02:42,595
Go on then.

1716
02:02:44,347 --> 02:02:49,018
If something happens to me,
don't write about it.

1717
02:02:51,020 --> 02:02:51,979
Why?

1718
02:02:53,189 --> 02:02:56,151
Many people are trying
to bring about change.

1719
02:02:58,861 --> 02:03:00,446
They might lose their courage.

1720
02:03:03,241 --> 02:03:04,033
I'll be seeing you.

1721
02:03:04,617 --> 02:03:05,618
Look, Pranavji,

1722
02:03:06,994 --> 02:03:09,247
if death is written in Anandji's fate,

1723
02:03:09,914 --> 02:03:11,999
a hundred policemen
won't be able to stop it.

1724
02:03:12,250 --> 02:03:15,211
And if it isn't written in his fate,
an atom bomb won't be able to harm him.

1725
02:03:15,461 --> 02:03:17,213
I didn't come here for
a lecture in philosophy.

1726
02:03:18,005 --> 02:03:19,632
I came to ask for police protection.

1727
02:03:20,007 --> 02:03:22,302
This is not philosophy, sir.

1728
02:03:22,468 --> 02:03:24,470
But try to understand my plight.

1729
02:03:25,763 --> 02:03:26,847
Our workload is huge.

1730
02:03:27,056 --> 02:03:29,600
And I have only 41 constables.

1731
02:03:29,850 --> 02:03:31,894
Many are on duty to protect ministers.

1732
02:03:32,312 --> 02:03:35,022
Five are outside the
temple after that incident.

1733
02:03:36,023 --> 02:03:37,024
Twelve are left.

1734
02:03:37,442 --> 02:03:40,736
Of which two are heart patients
so they can't be given strenuous duties.

1735
02:03:41,028 --> 02:03:44,199
Three have diabetes so they
can't be given stressful work.

1736
02:03:44,699 --> 02:03:46,659
And one of them has a pregnant wife.

1737
02:03:46,742 --> 02:03:47,785
He's gone for the delivery.

1738
02:03:47,952 --> 02:03:51,456
You tell me how I can spare someone.

1739
02:04:00,256 --> 02:04:01,174
Where's Pranav now?

1740
02:04:01,716 --> 02:04:03,050
The children's food is ready.

1741
02:04:03,259 --> 02:04:04,469
You'll have to take it there.

1742
02:05:15,037 --> 02:05:17,207
There was a letter.

1743
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:19,041
Hold on a moment.

1744
02:05:22,044 --> 02:05:23,921
Greetings, Anand Sir.

1745
02:05:24,004 --> 02:05:25,626
You dropped your towel.

1746
02:05:26,048 --> 02:05:28,133
- Look at me.
- Pick up your tiffin carrier.

1747
02:05:28,218 --> 02:05:28,926
Let me help.

1748
02:05:29,093 --> 02:05:31,929
I seem to have dropped everything.

1749
02:05:32,012 --> 02:05:34,014
Let me get this.

1750
02:05:34,056 --> 02:05:35,725
Thank you so much.

1751
02:05:35,850 --> 02:05:37,101
No need for thanks.

1752
02:05:37,268 --> 02:05:38,845
This was only our duty...

1753
02:05:47,304 --> 02:05:48,447
Is that any place to shoot him?

1754
02:05:48,472 --> 02:05:50,905
You should have shot him in the head.

1755
02:05:51,868 --> 02:05:53,511
This darned thing is stuck.
It won't budge.

1756
02:05:53,557 --> 02:05:54,840
What do you mean stuck?

1757
02:05:55,669 --> 02:05:57,488
Tell you what,
shall we crush his head with a stone?

1758
02:05:57,513 --> 02:05:58,973
Are you nuts?

1759
02:06:02,227 --> 02:06:03,687
Pick him up and let
the train do the work.

1760
02:07:03,817 --> 02:07:05,027
Is he dead?

1761
02:07:07,571 --> 02:07:09,615
Did you kill him or not?

1762
02:07:10,032 --> 02:07:11,825
The minister is on the phone.

1763
02:07:11,909 --> 02:07:13,243
We shot him.

1764
02:07:14,202 --> 02:07:15,287
That's all we know.

1765
02:07:16,455 --> 02:07:18,248
That's all you know?

1766
02:07:19,417 --> 02:07:21,251
You shot him and you
can't tell me he's dead.

1767
02:07:24,338 --> 02:07:26,382
Sir, there was some confusion.

1768
02:07:27,341 --> 02:07:31,178
They're saying they don't
know if he's dead or alive.

1769
02:07:31,595 --> 02:07:33,013
Idiots!

1770
02:07:33,597 --> 02:07:35,182
We did our best.

1771
02:07:35,265 --> 02:07:36,141
Sir, we shot him in the stomach

1772
02:07:36,224 --> 02:07:38,060
and then dragged him on to
the tracks for a train to finish off.

1773
02:07:38,185 --> 02:07:39,937
He would have died but then
his brother came on the scene.

1774
02:07:40,020 --> 02:07:42,189
Shut up.
Shut the muck up.

1775
02:07:44,274 --> 02:07:48,195
If he survives,
he becomes a hero, a media hero.

1776
02:07:48,278 --> 02:07:49,447
Should we go kill
him in the hospital then?

1777
02:07:49,530 --> 02:07:50,823
We'll barge in and finish him off.

1778
02:07:50,906 --> 02:07:56,036
Oh right, kill him in front of
everyone and make a martyr out of him.

1779
02:08:07,423 --> 02:08:08,882
Listen.

1780
02:08:09,883 --> 02:08:12,344
Take a whole bunch
and go out there...

1781
02:08:14,221 --> 02:08:16,264
...and make it seem
like a Naxalite attack.

1782
02:08:16,306 --> 02:08:17,641
No one should survive.

1783
02:08:18,141 --> 02:08:20,143
Kill Anand and
his students, in the hospital.

1784
02:08:20,310 --> 02:08:22,938
If even one of them sits
for it and gets into IIT...

1785
02:08:23,021 --> 02:08:24,982
Anand becomes a hero.

1786
02:08:25,148 --> 02:08:29,069
Before the exam, I want all this over.

1787
02:08:30,153 --> 02:08:31,029
Now go.

1788
02:08:31,447 --> 02:08:34,074
Everything is over
Get on with it.

1789
02:08:35,242 --> 02:08:36,660
Let's go.

1790
02:08:36,952 --> 02:08:39,037
Doctor, Doctor,
my brother, he's been shot.

1791
02:08:39,121 --> 02:08:40,038
Please, take a look at him.

1792
02:08:42,875 --> 02:08:47,129
I beg of you, please, he's bleeding,

1793
02:08:48,088 --> 02:08:49,214
We'll pay anything.

1794
02:08:49,297 --> 02:08:50,340
Get away with you.

1795
02:08:53,343 --> 02:08:54,344
Fill out this form.

1796
02:08:54,386 --> 02:08:57,305
Please admit him first.

1797
02:08:58,140 --> 02:08:59,307
This is Anand Kumar.

1798
02:08:59,349 --> 02:09:01,018
He teaches poor children free.

1799
02:09:01,351 --> 02:09:04,104
- Please do something
- You're going to teach me?

1800
02:09:05,105 --> 02:09:06,231
Do your work.

1801
02:09:07,399 --> 02:09:08,358
Now these people are going to teach us.

1802
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:09,943
Open your eyes, son.

1803
02:09:11,654 --> 02:09:13,363
Pranav, please hurry.

1804
02:09:13,405 --> 02:09:15,365
Yes, yes, Ma.
I'm bringing the doctor right away.

1805
02:09:15,407 --> 02:09:17,367
- Hurry!
- Coming.

1806
02:09:17,409 --> 02:09:19,202
I'll hit you so hard,

1807
02:09:19,662 --> 02:09:21,705
You'll become an ENT
specialist in a minute.

1808
02:09:21,789 --> 02:09:22,873
Hey!

1809
02:09:22,956 --> 02:09:25,167
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- Shut up.

1810
02:09:25,375 --> 02:09:28,211
No, no, don't be like that.

1811
02:09:28,671 --> 02:09:30,380
- I'll fill the form.
- Don't worry. Ignore him.

1812
02:09:30,422 --> 02:09:32,466
He got his seat in medical
college with a donation.

1813
02:09:32,550 --> 02:09:33,801
He knows nothing.

1814
02:09:33,967 --> 02:09:36,011
You don't worry about a thing.

1815
02:09:36,094 --> 02:09:38,055
Anand Sir is like a God to us.

1816
02:09:38,388 --> 02:09:40,182
Hey Raju, get over here.

1817
02:09:40,516 --> 02:09:42,601
Check his vitals.

1818
02:09:42,685 --> 02:09:43,811
Get his blood group.

1819
02:09:44,019 --> 02:09:45,228
Organise donors.

1820
02:09:45,312 --> 02:09:47,105
And get Dr Jha to come here.

1821
02:09:47,314 --> 02:09:48,023
I am filling the form.

1822
02:09:48,106 --> 02:09:49,066
Don't worry about a thing.

1823
02:09:49,149 --> 02:09:50,568
We won't let anything happen to him.

1824
02:09:52,402 --> 02:09:54,279
Here.

1825
02:09:54,697 --> 02:09:56,073
Get this.

1826
02:10:29,189 --> 02:10:32,776
Tonight, they're going to come.
In large numbers.

1827
02:10:33,443 --> 02:10:35,571
With guns and weapons.

1828
02:10:35,654 --> 02:10:37,364
They want to kill you.

1829
02:10:37,489 --> 02:10:38,699
Oh God!

1830
02:10:39,241 --> 02:10:41,201
and they want to kill the students too.

1831
02:10:44,371 --> 02:10:45,539
Why did you run away?

1832
02:10:46,373 --> 02:10:48,375
I funked it, sir.

1833
02:10:50,085 --> 02:10:53,338
I thought we would never
be able to compete with Excellence.

1834
02:10:54,172 --> 02:10:55,382
Are you happy?

1835
02:10:56,424 --> 02:10:58,636
No, no.

1836
02:10:59,469 --> 02:11:00,554
At least...

1837
02:11:02,430 --> 02:11:07,728
...educate your children well.

1838
02:11:08,395 --> 02:11:09,730
Quick, now.

1839
02:11:13,817 --> 02:11:15,778
Nothing is going to happen to you.

1840
02:11:16,111 --> 02:11:17,154
Move, move, move.

1841
02:11:17,237 --> 02:11:18,405
One minute

1842
02:11:18,906 --> 02:11:20,282
What is it?

1843
02:11:21,742 --> 02:11:23,451
Hey, kids, Anand Sir wants a word.

1844
02:11:31,752 --> 02:11:33,837
This is the time.

1845
02:11:36,131 --> 02:11:38,508
The time to make the leap.

1846
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:45,098
You've immersed yourself in theory;
time for practicals.

1847
02:11:47,059 --> 02:11:48,476
Time to turn knowledge into action...

1848
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:50,604
Learn: and you conquer the world.

1849
02:11:50,688 --> 02:11:53,273
- ...the time to fight.
- But learn to know your self.

1850
02:11:53,356 --> 02:11:55,651
Learn: and obstacles are defeated.

1851
02:11:55,734 --> 02:11:58,111
But learn if those habits are your own.

1852
02:11:58,195 --> 02:12:00,614
To learn is to defeat all foes

1853
02:12:00,698 --> 02:12:04,534
To learn is to crush all woes.

1854
02:12:13,919 --> 02:12:15,879
There are two kinds
of people in the world:

1855
02:12:17,505 --> 02:12:18,966
One is Ricky.

1856
02:12:20,467 --> 02:12:24,554
and Bholu.

1857
02:12:25,555 --> 02:12:29,226
They'll come with more confidence

1858
02:12:30,686 --> 02:12:32,562
And less ammunition.

1859
02:12:32,855 --> 02:12:35,190
They must be sure we're sitting ducks.

1860
02:12:35,398 --> 02:12:39,444
I agree. For a half-dead teacher
and some students?

1861
02:12:39,527 --> 02:12:41,029
How much would they think they need?

1862
02:12:42,239 --> 02:12:43,573
We need to exhaust their bullets.

1863
02:12:45,408 --> 02:12:46,576
Without hurting them

1864
02:12:46,827 --> 02:12:47,745
Why?

1865
02:12:48,662 --> 02:12:50,580
Or what difference between them and us?

1866
02:12:52,332 --> 02:12:54,877
They brought two guns and a knife.

1867
02:12:55,293 --> 02:12:56,503
Not even too many bullets.

1868
02:12:56,586 --> 02:12:57,880
First we make sure
they run out of bullets

1869
02:12:57,963 --> 02:13:00,215
and then we lure them into
a gas chamber and lock them in.

1870
02:13:05,595 --> 02:13:08,598
Listen, the hospital is
going to be attacked by Naxals.

1871
02:13:08,682 --> 02:13:09,892
Get everyone into one room.

1872
02:13:09,975 --> 02:13:10,768
What?

1873
02:13:13,228 --> 02:13:14,604
Are there rocks in your ears?

1874
02:13:14,646 --> 02:13:15,773
MTurn off all the lights.

1875
02:13:16,273 --> 02:13:18,358
Get on with it.
We'll take care of the rest.

1876
02:13:18,441 --> 02:13:19,943
We have nothing, they have it all.

1877
02:13:20,027 --> 02:13:21,444
How can we compete?

1878
02:13:21,695 --> 02:13:24,614
Today, it isn't the
prince who mounts the throne

1879
02:13:25,657 --> 02:13:28,994
but the man who proves his worth.

1880
02:13:43,801 --> 02:13:46,344
The hospital seems deserted today.

1881
02:13:48,722 --> 02:13:51,183
Learn: and you conquer the world.

1882
02:13:51,266 --> 02:13:54,061
But learn to know your self.

1883
02:13:54,144 --> 02:13:56,688
Learn: and obstacles are defeated.

1884
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:11,244
Learn: and you conquer the world.

1885
02:14:11,328 --> 02:14:13,663
But learn to know your self.

1886
02:14:13,747 --> 02:14:16,208
Learn: and obstacles are defeated.

1887
02:14:16,291 --> 02:14:18,710
But learn if those habits are your own.

1888
02:14:18,794 --> 02:14:21,671
To learn is to defeat all foes

1889
02:14:21,797 --> 02:14:24,758
- The tyre is heading towards the petrol.
- To learn is to crush all woes.

1890
02:14:28,804 --> 02:14:31,473
Learning is your auspicious shield

1891
02:14:31,556 --> 02:14:34,226
Learn: for it levels the field.

1892
02:14:34,309 --> 02:14:36,436
He who learns will conquer the world.

1893
02:14:36,519 --> 02:14:38,730
Learn: for justice comes
flowing from learning.

1894
02:14:38,814 --> 02:14:42,275
Learn: it makes you sure of who you are

1895
02:14:42,567 --> 02:14:44,611
Radhe, Radhe...

1896
02:14:45,112 --> 02:14:46,113
The sound is coming from there.

1897
02:14:46,446 --> 02:14:49,532
Radhe, Radhe...

1898
02:14:49,950 --> 02:14:51,159
Where is the sound coming from?

1899
02:14:53,871 --> 02:14:54,872
Now look there.

1900
02:15:01,253 --> 02:15:03,546
This is the law of reflection.

1901
02:15:03,964 --> 02:15:07,634
That means the sound may
not be originating from the

1902
02:15:07,885 --> 02:15:09,677
place where it seems to be coming from.

1903
02:15:09,761 --> 02:15:14,766
If the angle of incidence
is equal to the angle of reflection...

1904
02:15:15,392 --> 02:15:18,270
Radhe, Radhe...

1905
02:15:19,646 --> 02:15:21,064
Radhe...

1906
02:15:22,482 --> 02:15:24,818
Learn: and you conquer the world.

1907
02:15:24,902 --> 02:15:27,737
- No one here.
- But learn to know your self.

1908
02:15:27,779 --> 02:15:29,865
Learn: and obstacles are defeated.

1909
02:15:29,948 --> 02:15:32,575
- They're over there.
- But learn if those habits are your own.

1910
02:15:32,659 --> 02:15:35,245
- No, no, over there.
- To learn is to defeat all foes

1911
02:15:35,328 --> 02:15:38,123
To learn is to crush all woes.

1912
02:15:42,752 --> 02:15:44,754
Keep some bullets for later.
You might need them.

1913
02:15:54,097 --> 02:15:55,598
Locks on both sides.

1914
02:15:55,974 --> 02:15:57,559
Are they outside or inside?

1915
02:15:57,642 --> 02:15:58,768
Step away.

1916
02:16:11,781 --> 02:16:13,783
Be very quiet.

1917
02:16:16,703 --> 02:16:18,038
Easy.

1918
02:16:28,798 --> 02:16:31,468
Where are those kids hiding?

1919
02:16:36,806 --> 02:16:40,768
There's something spooky
about this hospital.

1920
02:16:42,604 --> 02:16:45,607
The sound seems to be coming
from there; that's where they are.

1921
02:16:45,690 --> 02:16:48,235
Hold on.

1922
02:16:49,444 --> 02:16:51,238
They're fooling us.

1923
02:17:03,583 --> 02:17:07,379
When light moves
from one lens to another

1924
02:17:07,462 --> 02:17:12,175
The object in between can vanish.

1925
02:17:13,176 --> 02:17:18,390
Means what is between can disappear

1926
02:17:47,544 --> 02:17:49,879
Learn: and you conquer the world.

1927
02:17:49,921 --> 02:17:52,465
But learn to know your self.

1928
02:17:53,091 --> 02:17:54,926
Don't be in a hurry
to pick up your pens.

1929
02:17:55,843 --> 02:17:59,889
First smile, close your eyes., and you will
find a solution. build a formula in your head.

1930
02:18:00,515 --> 02:18:03,268
- Hey, let me go.
- To learn is to crush all woes.

1931
02:18:09,941 --> 02:18:11,901
Sorry, let's go.

1932
02:18:16,406 --> 02:18:17,949
What's going on?

1933
02:18:18,616 --> 02:18:20,493
Where are we?

1934
02:18:21,619 --> 02:18:23,163
What's this

1935
02:18:23,871 --> 02:18:25,790
Are you going to kill one of your own?

1936
02:18:26,749 --> 02:18:28,543
Open the window.

1937
02:18:50,357 --> 02:18:55,862
Cleverclogs Tripathi knows the
score of every match before it starts

1938
02:18:55,945 --> 02:18:59,282
because the score before
a match starts is always the same:

1939
02:19:00,908 --> 02:19:03,203
zero - zero.

1940
02:19:08,875 --> 02:19:11,002
- Liked it?
- YES SIR!

1941
02:19:11,169 --> 02:19:12,962
You got distracted
from the real problem.

1942
02:19:13,755 --> 02:19:15,006
Where was the problem?

1943
02:19:15,382 --> 02:19:16,758
Here.

1944
02:19:17,300 --> 02:19:18,593
Where were you looking?

1945
02:19:18,676 --> 02:19:20,011
There.

1946
02:19:24,015 --> 02:19:25,975
This is called a distraction.

1947
02:19:26,017 --> 02:19:28,270
- What is it?
- Distraction!

1948
02:19:28,353 --> 02:19:29,854
Got it?

1949
02:19:29,937 --> 02:19:32,649
Hey, there are more coming.

1950
02:19:33,024 --> 02:19:34,234
Let them come.

1951
02:19:44,077 --> 02:19:46,329
How does the eagle catch the mouse?

1952
02:19:48,290 --> 02:19:51,876
She does not swoop on
Point A where the mouse is

1953
02:19:51,959 --> 02:19:54,379
She changes her angle to

1954
02:19:55,463 --> 02:20:00,802
the Point B where the mouse will be.

1955
02:20:01,010 --> 02:20:02,345
42 degrees.

1956
02:20:15,108 --> 02:20:16,818
What's that?

1957
02:20:23,700 --> 02:20:28,330
That night we used all that
we knew to fight what we had to face.

1958
02:20:29,164 --> 02:20:31,666
But not a thing came near Anand Sir.

1959
02:20:34,085 --> 02:20:35,128
After a night of fighting,

1960
02:20:35,212 --> 02:20:37,172
we went and slept in front
of the examination centres.

1961
02:20:38,089 --> 02:20:42,177
All thirty sat;
I gave the exam the next year.

1962
02:20:43,970 --> 02:20:45,805
And the question still was:

1963
02:20:46,514 --> 02:20:48,350
how many of those thirty
were going to make it to IIT?

1964
02:20:49,392 --> 02:20:51,644
How many were going back to
the dirt and the dung and the darkness?

1965
02:20:53,480 --> 02:20:56,107
This was the moment of Bihar's destiny

1966
02:20:56,191 --> 02:20:59,152
To see if the old tradition would hold...

1967
02:21:00,237 --> 02:21:05,158
...Or if those who were truly
capable were going to mount the throne.

1968
02:21:25,720 --> 02:21:27,514
Now close your eyes...

1969
02:21:30,183 --> 02:21:32,101
...and take thought for your parents.

1970
02:21:49,452 --> 02:21:51,288
Where is the money?

1971
02:21:52,121 --> 02:21:54,123
I have nothing.

1972
02:21:55,708 --> 02:21:56,793
Where is the money?

1973
02:21:56,876 --> 02:21:58,878
- Where is the money?
- There's nothing left.

1974
02:21:58,961 --> 02:22:00,755
You've taken it all.

1975
02:23:45,067 --> 02:23:47,487
Urmila, Urmila, you're in.

1976
02:24:33,533 --> 02:24:34,659
It happened.

1977
02:24:36,035 --> 02:24:36,953
What?

1978
02:24:42,750 --> 02:24:44,461
They did it.

1979
02:24:47,088 --> 02:24:48,214
All thirty.

1980
02:24:50,132 --> 02:24:51,634
All thirty.

1981
02:24:55,262 --> 02:24:57,098
All thirty of them into IIT?

1982
02:25:42,435 --> 02:25:43,895
Anand?

1983
02:25:47,148 --> 02:25:49,442
You can make it

1984
02:25:56,699 --> 02:26:00,369
Your destiny...

1985
02:26:00,411 --> 02:26:03,456
Is for you to make...

1986
02:26:04,165 --> 02:26:09,462
Be who you strive to be

1987
02:26:11,506 --> 02:26:14,592
Be the Pauper or the Prince.

1988
02:26:15,176 --> 02:26:18,054
The world's on your ally.

1989
02:26:18,721 --> 02:26:22,934
One who can score the highest marks

1990
02:26:25,144 --> 02:26:27,063
The new world order...

1991
02:26:27,146 --> 02:26:28,981
The new world order...

1992
02:26:29,065 --> 02:26:32,109
The new world order...

1993
02:26:32,569 --> 02:26:38,240
Let this be the new order of the world

1994
02:26:39,951 --> 02:26:43,412
The new world order...

1995
02:26:43,705 --> 02:26:47,041
The new world order...

1996
02:26:47,124 --> 02:26:53,881
Let this be the new order of the world

1997
02:27:16,028 --> 02:27:17,446
Anand Sir always said

1998
02:27:19,657 --> 02:27:22,451
creating
geniuses thirty at a time

1999
02:27:24,370 --> 02:27:28,457
but he was changing
lives, thousands at a time.

2000
02:27:30,334 --> 02:27:32,378
Because when a child studies
then the whole family gets a chance,

2001
02:27:34,171 --> 02:27:37,258
everything changes

2002
02:27:37,925 --> 02:27:41,220
and every generation
that follows can go further.

2003
02:27:42,304 --> 02:27:43,514
Forever.

2004
02:27:54,108 --> 02:27:57,654
Be the Pauper or the Prince.

2005
02:27:57,737 --> 02:28:01,032
The world's on your ally.

2006
02:28:01,490 --> 02:28:06,704
One who can score the highest marks

2007
02:28:07,664 --> 02:28:09,498
The new world order...

2008
02:28:09,582 --> 02:28:11,584
The new world order...

2009
02:28:11,668 --> 02:28:15,087
The new world order...

2010
02:28:15,171 --> 02:28:21,177
Let this be the new order of the world

2011
02:28:23,220 --> 02:28:25,932
The new world order...

2012
02:28:26,015 --> 02:28:29,560
The new world order...

2013
02:28:29,686 --> 02:28:35,566
Let this be the new order of the world

2014
02:28:42,198 --> 02:28:45,326
Your destiny...

2015
02:28:45,785 --> 02:28:49,038
Is for you to make...

2016
02:28:49,538 --> 02:28:54,460
Be who you strive to be

2017
02:28:56,879 --> 02:29:00,382
Be the Pauper or the Prince.

2018
02:29:00,466 --> 02:29:03,678
The world's on your ally.

2019
02:29:04,261 --> 02:29:08,808
One who can score the highest marks

2020
02:29:10,601 --> 02:29:14,146
The new world order...

2021
02:29:14,230 --> 02:29:17,900
The new world order...

2022
02:29:17,984 --> 02:29:25,449
Let this be the new order of the world

2023
02:29:30,246 --> 02:29:33,750
Drive away ignorance...

2024
02:29:33,916 --> 02:29:37,044
...with your intelligence..

2025
02:29:37,628 --> 02:29:41,590
Help your dreams break free.

2026
02:29:41,674 --> 02:29:44,969
Help your dreams break free.

2027
02:29:45,052 --> 02:29:48,430
Nature has...

2028
02:29:48,514 --> 02:29:51,976
...given everyone this opportunity...

2029
02:29:52,059 --> 02:29:56,605
To earn your right

2030
02:29:58,482 --> 02:30:00,484
The new world order...

2031
02:30:00,567 --> 02:30:02,361
The new world order...

2032
02:30:02,444 --> 02:30:05,572
The new world order...

2033
02:30:05,823 --> 02:30:12,705
Let this be the new order of the world

2034
02:30:21,505 --> 02:30:27,219
When you've a talent...

2035
02:30:27,636 --> 02:30:34,393
You can swim against the tide of time.

2036
02:30:35,227 --> 02:30:42,443
Like an alchemist...

2037
02:30:42,526 --> 02:30:49,742
You can turn sand into gold

2038
02:30:50,659 --> 02:30:54,205
Caste doesn't matter...

2039
02:30:54,288 --> 02:30:57,541
Nor does creed.

2040
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:03,672
Let you be known for your work

2041
02:31:06,217 --> 02:31:09,720
That is the tradition

2042
02:31:09,804 --> 02:31:13,474
Eradicate...

2043
02:31:13,640 --> 02:31:19,063
All the differences...

2044
02:31:20,647 --> 02:31:24,651
Be the Pauper or the Prince.

2045
02:31:24,693 --> 02:31:28,114
The world's on your ally.

2046
02:31:28,447 --> 02:31:32,994
