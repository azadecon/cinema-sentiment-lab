00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500


2
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,583
"Like buds we are, naive kids."

3
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,708
"Naughty we got, when knickers kicked in."

4
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,708
"Of same colour, our knickers are."

5
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:20,708
"Man, my buddy you are."

6
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,125
"Like buds we are, naive kids."

7
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,250
"Naughty we got, when knickers kicked in."

8
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,208
"Of same colour, our knickers are."

9
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,458
"Man, my buddy you are."

10
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,500
"Up on the shoulders, into the ears.."

11
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,625
"In by-lanes and closed stores.."

12
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,625
"We took a leak as we pleased."

13
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:41,625
"Toilets are something never we leased."

14
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,041
"Up on the shoulders, into the ears.."

15
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,083
"In by-lanes and closed stores.."

16
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,166
"We took a leak as we pleased."

17
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:54,291
"Shooed we were by the people displeased."

18
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,416
"Shoes you are, I am your lace."

19
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,500
"My broken buttons, you stitch."

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,625
"Shoes you are, I am your lace."

21
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,666
"Drunk I get, when you drink."

22
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,750
"Shoes you are, I am your lace."

23
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,875
"Man, what is this that you have done!"

24
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,916
"Shoes you are, I am your lace."

25
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:14,791
"Chaos is when this world laughs."

26
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:19,333
"As we came of age, we started chasing girls..."

27
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:23,583
"Now we use oil, little is the gel left in the hair.."

28
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:27,708
"The thrashing we got from our parents ruined our picture.."

29
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:36,041
"Now we look like riddles, people try to diddle us."

30
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:40,166
"Shoes you are, I am your lace."

31
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:44,166
"Shoes you are, I am your lace."

32
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:53,041
Tomatoes, radish, round gourd.

33
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,000
A new cover for the fridge.

34
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,875
'Aunt Richa taunts, I'm the female in my family.'

35
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,333
'I care a damn.'

36
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,375
'I'm a better cook than her.'

37
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,666
'I can boost, I am better than most.'

38
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,750
'Last Holi, I made ladyfinger chips.'

39
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,375
'Everyone in the vicinity still remembers its taste.'

40
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,375
'It's my childhood dream..'

41
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,416
'That I own a restaurant.'

42
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:25,416
'The one that belongs to me.'

43
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,250
'Somewhere in near future.'

44
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,875
'But there's still time for that.'

45
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,500
'First I need to clear high school.'

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,791
'Do you always end up denting your car?'

47
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,291
'Do you keep getting demoted at work?'

48
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,333
'Does your wife cheat on you?'

49
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,916
'Do you keep flunking your exams? No problem.'

50
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,750
'Seek our sage's blessings. Hot and fresh.'

51
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,583
'A blessing as hot and fresh as a home-cooked meal.'

52
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:52,583
'And now watch, The Food Treasure.'

53
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,125
Kuku.. - Yes, papa?

54
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,041
When are you getting your results?

55
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,041
It will take another day or two. - Why?

56
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,041
Papers are getting checked in Chennai.

57
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,458
Chennai!

58
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:33,458
They are hard markers.

59
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,250
But mom, I had prepared so well for them.

60
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,083
It's hard marking.

61
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,458
That's why you scored such marks.

62
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,208
Then everyone must've scored similarly.

63
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,250
Of course! Will I lie to you?

64
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,625
Come with me. Stop crying and drink some water. Come on.

65
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,333
Here, Rs. 20.

66
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,583
Rs. 20? It's Rs. 40. - How?

67
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:54,666
You have two kids.

68
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,541
So? - So, can't you read?

69
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,958
Public student, Rs. 20. Government student, Rs. 10.

70
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,875
Free for failures.

71
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,041
So, one of my sons failed.

72
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,041
Failed? How? How much did he score? - 85.

73
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,250
And this one? - 37.

74
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,875
F-37 means passed.

75
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,166
For me 37 means failed.

76
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,750
How? Give me Rs. 20. - He has failed.

77
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:12,958
What are you staring at? Let's go.

78
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,500
Give me Rs. 20! - He has failed! Let's go!

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,416
Loser! He'll always be a failure! Nonsense!

80
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,666
Leave your footwear outside! The carpet's new!

81
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,541
Can't you see! You are just barging inside!

82
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:27,291
We've taken them off.

83
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,458
We're here to check the results.

84
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:30,666
Did you check out the queue?

85
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,250
Can't we skip the queue?

86
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,625
"Can't we skip the queue?!"

87
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,291
"You think you are entering your own wedding?"

88
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:42,041
'This man can sell sand to desert dweller and ice to an Eskimo."

89
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:46,333
He is my best friend. His name is Ronnie Gulati.

90
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:50,625
Yogesh, Kuku.. - So?

91
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,458
He doesn't have a mother.

92
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:56,166
He's a motherless child. What are you saying?

93
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,041
He is always worried.

94
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,375
This poor soul does all the household chores.

95
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,416
He cooks for his younger sister. He looks after her.

96
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:04,916
Do you want him to wait in the queue?

97
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,083
Shouldn't he rather go take care of his house?

98
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,583
Think before you speak.

99
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,833
Okay. Fine. - Show the results.

100
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:10,916
Come with me, Kuku.

101
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,875
Move. What's this commotion? - Come with me.

102
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,583
Move. It's so hot..

103
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,958
Sit on his lap, and he'll show the results.

104
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,125
Move aside, Raju.

105
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,666
Excuse me. Yogesh..

106
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,458
Please move back a little.

107
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,750
So, public or government? - Public.

108
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,500
Okay. Number?

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,166
15,419 dollar. - Dollar?

110
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,041
Helps remember the number.

111
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,500
Okay. And yours?

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,166
Add one.

113
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,666
15420?

114
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,666
15420.

115
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:40,958
"Grandpa's Grandson!"

116
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,166
You always seek sympathy over my dead mother.

117
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,625
It gets the job done.

118
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:51,083
Here you go..

119
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,208
89!

120
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,166
90!

121
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,083
89! - 89!

122
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,291
So? - 90!

123
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,625
Let's go! Party time!

124
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,125
Pay up! - Let's go! 90!

125
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,083
89! - 90!

126
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,000
Party!

127
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,041
90!

128
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,458
90%!

129
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,625
90%!

130
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:18,708
90%!

131
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,416
Kuku got 90%...!

132
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:24,416
Papers must've leaked!

133
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:30,708
'I've been getting tutored by Seema since the last 7 years.'

134
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,291
'But the real reason is Mitali.'

135
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,875
'She stays across the street.'

136
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,375
'I'm 5.10".'

137
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,208
'And she's 5.9".'

138
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,166
'Our heights match, Ronnie says.'

139
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,500
Mitali. - Yes mom.

140
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,541
'Mitali's mom, Malti.'

141
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,625
'They are well-known in our vicinity.'

142
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,875
'People gossip about them.'

143
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,958
'They take a lot of lifts.'

144
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,750
'But only from big shots.'

145
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,250
'But that's not true.'

146
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,041
'It's all rubbish!'

147
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,250
'One day, I too will give her a lift.'

148
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,583
'And I know..'

149
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:09,583
'Mitali won't refuse it.'

150
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,083
What are you doing? Let's go.

151
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,083
Nothing. Let's go.

152
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,583
My cousin too has it. In that he runs like this.

153
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,625
Where's the community centre?

154
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,000
The community centre? - We are new here. We don't know.

155
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,625
What..? - Grandpa says, first rule in business

156
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,958
Never waste time on something that won't give any return.

157
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,125
Let's go.

158
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,791
This is a shoe.

159
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,166
Now tell me what is this? - Sole.

160
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,541
Not a sole. Ordinary shoes have sole.

161
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:39,916
This contains a shocker.

162
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:43,291
Big cars have shocker, so that they don't get shock.

163
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,541
So that their outer beauty remains intact.

164
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,333
That's why this too contains a shocker.

165
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,791
So this shoe can never get damaged.

166
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,083
So, should I prepare the bill?

167
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,458
Let me tell you something special about it.

168
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,583
Its' design too is amazing.

169
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:56,750
Superb!

170
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,041
The air flows in from here and flows out from here itself!

171
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,208
Cross-ventilation. - Exactly!

172
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,416
Check it out!

173
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,166
Uncle, isn't the tick the other way around?

174
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,458
You are look at it in the wrong way. Here, now it is straight.

175
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,416
When you walk wearing this, it will be straight. Right?

176
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,625
Just like an aeroplane.

177
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,458
Great! Let me see.

178
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,166
Are they original?

179
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,250
Tony! - No! He's joking!

180
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,458
What kind of a joke is this?!

181
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,250
You mean, I've a warehouse full of shoes..

182
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,708
And I keep stamping shoes with Nicky logos and selling them stealthily?

183
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,041
No, uncle. Sorry, uncle. - He was joking.

184
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,166
He doesn't know. - It's okay.

185
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,458
How much does it cost?

186
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,166
Rs. 1550, only for you.

187
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,333
How much will you sell it for? - 1550.

188
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,916
Discount?

189
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,541
One rupee. 1549..

190
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,166
So, should I prepare the bill?

191
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,000
Should I buy them? - Buy them.

192
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,625
Prepare the bill. - Wonderful.

193
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,875
God bless you. Tony! - Yes.

194
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,125
There's a Tony here and a Tony there as well.

195
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,875
I'm not talking to you.

196
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,291
You've started lying a lot.

197
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,416
Why did I lie to you?

198
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,958
Don't you work in a sari shop?

199
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,333
Yes. So what?

200
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:09,625
It's been months..

201
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,208
You didn't send a sari for me.

202
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,916
I'll send you one soon. - Yeah, right.

203
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,000
Hey, you speak as if I've never sent you anything.

204
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
What did you send? Tell me.

205
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,083
Don't you remember the mobile phone? Didn't I send it to you?

206
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,791
That mobile phone? It's useless. - Why?

207
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,166
Your mother.. - What happened to her?

208
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,083
Nothing's wrong with her.

209
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:33,833
Your mother keeps playing games on it.

210
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,208
She doesn't let me have it.

211
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,916
I'm calling you from a STD booth.

212
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,166
You've not done anything for me. You haven't sent anything for me.

213
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,708
You don't even enquire about my wellbeing.

214
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,583
It won't make any difference to you if I die.

215
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:49,583
Don't worry. I'll send something for you.

216
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,875
Who is it? - My friends.

217
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,250
Hang up. I'll call you later.

218
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,000
You have time for your friends, but not for me.

219
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,916
How are you Suresh? - Why did you marry me? Tell me.

220
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,458
It's been six months since I last saw you.

221
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,166
Why do you say so? - Why did you marry me?

222
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,458
Listen.. - You don't have time for me.

223
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,208
'Ronnie's grandpa has a Sari Shop in Geeta colony.'

224
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,208
'All the stock lies in the warehouse.'

225
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,375
'And it is delivered to the shop as and when required.'

226
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,041
'But for us, it's our joint.'

227
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,958
'We enjoy our booze here.'

228
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,750
'By booze, I mean fruit beer.'

229
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,791
'A fake beer. But it gives a feeling of being sloshed.'

230
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:30,333
I'll ask dad to buy me a second-hand bike.

231
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,375
A bike, why?

232
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,375
I saw Mitali today.

233
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,666
I see her everyday. What's new?

234
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,875
I've been going around with her since ages. Got it?

235
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,750
You've been going around on foot where as she is racing ahead..

236
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,333
On bikes with boys.

237
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,708
Dogs! - True!

238
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,666
I'll get them for you.

239
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:53,125
He's talking to his wife. - Don't worry.

240
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,625
He is blushing.

241
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,541
True love. - Why would I lie to you?

242
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,791
Bottoms up?

243
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,791
Bottoms up!

244
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,250
"I'm sloshed. I'm sloshed. I'm sloshed."

245
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,041
I'm sloshed.

246
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,833
I'm sloshed. Fruit beer gave me a high, man!

247
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,791
"Kuku!"

248
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,541
90%..

249
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,250
You got a gold medal in Olympics.

250
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,583
90% in physical education.

251
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,000
You choose this as the fifth subject without my permission.

252
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,708
Are NASA guys into bodybuilding these days?

253
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,125
Do scientists exercise?

254
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:40,166
What about the other subjects?

255
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:41,958
Maths..

256
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,291
44..

257
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,416
And English?

258
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,500
Papa, no matter the subject.

259
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,125
This is the first time he scored 90%.

260
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:54,416
It's not like he got 'Compartment' in the others subjects, like always.

261
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:59,458
Papa, we deserve a treat.

262
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,166
Fine.

263
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:06,125
Make cottage cheese for dinner.

264
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,291
Here.

265
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,125
Manage everything with this.

266
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,708
And this.. - Thank you, papa.

267
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,291
"Kuku!"

268
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,416
This is for the college form.

269
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,000
Go to the college tomorrow and fill up a form.

270
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,666
Oh yes, do you have a passport size photograph?

271
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,125
Yes, I have it.

272
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,291
Fine. Go.

273
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:33,291
Now go.

274
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,125
Damn..

275
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,666
They have impinged the whole street.

276
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,666
Do you bloody own the street!

277
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:01,458
I rolled down my car's window and said..

278
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,833
"Apologize!"

279
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,375
Hello. - Hi.

280
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,416
Desraj, isn't this the safari suit..

281
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,791
..that you wore for Pintoo's tonsuring ceremony?

282
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:20,083
It's been 12 years, but it still looks the same.

283
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,958
Father has a sharp eye..

284
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,666
Anything he sees gets imprinted in his brains.

285
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:30,125
Forever. - All cheer for Desraj!

286
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:34,166
I'll blow this bomb on the DJ's head! It'll blow up like bang!

287
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,833
It'll blow up like boom!

288
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,708
Bang! - Boom!

289
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,041
Bang! - Grandpa!

290
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,625
Babloo and Pintoo plan to blow a bomb on the DJ's head.

291
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,291
Hemanshu!

292
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:46,750
Yes, grandpa!

293
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,625
What's going on out there? Go and find out.

294
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,041
Okay Fix it.

295
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:54,291
Bye. I'll call you back.

296
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,291
Excuse me. Babloo. Pintoo.

297
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:00,291
What are you doing? Move aside.

298
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,458
There goes the bomb.

299
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,666
The party is on! It's on!

300
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,666
There goes your bomb!

301
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,875
You are not eating anything. This is not right.

302
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,583
Ronnie?

303
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,000
Kuku! I was just about to call you.

304
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,583
What's all this? - Even I didn't know.

305
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,041
Everyone gave me a surprise when I got home.

306
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,666
All of a sudden.. Grandpa.. - What are you wearing?

307
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,958
Don't make fun of it! Grandpa got it for me.

308
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,833
Don't I look dashing in it? Fits perfectly, doesn't it, Chota?

309
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,041
I'm looking handsome, aren't I?

310
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,000
It fits you well. - I know, man.

311
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,416
What's happening? - Yeah. It's a party.

312
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,875
Grandpa has invited freeloaders. He's offering them free cold drinks.

313
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,916
It's nothing. Don't worry. We..

314
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:51,958
Why are you eavesdropping?

315
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,625
Go and meet Suchi. - Go.

316
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,291
We'll have our party at the warehouse.

317
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,208
We'll drink our brand.. Wait..

318
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:03,833
Our brand.. Here's 100 bucks. Buy two.. - This..

319
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,000
We'll have fun on Sunday. A party at the warehouse.

320
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,750
Just a second! They won't let me live. Coming!

321
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,875
Go.. - Wait. I'll be back in 10 minutes.

322
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,666
Have dinner before you leave. Don't just leave. Okay?

323
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,708
And don't forget to buy our brand's.. Just a second!

324
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:19,416
Coming, uncle. Why don't you just kill Ronnie today!

325
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,541
Hello, auntie. Hi. How are you?

326
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,208
How are you, Kuku? - I'm fine. Everything's great.

327
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:25,708
My baby..

328
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,041
Auntie, Ronnie.. - Where's your father?

329
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,333
He.. - I cannot find him.

330
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,375
Did you have dinner? - Yes, well..

331
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,166
It's okay. I'll pack some cottage cheese and flatbread.

332
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,625
Okay. - Eat and give some to your father.

333
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,125
Okay? - Who is he?

334
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,000
Ronnie's friend. - Hello, auntie.

335
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,708
They don't have a mother.

336
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,875
No, it's okay. You are just like my kids.

337
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,000
Right, Chota?

338
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,125
My son..

339
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,375
Come give me a hug.

340
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:51,666
Switch it on.

341
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,333
Hey, they have made the announcement.

342
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,250
Let's go. Let's go, son.

343
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,208
Come with me. Look at this!

344
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:03,208
'Ronnie Matching Centre.'

345
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,250
Ronnie's settled for life.

346
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,708
Not yet. - Why?

347
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,166
They have just inaugurated the shop.

348
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,625
People need to buy, they need to sell, make profit..

349
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,291
Only then will the shop run smoothly.

350
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,791
Who knows whether it will? - How can it not?

351
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,166
Grandpa's 60-year-old sari shop is right next to it.

352
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,291
People, females who go there to buy saris..

353
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,125
Will they leave without buying blouse and petticoat?

354
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:42,750
Point. - God bless you son.

355
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,750
Surprised? His life is set.

356
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,791
'Kuku and Ronnie. Ronnie and Kuku.'

357
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,208
'What's in a name? Both of them are same-same.'

358
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,791
'But after they grew up, everything has changed.'

359
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,291
Excuse me.. - Yes?

360
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,333
Photo.. Kuku Mathur.

361
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:21,916
Yeah. Just a minute.

362
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:26,041
Here, your photos.

363
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:30,083
Listen.. Your friend, Ronnie, I have his photo with me.

364
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:34,083
Please give it to him.

365
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,833
'Now the confusion was clearing.'

366
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,833
'Not even 20 Kukus could match-up to a single Ronnie.'

367
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:04,958
Water! Water! Water!

368
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,916
Water! Water!

369
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,291
You want to submit your form?

370
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:14,291
You want a form?

371
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,041
Why are you standing in a queue?

372
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:24,041
Take it from me.

373
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,750
Water! Water! Water!

374
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,208
Sir! What's this? My form?

375
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,958
We're closing for the day!

376
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,625
Again?

377
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:40,875
Excuse me..

378
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,375
The counter closed.. - 100 bucks.

379
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:49,083
With such marks forget about the state college.

380
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,333
Go for physical education. It will be done.

381
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,791
Done.

382
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,750
Booze!

383
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,083
Ronnie...? - He's not here.

384
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,416
Where is he? - He didn't tell me.

385
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,333
Hey..

386
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:10,333
What have you got?

387
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,375
Yes, Kuku? - Where are you?

388
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,416
Where are you? - At the warehouse.

389
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:20,625
You had promised. It's Sunday.

390
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,041
Today is Sunday? - Yes.

391
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,875
I keep my shop closed on Mondays.

392
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,458
We will meet on Monday. You do your own thing.

393
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,000
But you promised..

394
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,541
What "you promised, you promised!

395
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,083
I told you, I am working. Don't you understand?

396
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:35,375
I'm not sitting idle like you.

397
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:40,166
You keep calling me after every two minutes!

398
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,541
Sir..

399
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,416
Why are you leaving?

400
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,750
Drink with me.

401
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,041
You got the booze, I'll get the glasses.

402
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:52,041
No, I have some work. - What?

403
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:01,333
"Kuku!"

404
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,250
Ronnie is now a businessman.

405
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,458
Now, what are your plans?

406
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,166
"Kuku!"

407
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,791
College.

408
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,958
Education.. For another 2-4 years.

409
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,708
Then a job.

410
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,791
Just like your father.

411
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:30,000
Life completely changes.

412
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,333
One doesn't get government jobs these days.

413
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,333
Go for a private company.

414
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:36,833
Like me.

415
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,000
"Kuku!"

416
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,458
Hey, Kuku..

417
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,125
Now you too are one of us!

418
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:47,833
Welcome.

419
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,916
Have you lost your mind? - Why?

420
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,125
What are you saying! Get lost.

421
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:54,625
I don't want to drink with you.

422
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:58,625
What did I say? - Get lost!

423
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:10,125
Come on, everyone. Get in a line.

424
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:13,666
Do you want an invitation? Get in a line!

425
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:16,291
Six in each line. Make three lines.

426
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:19,416
You need to run from this pole to that tree.

427
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:23,500
Okay? You will start running when I blow the whistle.

428
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,958
Hello, ma'am. Welcome. - Hi.

429
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,458
Why are you looking over there? Concentrate on your run.

430
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,541
Get in the line.

431
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:35,083
Come on, get in the line!

432
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,375
Take your positions.

433
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:41,125
Get..

434
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:44,208
Set..

435
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:48,208
And go!

436
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:56,541
What are you doing?

437
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:57,916
What are you looking at?

438
00:23:58,416 --> 00:23:59,791
Sir, the sole came off.

439
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:03,625
Complete the race.

440
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:07,625
Useless!

441
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,708
Kuku Mathur, Chaar Minar. - Sir..

442
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,208
You are here for admission? - Sir, he stepped on my shoes..

443
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,125
I don't want arguments. Just answer my question.

444
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:22,916
You won't get admission. Scram.

445
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:24,625
I'll get it if you want me to.

446
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,125
What will you get? Have you seen your face in the mirror?

447
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:27,541
You look awful.

448
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,000
You want admission.

449
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,083
Heed my advice, always leave your house with a coin in your pocket.

450
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,041
Why? - Strong winds keep blowing.

451
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:35,916
You might fly away.

452
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:37,166
Sir..

453
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:38,875
He wants admission. Scram!

454
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:42,791
Sir.. - I told you to leave.

455
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:46,458
I wonder what they think before coming here.

456
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:47,833
Mr. Sharma.. - Yes?

457
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:51,208
Who's next?

458
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:54,250
Water! Water! Water!

459
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,041
Water!

460
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:58,333
Okay. Water! Water!

461
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:02,625
Water! Have a glass.

462
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,250
What happened?

463
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,166
Nothing. - Tell me.

464
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:10,625
You didn't get selected?

465
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:13,458
Then take up a job.

466
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:16,916
Why are you sulking because you didn't get a selected?

467
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:22,125
Will you do a job? A job?

468
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:26,125
500 bucks.

469
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:32,000
It's just 500 bucks. I'm getting you a job.

470
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,583
You'll have to go to Noida.

471
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:35,916
Think over it.

472
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:38,708
Scene 15, Take 2.

473
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:40,458
Silence.

474
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,333
Mood.

475
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,750
Feel that your friend has ruined you.

476
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,333
I'll narrate from here and you'll read from there.

477
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:51,166
Camera! Action!

478
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:54,125
Ajit! My friend.. - Hold it higher.

479
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:56,791
You betrayed me.

480
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:59,625
You pretended to be my friend.

481
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:04,000
And behind my back you had an affair with my wife!

482
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,666
One friend ruined another friend's life!

483
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,291
You pretended to be my friend.

484
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:11,375
I'll kill you!

485
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,625
Hold it properly! -If there is no troublemaker..

486
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:15,666
..there shall be no trouble.

487
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:18,416
Dolly! Wake up, Dolly!

488
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:22,708
What is it? - I need to test your fidelity.

489
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,791
Ajit was my friend. - Hold it properly.

490
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:27,750
But now he will have to die..

491
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:32,083
Because of you.

492
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:36,083
But.. - And if you refuse, I shall kill you as well.

493
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:39,375
No, Amit! Don't do that, Amit! Don't say that, Amit!

494
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:44,000
You've been unfaithful to me. I shall never forgive you.

495
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,875
No, Amit. It's not so!

496
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:49,875
Hold it like this! Like this!

497
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:52,458
Action!

498
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:56,291
Take 48.

499
00:26:56,791 --> 00:27:00,291
"Hey girl..!"

500
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,833
"Hey girl, switch on your computer!"

501
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:10,583
"Catch me on internet."

502
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:14,000
"There are thousands of likes on my photo."

503
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,416
"On Facebook, love me!"

504
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:22,208
"Come on, add me!"

505
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:26,125
"Log on, girl! Tag me!"

506
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:29,375
"I have a thousand friend requests pending!"

507
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:32,916
"Back off!" - "On Facebook, love me!"

508
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:36,333
"Come on, add me!"

509
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:39,750
"On Facebook, love me!"

510
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:43,625
"Come on, add me!"

511
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:48,125
"Hey girl...!"

512
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,125
Kuku, leave that. Get water for me.

513
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:52,458
Do it properly.

514
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:56,250
Go!

515
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,000
"Hey boy!"

516
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,458
"Back off!"

517
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:03,000
"I feel like sharing the galaxy with you."

518
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,791
"I think I should do it before it's too late."

519
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:10,000
"Oh Bubbly, I love you." "By God."

520
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,333
"I should download you in my dreams."

521
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:16,833
"I should make you my friend."

522
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:20,500
"We will make history here."

523
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,958
"My love shall never shut down."

524
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:25,958
"My love, please say yes."

525
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:27,708
"Don't back out!"

526
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:31,125
"Our worlds shall unite!"

527
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:34,666
"On Facebook.. - Love me!"

528
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:38,208
"Come on.. - Add me!"

529
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:41,000
What are you looking at? Go and do your job. Go, hold the styrofoam.

530
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,291
"I've added you."

531
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:44,000
"So what do you think?"

532
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,666
"I've added you."

533
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:47,083
"I love you."

534
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:49,375
Hold it properly! What are you doing? Sit down!

535
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:52,333
"Okay. Thank you!

536
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:54,083
Keep it down! What are you doing?

537
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,625
Don't you know how to do this? What are you doing?

538
00:28:57,125 --> 00:29:00,625
You told me to sit down. - I told you! Shut up!

539
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:07,625
"Hey girl!"

540
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:09,916
Very good. - Nice take, I think.

541
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,416
Very good, madam. Excellent.

542
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,500
What are you doing? Can't you hold it properly?

543
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,791
Very good, boys. - Come with me. - Kuku, get an umbrella for me.

544
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:17,208
What are you doing? Go!

545
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:19,708
Where are you going! - I wonder where they come from!

546
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:21,791
Hurry up! - A burden on earth.

547
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:24,458
Mr. Sharma, look at this poster. I have printed 1 lakh posters.

548
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:26,250
What is this? - Have a look.

549
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,833
The hero's photo is larger, like always.

550
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,500
If CDs don't sell like hot cakes then tell me!

551
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,875
Half yours and half mine. It's the same. - Shut up.

552
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:35,208
Rosy ma'am, tea. Thank you.

553
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:37,583
How is it? - Nice.

554
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:39,000
What is this?

555
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,416
Don't you know how to make tea?

556
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:42,416
How much sugar have you added?

557
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:44,875
One and Half.spoons, as instructed. - One and One forth.

558
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,458
I have One and One forth spoons of sugar in my tea, not One and Half.

559
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:49,041
Didn't you think it's necessary to ask me?

560
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:54,166
One and Half... a little less than One and Half and a little more than one. One and One forth. Got it?

561
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:56,875
But I was told One and Half.. - Stop your nonsense.

562
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,458
Apologise. Apologise to her.

563
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:01,291
Apologise. There's no harm in that.

564
00:30:01,791 --> 00:30:03,541
Do you need an invitation to apologise?

565
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:06,666
Sorry. - What "Sorry"! Get lost!

566
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:09,333
And listen, clean my Scooty. I need to leave.

567
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:14,041
Scooty? - Do as she said. Get going. Go.

568
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:16,958
Do it. It's just a Scooty. Go.

569
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:18,708
Go. Get going.

570
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,375
Scram. Leave. Go.

571
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:22,750
What's going on? Is this a joke?

572
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,291
What kind of people have you kept?

573
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:25,416
I kept him on Mr. Sharma's recommendation.

574
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:27,166
I don't like him. - Tell me something..

575
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:30,375
First of all, you place some hearts near my photo.

576
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:32,583
Highlight my photo if you are increasing its size.

577
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,416
Baby, we will have big hoardings of you during the release.

578
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,125
Big ones. - I have seen your hoardings.

579
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:37,625
My photo should shine.

580
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,916
The hero will shine. - Stop it.

581
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:41,458
Movies don't sell because of the hero.

582
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:45,458
The heroine should be visible.

583
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:56,083
They have turned me into a laundry boy.

584
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,833
Mr. Sharma..

585
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:16,458
We'll shoot the next scene in a desert.

586
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,375
The scene goes like this..

587
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:24,208
From a distance we can see our hero coming, riding a horse..

588
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:25,541
Kuku. - Yes sir.

589
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:27,708
Come with me.

590
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:30,708
Write whatever I am saying.

591
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:34,250
Our hero is coming, riding a horse..

592
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,208
On his left hand he is holding the horse's rein..

593
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:38,291
..and on his right, a tambourine.

594
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:43,791
Mr. Sharma, the same tambourine which Rishi Kapoor used?

595
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:46,041
The same tambourine. Write same tambourine.

596
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:51,291
Now, in this shot I reveal the heroine..

597
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:56,083
And the heroine turns, in high speed.

598
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:59,125
And right then, strong winds start blowing..

599
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:03,333
And our hero who is on a horse, his long hair blows in the wind.

600
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:06,250
Sir, the hero doesn't have long hair.

601
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,833
If they aren't long then ask him to make them long by tomorrow.

602
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:12,208
This is not fair. Do one thing..

603
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:15,833
Call for a curly hair wig. He has an option between that or this.

604
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:18,458
I won't compromise with my shot.

605
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:19,833
Understood? - Yes, sir.

606
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:24,791
Our hero jumps off the camel..

607
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:26,458
But wasn't the hero was on a horse, sir?

608
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:31,583
So what? Option. Camel's option, horse.

609
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:36,041
And as soon as the tambourine plays, it starts lightening in the desert.

610
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:37,708
And it starts raining.

611
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:39,750
Sir, it doesn't rain in desert.

612
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,625
But the winds can blow. A windstorm can come. Write it down!

613
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:45,291
Five helicopter fans. Note it down.

614
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:48,625
Winds will blow, windstorm will come. Whatever we want will happen.

615
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:52,291
Go, follow him. Hurry up and give this list to him. - Sir..

616
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:56,291
Just a minute, sir. Sir..

617
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,333
Who is it?

618
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:06,458
Tea. - Yes, keep it here.

619
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:09,916
Thank you.

620
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:11,291
Kuku..

621
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:13,041
"Kuku!"

622
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:14,458
How much sugar did you add today?

623
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:16,250
One and One forth spoons. - One and One forth?

624
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,458
Yes. - Then why are you so scared?

625
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,375
I don't bite.

626
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:25,083
No, last time you made clean your Scooty because of the sugar. - Yes..

627
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:26,791
So this time, thinking about what you might make me do..

628
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:29,458
I added One and One forth spoons of sugar.

629
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:31,708
So cute, Kuku.

630
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:35,041
You will clean the Scooty today as well.

631
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:36,333
You will, won't you?

632
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:40,500
Look, don't think that I am like other snobbish heroines.

633
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,166
I am surrounded by selfish people.

634
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:46,416
I am supposed to do it.

635
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:49,583
I cannot be polite to anyone During the first meeting.

636
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:51,458
After all it's the question of Rosy's image.

637
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:53,708
Anyway, now say happy birthday.

638
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:55,958
Happy birthday. - Thank you, Kuku.

639
00:33:56,458 --> 00:34:00,000
Now tell me, what will you do for me?

640
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,875
Shall we go shopping?

641
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,000
Clean the Scooty then we will go.

642
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,000
Okay?

643
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,666
Listen, what's your plan for tonight?

644
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:26,250
Tonight? Nothing.

645
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,625
Then listen, I need a Favour from you. - What favour?

646
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,125
I promised my best friend..

647
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:34,041
..that we both will go on a double date on my birthday.

648
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:38,333
I know it is senseless, but she is my best friend.

649
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:42,250
Rosy, what's a double date?

650
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,791
Kuku, you don't know what a double date is?

651
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,916
You are so cute!

652
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:50,000
Double date. Two couples on a date.

653
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,291
She'll come with her boyfriend and I'll come with mine.

654
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,000
Then, go.

655
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,250
With whom?

656
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,708
Last night I had a break-up with my businessman boyfriend.

657
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:02,041
Oh shit. How?

658
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:04,125
He didn't call at midnight to wish me.

659
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:05,625
Can you imagine! - Very bad.

660
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:07,333
I kept waiting for his phone call.

661
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:08,958
So many people called me, I didn't attend any calls.

662
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,625
Not even my parents'.

663
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:12,291
I kept waiting for his phone call.

664
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:14,541
I think I waited for 20 minutes.

665
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:17,583
Finally, I got irritated and called him up at 12 20am..

666
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,666
Can you imagine, that scoundrel was busy on another call!

667
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,750
My call was kept on waiting.

668
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:25,166
So cheap. Shameless.

669
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:26,916
You deserve better. You'll find someone better.

670
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,041
Then I will when I will. But what should I do today?

671
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:33,250
I cannot ditch my best Friend at the last moment.

672
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,375
She will think that I am avoiding giving her a treat.

673
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:36,875
So now what?

674
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:40,875
Please, Kuku, please come with me as my businessman boyfriend?

675
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:43,041
Please. Just for today. - No. I cannot.

676
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,958
We will go for dinner. You will be my businessman boyfriend. - No.

677
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:48,166
Anyway, look at you. You are so handsome.

678
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:49,583
You look like a businessman.

679
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:51,041
She won't doubt it even for a moment.

680
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:53,625
She knows all my other friends.

681
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:55,708
Please come with me. Everything will be fine. I promise.

682
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:59,083
We'll lie. We'll say that you have a textile business.

683
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:03,000
We will say that and leave. Okay?

684
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,250
No, restaurant. We'll say that I own a restaurant.

685
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,291
Okay? - You can say restaurant.

686
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,083
It's not like saying so will make you own one.

687
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:10,666
You'll come with me, right? - Yes. Okay.

688
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:11,791
Pack this.

689
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:13,583
I'm taking this. My birthday gift. - How much is it worth?

690
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:17,375
Hey come on, buy it for me.

691
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,833
Come on, Kuku. Nothing can go wrong. I am with you.

692
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:23,583
Just be confident.

693
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:26,916
There they are. Hi!

694
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:29,458
Mitali!

695
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:33,250
It's my birthday!

696
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,625
Hi!

697
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:38,833
Thank you.

698
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:43,541
'I spent 7 years in the same tuition centre..'

699
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:46,625
'..because she used to stay across it.'

700
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:51,416
'Today, finally, I was in front of her, face to face.'

701
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:55,333
'But as her best friend's boyfriend.'

702
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:59,958
'That too for just one night.'

703
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:03,500
I'm so happy.

704
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,291
'Kuku Mathur, this was biggest hoodwink of your life.'

705
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:09,750
'This is what I thought.'

706
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,041
Kuku, you know, Mitali and I are 2 30am friends.

707
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:16,166
Every night we talk at 2 30am.

708
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:18,041
I think we haven't missed a single day.

709
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:20,916
Too much. Kuku is into restaurant business.

710
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:26,000
It serves delicious food. Tell her.

711
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,083
And look at this. He bought it for me today. My birthday gift.

712
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:30,083
A heart-shaped ring. - Happy birthday, everyone.

713
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:31,333
Finally.

714
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,333
Pinkie, a pink cake especially for you.

715
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:36,833
Happy birthday. Happy birthday. - So sweet. Thank you.

716
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:39,458
Mitali, I swear you look like the titanic heroine.

717
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:40,958
Stop that, you meet her everyday.

718
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:42,875
Meet him. My boyfriend. Kuku.

719
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:46,083
I was just telling Mitali. He has a nice restaurant.

720
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:48,458
We will all go there together some day.

721
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:50,000
Kuku..

722
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,833
Restaurant...?

723
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,625
You know Kuku?

724
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:56,541
Mitali, Pinkie plays innocence well.

725
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,708
Either he is fooling her or she is making a fool of both of us. - What..?

726
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:01,166
Anyway, that is your personal matter.

727
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:03,750
Let me tell you, he is a pauper.

728
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,416
He was in my brother Ronnie's class.

729
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:08,791
They just cleared high school. He is a cheapskate.

730
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:10,916
He stealthily drinks fruit beer with my brother's money.

731
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:12,833
What...? - And a restaurant business?

732
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,000
Restaurant.. He doesn't know the B of business.

733
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,708
His father works at L.T.C. He stays in a flat.

734
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:21,041
'This wasn't a double date, it was double trouble.'

735
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:23,208
'I had such a punch line brewing inside..'

736
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:25,541
'..that it would have stunned all three of them.'

737
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:27,166
'But it never surfaced.'

738
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:29,958
Kuku, you are taking things too far now.

739
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:32,375
I'll slap you for lying to the girls here.

740
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:33,458
Get lost from here.

741
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:35,458
He sometimes borrows my brother's clothes.

742
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:37,458
Whose t-shirt is it? - Mine.

743
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:42,583
Get lost. - Kuku is that true?

744
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:45,041
He's such a liar.

745
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:48,041
Mitali, he lied on my birthday. - It's okay.

746
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:49,333
It's been going on for three months.

747
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:50,958
We'll cut your cake. Get a knife. - Forget about the cake.

748
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:52,416
Let the cake go to hell. I'm not in the mood.

749
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:54,666
It's okay. - He betrayed me.

750
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,875
Does he pay for my booze?

751
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:59,666
Mitali too is one of them! "I don't know the B of business."

752
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:03,666
Here's your booze. I don't want it.

753
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,416
Grandpa, that's 110.

754
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:10,625
What are you saying? It was 110 yesterday.

755
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,958
I just counted. It's 115.

756
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:15,458
I drink! Damn! Everything belongs to them.

757
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:16,625
Mitali is his girlfriend.

758
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:18,541
I told you, the difference between yellow and blue..

759
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:21,458
Sonu, what's Ronnie's friend doing here so late in the night?

760
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:24,583
Where's Ronnie? - Not here.

761
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:25,791
Damn..

762
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:29,833
I had told you. You can't see properly. You don't understand!

763
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:31,583
Let it be. It's not my fault.

764
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,083
Hey! Come here!

765
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:36,833
Come in.

766
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:41,541
Yes, grandpa? - What work do you have with Ronnie so late in the night?

767
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:44,458
It's nothing, grandpa. I needed to return something to him.

768
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:46,416
Ronnie has gone to distribute calendars.

769
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:52,416
Give it to me. I'll give it to him. - No, it's okay. I'll return it to him.

770
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:55,666
What's in it? - Nothing.

771
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:57,791
Beer. It's beer.

772
00:39:58,291 --> 00:39:59,583
No, it's not beer. It's fruit beer.

773
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:00,958
Check the bags. Come on, we'll just find out..

774
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:04,208
Let go.. - Let go of it.

775
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:05,750
Hey, it's beer.

776
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,708
It's fruit beer. Check it properly.

777
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:09,458
You drink alcohol?

778
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:11,166
Hey.. - You drink alcohol?

779
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:13,750
You are trying to spoil our Ronnie?

780
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,791
What are you saying, grandpa? I don't drink.

781
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,083
Ronnie asked me to get them. - You are lying.

782
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,458
Why would Ronnie want them?

783
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:20,791
You think we are stupid?

784
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:23,833
One tight slap and the structure of your face will change.

785
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:28,166
I'll thrash you so hard that you'll forget where you stay.

786
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:30,458
You'll forget your father's name.

787
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:32,750
By the way, what's your father's name? Where do you stay?

788
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,958
Grandpa, he is Mathur's son.

789
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:37,541
The one who has a wretched scooter? Look, it's parked outside.

790
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:38,875
Mathur? - Yes.

791
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:42,625
Who Mathur? - The one whose wife died due to electric shock.

792
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:45,000
The one who stays in a 40-yard house, behind the gutter.

793
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,333
Stop your nonsense.. - The 40-yard house?

794
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:51,916
Near the gutter. - You should stay within your 40 yards.

795
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:53,541
Why have you come here?

796
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:55,166
It's rightly said that the children get spoiled..

797
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:56,625
.. if they lose their mother.

798
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:59,166
And such people need an excuse to do illicit deeds.

799
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,833
Don't you have any shame?

800
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,666
Or have you lost of it?

801
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:04,875
Is this what your parents have taught you?

802
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:06,625
Why are you blaming my parents?

803
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:07,750
Stay within your limit.

804
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:08,750
You are Ronnie's grandpa that's why I am staying quiet.

805
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,166
Otherwise, even I know how to abuse..

806
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:11,291
Look how he is talking to grandpa!

807
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:13,166
Kuku, why are you talking to grandpa in such a manner?

808
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:14,458
Have you lost your mind? - You don't know anything.

809
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:15,750
They have been accusing me since so long.

810
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,750
Grandpa saw liquor bottles in his hand.

811
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,000
He has been abusing grandpa since then. - Yes.

812
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,916
Look, that's how your friends are. - Ronnie, they have been..

813
00:41:21,416 --> 00:41:22,458
Look down when you speak to me!

814
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,333
Apologise to grandpa. - Why should I apologise?

815
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:26,291
They have been abusing me, they should apologise.

816
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:27,833
Just because the Gulatis have opened their second shop..

817
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:28,958
Everything you will say will be right?

818
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:30,583
Just because I am a Mathur, I am not rich, I am wrong?

819
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:31,666
Why are you blabbering nonsense?

820
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:33,083
Hey.. - Have you lost your mind?

821
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:35,708
Apologise to grandpa otherwise we'll be done for good.

822
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:37,958
We'll be done for good? You have changed.

823
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:40,125
I'll see each one of you. I'll see you as well.

824
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:42,625
Get lost! - Hey! Watch out!

825
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:46,625
Don't you dare come here again!

826
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:04,041
Ronnie! Ronnie!

827
00:42:04,541 --> 00:42:06,458
Ronnie! Ronnie! Ronnie! There's Ronnie everywhere!

828
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,041
I'm fed up of this Ronnie.

829
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:10,166
In school he used to say don't tell anyone..

830
00:42:10,666 --> 00:42:11,916
We have a sari shop. We'll joke about it.

831
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:15,208
Now he has become a businessman by selling blouse and petticoat.

832
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:16,541
Ronnie Matching Centre.

833
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:20,458
Not Ronnie Matching Centre, you are a mismatch!

834
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:22,083
Mitali too is one of them.

835
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:23,416
Everything belongs to the Gulatis.

836
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:27,416
Tell me if I don't teach these Gulatis a lesson!

837
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,750
What happened, Angry Young Man?

838
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,625
'He's brother Prabhakar.'

839
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:37,583
'My first cousin from Kanpur.'

840
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:42,833
'He's always at the right place at the right time.'

841
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:45,541
Prabhakar..

842
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:47,166
Hello. - Hi. Come here.

843
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:49,458
Why are you getting so hyper?

844
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:52,291
What's your problem? Tell me. I'll help you find a solution.

845
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:53,958
Have a seat.

846
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:56,416
I provide solution to the world.

847
00:42:56,916 --> 00:42:58,958
Tell me what happened. Do you have problem with your job?

848
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:00,166
What happened?

849
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:02,458
I don't know whether this is a job or a punishment?

850
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:03,666
I knew it.

851
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:06,833
Damn, they keep me running Around the whole day.

852
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:09,125
And that director thinks that he's from Hollywood!

853
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:12,166
Tell me what's my fault if it doesn't rain in desert?

854
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:14,708
What should I do if the hero's hair doesn't grow in a day?

855
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:17,375
Tell me, if the heroine has One and Half spoons of sugar..

856
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:21,791
..instead of One and One forth in her tea then what harm will it do to her?

857
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:24,333
And that hero, he thinks he is Bollywood's superstar.

858
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:26,916
Enough. Enough. Enough. - They have ruined me.

859
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:28,666
No, don't say that. Enough.

860
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:30,041
It will all be okay. - I wanted to open a restaurant.

861
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:33,125
You will open a restaurant. You will.

862
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:35,125
They tell me to make tea, clean the Scooty.

863
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:37,000
Everything will be fine.

864
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,666
I'm telling you, in time, everything will be fine.

865
00:43:39,166 --> 00:43:40,833
Forget about all this.

866
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:44,833
Tell me, who is Ronnie?

867
00:43:57,708 --> 00:44:00,208
'When someone suffers from a stomach-ache..'

868
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:02,958
'The one in front of him becomes a doctor.'

869
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:05,291
'I too consider Prabhakar to be my doctor.'

870
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:07,583
'And I told him everything.'

871
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:10,666
'You know what conclusion did Prabhakar make out of it?'

872
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:14,750
So basically, Gulati and sons have taken you for a ride.

873
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,916
Taken me for a ride? - Yes.

874
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:20,375
This is a very old problem.

875
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:22,750
I have also suffered because of it.

876
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:26,291
'I had a childhood friend, Bindu.'

877
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:30,916
'And I had a childhood sweetheart, Sunaina.'

878
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:36,375
'I loved her in my dreams and planned a family as well.'

879
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:43,166
'But my best friend played a cheap trick and stole her away from me.'

880
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:46,333
Sunaina belonged to him.

881
00:44:46,833 --> 00:44:48,375
Then what happened?

882
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:49,791
What could've happened?

883
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:52,375
Whatever that was done was done by Prabhu.

884
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:54,875
I did it.

885
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:57,333
Priest, do you want imported liquor?

886
00:44:57,833 --> 00:45:02,791
What do I need to do, Prabhakar?

887
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:06,166
Evil powers hover over this child.

888
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:07,541
What?!

889
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,458
There's just one solution for that.

890
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,833
What...? What's the solution?

891
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:16,750
Just tell us. We are ready to do anything.

892
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,125
Bindu, say something, please.

893
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:23,041
You will have to change his name.

894
00:45:23,541 --> 00:45:25,583
From now his name will be..

895
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:29,583
Prabhakar.

896
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:35,375
My Prabhakar!

897
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:38,708
Prabhakar, baby, finish the milk.

898
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:40,875
I love you, Prabhakar.

899
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:42,625
Prabhakar, wear your knickers.

900
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:46,000
Why are you roaming around naked?

901
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,625
Prabhakar!

902
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:51,000
Deenanath Shukla.

903
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,250
Full name.

904
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:58,916
'And at that very moment, I made Prabhakar my godfather.'

905
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:01,625
Sulking won't help.

906
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,583
He didn't just insult you, he insulted me as well.

907
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:06,250
You are my brother.

908
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:09,125
I swear. I feel humiliated.

909
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:11,958
If this was Kanpur I would've made Gulatis apologise..

910
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:13,875
..by threatening them with my knife.

911
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:16,833
End of the topic.

912
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:19,125
Brother, I feel like running away from here.

913
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:22,333
You don't run away.

914
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:25,458
Elope with his girlfriend.

915
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:27,416
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

916
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:29,666
Then his sister.

917
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:31,333
She's just like a sister to me.

918
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,750
Then I'll elope with her.

919
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,583
What's the big deal?

920
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:39,375
You get emotional too soon.

921
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:43,208
Your problem is his business, right?

922
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:48,791
Do one thing, make the income tax guys raid his shop.

923
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:50,875
How will that help?

924
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,875
All their stock is in the warehouse.

925
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:56,041
Then set the warehouse on fire.

926
00:46:56,541 --> 00:47:00,833
Got it?

927
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:03,250
Are you getting me?

928
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:04,958
You are not, right?

929
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:08,958
Then listen to me.

930
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:14,208
Set the warehouse on fire, burn everything..

931
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:17,916
..take everything out of there and sell them.

932
00:47:18,416 --> 00:47:21,583
Whatever cash you get from that, with that we'll open your..

933
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:24,041
Restaurant.

934
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,708
Are you getting me? You are smiling, already.

935
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:29,458
Restaurant..

936
00:47:29,958 --> 00:47:31,541
Is there any other option?

937
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:36,666
I am giving you the throne and you want to go on exile.

938
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:40,083
Let go of my hand. Don't hold it. Let me go.

939
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:41,375
What you do mean? - What do you mean by what do I mean?

940
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:45,125
Do I need to explain everything?

941
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:49,083
Do you want to be a businessman?

942
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:51,708
I want to.

943
00:47:52,208 --> 00:47:54,500
Do you want to ruin Ronnie?

944
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,625
I want to. - Do you want to open a restaurant?

945
00:47:59,125 --> 00:47:59,791
I want to.

946
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:03,333
Do you want to place a bigger board than theirs?

947
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:04,625
I want to be a businessman, ruin Ronnie..

948
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:05,583
..open a restaurant and have a bigger board!

949
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:06,708
Very good!

950
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:08,250
But how will we do this?

951
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:09,750
When will this happen?

952
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:12,250
'It will happen. It will happen on Monday.'

953
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,583
Everyone is requested to attend the prayer meeting..

954
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:18,333
..on Monday at the Monday market.

955
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:22,041
Everyone is welcome to come.

956
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:26,083
We need to cajole Goddess with a lot of love and devotion.

957
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:29,791
Everyone is welcomed to this market.

958
00:48:30,291 --> 00:48:31,000
Hail the Goddess!

959
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,458
Hail the Goddess!

960
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:36,458
Hail the Goddess!

961
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:39,083
Say it affectionately.

962
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,750
Hail the Goddess! - Louder!

963
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,125
Hail the Goddess! - Hail the Goddess!

964
00:48:43,625 --> 00:48:47,125
Hail the Goddess! - Hail the Goddess!

965
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:52,083
Excuse me..

966
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:54,458
Do you wish to drink imported liquor?

967
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:56,125
Yes.

968
00:48:56,625 --> 00:48:59,166
He is my cousin. He needed your help.

969
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:01,125
Come on, Kuku.

970
00:49:01,625 --> 00:49:04,166
Your cousin is my cousin.

971
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:07,541
Won't one brother help another?

972
00:49:08,041 --> 00:49:09,416
Tell me, how can I help you?

973
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:11,333
What you need to do this..

974
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:14,250
You have come from Kanpur today?

975
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:16,125
No, yesterday. - Yesterday.

976
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:19,083
Now listen to what you need to do.. - Where in Kanpur do you stay?

977
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:21,916
Somewhere in north. - In north?

978
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:24,125
Where? - Do you know your way around Kanpur?

979
00:49:24,625 --> 00:49:26,458
Yes, I've been there a lot. - You have.

980
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:27,875
Do you remember the Jharkarkati bridge?

981
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:29,583
Jharkarkati bridge? Yes.

982
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:31,458
Going below it, take a left towards Anand Vihar.

983
00:49:31,958 --> 00:49:33,291
Yes. - The first house on the right side.

984
00:49:33,791 --> 00:49:34,666
What are you saying? - Yes. Right there.

985
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:37,416
My kin's in-laws stay there.

986
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:38,750
I've been there quite often.

987
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,541
That means you are very close.

988
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:45,833
I'm so happy.

989
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:48,708
Jhakarkatti.

990
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:51,750
Are you done?

991
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,208
Yes.

992
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:59,083
Can we get down to business? It's okay. - Oh yes. I forgot.

993
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:02,833
The thing is, during the prayer meet..

994
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,375
Everyone in the vicinity will be there. - Yes.

995
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:10,375
So it's obvious that the Gulati family will also be there. - True.

996
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:11,791
Where will you be?

997
00:50:12,291 --> 00:50:13,791
I'm always at the warehouse.

998
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:14,916
At the warehouse. - Yes.

999
00:50:15,416 --> 00:50:16,541
So, you don't need to do anything. - Okay.

1000
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:18,708
We will come there at night. - Okay.

1001
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:20,250
We will knock at the door. Open it for us.

1002
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,125
Okay. - We will go inside.

1003
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:25,125
We will load all the stock in there into a truck.

1004
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:26,458
Wonderful.

1005
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:28,625
Then we will again go inside. - Again? - Yes.

1006
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:31,458
We'll set the warehouse on fire.

1007
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:33,458
Is that all? -Yes, that's all.

1008
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:35,041
Then consider it done.

1009
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:37,875
Give me that glass. - Just a minute.

1010
00:50:38,375 --> 00:50:41,708
Just a minute.

1011
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:45,916
Shake your head a little. Shake it like this.

1012
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:48,458
We have to set the warehouse on fire.

1013
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:52,750
We have to set the warehouse on fire.

1014
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,500
I won't do this. - Hey..

1015
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,333
You cannot force me. - Sit down. Listen to me.

1016
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:02,458
You cannot force me. - Sit down.

1017
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:05,625
Sit down. - Sit down.

1018
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:07,250
Fire.. - Just a minute.

1019
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,333
A few moments ago you were talking about relationships.

1020
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:10,125
You were addressing me as your brother.

1021
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:12,083
I told you do a small favour and you want to run away!

1022
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:14,250
I am forcing you? - It's not so, brother.

1023
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:16,791
Why is it not so? Listen to me.

1024
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:19,083
I am saying this to you..

1025
00:51:19,583 --> 00:51:21,458
..because Vibhishana held the key to Lanka's downfall.

1026
00:51:21,958 --> 00:51:23,166
And you are our Vibhishana.

1027
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:25,875
Did Vibhishana do anything because he was greedy?

1028
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:27,125
Did he?

1029
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:28,250
Did he?

1030
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,458
He didn't, right? Then?

1031
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:33,208
But he benefited, right?

1032
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:37,208
The warehouse stocks goods worth Rs.15-20 lakhs.

1033
00:51:39,666 --> 00:51:40,541
What are you thinking about?

1034
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:43,541
I am addressing you as Vibhishana..

1035
00:51:44,041 --> 00:51:45,250
Is your brain filled with filth?

1036
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:48,208
Your brain is filled with filth. Spit it out!

1037
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:52,833
Spit it out! - Yes spit it out.

1038
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:54,666
You must be feeling lighter? - Are you?

1039
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:56,041
Come here.

1040
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:58,791
Look, he has been watching us for so long.

1041
00:51:59,291 --> 00:52:00,583
But brother is not calling him.

1042
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:02,541
You are not calling him.

1043
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:05,458
Keep this here.

1044
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:07,458
That's enough. That's enough, brother.

1045
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,958
From tonight, we are partners.

1046
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:13,000
Partner? - Partner.

1047
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,083
Cheers! - Cheers!

1048
00:52:15,583 --> 00:52:16,583
Cheers! - Cheers!

1049
00:52:17,083 --> 00:52:18,708
Tittu, increase the sound of the drums.

1050
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:20,958
Tinku, yes..

1051
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:22,125
Yes, take the guitar.

1052
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:23,666
Mike okay?

1053
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:24,916
Okay.

1054
00:52:25,416 --> 00:52:31,708
"Let's welcome the Goddess.."

1055
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:37,791
"With a hope in heart."

1056
00:52:38,291 --> 00:52:46,708
"Goddess fulfils everyone's wishes.."

1057
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:50,708
"We should keep welcoming her."

1058
00:53:01,916 --> 00:53:02,708
Hello. Hello. Mike testing. Mike testing.

1059
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:04,000
Hello. One, two. One two.

1060
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,583
Monu! - Yes, sir?

01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:33,666
Did you wear it? Did you?

1235
01:02:34,166 --> 01:02:36,833
Will you ever say something or you'll just keep making noises?

1236
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:38,833
You didn't inform me.

1237
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:41,375
I never inform. You know that.

1238
01:02:41,875 --> 01:02:43,666
I just do it.

1239
01:02:44,166 --> 01:02:45,583
How do you look in it?

1240
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:47,333
What can I say?

1241
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:49,041
You can see it for yourself.

1242
01:02:49,541 --> 01:02:52,416
I swear, if I was there..

1243
01:02:52,916 --> 01:02:54,541
I wouldn't tell you, I would've just done it.

1244
01:02:55,041 --> 01:02:55,916
Hey..

1245
01:02:56,416 --> 01:02:57,375
Naughty.

1246
01:02:57,875 --> 01:02:59,000
Who's being naughty?

1247
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,666
I am married to you. It's not a joke!

1248
01:03:01,166 --> 01:03:03,875
You too are just too much!

1249
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:05,750
Hello. Hello?

1250
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,833
Hello. - My game..

1251
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:11,833
Over.

1252
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,750
Switch that off.

1253
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:18,333
Switch it off.

1254
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:19,750
Get your phone out.

1255
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:22,083
Type a message to Ronnie.

1256
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:24,041
Do it.

1257
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:27,250
My dear friend..

1258
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:31,041
Sorry to hear about the fire at your warehouse.

1259
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:32,916
I am outdoors.

1260
01:03:33,416 --> 01:03:36,291
Working, shooting.

1261
01:03:36,791 --> 01:03:38,750
Coming back in two days.

1262
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,208
Then I'll call you.

1263
01:03:40,708 --> 01:03:43,625
Your friend. I love you.

1264
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:47,375
Write it.

1265
01:03:47,875 --> 01:03:49,541
Now keep that in your pocket and listen to me very carefully.

1266
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:50,625
Have you planned everything?

1267
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:52,916
Yes, I have planned everything, brother.

1268
01:03:53,416 --> 01:03:54,541
You found a cashier?

1269
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:57,166
You got the place? The location? And everything else?

1270
01:03:57,666 --> 01:04:01,166
I haven't done all that. - No, you haven't done all that.

1271
01:04:01,666 --> 01:04:03,208
I'm feeling scared for you.

1272
01:04:03,708 --> 01:04:06,750
Give me the money. I'll invest it.

1273
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:09,041
Okay? You'll get double returns.

1274
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:10,666
And by the time you would've made all your plans.

1275
01:04:11,166 --> 01:04:12,416
I have made all the plans.

1276
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:16,250
I'll make you cut the inauguration ribbon.

1277
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:18,458
You are making me emotional.

1278
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:24,041
I'm always ready to cut!

1279
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:28,041
It's just like there's no relief for the chicken or the egg.

1280
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:37,333
Now what does this have to do with the discussion we just had?

1281
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:38,958
Tell me, is it related?

1282
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:40,666
Who's the chicken and who's the egg?

1283
01:04:41,166 --> 01:04:42,000
Who? - It's just a phrase.

1284
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,708
I know it is a phrase. I am not illiterate!

1285
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:46,750
It was fitting the context.

1286
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,375
You have won the contest.

1287
01:04:49,875 --> 01:04:51,958
Actually, brother.. - You got a lot of money.

1288
01:04:52,458 --> 01:04:56,958
How many more contests do you want to win?

1289
01:04:57,458 --> 01:04:59,583
I think it will be very difficult for you.

1290
01:05:00,083 --> 01:05:01,958
Now listen to what I am saying. Rather, jot it down.

1291
01:05:02,458 --> 01:05:04,958
Your restaurant will get build on its own, with magic.

1292
01:05:05,458 --> 01:05:08,958
Just like this. Three, two..

1293
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:24,375
"Fortune is smiling upon us!"

1294
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:29,750
"Fortune is smiling upon us!"

1295
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:36,291
"Fortune is smiling upon us!"

1296
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:40,291
We don't want waiters in our restaurant.

1297
01:05:40,791 --> 01:05:42,333
We need waitresses.

1298
01:05:42,833 --> 01:05:43,875
Waitresses! - Waitresses!

1299
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:45,250
Excuse me, where's Tikona Park?

1300
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:46,708
What? - Tikona Park.

1301
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:48,125
Tikona Park? - Yes.

1302
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:53,000
I don't know. I am new here. - Come on man!

1303
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:54,166
Grandpa used to say..

1304
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:56,541
Never waste time on something that won't give any return.

1305
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:59,208
He was absolutely right.

1306
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:01,583
You are doing great!

1307
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,583
Now you just wait and watch!

1308
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:16,750
'One rides on high confidence when he just becomes a businessman.'

1309
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:21,291
'It was the same with me.'

1310
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:22,708
Hello, aunt. - Hi.

1311
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:25,208
How are you? Can I drop you somewhere?

1312
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:26,583
No, thank you. We don't want to go anywhere.

1313
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:28,125
No, we do. Thank you, son.

1314
01:06:28,625 --> 01:06:29,333
Come on, he will drop us. He is a nice boy.

1315
01:06:29,833 --> 01:06:30,500
Mummy! What are you doing?!

1316
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,916
No, mummy. We don't want to go anywhere.

1317
01:06:32,416 --> 01:06:33,250
Get in. He will drop us.

1318
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:35,541
Mummy.. - Take the first left and then..

1319
01:06:36,041 --> 01:06:38,083
Take a right from the signal, then a left from the circle.

1320
01:06:38,583 --> 01:06:41,000
Third lane from right, the fifth house. I know.

1321
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,458
He is so smart. - How do you know?

1322
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,708
Seema Didi Tuition centre, bang opposite your house.

1323
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:47,000
I was a student there.

1324
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,791
Son, do you work in a vegetable market?

1325
01:06:50,291 --> 01:06:54,291
No, mummy. He has a restaurant.

1326
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:57,458
Of course, I do. Aunt, the DDR, the sweet shop next to it..

1327
01:06:57,958 --> 01:07:00,583
I renovated the wretched place and.. - Show her the menu card.

1328
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:03,625
It must be here.

1329
01:07:04,125 --> 01:07:06,250
Let it be. We don't want to see the menu card.

1330
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:07,583
Come on, mummy!

1331
01:07:08,083 --> 01:07:11,708
Look, aunt, we'll anyway go home and cook.

1332
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:14,833
Come to my restaurant. I'll cook you a nice meal.

1333
01:07:15,333 --> 01:07:16,458
And I'll prove my point to you as well. Okay?

1334
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:19,916
Son, do you make kidney beans with rice?

1335
01:07:20,416 --> 01:07:23,625
What are you doing, mummy?

1336
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:25,333
Of course, aunt. - Let's go.

1337
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:29,333
We'll have lunch and then go home.

1338
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:44,041
"Like a key made for every lock."

1339
01:07:44,541 --> 01:07:47,291
"Like gloves are made for the winter shock."

1340
01:07:47,791 --> 01:07:50,208
"Like biscuit are made for a tea bath."

1341
01:07:50,708 --> 01:07:53,916
"And you are made for me.."

1342
01:07:54,416 --> 01:07:57,250
"Like songs are made to be hummed."

1343
01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:00,458
"Like canteens are made to run on credit."

1344
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:03,458
"Like politicians, to make money."

1345
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:07,250
"And you are made for me."

1346
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,708
"You.."

1347
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:12,041
"Are made for me."

1348
01:08:12,541 --> 01:08:13,916
"Yes, you are made for me."

1349
01:08:14,416 --> 01:08:16,375
"You.."

1350
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:18,666
"Are made for me."

1351
01:08:19,166 --> 01:08:20,416
"Yes, you are made for me."

1352
01:08:20,916 --> 01:08:22,875
"You and I.."

1353
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:27,708
"For each other.."

1354
01:08:28,208 --> 01:08:29,541
"We are made.."

1355
01:08:30,041 --> 01:08:32,791
"Yes! Yes! Yes!"

1356
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:36,125
"Yes! Yes! Yes!"

1357
01:08:36,625 --> 01:08:39,125
"Yes! Yes! Yes!"

1358
01:08:39,625 --> 01:08:43,125
"Yes! Yes! Yes!"

1359
01:08:54,916 --> 01:08:56,541
It's nice, but very dry.

1360
01:08:57,041 --> 01:08:58,416
Oh really!

1361
01:08:58,916 --> 01:09:03,916
You own a restaurant hence you don't like food from elsewhere.

1362
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:09,791
By the way, Kuku, don't you think this name Kuku is a little funny.

1363
01:09:10,291 --> 01:09:12,458
Ku-ku-ku-ku-ku-ku.. - Hey!

1364
01:09:12,958 --> 01:09:14,166
Doesn't anyone in your family have a funny name?

1365
01:09:14,666 --> 01:09:16,875
No. No one in my family has a funny name.

1366
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:21,333
Wonderful. Here I spot two lovebirds!

1367
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:22,500
You guys please..

1368
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Hey you wayward bird!

1369
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,916
Mitali, you turned out to be very smart.

1370
01:09:28,416 --> 01:09:30,708
You were all over Himanshu on a bike just yesterday..

1371
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:33,916
And now you are going for long drives with this Kuku.

1372
01:09:34,416 --> 01:09:36,041
You stole my boyfriend because he has a boyfriend?

1373
01:09:36,541 --> 01:09:37,250
And you?

1374
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:38,666
You gave her a lift and reeled her in, didn't you?

1375
01:09:39,166 --> 01:09:42,250
She has a loose character. A bloody gold-digger.

1376
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:43,458
Rosy.. - What?

1377
01:09:43,958 --> 01:09:45,000
Just shut up, okay! - Shut up.

1378
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:48,041
Shut up! When? Why? How? Where?

1379
01:09:48,541 --> 01:09:50,083
Why shut up? Why is everyone being shut up here?

1380
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:52,625
Listen up, "Shut up" girl. Don't act smart.

1381
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:54,333
The whole vicinity knows everything about you.

1382
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:58,333
Rosy, why are you guys.. - Settle down, wild cat!

1383
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:01,708
Mitali, what do you think this Kuku is?

1384
01:10:02,208 --> 01:10:03,583
He used to serve tea at our production house.

1385
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:05,000
He used to hold the Styrofoam.

1386
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,583
He used to clean the Scooty.

1387
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:07,916
He used to slouch while walking.

1388
01:10:08,416 --> 01:10:11,541
Take this, take that. From here.. - Hey Monkey, get going from here!

1389
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:17,500
Hey Hrithik Roshan, every movie has just one hero.

1390
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,083
And I am the hero of this movie.

1391
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:21,291
Got it?

1392
01:10:21,791 --> 01:10:23,041
You? A hero?

1393
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:24,458
Have you ever seen your face in the mirror?

1394
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:27,041
Hey! - Shall I tell you his boyfriend's tales?

1395
01:10:27,541 --> 01:10:31,125
Boyfriend? - Yes.

1396
01:10:31,625 --> 01:10:32,458
We came here to have a cup of coffee.

1397
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:33,750
We don't want to drink coffee.

1398
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:35,458
We don't want to discuss this matter. - Take him away. Leave.

1399
01:10:35,958 --> 01:10:37,625
We don't want to discuss this matter.

1400
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:39,125
We are leaving. We are decent people.

1401
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:40,291
Let's go. - Why should we leave? - Take her away.

1402
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:42,041
Why should we leave just because a worthless tea server said something?

1403
01:10:42,541 --> 01:10:43,041
Who are you calling a tea server?

1404
01:10:43,541 --> 01:10:44,708
Who is he? - Back off! - Let it go.

1405
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:45,750
I'll tell you all the tales about his boyfriend.

1406
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:47,375
What does he think of himself? - Should I tell about your boyfriend?

1407
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:48,750
Say whatever you want! I don't care! - Let's go! - Take her away!

1408
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:50,208
Bloody spot boy! - Haryanvi actor.

1409
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:51,833
And you! You turned out to be gay!

1410
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:54,041
You said those dialogues of heaven's bird in front of me..

1411
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:56,458
Leave! - Did I say anything?

1412
01:10:56,958 --> 01:10:58,666
I didn't say anything.

1413
01:10:59,166 --> 01:11:02,666
Let's enjoy.

1414
01:11:14,625 --> 01:11:15,958
Churanlal.

1415
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:17,750
What?

1416
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:21,416
My paternal uncle's name.

1417
01:11:21,916 --> 01:11:23,708
Gimmy uncle..

1418
01:11:24,208 --> 01:11:26,875
My maternal uncle.

1419
01:11:27,375 --> 01:11:29,750
And do you know what my maternal aunt's name is?

1420
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:31,375
What?

1421
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:35,416
Polly.

1422
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:38,875
Mithu. - What?

1423
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:40,833
My name.

1424
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:44,833
Mithu?

1425
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:52,791
"There's a lot to talk about."

1426
01:11:53,291 --> 01:11:56,083
"This life is meant to be spent with you."

1427
01:11:56,583 --> 01:11:59,125
"A sign is enough to say it all."

1428
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:02,791
"That you.. are made for me."

1429
01:12:03,291 --> 01:12:05,291
"You.."

1430
01:12:05,791 --> 01:12:07,666
"Are made for me."

1431
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:09,458
"Yes, you are made for me."

1432
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:12,000
"You.."

1433
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,250
"Are made for me."

1434
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:16,041
"Yes, you are made for me."

1435
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:18,500
"You and I.."

1436
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,291
"For each other.."

1437
01:12:23,791 --> 01:12:27,291
"We are made.."

1438
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:32,791
What is this, Kuku!

1439
01:12:33,291 --> 01:12:34,000
I've been calling you since the past one month!

1440
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:35,708
You aren't answering my calls. You are disconnecting them.

1441
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:38,250
Talk softly. - It's been a month you've not being coming for work.

1442
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:41,916
You should at least return the company's goods if you have left the job.

1443
01:12:42,416 --> 01:12:43,875
My father wasn't keeping well. That's why I couldn't come.

1444
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:46,708
Your father was unwell, but you were fine, right?

1445
01:12:47,208 --> 01:12:48,875
Talk softly. I'll give them to you tomorrow.

1446
01:12:49,375 --> 01:12:50,958
Please leave. Please. - Okay. I am leaving.

1447
01:12:51,458 --> 01:12:54,958
But don't forget it. - I won't.

1448
01:13:01,458 --> 01:13:08,333
Son, where have you been going if not at work?

1449
01:13:08,833 --> 01:13:10,250
Well..

1450
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:14,250
This is it, papa.

1451
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:33,708
Kuku Kwalti..

1452
01:13:38,291 --> 01:13:42,416
Where did you get the money to do all this?

1453
01:13:42,916 --> 01:13:47,416
Uncle, you know, as there a queen behind every king..

1454
01:13:47,916 --> 01:13:50,166
There's the same story behind every business.

1455
01:13:50,666 --> 01:13:52,916
And the title of that story is "sponsor".

1456
01:13:53,416 --> 01:13:54,541
We have one.

1457
01:13:55,041 --> 01:13:57,875
You didn't get me? We got the money.

1458
01:13:58,375 --> 01:13:59,333
Then why did you hide it from me?

1459
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:03,166
Who is the sponsor?

1460
01:14:03,666 --> 01:14:07,166
I'll introduce him to you.

1461
01:14:08,916 --> 01:14:10,916
Hey! - Hi.

1462
01:14:11,416 --> 01:14:13,250
George says..

1463
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,208
George?

1464
01:14:15,708 --> 01:14:17,583
George Bush, the one in America..

1465
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:19,791
Okay. - What does he say?

1466
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:22,416
There are two things in a business.

1467
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:25,166
Capital and return.

1468
01:14:25,666 --> 01:14:29,041
But you don't get return from the capital.

1469
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:32,166
You get return from talent.

1470
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:34,416
One day he feed me.

1471
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:35,916
What did he feed me?

1472
01:14:36,416 --> 01:14:37,791
Sweets?

1473
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:39,208
Potatoes.

1474
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:40,333
Sweets made out of potatoes.

1475
01:14:40,833 --> 01:14:41,916
Sweets made out of potatoes, sir.

1476
01:14:42,416 --> 01:14:45,041
Just imagine. He fed me sweets made out of potatoes.

1477
01:14:45,541 --> 01:14:47,500
Right then I decided..

1478
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:54,041
I decided that I will invest in this talent.

1479
01:14:54,541 --> 01:14:56,375
Thank you very much, sir.

1480
01:14:56,875 --> 01:15:00,875
Being a third-person you recognised my son's talent.

1481
01:15:01,375 --> 01:15:02,208
Thank you. - It's okay.

1482
01:15:02,708 --> 01:15:08,708
I thought that as my son didn't join NASA as a scientist..

1483
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:13,208
..he has failed in the trial of life as well.

1484
01:15:13,708 --> 01:15:17,791
Sir, these has been something that has been worrying me these days.

1485
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:25,708
Why? - Our company is getting privatised.

1486
01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:30,750
But Kuku..

1487
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:32,791
Sorry, son.

1488
01:15:33,291 --> 01:15:36,375
I didn't support you.

1489
01:15:36,875 --> 01:15:39,916
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1490
01:15:40,416 --> 01:15:44,291
I'm sorry, son. - It's okay, uncle.

1491
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:46,875
It's okay. - It's okay.

1492
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:51,000
I'm sorry, son.

1493
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:55,000
It's okay, uncle.

1494
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:05,125
You are again reading.

1495
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:09,166
I used to score good marks in school. Ask me how.

1496
01:16:09,666 --> 01:16:13,166
How? - How?

1497
01:16:20,791 --> 01:16:22,166
Ronnie? - Who else?

1498
01:16:22,666 --> 01:16:25,541
How are you, bro?!

1499
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:28,208
I'm fine. - You've become a big shot.

1500
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:29,791
You've started such a big restaurant.

1501
01:16:30,291 --> 01:16:31,166
You didn't call me.

1502
01:16:31,666 --> 01:16:32,708
I was going to call you..

1503
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:35,083
Cool. It's okay. It happens.

1504
01:16:35,583 --> 01:16:36,458
I can understand.

1505
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:39,041
Do all the workers work under you?

1506
01:16:39,541 --> 01:16:40,250
That's great.

1507
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:42,833
You remember our teacher Kalpana ma'am in the seventh grade? - Yes.

1508
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:44,291
She used to always leave a remark on your report card..

1509
01:16:44,791 --> 01:16:45,625
"Kuku Mathur can do better."

1510
01:16:46,125 --> 01:16:47,041
"Kuku Mathur can do better."

1511
01:16:47,541 --> 01:16:48,750
I never understood what it meant.

1512
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:50,291
I understood that today.

1513
01:16:50,791 --> 01:16:53,916
You have proven it, bro! Kuku Mathur can actually do better.

1514
01:16:54,416 --> 01:16:56,250
What did I do? My grandpa owns a sari shop.

1515
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:57,708
He made me sell blouses.

1516
01:16:58,208 --> 01:17:00,291
Gulati Sons became Gulati Sons and Grandsons.

1517
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:02,375
It's great. - What's great in that?

1518
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:04,166
You are the one who is great.

1519
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:06,083
I am proud of you.

1520
01:17:06,583 --> 01:17:07,791
It's doing well.

1521
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:10,125
I've brought a gift for you. Unwrap it.

1522
01:17:10,625 --> 01:17:12,791
What is it? - Open it. Have a look at it for yourself.

1523
01:17:13,291 --> 01:17:14,541
It will bring back fond memories. - Fruit beer?

1524
01:17:15,041 --> 01:17:16,708
What else!

1525
01:17:17,208 --> 01:17:18,916
Air-conditioned!

1526
01:17:19,416 --> 01:17:21,583
It blows cool air! - Just..

1527
01:17:22,083 --> 01:17:24,083
Who invested in this business?

1528
01:17:24,583 --> 01:17:27,166
My father took a loan. - Great.

1529
01:17:27,666 --> 01:17:30,041
You tell me about yourself. How's work?

1530
01:17:30,541 --> 01:17:32,000
It's going just fine.

1531
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:36,041
You know that the warehouse caught fire on the night of the prayer meet.

1532
01:17:36,541 --> 01:17:38,000
Goods worth Rs. 15 lakhs got burned.

1533
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,416
15 lakhs? - Yes.

1534
01:17:40,916 --> 01:17:42,875
We are facing a little cash crunch since then.

1535
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:45,541
You were there. - Yes, I was there.

1536
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:47,541
Chota was dressed as the Goddess.

1537
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:49,750
The TV star that plays the role of Jatayu had come.

1538
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:51,250
Forget about it.

1539
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:52,666
I made you sentimental, didn't I? - Yes.

1540
01:17:53,166 --> 01:17:55,416
Why are you eating this? - Chutney. Get some chutney!

1541
01:17:55,916 --> 01:17:57,458
Chotu! Why didn't you get the chutney?

1542
01:17:57,958 --> 01:17:58,750
Why are you taking so long?

1543
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:03,208
Drink it. - Tell me, how's life?

1544
01:18:03,708 --> 01:18:08,041
'Time used to fly when we used to drink at the warehouse.'

1545
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:10,833
'But that day when Ronnie came to the restaurant..'

1546
01:18:11,333 --> 01:18:15,083
'I just felt that we should consume all the fruit beer quickly..'

1547
01:18:15,583 --> 01:18:19,083
'So that Ronnie leaves this place.'

1548
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:22,208
You didn't print calendars?

1549
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:26,416
I was going to but.. - Print them. Has big impact.

1550
01:18:26,916 --> 01:18:28,708
Menu card. Shall I take them? I'll distribute them.

1551
01:18:29,208 --> 01:18:31,916
Okay - Okay?

1552
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,041
It was fun to meet you after so many days.

1553
01:18:34,541 --> 01:18:37,208
Kuku Mathur. You do your job. I'll call you tonight.

1554
01:18:37,708 --> 01:18:41,208
I'll go and distribute these. Okay.

1555
01:18:53,541 --> 01:18:58,000
'I was feeling a little strange that day.'

1556
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,541
'I couldn't sleep at night.'

1557
01:19:00,041 --> 01:19:03,916
'I stayed back at the restaurant.'

1558
01:19:04,416 --> 01:19:07,791
'I got up with a headache.'

1559
01:19:08,291 --> 01:19:09,458
'I had warm water.'

1560
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,208
'I did yoga.'

1561
01:19:11,708 --> 01:19:14,041
'I didn't suffer from constipation either.'

1562
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:17,583
'Yet I was feeling a little strange.'

1563
01:19:18,083 --> 01:19:19,791
Kuku.. - Yes.

1564
01:19:20,291 --> 01:19:23,458
Is Sunday a holiday for businessmen as well?

1565
01:19:23,958 --> 01:19:30,125
I was just enquiring because you didn't go to the restaurant.

1566
01:19:30,625 --> 01:19:33,625
I am just getting ready, papa.

1567
01:19:34,125 --> 01:19:35,791
Nephew? - Yes?

1568
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:38,666
What's wrong with him?

1569
01:19:39,166 --> 01:19:42,291
Forget about him, uncle. I am worried about you.

1570
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:43,958
What's wrong with me, Prabhakar?

1571
01:19:44,458 --> 01:19:46,791
You said that your company is getting privatised.

1572
01:19:47,291 --> 01:19:48,458
Yes, so?

1573
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:49,833
Look, uncle..

1574
01:19:50,333 --> 01:19:52,041
Please don't mind but..

1575
01:19:52,541 --> 01:19:58,458
..there's a vast difference between MA, BA and MBA.

1576
01:19:58,958 --> 01:20:01,625
It's not so. You can think over it. There's no hurry.

1577
01:20:02,125 --> 01:20:02,708
You can think over it.

1578
01:20:03,208 --> 01:20:07,958
I meant that you may have to pay dearly because of computerization.

1579
01:20:08,458 --> 01:20:13,166
Blessings wish to reach you..

1580
01:20:13,666 --> 01:20:17,500
..but there are a lot of obstacles in its path.

1581
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:25,791
Traffic jams, no entry, railway crossing, check posts..

1582
01:20:26,291 --> 01:20:31,958
By the time blessings pass through all these, it's exhausted.

1583
01:20:32,458 --> 01:20:34,291
It's shattered.

1584
01:20:34,791 --> 01:20:38,875
How can blessings meant for you..

1585
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:43,041
..reach you hot and fresh?

1586
01:20:43,541 --> 01:20:44,541
What should we do for that?

1587
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:46,791
I have some money.

1588
01:20:47,291 --> 01:20:49,875
No, we don't need money.

1589
01:20:50,375 --> 01:20:53,541
You paid the entry fee, right?

1590
01:20:54,041 --> 01:20:56,041
Then why should you pay every time?

1591
01:20:56,541 --> 01:21:03,125
We need your devotion, your dedication, your sacrifice..

1592
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:04,750
That is what we want.

1593
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:07,833
Begin. - Okay.

1594
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:12,208
Any devotee who wishes to ask a question to him can raise his hand.

1595
01:21:12,708 --> 01:21:14,375
Calm down.

1596
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:16,791
Me! Me! Me!

1597
01:21:17,291 --> 01:21:19,458
Hey, give it to me.

1598
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:20,583
Yes, ma'am?

1599
01:21:21,083 --> 01:21:22,458
Hello, sage.

1600
01:21:22,958 --> 01:21:24,458
I have two sons.

1601
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:26,833
They have always been fighting since they were kids.

1602
01:21:27,333 --> 01:21:28,958
We have split the property.

1603
01:21:29,458 --> 01:21:31,500
I sometimes stay with one and sometimes with the other.

1604
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,875
I cry a lot.

1605
01:21:34,375 --> 01:21:36,500
Do you enjoy eating fried bread with tangy chutney?

1606
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:37,833
What?

1607
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:41,208
Do you? - Sometimes.

1608
01:21:41,708 --> 01:21:44,416
Which chutney do you use? The red one or the green one?

1609
01:21:44,916 --> 01:21:48,791
The red one with dry ginger in it.

1610
01:21:49,291 --> 01:21:51,250
Try using the green chutney this time.

1611
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:55,833
Okay. - And offer green bangles to Goddess.

1612
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:57,541
Okay. - She will bless you.

1613
01:21:58,041 --> 01:21:59,750
Praises to the sage!

1614
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,833
Praises to the sage!

1615
01:22:02,333 --> 01:22:05,750
Me! Me! Me!

1616
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:09,041
You..

1617
01:22:09,541 --> 01:22:10,416
Hello, sage.

1618
01:22:10,916 --> 01:22:13,833
I keep studying all year around.

1619
01:22:14,333 --> 01:22:16,375
But I mess up doing the exams.

1620
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:19,000
My family too has warned me that if I don't clear..

1621
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:23,000
..my exams this year that they will make me sell vegetables.

1622
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,000
Do you drink alcohol? - No.

1623
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,625
Never. I never even touch it.

1624
01:22:27,125 --> 01:22:28,416
A cap full? - Never.

1625
01:22:28,916 --> 01:22:30,000
Have friends ever given to you saying it's a cold drink?

1626
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:31,875
No, no, no. Never.

1627
01:22:32,375 --> 01:22:34,125
Do you have a liquor shop close to your house?

1628
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:36,250
Yes, a little ahead of my house.

1629
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:38,833
On the left? - No, on the right.

1630
01:22:39,333 --> 01:22:40,958
It will be on the right side when you are returning, right?

1631
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:43,125
Yes.

1632
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:46,625
While returning, buy a beer from the liquor shop..

1633
01:22:47,125 --> 01:22:48,708
Chilled or room temperature?

1634
01:22:49,208 --> 01:22:51,041
Chilled? - Okay.

1635
01:22:51,541 --> 01:22:53,833
And give offerings to Goddess. - Okay.

1636
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:55,166
Praises to the sage! - Thank you.

1637
01:22:55,666 --> 01:22:56,541
Praises to the sage!

1638
01:22:57,041 --> 01:22:58,333
Praises to the sage!

1639
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:00,291
Excuse me, let go of it for a second.

1640
01:23:00,791 --> 01:23:03,208
One question! Just one question!

1641
01:23:03,708 --> 01:23:05,125
Calm down! Silence!

1642
01:23:05,625 --> 01:23:06,791
What do you want?

1643
01:23:07,291 --> 01:23:09,291
Blessings!

1644
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:10,958
What kind of blessings do you want?

1645
01:23:11,458 --> 01:23:13,083
Hot and.. - Fresh!

1646
01:23:13,583 --> 01:23:15,375
Hot and.. - Fresh!

1647
01:23:15,875 --> 01:23:17,583
Hot and.. - Fresh!

1648
01:23:18,083 --> 01:23:19,875
Praise the Lord! - Praise the Lord!

1649
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:21,791
Praises to the sage!

1650
01:23:22,291 --> 01:23:25,833
You can add him on Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp.

1651
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:27,625
I, too, want to meet him.

1652
01:23:28,125 --> 01:23:33,583
Rs. 500 for a private session. Any time, any where.

1653
01:23:34,083 --> 01:23:36,333
Do you understand what faith is?

1654
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:38,166
Belief?

1655
01:23:38,666 --> 01:23:46,416
When a person's faith in a statue decreases he comes to me.

1656
01:23:46,916 --> 01:23:51,833
And put the same faith back in something else and return it to him.

1657
01:23:52,333 --> 01:23:53,458
Faith.

1658
01:23:53,958 --> 01:23:55,750
Look..

1659
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:57,208
Faith.

1660
01:23:57,708 --> 01:23:58,708
My faith in you.

1661
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:01,083
Your faith in me.

1662
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:06,083
But how will I know that my faith has been restored?

1663
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:08,041
A signal.

1664
01:24:08,541 --> 01:24:11,208
A sign.

1665
01:24:11,708 --> 01:24:13,000
A lighting..

1666
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:16,000
Or a sound.

1667
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:20,625
And you will believe that there's faith.

1668
01:24:21,125 --> 01:24:21,875
Enlightenment.

1669
01:24:22,375 --> 01:24:25,083
What did you just say?

1670
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:26,375
Enlightenment.

1671
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:28,375
What an amazing thought!

1672
01:24:28,875 --> 01:24:30,333
What an amazing thought indeed!

1673
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:33,708
My soul spoke! Amazing! - Look! I've got goosebumps.

1674
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:38,750
I've got goosebumps. - Yes. But when will I get enlightenment?

1675
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:40,541
You will, you fool.

1676
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:44,333
Today it was my turn. Soon it will be yours.

1677
01:24:44,833 --> 01:24:46,583
Enlightenment.

1678
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:48,875
Her blessings will always be with you. Go.

1679
01:24:49,375 --> 01:24:50,583
Greet him. - "Distances were expunged.."

1680
01:24:51,083 --> 01:24:55,333
Sage.. Get up. Get up. - "And we got close.."

1681
01:24:55,833 --> 01:24:57,583
"It's a strange experience."

1682
01:24:58,083 --> 01:24:58,958
You have met him. Now everything will be fine.

1683
01:24:59,458 --> 01:25:04,583
"Let me just express my feelings now.."

1684
01:25:05,083 --> 01:25:08,125
"This is a strange co-incidence!"

1685
01:25:08,625 --> 01:25:12,125
You are seriously so disgraceful!

1686
01:25:16,291 --> 01:25:18,333
Just a minute. I'll call you back.

1687
01:25:18,833 --> 01:25:20,625
What is it? - Where's Kuku?

1688
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:23,333
Kuku! What happened?

1689
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:25,375
He's not answering his phone.

1690
01:25:25,875 --> 01:25:28,666
He's answering all my calls.

1691
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:32,125
Is he ignoring you?

1692
01:25:32,625 --> 01:25:37,041
You are not someone who can be ignored.

1693
01:25:37,541 --> 01:25:43,291
Hey, I was just saying..

1694
01:25:43,791 --> 01:25:45,958
You are such a scoundrel, Prabhakar!

1695
01:25:46,458 --> 01:25:49,958
I swear! What are you doing?

1696
01:25:57,291 --> 01:26:00,791
I couldn't understand when and how will this enlightenment happen.

1697
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:09,916
Kuku, Chota is crying. - What?

1698
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:14,458
What is it? - You just come home quickly.

1699
01:26:14,958 --> 01:26:18,791
Chota! Open the door, Chota!

1700
01:26:19,291 --> 01:26:20,541
What happened? - I don't know. She isn't opening the door.

1701
01:26:21,041 --> 01:26:21,791
Open the door, Chota.

1702
01:26:22,291 --> 01:26:23,875
Chota! - Chota!

1703
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:25,875
Open the door! What's wrong?

1704
01:26:26,375 --> 01:26:27,333
She has been crying since the time she returned from school.

1705
01:26:27,833 --> 01:26:31,333
She's not telling me what happened. - Chota!

1706
01:26:33,916 --> 01:26:36,916
Move away, Mitali.

1707
01:26:37,416 --> 01:26:38,916
Chota, please stop crying.

1708
01:26:39,416 --> 01:26:41,875
No, brother. Please don't open the door.

1709
01:26:42,375 --> 01:26:42,791
Please don't do anything stupid.

1710
01:26:43,291 --> 01:26:44,666
Chota. - Tell me what's wrong.

1711
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:47,875
No, I don't want to tell you anything.

1712
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:50,750
Do you remember what mom used to say?

1713
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:53,708
We will solve all our problems together.

1714
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:59,000
I am coming inside. And you will tell me what's wrong. Okay?

1715
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:00,750
What's wrong, Chota? - Chota.

1716
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:04,916
What happened? - I will fail, brother.

1717
01:27:05,416 --> 01:27:08,000
Why? You said that all your exams went well.

1718
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,416
I leaked the exam papers.

1719
01:27:10,916 --> 01:27:14,458
I was well prepared. I had to only study three chapters.

1720
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:17,958
But brother Prabhakar kept saying "Ask how!"..

1721
01:27:18,458 --> 01:27:21,458
"Ask how one can get more marks without studying."

1722
01:27:21,958 --> 01:27:23,375
So I asked.

1723
01:27:23,875 --> 01:27:26,166
He took me to Friends Colony.

1724
01:27:26,666 --> 01:27:27,708
To the Printing Press.

1725
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:30,291
We leaked the papers from there.

1726
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:32,458
English, maths, science, social..

1727
01:27:32,958 --> 01:27:34,958
All the papers were the same.

1728
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:37,416
But then madam came to know about it.

1729
01:27:37,916 --> 01:27:42,250
She changed the Sanskrit question paper.

1730
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:42,708
Don't cry.

1731
01:27:43,208 --> 01:27:47,416
To me, Prabhakar always looked liked a criminal.

1732
01:27:47,916 --> 01:27:49,375
He did this with me as well.

1733
01:27:49,875 --> 01:27:54,458
If I wanted I could have topped.

1734
01:27:54,958 --> 01:28:00,708
If I wanted, if not a restaurant, I could've opened a food stall.

1735
01:28:01,208 --> 01:28:06,041
But I got influenced by Prabhakar and leaked the paper.

1736
01:28:06,541 --> 01:28:11,500
And I got influenced by him and set Ronnie's warehouse on fire.

1737
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,500
You set Ronnie's warehouse on fire?

1738
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,333
What are you saying, Kuku!

1739
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:20,916
I cannot even apologise to Neetu ma'am.

1740
01:28:21,416 --> 01:28:23,375
Kuku this..

1741
01:28:23,875 --> 01:28:26,041
'A signal.'

1742
01:28:26,541 --> 01:28:28,541
'Or a lightening..'

1743
01:28:29,041 --> 01:28:31,708
'Lights will switch off and on.'

1744
01:28:32,208 --> 01:28:35,708
'Enlightenment.'

1745
01:28:42,291 --> 01:28:44,583
Light, truth.

1746
01:28:45,083 --> 01:28:46,583
Enlightenment!

1747
01:28:47,083 --> 01:28:49,958
Mitali, it's enlightenment!

1748
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:52,083
Mitali, it's enlightenment! - What?

1749
01:28:52,583 --> 01:28:53,583
I'm getting enlightened.

1750
01:28:54,083 --> 01:28:55,125
This is enlightenment!

1751
01:28:55,625 --> 01:28:56,291
The light of truth.

1752
01:28:56,791 --> 01:28:59,125
I have realised what mistake I have made.

1753
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:00,583
I will apologise to Ronnie.

1754
01:29:01,083 --> 01:29:02,291
I will tell everything to Ronnie.

1755
01:29:02,791 --> 01:29:03,416
Don't cry.

1756
01:29:03,916 --> 01:29:06,625
Mitali, I will apologise to Ronnie.

1757
01:29:07,125 --> 01:29:10,625
I will apologise to him.

1758
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:31,583
Papa?

1759
01:29:32,083 --> 01:29:33,208
Did you leave office early today?

1760
01:29:33,708 --> 01:29:37,416
I didn't leave early, son. I've left office forever.

1761
01:29:37,916 --> 01:29:40,458
What do you mean? - I mean, I took VRS.

1762
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:43,666
Look, I have got millions.

1763
01:29:44,166 --> 01:29:47,083
Now I will invest this money in your business.

1764
01:29:47,583 --> 01:29:48,750
Why?

1765
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:51,708
Your brother Prabhakar gave me a very good idea.

1766
01:29:52,208 --> 01:29:55,708
What's the use of a private job?

1767
01:29:59,375 --> 01:30:01,416
I am sorry, papa.

1768
01:30:01,916 --> 01:30:05,416
Kuku, it's okay. - I am sorry.

1769
01:30:09,208 --> 01:30:10,666
Hey..

1770
01:30:11,166 --> 01:30:15,666
My son got emotional.

1771
01:30:16,166 --> 01:30:19,458
What's wrong with the lights?

1772
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:22,458
I think the voltage is down.

1773
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:24,958
Maybe you need to understand.

1774
01:30:25,458 --> 01:30:29,208
Everyone has reasons, not just one. Do you understand?

1775
01:30:29,708 --> 01:30:31,250
Don't you have any shame? - Wait.

1776
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:32,458
You are a criminal!

1777
01:30:32,958 --> 01:30:34,041
You made me a thief! - Wait.

1778
01:30:34,541 --> 01:30:35,333
What happened, Angry Young Man?

1779
01:30:35,833 --> 01:30:37,208
You happened, Prabhakar Shukla! You!

1780
01:30:37,708 --> 01:30:39,833
I ruined my best friend because of you.

1781
01:30:40,333 --> 01:30:41,791
Chota flunked because of you!

1782
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:42,875
My father lost his job!

1783
01:30:43,375 --> 01:30:44,916
Calm down, Mathur. Please let me explain.

1784
01:30:45,416 --> 01:30:47,416
What will you explain? What will you explain?

1785
01:30:47,916 --> 01:30:49,833
You made me steal and then you stole from me.

1786
01:30:50,333 --> 01:30:51,833
You sold goods worth Rs. 15 lakhs and gave me 12 lakhs.

1787
01:30:52,333 --> 01:30:55,708
That night when you tore Ronnie matching centre's calendar..

1788
01:30:56,208 --> 01:30:58,166
What was going on in your mind?

1789
01:30:58,666 --> 01:30:59,458
What difference does that make? - No, no, no.

1790
01:30:59,958 --> 01:31:01,333
What was more important at that moment?

1791
01:31:01,833 --> 01:31:06,583
What difference does that make? - Friend or business?

1792
01:31:07,083 --> 01:31:08,083
Yes?

1793
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:11,083
Business.

1794
01:31:11,583 --> 01:31:14,458
So, I tried my best and made you a businessman.

1795
01:31:14,958 --> 01:31:17,333
I fulfilled my promise.

1796
01:31:17,833 --> 01:31:20,208
Kuku Mathur, I only showed you the path.

1797
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:22,291
These are your deeds.

1798
01:31:22,791 --> 01:31:23,666
And it's not as if you have done something big.

1799
01:31:24,166 --> 01:31:28,708
It's not like Ronnie's grandpa did a noble deed and made that warehouse.

1800
01:31:29,208 --> 01:31:34,958
Every businessman has to use another to become a businessman.

1801
01:31:35,458 --> 01:31:37,708
Now tell me what's more important for you?

1802
01:31:38,208 --> 01:31:40,916
Business or friend?

1803
01:31:41,416 --> 01:31:42,666
Friend. - What did you say?

1804
01:31:43,166 --> 01:31:44,625
Friend. - Speak louder. I didn't hear you.

1805
01:31:45,125 --> 01:31:46,833
Friend. - That's fantastic, brother!

1806
01:31:47,333 --> 01:31:48,458
Go to your friend and give him a hug.

1807
01:31:48,958 --> 01:31:50,625
God willing he will forgive you.

1808
01:31:51,125 --> 01:31:52,041
Go. Go. Go.

1809
01:31:52,541 --> 01:31:53,875
Good luck. Listen..

1810
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:57,833
Blame it to me. I'll handle it. - Okay.

1811
01:31:58,333 --> 01:31:59,833
Most welcome.

1812
01:32:00,333 --> 01:32:03,833
Go. Run!

1813
01:32:05,708 --> 01:32:09,208
Run! Run!

1814
01:32:11,458 --> 01:32:14,958
You are.. no you.

1815
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:31,458
What the..

1816
01:32:31,958 --> 01:32:33,541
Ask him that shop's address! - He doesn't know.

1817
01:32:34,041 --> 01:32:34,833
He is new to the city.

1818
01:32:35,333 --> 01:32:37,125
Look at this! This yellow one. - No.

1819
01:32:37,625 --> 01:32:38,333
Look at its border.

1820
01:32:38,833 --> 01:32:41,333
Rs. 500.. - Rs. 500! We don't have any sari worth Rs. 500!

1821
01:32:41,833 --> 01:32:43,000
The cheapest one is worth Rs. 750.

1822
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:44,416
I'll show them to you. - Get them out.

1823
01:32:44,916 --> 01:32:46,333
Drink a cold drink for her. - No? - No?

1824
01:32:46,833 --> 01:32:48,541
What colour do you want? Tell me at least something.

1825
01:32:49,041 --> 01:32:50,291
Check out their gentry and then show them the saris.

1826
01:32:50,791 --> 01:32:55,458
Here. Show her this magenta sari. She will like it.

1827
01:32:55,958 --> 01:32:56,791
Welcome, madam.

1828
01:32:57,291 --> 01:32:58,458
Get a cold drink for her.

1829
01:32:58,958 --> 01:33:00,291
We sell all kinds of saris.

1830
01:33:00,791 --> 01:33:02,916
For parties, for birthdays and for special prayer meetings.

1831
01:33:03,416 --> 01:33:04,625
So, which one do you want?

1832
01:33:05,125 --> 01:33:06,708
Suresh. - What kind of a sari is Suresh?

1833
01:33:07,208 --> 01:33:08,583
I mean which Suresh do you want?

1834
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:09,916
My Suresh.

1835
01:33:10,416 --> 01:33:11,916
That's fine. But where are you from?

1836
01:33:12,416 --> 01:33:13,208
Darbhanga.

1837
01:33:13,708 --> 01:33:16,666
Darbhanga?

1838
01:33:17,166 --> 01:33:18,375
You are Bihari's wife!

1839
01:33:18,875 --> 01:33:19,958
She is Bihari's wife! It's okay.

1840
01:33:20,458 --> 01:33:21,833
Have a seat. I'll call Bihari! - Wait!

1841
01:33:22,333 --> 01:33:22,958
Call Bihari!

1842
01:33:23,458 --> 01:33:24,791
Himanshu! - What happened?

1843
01:33:25,291 --> 01:33:28,000
This sari is from that lot! - Which lot?

1844
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:31,666
The lot that got burned in the warehouse.

1845
01:33:32,166 --> 01:33:34,875
The sari from the lot that got burned in the warehouse?

1846
01:33:35,375 --> 01:33:36,166
What is the sari from the lot that got burned..

1847
01:33:36,666 --> 01:33:37,541
..in the warehouse doing with you?

1848
01:33:38,041 --> 01:33:38,666
How did you get it?

1849
01:33:39,166 --> 01:33:40,208
Bihari gave it to you, didn't he?

1850
01:33:40,708 --> 01:33:41,750
Bihari gave it to you? Move aside!

1851
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:43,458
You are wearing our sari and smiling!

1852
01:33:43,958 --> 01:33:47,958
Go and call Bihari!

1853
01:33:48,458 --> 01:33:51,958
Call Bihari! - Bihari!

1854
01:34:06,958 --> 01:34:07,666
Hit him!

1855
01:34:08,166 --> 01:34:10,166
Why are you hitting him? - Move aside!

1856
01:34:10,666 --> 01:34:13,458
He hooked up with my girlfriend using my money!

1857
01:34:13,958 --> 01:34:15,875
What are you waiting for? Get the car!

1858
01:34:16,375 --> 01:34:17,833
Move aside, Ronnie!

1859
01:34:18,333 --> 01:34:19,958
You just wait and watch! We'll turn him into a ghost.

1860
01:34:20,458 --> 01:34:21,833
He has locked horns with Gulati's.

1861
01:34:22,333 --> 01:34:23,458
Bihari, I'll get back to you as well.

1862
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:25,958
Hey but brother.. - Let's go.

1863
01:34:26,458 --> 01:34:30,041
What are they saying? Kuku cannot do this.

1864
01:34:30,541 --> 01:34:34,041
He did it.

1865
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:44,375
Aunty! Aunty, where's Ronnie?

1866
01:34:44,875 --> 01:34:46,041
Upstairs.

1867
01:34:46,541 --> 01:34:48,166
Kuku? What's wrong?

1868
01:34:48,666 --> 01:34:52,166
Kuku!

1869
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:58,666
Ronnie.. I'm very sorry, man.

1870
01:34:59,166 --> 01:35:00,625
Sorry? Why are you sorry?

1871
01:35:01,125 --> 01:35:01,958
Well..

1872
01:35:02,458 --> 01:35:03,375
You set our warehouse on fire, didn't you?

1873
01:35:03,875 --> 01:35:05,083
Tell me the truth, you set it on fire, didn't you?

1874
01:35:05,583 --> 01:35:07,041
Yes, but..

1875
01:35:07,541 --> 01:35:10,250
Don't you have any shame?

1876
01:35:10,750 --> 01:35:12,208
If you needed money you should've come to me.

1877
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:14,208
Thief. Why have you come here?

1878
01:35:14,708 --> 01:35:15,958
Grandpa and Himanshu have gone to thrash you.

1879
01:35:16,458 --> 01:35:17,708
You have come here to save yourself. You are doing this drama.

1880
01:35:18,208 --> 01:35:18,916
What are you saying?

1881
01:35:19,416 --> 01:35:20,166
I didn't come here fearing anyone.

1882
01:35:20,666 --> 01:35:23,541
I came here on my own. I was enlightened.

1883
01:35:24,041 --> 01:35:25,791
Damn the enlightenment. Get lost from here.

1884
01:35:26,291 --> 01:35:27,875
He was enlightened.

1885
01:35:28,375 --> 01:35:30,041
Chota flunked in her exams.

1886
01:35:30,541 --> 01:35:32,291
She told me how Prabhakar made her leak the papers..

1887
01:35:32,791 --> 01:35:33,708
She flunked.

1888
01:35:34,208 --> 01:35:35,458
How my father lost his job because of Prabhakar.

1889
01:35:35,958 --> 01:35:37,125
And I ruined my brother's life.

1890
01:35:37,625 --> 01:35:38,458
That's when I was enlightened.

1891
01:35:38,958 --> 01:35:40,833
That's when I realised that I made the same mistake.

1892
01:35:41,333 --> 01:35:43,333
I set my brother's warehouse of fire and started my restaurant.

1893
01:35:43,833 --> 01:35:45,125
I have left my business and came here.

1894
01:35:45,625 --> 01:35:47,291
Please forgive me.

1895
01:35:47,791 --> 01:35:50,833
Wait a minute. - What are you doing?

1896
01:35:51,333 --> 01:35:53,875
Oh damn.

1897
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:56,666
Drive. - Just a minute.

1898
01:35:57,166 --> 01:35:58,583
Yes, Ronnie? - Where are you?

1899
01:35:59,083 --> 01:36:01,125
We are almost there. We are stuck in a traffic jam.

1900
01:36:01,625 --> 01:36:03,250
Don't worry. We won't spare him today.

1901
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:05,625
We'll turn him into a ghost! - You are stuck in traffic jam?

1902
01:36:06,125 --> 01:36:08,041
Saw? They are stuck in traffic jam.

1903
01:36:08,541 --> 01:36:10,041
I didn't come here out of fear. I was enlightened.

1904
01:36:10,541 --> 01:36:13,791
Kuku! That's Kuku's voice. Kuku is in our house!

1905
01:36:14,291 --> 01:36:15,208
Kuku is in our house!

1906
01:36:15,708 --> 01:36:16,833
What are you waiting for? Drive!

1907
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:20,375
Move aside! - Turn the car around!

1908
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:24,375
Please forgive me.

1909
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:30,541
Please forgive me.

1910
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:34,541
I don't have a mother.

1911
01:36:55,083 --> 01:36:56,666
Bunty Rocky come here.

1912
01:36:57,166 --> 01:36:59,458
Come on! - Kuku is here!

1913
01:36:59,958 --> 01:37:03,458
Monu catch him. Sonu take out the hockey.

1914
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:10,625
'The Gulatis wanted to send me to prison but the sage saved me.'

1915
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:14,208
'But he couldn't save everything.'

1916
01:37:14,708 --> 01:37:17,916
'The money papa got from VRS in the morning..'

1917
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:20,166
'We lost in the evening.'

1918
01:37:20,666 --> 01:37:23,708
'We lost my restaurant as well.'

1919
01:37:24,208 --> 01:37:26,166
'Ronnie couldn't do anything to help.'

1920
01:37:26,666 --> 01:37:29,208
'It was my fault.'

1921
01:37:29,708 --> 01:37:32,208
'But one thing was given.'

1922
01:37:32,708 --> 01:37:35,666
'I was not going to spare brother Prabhakar.'

1923
01:37:36,166 --> 01:37:39,666
I won't spare him today!

1924
01:37:41,583 --> 01:37:43,416
Prabhakar?

1925
01:37:43,916 --> 01:37:45,375
What happened?

1926
01:37:45,875 --> 01:37:49,791
It's nothing, uncle. - How did this happen?

1927
01:37:50,291 --> 01:37:52,208
Tell me, what are you wearing?

1928
01:37:52,708 --> 01:37:53,708
Please tell me.

1929
01:37:54,208 --> 01:37:55,458
Wait a second. Who is it?

1930
01:37:55,958 --> 01:37:58,250
I am Prabhakar. - Prabha..

1931
01:37:58,750 --> 01:38:00,458
Same here. How are you, kid?

1932
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:03,125
And I am..

1933
01:38:03,625 --> 01:38:04,291
'What's the solution?'

1934
01:38:04,791 --> 01:38:06,125
'From now his name will be..'

1935
01:38:06,625 --> 01:38:09,208
'I love you, Prabhakar.'

1936
01:38:09,708 --> 01:38:13,208
'Prabhakar's father.'

1937
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:20,875
'Today, after a long time Papa came to our room.'

1938
01:38:21,375 --> 01:38:23,166
'We have never seen him behave like this.'

1939
01:38:23,666 --> 01:38:31,166
'It felt as if we three were missing mom a lot, today.'

1940
01:38:31,666 --> 01:38:35,166
Papa..

1941
01:38:37,041 --> 01:38:40,541
I am sorry, papa.

1942
01:38:45,958 --> 01:38:49,458
All this happened because of me..

1943
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:58,541
Son.. It's neither your fault nor Chota's.

1944
01:38:59,041 --> 01:39:02,250
I, too, got influenced by Prabhakar.

1945
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:06,333
If only I would've believed in you..

1946
01:39:06,833 --> 01:39:10,333
I would've given you money for your restaurant.

1947
01:39:15,291 --> 01:39:19,833
Dad I made a grave mistake.

1948
01:39:20,333 --> 01:39:22,625
I don't know. The sari is so nice.

1949
01:39:23,125 --> 01:39:24,666
Look, this is a perfect match.

1950
01:39:25,166 --> 01:39:26,291
You won't get a better piece.

1951
01:39:26,791 --> 01:39:28,125
This isn't matching either.

1952
01:39:28,625 --> 01:39:30,666
It is an orange sari and you are showing me maroon cut-pieces.

1953
01:39:31,166 --> 01:39:32,041
So much of my time has been wasted.

1954
01:39:32,541 --> 01:39:34,041
I cannot find the right colour.

1955
01:39:34,541 --> 01:39:36,708
Chotu, show them to her. - Show them to me, Chotu.

1956
01:39:37,208 --> 01:39:38,375
Yes, that one.

1957
01:39:38,875 --> 01:39:42,083
You got it. Keep it aside. I'll eat it in some time.

1958
01:39:42,583 --> 01:39:45,166
Eat.

1959
01:39:45,666 --> 01:39:47,541
Who are these guys?

1960
01:39:48,041 --> 01:39:49,125
I don't know.

1961
01:39:49,625 --> 01:39:53,333
Himanshu.

1962
01:39:53,833 --> 01:39:54,666
Yes? What happened?

1963
01:39:55,166 --> 01:39:56,666
Who are these guys? - Insurance guys.

1964
01:39:57,166 --> 01:39:57,500
Insurance?

1965
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,541
They have come to give the insurance money for the warehouse.

1966
01:40:00,041 --> 01:40:00,916
The warehouse was insured?

1967
01:40:01,416 --> 01:40:02,916
Then what! Do you think we are crazy?

1968
01:40:03,416 --> 01:40:05,958
What's for lunch? - Then why did you take money from Kuku?

1969
01:40:06,458 --> 01:40:07,458
Stop chanting Kuku's name!

1970
01:40:07,958 --> 01:40:10,333
Don't take his name in front of me! Mummy, reason it with him.

1971
01:40:10,833 --> 01:40:13,416
Get this straight. We are Gulatis. He burned our warehouse.

1972
01:40:13,916 --> 01:40:14,916
Do you want me to invite him home and feed him?

1973
01:40:15,416 --> 01:40:16,541
Don't we deserve to get even that much?

1974
01:40:17,041 --> 01:40:20,541
Forget the food give him some sense. He has lost his mind.

1975
01:40:23,666 --> 01:40:27,041
Even God would've forgiven that motherless child.

1976
01:40:27,541 --> 01:40:30,541
Everyone knows that he didn't come to us fearing anyone.

1977
01:40:31,041 --> 01:40:33,333
He came on his own, to apologise.

1978
01:40:33,833 --> 01:40:37,791
Ruining all his hard work. To rectify his mistake.

1979
01:40:38,291 --> 01:40:39,958
But why would you forgive him?

1980
01:40:40,458 --> 01:40:42,791
After all you are a Gulati.

1981
01:40:43,291 --> 01:40:47,291
Eat your lunch.

1982
01:40:47,791 --> 01:40:50,416
It's not matching at all. Show it to me. It's not matching.

1983
01:40:50,916 --> 01:40:53,125
I don't know. I have been to so many shops.

1984
01:40:53,625 --> 01:40:55,458
What's happening, Ronnie?

1985
01:40:55,958 --> 01:40:56,875
Aren't you getting any stock?

1986
01:40:57,375 --> 01:40:59,208
You know I need to go for a wedding the day after tomorrow.

1987
01:40:59,708 --> 01:41:00,833
I need to get the blouse stitched from the tailor.

1988
01:41:01,333 --> 01:41:03,250
When will he stitch it? When will I wear it?

1989
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:06,291
This is a matching centre but nothing is matching.

1990
01:41:06,791 --> 01:41:08,041
Tell me something.. - Yes.

1991
01:41:08,541 --> 01:41:09,541
Are they your kids? - Of course they are mine!

1992
01:41:10,041 --> 01:41:13,333
They don't match!

1993
01:41:13,833 --> 01:41:15,458
Damn you to hell! I don't want to buy any blouse!

1994
01:41:15,958 --> 01:41:16,791
I don't want to give you any blouse!

1995
01:41:17,291 --> 01:41:18,041
Leave! - We are leaving!

1996
01:41:18,541 --> 01:41:20,083
First go and check your brains!

1997
01:41:20,583 --> 01:41:24,083
Pack all this.

1998
01:41:32,791 --> 01:41:35,250
Mitali..

1999
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:38,208
I am sorry.

2000
01:41:38,708 --> 01:41:40,916
All this happened and I didn't tell you.

2001
01:41:41,416 --> 01:41:42,916
It's okay, Kuku.

2002
01:41:43,416 --> 01:41:44,833
Everyone makes mistake.

2003
01:41:45,333 --> 01:41:48,166
But it's more important to realise your mistake.

2004
01:41:48,666 --> 01:41:53,875
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

2005
01:41:54,375 --> 01:41:56,583
This one.

2006
01:41:57,083 --> 01:42:00,583
I'll check it.

2007
01:42:06,208 --> 01:42:07,708
Greetings, Mr. Mathur. - Greetings.

2008
01:42:08,208 --> 01:42:09,791
Mr. Mathur, we have come from the sanctuary.

2009
01:42:10,291 --> 01:42:11,958
Yes. - We have a small post-funeral ceremony.

2010
01:42:12,458 --> 01:42:13,166
It is a simple function.

2011
01:42:13,666 --> 01:42:15,208
We need to make arrangements for lunch.

2012
01:42:15,708 --> 01:42:18,166
You can cook any lentil except for pigeon peas.

2013
01:42:18,666 --> 01:42:19,958
Flatbread, a dry vegetable.

2014
01:42:20,458 --> 01:42:22,583
You'll be giving complimentary pickle, right?

2015
01:42:23,083 --> 01:42:23,666
What is this?

2016
01:42:24,166 --> 01:42:28,291
Son, they've come here to give a catering order.

2017
01:42:28,791 --> 01:42:29,583
Yes, son.

2018
01:42:30,083 --> 01:42:32,583
We have come from the sanctuary.

2019
01:42:33,083 --> 01:42:36,541
Mr. Dharshanlal served the sanctuary for 35 years.

2020
01:42:37,041 --> 01:42:37,833
He passed away.

2021
01:42:38,333 --> 01:42:41,416
We have brought his catering list for his ceremony.

2022
01:42:41,916 --> 01:42:43,791
Sorry. We are no longer into this business.

2023
01:42:44,291 --> 01:42:45,500
Come in. - You don't do it?

2024
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:46,791
What are you saying?

2025
01:42:47,291 --> 01:42:48,666
It is a noble deed, please accept the job.

2026
01:42:49,166 --> 01:42:50,583
We don't do catering.

2027
01:42:51,083 --> 01:42:53,458
You don't do catering? Then what do you do?

2028
01:42:53,958 --> 01:42:54,958
I know everything.

2029
01:42:55,458 --> 01:42:57,375
It's all because of the money. - Yes, it's because of money.

2030
01:42:57,875 --> 01:42:59,916
This world is going crazy over money. - Come on, papa.

2031
01:43:00,416 --> 01:43:01,750
They cannot see anything.

2032
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:03,208
Come on, papa. Come inside.

2033
01:43:03,708 --> 01:43:05,166
What are you doing, Kuku? - Oh God!

2034
01:43:05,666 --> 01:43:06,458
So what if we no longer have a restaurant?

2035
01:43:06,958 --> 01:43:08,500
We can get into catering business.

2036
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,166
Opportunity is knocking at our door.

2037
01:43:10,666 --> 01:43:12,375
Mitali, please. You don't know.

2038
01:43:12,875 --> 01:43:13,541
Come on, papa.

2039
01:43:14,041 --> 01:43:19,375
Look, son, your girlfriend is right.

2040
01:43:19,875 --> 01:43:24,708
How can we let go of the opportunity of getting into catering business?

2041
01:43:25,208 --> 01:43:26,583
I don't want to do it!

2042
01:43:27,083 --> 01:43:28,333
But we want to do it!

2043
01:43:28,833 --> 01:43:30,541
Enough! Enough! Enough!

2044
01:43:31,041 --> 01:43:33,291
Goodbye, Mr. Mathur.

2045
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:34,458
Goodbye.

2046
01:43:34,958 --> 01:43:36,583
Your job will be done. - What are you doing?

2047
01:43:37,083 --> 01:43:38,958
That restaurant was mine. You cannot use my name.

2048
01:43:39,458 --> 01:43:40,791
That's great, son!

2049
01:43:41,291 --> 01:43:45,541
You have been using my name since the past 19 years.

2050
01:43:46,041 --> 01:43:48,541
Did I ever object to that?

2051
01:43:49,041 --> 01:43:53,333
Mathur, the father, was born before the son.

2052
01:43:53,833 --> 01:44:01,125
Got it? - And then Ronnie Gulati was born.

2053
01:44:01,625 --> 01:44:05,125
Fruit beer?

2054
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:25,291
I know why you are here.

2055
01:44:25,791 --> 01:44:31,208
Tell grandpa I'll anyhow repay the balance in4-5 months.

2056
01:44:31,708 --> 01:44:33,791
Don't worry.

2057
01:44:34,291 --> 01:44:35,333
Have you lost your mind, Kuku?

2058
01:44:35,833 --> 01:44:37,458
You think I am here for the money?

2059
01:44:37,958 --> 01:44:40,083
There is a vast difference between me and Himanshu.

2060
01:44:40,583 --> 01:44:41,833
I had come here to give this to you.

2061
01:44:42,333 --> 01:44:43,541
What's this?

2062
01:44:44,041 --> 01:44:46,041
Kuku and Ronnie Catering services.

2063
01:44:46,541 --> 01:44:49,083
I have been working on it since so many days.

2064
01:44:49,583 --> 01:44:52,166
And what were you thinking!

2065
01:44:52,666 --> 01:44:55,041
I had to face uncle.

2066
01:44:55,541 --> 01:44:58,250
When I came to know that grandpa is going to get the insurance money..

2067
01:44:58,750 --> 01:45:00,791
And he took uncle's VRS's money..

2068
01:45:01,291 --> 01:45:04,166
I too got that.. Enlightenment.

2069
01:45:04,666 --> 01:45:06,208
That grandpa is not always right.

2070
01:45:06,708 --> 01:45:10,625
I fought with him and asked for my rightful share.

2071
01:45:11,125 --> 01:45:13,416
We have always been together.

2072
01:45:13,916 --> 01:45:15,500
So, we will do the business together.

2073
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,458
Kuku and Ronnie Catering services.

2074
01:45:20,958 --> 01:45:22,583
I am a Gulati.

2075
01:45:23,083 --> 01:45:26,583
But I am your friend.

2076
01:45:32,250 --> 01:45:35,666
You will fight with your grandfather and help me?

2077
01:45:36,166 --> 01:45:38,125
Why?

2078
01:45:38,625 --> 01:45:42,125
Because you don't have a mother.

2079
01:45:48,625 --> 01:45:50,208
"In the stir-fried lentils.."

2080
01:45:50,708 --> 01:45:52,333
"In boiling potatoes.."

2081
01:45:52,833 --> 01:45:56,458
"In the spice mix.."

2082
01:45:56,958 --> 01:45:58,541
"In a sari's fall.."

2083
01:45:59,041 --> 01:46:00,625
"In female company.."

2084
01:46:01,125 --> 01:46:04,833
"Under Shabho's skin.."

2085
01:46:05,333 --> 01:46:06,875
"In good times.."

2086
01:46:07,375 --> 01:46:10,875
"I am in a soup."

2087
01:46:13,083 --> 01:46:15,000
"With me I have.."

2088
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:17,041
"I have our treasured friendship!"

2089
01:46:17,541 --> 01:46:19,208
"With me I have.."

2090
01:46:19,708 --> 01:46:21,041
"I have our treasured friendship!"

2091
01:46:21,541 --> 01:46:23,416
"With me I have.."

2092
01:46:23,916 --> 01:46:25,458
"I have our treasured friendship!"

2093
01:46:25,958 --> 01:46:27,541
"With me I have.."

2094
01:46:28,041 --> 01:46:31,541
"I have our treasured friendship!"

2095
01:46:42,458 --> 01:46:44,583
What are you making? It smells great.

2096
01:46:45,083 --> 01:46:47,208
Smells great? I am boiling water.

2097
01:46:47,708 --> 01:46:50,625
Anything you make smells great.

2098
01:46:51,125 --> 01:46:51,791
Hey! Naughty!

2099
01:46:52,291 --> 01:46:55,791
What happened! I am married to you! It's not a joke!

2100
01:47:03,375 --> 01:47:06,791
"My life is a lie. My death is a lie."

2101
01:47:07,291 --> 01:47:09,208
"My life and death.."

2102
01:47:09,708 --> 01:47:13,333
"Life.."

2103
01:47:13,833 --> 01:47:15,416
"With me I have.."

2104
01:47:15,916 --> 01:47:17,500
"I have our treasured friendship!"

2105
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,708
