1
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33.020
Hey!

2
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36.140
Get my phone.

3
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40.000
They have provided self-help books
to the students taking the exam.

4
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:41.110
Sir.

5
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:44.250
The students are worried about
how the test will be.

6
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57.360
We are worried about
what the questions will be.

7
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58.570
Sandhya...

8
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00.740
Get me some chilled water.

9
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06.270
 We will try our level best... 

10
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07.400
Has she gone deaf?

11
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21.970
She can't even get me a glass of water!

12
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29.260
Lazy woman!

13
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40.810
- What?
- Sir, parcel.

14
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42.600
- Sign here.
- Give me a pen.

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44.000
I don't have a pen.

16
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45.540
- You don't have a pen?
- No.

17
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47.040
What's wrong with everyone?

18
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45.610
 Victory to Arun Gawli! 

19
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:48.390
Victory to Arun Gawli!

20
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:51.210
Victory to Arun Gawli!

21
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:56.040
Former Mafia don Arun Gulab Gawli is
fondly called "Daddy" these days.

22
00:03:56,084 --> 00:03:58.120
He is now a changed man.

23
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:02.180
He takes his political campaign seriously,
by focusing on helping the poor...

24
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04.540
... with medicines, electricity,
and water.

25
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08.250
Now we have drinking water, not
the many problems with water like before.

26
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:10.360
Now we have a garden to play in.

27
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13.360
It has new swings
and it's fun to play there.

28
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15.930
- Tell me more, dear.
- He built a gym in the school.

29
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18.970
We also have uniforms, notebooks,
and lunch at school now.

30
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21.550
Do we have to give him
police protection now?

31
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26.780
They've turned him into a hero.

32
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31.020
People used to be terrified
to enter the Dagdi Chawl...

33
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35.000
...but today he is looked up to
and compared to Robin Hood. Suddenly...

34
00:04:35,084 --> 00:04:37.870
Geeta, I don't know who Robin Hood is.

35
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41.667
He is a thief, but not a villain.

36
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44.860
He takes from the rich
and gives it to the poor.

37
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51.520
That's good.

38
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03.875
The residents here are
very happy with him...

39
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07.050
...and they are praying
that he wins in the next elections.

40
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10.090
Open all his old cases.

41
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13.330
Do you remember Vijaykar?

42
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15.600
He's been after him since 1986.

43
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19.090
We have even held back his retirement.

44
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22.670
He must be remembering
the numbers of old cases too.

45
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30.120
There's one thing in life
that's very rare...

46
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33.260
...an opportunity.

47
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37.110
Your entire life can pass by
in search of that one chance.

48
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43.960
I felt as if my life had passed by too.

49
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48.820
But there it was again...
...an opportunity.

50
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51.210
How many people were there?

51
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54.140
Two, sir.

52
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57.260
Two.

53
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00.690
Did you see the shooter?

54
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03.350
No, sir.

55
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06.280
Why?

56
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19.090
Someone shot MLA Mhatre.
This is a big case.

57
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23.510
- Tambe...
- Yes, sir.

58
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26.780
I think it's him.

59
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30.150
It's him.

60
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35.150
It's him.

61
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01.140
Hello, ma'am!

62
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03.040
I've got pedha for you.

63
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05.520
You like pedha, don't you?

64
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08.180
Have some sweets.

65
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18.750
So, where's the leader of the nation?

66
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23.110
What did he do now?

67
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25.240
You want to know what he did.

68
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26.890
What has he not done?

69
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:33.110
He started with extortion,
moved to gambling, robbery, smuggling...

70
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34.550
...and then murder.

71
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40.010
Your son will soon go in
for a long vacation!

72
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44.360
He doesn't owe you anything.

73
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48.060
So, why can't you leave him alone?

74
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52.330
That's exactly what
I'm trying to figure out.

75
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54.880
He's not even letting me retire in peace.

76
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00.740
He thinks that he can become a Gandhi
merely by wearing a Gandhi cap.

77
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03.800
He became what he had to.

78
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10.190
I don't know whether it
was bad luck or bad influence.

79
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13.710
But the worst thing
in his life was poverty.

80
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17.600
There's no smoke without fire.

81
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19.700
There's a strike.

82
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:21.260
No one will work today.

83
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25.270
Stop working, everyone. Stop everything.

84
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28.709
- I've got lunch for my father.
- Forget his lunch... Get lost.

85
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29.800
No one will work.

86
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32.740
He hasn't eaten since morning.

87
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35.860
Hey boy! I'll have to knock
some sense into you.

88
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:37.210
Who are you calling 'boy'?

89
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44.850
You cannot understand the plight
of a mill worker's son.

90
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49.720
Go ask about the 200,000 workers
who lost their jobs.

91
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53.450
Go and ask what happened
to their children.

92
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00.360
- Babu, you're cheating again.
- Come on, play.

93
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01.900
Put that coin back.

94
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03.730
Will you play or not?

95
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05.690
I won't play if you cheat.

96
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09.100
- You play, Rama!
- Let it be.

97
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10.930
Where are you going?

98
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12.860
Sit.

99
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14.650
Play with Rama.

100
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27.530
Play.

101
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33.490
Don't show me your teeth.

102
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35.730
You should have seen the other guy's face.

103
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38.480
Once again...
...you danced to their tunes.

104
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40.210
You don't get it.

105
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42.850
You must get them
to dance to your tunes.

106
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46.110
Do you want ice cream?
Uma will get some for us.

107
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47.200
Uma, come here.

108
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52.140
Tell him about Parsiya's
famous ice cream parlor.

109
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56.960
Why go there now?

110
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:02.690
Well, Parsiya opens
his gambling parlor at 9 a.m. ...

111
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04.330
...and closes by 8 p.m.

112
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08.390
When you enter, you'll see the manager.
I'll be sitting next to him.

113
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12.880
- I'll sit there and...
- "Here she comes, my friends..."

114
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15.090
Rama, please don't do this...

115
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17.930
"Her veil is a curtain. She pretends..."

116
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19.560
Hey! Shut up!

117
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21.110
Why the hell are singing?

118
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24.540
Can't you see who's behind the veil?
Haven't you seen a girl before?

119
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26.600
Why do you stare at me
that way every day?

120
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28.320
- She's angry!
- What?! Come!

121
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30.580
Come here! Talk to me.

122
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32.320
I wasn't the one singing.

123
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37.970
I like you!

124
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46.210
Why don't you show such courage...

125
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:48.110
...in front of those union leaders?

126
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50.840
After seeing her, I miss Hilda.

127
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54.240
I need to visit the barber, and then
I'll meet Hilda. I have to go.

128
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57.210
Aren't you getting married
to another girl?

129
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59.080
My mother wouldn't like Hilda...

130
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01.370
...and I can't break my mother's heart.

131
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05.370
- Shall I call her out again?
- Get lost!

132
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44.580
Hey. Don't you like me?

133
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51.070
People say you're involved
in dishonest work.

134
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53.620
What are you trying to say?

135
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54.830
What do you do?

136
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02.080
I'm in the import and export business.

137
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05.390
Really? Import and export!

138
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08.710
Why don't you import something
so that she can export?

139
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:09.950
Stupid fellow!

140
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12.040
Shut up!
Hilda, stop his mouth.

141
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13.210
Hold this.

142
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16.230
The balcony is empty
if want some privacy.

143
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18.330
Come, I'II bring you home.

144
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23.370
"They didn't really want
to get into fights."

145
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26.520
"They just wanted to have a good time."

146
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27.620
"Oh, really?"

147
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:31.140
"Why were they constantly visiting
Parsiya's gambling parlor?"

148
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32.590
Who knows what to do?

149
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35.110
Do you see the open door?
We have to go in there.

150
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36.650
- Is this the one?
- Yes.

151
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39.200
Arun, you handle two of them.
Babu, you handle the other two.

152
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40.690
Vijay, you...

153
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42.860
What if there are more than two to handle?

154
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44.880
How do you know
how many men are inside?

155
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50.250
Vijay, go and get a count.

156
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53.810
Why me? They will see my face...

157
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56.690
Blackie, the whole
of India looks like you.

158
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58.840
- No one will notice you. Go.
- Come on, go.

159
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03.190
Be careful.

160
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35.030
Run!

161
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42.240
Damn it!

162
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44.340
What are you doing?

163
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49.760
Damn!

164
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53.440
Arun!

165
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54.830
Let's go!

166
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06.920
He stole from a thief.

167
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11.900
He didn't just steal... He murdered.

168
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14.490
Shall I remind you?

169
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16.540
Arun had nothing to do with it.

170
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20.540
It was all done by that smuggler
Babu Resham.

171
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24.490
Arun, what place is this?

172
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27.650
You asked me where I work,
so today I'm showing it to you.

173
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30.120
Hey, Babu.

174
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34.120
Here.

175
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39.950
He's a stupid fellow!

176
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45.390
This is the key to Babu's vault.

177
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54.520
What happened?

178
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56.260
Nothing.

179
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02.230
What's all this, Arun?

180
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03.910
These are imported items.

181
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07.600
VHS...

182
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09.720
It must be expensive.

183
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11.740
No one's asking you for money.

184
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16.980
Take it.

185
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21.580
Take whatever you like.

186
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31.600
Arun, let's go.

187
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35.770
Hold on...
I said you don't have to pay me.

188
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39.180
Didn't I say it's for free?

189
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23.690
- What is it?
- There's a big problem.

190
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28.120
I'II be back, Mom.

191
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30.340
What happened?

192
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32.160
Parsiya killed Uma.

193
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42.390
"They never imagined that Parsiya
would kill Rama's brother Uma."

194
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49.460
Let's go take revenge!

195
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50.880
Have you lost your mind?

196
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54.340
- Rama, let's go to the police.
- He was my brother.

197
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58.240
Come on, Babu.
I told you he's a damn coward!

198
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59.300
Come on!

199
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01.570
- Come on, Babu!
- Hey, Rama. Rama.

200
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03.040
- You're not coming?
- Let go.

201
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04.859
- What do you mean, dog?
- Let go of me.

202
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06.730
- Are you coming or not?
- No, I'm not.

203
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09.560
What do you mean?
Are you going to go and salute the cops?

204
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12.749
When you needed us,
we were there for you, Arun.

205
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15.450
Don't ever show your face
around us, a**hole.

206
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19.340
Rama!

207
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26.579
What's wrong with you, man?

208
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28.380
Let's go.

209
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57.430
Hold it.

210
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18.440
You motherf***er! Move back!

211
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21.420
Kill him! Kill him!

212
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23.790
Let's go... Let's go...

213
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25.340
Hey... No!

214
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28.230
Let go of me. Let go of me.

215
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56.620
Who in God's name is it?

216
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59.190
- What is it?
- Where is Arun?

217
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01.050
- Where's Arun?
- What are you doing?

218
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03.560
Get up! Get up!

219
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06.760
- What have you done now?
- I didn't do anything!

220
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09.090
Get up!
You didn't do anything?!

221
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11.420
- Come to the police station!
- Leave him!

222
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14.080
- Leave me!
- Come on, you filthy scum.

223
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23.640
Let him go!

224
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:30.640
Get inside!
That's enough drama for one day.

225
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42.820
Did you see how they
dragged him to the van?

226
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44.140
He has lost all respect!

227
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48.560
We belong to different communities
and so our lifestyles differ.

228
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51.510
Zubeida, you won't say anything now.

229
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54.390
Come with me to the village.

230
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24.170
Do you recognize him?

231
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26.820
Have you seen him before?

232
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30.280
Have a look at him. Do you recognize him?

233
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33.090
- Have you seen him?
- No.

234
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36.030
Have you ever seen him?

235
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38.170
Have you seen him?

236
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40.800
Hey... I'm asking you.

237
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:43.870
Have you seen him?

238
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46.570
Have you seen him?

239
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48.070
Have you seen him?

240
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50.560
Speak up.

241
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39.250
Are you enjoying getting drenched?
Come on, get in.

242
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55.220
Here. Have some Vadapav.

243
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57.390
Take it.

244
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00.510
Take it.

245
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06.730
Finally, he is one of us now.

246
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07.820
Forget it.

247
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09.940
I have Lord Shiva's blessings with me.

248
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14.630
Not even one person recognized me.

249
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16.190
Isn't it a miracle?

250
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18.150
Idiot, that was no miracle!

251
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21.880
You have the don's support.

252
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24.850
Got it? It's the don.

253
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27.870
Don't ever forget his favor.

254
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31.890
Don rules Dongri these days.

255
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37.150
At his command, everybody
refused to recognize you.

256
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40.580
Babu's connected with him.

257
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54.770
He said he will meet on Friday.

258
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58.570
Okay. You'll meet my henchman
after Friday's prayers...

259
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01.820
- ...near Musafirkhana's poultry farm.
- Greetings, Rafique.

260
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04.010
How are you, Babu?
Have a seat. Have a seat!

261
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05.910
So... What was I saying?

262
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09.510
Friday, after prayers.

263
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12.560
And it mustn't be postponed
until Saturday, get it?

264
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14.240
- Good bye.
- Watch out!

265
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15.810
Sorry...sorry!

266
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:17.990
It's an old and unique piece.

267
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20.940
In our line of business,
always keep your eyes open.

268
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23.180
- I didn't see it.
- Have a seat.

269
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24.560
You sit there.

270
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30.580
- Behave yourself.
- It wasn't me.

271
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46.730
Alright. Did the angels give you a tip?

272
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51.870
Yes, place the bet.

273
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55.650
Okay. Alright.

274
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06.460
Do you know who he is?

275
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09.140
Bump him off!

276
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12.950
- This guy?
- Yes.

277
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15.930
Samad Khan.

278
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21.000
He is a Pathan.

279
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24.670
He is ruthless.

280
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28.800
I told the don
all about your act of bravado.

281
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36.870
He has all the details of
the Parsiya murder case too.

282
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41.770
Bet 2 million on Midget's Century.

283
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45.020
When?

284
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49.430
We'll tell you.

285
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52.880
If you're caught, you're on your own.

286
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55.880
We won't come to rescue you this time.

287
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01.040
Have you ever used an English weapon?

288
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05.570
- We'll use it.
- That's good.

289
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09.660
You may come here to get
10000 rupees after you finish the job.

290
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14.560
But we haven't discussed
the money yet.

291
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18.550
We'll discuss it
once the job's done.

292
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24.930
You're the first man who's ever...

293
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27.540
10,000 rupees is more than enough.
It will be done.

294
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32.790
We are taking on the Pathans...

295
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36.940
...for the sake of friendship.

296
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40.370
We'll talk once the job's done.

297
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50.230
Have you lost it?

298
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09.100
It seems the don is in a good mood.

299
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13.480
He gives his word.

300
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17.000
Get Samad killed,,,
Then we can talk about it.

301
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48.350
Samad, won't you say goodbye?

302
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50.780
Bye.

303
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52.450
- Leave him!
- Kill him!

304
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30.480
I didn't see anything.

305
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34.380
Yes, I had an affair with Babu.

306
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:40.300
He even asked me to leave town with him.

307
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42.430
I refused to go.

308
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45.560
You see, I come from a good background!

309
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52.310
I want to know the details of the murder.

310
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53.380
Come...

311
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55.310
Give me the names.

312
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06.200
Listen... Come on... Talk.

313
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11.680
You wanted a new beginning, didn't you?

314
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16.370
Take some money
and make a new beginning.

315
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18.410
That would be good for you.

316
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28.340
After they killed Samad...

317
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30.850
...the don kept his word.

318
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33.750
In fact he even offered friendship.

319
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37.310
- Greetings.
- Yes!

320
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39.880
- The don sent it for you.
- Okay.

321
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42.350
Goodbye.

322
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52.310
I love the don's style.

323
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55.030
'Samad Khan's Brutal Murder'

324
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56.240
Check this out, Rama.

325
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00.450
Babu... Rama...

326
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02.990
Arun.

327
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06.050
B.R.A. Gang.

328
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08.140
What about me?

329
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10.670
What about you?

330
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:14.490
You went there to kill him,
but you got battered yourself.

331
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18.950
Does anyone have any objection?

332
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32.440
Hurry up!

333
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:35.930
Come on!

334
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38.480
Do it properly.

335
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45.310
Come on.

336
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54.500
Give Maqsood his money back.

337
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58.850
I don't want to work under anybody.

338
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02.950
So what do you want to do?
Become a businessman like Tata or Birla?

339
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06.630
If I work here in this line,
I need to be an equal.

340
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:08.950
Look, Babu...

341
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11.420
The dockyard area belongs to us.

342
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13.170
We must get a share in it.

343
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16.590
Think about it

344
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19.740
The docks will belong to you
and we will rule over Agripada.

345
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24.210
You speak to Rama.

346
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27.010
I'll make him understand.

347
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33.340
Who will talk to the don?

348
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51.150
Don.

349
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00.540
What does he put in
this custard ice cream?

350
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04.990
He has never told this to anybody
outside his family.

351
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08.490
He refused me twice.

352
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12.370
Don, would you like some more?

353
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14.670
That's enough.

354
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18.500
How much can I eat?

355
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:33.220
Forget it, Arun.
The don said he'll think about it.

356
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38.960
Maqsood has bought both
Poonam International and Caesar's Palace.

357
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40.390
And we...

358
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45.040
...we are doing his big jobs
for loose change.

359
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:51.530
It hurts me to give him such a big share.

360
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55.670
If you want to be around for long,
learn to be patient.

361
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58.900
The higher you fly, the harder the fall.

362
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00.430
And hurt your ass!

363
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:07.550
It's time you settle down. Get married.

364
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12.159
You aren't earning a penny,
yet you're getting married.

365
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20.090
I'm done. So long.

366
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22.230
- Wait! Where are you going?
- See you.

367
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:23.930
Idiot!

368
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26.429
Who was Hilda?

369
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27.530
My friend.

370
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30.300
Hilda was crazy about Arun.

371
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33.080
 But Arun loved Zubeida. 

372
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35.940
So Hilda settled for Rama instead.

373
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43.880
"I am with the one who I love."

374
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46.779
"I killed two birds with one stone."

375
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:52.179
"The sparrow in my neighborhood
started dancing to my tunes."

376
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55.090
"She started dancing to my tunes."

377
00:34:55,180 --> 00:35:00.710
"I have a new parrot here
and he is amazed by her."

378
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:06.660
"I have a new parrot here
and he is amazed by her."

379
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18.900
Rama married the woman
his mother chose...

380
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22.290
 but celebrated his wedding night
with Hilda. 

381
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26.030
Why are you shouting?

382
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29.160
Rama, let's go.

383
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32.630
"She started dancing to my tunes."

384
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38.580
Hey... What are you doing here?

385
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42.560
- Rama...?
- No, no. Go down.

386
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44.960
He's decorating the place for you.

387
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48.930
Go back down... I'll call you.

388
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54.680
They were like wild horses.

389
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58.910
They had made a gang
but they weren't capable of managing it.

390
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02.120
And one day Babu showed us
what a beast he was.

391
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04.090
Babu, open the door.

392
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06.470
Nothing will happen to you.
What can even happen?

393
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08.960
Dammit!

394
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10.740
Quiet!

395
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13.730
Are you going to open the door
or must I call the police?

396
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14.810
What is it?

397
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16.650
Open the door now!

398
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17.980
What's the matter?

399
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19.650
Have you lost your mind?

400
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20.740
Don't go inside.

401
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23.440
- What? Call the police?
- Have you lost your mind?

402
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25.310
You're drunk.
Don't make a scene!

403
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:28.410
- Stop! What are you doing?
- Don't touch me!

404
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31.070
You're call the police?

405
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32.850
You'll call the police?!

406
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35.850
- Let go of me!
- My name is Babu!

407
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39.580
- You think you can have me arrested?
- Let go of her!

408
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42.100
Babu, let go of her!

409
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59.580
It hurts.

410
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:09.290
It's chilled.

411
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21.640
He can't hold his drink.

412
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27.260
So...?

413
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35.450
You called the cops!

414
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46.830
You did the right thing.

415
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53.270
What he didn't learn outside,
maybe he'll learn it in jail.

416
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35.530
What was that?

417
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37.390
Who is it?

418
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39.500
Who is it?

419
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53.960
They sent you to get me out of here?

420
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00.520
Couldn't you have told me, you bastard?

421
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04.250
You shot me! Damn you!

422
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06.400
Anyone could've killed him.

423
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08.390
I'll deal with you once I'm out of jail.

424
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12.210
But he was killed
by his childhood friend.

425
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14.260
Damn you!

426
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37.680
And so Babu became history.

427
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:59.040
They went to the police station
with bombs and weapons...

428
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00.720
...in order to kill him.

429
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04.300
Who did that, Don?

430
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08.970
You could blame a woman's curse for that.

431
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14.920
A leaf falls in this city
and you know about it.

432
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28.590
They don't want money, they want a share.
They need to know who did this.

433
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:35.530
Just think...
What person didn't turn up at his funeral?

434
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:39.890
Did Vijay do this?

435
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42.280
Where is he?

436
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48.270
Who did it? Where can we find him?

437
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52.000
- Tell them one last time, Rafique.
- Yes.

438
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:56.490
If you want to be my equal,
learn to find information for yourself.

439
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59.630
- Out of the way.
- Do you understand?

440
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04.570
You don't earn a reputation
just by wearing high heels.

441
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:18.370
"The weather is romantic
and we should grab the opportunity."

442
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20.790
Whether you like it or not...

443
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24.380
...one day everyone ends up
working for the don.

444
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29.460
You know that, sir, don't you?

445
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36.960
But Gawli...
He was a whole different breed.

446
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:47.520
Dear audience,
we're taking you to the moon today.

447
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:52.540
Here's our rocket.

448
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:00.770
And from this rocket, a beautiful girl...

449
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:06.400
...will land on the moon with her lover...

450
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:11.390
...and dance to celebrate her love.

451
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:21.090
"Hey, darling, I want to dance with you."

452
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23.040
Dance...

453
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25.190
Dance of Love.

454
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:28.640
Dance on the moon.

455
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:53.200
"My life is full of dance...dance."

456
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:57.740
"Devotion is my dance...dance."

457
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:02.300
"My happiness lies in dance...dance."

458
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:07.150
"I lose my senses when I dance...dance."

459
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:15.830
"My body is for dance...dance."

460
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20.320
"My love is only for dance...dance."

461
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:24.840
"My beloved is dance...dance."

462
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29.630
"My love is for dance...dance."

463
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:38.590
And now, I'll take you to another world.

464
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41.390
- Venus.
- Venus?

465
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43.480
"Eight... Seven..."

466
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45.930
"Six... Five..."

467
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47.810
"Four... Three..."

468
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50.050
"Two... One..."

469
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54.300
"Venus! We are Venus..."

470
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:58.880
"Venus! We are Venus..."

471
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:08.720
"Touch my body with your breath."

472
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:12.530
"Seal my lips with yours."

473
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:17.550
"When you peer into my eyes"

474
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21.490
"I forget every other thing in the world."

475
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:26.100
"My life is full of dance...dance."

476
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:30.570
"My devotion is dance...dance."

477
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:35.140
"My body is for dance...dance."

478
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:40.260
"My love is only for dance...dance."

479
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45.350
Darling, let's go to another world.

480
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47.900
- Mars.
- Let's go.

481
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00.260
He does that every day.

482
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02.080
Here... Take this.

483
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05.140
Tell Pappu that he is getting too greedy.

484
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07.320
- Okay.
- I'll knock some sense into him.

485
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08.730
- Get going now.
- Okay.

486
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:11.790
Goodbye, boss.

487
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:21.410
Hey, Vijay.

488
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32.850
Where were you last Monday?

489
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41.820
You black dog!

490
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54.410
You guys consider yourself
gangsters, don't you?

491
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59.440
Babu had become too arrogant.

492
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:04.010
But he started crying like a baby
 when I shot him...

493
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05.890
...the bloody pig!

494
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10.180
If he were alive,
I would kill him the same way.

495
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:13.320
- F***ing bastard!
- Hit me... Hit me!

496
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:15.140
F***ing junkie.

497
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17.080
Shoot him.

498
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31.820
So you're going to shoot me, you coward?

499
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33.500
I've seen you.

500
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06.500
Damn you!

501
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:08.410
Rama, let's go!

502
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15.470
Ask your men to leave. Do it!

503
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19.010
Move back, or else I will kill him!

504
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:20.140
Move back!

505
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:22.990
Arun, let's go!

506
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30.530
Who sent you?

507
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32.890
Hey! Who sent you here?

508
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35.810
Hey! Did Maqsood send you?

509
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40.890
- Arun, let him go.
- You bastard!

510
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:43.770
Arun, let him go! Run!

511
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52.680
It still hurts, doesn't it?

512
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02.890
So why didn't you arrest
Arun for Vijay's murder?

513
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06.240
Why did you declare that he
died in the police encounter?

514
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:13.090
I knew...
...that you wanted a promotion.

515
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:16.440
I didn't say a word either.

516
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22.320
You can trust me.

517
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:40.460
They knew it wasn't going to be
easy to fight Maqsood without any support.

518
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:45.230
Only one man could
get them out of this mess.

519
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:47.530
Ashok Joshi.

520
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:53.610
It's so peaceful out here.

521
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54.700
Hey, Gauri!

522
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58.600
Did you inject the medicine into
Kaushalya? She has a fever.

523
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59.730
Yes, I did.

524
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:04.710
So...why have you come here?

525
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09.070
- Mr. Joshi, why don't you...
- Rama!

526
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:11.600
I've already told you...

527
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14.020
...that I'm not coming back.

528
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17.170
I'm not getting into that mess again.

529
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22.950
I have weapons and I have shooters too.

530
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27.460
They both are my trustworthy henchmen.

531
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29.020
Sada.

532
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34.140
He prefers local guns
to the automatic ones...

533
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:36.970
...because they never jam.

534
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:40.990
Newman.

535
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:45.160
He used to work for Maqsood.

536
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:48.490
Maqsood would give him all the big hits.

537
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:51.780
He knew all his secrets...

538
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57.010
...so they chopped off his tongue.

539
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:13.000
You need to oil the weapons...
...not just look after the buffaloes.

540
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16.110
Everyone forgets the past...

541
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20.920
...and with each passing day,
Gawli is erasing all the evidence.

542
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:27.810
But I remember everything, sir...

543
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29.190
...like yesterday.

544
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34.070
I know the rest of the story.

545
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:37.230
Now do one thing...

546
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40.360
Testify against Arun.

547
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:46.430
You will be safe.
I will see to it.

548
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:54.350
But... You will have
to stay with us for a while.

549
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:56.660
Police protection.

550
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:04.870
Have a look at this, sir.

551
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:07.420
Documents never lie.

552
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12.310
Sir, there's a call for you.

553
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16.960
Hello.

554
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:46.590
Sit.

555
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:58.590
If Arun learns of this meeting...

556
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01.480
...he will never speak to me again.

557
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04.550
And you know what will happen to you.

558
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05.980
Stop this nonsense.

559
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:10.250
You dared to call me here...

560
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13.860
...because an arrest warrant
for him will be issued next week.

561
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18.220
You really hate him, don't you?

562
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:21.020
You two are old enemies.

563
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24.400
The truth is, he is just like you.

564
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:29.520
Had he been born in your family,
he would have been a cop.

565
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:32.850
And if you had been born in Dagdi,
you would be a gangster.

566
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:56.150
How are you?

567
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03.520
What are you doing here?

568
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:07.680
Making some tea. Would you like some?

569
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:22.990
Dad arranged a marriage for me.

570
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27.100
The wedding was to take place yesterday...
...but I ran away.

571
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31.710
What are you saying?

572
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33.700
Why?

573
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38.760
- What do you think the reason could be?
- What?

574
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:42.790
For you.

575
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51.880
Will you marry me?

576
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15.080
So, that's done.

577
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19.600
No one in your family came.

578
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25.510
I don't see anyone either.

579
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28.810
Then, who's the witness to our marriage?

580
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:30.180
Huh?

581
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:33.080
There was a long line
for the sweets and garlands.

582
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34.940
- I had to wait forever.
- There he is.

583
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:36.180
- He?
- Here you are.

584
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37.990
I don't trust this man one bit.

585
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40.820
Hey! You won't find another man like me.

586
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44.270
I am the guest of honor today. Get it?

587
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:47.300
- Come on.
- Listen, your stay has been arranged.

588
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:50.020
What? Aren't we going to your house?

589
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53.530
That will take some time.

590
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:55.440
Mom won't understand.

591
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:58.480
- Here, have some sweets.
- I had sweets last night.

592
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:01.260
- Come on...
- Have some. Don't be stubborn.

593
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:02.810
- Have some
- Let me feed you.

594
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:04.980
Here, this is for you.

595
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07.640
Open it.

596
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:11.950
What is it?

597
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15.470
Look after your own things
and life will be blissful.

598
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:21.840
Whose house is it?

599
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23.660
It belongs to a friend.

600
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:27.480
- Enjoy. Be a man.
- Stop it!

601
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:29.170
Where's the owner of the house?

602
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32.760
He won't return anytime soon.
He's behind bars... Careful!

603
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51.270
You're scared of a rat!

604
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:55.690
Rama!

605
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04.680
Greetings.

606
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11.810
Arun, have a look at this.

607
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:19.070
- Who sent this?
- That...

608
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:21.020
Have you told anyone about our wedding?

609
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22.110
No.

610
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24.200
'Congratulations on your wedding
Don'

611
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:27.370
What's the matter?

612
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:36.320
Arun left Maqsood's company,
but Maqsood didn't leave Arun.

613
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39.760
We never felt as if we were alone.

614
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55.130
And Arun had picked up a bad habit.

615
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:03.340
Have you gone mad? Huh?

616
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:07.390
He killed Babu, tried to kill us,
and you want to negotiate with him!

617
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:10.820
You go be his slave if you want to.
Just don't drag me into it.

618
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13.340
What? What did you say?

619
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:17.810
Don't talk nonsense.
What will you do without him?

620
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:20.810
Rama, we'll do what we are doing.

621
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:22.970
What are we doing? We're doing nothing!

622
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:26.780
Don't you want to be successful like him?

623
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:30.100
That's your problem. You ignore
whatever you don't want to hear.

624
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:31.690
I don't want to hear anything.

625
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:34.940
Just do as you're told.

626
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37.800
I'II pick you up tomorrow.

627
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58.620
Arun, tomorrow is Eid.

628
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01.110
Don't go anywhere tomorrow.
Okay?

629
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:06.470
It's our first Eid together.
I have called family members here.

630
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07.680
I know.

631
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:17.860
God is great.

632
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25.200
Arun!

633
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:29.270
Arun?

634
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:39.660
That year on Eid, I realized
even gangsters have some cardinal rules.

635
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:44.170
One: On the festival, everybody meets
like friends to try to settle differences.

636
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:47.620
Two: Nobody touches family.

637
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:51.010
"On the day of Eid..."

638
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:57.760
"...even enemies greet each other."

639
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:06.700
"No matter how severe the enmity is..."

640
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:13.320
"...everyone forgets their differences
on the day of Eid."

641
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:30.760
"We wish you a happy Eid.
It's time to celebrate."

642
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:35.410
"We wish you a happy Eid.
We wish everyone a happy Eid."

643
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:38.710
Hi, Arun.

644
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41.650
Happy Eid.

645
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43.860
- Happy Eid.
- Happy Eid.

646
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:46.970
Give my regards to Zubeida.

647
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:51.800
"We wish you a happy Eid.
It's time to celebrate."

648
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:56.420
"We wish you a happy Eid.
We wish everyone a happy Eid."

649
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06.880
Now listen to me carefully...

650
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:11.860
There's nothing left
in extortion anymore.

651
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:13.780
All we get is loose change.

652
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15.970
But we can earn a lot
with cocaine.

653
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24.190
As you wish, Don.

654
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28.350
You see, we're going to
open a college in Mira Road...

655
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:30.270
...for the Nigerians.

656
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:33.720
That will make it easier for us
to supply drugs. Hm?

657
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:37.890
The goods are mine
and I will see how to get it supplied.

658
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:41.940
You guys open up the docks
in your area.

659
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:43.210
You'll get a 25% share.

660
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47.940
Parekh, did you
see the building plan?

661
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:50.800
Everything is on track, Don.

662
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:52.640
The work is going ahead full speed.

663
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03.520
So tell me, Rama.

664
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:10.460
"Eid is the most
blissful day of the year."

665
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:13.300
Look, friendship does matter...

666
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:18.170
...but there must be only one leader.

667
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:20.890
"We wish you a happy Eid.
It's time to celebrate."

668
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:23.510
Done!

669
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28.690
"This is the day to celebrate.
This is the night to celebrate."

670
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:33.070
"Everyone is meeting their friends."

671
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:34.270
My hands are dirty.

672
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39.420
"We wish you a happy Eid.
We wish everyone a happy Eid."

673
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:43.080
"We wish you a happy Eid.
It's time to celebrate."

674
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:46.810
"We wish you a happy Eid.
We wish everyone a happy Eid."

675
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:50.430
"We wish you a happy Eid.
It's time to celebrate."

676
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:54.150
"We wish you a happy Eid.
We wish everyone a happy Eid."

677
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57.800
"We wish you a happy Eid.
It's time to celebrate."

678
01:02:57,890 --> 01:03:01.700
"We wish you a happy Eid.
We wish everyone a happy Eid."

679
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08.070
It's not about selling drugs.

680
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11.640
There is nothing wrong or right
about one's work.

681
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:15.710
Maqsood...

682
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20.320
I don't trust him one bit.

683
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:25.510
Arun, this line of work cannot be trusted.

684
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43.020
I want a father for this child.

685
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:45.290
I want a home.

686
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:47.590
That's all I am asking for.

687
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:04.220
I will talk to Rama tomorrow.

688
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:07.960
I will tell him
I want to get out of this.

689
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21.320
Is Rama home?

690
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:23.330
He's out getting a haircut.

691
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27.340
- How are you?
- Mama...

692
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48.420
Arun was certain
he didn't want to do this anymore.

693
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:52.470
He was sick of this.

694
01:05:56,540 --> 01:06:00.200
And he knew where to find Rama
if he wasn't getting a haircut done.

695
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:32.640
Is Rama here? I want to talk to him.

696
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34.190
He isn't here.

697
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:37.810
Come in.

698
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:45.480
Pray that Arun doesn't
end up the same way.

699
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:51.400
He was going to quit.

700
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55.620
If you hadn't killed Rama that day...

701
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:57.980
...Arun wouldn't have become "Daddy".

702
01:08:26,610 --> 01:08:29.370
Arun tried hard to get out of all this...

703
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:33.890
...but there was a storm approaching.

704
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:36.569
First it was Babu.

705
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:38.700
Then Rama.

706
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:41.390
Who's next?

707
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:48.030
It's you, Arun.

708
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:16.800
Which is the other one?

709
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19.450
- It's there.
- Use them both.

710
01:09:21,689 --> 01:09:24.380
- Gawli's popularity is increasing.
- Yes.

711
01:09:25,479 --> 01:09:28.689
Elections are coming up,
but we don't have even one confession.

712
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:31.120
Witnesses are already terrified of Gawli.

713
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34.180
None of the shooters are willing to speak.

714
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:36.790
Everyone says he's going to win this time.

715
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:39.010
What about him?

716
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42.010
Hey...

717
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43.859
Leave me... I said, leave me!

718
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46.660
Hey! Don't touch me.
Why are you taking me there?

719
01:09:46,729 --> 01:09:48.399
- Come on... You'll see...
- What?

720
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50.620
-What are the charges against me?
-Come on!

721
01:09:50,689 --> 01:09:54.570
- Under what charges have you arrested me?
- Come... I'll tell you everything.

722
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:58.190
The problem of
sexual harassment hasn't been solved.

723
01:09:58,290 --> 01:09:59.690
So that isn't solved yet!

724
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:02.330
- Didn't we tell Joshi to handle this?
- Yes, Daddy.

725
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:04.820
- Tell him to fix this.
 - Okay.

726
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:08.960
Brother, Vijaykar has arrested Pamphlet.

727
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:18.320
Listen... Get our lawyer there.

728
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:25.650
Sir, that's Pamphlet Bandya.

729
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:27.780
I arrested him at the brothel.

730
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31.980
We found all these things in his bag.

731
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:45.660
What is this?

732
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:47.580
That's my hobby.

733
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50.400
It's just like gambling.

734
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59.520
Is collecting this your hobby too?

735
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:01.870
I have the same hobby.

736
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04.610
Bra... B.R.A.

737
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:06.990
Babu Rama Arun.

738
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:09.910
Look...

739
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14.680
if there's anything you
know about these three, tell us now.

740
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16.890
What's written in it?
What are these codes?

741
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18.480
We should know, shouldn't we?

742
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:19.750
Do you remember now?

743
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:28.340
- If you recall anything, then tell me.
- Speak!

744
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:33.170
Speak!

745
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:40.340
No, sir.

746
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:42.870
Arun would kill me.

747
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:47.280
Gawli is not what he seems.

748
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:21.280
Arun?

749
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:29.410
It's been a long time...
I suddenly thought of you.

750
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:31.100
Yes.

751
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35.520
- Would you like anything?
- Water, please.

752
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:36.610
Right away.

753
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59.570
Now you drink during the day, too.

754
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:05.740
What can I do?

755
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:10.910
There's not a single day...

756
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:14.320
...when I don't miss Rama.

757
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27.360
You remind me of him.

758
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:34.590
Don't you miss me?

759
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44.060
I know it.

760
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:50.150
I have seen the way you look at me.

761
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:10.330
You are lonely... Hm?

762
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:13.660
I remind you of Rama!

763
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:17.480
Why did you do it?

764
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:24.340
You tipped the police about Rama.

765
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:41.700
 Gawli knew that Hilda
tipped the police about Rama. 

766
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:46.860
 He could have killed her, but he didn't. 

767
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:50.460
This incident gained him respect
among everyone.

768
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:00.460
Hello.

769
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:01.980
Okay.

770
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:03.360
Brother, it's for you.

771
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13.000
Yeah...

772
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:14.830
Arun.

773
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:19.650
What makes you call me today?

774
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23.310
Avenge yourself on the policeman.

775
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:26.180
And if you stay quiet now,

776
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:29.600
people will forget about
your gang's existence.

777
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:32.760
I have an idea.

778
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:35.690
Call that cop to Dagdi.

779
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:40.160
Pump bullets into his chest
and have his body dragged out.

780
01:15:42,690 --> 01:15:44.230
Rama was your friend after all.

781
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:49.440
Rama still dwells in my heart.

782
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:54.950
But everyone knows
that he was hanging out with you lately.

783
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:57.450
I have an idea.

784
01:15:58,010 --> 01:16:00.800
Why don't you call that
cop to your area and do the same?

785
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04.390
I'm more interested in
the guy who sent the cop to kill Rama.

786
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:19.400
This was a direct challenge.

787
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21.340
And, he decided...

788
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:24.690
...to go back to Dagdi.

789
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:53.190
He knew that if he had to fight a war...

790
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55.750
...he would need a fort.

791
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:58.210
- Pass it over.
- One Mouser.

792
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:01.420
One Mouser, one Magnum...

793
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03.180
...two double barrels.

794
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:08.080
And that's just what he did.

795
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09.160
I need this done...

796
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:11.150
- Pamphlet, have you seen Arun?
- No.

797
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:12.440
He must be at home.

798
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:14.630
- I...
- What's going on?

799
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:15.870
We're renovating.

800
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:18.120
Fix that quickly.

801
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:44.790
Arun doesn't trust anyone.

802
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:49.390
If he knows I'm here,
he won't spare me.

803
01:17:56,210 --> 01:18:00.560
If he kills you,
we won't spare you either.

804
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07.200
Sir, we found all this at his place.

805
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13.520
I used to be his bookkeeper.

806
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:17.150
No. 21. Take it.

807
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:20.550
22... Get going.

808
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24.540
This is boring, Brother.
When do I get to be part of the action?

809
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:27.560
You keep the accounts.

810
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:33.970
You, come here.

811
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:42.020
- What's your name?
- Prashant.

812
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:44.890
- Where are you from?
- Dharavi.

813
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51.180
- Where are you from?
- Dharavi.

814
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54.620
- Dagdi... Dagdi...
- What did I tell you?

815
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:57.840
It was a mistake... I made a mistake.

816
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05.800
Go... Go from here.

817
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:08.720
Which area are you from?

818
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:12.020
Where are you from?

819
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:30.320
 Sada, what are
people saying about me? 

820
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:35.420
Brother, since we don't
get out of Dagdi...

821
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:38.040
...people wonder if our gang is scared.

822
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:45.330
We need to paralyze Maqsood.

823
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:49.000
Only then will they
take our gang seriously.

824
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:50.950
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

825
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:56.790
- Are the boys ready?
- Yes.

826
01:20:01,770 --> 01:20:02.770
Pamphlet?

827
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:04.670
They are ready.

828
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07.710
That's his family album.

829
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:11.630
Open it.

830
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:16.390
This is Manish Duggal, his film financer.

831
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:18.770
Kill him.

832
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:32.490
You've been blessed with a girl.

833
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:38.520
That's good.

834
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41.720
Boys cause a lot of trouble.

835
01:21:42,190 --> 01:21:44.840
Lord Shiva has been kind. Hm?

836
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:46.670
Yes, He has.

837
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:48.820
Her nose is not like yours.

838
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:54.070
Can I?
Come to me, baby.

839
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01.440
Look at her, Sada. Eh?

840
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:03.550
Look at those eyes...

841
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:07.690
They've got power in them. She's got guts.

842
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:10.520
Don't you? Don't you?

843
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:14.400
Come on, play your card.

844
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:17.680
- Hey, give the gun to him.
- Who is it?

845
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22.190
Hey! Drop the gun!

846
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:25.490
Hey!

847
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29.090
Move! Move!

848
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:45.570
You've been cleaned up real good.

849
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50.080
Go on.

850
01:22:58,390 --> 01:22:59.930
Do you know why I slapped you?

851
01:23:02,690 --> 01:23:04.710
Because there's no point in killing you.

852
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08.040
Either the police will kill you
or Maqsood will.

853
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:11.660
Now go and tell him...

854
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:15.160
...that we're coming for him.

855
01:23:39,630 --> 01:23:41.630
Greetings, Don. Sautya's here.

856
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:43.480
Remember, I told you about him.

857
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45.740
Yes, I've heard that name.

858
01:23:48,650 --> 01:23:49.950
He's a real loose cannon.

859
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:54.120
He'll do anything for you,
and he's even ready to go to jail.

860
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:55.820
Hey! Sit on the chair.

861
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59.140
I'm talking to you.
Sit on the chair.

862
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:03.240
No, sir. I'm good down here.

863
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:08.300
What's the job?

864
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:35.630
This is for you.

865
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:36.900
- Who is he?
- Get going.

866
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:40.510
Boss, I guess this is for you.
"Congratulations Arun."

867
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:42.770
- What is it?
- Sweets.

868
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:44.280
Open it.

869
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:46.430
Isn't he your friend?

870
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:49.530
Yes, he is. But he's a real man.

871
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:55.380
That's Ashok Joshi's ring.

872
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:57.250
What are you saying?

873
01:24:57,810 --> 01:24:59.070
What is that?

874
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:03.550
Get out! Out! Get out of my house now!

875
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05.490
Arun, tell them to get out!

876
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:08.300
Get out! Are you deaf?

877
01:25:08,890 --> 01:25:11.310
What's all this?
Who gave this to you?

878
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14.280
They came to Dagdi for this?
Who's in charge of security?

879
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:15.670
What kind of father are you?

880
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17.350
What about your daughter Geeta?

881
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:19.240
Will we live in fear our entire life?

882
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:21.360
Look after the child. You're scaring her.

883
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:25.130
Although Arun had taken over after Rama...

884
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29.530
...he was a family man.

885
01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:33.760
How was he to manage
the gang's affairs?

886
01:25:35,570 --> 01:25:37.570
All of us were shitting bricks...

887
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:41.160
...because he had locked horns
with Maqsood.

888
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:48.880
Brother, Chinese marvel.

889
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:58.650
Don't be fooled by the size.
It's fully automatic, and...

890
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:04.150
- Brother, why don't you rest up?
- Come to me, baby.

891
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:06.130
Don't cry, baby.

892
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:07.560
We'll deal with him.

893
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:12.240
And it's not right for you to go there.

894
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:14.550
You shouldn't expose yourself.

895
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:16.970
We're here... We'll handle it.

896
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:57.670
- Do you have a shot, Sada?
- No.

897
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:00.370
Shoot him when you do.

898
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:12.490
- How are you?
- All good.

899
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:37.920
Go inside. I'll handle them.

900
01:27:41,110 --> 01:27:42.110
Go inside, boss!

901
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:45.110
Boss, you go inside!

902
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48.000
It's not the right time!

903
01:27:48,110 --> 01:27:50.240
With that daring attempt
to kill Maqsood...

904
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:53.230
...the entire underworld
took notice of Arun.

905
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:55.570
Sir, a man wants to see you.
He says it's urgent.

906
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:57.520
- Where is he?
- He's sitting outside.

907
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:07.000
What's going on here?
Get out...now!

908
01:28:10,170 --> 01:28:11.170
What does he want?

909
01:28:12,530 --> 01:28:14.410
Nothing, I just want to talk.

910
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:18.950
I heard you're carrying out
a full investigation.

911
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:22.400
- I know Daddy better than anyone else.
- What do you mean?

912
01:28:23,710 --> 01:28:28.080
I mean you can ask me anything
you want to know about Daddy.

913
01:28:28,730 --> 01:28:29.730
I will tell you.

914
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:34.020
- I'm writing a book on Daddy.
- Okay.

915
01:28:34,430 --> 01:28:37.700
I want to know what Daddy did
after attacking Maqsood.

916
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:39.450
I want to know that.

917
01:28:41,130 --> 01:28:43.810
That's what people say.

918
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:47.640
But do you know what the truth is?

919
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:52.990
At that time, Daddy was with
all of us at Ratnagiri...

920
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:57.580
...for a picnic.

921
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:29.680
"Some call You Benevolent
and some call You Compassionate."

922
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:40.060
"Some call You Benevolent
and some call You Compassionate."

923
01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:43.520
"Some call You the Generous Lord."

924
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:46.950
"Anyone who bows before You..."

925
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:50.660
"...fears no one, O Lord."

926
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:54.320
"Beat those drums really loud..."

927
01:29:54,410 --> 01:29:57.550
"...for here comes Lord Ganesha."

928
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:01.280
"Bring that vermillion
to adorn my Lord."

929
01:30:01,370 --> 01:30:04.560
"Everybody sing with me.
Hail, Lord Ganesha."

930
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:08.400
- Son of Lord Shambhu!
- Lord Ganesha!

931
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:11.740
- Who's the destroyer of troubles?
- Lord Ganesha!

932
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:15.120
- Who rules everyone's heart?
- Lord Ganesha!

933
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:19.460
- Son of Lord Shambhu!
- Lord Ganesha!

934
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:28.880
"There's great pomp and show everywhere."

935
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:32.330
"Everyone's dancing and swaying with joy."

936
01:30:32,410 --> 01:30:35.940
"No one's standing idle, everyone's high."

937
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:38.930
"Such is the effect of Lord Ganesha."

938
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42.630
"I can't live a year without You."

939
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:46.240
"In fact, we urge You to stay this year."

940
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:49.950
"Beat those drums really loud..."

941
01:30:50,030 --> 01:30:53.470
"...for here comes Lord Ganesha."

942
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:03.680
"O Lord Ganesha, Benevolent One..."

943
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:06.950
"O Lord Ganesha... Glory to Lord Ganesha."

944
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:10.240
"You're our benefactor, our protector,
you're Almighty, O Lord Ganesha."

945
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:14.080
"The destroyer of evil...
Glory to Lord Ganesha."

946
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:55.710
Go home.

947
01:31:57,810 --> 01:31:58.810
Arun.

948
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:01.310
Arun!

949
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:43.220
Hail, Lord Shambhu Narayan!

950
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:45.570
Hail, Lord Shambhu Narayan!

951
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:39.380
Maqsood killed Gawli's brother.

952
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:43.490
He broke the rules of the game.

953
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:47.710
He didn't consider the festival
or family.

954
01:33:56,670 --> 01:34:00.330
But you knew which side
your bread was buttered on, right?

955
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:05.270
Everyone knows who tipped him off.

956
01:34:06,910 --> 01:34:07.910
You did.

957
01:34:09,070 --> 01:34:11.020
Is that because Maqsood is a cop's son?

958
01:34:12,390 --> 01:34:14.090
Does that make him your family member?

959
01:34:14,530 --> 01:34:17.050
Since we're digging up the past,
here's something else.

960
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:22.050
We have details about the
flight he caught to get out of India.

961
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:26.770
We also have the details of
who made his passport.

962
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:31.970
You remember everything, don't you?

963
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:34.490
Am I right?

964
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:40.700
It will take a couple of months.

965
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:44.390
Maybe we'll have a solution 
in the next 6-7 months.

966
01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:46.840
What are you trying to say?

967
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:50.430
Do you mean the don will have to stay
out of the country for seven months?

968
01:34:50,910 --> 01:34:52.700
You're deciding where we will stay!

969
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:56.270
Mumbai doesn't belong to anyone except us!
Hm? What do you mean?

970
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:04.330
Are you giving me a tip
or is this free advice?

971
01:35:04,590 --> 01:35:07.830
Not advice, sir.
The government's policies are changing.

972
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12.000
Such cases are going
to be charged under the TADA...

973
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:14.230
...and it doesn't qualify for bail.

974
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17.280
And then even I will be helpless.

975
01:35:17,370 --> 01:35:20.550
I see... Now you're thinking 
about government's policies.

976
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:23.630
Didn't this occur to you
when we filled your pockets?

977
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:27.430
"TADA will be implemented.
There will be this and that..."

978
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:28.610
That's bullshit!

979
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:41.340
You helped Maqsood escape...

980
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:45.330
...and you used TADA
as an excuse to enter Dagdi.

981
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:48.860
- Gaitonde, check the meter room.
- Check upstairs!

982
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:53.520
Hey! Don't move!

983
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:51.830
"...awaken our spiritual consciousness."

984
01:36:52,910 --> 01:36:53.930
Arun...

985
01:36:54,030 --> 01:36:55.930
"Om..."

986
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:57.990
Wait a minute, Inspector.

987
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:04.240
Praise Lord Shiva!

988
01:37:05,690 --> 01:37:08.320
You took the credit for nabbing Arun...

989
01:37:10,410 --> 01:37:13.060
...but the truth is
that Arun wanted to get arrested.

990
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:18.900
And that's because he knew
he was safest inside.

991
01:37:19,470 --> 01:37:20.470
What is it?

992
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:22.990
It's for Gawli.

993
01:37:45,870 --> 01:37:46.870
Brother...

994
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:49.260
Brother...

995
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:51.120
Brother...

996
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:53.760
Lunch for you.

997
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46.120
Keep it here.

998
01:38:50,860 --> 01:38:52.500
I don't want any complaints.

999
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:34.340
How are you?

1000
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:41.050
Geeta.

1001
01:39:53,150 --> 01:39:54.150
She's grown up.

1002
01:39:59,860 --> 01:40:01.140
When are you coming home?

1003
01:40:03,820 --> 01:40:05.120
That will take some time.

1004
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:11.410
What are you hiding from me, Arun?

1005
01:40:12,310 --> 01:40:14.050
Maqsood has sent his men in here.

1006
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:16.870
They want to kill me.

1007
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:18.920
Let's go... Time's up

1008
01:40:21,820 --> 01:40:23.370
Get me out of here.

1009
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00.385
It wasn't just a bad time in the city...

1010
01:41:01,886 --> 01:41:03.240
...but in the jail as well.

1011
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:06.860
They separated Hindu prisoners
from Muslim prisoners...

1012
01:41:07,630 --> 01:41:09.190
...so that they wouldn't riot.

1013
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:15.330
But Arun knew that
he had to keep Dagdi safe.

1014
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:18.290
Remove this.

1015
01:41:24,030 --> 01:41:27.540
No rioting in Dagdi and Chinchpokli.

1016
01:41:28,810 --> 01:41:31.670
Our feud is not with any
religion or community!

1017
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:33.160
Stay united.

1018
01:41:34,190 --> 01:41:37.890
Dagdi will protect the
Muslims, understand?

1019
01:41:39,290 --> 01:41:40.290
Pull it down.

1020
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:43.850
Don't worry...

1021
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:46.550
Stress affects your hair.

1022
01:41:53,690 --> 01:41:56.080
Times had changed,
but Daddy was still the same.

1023
01:41:56,490 --> 01:41:58.370
He always thought of his people.

1024
01:42:41,330 --> 01:42:42.420
Shake hands with me.

1025
01:42:43,590 --> 01:42:44.660
Hey...

1026
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:46.900
Shake hands with me!

1027
01:42:49,470 --> 01:42:52.010
Brother...it's done.

1028
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:54.950
These are the papers
to bail you out. Just sign here.

1029
01:43:01,170 --> 01:43:02.200
I won't sign this.

1030
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:03.960
Why?

1031
01:43:04,980 --> 01:43:06.460
I don't want to come out now.

1032
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10.330
It's a trap.
They're waiting for me outside.

1033
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:12.830
This is what they want.

1034
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:16.810
If I come out, they'll kill me.

1035
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:21.310
They can kill you in here as well.

1036
01:43:26,210 --> 01:43:27.730
Get me transferred from here.

1037
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:34.820
Get me out of this place.
Make some arrangements for that.

1038
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57.890
 For 10 years, Arun moved
from one jail to another. 

1039
01:43:59,710 --> 01:44:02.470
 She would get the transfer done. 

1040
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:05.800
She would follow his car each time...

1041
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:08.380
...to make sure there were
no traps on the way.

1042
01:44:16,090 --> 01:44:17.090
Greetings.

1043
01:44:17,980 --> 01:44:18.980
Open up.

1044
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:21.170
Come.

1045
01:44:21,950 --> 01:44:23.510
- Everything okay?
- Yes, sir.

1046
01:44:24,590 --> 01:44:26.110
Two people are here to see you.

1047
01:44:27,070 --> 01:44:28.680
- Uncle...
- Sachin.

1048
01:44:29,470 --> 01:44:30.680
- How are you?
- Great.

1049
01:44:30,750 --> 01:44:33.490
- Have some vadapav.
- See what the Chief Minister said!

1050
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:34.560
What is this?

1051
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:40.390
It says,
"Our answer to Maqsood is Gawli".

1052
01:44:43,740 --> 01:44:45.000
I've got vadapav for you.

1053
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:48.930
It's in the Marathi newspaper, too.

1054
01:44:49,030 --> 01:44:52.390
"With our children, Arun Gawli
and the backing of the minister..."

1055
01:44:52,470 --> 01:44:54.240
The entire country has gone to dogs.

1056
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:56.380
Now only you can run the country.

1057
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59.560
- Isn't it true, boys?
- Yes, you're right.

1058
01:44:59,650 --> 01:45:01.180
- Yes, he can...
- He can!

1059
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:03.780
Brother, why don't
you run for Prime Minister?

1060
01:45:29,110 --> 01:45:30.110
Brother Arun!

1061
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34.360
Brother Arun! Greetings to you!

1062
01:45:37,470 --> 01:45:39.350
Brother Arun!

1063
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48.400
10 years is a long time

1064
01:45:51,210 --> 01:45:53.230
to spend within four walls.

1065
01:45:56,030 --> 01:45:59.570
I went to jail because, unlike others,
I am not a traitor.

1066
01:46:01,010 --> 01:46:03.190
I won't flee from my own country.

1067
01:46:07,150 --> 01:46:08.430
I was afraid...

1068
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:11.970
...that my people wouldn't
recognize me when I come out.

1069
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:18.470
But your love has made that fear flee,
just like my enemies.

1070
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:23.490
I'll always be indebted to you...
to all of you...

1071
01:46:24,070 --> 01:46:26.620
for the love and respect
you gave me and my family.

1072
01:46:30,350 --> 01:46:32.990
From now on,
it will be my responsibility...

1073
01:46:35,190 --> 01:46:36.930
...to take care of your problems.

1074
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:39.040
Hey...

1075
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43.880
You're such a grown up girl, Geeta,
aren't you?

1076
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:46.280
- What's this?
- It's for you.

1077
01:46:48,930 --> 01:46:51.180
It's in English, so you read it for me.

1078
01:46:51,820 --> 01:46:53.340
"Welcome home, Daddy."

1079
01:46:53,690 --> 01:46:54.980
I see...

1080
01:46:57,340 --> 01:46:58.500
Daddy!

1081
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:01.680
Daddy! Daddy!

1082
01:47:02,170 --> 01:47:03.830
Daddy! Daddy!

1083
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:06.510
Daddy! Daddy!

1084
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:08.580
Daddy! Daddy!

1085
01:47:08,970 --> 01:47:11.610
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

1086
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:13.380
Daddy! Daddy!

1087
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:15.730
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

1088
01:47:15,821 --> 01:47:16.980
Daddy! Daddy!

1089
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:19.020
And that's exactly how he got his name.

1090
01:47:19,660 --> 01:47:20.660
'Daddy.'

1091
01:47:21,710 --> 01:47:24.450
Now that you know everything...

1092
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:27.350
...just tell me one thing.

1093
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:30.660
Where is Pamphlet?

1094
01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:34.140
We're here for him.

1095
01:47:34,550 --> 01:47:37.260
You see, we want to apply for his bail.

1096
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39.710
- Yes, we even have the documents.
- Yes, we do.

1097
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:40.800
He isn't here.

1098
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:43.870
Do you have a weak memory?

1099
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:51.100
Actually, old age is a cruel disease.

1100
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:53.370
By the time you're close to retiring...

1101
01:47:53,890 --> 01:47:57.390
...you can't shoot straight,
your hands start trembling...

1102
01:47:57,710 --> 01:48:00.930
...and you end up appointing a nurse.

1103
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:02.220
Damn you...

1104
01:48:03,190 --> 01:48:08.060
I will show you where you belong
once you get out of your house!

1105
01:48:08,150 --> 01:48:10.030
I will show you where you belong!

1106
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:12.410
You're just an ordinary gangster.

1107
01:48:12,490 --> 01:48:14.920
I've dealt with cops like you before.

1108
01:48:18,830 --> 01:48:20.550
I had to lie for you.

1109
01:48:21,060 --> 01:48:23.310
I'll deal with him once he comes out.

1110
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:25.490
Your friends are here to bail you out.

1111
01:48:26,940 --> 01:48:28.120
No, I won't go out.

1112
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30.840
Then sit there. Come!

1113
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:32.320
Let him go!

1114
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:41.290
It seems everything was
going well for Daddy.

1115
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:44.710
...so what's his connection
with this guy?

1116
01:48:55,210 --> 01:48:57.010
My boss really respects you.

1117
01:48:57,980 --> 01:49:00.980
He said that I must get you
into our party at any cost.

1118
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:04.760
Sachin told me...

1119
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:08.310
...that you want police protection.
Right?

1120
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:12.020
That will be taken care of.
Just run from our party.

1121
01:49:13,150 --> 01:49:14.150
But Daddy...

1122
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:18.780
...this time you'll run from Chembur
and not Chinchpokli.

1123
01:49:19,780 --> 01:49:21.220
I hope you're okay with that.

1124
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:30.280
Who are you?

1125
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:33.610
Daddy, he's in the
Legislative Assembly, Mr. Mhatre.

1126
01:49:35,710 --> 01:49:38.420
I came to meet your boss.
Call him. We'll talk.

1127
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:40.190
My boss isn't well.

1128
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:43.150
He can't meet you today, understand?

1129
01:49:47,740 --> 01:49:50.350
We came all the way from Dagdi
to meet with you people.

1130
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:53.040
When your boss feels better...

1131
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:55.920
...tell him to come to Dagdi.
We'll talk there.

1132
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58.170
- This isn't done.
- Daddy...

1133
01:49:58,250 --> 01:50:00.090
That's how it works.

1134
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:03.930
My boss will talk to you
when he feels better. He'll meet you.

1135
01:50:04,010 --> 01:50:06.360
Sachin, come here.
I want to show you something.

1136
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:10.190
Sada, isn't that where
Khatau Mill was?

1137
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:12.120
Remember how he came crying to us...

1138
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:14.490
...asking us to have the place vacated?

1139
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:17.310
Who gave the orders?

1140
01:50:18,910 --> 01:50:19.910
Your boss.

1141
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:23.720
I see that now he has a big house there,
doesn't he?

1142
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:26.360
- Daddy, please...
- I get it.

1143
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:30.950
- These people still think I'm a gangster.
- No...

1144
01:50:31,150 --> 01:50:35.600
Yes, that's why they can make me a
candidate but they can't be seen with me.

1145
01:50:35,670 --> 01:50:37.190
Daddy, please...

1146
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:39.590
You're mistaken.
At least listen to him once.

1147
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:41.550
It will make our lives better.

1148
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:45.360
Please, I worked really hard for this.

1149
01:50:47,550 --> 01:50:49.810
I too worked hard for them,
but what did I get?

1150
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:52.940
They are not like us.

1151
01:50:53,690 --> 01:50:54.690
Daddy?

1152
01:50:55,090 --> 01:50:56.140
Praise Lord Shiva.

1153
01:51:00,270 --> 01:51:01.570
It's only a few more days.

1154
01:51:05,170 --> 01:51:07.360
Arun's going to win this election, sir.

1155
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:12.200
I'll be dead for sure.

1156
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:15.790
Start praying.

1157
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:18.280
Pray to God that he doesn't win.

1158
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:24.760
Here...

1159
01:51:26,630 --> 01:51:27.630
Yes, Sada.

1160
01:51:28,860 --> 01:51:32.660
There's a problem.

1161
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:36.990
Pamphlet has turned hostile.

1162
01:51:38,330 --> 01:51:41.350
- Before the election...
- Listen, you won't do anything.

1163
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:42.790
We are white-collars now.

1164
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:46.570
Focus on winning the election.

1165
01:51:47,270 --> 01:51:50.220
Once we win, everything will
fall into place. Understood?

1166
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:59.900
You said all the cases and charges
against me were dismissed.

1167
01:52:01,150 --> 01:52:02.150
What is this now?

1168
01:52:03,830 --> 01:52:07.000
Daddy, all the old cases are settled.
I swear.

1169
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:10.070
If they've filed a new case,
I know nothing about it.

1170
01:52:32,980 --> 01:52:35.360
Come fast! Quickly!

1171
01:52:43,190 --> 01:52:46.240
- Move back!
-Hey... You coward!

1172
01:52:46,630 --> 01:52:49.240
Stop hiding behind women!

1173
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:53.200
I guess I'll have to send a
lady constable to bring you out.

1174
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:57.160
Move back!

1175
01:52:59,690 --> 01:53:01.520
What is it? What are you doing here?

1176
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:04.800
I've come to take you back to jail.

1177
01:53:08,830 --> 01:53:09.890
Do you have a warrant?

1178
01:53:11,610 --> 01:53:14.280
I have pages of evidence
and confessions against you.

1179
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:17.740
Right... Go make paper planes out of them.

1180
01:53:18,290 --> 01:53:21.010
Take your pansies and get out of here.

1181
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:23.890
Who the hell did you call a pansy?

1182
01:53:24,550 --> 01:53:27.650
Don't ever enter Dagdi without a warrant.

1183
01:53:28,290 --> 01:53:30.120
By the way, I heard you are retiring.

1184
01:53:30,180 --> 01:53:32.720
Perhaps I could give you
a job as my bodyguard.

1185
01:53:32,830 --> 01:53:34.220
- Hey...!
- Beat it!

1186
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:39.930
You want to kill me!
Look at him, he's here to kill me.

1187
01:53:40,590 --> 01:53:43.770
That's our police for you...
Encounter specialist.

1188
01:53:43,870 --> 01:53:46.350
"Come on, shoot me. Encounter specialist."

1189
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:49.560
Did he discuss this
with any of his seniors? Hm?

1190
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:52.950
"Encounter specialist. Come on, shoot me."

1191
01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:55.150
- "Beat it!"
- "Come on, shoot me!"

1192
01:53:56,930 --> 01:53:58.860
Sir, I didn't inform anyone...

1193
01:54:00,770 --> 01:54:02.660
...or receive anyone's permission.

1194
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:06.040
He outplayed you again.

1195
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:12.620
Just watch how Gawli gets
sympathy out of this.

1196
01:54:12,690 --> 01:54:14.610
I messed up, sir.
I should've shot him.

1197
01:54:14,670 --> 01:54:17.770
Don't talk shit, Vijaykar.
Don't act smart!

1198
01:54:18,210 --> 01:54:19.990
Do you want him to win the election?

1199
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:24.350
There you go.
The Home Secretary is calling.

1200
01:54:24,650 --> 01:54:25.650
Talk to him.

1201
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:29.260
Yes, sir.

1202
01:54:39,930 --> 01:54:42.580
The number of the bullet
and the name of the shooter...

1203
01:54:42,660 --> 01:54:47.520
You see, sir, Pamphlet has
used a different code each time.

1204
01:54:49,420 --> 01:54:51.610
And he keeps forgetting
what the codes mean.

1205
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:56.750
I am not sure that this is
admissible in court.

1206
01:54:58,780 --> 01:55:01.280
I think we need to find another way.

1207
01:55:04,130 --> 01:55:06.510
If we follow the procedures,
we'll get nowhere.

1208
01:55:07,350 --> 01:55:10.020
Then what will we do, sir?

1209
01:55:15,210 --> 01:55:18.400
Pappu Borivali,
you recognize us, don't you?

1210
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:24.370
You killed your girlfriend.
That's really bad.

1211
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:28.020
You're definitely going to
rot behind bars for 15-20 years.

1212
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:31.500
Do you see my senior there?

1213
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:36.540
He can get you out in two years.

1214
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:42.450
But no one's going to do it for free.

1215
01:55:44,710 --> 01:55:47.730
This is a map. Can you memorize it?

1216
01:55:53,210 --> 01:55:55.850
Hail Arun Gawli!

1217
01:55:55,940 --> 01:55:58.150
Hail Arun Gawli!

1218
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:02.580
Good luck, Daddy.

1219
01:56:06,010 --> 01:56:07.010
Come.

1220
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:11.710
Hail Arun Gawli!

1221
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:13.490
Hail Arun Gawli!

1222
01:57:20,260 --> 01:57:22.520
Sada, you know what you
have to do, don't you?

1223
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:23.840
Yes.

1224
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:41.320
They've set up roadblocks ahead.

1225
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:42.770
No one will do anything.

1226
01:57:43,810 --> 01:57:45.870
"Wait for my instructions."

1227
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:02.110
"I can see them."

1228
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:04.700
Hold on...

1229
01:58:15,080 --> 01:58:17.020
Send both men from the left side.

1230
01:58:59,810 --> 01:59:00.810
Damn...

1231
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:03.030
"Polling Booth"

1232
01:59:04,310 --> 01:59:05.860
You better come back to me.

1233
01:59:05,940 --> 01:59:07.780
You go, Brother. I'll handle them.

1234
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:14.680
Let's go.

1235
01:59:38,660 --> 01:59:39.720
Hello.

1236
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:42.450
Idiot of a constable,
you're not answering my calls.

1237
01:59:43,330 --> 01:59:45.370
Do you know what this victory means?

1238
01:59:49,380 --> 01:59:52.450
"Hail, Arun Gawli!"

1239
01:59:53,190 --> 01:59:56.140
"Arun Gawli makes history
by winning the election."

1240
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:59.520
"The entire area is
celebrating his victory!"

1241
01:59:59,610 --> 02:00:02.140
"And Arun is thanking the people."

1242
02:00:02,910 --> 02:00:04.430
"It feels like a miracle..."

1243
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:08.130
"...that Arun Gulab Gawli is
now a member of Parliament!"

1244
02:00:08,670 --> 02:00:11.670
- "Keep striving Arun Gawli."
- "We're with you all the way!"

1245
02:00:11,750 --> 02:00:13.790
Our dreams have finally come true, Arun.

1246
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:16.540
We won.

1247
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:20.080
What kind of victory is this?

1248
02:00:21,670 --> 02:00:23.050
Everyone's left us.

1249
02:00:23,130 --> 02:00:25.640
No... Don't say that.

1250
02:00:25,830 --> 02:00:27.700
"He has a long way to go..."

1251
02:00:27,790 --> 02:00:29.280
The people are with you, Arun.

1252
02:00:29,350 --> 02:00:31.350
"He won with the most number of votes..."

1253
02:00:31,420 --> 02:00:35.530
"...and it feels like it's just
the beginning of his political career."

1254
02:00:39,970 --> 02:00:46.270
On behalf of Mumbai Police...
we ask...

1255
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:48.740
...that Arun Gulab Gawli, aka Daddy...

1256
02:00:48,980 --> 02:00:50.930
...not be given police protection.

1257
02:00:55,130 --> 02:00:57.980
In order to eradicate
the Mumbai Underworld...

1258
02:00:58,250 --> 02:01:01.740
...15 inspectors and 60 cops
have sacrificed their lives.

1259
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:07.170
The Mumbai Police has filed
120 cases against Arun Gawli.

1260
02:01:07,620 --> 02:01:11.970
Murder, attempt to murder,
extortions, conspiracy...

1261
02:01:12,280 --> 02:01:15.640
If Arun Gawli is given
police protection...

1262
02:01:16,090 --> 02:01:19.870
...then it will be an insult
to all the martyred officers.

1263
02:01:21,030 --> 02:01:22.860
That's correct!

1264
02:01:23,830 --> 02:01:27.320
Silence... Silence, please.

1265
02:01:35,810 --> 02:01:36.980
Honorable Speaker...

1266
02:01:38,610 --> 02:01:41.920
...in the past, a lot happened
between the police and me.

1267
02:01:43,830 --> 02:01:47.120
I paid a very big price for my past...

1268
02:01:48,070 --> 02:01:50.870
...by spending more than
half my life in jail.

1269
02:01:51,850 --> 02:01:55.620
If the people can forgive me, then
why is it so difficult for all of you?

1270
02:01:55,700 --> 02:01:57.270
The people have not forgotten.

1271
02:01:57,370 --> 02:01:59.930
You still have the image of a gangster.

1272
02:02:00,210 --> 02:02:02.410
The image can be changed
if you let me work.

1273
02:02:02,770 --> 02:02:04.820
And for that, I have to
go among the people.

1274
02:02:04,910 --> 02:02:07.390
Because of my past, I have enemies.

1275
02:02:07,860 --> 02:02:12.330
If the police won't protect me...I'll have
to arrange for security and carry weapons.

1276
02:02:12,510 --> 02:02:15.710
And then people will call me
a gangster once again.

1277
02:02:15,790 --> 02:02:19.400
Hey, Gawli!
You said you'll carry weapons!

1278
02:02:19,940 --> 02:02:22.470
And you want us to
believe you have changed!

1279
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:25.335
If I haven't, it's because
you won't let me. That cop...

1280
02:02:25,966 --> 02:02:28.000
...arrests my men without any charges.

1281
02:02:28,090 --> 02:02:31.040
He waits outside my home
to kill me in an encounter.

1282
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:35.660
I have changed
but none of you accept that.

1283
02:02:35,730 --> 02:02:39.300
Ladies and gentlemen, we won't
tolerate the humiliation of democracy.

1284
02:02:39,390 --> 02:02:40.750
This joke on democracy...

1285
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:43.180
...won't be tolerated!
It won't be tolerated!

1286
02:02:44,710 --> 02:02:46.540
Your Honor,
Arun's motive was clear.

1287
02:02:47,580 --> 02:02:49.720
The reason behind killing MLA Mhatre...

1288
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:52.320
...was Arun Gawli's public humiliation.

1289
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:54.760
They were enemies.

1290
02:02:56,030 --> 02:02:58.860
We have both records and
witnesses to support it.

1291
02:03:01,060 --> 02:03:03.400
And through our investigation,
we learned...

1292
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:07.040
...that the orders to kill Mhatre
came directly from Arun.

1293
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:11.890
In defense against these charges...

1294
02:03:12,130 --> 02:03:13.950
...do you have anything to say?

1295
02:03:16,240 --> 02:03:17.240
I am innocent.

1296
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:21.480
Do you know this woman?

1297
02:03:26,340 --> 02:03:27.530
My friend knew her.

1298
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:32.810
Confess everything, Arun.
You will feel unburdened.

1299
02:03:34,460 --> 02:03:37.330
You're getting another
opportunity, just like me.

1300
02:03:37,770 --> 02:03:39.550
I strongly object, Your Honor.

1301
02:03:39,870 --> 02:03:43.310
We have enough evidence
to prove Rani's character.

1302
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:48.680
The Police had already
set their sights on Arun.

1303
02:03:48,990 --> 02:03:51.460
But it seems they are trying to prove...

1304
02:03:51,550 --> 02:03:54.890
...that this hooker's network
is stronger than that of the police.

1305
02:03:55,780 --> 02:03:56.780
Point taken.

1306
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:07.110
Your Honor, this man here
kept all the records...

1307
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:09.700
...Gawli's guns, pistols
and other ammunition.

1308
02:04:10,860 --> 02:04:14.000
Do you know him, or is it
your friend who knew him?

1309
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:18.920
I know him.

1310
02:04:19,850 --> 02:04:21.470
This is a country-made pistol...

1311
02:04:21,580 --> 02:04:23.400
...that was used to kill MLA Mhatre.

1312
02:04:24,660 --> 02:04:26.190
Does this gun belong to Gawli?

1313
02:04:27,700 --> 02:04:29.990
Yes. This is Gawli's gun.

1314
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:33.070
Is this your gun?

1315
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:34.880
I am a gangster, Your Honor.

1316
02:04:35,610 --> 02:04:36.890
I use automatic weapons.

1317
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:39.755
Why would I use a country-made pistol?

1318
02:04:40,216 --> 02:04:44.470
For 40 years, Gawli has been accused of
many crimes but acquitted at every trial.

1319
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46.790
This is the biggest case
of the millennium.

1320
02:04:51,740 --> 02:04:53.240
They changed the judge again.

1321
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:02.550
According to our sources,
Gawli gave 3000000 rupees...

1322
02:05:03,410 --> 02:05:04.740
...to kill Mhatre.

1323
02:05:06,090 --> 02:05:09.330
Yes, I gave him the contract.

1324
02:05:11,080 --> 02:05:13.020
I don't know this man.

1325
02:05:19,690 --> 02:05:21.990
Do you know why you've
been called to the court?

1326
02:05:22,070 --> 02:05:23.070
Yes.

1327
02:05:25,610 --> 02:05:27.100
Did he fire at Mhatre?

1328
02:05:32,950 --> 02:05:34.740
- Yes, sir.
- Are you sure?

1329
02:05:36,020 --> 02:05:37.180
Yes, it was him.

1330
02:05:39,010 --> 02:05:42.180
- Have you met Arun Gawli?
- Yes, I have.

1331
02:05:42,490 --> 02:05:44.170
I strongly object, Your Honor.

1332
02:05:45,170 --> 02:05:46.300
Objection overruled.

1333
02:05:47,420 --> 02:05:48.640
Have you worked for him?

1334
02:05:49,530 --> 02:05:50.800
Yes, I have.

1335
02:05:51,050 --> 02:05:52.050
Tell me where he is.

1336
02:05:55,420 --> 02:05:56.800
That's him, sitting there.

1337
02:06:12,210 --> 02:06:14.420
Do you have anything
to say in your defense?

1338
02:06:15,190 --> 02:06:17.800
Five judges changed
and we already have a judgment.

1339
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:20.980
I've never seen any
case wrapped up so quickly.

1340
02:06:22,370 --> 02:06:25.590
The police and I never got along,
so they brought fake witnesses.

1341
02:06:25,820 --> 02:06:28.310
They claim I accepted the
contract to kill Mhatre.

1342
02:06:29,050 --> 02:06:30.760
Why would I kill Mhatre?

1343
02:06:31,510 --> 02:06:34.460
I gave my two seats to his party so
they could form a majority.

1344
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:39.230
I served punishment for the
mistakes that I have made.

1345
02:06:40,860 --> 02:06:42.680
But now I want to do something good.

1346
02:06:43,830 --> 02:06:45.920
I have faith in your system
and that you...

1347
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:50.040
...will make the right decision.

1348
02:06:50,350 --> 02:06:51.580
 Yes, I will... 

1349
02:06:54,820 --> 02:06:56.640
Arun Gawli, I should give you death.

1350
02:06:58,690 --> 02:07:00.510
But I give you life.

1351
02:07:16,490 --> 02:07:17.830
Let's go...

1352
02:07:21,330 --> 02:07:24.290
- Sir, one photo...
- Please!

1353
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43.840
Move back... Move back...

1354
02:08:01,870 --> 02:08:04.770
Daddy, I've been following
your story from the beginning.

1355
02:08:05,030 --> 02:08:06.780
There have been many ups and downs.

1356
02:08:07,190 --> 02:08:08.260
One last question.

1357
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:09.360
What next?

1358
02:08:11,630 --> 02:08:12.630
What do I say?

1359
02:08:14,640 --> 02:08:16.020
They shut down the mills...

1360
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:19.660
The value of man dropped while the
value of land increased.

1361
02:08:21,320 --> 02:08:24.480
Who built skyscrapers on the land...

1362
02:08:25,890 --> 02:08:27.540
...that we helped them vacate?

1363
02:08:28,260 --> 02:08:29.460
Who lives there now?

1364
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:32.580
 Leaders, businessmen... 

1365
02:08:33,830 --> 02:08:38.310
From those heights
they look down upon me and say...

1366
02:08:40,170 --> 02:08:42.130
That's the gangster.
