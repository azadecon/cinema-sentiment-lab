1
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:36,781
The armies of India and Pakistan...

2
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,148
have fought four wars in
the past sixty years...

3
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:45,152
but there are two government
agencies in these two countries...

4
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:47,585
that are at war every day...
every moment...

5
00:00:47,828 --> 00:00:51,161
India's RAW and Pakistan's ISI.

6
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:56,361
The common man does not get
any news about these agencies...

7
00:00:56,837 --> 00:00:58,896
because in the name
of national security

8
00:00:58,972 --> 00:01:00,564
all information is forever guarded.

9
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:06,476
But there are some stories that
escape these walls and office files.

10
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:09,176
This is the story that shook...

11
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:11,649
...the very foundations
of this secretive world.

12
00:01:13,854 --> 00:01:15,185
This is the story of

13
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:16,313
Tiger...

14
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:30,814
Goodbye...

15
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:45,996
Tiger?

16
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:01,414
Hello... hello...
Those people are here.

17
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:03,353
I told you they would find me!

18
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:05,821
They found me!

19
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:08,986
You've kept me here for over a
month... now get me out of here!

20
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:11,893
Tell me quickly...
what should I do? Tell me... okay...

21
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:13,489
I'll get there... you get there too!

22
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:15,721
You're panting like a dog...
how much do you smoke?

23
00:05:16,663 --> 00:05:19,757
I can't believe you sold
out to them, Rabinder...

24
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:24,502
How much did the ISI pay?

25
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:27,165
Tiger... how much does
the government job pay us?

26
00:05:30,176 --> 00:05:32,041
What is the going price
for buying agents these days?

27
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:35,441
It's a lot, Tiger! Trust me...
there is a lot of money!

28
00:05:35,782 --> 00:05:40,549
Should be... after all you
sold information to the ISI...

29
00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:44,517
the guys who kill our
agents almost every day.

30
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:46,456
So? Even we smash those guys.

31
00:05:46,526 --> 00:05:51,122
How many ISI men have you
killed in your career alone?

32
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:55,023
This is a game, Tiger...
we are the smallest pawns in it.

33
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:56,193
Please understand...

34
00:05:59,072 --> 00:06:01,006
I'll show you...

35
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:07,479
Look at this, Tiger!

36
00:06:07,547 --> 00:06:11,210
Just see... will RAW
ever give us this?

37
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,854
Just see this, Tiger...

38
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:20,825
This is... almost two months' salary.

39
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:22,555
What good is it, Tiger?

40
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:26,497
One fine day we'll end up dead...
in some obscure part of the world...

41
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:29,034
and no one will come
to claim our bodies.

42
00:06:29,102 --> 00:06:31,229
Come with me, Tiger...
there's a lot of money to be made...

43
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:33,499
there's nothing in all these issues.

44
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:38,969
Sorry, Rabinder...

45
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:42,873
you will have to come with me...

46
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:44,007
I'm not going, Tiger!

47
00:06:44,084 --> 00:06:45,847
I won't go with you...
I'm telling you, I won't.

48
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:48,111
Alive...

49
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:51,081
or dead.

50
00:12:48,214 --> 00:12:49,875
He's back!

51
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:51,007
The hero returns...

52
00:12:51,084 --> 00:12:52,881
He has shown up after many days.

53
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:55,079
Hey, look... He's back again...

54
00:12:57,623 --> 00:12:59,147
Why are you so happy?

55
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:03,028
I'm not happy. I'm just telling you.

56
00:13:03,162 --> 00:13:04,561
Look at his face...

57
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,154
He must have been in a brawl.

58
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:07,597
He goes missing for months...

59
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:10,227
how can you even think of getting him
married to our dear Bablee?

60
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:14,906
Why are you staring at him?

61
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:16,299
I'm not staring at him.

62
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,603
Do your exercise!

63
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:19,271
But what does he do?

64
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:20,642
How the hell should I know?

65
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,914
But he's a Grade 1 officer.

66
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:46,004
Hello, sonny... it's nine already...

67
00:13:46,072 --> 00:13:47,437
...let me give you a
lift to the office.

68
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:48,599
Thank you, Mr Bagga.

69
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:49,999
Come...

70
00:13:50,076 --> 00:13:51,941
I had a briefing
with Mr Shenoy at nine.

71
00:13:52,545 --> 00:13:54,945
Oh... Mr Shenoy is extremely punctual.

72
00:13:58,217 --> 00:14:01,050
Sir... Rabinder was kept
near Iraq's Northern border...

73
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:04,256
I had information that the
ISI might move him any time.

74
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:06,149
We caught him at the right time.

75
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:07,453
Good Job, Tiger.

76
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:08,585
Thank you, Sir...

77
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:09,958
As usual...

78
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,691
Submit the full report to Tiwari.

79
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:14,023
Yes, Sir.

80
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:17,564
Tiger...
- Yes, Sir?

81
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:19,971
Your face is badly bruised.

82
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:22,035
Why don't you go on
leave and rest for a bit?

83
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:23,973
Sir... I'll be fine
in a couple of days...

84
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:25,271
Why do I need to go on leave?

85
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:28,404
You've been on assignments
back to back for 12 years now.

86
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:29,971
That's way too long.

87
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:32,284
Don't tempt fate.

88
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:34,182
Sir, one fine day I'll find
myself posted to a desk job,

89
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,488
reading files... just like you do.

90
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,048
Alright...

91
00:14:39,325 --> 00:14:41,657
as soon as you look normal again

92
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:43,422
you can leave for
your next assignment.

93
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,388
Where, Sir?

94
00:14:45,598 --> 00:14:48,499
Why don't you treat me
to your famous daal...

95
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:52,528
then I'll find you an
enemy in a new country.

96
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:53,663
Done, Sir.

97
00:14:57,076 --> 00:14:59,601
Sir... I often get this feeling that

98
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,479
you hired me at RAW
purely for my cooking skills.

99
00:15:03,616 --> 00:15:06,312
You're right...
for your cooking skills...

100
00:15:06,385 --> 00:15:08,080
and your insanity.

101
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:11,352
How do you live like this, Tiger?

102
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:13,649
This decade old furniture,

103
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:16,695
no pictures or books or anything?

104
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:21,022
Your salary has been lying untouched

105
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,091
in the agency's salary
account for the last 8 years...

106
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:24,694
why?

107
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:27,434
How can I spend when I'm never here?

108
00:15:27,506 --> 00:15:29,030
I have been
traveling all over the world

109
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:31,099
for the past 12 years
on government funds.

110
00:15:31,177 --> 00:15:34,169
Wow... how much have you saved?

111
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:37,582
About 2.3 million...

112
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:43,518
But your money will rot
in the agency's bank...

113
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:49,356
No, Sir... the day I retire from
this job... I'll blow it all up.

114
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:55,066
Why didn't you ever have a girlfriend?

115
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:57,067
Sir, how could I have one?

116
00:15:57,737 --> 00:16:01,434
Firstly I'm never here... and
secondly this goddamn job...

117
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:04,340
What's wrong with the job?

118
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,603
Sir... we have no
answers when someone asks

119
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:09,807
What do you do?

120
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:11,076
I'm in the civil service...

121
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,084
What exactly is your job?
I'm in administration...

122
00:16:13,152 --> 00:16:14,210
What is your duty?

123
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:15,811
Government duty...
- But what do you do?

124
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:17,146
Nothing as of now...

125
00:16:17,623 --> 00:16:20,820
Sir... sometimes I feel
like screaming and saying...

126
00:16:20,893 --> 00:16:22,485
I'm a spy... a RAW Agent!!

127
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:23,755
Spy... Secret Agent!!

128
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:25,524
I'm James Bond!!

129
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,135
Sir... I still have time...
what about you...

130
00:16:31,103 --> 00:16:32,570
why didn't you ever get married?

131
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:37,337
When I was young...
I was a bit of a poet...

132
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:43,472
and poets don't settle for arranged
marriages... they look for love.

133
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:45,843
Did you find love, Sir?

134
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:49,614
Yes... I did... once...

135
00:16:50,523 --> 00:16:51,581
Wow!

136
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:54,851
Who was she, Sir?

137
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:01,757
Well... she was this
sweet simple girl...

138
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:10,140
When I met her... I wanted
to live my life only for her.

139
00:17:12,678 --> 00:17:13,736
And then?

140
00:17:15,214 --> 00:17:20,151
Then... my goddamn duty got in the way

141
00:17:20,753 --> 00:17:25,520
And you chose your duty over love?

142
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:30,159
Of course... isn't that
what we're trained for?

143
00:17:31,697 --> 00:17:35,497
But do you ever regret it, Sir?

144
00:17:36,836 --> 00:17:40,829
Every day, Tiger... every single day.

145
00:17:48,781 --> 00:17:51,511
Hello... yes, Nambiar.

146
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,181
Right, right... thank you.

147
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:01,587
It seems we've found
you your next mission.

148
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:04,253
Cheers, Sir!

149
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:08,199
Between India and Pakistan...

150
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:12,667
only India has an
anti-missile system that

151
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:17,869
can stop incoming Pakistani
missiles to a large extent.

152
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:21,936
And one man has played a
big role in developing it...

153
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:25,342
Professor Anwar Jamaal Kidwai...

154
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:28,615
a scientist who is well
known all over the world...

155
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:32,348
but he's a maverick...
that's why he quit his government job

156
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:35,917
and started teaching at the famous
Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland.

157
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:40,356
But for the last few months
we suspect that Professor Kidwai

158
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:44,233
has been sharing his research
findings with other scientists...

159
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:48,500
who could be working for the
Pakistan defence establishment.

160
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:54,570
So I must stop him?

161
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:59,944
No, Tiger... like I said,
we only suspect him.

162
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:03,249
All you need to do is observe him.

163
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:05,314
Tiger...

164
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:08,326
Please don't kill anyone here.

165
00:19:08,394 --> 00:19:09,452
Right, Sir...

166
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:13,592
Every mission of yours...
someone gets killed.

167
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:17,564
Please just observe him... okay?

168
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:19,001
Okay, Sir.

169
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:37,883
Professor Kidwai...
what an honour to meet you.

170
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:42,424
I park there every day...
it's my spot.

171
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:43,553
Sure, Sir.

172
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:51,027
Professor Kidwai...

173
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:53,737
Professor! Professor Kidwai?

174
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:55,667
No time, no time.

175
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:00,636
Pleasure meeting you

176
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:51,086
Good afternoon, Professor Kidwai!

177
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,722
Hello!

178
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:55,358
Professor... I have to speak
with you about something important.

179
00:20:55,701 --> 00:20:57,430
Sorry, I've got to feed the dog.

180
00:20:57,503 --> 00:20:59,494
After feeding doggy?

181
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:01,371
I won't take too much of your time...

182
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,766
Sorry!

183
00:21:04,977 --> 00:21:07,377
This professor is a nutcase.

184
00:21:12,051 --> 00:21:14,383
Professor... Professor...

185
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:16,384
Professor... I won't
take up too much time.

186
00:21:17,856 --> 00:21:19,585
Sorry... got to take Rocket out.

187
00:21:19,658 --> 00:21:21,125
Shall I wait here?

188
00:21:22,394 --> 00:21:23,554
Rocket!

189
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:40,136
Rocket!

190
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:43,206
There's one girl who has
access to the professor's house...

191
00:22:44,076 --> 00:22:48,035
a British girl of
Indian origin... Zoya.

192
00:22:48,747 --> 00:22:51,773
A student of Trinity
Dance Academy for a year now.

193
00:22:52,551 --> 00:22:55,486
And a part-time
caretaker of his house.

194
00:22:55,554 --> 00:22:57,078
Get out! You really cannot be here.

195
00:22:57,156 --> 00:22:59,090
Sorry. I'm sorry. Relax...
I really didn't mean to. Excuse...

196
00:22:59,158 --> 00:23:00,216
Will you please leave!

197
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,097
You're still here?

198
00:23:15,174 --> 00:23:16,505
Yes... waiting for the mad professor.

199
00:23:18,577 --> 00:23:21,239
Next time ring the bell...
or I'll get you arrested.

200
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:22,905
Sorry, Miss...

201
00:23:22,981 --> 00:23:24,039
Does he know you?

202
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:26,917
No... I have come from India.

203
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:30,817
It's difficult to say
when he'll be back...

204
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:34,116
This is his house, right?

205
00:23:35,194 --> 00:23:38,186
Yes... but he goes for
long walks with Rocket.

206
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:41,690
Hope he hasn't gone to London.

207
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:44,827
I've just come from there...
I could have met him there.

208
00:23:48,874 --> 00:23:51,536
I'm sorry... he's troubled me all day.

209
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,137
Very funny.

210
00:23:57,883 --> 00:24:01,284
Excuse me...
I don't know anyone here...

211
00:24:01,887 --> 00:24:03,252
is there a hotel around somewhere?

212
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:08,124
They're on my way... come on.

213
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:10,627
We've not been introduced as yet...

214
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,996
I'm Zoya... Friends call me Zee.

215
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:18,967
I'm Manish Chandra...
My friends call me Doordarshan.

216
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:21,163
What?

217
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,673
Zee... Doordarshan?

218
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,036
That was a terrible joke.

219
00:24:29,648 --> 00:24:33,175
Sorry... it was seriously rotten.

220
00:24:37,923 --> 00:24:38,981
Check this one.

221
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:43,855
Excuse me... do you have any rooms?

222
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:45,658
Yes I believe we do, Sir...

223
00:24:45,731 --> 00:24:47,926
Thank you. Looking very lovely today.

224
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,058
Thank you.

225
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:54,196
No rooms.

226
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,268
Try here.

227
00:25:03,682 --> 00:25:04,740
Good evening.

228
00:25:04,817 --> 00:25:05,875
Good evening, Sir...

229
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:08,345
Can I help you?

230
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:10,213
My name is Manish Chandra.

231
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:13,283
Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

232
00:25:18,297 --> 00:25:19,628
This hotel is over-booked.

233
00:25:20,232 --> 00:25:22,359
Okay... listen... my hostel is here...

234
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:25,096
but there are a couple of hotels
ahead... try them if you like.

235
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,797
Sure... thank you.

236
00:26:22,027 --> 00:26:24,018
Not from there... come this way...

237
00:26:24,096 --> 00:26:25,154
Which way?

238
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,288
Climb the pipe...

239
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,091
This pipe?

240
00:26:43,782 --> 00:26:45,841
It's wet... slippery.

241
00:26:47,052 --> 00:26:48,883
Wait... I'll get something for you...

242
00:26:48,954 --> 00:26:50,012
Okay...

243
00:26:57,796 --> 00:26:58,854
Take this.

244
00:27:05,804 --> 00:27:06,862
How?

245
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:08,797
I've got a good grip.

246
00:27:08,874 --> 00:27:11,468
Okay... give me 100 Euros...

247
00:27:12,945 --> 00:27:14,003
A hundred Euros?

248
00:27:14,813 --> 00:27:15,939
What exactly do you do?

249
00:27:17,816 --> 00:27:19,181
Do you want to sleep
in that room or not?

250
00:27:20,085 --> 00:27:24,146
My friend stays there, but she
is out of town... hundred Euros?

251
00:27:24,222 --> 00:27:27,020
But 100 Euros is a lot...
that's more expensive than hotels.

252
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:29,754
Okay... then sleep on the bench.

253
00:27:31,296 --> 00:27:33,287
Okay, okay... but...

254
00:27:33,365 --> 00:27:37,301
can you take it yourself...
inside the jacket pocket.

255
00:27:43,108 --> 00:27:44,166
Thanks.
- Welcome

256
00:27:47,312 --> 00:27:48,438
What do you do?

257
00:27:49,247 --> 00:27:50,771
Me?

258
00:28:01,193 --> 00:28:03,218
I'm a writer.

259
00:28:03,295 --> 00:28:04,990
What's your business
with the Professor?

260
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:08,798
I'm writing a book on
the finest Indian minds...

261
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:12,428
and Professor Kidwai
happens to be one of them.

262
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:15,003
So, you're here to
interview the professor?

263
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:21,073
If you interview me later,
that will be a huge help.

264
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:24,047
Yes... why are you
standing on that pipe?

265
00:28:26,418 --> 00:28:28,113
Go ahead... good night.

266
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:40,289
What?

267
00:28:44,836 --> 00:28:45,894
Can you cook?

268
00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:52,939
Not bad... for an Indian man.

269
00:28:54,112 --> 00:28:55,170
Are you married?

270
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,474
Straightaway marriage? Won't you
ask me first if I have a girlfriend?

271
00:28:59,518 --> 00:29:03,579
No... I think you're old
enough to be married now.

272
00:29:04,322 --> 00:29:07,257
No... I'm not married yet.

273
00:29:08,393 --> 00:29:09,451
Why?

274
00:29:29,147 --> 00:29:30,239
I don't get to meet nice girls.

275
00:29:31,483 --> 00:29:33,280
What are you looking for, Mr. Writer?

276
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:35,613
Nothing much...

277
00:29:35,954 --> 00:29:39,890
Just a sweet simple girl...

278
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:47,956
Someone who'd make me
want to live only for her.

279
00:29:50,502 --> 00:29:53,903
Wow... very romantic...

280
00:29:53,972 --> 00:29:56,202
but you're a bit of a
bumpkin when it comes to style.

281
00:29:56,274 --> 00:29:58,640
Really? This is the first
time someone has called me that.

282
00:29:59,177 --> 00:30:00,269
What? A bumpkin?

283
00:30:01,246 --> 00:30:02,941
No... romantic.

284
00:30:03,014 --> 00:30:04,641
And you've been
called a bumpkin before?

285
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:07,916
No... that's a first as well.

286
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:11,250
Good night Mr Writer.
- Good night, Zoya.

287
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:14,084
The 100 Euros were for
this pass... a play that

288
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:17,393
I'm going to choreograph...
Professor Kidwai sponsors it.

289
00:30:17,462 --> 00:30:18,520
Your breakfast, Sir.

290
00:30:20,532 --> 00:30:26,061
Excuse me... can you puncture
the yellow and make it solid?

291
00:30:27,506 --> 00:30:28,564
Okay. - Thank you

292
00:30:29,474 --> 00:30:30,532
What happened?

293
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:32,943
Aren't you a little
fussy when it comes to food?

294
00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:34,069
Maybe a little.

295
00:30:37,182 --> 00:30:40,310
So you want to spend some
time with Professor Kidwai?

296
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:43,554
Yes... so that I get
to know him better.

297
00:30:43,622 --> 00:30:46,420
I'll try to speak to him...

298
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:48,949
come to his house tomorrow morning.

299
00:30:49,494 --> 00:30:50,688
But I can't promise anything.

300
00:30:51,163 --> 00:30:52,221
No problem.

301
00:30:53,532 --> 00:30:54,692
Just the way you like it, Sir.

302
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:56,225
Thank you.

303
00:30:56,301 --> 00:30:57,427
And here's the cheque.

304
00:30:58,036 --> 00:30:59,094
Whenever you are ready.

305
00:30:59,971 --> 00:31:04,374
I hope you don't mind if I leave
you alone with your punctured eggs.

306
00:31:04,442 --> 00:31:06,535
I'm getting late for my
play rehearsal. See you later.

307
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:11,976
You pay the bill... why should I?

308
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:15,577
Yes, of course...

309
00:31:15,654 --> 00:31:17,485
you keep puncturing eggs to eat them

310
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:19,984
and make the Indian
government pay for it.

311
00:31:21,493 --> 00:31:24,656
Manish Chandra...
isn't that a boring name?

312
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,558
I wanted a boring name...

313
00:31:27,265 --> 00:31:30,598
should sound like a
decent guy... right?

314
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:32,466
Look at her gorgeous hair... fire!

315
00:31:34,673 --> 00:31:36,004
Okay 'decent guy', listen...

316
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:38,008
you'll have to get
close to the professor now.

317
00:31:38,343 --> 00:31:41,005
I'm thinking... people
here are so honest...

318
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:43,013
they don't even bolt their doors...

319
00:31:43,081 --> 00:31:44,673
I should barge into
the professor's house

320
00:31:44,749 --> 00:31:46,011
and just run off with his computer.

321
00:31:46,084 --> 00:31:47,142
Oh, no...

322
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:51,350
Shenoy Sir has clearly
instructed we don't need his computer

323
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:54,017
All we need to do is keep
an eye on what he does...

324
00:31:54,092 --> 00:31:55,491
who he meets... who he speaks to...

325
00:31:56,094 --> 00:31:57,755
The Professor is a nutcase...

326
00:31:58,363 --> 00:32:00,627
I'm thinking of entering his
house with the girl's help...

327
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:02,396
she's calling me tomorrow morning.

328
00:32:03,168 --> 00:32:04,226
Good plan.

329
00:32:09,374 --> 00:32:10,432
Is he there?

330
00:32:10,508 --> 00:32:11,566
Maybe...

331
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:15,069
Sir, I'm writing a book on
the finest Indian minds...

332
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,271
I'm just a mad scientist...

333
00:32:19,117 --> 00:32:21,108
at least this is what the
Indian Government thinks...

334
00:32:21,253 --> 00:32:23,278
No, Sir... you are being modest.

335
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:26,056
Okay... if you insist.

336
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:28,492
Tell me what will I have to do?

337
00:32:28,693 --> 00:32:33,426
Sir, I want to spend the
maximum time possible with you.

338
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:34,790
It will be good for the book.

339
00:32:34,866 --> 00:32:38,063
For example, when you
make your morning notes...

340
00:32:38,136 --> 00:32:41,731
then I can be with you
when you leave for college...

341
00:32:41,806 --> 00:32:45,708
I can be with you in your
office observing your work...

342
00:32:45,777 --> 00:32:47,074
seeing your research...

343
00:32:47,145 --> 00:32:51,775
We can talk in your house
when you come back home...

344
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:57,110
just observe you and be around you,
Sir... like a constant companion.

345
00:32:59,157 --> 00:33:06,791
Mr Chandra, are you here to
write a book on me or to marry me?

346
00:33:12,837 --> 00:33:16,273
Zoya, why does this damn Rocket
launch himself when he sees me?

347
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:19,208
Hey... don't say that...
Rocket is very sweet.

348
00:33:19,678 --> 00:33:21,111
But he keeps barking at me.

349
00:33:21,346 --> 00:33:23,177
That's because you swore at him.

350
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:25,472
Hey... but I said it in front of you.

351
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,408
Don't you like dogs?

352
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:38,125
No... I do like them.

353
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,188
Good.

354
00:33:41,232 --> 00:33:43,325
Zoya... your hostel.

355
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:46,134
Yes... bye.

356
00:33:46,604 --> 00:33:50,131
Zoya... do you want to...

357
00:33:51,142 --> 00:33:52,200
like... have dinner?

358
00:33:53,878 --> 00:33:56,676
Mr. Writer... are you
asking me out on a date?

359
00:33:56,815 --> 00:33:57,873
Date?

360
00:33:58,516 --> 00:34:00,848
No... I mean... we can have a meal...

361
00:34:05,223 --> 00:34:06,690
I'm going out with my friends tonight.

362
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:09,589
Join us... I'll let you pay the bill.

363
00:34:09,894 --> 00:34:11,156
Sure.

364
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:15,894
But I hope you won't
turn up like this?

365
00:34:17,802 --> 00:34:18,860
Like what?

366
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:23,273
You know... dressed like a bumpkin.

367
00:34:24,843 --> 00:34:26,174
Just get a little cooler...

368
00:34:29,581 --> 00:34:31,173
Keep your foot behind that line.

369
00:34:42,193 --> 00:34:43,251
Hey, everybody!!

370
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,922
Guys listen... this is my
friend Manish... he's from India.

371
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:47,789
Hey Manish, it's your turn...

372
00:34:49,934 --> 00:34:52,198
Have you ever thrown darts?

373
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:07,543
Hello...

374
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:10,514
Dude... all three hit bull's-eye!

375
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:12,720
Are you a writer or James Bond?

376
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:14,315
I know... I know...
won't happen again.

377
00:35:14,492 --> 00:35:16,756
This girl is
affecting you, my friend...

378
00:35:17,796 --> 00:35:19,627
Don't be silly...
it's a part of my job.

379
00:35:19,964 --> 00:35:21,955
Fine... and don't drink too much.

380
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:26,962
Okay... mummy dear... bye

381
00:35:27,572 --> 00:35:29,870
Oh, so sweet... was that
your mother on the line?

382
00:35:34,979 --> 00:35:37,345
Come on, guys... we're
going to Mike's party.

383
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,408
Do you wanna come?
- No, no...

384
00:35:40,485 --> 00:35:41,543
Come on, ya... it will be fun...

385
00:35:41,686 --> 00:35:43,779
No... you enjoy... you go.

386
00:35:45,356 --> 00:35:46,914
You guys carry on...
I'll see you later.

387
00:35:46,991 --> 00:35:48,754
Okay, bye! Cheers!

388
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:49,885
Bye!

389
00:35:49,961 --> 00:35:51,258
Hey, but please don't
stay because of me...

390
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:53,661
Why? Now you don't
want to pay for my dinner?

391
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,399
No, not Ree... Dee...

392
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:01,897
Ta-ng-dee

393
00:36:01,973 --> 00:36:03,270
Tang-Ree

394
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:04,931
Tang... Tang-dee...

395
00:36:05,276 --> 00:36:07,267
That's what I said... Tang-ree

396
00:36:07,345 --> 00:36:09,279
Do as I say... bend
your tongue upwards

397
00:36:09,347 --> 00:36:12,373
and touch it to the roof of
your mouth... like this...

398
00:36:14,018 --> 00:36:20,014
and now hit your front two
Bugs Bunny teeth with it... Dee!

399
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:21,383
Ree...

400
00:36:22,494 --> 00:36:24,291
Dee...
- Tang-dee... - Correct!

401
00:36:24,362 --> 00:36:25,420
See... right?

402
00:36:25,497 --> 00:36:26,691
Now place the order...
- Okay...

403
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:29,323
Two... Tang-ree kebabs

404
00:36:29,968 --> 00:36:32,436
Go ahead, my friend...
get Tang-ree kebabs...

405
00:36:32,904 --> 00:36:33,962
No problem, Sir.

406
00:36:35,507 --> 00:36:39,341
You know what?
You don't look like a writer.

407
00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:45,674
For example...

408
00:36:45,984 --> 00:36:48,316
your hands...
they are not like a writer's...

409
00:36:48,653 --> 00:36:51,622
they're cut and
bruised like a wrestler's.

410
00:36:52,557 --> 00:36:54,047
Why did you become a writer?

411
00:36:56,361 --> 00:36:59,057
Just followed my heart.

412
00:36:59,764 --> 00:37:03,757
Very few people follow
their hearts... you're lucky.

413
00:37:06,437 --> 00:37:09,565
The most important
thing for an agent is...

414
00:37:09,741 --> 00:37:13,336
that he should use his
head and not his heart.

415
00:37:13,778 --> 00:37:18,909
The day you follow your heart,
consider yourself dead.

416
00:37:21,419 --> 00:37:23,353
I admire a man who follows his heart.

417
00:37:26,624 --> 00:37:27,818
Tang-dee kabab for you, Sir...

418
00:37:28,493 --> 00:37:31,951
and ma'am... for you Tang-ree...
enjoy.

419
00:37:34,098 --> 00:37:36,089
What the hell, Gopi...
you kept coughing...

420
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:39,102
what if she saw you...
I've reached... I'll call you back.

421
00:37:58,389 --> 00:38:00,050
But Tiger... he could
have been a burglar.

422
00:38:00,124 --> 00:38:01,386
No, Gopi...

423
00:38:01,893 --> 00:38:05,522
the way he attacked me...
he was obviously trained.

424
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:10,398
Someone is reacting on
seeing me with the Professor.

425
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:11,729
Boss, things are not good here.

426
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,401
We'll have to wrap this up quickly.

427
00:38:13,571 --> 00:38:14,629
That's why we're here.

428
00:38:20,612 --> 00:38:21,670
How's this?

429
00:38:22,814 --> 00:38:23,872
What will you do with it?

430
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:26,007
It's a gift.

431
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:27,142
And it's a gift for whom?

432
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:29,611
For Zoya... to say thank you.

433
00:38:30,922 --> 00:38:31,980
Wow, Tiger!

434
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,481
You've used people all over
the world and discarded them

435
00:38:34,926 --> 00:38:36,518
since when have you
started saying thank you?

436
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:38,427
Gopi... this is a
different sort of a mission...

437
00:38:38,997 --> 00:38:40,430
here it's important to say thank you.

438
00:38:40,598 --> 00:38:41,656
Which mission?

439
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:43,598
Ours? Or have you
started another mission?

440
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:45,496
Stop your nonsense and tell
me what you think of this.

441
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:49,167
Isn't this too personal?

442
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:51,499
What?

443
00:38:51,576 --> 00:38:53,441
I mean... do you know her that
well that you can give her a dress?

444
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:54,705
I'm giving her a dress...
not taking it off.

445
00:39:07,025 --> 00:39:08,458
Tiger... you've never bought a gift...

446
00:39:08,526 --> 00:39:10,824
...for a girl ever in
your life... have you?

447
00:39:11,129 --> 00:39:12,187
Never.

448
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,688
Then what's going on here?

449
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:15,190
What?

450
00:39:15,466 --> 00:39:18,458
Hey... it's extremely important
to woo Zoya for this mission.

451
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:21,663
What?

452
00:39:21,873 --> 00:39:23,534
Don't get wooed
yourself in the process.

453
00:39:31,215 --> 00:39:32,477
Hi, Zoya...

454
00:39:33,718 --> 00:39:34,776
Hi...

455
00:39:35,486 --> 00:39:36,544
Hope you're not busy?

456
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:39,752
Lighting design for the show...

457
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,925
is that gift for me?

458
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:45,553
Yes.

459
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:49,057
Really? Is it really for me?

460
00:39:51,135 --> 00:39:52,898
Yes... but honestly this is the
first time I've given a gift to a girl.

461
00:39:53,071 --> 00:39:56,939
In these matters I'm a bit of a...
like you say... bumpkin.

462
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,502
That's really sweet of you...
can I open it now? - Yes.

463
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,521
How do you know that...

464
00:40:15,526 --> 00:40:19,690
Your room had so many
things with stars and stuff?

465
00:40:24,202 --> 00:40:25,260
You don't like it?

466
00:40:27,138 --> 00:40:29,834
No, Manish... I really like it...

467
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:33,738
Then why are you crying?

468
00:40:35,546 --> 00:40:36,774
It reminds me of someone...

469
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,086
Hey, Zoya, do you want to
give me the spotlight cue?

470
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:49,555
Yes, sure... just give me one second.

471
00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:55,956
Okay, switch on track number 9...
I'll show you the path.

472
00:40:59,971 --> 00:41:01,029
One second...

473
00:41:02,306 --> 00:41:05,275
Will you help me? I can't do it alone.

474
00:41:06,144 --> 00:41:07,236
But I don't know how to dance.

475
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:10,240
No one is asking you to dance.

476
00:41:10,982 --> 00:41:12,916
Just hold me and follow me.

477
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,982
Oh... come on.

478
00:42:08,806 --> 00:42:09,864
Manish...

479
00:42:12,944 --> 00:42:14,002
Music is over.

480
00:42:18,649 --> 00:42:19,707
What happened?

481
00:42:21,052 --> 00:42:22,110
My head is spinning.

482
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:52,115
Wanderer... Wanderer

483
00:42:52,183 --> 00:42:56,085
My heart's a wanderer

484
00:42:56,153 --> 00:42:57,882
From the moment I saw her

485
00:42:57,955 --> 00:43:00,014
My heart became a wanderer

486
00:43:00,191 --> 00:43:01,954
Neither awake nor asleep

487
00:43:02,026 --> 00:43:03,823
My heart's a wanderer

488
00:43:04,095 --> 00:43:05,995
When she smiles

489
00:43:06,063 --> 00:43:07,963
I forget everything

490
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:11,896
See... My heart has gone wayward

491
00:43:11,969 --> 00:43:15,700
Wanderer... Wanderer

492
00:43:15,773 --> 00:43:17,866
For her melodies

493
00:43:17,942 --> 00:43:20,206
My heart became a wanderer

494
00:43:27,919 --> 00:43:31,719
Wanderer... Wanderer

495
00:43:31,856 --> 00:43:33,881
For her melodies

496
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:38,361
My heart became a wanderer

497
00:44:20,004 --> 00:44:23,838
She breezes gently past my heart

498
00:44:27,979 --> 00:44:31,779
Her words are a mystery to me

499
00:44:33,517 --> 00:44:37,510
When she laughs...
colourful butterflies take flight

500
00:44:37,588 --> 00:44:41,524
It's like being struck by lightning

501
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:46,024
I have surrendered my heart

502
00:44:46,097 --> 00:44:49,794
Wanderer... Wanderer

503
00:44:49,934 --> 00:44:51,959
For her melodies

504
00:44:52,036 --> 00:44:56,166
My heart became a wanderer

505
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:07,540
Her words cast a magical spell

506
00:45:10,054 --> 00:45:13,546
Her words cast a magical spell

507
00:45:13,624 --> 00:45:17,822
Her eyes are an artist's delight

508
00:45:18,429 --> 00:45:23,560
I've dreamt a hundred dreams about her

509
00:45:23,634 --> 00:45:27,570
And still I'm restless to see her

510
00:45:28,272 --> 00:45:32,003
I would give up the world for her

511
00:45:32,076 --> 00:45:35,842
Wanderer... Wanderer

512
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,105
For her melodies

513
00:45:38,182 --> 00:45:40,150
My heart became a wanderer

514
00:45:40,217 --> 00:45:43,846
Wanderer... Wanderer

515
00:45:44,021 --> 00:45:45,989
For her melodies

516
00:45:46,057 --> 00:45:50,858
My heart became a wanderer

517
00:45:57,902 --> 00:45:58,960
What are you doing?

518
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:00,128
What am I doing?

519
00:46:02,073 --> 00:46:03,131
Were you just dancing?

520
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:05,199
Dancing?

521
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:12,078
Are you crazy? Who was dancing?

522
00:46:13,417 --> 00:46:15,578
Forget the girl...
get Rocket. Let's go.

523
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,282
One damned dog has made
a kitten out of Tiger.

524
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:20,948
Bloody mouse!

525
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,169
Zoya... will you come
out with me tonight?

526
00:46:38,242 --> 00:46:40,039
Why are you running?
- Because you're on a cycle.

527
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,038
What happened?

528
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:46,474
Can we meet tonight?

529
00:46:46,984 --> 00:46:48,042
Tonight?

530
00:46:48,252 --> 00:46:50,379
Tonight... tonight is very important.

531
00:46:51,088 --> 00:46:54,524
Mr. Writer... so you are
asking me out on a date?

532
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,118
Yes, Zoya Zee...

533
00:46:59,597 --> 00:47:00,655
When and where?

534
00:47:01,198 --> 00:47:02,927
Central Park... at 11 sharp...

535
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,458
At 11?

536
00:47:04,535 --> 00:47:08,335
11 p.m. Is very important.

537
00:47:12,543 --> 00:47:13,601
Okay.

538
00:47:18,949 --> 00:47:20,007
Rocket?

539
00:47:22,553 --> 00:47:23,611
Hey!

540
00:47:25,189 --> 00:47:26,417
Don't misbehave with elders!

541
00:47:28,025 --> 00:47:30,323
Hey... if you bite me
your teeth will break.

542
00:47:31,228 --> 00:47:32,957
Good boy, Rocket...

543
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:38,964
Good boy, Rocket... good boy...

544
00:47:39,236 --> 00:47:40,669
Good boy, Rocket...

545
00:47:44,108 --> 00:47:45,166
Hi...

546
00:47:45,409 --> 00:47:47,969
Have you got Professor
Kidwai for the date as well?

547
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,980
I told you I'd get you to be
friends with Rocket... see...

548
00:47:52,283 --> 00:47:54,979
it's done... now
he'll never bark at you.

549
00:47:55,352 --> 00:47:57,718
Zoya Zee... come, I want
to show you something...

550
00:47:57,988 --> 00:47:59,285
Come Rocket, come, come.

551
00:48:00,324 --> 00:48:01,382
What?

552
00:48:05,596 --> 00:48:09,464
How sweet... so you
called me here to see this?

553
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:43,359
Such a meteor shower happens
only once in 20-25 years...

554
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:48,338
do you know when the
last such shower was?

555
00:48:51,442 --> 00:48:53,307
16th June 1991...

556
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:56,302
at 11:55...

557
00:48:58,782 --> 00:49:00,249
I was 6 years old...

558
00:49:02,253 --> 00:49:04,653
my father had an old Willy's jeep...

559
00:49:06,523 --> 00:49:08,787
we would drive out of the city...

560
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:11,719
to see stars...

561
00:49:14,465 --> 00:49:17,059
He would tell me that watching stars

562
00:49:17,134 --> 00:49:19,068
makes people happy...

563
00:49:21,338 --> 00:49:26,366
because all your loved ones
eventually become stars in the sky...

564
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:29,770
and bless us from up there.

565
00:49:31,482 --> 00:49:34,713
As a child I used to
enjoy hearing such stories.

566
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:39,683
Zee, where is your father?

567
00:49:55,306 --> 00:49:56,364
Which one?

568
00:50:04,448 --> 00:50:06,279
That one...

569
00:50:07,117 --> 00:50:10,416
Wow... right next to my father.

570
00:50:15,859 --> 00:50:17,292
What was your father's name?

571
00:50:19,797 --> 00:50:20,855
Nazar Jung...

572
00:50:27,871 --> 00:50:29,133
Nazar, Sir...

573
00:50:29,406 --> 00:50:30,600
What shall I hide from you...

574
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:32,568
you are seeing
everything from there...

575
00:50:33,344 --> 00:50:34,777
after all, your name means sight.

576
00:50:35,346 --> 00:50:38,372
Honestly... I'm a little
slow in certain matters...

577
00:50:38,782 --> 00:50:42,149
I think that's why your
daughter calls me a bumpkin.

578
00:50:42,886 --> 00:50:45,286
Honestly... I want to convey
something to your daughter...

579
00:50:45,689 --> 00:50:48,658
but I don't know how to...

580
00:50:49,626 --> 00:50:53,756
So, Mr Nazar, what should I do
according to you... any tips?

581
00:50:54,398 --> 00:50:55,456
Manish...

582
00:50:58,302 --> 00:50:59,769
What do you want to tell me?

583
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,618
Hey, caveman...

584
00:52:00,564 --> 00:52:01,622
Is everything alright?

585
00:52:01,698 --> 00:52:02,756
I need a drink.

586
00:52:07,471 --> 00:52:08,563
What the hell are you saying?

587
00:52:09,506 --> 00:52:10,768
Can't people like us fall in love?

588
00:52:11,975 --> 00:52:13,442
Of course we can...
but not on a mission.

589
00:52:14,912 --> 00:52:16,243
When are we not on a mission?

590
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,707
And do we have a life
beyond these missions or not?

591
00:52:20,551 --> 00:52:21,609
Mission!

592
00:52:24,755 --> 00:52:25,813
Is Zoya also?

593
00:52:27,324 --> 00:52:29,451
Zoya likes that
writer Manish Chandra...

594
00:52:29,993 --> 00:52:31,984
I am neither Manish...
nor am I a writer...

595
00:52:32,863 --> 00:52:33,921
who am I?

596
00:52:34,531 --> 00:52:35,998
I've changed so many names

597
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,662
that I don't even remember
what my parents named me.

598
00:52:39,937 --> 00:52:41,404
What are you saying, Tiger?

599
00:52:42,272 --> 00:52:43,762
Tiger... Tiger... Tiger...

600
00:52:44,274 --> 00:52:46,003
Shenoy Sir called me that once...

601
00:52:46,643 --> 00:52:47,837
and now everyone calls me that.

602
00:52:48,779 --> 00:52:50,269
Tiger is a name meant for dogs.

603
00:52:51,849 --> 00:52:55,683
I warned you... in
an attempt to woo her

604
00:52:56,653 --> 00:52:57,711
don't get wooed
yourself in the process.

605
00:52:59,456 --> 00:53:00,514
Say thank you now...

606
00:53:07,531 --> 00:53:08,759
Should I tell you something...

607
00:53:10,467 --> 00:53:11,525
You've chosen a nice
girl (sister-in-law)...

608
00:53:17,975 --> 00:53:20,000
It's five in the morning...
get some sleep...

609
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:22,301
it's her play in the evening.

610
00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:40,387
Sorry...

611
00:53:42,533 --> 00:53:43,591
Sorry...

612
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:54,868
Excuse me?

613
00:58:57,247 --> 00:58:58,737
In ten minutes you've
destroyed half of Dublin...

614
00:58:58,815 --> 00:59:00,646
and that agent got away too...
what the hell are you doing, Tiger?

615
00:59:00,717 --> 00:59:01,775
What else could I have
done in that situation?

616
00:59:02,652 --> 00:59:04,051
And that guy would have come
to know that I'm not a writer.

617
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,247
Not just him... the whole town
will know you're not a writer.

618
00:59:08,658 --> 00:59:09,716
Where will the Professor be right now?

619
00:59:09,926 --> 00:59:11,052
Must be watching the play...
what else?

620
00:59:11,828 --> 00:59:12,886
Do one thing... you go there...

621
00:59:12,963 --> 00:59:14,021
...you'll stay safe
from the police as well.

622
00:59:14,097 --> 00:59:16,327
I'll speak to Shenoy Sir on a
secure line and then call you.

623
00:59:16,399 --> 00:59:18,663
Alright.
- Keep your phone on... - Alright.

624
00:59:18,802 --> 00:59:20,929
And listen... get your face fixed.

625
00:59:21,004 --> 00:59:22,266
Yes... I'll do that.

626
00:59:22,339 --> 00:59:24,398
And listen... keep this.

627
00:59:28,345 --> 00:59:29,403
Anything else?

628
00:59:30,046 --> 00:59:31,775
Not at all... after
destroying everything...

629
00:59:32,015 --> 00:59:33,744
You please go ahead and enjoy
the play with dear sister-in-law.

630
01:00:46,923 --> 01:00:47,981
Yes, Gopi?

631
01:00:48,191 --> 01:00:50,489
Tiger... there's some
activity at the Professor's house.

632
01:00:50,927 --> 01:00:52,394
But the Professor is here.

633
01:00:52,462 --> 01:00:54,430
That's what I'm saying...
you head there...

634
01:00:54,497 --> 01:00:56,465
there seems to be some trouble.
- Oh, shit!

635
01:01:44,547 --> 01:01:45,809
Put your hands behind your head...

636
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:48,308
turn around...

637
01:01:49,486 --> 01:01:50,544
slowly.

638
01:01:55,959 --> 01:01:57,017
Zoya...

639
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,492
But you were at the play?

640
01:02:15,445 --> 01:02:16,844
What business do you
have with the Professor?

641
01:02:16,913 --> 01:02:18,380
So, you're here to
interview the Professor?

642
01:02:18,448 --> 01:02:19,506
What do you do?

643
01:02:19,582 --> 01:02:20,844
You don't look like a writer.

644
01:02:21,851 --> 01:02:22,909
Oh my God!

645
01:02:23,586 --> 01:02:26,851
So you want to spend some
time with Professor Kidwai?

646
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:30,117
Agent...

647
01:02:32,195 --> 01:02:33,253
ISI... right?

648
01:02:41,137 --> 01:02:42,195
Get up...

649
01:03:04,928 --> 01:03:05,986
Sit down.

650
01:03:19,976 --> 01:03:21,273
You're an agent...

651
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:27,177
and clearly a very good one at that...

652
01:03:31,955 --> 01:03:33,513
so you must be aware...

653
01:03:35,258 --> 01:03:37,419
of what we do in such situations...

654
01:03:40,597 --> 01:03:42,326
still... I'll tell you...

655
01:03:47,003 --> 01:03:48,937
you have two options...

656
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:54,441
either you work with us...

657
01:03:56,946 --> 01:03:58,675
and give us all the information...

658
01:04:03,086 --> 01:04:04,144
or...

659
01:04:10,093 --> 01:04:11,253
I'll have to... right here...

660
01:04:13,463 --> 01:04:16,955
I will not betray my country...

661
01:04:20,637 --> 01:04:22,605
So that leaves me
with just one choice...

662
01:04:26,709 --> 01:04:27,971
and for you too.

663
01:05:09,052 --> 01:05:10,314
My name is not Manish...

664
01:05:12,155 --> 01:05:13,588
and I'm not a writer...

665
01:05:16,426 --> 01:05:17,757
besides these two things...

666
01:05:19,462 --> 01:05:21,327
everything I told you was true.

667
01:05:24,434 --> 01:05:26,425
All I want to know from you is...

668
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,601
what I saw in your eyes...

669
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:37,307
was that a lie too?

670
01:05:44,053 --> 01:05:46,283
I was just doing my job...

671
01:05:52,528 --> 01:05:53,620
and nothing else.

672
01:06:34,378 --> 01:06:38,007
Tiger... you end up killing
someone on every assignment...

673
01:06:38,582 --> 01:06:41,073
we didn't want this
on this assignment.

674
01:06:41,185 --> 01:06:43,210
Sir, the situation
was really bad there...

675
01:06:43,554 --> 01:06:45,886
it was either me or their agent.

676
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:48,220
Police found their agent's body...

677
01:06:48,793 --> 01:06:50,920
I hope you haven't left any trails?

678
01:06:50,995 --> 01:06:53,623
No, Sir... and I retrieved
the hard disk as well...

679
01:06:54,098 --> 01:06:55,497
I've submitted it to Joshi.

680
01:06:55,833 --> 01:06:57,425
File your report as well.

681
01:07:02,139 --> 01:07:03,299
Tiger...

682
01:07:05,443 --> 01:07:08,003
Are you ready for
your next assignment?

683
01:07:08,846 --> 01:07:11,542
Sir... I'm slightly
tired of field operations.

684
01:07:12,149 --> 01:07:13,616
If you deem it fit...

685
01:07:14,485 --> 01:07:16,749
you can assign me to a
desk job for a few days.

686
01:07:25,996 --> 01:07:28,328
I'm Zoya... friends call me Zee.

687
01:07:28,399 --> 01:07:29,991
I'm Manish Chandra.

688
01:07:30,401 --> 01:07:32,426
My friends call me Doordarshan.

689
01:07:34,905 --> 01:07:37,738
Touch it to the roof of
your mouth and hit it... Dee!

690
01:07:37,842 --> 01:07:39,036
Ree!

691
01:07:39,844 --> 01:07:40,674
Dee.

692
01:07:40,744 --> 01:07:41,802
Tang-dee...
- Correct?

693
01:07:41,879 --> 01:07:42,573
Right?

694
01:07:42,646 --> 01:07:43,874
Now place the order.

695
01:07:49,687 --> 01:07:52,451
Very few people have the
courage to follow their heart

696
01:07:53,124 --> 01:07:54,386
You are lucky.

697
01:08:12,643 --> 01:08:14,338
Hey, sonny!

698
01:08:14,812 --> 01:08:15,938
Yes, Mr. Bagga?

699
01:08:16,046 --> 01:08:18,480
Working hard? Where are
you planning to go now?

700
01:08:18,582 --> 01:08:19,947
Nowhere, Mr. Bagga...
Nothing is happening.

701
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:22,041
Come... let me drop you home then.

702
01:08:22,153 --> 01:08:22,915
Sure, let's go.
- Come

703
01:08:22,987 --> 01:08:24,113
You know, sonny...

704
01:08:24,188 --> 01:08:27,021
the UN Foreign Ministers' meeting
is about to take place in Istanbul.

705
01:08:27,091 --> 01:08:28,956
And we've intercepted a message that

706
01:08:29,059 --> 01:08:32,358
the Pakistani delegates are likely
to raise the Kashmir issue again.

707
01:08:32,429 --> 01:08:33,953
Ever since then...

708
01:08:34,031 --> 01:08:38,195
Mr. Shenoy has asked me to
monitor every known Pakistani source.

709
01:08:38,269 --> 01:08:44,265
And for the past 20 days these
random messages have messed up my mind.

710
01:08:44,675 --> 01:08:48,441
To make things worse... they have set
their codes based on our film stars.

711
01:08:48,546 --> 01:08:51,879
Tell me, who is supposed to be
Mallika Sherawat in the government?

712
01:08:51,949 --> 01:08:54,543
I understand if they say
Gulshan Grover or Amrish Puri.

713
01:08:54,652 --> 01:08:57,815
And not just films... they are
now into television as well.

714
01:08:57,888 --> 01:09:02,916
One message has been intercepted
every day for the past 20 days.

715
01:09:03,027 --> 01:09:06,360
That Zee TV will
surely cover the conference,

716
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:08,057
but will Doordarshan also be there?

717
01:09:08,165 --> 01:09:10,998
I just don't get it... what's
their connection with Doordarshan?

718
01:09:11,068 --> 01:09:12,695
Who watches Doordarshan in any case?

719
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:15,568
Mr. Bagga, I want to
see those intercepts now!

720
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:23,068
See... I intercept all this every day.

721
01:09:32,456 --> 01:09:35,118
Sonny... what are you
looking for? You need my help?

722
01:09:37,127 --> 01:09:39,527
You asked for a desk assignment...

723
01:09:39,597 --> 01:09:42,760
So why do you want to go
to Istanbul all of a sudden?

724
01:09:42,833 --> 01:09:46,291
Sir, you know that there are more spies
than diplomats in these conferences.

725
01:09:46,403 --> 01:09:48,598
Sir, there will be officials
from all over the world...

726
01:09:48,672 --> 01:09:51,232
Sir, it's a gold mine of
intelligence information.

727
01:09:52,076 --> 01:09:53,907
How can I miss this, Sir?

728
01:09:56,580 --> 01:10:00,949
Okay, Tiger... pull out your
suits and let's go to Istanbul!

729
01:10:27,044 --> 01:10:29,808
Expectations are high as the
Indian and Pakistan Foreign Ministers...

730
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:33,213
On the sidelines of the UN Foreign
Ministers' Meeting at Istanbul...

731
01:10:33,284 --> 01:10:36,947
It is anticipated that the
Indian and Pakistan foreign ministers

732
01:10:37,054 --> 01:10:39,147
may have an informal meeting.

733
01:10:39,256 --> 01:10:42,453
This is good news for the bilateral
relations of the two countries.

734
01:12:38,876 --> 01:12:43,040
Get out of here... my
people will arrive soon.

735
01:12:49,253 --> 01:12:50,618
Go...

736
01:12:52,122 --> 01:12:53,350
Go!

737
01:13:41,505 --> 01:13:42,665
Bored?

738
01:14:45,135 --> 01:14:46,898
Hey... who are you?

739
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:48,835
Don't worry, I'm a friend of her's.

740
01:14:48,939 --> 01:14:50,065
Drive towards the Old Town.

741
01:14:50,307 --> 01:14:51,501
Old Town... okay?

742
01:14:52,042 --> 01:14:53,270
Okay.

743
01:15:14,765 --> 01:15:16,426
Why have you called me here, Zoya?

744
01:15:19,236 --> 01:15:20,430
Tell me, Zoya.

745
01:15:20,704 --> 01:15:22,763
It was very easy for you
to put a gun to my head

746
01:15:22,839 --> 01:15:25,103
and tell me that you
love me... wasn't it?

747
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:26,539
As simple as that?

748
01:15:26,643 --> 01:15:28,668
If the gun was in your hand...

749
01:15:29,646 --> 01:15:31,136
I would have still
said the same thing.

750
01:15:31,214 --> 01:15:33,148
It's not as easy as you think...

751
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:37,277
the other agent who you killed...

752
01:15:37,354 --> 01:15:39,549
Feroz... he was also right there.

753
01:15:41,525 --> 01:15:47,361
A girl... whose training and duty
forbids her from falling in love...

754
01:15:48,231 --> 01:15:52,065
to whom could she say that yes,
she too was in love?

755
01:15:55,405 --> 01:15:58,568
To the man whose real
name she didn't know?

756
01:15:59,376 --> 01:16:01,640
To the man who was
pointing a gun at her?

757
01:16:04,548 --> 01:16:06,982
And even had I said that...
what good would it have done?

758
01:16:07,851 --> 01:16:10,479
The two of us can never be together.

759
01:16:12,789 --> 01:16:14,814
And what does it mean to be together?

760
01:16:14,891 --> 01:16:17,860
That we come and shake hands
every month at the Wagah border?

761
01:16:18,095 --> 01:16:21,724
Or send song requests for
one another on All India Radio?

762
01:16:21,798 --> 01:16:24,631
I'm ISI... you're RAW.

763
01:16:26,637 --> 01:16:28,400
We are enemies.

764
01:16:28,705 --> 01:16:31,105
Our duty won't let us be together.

765
01:16:32,309 --> 01:16:34,777
Our people won't let us be together.

766
01:16:36,346 --> 01:16:39,611
You know they'll come after us.

767
01:16:50,293 --> 01:16:51,783
Yes, Captain Abrar...

768
01:16:52,996 --> 01:16:54,520
I'm coming there...

769
01:16:55,198 --> 01:16:57,632
Yes, sure... fine.

770
01:17:28,065 --> 01:17:30,898
The sky

771
01:17:31,001 --> 01:17:33,868
Yours and mine

772
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:36,939
Like our dreams

773
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,530
Has turned to smoke

774
01:17:38,608 --> 01:17:41,372
The sky

775
01:17:41,445 --> 01:17:44,073
Yours and mine

776
01:17:44,147 --> 01:17:47,173
Like we breathe

777
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:49,150
Has turned to dust

778
01:17:49,219 --> 01:17:52,279
Wherever you go

779
01:17:52,355 --> 01:17:55,017
You will find me too

780
01:17:55,092 --> 01:17:59,461
I am now a part of you

781
01:17:59,563 --> 01:18:02,031
I am a Ionely planet

782
01:18:02,099 --> 01:18:04,624
You are a Ionely planet

783
01:18:04,701 --> 01:18:07,363
Let us come together

784
01:18:07,437 --> 01:18:09,632
Beyond the world of stars

785
01:18:09,706 --> 01:18:12,174
I am a Ionely planet

786
01:18:12,275 --> 01:18:14,835
You are a Ionely planet

787
01:18:14,945 --> 01:18:17,539
Let us come together

788
01:18:17,614 --> 01:18:20,742
Beyond the world of stars

789
01:18:20,817 --> 01:18:23,342
You caved me

790
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:25,945
You carved me

791
01:18:26,022 --> 01:18:27,819
Because of you

792
01:18:27,891 --> 01:18:30,724
I believe in me

793
01:18:30,827 --> 01:18:33,625
You are not here

794
01:18:33,697 --> 01:18:36,188
And that be true

795
01:18:36,299 --> 01:18:38,267
But if I'm here

796
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:40,803
You are here too

797
01:18:40,904 --> 01:18:43,771
Wherever you go

798
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,638
You will find me too

799
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:51,044
I am now a part of you

800
01:18:51,148 --> 01:18:53,582
I am a Ionely planet

801
01:18:53,683 --> 01:18:56,083
You are a Ionely planet

802
01:18:56,153 --> 01:18:58,587
Let us come together

803
01:18:58,688 --> 01:19:01,384
Beyond the world of stars

804
01:19:01,458 --> 01:19:03,892
I am a Ionely planet

805
01:19:03,994 --> 01:19:06,428
You are a Ionely planet

806
01:19:06,496 --> 01:19:09,090
Let us come together

807
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:12,862
Beyond the world of stars

808
01:19:45,602 --> 01:19:47,194
Hi... where have you been?

809
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:48,237
Thank you, Sir.

810
01:19:48,305 --> 01:19:49,772
You were gone all evening.

811
01:19:49,873 --> 01:19:51,465
I was following a lead, Sir.

812
01:19:51,975 --> 01:19:53,237
Relax.

813
01:21:20,730 --> 01:21:22,857
Can I please have the
pleasure of this dance?

814
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:26,128
I'm sorry but it's not
correct for me to...

815
01:21:26,503 --> 01:21:28,903
What the hell is Tiger doing?

816
01:21:29,272 --> 01:21:30,967
This is a peace conference...

817
01:21:34,711 --> 01:21:37,509
diplomats from all over the
world are dancing with each other.

818
01:21:38,548 --> 01:21:44,817
Why are Indian and Pakistani
diplomats stuck in their corners?

819
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:48,723
This is not our protocol... I'm sorry.

820
01:21:50,026 --> 01:21:51,653
If you don't mind...

821
01:21:55,799 --> 01:21:56,959
Thank you.

822
01:22:06,276 --> 01:22:08,005
What the hell do you
think you are doing?

823
01:22:17,587 --> 01:22:19,214
Zoya... you were right...

824
01:22:20,056 --> 01:22:22,388
the world will never
let us be together...

825
01:22:23,526 --> 01:22:25,551
so let's create our own world...

826
01:22:26,963 --> 01:22:28,294
let's run away, Zoya.

827
01:22:28,365 --> 01:22:31,960
You have gone mad...
don't talk nonsense.

828
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:37,535
God alone knows how long our two
countries will keep fighting...

829
01:22:38,174 --> 01:22:40,438
we cannot wait for them endlessly.

830
01:22:41,945 --> 01:22:45,745
And it might be a little
difficult to run when we're old.

831
01:22:48,184 --> 01:22:52,018
What happens to our
lives after this music ends...

832
01:22:52,922 --> 01:22:56,414
...is all in your hands, Zoya.

833
01:23:42,338 --> 01:23:43,600
Tiger...

834
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:44,898
Tiger...

835
01:23:46,242 --> 01:23:47,937
hurry up... we have
to go to the airport!

836
01:23:48,545 --> 01:23:51,776
Hello... Zoya, are you there?

837
01:23:51,881 --> 01:23:53,974
We're getting late for the airport.

838
01:23:54,084 --> 01:23:57,485
Please hurry and come down.

839
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:26,378
Sir, we can't get through to
Tiger's phone. He's out of reach...

840
01:24:26,449 --> 01:24:28,849
Sir... I think he's been
kidnapped by the Pakistanis.

841
01:24:28,918 --> 01:24:30,647
Kidnapped! Nonsense!

842
01:24:31,121 --> 01:24:32,748
He's too good for them.

843
01:24:32,856 --> 01:24:35,848
Listen... this news
should not get out.

844
01:24:35,925 --> 01:24:36,823
Okay, Sir.

845
01:24:39,262 --> 01:24:41,059
Gopi, where have you been?

846
01:24:41,131 --> 01:24:43,326
Take the next flight
from London and get here.

847
01:25:04,487 --> 01:25:06,352
Which bank has he
withdrawn the money from?

848
01:25:06,923 --> 01:25:08,083
How much?

849
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:10,888
Sir... a total of 47
thousand dollars, Sir...

850
01:25:11,561 --> 01:25:14,029
47 thousand dollars?

851
01:25:14,631 --> 01:25:16,326
Sir... about 2.3 million Rupees.

852
01:25:20,503 --> 01:25:21,936
Should be 2.3 million...

853
01:25:22,005 --> 01:25:26,704
the day I retire...
I'll blow it all up.

854
01:25:29,445 --> 01:25:31,709
Tiger has not been kidnapped!

855
01:25:48,932 --> 01:25:50,559
Do you have any idea...

856
01:25:50,667 --> 01:25:55,661
how much classified information
Tiger has about our organisation?

857
01:25:57,173 --> 01:25:59,767
If anyone gets hold
of that information...

858
01:25:59,876 --> 01:26:04,745
it will compromise the security
of our agents all over the world.

859
01:26:07,784 --> 01:26:11,914
Sir... I don't know exactly
where Tiger is or what he's up to...

860
01:26:12,956 --> 01:26:16,892
but he will never give away that kind
of information whilst he's alive...

861
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,827
I'm certain about that.

862
01:26:18,895 --> 01:26:20,089
Sir...

863
01:26:20,863 --> 01:26:21,852
we just heard that...

864
01:26:21,965 --> 01:26:23,933
a Pakistani delegate is also
missing since this morning.

865
01:26:24,567 --> 01:26:25,625
What?

866
01:26:57,934 --> 01:26:59,060
Zoya?

867
01:27:01,070 --> 01:27:03,265
This is the address of the hotel.

868
01:27:03,339 --> 01:27:04,306
Okay.

869
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:06,201
This hotel belongs to his friend.

870
01:27:06,276 --> 01:27:08,767
He'll help us book the
tickets for tomorrow.

871
01:27:10,113 --> 01:27:11,671
How long will you take?

872
01:27:11,781 --> 01:27:14,079
Might take a long... maybe
all night... you take care.

873
01:27:17,287 --> 01:27:19,312
Sir... this is Zoya.

874
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:26,656
Gopi... do you know how many
countries are there in the world?

875
01:27:27,397 --> 01:27:28,591
Sir?

876
01:27:28,665 --> 01:27:32,157
There are 201
countries in the world...

877
01:27:34,404 --> 01:27:38,238
and bloody Tiger could find
a girl only from Pakistan?

878
01:28:35,798 --> 01:28:38,062
Captain Abrar... why
have you called me here?

879
01:28:38,167 --> 01:28:40,362
Meeting like this can
derail the whole plan.

880
01:28:40,436 --> 01:28:42,233
Because I'm worried about you...

881
01:28:42,505 --> 01:28:43,995
he is an extremely dangerous agent.

882
01:28:44,073 --> 01:28:47,270
I am fine... but you will all
have to be a little more patient.

883
01:28:47,343 --> 01:28:49,573
It's not that easy to trick him.

884
01:28:49,645 --> 01:28:50,942
What you're saying is right...

885
01:28:51,047 --> 01:28:53,845
but we must know what you are
up to and where exactly are you?

886
01:28:53,916 --> 01:28:55,679
He does not suspect me at all...

887
01:28:55,752 --> 01:28:58,516
but to get him to
you here is too risky.

888
01:28:58,621 --> 01:29:01,021
I'll get him to you, but not here...

889
01:29:01,124 --> 01:29:04,252
there are too many Indians here...
Iooking for him.

890
01:29:04,894 --> 01:29:06,953
I'll bring him to the
airport in a little while.

891
01:29:07,029 --> 01:29:09,759
We'll catch the 10:30
flight to Kazakhstan.

892
01:29:10,867 --> 01:29:12,767
This is my disguise.

893
01:29:12,869 --> 01:29:15,702
He'll be with me in disguise as well.

894
01:29:15,905 --> 01:29:17,668
You can take our
picture at the airport

895
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:20,072
and send it to your
Kazakhstan station.

896
01:29:21,177 --> 01:29:23,008
After that... he's all yours.

897
01:29:26,382 --> 01:29:28,043
Take care of yourself...

898
01:29:59,782 --> 01:30:01,181
Oh, my God!

899
01:30:01,984 --> 01:30:04,919
For a second I
couldn't recognise you...

900
01:30:05,288 --> 01:30:07,119
But I clearly recognised you.

901
01:30:07,757 --> 01:30:10,624
Tickets done...
Passports done. Ready to go.

902
01:31:41,517 --> 01:31:44,714
Listen to me carefully...
there on the right...

903
01:31:44,787 --> 01:31:47,984
there's a man in a black jacket with
a red suitcase who's having coffee...

904
01:31:48,057 --> 01:31:49,422
he's an ISI agent.

905
01:31:51,227 --> 01:31:52,785
There at the luggage counter...

906
01:31:53,329 --> 01:31:54,796
the guy with the camera...

907
01:31:55,431 --> 01:31:57,592
behind him the man on the phone...

908
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:59,861
he's ISI as well.

909
01:32:01,437 --> 01:32:05,601
Come with me... our
flight has been announced.

910
01:32:06,409 --> 01:32:08,639
But our flight still
has an hour to go.

911
01:32:09,278 --> 01:32:10,905
We're not going to Kazakhstan.

912
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:12,742
Then where are we going?

913
01:32:13,115 --> 01:32:15,345
Let's see. Come quickly.

914
01:33:01,931 --> 01:33:03,364
You knew all along?

915
01:33:05,034 --> 01:33:08,197
I was an agent
before I became a lover.

916
01:33:08,437 --> 01:33:15,206
But I had to do this because of
your drama at the ballroom that day...

917
01:33:16,012 --> 01:33:17,877
Captain Abrar saw you and said...

918
01:33:17,947 --> 01:33:20,279
this prey has
happily walked to a trap.

919
01:33:21,183 --> 01:33:23,743
And right then... he
made a plan to get you.

920
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:27,812
But if you saw me
with Captain Abrar...

921
01:33:28,858 --> 01:33:30,553
then why did you come
to the airport with me?

922
01:33:30,626 --> 01:33:34,187
Zoya... all my life
I've used only my head...

923
01:33:35,264 --> 01:33:38,927
for once I followed my heart...

924
01:33:39,802 --> 01:33:44,102
I just wanted to see where
this decision would take me.

925
01:33:53,049 --> 01:33:57,315
I'm amused at the thought of
what will happen in Kazakhstan now.

926
01:34:04,827 --> 01:34:06,124
Seen anyone like her?

927
01:34:08,030 --> 01:34:10,931
See there... in that car.

928
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,527
They look like bloody Indians.

929
01:34:14,603 --> 01:34:16,969
Pakistani goons...

930
01:34:25,214 --> 01:34:26,203
Captain Abrar...

931
01:34:26,315 --> 01:34:27,111
Gopi, Sir...

932
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:31,311
Sir... it's been close to four hours
since the Istanbul flight landed...

933
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:32,682
and no one has shown up.

934
01:34:32,788 --> 01:34:33,880
Alright...

935
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:40,258
Sir... the information
about Kazakhstan was wrong.

936
01:34:41,263 --> 01:34:42,992
No one arrived there today.

937
01:34:44,934 --> 01:34:47,198
There were two other big
flights that left Istanbul yesterday.

938
01:34:47,303 --> 01:34:49,066
One to London and
the other to Frankfurt.

939
01:34:49,905 --> 01:34:53,432
Then find out from there how
many other flights departed...

940
01:34:53,542 --> 01:34:55,510
Sir... there are 623 flights at London

941
01:34:55,611 --> 01:34:57,442
and 612 flights at Frankfurt
scheduled to take off today...

942
01:34:57,546 --> 01:35:00,913
total number of passengers 825,802...

943
01:35:00,983 --> 01:35:03,042
and those two could be traveling
on a passport of any nationality...

944
01:35:03,152 --> 01:35:04,881
I don't care...

945
01:35:05,621 --> 01:35:08,886
keep searching... we
have to find them.

946
01:35:10,459 --> 01:35:11,983
Sir... my point is...

947
01:35:12,595 --> 01:35:16,087
if Tiger has decided... then it
will be very difficult to find him.

948
01:35:16,198 --> 01:35:18,223
We have created Tiger!

949
01:35:22,271 --> 01:35:24,535
RAW was functioning before him...

950
01:35:25,508 --> 01:35:28,033
and will continue even after him.

951
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:35,478
Gopi...

952
01:35:36,852 --> 01:35:40,879
the amount of information that
Tiger has about our organization...

953
01:35:41,457 --> 01:35:46,417
before ISI gets to that information...

954
01:35:46,896 --> 01:35:50,889
we have to find
Tiger and bring him back.

955
01:35:54,503 --> 01:35:56,664
And... if he doesn't want to return?

956
01:36:00,709 --> 01:36:05,976
Then I'm sure you
know what we must do...

957
01:36:08,117 --> 01:36:10,244
Just remember...

958
01:36:11,387 --> 01:36:15,983
no one should be able
to identify his body.

959
01:37:00,102 --> 01:37:02,366
Keep your eyes closed

960
01:37:02,438 --> 01:37:04,497
And count slowly

961
01:37:04,573 --> 01:37:08,304
Find me for I don't know where I am

962
01:37:08,377 --> 01:37:11,175
Forgotten are our tales

963
01:37:11,247 --> 01:37:13,442
We are strangers to our own land

964
01:37:13,549 --> 01:37:17,280
See how we have turned into thin air

965
01:37:17,519 --> 01:37:19,851
Close to the heart

966
01:37:19,922 --> 01:37:21,617
Under the sheet of dreams

967
01:37:21,690 --> 01:37:23,521
Is this lost world

968
01:37:23,592 --> 01:37:25,924
Of ours

969
01:37:26,028 --> 01:37:30,124
I am lost

970
01:37:30,232 --> 01:37:34,532
You are lost

971
01:37:34,637 --> 01:37:39,074
All our senses

972
01:37:39,141 --> 01:37:44,010
Are all lost

973
01:38:20,215 --> 01:38:24,515
Yes this is my wish

974
01:38:24,620 --> 01:38:28,488
To think of only you

975
01:38:28,958 --> 01:38:33,395
The glow that emanates from you

976
01:38:33,462 --> 01:38:37,057
Will remain captured in my dreams

977
01:38:37,166 --> 01:38:39,828
When did morning fall asleep?

978
01:38:39,935 --> 01:38:41,698
When did the stars awaken?

979
01:38:41,770 --> 01:38:43,863
We have forgotten

980
01:38:43,973 --> 01:38:46,032
what happens when

981
01:38:46,141 --> 01:38:50,305
I am lost

982
01:38:50,412 --> 01:38:54,746
You are lost

983
01:38:54,817 --> 01:38:59,117
All our senses

984
01:38:59,188 --> 01:39:03,682
Are all lost

985
01:39:40,229 --> 01:39:44,495
Yes I was breathing

986
01:39:44,566 --> 01:39:48,900
But I was never alive

987
01:39:49,138 --> 01:39:53,575
When I gave my heart away to you

988
01:39:53,642 --> 01:39:57,237
I realized what a heartbeat was

989
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:59,940
Immersed in you

990
01:40:00,049 --> 01:40:02,040
Lost in you

991
01:40:02,151 --> 01:40:03,812
Away from you

992
01:40:03,919 --> 01:40:06,114
Where do I go?

993
01:40:06,188 --> 01:40:09,988
I am lost

994
01:40:10,526 --> 01:40:14,656
You are lost

995
01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:19,023
All our senses

996
01:40:19,401 --> 01:40:24,634
Are all lost

997
01:40:40,556 --> 01:40:41,853
What does it mean?

998
01:40:44,293 --> 01:40:46,557
Sane love...

999
01:40:46,995 --> 01:40:48,690
is no love.

1000
01:40:50,799 --> 01:40:52,130
Wow!

1001
01:41:31,874 --> 01:41:33,865
Give me your money!

1002
01:41:35,144 --> 01:41:36,805
Give me your money!

1003
01:41:39,681 --> 01:41:42,707
Give me your money!

1004
01:42:34,703 --> 01:42:37,695
Zoya... let's get out of here.

1005
01:42:41,343 --> 01:42:44,369
Zoya... let's get out of here.

1006
01:42:44,446 --> 01:42:46,243
What language is it?

1007
01:42:46,615 --> 01:42:48,173
Is it Arabic?

1008
01:42:48,283 --> 01:42:52,310
No, not Arabic... sounds like...
Hindi or Bengali...

1009
01:42:52,387 --> 01:42:57,086
Spoken in India... Pakistan...

1010
01:42:57,926 --> 01:43:01,487
Bangladesh... Afghanistan...

1011
01:43:05,634 --> 01:43:09,092
Dayal... Why have you sent me this?

1012
01:43:09,204 --> 01:43:12,935
Don't send me Embassy correspondence.

1013
01:43:13,375 --> 01:43:17,175
You should be able to
handle this at your level.

1014
01:43:17,379 --> 01:43:20,041
My brains get fried
with all this nonsense...

1015
01:43:20,148 --> 01:43:22,639
and especially when
I'm ready to go home...

1016
01:43:42,037 --> 01:43:43,902
Which embassy?

1017
01:43:43,972 --> 01:43:46,440
Havana, Sir... Cuba.

1018
01:43:55,384 --> 01:43:58,182
Honeymoon's over... Tiger.

1019
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:24,907
We're being watched.

1020
01:44:29,051 --> 01:44:30,313
Eleven o' clock.

1021
01:44:33,422 --> 01:44:36,448
You are right... we are being watched.

1022
01:45:10,959 --> 01:45:13,723
Can you please come
back in 20 minutes?

1023
01:45:14,396 --> 01:45:15,385
Yes, Zoya?

1024
01:45:15,497 --> 01:45:17,192
They are saying that they
need the manager's authorisation

1025
01:45:17,299 --> 01:45:20,097
for such a big amount...
and he's not there...

1026
01:45:20,535 --> 01:45:22,503
right now they can only
give half of that amount.

1027
01:45:22,604 --> 01:45:23,832
Okay... get that for now.

1028
01:45:38,487 --> 01:45:41,251
The manager will be back in 20
minutes... this is all I could get.

1029
01:45:41,356 --> 01:45:43,256
I will get a car with the money...

1030
01:45:43,325 --> 01:45:45,793
you withdraw the rest of
the money from the bank...

1031
01:45:45,894 --> 01:45:48,658
don't worry... we'll be
out of here by evening.

1032
01:46:02,677 --> 01:46:04,804
Police please?

1033
01:46:18,226 --> 01:46:21,320
Stop now... you've run enough.

1034
01:46:32,874 --> 01:46:35,240
Zoya... look what I found...

1035
01:46:35,844 --> 01:46:38,039
Willy's jeep... the same '52 model.

1036
01:46:40,949 --> 01:46:45,079
Oh... I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to remind you of your father.

1037
01:46:50,725 --> 01:46:51,987
What happened?

1038
01:46:52,694 --> 01:46:53,991
It's over...

1039
01:46:57,566 --> 01:46:59,557
They were waiting for you...

1040
01:46:59,768 --> 01:47:01,895
we have to go and sit in that car.

1041
01:47:29,164 --> 01:47:30,961
Tiger, don't try anything here...

1042
01:47:31,433 --> 01:47:35,767
I know... they will kill
us here if they have to.

1043
01:47:41,443 --> 01:47:42,705
Come...

1044
01:48:09,604 --> 01:48:10,901
No!

1045
01:48:20,615 --> 01:48:22,674
Follow them... fast!

1046
01:48:23,018 --> 01:48:24,747
Hurry up!

1047
01:49:12,801 --> 01:49:14,098
Come on.

1048
01:49:17,505 --> 01:49:19,234
Hey, stop.

1049
01:49:19,341 --> 01:49:21,002
Wait... wait.

1050
01:49:25,614 --> 01:49:26,876
Thank you.

1051
01:50:37,552 --> 01:50:39,577
Tiger... Tiger, come on! Fast!

1052
01:51:15,790 --> 01:51:17,223
Stop it, Zoya!

1053
01:51:19,961 --> 01:51:21,292
Enough!

1054
01:54:59,881 --> 01:55:02,372
What is it that they
have and we don't?

1055
01:55:02,483 --> 01:55:04,075
Five minutes are more than enough...

1056
01:55:04,152 --> 01:55:06,416
I don't care... If you have
to shoot him... then do it

1057
01:55:12,026 --> 01:55:13,357
I'll call you back.

1058
01:55:13,461 --> 01:55:16,362
So, Gopi... you want me to be shot?

1059
01:55:16,431 --> 01:55:17,921
You deserve to be shot.

1060
01:55:17,999 --> 01:55:20,524
What have I done?
- What have you done?

1061
01:55:22,236 --> 01:55:25,137
Tiger, do you know how many
countries there are in the world?

1062
01:55:25,206 --> 01:55:28,801
201 countries... there are
201 countries and you...

1063
01:55:28,910 --> 01:55:34,075
203... after Kosovo
separated from Serbia.

1064
01:55:34,749 --> 01:55:35,977
Okay...

1065
01:55:36,351 --> 01:55:38,512
203 countries and you...

1066
01:55:38,619 --> 01:55:41,144
No... 204...

1067
01:55:41,556 --> 01:55:43,649
because Montenegro also
separated from Serbia.

1068
01:55:43,758 --> 01:55:46,318
I don't care whether there
are 203 or 204 countries!

1069
01:55:46,427 --> 01:55:49,089
How can you elope with a Pakistani?

1070
01:55:49,564 --> 01:55:55,025
Gopi... do you know how much
information Zoya can provide us?

1071
01:55:55,403 --> 01:55:57,303
Do you have any idea?

1072
01:55:57,438 --> 01:56:00,305
Zoya is ready to
come to India with us.

1073
01:56:01,409 --> 01:56:02,740
Really?

1074
01:56:04,712 --> 01:56:05,872
Then where is she?

1075
01:56:05,947 --> 01:56:07,346
Call her... let's leave.

1076
01:56:08,950 --> 01:56:14,013
For that I'll need you and your boys.

1077
01:56:14,088 --> 01:56:16,352
Why? You just told
me that she's ready.

1078
01:56:16,491 --> 01:56:18,823
Yes but those people
who she is with right now

1079
01:56:18,893 --> 01:56:21,726
won't let her come
to India that easily.

1080
01:56:22,430 --> 01:56:23,863
Who are they?

1081
01:56:24,132 --> 01:56:25,497
Our friends...

1082
01:56:29,203 --> 01:56:30,898
So let me get this straight...

1083
01:56:31,406 --> 01:56:35,775
you want us to
attack the ISI in Cuba...

1084
01:56:35,877 --> 01:56:39,506
why... to kidnap a girl?

1085
01:56:40,314 --> 01:56:41,645
Girl?

1086
01:56:42,583 --> 01:56:44,881
The same girl was your
sister-in-law in Dublin...

1087
01:56:44,952 --> 01:56:47,147
when you found out
she was a Pakistani...

1088
01:56:47,822 --> 01:56:50,052
you demoted her from
sister-in-law to just a girl?

1089
01:56:52,827 --> 01:56:56,661
Gopi... they are flying her to
Pakistan tomorrow morning...

1090
01:56:57,532 --> 01:56:58,965
Hey caveman...

1091
01:56:59,033 --> 01:57:01,558
whatever needs to be done,
should be done now.

1092
01:57:05,373 --> 01:57:07,238
What will Shenoy Sir say?

1093
01:57:09,444 --> 01:57:13,608
Tiger... Tiger... Tiger...

1094
01:57:13,948 --> 01:57:15,677
What the hell is Tiger doing?

1095
01:57:22,290 --> 01:57:25,589
That's the plan...
Tokas, you will be here.

1096
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:27,560
Sir...
- Bablu... you'll be at this point...

1097
01:57:27,628 --> 01:57:30,256
Ok, Sir - Jassi, you
will block them from here.

1098
01:57:30,364 --> 01:57:32,457
Tiger... take this.
- Thanks, Gopi...

1099
01:57:33,134 --> 01:57:39,130
You, caveman... you got an
entire army just to catch me?

1100
01:57:39,207 --> 01:57:41,232
Sir... don't forget we
came here to catch that man

1101
01:57:41,309 --> 01:57:42,640
from whom we learnt everything.

1102
01:57:42,743 --> 01:57:46,577
One last time... you'll be here.
- Yes, sir.

1103
01:57:46,681 --> 01:57:48,581
Tomorrow morning sharp at eight.

1104
01:58:04,031 --> 01:58:06,659
Our flight will take
off in two hours...

1105
01:58:07,301 --> 01:58:10,566
don't try anything
strange at the airport.

1106
01:58:15,443 --> 01:58:17,877
Nothing is more precious
in the world for a woman...

1107
01:58:17,979 --> 01:58:20,447
than her honour and dignity.

1108
01:58:27,622 --> 01:58:30,887
And that Indian friend of yours...

1109
01:58:31,692 --> 01:58:33,922
he left you alone and
disappeared really fast?

1110
01:58:45,306 --> 01:58:47,001
Come on, come on!

1111
01:59:11,732 --> 01:59:13,632
Come on, come on! Go, go!

1112
01:59:44,799 --> 01:59:46,994
Hurry! Follow them, quick!

1113
01:59:53,741 --> 01:59:57,040
You rascal... God made
you and broke that mould!

1114
01:59:57,612 --> 01:59:58,943
Sister-in-law!

1115
02:00:12,126 --> 02:00:14,026
Turn around! Now!

1116
02:00:23,938 --> 02:00:25,405
Turn left!

1117
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:48,946
Come on, go go! Airpark!

1118
02:01:49,023 --> 02:01:50,615
Come on! Move fast!

1119
02:02:14,081 --> 02:02:16,072
Stop! Stop there!

1120
02:02:28,996 --> 02:02:30,691
I will make it...
don't worry about me...

1121
02:02:30,765 --> 02:02:32,756
don't stop the plane for anything...

1122
02:02:32,833 --> 02:02:35,097
we'll get just this
one chance for take off!

1123
02:03:13,007 --> 02:03:14,269
Go, go, go!

1124
02:03:14,341 --> 02:03:15,774
Cut them off!

1125
02:05:14,061 --> 02:05:17,827
Hey, pilot... fly me to a safe place.

1126
02:05:37,618 --> 02:05:38,880
Hello...

1127
02:05:39,219 --> 02:05:40,709
Hello?

1128
02:05:40,788 --> 02:05:42,380
Shenoy Sir...

1129
02:05:51,265 --> 02:05:53,756
Speak up... Avinash Singh Rathore.

1130
02:05:53,867 --> 02:05:58,668
You've called me by my real
name for the very first time...

1131
02:05:58,772 --> 02:06:01,502
You've shown your true
colours for the first time...

1132
02:06:01,575 --> 02:06:06,012
No, Sir... for the first time in
my life I truly followed my heart.

1133
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:08,981
You forgot your duty.

1134
02:06:09,283 --> 02:06:11,478
No, Sir... I never forget my duty...

1135
02:06:11,552 --> 02:06:13,816
I remember my duty... my training...

1136
02:06:13,921 --> 02:06:18,255
but I also understand that beyond
them Tiger is a human being too...

1137
02:06:18,459 --> 02:06:22,828
You yourself said once...
it's not easy to live with regrets.

1138
02:06:23,364 --> 02:06:26,856
To love your enemy is treachery...

1139
02:06:27,901 --> 02:06:31,735
Sir... when I was falling in love...
no one told me she was the enemy...

1140
02:06:31,839 --> 02:06:37,141
and when I fell in love... I couldn't
understand why she was the enemy.

1141
02:06:40,047 --> 02:06:41,844
Tiger...
- Sir...

1142
02:06:41,915 --> 02:06:43,439
How long will you keep running away?

1143
02:06:43,517 --> 02:06:49,114
Sir... the day India and
Pakistan don't need RAW and ISI...

1144
02:06:49,923 --> 02:06:51,550
that day we will come back.

1145
02:06:57,064 --> 02:06:58,395
Good luck.

1146
02:07:02,302 --> 02:07:03,792
Shenoy Sir

1147
02:07:19,887 --> 02:07:24,017
Agent Tiger and Agent Zoya
have been listed as 'missing'...

1148
02:07:24,124 --> 02:07:26,456
in the files of RAW and ISI.

1149
02:07:27,294 --> 02:07:29,592
But reports of them being seen...

1150
02:07:29,730 --> 02:07:32,824
have been reported
from all over the world.

1151
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:38,133
However, it's impossible to say if
they were actually Tiger and Zoya.

1152
02:07:39,206 --> 02:07:44,234
RAW and ISI have been
searching for them all over the world.

1153
02:07:45,879 --> 02:07:47,574
For the first time in their history...

1154
02:07:47,648 --> 02:07:51,015
these rival agencies have
worked together on a mission.

1155
02:07:53,587 --> 02:07:56,420
Whichever corner of the world
Tiger and Zoya might be in...

1156
02:07:56,523 --> 02:07:59,549
they must be smiling
upon hearing this news.
