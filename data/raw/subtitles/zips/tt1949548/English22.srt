00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:08,561
B******!

3
00:02:38,764 --> 00:02:40,994
Madam, no smoking in here.

4
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:42,456
Mahi Arora!

5
00:02:43,368 --> 00:02:44,528
Come sit...

6
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:46,430
Madam...

7
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:50,397
Shinde, throw away her cigarette.

8
00:02:51,844 --> 00:02:52,469
Yes, madam?

9
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:53,574
Do you want to
lodge a complaint?

10
00:02:54,813 --> 00:02:56,337
Against whom?

11
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,715
Did you get into a fight?

12
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:00,943
Should l call for
a lady constable?

13
00:03:03,388 --> 00:03:04,514
Did some one assault you?

14
00:03:05,357 --> 00:03:07,689
lf you don't talk to me,
l am helpless.

15
00:03:10,395 --> 00:03:11,919
Your phone is ringing.

16
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:13,362
At least answer your phone.

17
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:15,596
lf you don't talk,
how will we know what's wrong.

18
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,394
Please say something.

19
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:20,660
What's the problem?

20
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:21,535
Mahi... let's go.

21
00:03:22,341 --> 00:03:23,968
- Come on, let's go!
- She wants to lodge a complaint.

22
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:25,537
Sorry, sir. There's no complaint.

23
00:03:25,711 --> 00:03:26,507
Who are you?

24
00:03:26,712 --> 00:03:27,770
l am her secretary.

25
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:29,871
Let's go.
Get up!

26
00:03:29,982 --> 00:03:30,971
Mahi, get up.

27
00:03:33,018 --> 00:03:34,747
Let's go.
Come on.

28
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,751
This way... good.

29
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,320
You shouldn't have
come to the police station.

30
00:03:42,594 --> 00:03:45,028
Mahi, against whom do you
want to lodge a complaint?

31
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:52,493
Move away!

32
00:03:54,606 --> 00:03:56,073
Allow us to go!

33
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:59,504
Mahi... Are you getting married
to Aryan Khanna?

34
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:05,541
What is your relationship
with Aryan Khanna?

35
00:04:07,619 --> 00:04:09,985
Mahi, did you know that
lsha was attending the same party?

36
00:04:12,391 --> 00:04:16,691
Mahi...

37
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:30,733
Out.

38
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:32,504
- l am ready.
- Action.

39
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:37,410
Mahi Arora.

40
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:39,608
What can l say about her...

41
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,508
Unpredictable.

42
00:04:42,054 --> 00:04:44,420
But journalists like me have to use
adjectives for them.

43
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,924
So there were a few...

44
00:04:47,326 --> 00:04:50,762
lmpulsive, vulnerable, drama queen.

45
00:04:51,997 --> 00:04:53,862
Mahi Arora was a star...

46
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:56,893
but she was different
from the other actresses.

47
00:04:56,969 --> 00:04:58,960
She was fabulous at interviews.

48
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:01,665
Her words,
they always struck a chord somewhere.

49
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:03,935
She was bit of a rebel.

50
00:05:04,876 --> 00:05:06,002
And why not?

51
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:09,245
A broken family,
parents fighting everyday...

52
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:10,372
disturbed childhood...

53
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:11,772
And then?

54
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:14,476
Mahi got a reason to be wild.

55
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,248
And she fled her home to Mumbai.

56
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:18,949
lt's a well known fact
that the film industry...

57
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:21,952
adores complicated stories.

58
00:05:22,628 --> 00:05:23,890
Thus, Mahi Arora became...

59
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:25,562
The star!

60
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:45,633
Good morning, Rashid bhai.

61
00:07:45,704 --> 00:07:48,832
- Hi!
- Hi!

62
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:51,375
Happy?

63
00:07:51,777 --> 00:07:54,302
- You are looking lovely.
- Yes!

64
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,312
- So, how's it going?
- All well.

65
00:07:57,983 --> 00:07:58,779
Rashid bhai...

66
00:07:59,351 --> 00:08:00,648
cancel all appointments for today.

67
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:02,311
But why, Mahi?

68
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:04,547
Well, l want to rest all day.

69
00:08:04,756 --> 00:08:06,621
So l look fabulous
at the success party.

70
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:08,726
Alright.

71
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,587
- What do you think guys?
- Superb!

72
00:08:10,662 --> 00:08:11,686
Like you always do.

73
00:08:11,763 --> 00:08:12,491
By the way guys...

74
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:14,790
did you see Gayatri Reddy
at the premiere party?

75
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:15,695
My God!

76
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:17,758
She was bitching about you
to Rhea Mehra.

77
00:08:17,836 --> 00:08:18,768
Really?

78
00:08:18,937 --> 00:08:21,599
Can't these actresses
ever be happy for their peers?

79
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:23,975
Mahi, you must watch out, okay?

80
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,002
Please, Andy!

81
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:27,768
When have l ever
competed with them?

82
00:08:27,946 --> 00:08:29,470
l just want to have fun.

83
00:08:29,548 --> 00:08:30,640
Also, the film is a hit.

84
00:08:30,715 --> 00:08:32,239
And, l've got some
good titles ahead.

85
00:08:32,517 --> 00:08:33,575
So, who cares about
what they say?

86
00:08:33,652 --> 00:08:34,949
l completely agree.

87
00:08:36,354 --> 00:08:37,321
Gracy...

88
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:39,417
my cigarettes.

89
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:41,354
Anyway...

90
00:08:41,426 --> 00:08:42,654
l've brought
some outfits along.

91
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:43,955
Please try them on, babes.

92
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:46,964
Let's decide what you will wear
to the party tonight.

93
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:48,425
No, l don't want to.

94
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,831
Choose any you like.
l will just wear that.

95
00:08:50,035 --> 00:08:51,593
Okay then.
Red?

96
00:08:51,736 --> 00:08:52,794
Red.

97
00:08:53,505 --> 00:08:56,736
By the way,
Aryan is also attending the party.

98
00:08:56,942 --> 00:08:57,772
Oh come on!

99
00:08:57,943 --> 00:09:00,503
Has he ever attended
any of you functions?

100
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:02,376
He won't attend
like always.

101
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:04,842
Rats, come on, be positive.

102
00:09:05,217 --> 00:09:07,651
lt's possible that
tonight he might attend.

103
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:09,480
God knows!

104
00:09:17,362 --> 00:09:18,522
Sameer!

105
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,420
Sameer, l love you.

106
00:09:25,403 --> 00:09:27,234
l love you Rhea!

107
00:09:31,243 --> 00:09:32,710
Love you Danish!

108
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:37,747
Abbas Khan!

109
00:09:42,754 --> 00:09:44,722
Hey Gayatri!

110
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:46,757
l love you Gayatri!

111
00:10:02,908 --> 00:10:04,967
Angad, its said that,
soon you'll be promoted...

112
00:10:05,043 --> 00:10:07,477
from Vice-captain to Captain
of the lndian Cricket team.

113
00:10:07,646 --> 00:10:10,410
Well, this is a film party and...

114
00:10:10,482 --> 00:10:13,508
l'd appreciate if you would not
talk about cricket now.

115
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:16,987
Gayatri, everyone's talking about
the rivalry between Mahi and you.

116
00:10:17,022 --> 00:10:18,455
Would you like to
comment on that?

117
00:10:18,523 --> 00:10:21,321
Mahi and l are just acquaintances,
there's no rivalry.

118
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,725
And l'm really happy that
Sameer and Mahi's film is a hit.

119
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:24,887
That is why l'm here.

120
00:10:33,872 --> 00:10:36,932
Well, Abbas you...
you've been such a rare sight.

121
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:38,703
l am really surprised
to see you here.

122
00:10:39,611 --> 00:10:40,942
l'm here to give my
best wishes to Sameer.

123
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:42,937
l heard you are
writing your biography.

124
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:43,938
Vibha!

125
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,350
Why do l have to write
my own biography?

126
00:10:47,585 --> 00:10:51,578
There are plenty of ex-editors
from various publications.

127
00:10:51,656 --> 00:10:52,486
Someone will do the honors.

128
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:54,954
That's so typical
Abbas Khan, you know!

129
00:10:55,827 --> 00:10:57,590
- Hey Rhea!
- Congratulations.

130
00:10:58,763 --> 00:11:00,663
You deserved it completely.

131
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:01,695
Yeah!

132
00:11:01,766 --> 00:11:04,701
l told you that the
film will be a super hit.

133
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,268
Thank you.

134
00:11:06,604 --> 00:11:09,630
- Your new film, Custody, is out, isn't it?
- Yes.

135
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,369
Everyone's been talking about
your performance.

136
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:13,809
But, you know, l've been so busy,
haven't had the time to watch it.

137
00:11:13,878 --> 00:11:16,278
Oh! l'll have
a screening for you.

138
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:18,914
They're bonding
as if they were sisters.

139
00:11:19,718 --> 00:11:20,582
Such hypocrites.

140
00:11:20,652 --> 00:11:22,347
Meet Kalpana,
SM Channel head.

141
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:22,909
Hello.

142
00:11:22,988 --> 00:11:25,513
This is Mukesh Tyagi.
He is a big project designer.

143
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,623
Meet Shaheen Khan,
she's an upcoming actress.

144
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,020
Her debut film 'Mumbai Love'
was out recently.

145
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:33,628
Wow! That's great.

146
00:11:33,898 --> 00:11:35,365
She's also doing
two regional films.

147
00:12:06,297 --> 00:12:08,527
He didn't make it.
l told you, right?

148
00:12:10,702 --> 00:12:11,464
Get me a drink.

149
00:12:12,837 --> 00:12:13,599
Mahi...

150
00:12:14,305 --> 00:12:16,705
- Get me a drink, now!
- Okay.

151
00:12:23,515 --> 00:12:24,038
Action!

152
00:12:33,391 --> 00:12:33,755
Cut!

153
00:12:35,026 --> 00:12:35,754
Number taken
clap out.

154
00:12:39,898 --> 00:12:42,025
And 5... 6...
7... 8.

155
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:44,468
Cut... cut it.

156
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:44,964
Cut it.

157
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,633
Mahi, it's simply not happening.

158
00:12:49,074 --> 00:12:51,065
We'll shoot after the break.
Break for lunch.

159
00:12:51,943 --> 00:12:53,968
Mahi, you need to focus.

160
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:57,378
lf you need more reharsals,
then just do it.

161
00:12:57,449 --> 00:12:58,040
Fine!

162
00:12:58,316 --> 00:12:59,613
Please give her
some easy steps...

163
00:12:59,684 --> 00:13:01,242
So many retakes...

164
00:13:10,595 --> 00:13:11,493
Tablet.

165
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,316
l'm sorry, babes.

166
00:13:36,621 --> 00:13:38,282
That jerk off, Sameer Khan.

167
00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:41,883
l don't watch his films,
so how could l come for his party?

168
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:46,758
Well, the party was
for my success too.

169
00:13:47,532 --> 00:13:49,295
And you told me
you would attend.

170
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:51,463
l couldn't say no
when you asked me.

171
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:53,926
l didn't want to hurt you.

172
00:13:54,973 --> 00:13:56,531
You did the same by
not attending.

173
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,477
Rats told me that
you wouldn't come.

174
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:02,637
Come on, Mahi.
That psycho b****!

175
00:14:03,615 --> 00:14:05,606
Why are you taking her seriously?

176
00:14:05,884 --> 00:14:07,476
Because you
don't take me seriously!

177
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:11,714
That's nonsense, Mahi!

178
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:12,813
lt's true.

179
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:15,382
lf you took me seriously,
l'd know.

180
00:14:19,764 --> 00:14:22,927
Babes! l am sorry, okay?

181
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:24,901
l f***** up! l am sorry.

182
00:14:27,338 --> 00:14:28,771
Please babes, come on...

183
00:14:29,707 --> 00:14:30,799
You know what...

184
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:33,673
l'm coming to your place,
after the pack-up.

185
00:14:33,745 --> 00:14:35,007
l will make up for everything.

186
00:15:30,802 --> 00:15:31,700
Aryan...

187
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:36,634
l've sent my passport
to your office.

188
00:15:36,874 --> 00:15:39,001
The visa for the Bahamas
takes about 15 days.

189
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:41,372
For God sake, Mahi!

190
00:15:41,546 --> 00:15:42,740
The Bahamas trip is three months away!

191
00:15:43,514 --> 00:15:44,845
So what?

192
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:47,040
l am so excited.

193
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:50,012
This holiday is very
important for me.

194
00:15:50,355 --> 00:15:51,947
We've never been on
a holiday together.

195
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:57,585
ls that my phone?

196
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,956
Where is it?

197
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:08,435
Perfect timing!

198
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:12,637
Yeah!

199
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:18,375
Really?
l'll be there in 20 minutes.

200
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,009
Yeah.

201
00:16:20,852 --> 00:16:21,716
Damn!

202
00:16:21,953 --> 00:16:23,818
Akshat isn't feeling well.

203
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:24,752
l've got to go home.

204
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:28,816
l am sorry babes.

205
00:16:36,301 --> 00:16:37,268
Hey.

206
00:16:37,802 --> 00:16:39,429
What's wrong with my Spiderman?

207
00:16:40,972 --> 00:16:41,700
How're you feeling?

208
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:47,576
Since when does he
have a fever?

209
00:16:47,812 --> 00:16:48,836
As soon as he got back from school.

210
00:16:49,314 --> 00:16:52,579
He was feeling weak,
so l called the doctor.

211
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,315
Go to sleep.

212
00:16:57,388 --> 00:16:58,616
You will be okay.

213
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,691
l love you.

214
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:10,859
Sorry, Aryan.

215
00:17:11,502 --> 00:17:12,764
Akshat insisted to see you...

216
00:17:12,837 --> 00:17:13,895
that's why l asked you to come over.

217
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:19,401
Were you at your place or at Mahi's?

218
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:23,573
How does it matter?

219
00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:26,376
l see...

220
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:28,248
By the way, the lawyer called.

221
00:17:28,753 --> 00:17:31,415
He said the divorce documents are ready and
l should sign them.

222
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,384
- So do it!
- l will.

223
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,018
But, l want to ask you something.

224
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:40,625
What have you thought about the
Bandstand apartment?

225
00:17:40,932 --> 00:17:41,990
What's there to think?

226
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,691
l've told you before that
l am keeping it.

227
00:17:45,336 --> 00:17:47,327
l've given you this apartment
as well as two more in Goa.

228
00:17:47,638 --> 00:17:49,299
But l don't want it for me.

229
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,505
l want it for your son.

230
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,301
His school is nearby the place.

231
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:55,876
lsha...

232
00:17:55,947 --> 00:17:58,848
you know l bought that apartment
for my parents.

233
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,783
You can move them
to your place in Malad.

234
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,522
This is unbelievable!

235
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,751
You know, l just can't believe this!

236
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,627
Three properties... 100 million settlement...
and you still want more!

237
00:18:13,264 --> 00:18:14,526
l didn't expect this from you...

238
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,430
l too had a lot of expectations...

239
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:18,360
let's not go there.

240
00:18:18,436 --> 00:18:19,926
lt's better you take a decision
about the apartment...

241
00:18:20,004 --> 00:18:21,972
so l can sign the documents,
okay?

242
00:18:28,646 --> 00:18:29,510
You are too much, lsha!

243
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,944
Thanks so much, Rhea,
for this exclusive interview. Really!

244
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:36,384
Anything for you, Tamanna!

245
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:37,945
You're coming with me
to Spain, okay?

246
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:41,322
l would love to. Thanks again.
Okay, bye baby, see you.

247
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:42,518
Yeah, Nisha?

248
00:18:43,594 --> 00:18:45,994
What?
Really?

249
00:18:46,264 --> 00:18:46,855
Shit!

250
00:18:46,931 --> 00:18:49,422
l was certain it would happen.

251
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,593
No chance at all?

252
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:52,636
Sure?

253
00:18:53,971 --> 00:18:55,700
Okay, l'll call you later.

254
00:18:55,773 --> 00:18:57,400
Hey babes!

255
00:18:57,475 --> 00:18:59,739
- Babes...
- Hi!

256
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,574
Babes, what happened?

257
00:19:07,652 --> 00:19:09,586
You seem tense, what's wrong?

258
00:19:10,955 --> 00:19:12,786
Do you know the owner
of Panache Diamonds?

259
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,259
- Yes, that dude, Jay Sanghvi, right?
- Yes.

260
00:19:15,326 --> 00:19:15,815
What about Panache?

261
00:19:16,828 --> 00:19:19,626
Their endorsement deal was
up for renewal.

262
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:22,493
- My team has been trying for the past two years.
- Okay...

263
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:24,728
But even this year,
they are continuing with Mahi.

264
00:19:24,802 --> 00:19:25,962
lt's fine.

265
00:19:26,938 --> 00:19:28,599
lt's not fine!

266
00:19:28,673 --> 00:19:31,471
lf l get this deal...
it will be a clincher.

267
00:19:31,976 --> 00:19:32,704
What now?.

268
00:19:35,646 --> 00:19:36,670
You know...

269
00:19:36,747 --> 00:19:38,942
Jay Sanghvi... he is bisexual.

270
00:19:40,585 --> 00:19:41,609
And, he has the hots for you.

271
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:47,383
Listen...
l really need this.

272
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,426
Dude, not a word outside.

273
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,559
Bro... l know.

274
00:19:57,635 --> 00:20:01,833
ln this industry,
both zippers and lips should be opened carefully.

275
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,370
Say hi to Rhea.

276
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:04,635
Okay, bro.

277
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:13,610
Mahi...

278
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:16,847
Rhea has won
the Panache Diamond endorsement deal.

279
00:20:17,588 --> 00:20:18,316
lt's okay.

280
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,755
l can't endorse everything, can l?

281
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,552
You take everything very lightly.

282
00:20:25,663 --> 00:20:26,459
Yes, mom.

283
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:27,827
l will see you soon.

284
00:20:34,605 --> 00:20:36,903
- Are you going to Noida?
- Yes.

285
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:38,498
- Are you going for the dinner?
- Yes.

286
00:20:38,576 --> 00:20:38,974
Hi mom.

287
00:20:40,845 --> 00:20:41,869
Hi Mahi.

288
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:48,449
Hello Mahi, congrats.
l heard your film is a hit.

289
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,042
Yes!

290
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:51,045
When is the next release?

291
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,482
l don't know.

292
00:20:53,691 --> 00:20:55,659
You can read about it in the papers.

293
00:20:57,795 --> 00:20:58,489
Oh yes!

294
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:02,559
l've recommended you for the
Padamshree award.

295
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:03,529
Really?

296
00:21:04,402 --> 00:21:05,733
Thanks.

297
00:21:09,707 --> 00:21:10,401
Come...

298
00:21:16,847 --> 00:21:19,543
You came to Delhi three times
last month.

299
00:21:19,617 --> 00:21:20,914
Yet you didn't come here.

300
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,812
Well, if l had,
l would've had to meet your 'special' cabinet minister.

301
00:21:26,924 --> 00:21:27,856
And, you know l don't like him.

302
00:21:28,526 --> 00:21:30,687
What about your 'special' co-star?

303
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:31,693
The last time you were here...

304
00:21:31,762 --> 00:21:34,390
you had said his divorce would
be finalized in six months.

305
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,066
lt's been eight months since then.

306
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:37,399
Did you talk to him?

307
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:38,591
Did he say anything?

308
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:41,067
- ls he marrying you or not?
- Mom, stop it!

309
00:21:42,373 --> 00:21:43,533
All those questions!

310
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,901
Have l ever asked you
about your relationships?

311
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:47,772
Because you aren't my mother!

312
00:21:48,613 --> 00:21:49,011
Look Mahi...

313
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,675
l know you are quite insecure
about this relationship.

314
00:21:52,883 --> 00:21:56,444
And, one day this insecurity
will develop into an obsession.

315
00:21:56,687 --> 00:21:59,315
lt could backfire and...

316
00:21:59,557 --> 00:22:01,491
you'll be left with
neither relationship nor career.

317
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,791
l think you are confused, mom.

318
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:07,259
You are talking about yourself,
not about me.

319
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:10,491
l am very different from you.

320
00:22:10,735 --> 00:22:11,963
My life is fully under control.

321
00:22:12,403 --> 00:22:13,631
l am sure it is.

322
00:22:13,838 --> 00:22:14,862
But do you know...

323
00:22:15,306 --> 00:22:17,638
you had said the same about
your previous relationships?

324
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:18,900
Do you remember?

325
00:22:27,551 --> 00:22:29,781
We'll complete the dubbing in the evening.

326
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:32,912
Next week you have two events.

327
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:35,292
A spa opening in Hyderabad and...

328
00:22:35,526 --> 00:22:37,426
ajewelry exhibition in Jaipur.

329
00:22:38,562 --> 00:22:40,826
Take care, Mahesh!

330
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:44,567
- Hi Tamanna.
- Hi Mahi.

331
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:46,730
You were here to interview my director?

332
00:22:47,304 --> 00:22:47,929
Yes.

333
00:22:48,406 --> 00:22:50,670
Ever since you joined Mumbai Daily,
you haven't called me.

334
00:22:51,475 --> 00:22:52,305
Come on, Mahi.

335
00:22:52,376 --> 00:22:54,867
lt's not that.
l was busy, that's all.

336
00:22:54,945 --> 00:22:56,503
Busy?

337
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,569
With Rhea Mehra, right?

338
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:00,941
You've put her on the cover page
twice in one week!

339
00:23:01,018 --> 00:23:02,918
ln fact, she does a lot for you.

340
00:23:02,987 --> 00:23:04,648
Free vacations for your family...

341
00:23:04,955 --> 00:23:07,549
new laptop for you... shopping in Dubai...

342
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,252
She is such a nice person!

343
00:23:11,629 --> 00:23:13,358
That's absolute nonsense, Mahi.

344
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:15,026
Rhea is a close friend.

345
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:17,933
ln fact, l've known her even
before she became a star.

346
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:19,393
How sweet!

347
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,732
That's why you publish
all the negative things...

348
00:23:20,771 --> 00:23:22,363
she has to say about me.

349
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:22,963
Mahi!

350
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:24,864
Wake up, Tamanna.

351
00:23:25,743 --> 00:23:28,610
You are the associate editor
of Mumbai Daily.

352
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,706
Film stars aren't your friends.
They are friends with your position.

353
00:23:33,784 --> 00:23:34,716
By the way...

354
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:36,719
speaking of positions...

355
00:23:36,787 --> 00:23:39,381
l'm having dinner with
your group editor tonight.

356
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:41,417
l'm sure we'll talk about you.

357
00:23:45,996 --> 00:23:46,690
B****!

358
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:53,764
Rats, where are you
Weren't you coming here?

359
00:23:53,938 --> 00:23:55,906
What?

360
00:23:56,073 --> 00:23:58,507
Are you serious?

361
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:03,439
Rashid bhai, pack-up for today.

362
00:24:03,514 --> 00:24:04,412
Today is the last day, Mahi.

363
00:24:04,482 --> 00:24:05,779
The dates are locked.

364
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,977
Tell them l got food poisoning.

365
00:24:17,895 --> 00:24:19,328
That's it, Aryan.

366
00:24:19,396 --> 00:24:20,624
Hold her close...

367
00:24:20,664 --> 00:24:21,528
more passion Aryan...

368
00:24:22,366 --> 00:24:23,924
feel it...
hold her close...

369
00:24:24,802 --> 00:24:26,292
Gayatri, look into his eyes.

370
00:24:27,371 --> 00:24:27,860
Yes!

371
00:24:27,938 --> 00:24:28,996
That's good!

372
00:24:29,607 --> 00:24:30,733
Aryan, bring in more passion...
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

373
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:32,703
more passion.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

374
00:24:34,645 --> 00:24:35,475
Cut it! Cut it!
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

375
00:24:37,414 --> 00:24:38,472
Hello Mahi...
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

376
00:24:43,788 --> 00:24:44,914
- Arup...
- Yes, ma'am?

377
00:24:45,422 --> 00:24:47,686
- Tell your boss that l'm in his van.
- Yes.

378
00:24:57,935 --> 00:24:59,368
What's going on, Mahi?
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

379
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,870
You left your shoot to come here?

380
00:25:01,939 --> 00:25:04,373
You didn't even tell me.
Are you spying on me?

381
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:06,699
Why? Can't l come?

382
00:25:07,545 --> 00:25:09,410
Aryan, this love making scene
wasn't in the script.

383
00:25:09,747 --> 00:25:11,510
There's only a month for the film's release.

384
00:25:11,715 --> 00:25:13,273
And suddenly this scene pops up?

385
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,439
For God sake, Mahi.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

386
00:25:15,452 --> 00:25:17,784
The director thought this was crucial
for the second half...

387
00:25:17,855 --> 00:25:18,844
so he added the scene.

388
00:25:19,423 --> 00:25:19,980
ls that so?

389
00:25:20,758 --> 00:25:21,850
Why didn't you tell me about it?

390
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,552
What does that mean?
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

391
00:25:25,496 --> 00:25:27,521
Since when are we discussing
each other's scenes?

392
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:29,030
Why can't we?

393
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:31,000
We are even getting married soon.

394
00:25:35,506 --> 00:25:38,532
The fact is you don't want to commit.

395
00:25:39,343 --> 00:25:41,368
You want to keep
this macho playboy image...

396
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:44,548
and add such scenes
whenever you want to!

397
00:25:44,615 --> 00:25:45,775
l can't believe this, Mahi.

398
00:25:47,551 --> 00:25:49,382
l'm divorcing lsha.
What else do you want?

399
00:25:49,453 --> 00:25:50,818
The divorce is not because of me.

400
00:25:51,755 --> 00:25:53,347
We've been together for a year...

401
00:25:53,591 --> 00:25:56,458
while you filed for your divorce
a year and a half ago.

402
00:25:56,594 --> 00:25:57,322
l am not a fool.

403
00:25:57,528 --> 00:25:58,995
l know everything,
okay?!

404
00:25:59,496 --> 00:26:01,327
l don't know, Mahi...
how do l explain things...

405
00:26:01,732 --> 00:26:04,292
l'm tired of your explanations.

406
00:26:04,368 --> 00:26:05,596
l want a commitment...

407
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,398
do you understand that?

408
00:26:07,905 --> 00:26:10,271
- lf you can't commit then...
- Then what?

409
00:26:10,808 --> 00:26:11,536
Then what, Mahi?

410
00:26:13,444 --> 00:26:15,002
lsha keeps nagging me
because of you and...

411
00:26:17,748 --> 00:26:19,238
l can't deal with this, Mahi.

412
00:26:20,684 --> 00:26:24,620
Mahi, l think we should
take a break.

413
00:26:27,892 --> 00:26:28,916
We won't see each other
for a few days.

414
00:26:30,494 --> 00:26:31,859
lt will give us both time to think.

415
00:26:33,464 --> 00:26:34,863
Hopefully, until then my divorce
will also be through.

416
00:26:36,734 --> 00:26:38,258
Let's see how it goes from there.

417
00:26:39,703 --> 00:26:39,998
Aryan...

418
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,469
you know l didn't mean to say that.

419
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:46,867
l love you.

420
00:26:48,812 --> 00:26:51,303
l hate that you keep this a secret.

421
00:26:52,783 --> 00:26:55,877
At parties... you behave like a co-star.

422
00:26:57,454 --> 00:26:58,785
lt scares me.

423
00:26:59,924 --> 00:27:01,323
lt scares me a lot...

424
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,921
that you too will abandon me.

425
00:27:10,601 --> 00:27:12,831
Why is this stuff so complicated?!

426
00:27:12,903 --> 00:27:14,598
l just want us to be happy.

427
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,803
Please don't leave me,
please!

428
00:27:21,412 --> 00:27:22,777
Please!

429
00:27:24,648 --> 00:27:26,343
Hi Gayatri.

430
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:28,317
- Hi Rihan, how are you?
- How are you?

431
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:29,745
Good, come... sit.

432
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,017
What's going on? No gossip...

433
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,518
You have to give me something.

434
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:36,388
What's the latest inside scoop?

435
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,725
- You want some hot gossip?
- Yeah, baby, of course!

436
00:27:40,297 --> 00:27:40,956
Come here.

437
00:27:41,298 --> 00:27:43,357
Our shoot was interrupted
because of Mahi.

438
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:44,900
Oh really?

439
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:50,899
- This is tomorrow's headline.
- Okay!

440
00:27:51,709 --> 00:27:54,337
Are you reading the book or
just looking at it...

441
00:27:54,578 --> 00:27:56,569
like other actresses?

442
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,769
Very funny!

443
00:27:58,749 --> 00:28:00,046
This is just not done.

444
00:28:00,284 --> 00:28:02,479
Mahi, get hold of yourself.

445
00:28:03,287 --> 00:28:05,448
Constant medication is not the answer.

446
00:28:07,658 --> 00:28:09,785
Practice self-control.

447
00:28:10,527 --> 00:28:13,394
Think positive... that's the best treatment.

448
00:28:14,765 --> 00:28:16,630
Tanvi, right now l don't want a lecture.

449
00:28:17,668 --> 00:28:18,794
l need my medication.

450
00:28:19,737 --> 00:28:21,398
Are you writing the prescription...

451
00:28:21,972 --> 00:28:22,904
or should l go somewhere else?

452
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,672
- Mahi...
- Write the damn prescription, will you!

453
00:28:30,748 --> 00:28:31,476
Whatever!

454
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:40,722
And now...

455
00:28:41,025 --> 00:28:44,256
the Best Debut of the Year - Female goes to...

456
00:28:44,328 --> 00:28:45,920
the gorgeous, the beautiful...

457
00:28:45,963 --> 00:28:47,624
Shaheen Khan!

458
00:28:47,698 --> 00:28:48,494
Wow...

459
00:28:51,402 --> 00:28:52,960
- Congratulations!
- Thank you so much!

460
00:28:53,037 --> 00:28:54,561
- Well done.
- Thank you!

461
00:28:57,941 --> 00:28:59,272
Thank you!

462
00:28:59,676 --> 00:29:00,267
Thanks!

463
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,408
Debut of the year, wow!

464
00:29:05,816 --> 00:29:06,840
Thanks to mom.

465
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:07,941
Thanks to my friends.

466
00:29:08,218 --> 00:29:09,207
Thanks to my director.

467
00:29:09,286 --> 00:29:10,480
Thank you so much.

468
00:29:10,554 --> 00:29:14,490
This award is dedicated to
all the small town girls...

469
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:15,820
who dream to make it big in Bollywood.

470
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:23,323
That's it!
Her career is over.

471
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,389
How is that?

472
00:29:24,902 --> 00:29:25,834
lt's bad luck.

473
00:29:25,903 --> 00:29:30,602
My mom says, whoever got this award
never made it big.

474
00:29:31,408 --> 00:29:33,968
l was also offered this award
but l refused.

475
00:29:34,478 --> 00:29:35,911
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

476
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:38,880
The Monarch Universal
lifetime achievement award.

477
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:40,416
May l please call on stage...

478
00:29:40,484 --> 00:29:41,815
the yesteryear legend...

479
00:29:41,885 --> 00:29:43,352
Shagufta Rizvi.

480
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,751
And to present the award...

481
00:29:44,822 --> 00:29:48,314
may l call on stage Mahi Arora and...

482
00:29:48,392 --> 00:29:52,556
MD of Monarch Universal,
Mr. Hasmukh Thakur.

483
00:29:54,965 --> 00:29:58,628
Congratulations Shaguftaji,
we are so happy for you.

484
00:29:58,702 --> 00:29:59,862
Come please.

485
00:30:16,553 --> 00:30:17,281
Thank you!

486
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,514
Good evening everyone.

487
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:29,925
People talk a lot after winning an award.

488
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:32,566
But l won't say a lot.

489
00:30:33,504 --> 00:30:38,908
lf you start counting your memories,
their value fades away.

490
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:43,311
That's why,
l want to extend my gratitude to all the people...

491
00:30:43,347 --> 00:30:47,647
who stood by me through everything...

492
00:30:49,419 --> 00:30:53,913
and especially, to those who
didn't stand by me.

493
00:30:55,826 --> 00:31:03,028
Because it is from them that
l learnt the most about life.

494
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,497
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

495
00:31:13,343 --> 00:31:14,571
Akil bhai, nothing doing.

496
00:31:14,945 --> 00:31:17,709
The deal was of 10 million
and an award.

497
00:31:18,682 --> 00:31:20,582
You can't back out
at the last minute.

498
00:31:20,717 --> 00:31:21,843
Listen Gayatri...

499
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,355
Everybody knows that
the 'Mahi and Aryan' pair is very popular.

500
00:31:25,822 --> 00:31:28,552
They will get the
'Number one pair' award.

501
00:31:29,293 --> 00:31:30,453
Popular, my foot!

502
00:31:31,395 --> 00:31:33,295
Their pair if popular
only in the magazines.

503
00:31:33,964 --> 00:31:36,330
My last picture with Aryan
was a super hit!

504
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:38,667
Especially overseas.

505
00:31:38,735 --> 00:31:40,999
And, our next film as a pair
is out in two weeks.

506
00:31:43,774 --> 00:31:45,401
lf l don't get this award...

507
00:31:46,643 --> 00:31:47,837
l won't perform on stage.

508
00:31:47,945 --> 00:31:49,344
You won't perform?

509
00:31:49,713 --> 00:31:53,046
But Gayatri,
the award is decided by ajury.

510
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:55,476
- How can we...
- We can't do anything.

511
00:31:55,552 --> 00:31:56,382
Okay.

512
00:31:56,954 --> 00:32:00,321
Then why don't you get
the jury to perform.

513
00:32:03,427 --> 00:32:04,325
Let me know.

514
00:32:07,664 --> 00:32:08,289
Okay!

515
00:32:08,632 --> 00:32:10,463
Come, let's talk to Aryan.

516
00:32:11,802 --> 00:32:13,633
Hell yeah!

517
00:32:13,904 --> 00:32:15,337
Hello beautiful...

518
00:32:22,813 --> 00:32:24,940
- What?
- Make up, baby.

519
00:32:28,552 --> 00:32:29,644
You look gorgeous.

520
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,718
Really?

521
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:32,878
What is it?

522
00:32:34,591 --> 00:32:36,582
Nothing.
Just missing you.

523
00:32:38,362 --> 00:32:39,727
- Really?
- Yes.

524
00:32:40,397 --> 00:32:43,594
Coming into my room
just before a performance...

525
00:32:44,968 --> 00:32:46,765
that means
you want something.

526
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:48,764
Tell me.

527
00:32:50,707 --> 00:32:52,538
You really know me very well.

528
00:32:53,477 --> 00:32:54,808
Actually... the thing is...

529
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,039
l have a request.

530
00:32:57,914 --> 00:32:59,609
Aryan Khanna... A request...

531
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:02,513
This is serious.

532
00:33:03,654 --> 00:33:04,848
Baby, the thing is...

533
00:33:05,689 --> 00:33:07,680
my film with Gayatri
is due for release.

534
00:33:08,325 --> 00:33:10,953
And the producer of the film
was wondering if the award...

535
00:33:11,028 --> 00:33:12,825
that you and l were to get...

536
00:33:12,896 --> 00:33:15,023
was given to Gayatri and me.

537
00:33:15,932 --> 00:33:17,866
You know,
it would boost the publicity.

538
00:33:18,035 --> 00:33:19,468
But that's...

539
00:33:19,836 --> 00:33:20,928
that's only if it is okay with you.

540
00:33:21,371 --> 00:33:22,030
Really.

541
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:25,271
What do you want?

542
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:33,345
Yes.

543
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:37,516
That's it?

544
00:33:38,588 --> 00:33:40,351
l'd have said yes
even if you had sent a text.

545
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:43,623
Who cares about
a 'number one pair' award with you!

546
00:33:45,796 --> 00:33:47,696
You and l are the real pair, right?

547
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:51,357
Always, my sweetheart.

548
00:33:52,703 --> 00:33:54,637
- Make up!
- l don't care, baby.

549
00:38:12,996 --> 00:38:15,294
- Prem, please cover that.
- lt's covered.

550
00:38:15,865 --> 00:38:17,332
Look at dad, Akshat.

551
00:38:17,701 --> 00:38:19,896
lt's quite dangerous
to perform such stunts.

552
00:38:22,405 --> 00:38:23,372
How cool.

553
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,340
l will also become a hero like dad...

554
00:38:25,442 --> 00:38:27,410
and do Superman movies!

555
00:38:27,844 --> 00:38:29,277
- Of course you...
- Akshat!

556
00:38:29,346 --> 00:38:31,644
How many times have l told you
not to talk to strangers.

557
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:34,849
You talk tojust about anybody!

558
00:38:34,985 --> 00:38:35,610
Let's go!

559
00:38:41,791 --> 00:38:43,349
Don't pull it.

560
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,720
lt goes off balance.

561
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:52,994
Stranger?

562
00:38:53,303 --> 00:38:54,327
l mean, how dare she...

563
00:38:54,571 --> 00:38:55,401
Relax.

564
00:38:55,472 --> 00:38:56,939
Mahi... relax.

565
00:38:57,407 --> 00:38:58,533
Just listen to me.

566
00:38:58,642 --> 00:39:01,941
Aryan is with you.
He is divorcing lsha.

567
00:39:02,212 --> 00:39:04,510
lt's obvious lsha is
venting her anger at you!

568
00:39:04,948 --> 00:39:05,710
Andy...

569
00:39:05,915 --> 00:39:08,611
Aryan should control lsha,
he didn't say a word to her.

570
00:39:08,685 --> 00:39:09,845
How could he?

571
00:39:09,919 --> 00:39:11,216
He was busy in the shoot.

572
00:39:11,454 --> 00:39:12,751
He did not even know, darling.

573
00:39:13,723 --> 00:39:17,716
Mahi, listen,
it doesn't matter what lsha does.

574
00:39:17,961 --> 00:39:19,952
Aryan is serious about you.

575
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,288
Nothing else matters.

576
00:39:21,564 --> 00:39:22,553
Bullshit!

577
00:39:22,632 --> 00:39:24,623
lf he is so serious about you...

578
00:39:24,668 --> 00:39:27,262
then why did he tell you not to attend
Rohan's anniversary party?

579
00:39:27,537 --> 00:39:29,937
That's not what Aryan said.

580
00:39:30,006 --> 00:39:33,339
All he said is, come to the party
after lsha leaves.

581
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,240
Right Mahi?

582
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,709
So tell me, what's wrong in that?

583
00:39:35,879 --> 00:39:38,370
- Right Rats?
- lf you ask me, everything!

584
00:39:39,549 --> 00:39:42,382
Mahi, Rohan is your co-star too.

585
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:44,450
And he has also invited you.

586
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:46,450
Why can't you attend?

587
00:39:46,756 --> 00:39:48,348
Of course she can.

588
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:50,916
- But a little later.
- l don't think Mahi should go late...

589
00:39:50,994 --> 00:39:52,552
That's nonsense Rats.

590
00:39:52,629 --> 00:39:55,029
Why do you always have to
complicate things?

591
00:39:56,332 --> 00:39:57,356
Seriously...

592
00:39:58,435 --> 00:39:59,493
Oh, really?

593
00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:00,763
Oh! Of course you are
looking fabulous.

594
00:40:00,804 --> 00:40:02,499
You make a lovely couple.

595
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,964
Thank you so much, Abbas.

596
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:08,704
lt's our anniversary and
you are throwing this party!

597
00:40:08,778 --> 00:40:09,608
lt's really sweet of you.

598
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:10,737
Don't be silly.

599
00:40:10,814 --> 00:40:12,475
This was Zara's idea.

600
00:40:12,549 --> 00:40:13,538
Thank my lovely wife.

601
00:40:15,318 --> 00:40:16,376
Yeah totally.

602
00:40:17,554 --> 00:40:19,920
These actresses are unbelievable!

603
00:40:19,989 --> 00:40:22,924
She is cozing up to Rohan's wife...

604
00:40:22,992 --> 00:40:24,983
to land a role in his next film.

605
00:40:25,061 --> 00:40:26,756
Such a fraud!

606
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,762
Come on!

607
00:40:27,831 --> 00:40:30,766
Who isn't!

608
00:40:30,834 --> 00:40:33,462
Well, Rohan's wife was also an actress.

609
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:36,369
She want let it happen.

610
00:40:37,474 --> 00:40:38,702
l like that!

611
00:40:38,775 --> 00:40:39,605
l'll catch you around.

612
00:40:39,676 --> 00:40:41,473
- Hey!
- Cheers!

613
00:40:42,412 --> 00:40:43,344
Hey beautiful...

614
00:40:43,413 --> 00:40:45,472
Shaheen Khan, she is hot.

615
00:40:46,382 --> 00:40:47,371
What's the report?

616
00:40:47,517 --> 00:40:49,678
Sameer Khan has been recommending her.

617
00:40:49,753 --> 00:40:50,720
Really?

618
00:40:50,854 --> 00:40:54,415
She is okay at acting
but nothing to be excited about.

619
00:40:55,325 --> 00:40:57,919
l've heard that she doesn't meet
her co-stars after pack-up.

620
00:40:58,061 --> 00:40:59,961
You know a lot about her.

621
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:04,959
Before that Danish Kapoor makes
a move on her...

622
00:41:05,735 --> 00:41:07,032
l have to do a film with her.

623
00:41:07,437 --> 00:41:08,426
Easy, Rohan.

624
00:41:08,505 --> 00:41:10,564
lt's your first anniversary.

625
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,006
Or you'll end up using my divorce lawyer.

626
00:41:13,777 --> 00:41:14,402
True!

627
00:41:14,778 --> 00:41:17,338
Thank you, Angad.
Thank you so much.

628
00:41:17,413 --> 00:41:20,041
l'm glad you took some time off
from the cricket series.

629
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,441
Oh come on!
You're like a sister to me.

630
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,011
l won a five day match in four,
just for you.

631
00:41:27,557 --> 00:41:28,581
You're too sweet!

632
00:41:28,758 --> 00:41:31,386
Come on guys, we have to
take a picture!

633
00:41:31,594 --> 00:41:33,960
- Oh yeah!
- Anything for you Gayatri.

634
00:41:47,844 --> 00:41:48,708
Hi Zara.

635
00:41:48,778 --> 00:41:50,040
Mahi?

636
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,669
Sorry, l'm late.

637
00:41:51,748 --> 00:41:52,840
Yeah.

638
00:41:53,016 --> 00:41:54,847
Congratulations Sheena.

639
00:41:54,918 --> 00:41:56,510
Thanks, Mahi.

640
00:41:56,586 --> 00:41:59,714
lt's really not easy to spend
a year with Rohan.

641
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:00,983
You deserve an award for that.

642
00:42:01,391 --> 00:42:04,758
Mahi, let's get you a drink.

643
00:42:06,362 --> 00:42:08,330
l will help myself.

644
00:42:08,364 --> 00:42:10,025
- Don't worry, Zara.
- Okay.

645
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,427
Guys, let's just chill.

646
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,669
- The worst thing that can ever..
- Hi!

647
00:42:18,975 --> 00:42:20,533
Congratulations, Rohan.

648
00:42:21,678 --> 00:42:22,337
What's up, Danish?

649
00:42:22,412 --> 00:42:23,344
Hi Mahi...

650
00:42:23,413 --> 00:42:24,846
Thanks, Mahi.

651
00:42:25,548 --> 00:42:26,947
What a surprise!

652
00:42:27,016 --> 00:42:29,917
Did you think l wouldn't come?

653
00:42:34,657 --> 00:42:35,555
Have fun, Rohan.

654
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,392
Bye.

655
00:42:43,032 --> 00:42:43,760
Yes ma'am.

656
00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:46,400
- A glass of red wine, please.
- Sure.

657
00:42:51,307 --> 00:42:51,898
Your drink ma'am.

658
00:42:58,681 --> 00:43:00,080
What's this nonsense, Mahi?

659
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:02,312
l told you not to come here.

660
00:43:02,986 --> 00:43:03,714
Please leave.

661
00:43:04,287 --> 00:43:05,254
Why?

662
00:43:05,688 --> 00:43:09,556
Rohan is my friend too.
l am invited as well.

663
00:43:09,692 --> 00:43:12,957
Stop this drama and leave!

664
00:43:14,797 --> 00:43:16,389
What's the problem?

665
00:43:16,466 --> 00:43:18,366
Every one here knows about us.

666
00:43:19,435 --> 00:43:20,459
Why do you hide it?

667
00:43:20,737 --> 00:43:23,501
Mahi, this isn't the place
to talk about it.

668
00:43:25,909 --> 00:43:26,933
Don't worry, Aryan.

669
00:43:28,544 --> 00:43:30,671
lt doesn't matter how you treat me...

670
00:43:32,882 --> 00:43:34,747
l won't embarrass you.

671
00:43:37,654 --> 00:43:38,712
Because l love you.

672
00:43:39,822 --> 00:43:40,550
Damn it, Mahi!

673
00:43:43,626 --> 00:43:44,650
A vodka tonic please.

674
00:43:44,827 --> 00:43:45,418
Sure sir.

675
00:43:48,998 --> 00:43:51,831
Mahi, leaving so soon?

676
00:43:56,572 --> 00:43:59,006
At least finish your drink.

677
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:17,616
There, l've finished it.

678
00:44:26,302 --> 00:44:27,530
And by the way...

679
00:44:28,705 --> 00:44:30,502
l'm not leaving!

680
00:45:02,305 --> 00:45:03,772
lt's not my fault Aryan...

681
00:45:04,974 --> 00:45:05,770
l couldn't help it.

682
00:45:07,543 --> 00:45:09,534
You only think about your image.

683
00:45:10,813 --> 00:45:12,781
Does it matter to you
what people say about me?

684
00:45:14,684 --> 00:45:15,548
That l am a loser.

685
00:45:16,886 --> 00:45:17,978
And l am sick of it.

686
00:45:20,556 --> 00:45:22,524
l was on my way out.

687
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,418
But that b**** of a wife you have...

688
00:45:25,828 --> 00:45:28,023
why did she have to talk to me?

689
00:45:28,297 --> 00:45:29,628
What the f*** does she mean...

690
00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:31,997
at least finish your drink!

691
00:45:32,268 --> 00:45:33,792
She provoked me.

692
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:34,802
l had to do something.

693
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,897
You never say anything to her.

694
00:45:38,975 --> 00:45:39,907
So l had to!

695
00:45:47,383 --> 00:45:49,317
Aryan, say something.

696
00:45:53,623 --> 00:45:56,592
Every time l talk about us...

697
00:45:56,659 --> 00:45:57,990
you never say a word.

698
00:45:58,694 --> 00:46:01,561
Can't you see,
it is driving me crazy?!

699
00:46:04,567 --> 00:46:06,899
Aryan, l really need to know.

700
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:09,995
Do we have a future?

701
00:46:10,339 --> 00:46:11,533
Or are you just using me?

702
00:46:13,743 --> 00:46:15,438
l can't deal with this any more!

703
00:46:22,585 --> 00:46:23,950
Aryan, this isn't a film.

704
00:46:24,821 --> 00:46:25,685
Say something...

705
00:46:25,755 --> 00:46:27,347
l need to know.

706
00:46:27,723 --> 00:46:28,917
Why the f*** aren't you reacting??

707
00:46:28,991 --> 00:46:30,618
You want me to f****** react?

708
00:46:36,332 --> 00:46:37,560
Mahi, just get out.

709
00:46:38,468 --> 00:46:39,298
What do you mean by
'get out'?

710
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:40,467
l mean just get out!

711
00:46:55,551 --> 00:46:58,418
Well known actress Mahi Arora
was seen at the local police station.

712
00:46:58,488 --> 00:47:00,752
lt's said that she was there to
lodge a complaint.

713
00:47:00,823 --> 00:47:02,620
But nothing has been confirmed yet...

714
00:47:03,893 --> 00:47:04,450
Yes, mom.

715
00:47:04,527 --> 00:47:05,824
l told you...

716
00:47:05,895 --> 00:47:07,726
don't trust that b******.

717
00:47:08,397 --> 00:47:09,295
Please, not right now!

718
00:47:09,465 --> 00:47:11,899
Why don't you come to Delhi for a few days?

719
00:47:11,968 --> 00:47:13,833
Just to get away from all this mess.

720
00:47:14,303 --> 00:47:15,565
No, l...

721
00:47:16,672 --> 00:47:19,573
Mahi...

722
00:47:20,276 --> 00:47:23,734
lt's unfortunate that you publish
any nonsense you want to.

723
00:47:23,813 --> 00:47:24,837
So you can go ahead.

724
00:47:24,914 --> 00:47:26,313
But, l'm saying this for the last time...

725
00:47:26,449 --> 00:47:28,974
Mahi is only a co-star. Nothing more.

726
00:47:29,252 --> 00:47:31,584
Superstar Aryan Khannajust confessed...

727
00:47:31,654 --> 00:47:34,817
that Mahi is only a co-star.
Nothing more.

728
00:47:45,635 --> 00:47:49,469
As ajournalist,
every time l analyzed Mahi's situation...

729
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:52,030
l couldn't help but think that she is stupid.

730
00:47:52,308 --> 00:47:54,902
But every time l met her,
l only had compassion for her.

731
00:47:55,845 --> 00:47:58,405
She was so lost...
So alone.

732
00:47:59,282 --> 00:48:01,580
She had a bi-polar disorder.

733
00:48:01,651 --> 00:48:05,553
She was looking for real emotions,
in a success crazed world.

734
00:48:05,621 --> 00:48:06,519
But alas!

735
00:48:07,256 --> 00:48:09,349
Her split with Aryan Khanna...

736
00:48:09,425 --> 00:48:11,950
her own insecurities...

737
00:48:12,228 --> 00:48:13,855
finally, the film industry.

738
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:15,864
They all supported Aryan.

739
00:48:15,932 --> 00:48:17,763
After all he was a superstar.

740
00:48:18,568 --> 00:48:21,537
Actors that Mahi had helped in the past...

741
00:48:21,571 --> 00:48:23,334
also abandoned her.

742
00:48:23,406 --> 00:48:25,897
They all ruined her.

743
00:48:28,377 --> 00:48:30,242
Mahi...

744
00:48:30,379 --> 00:48:33,371
you can only lose to others when
you've lost to yourself.

745
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,514
You always look for happiness in others.

746
00:48:36,586 --> 00:48:38,315
That's your problem.

747
00:48:38,721 --> 00:48:40,586
Look for happiness in your work.

748
00:48:40,656 --> 00:48:41,850
Concentrate on your career.

749
00:48:43,526 --> 00:48:45,756
You just have to stop playing the victim.

750
00:48:46,262 --> 00:48:47,752
Take charge!

751
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:49,957
Declare to the world,
that Mahi Arora is not over.

752
00:49:02,612 --> 00:49:03,579
Hi...

753
00:49:04,447 --> 00:49:05,471
l am Pallavi Narayan.

754
00:49:06,282 --> 00:49:06,907
Hi...

755
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:11,343
Will you have something?

756
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:11,909
No, thanks.

757
00:49:13,689 --> 00:49:14,383
Mahi...

758
00:49:14,557 --> 00:49:16,320
l'm not your regular PR person.

759
00:49:16,692 --> 00:49:17,590
l build images.

760
00:49:18,494 --> 00:49:19,586
l make brands.

761
00:49:20,963 --> 00:49:22,328
But l am already a brand.

762
00:49:22,898 --> 00:49:23,626
You are...

763
00:49:25,301 --> 00:49:26,563
but a fading brand.

764
00:49:27,503 --> 00:49:28,731
You have two small budget films...

765
00:49:28,804 --> 00:49:31,238
some mid-level endorsements.

766
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:34,736
lf you don't take charge,
you will soon be over.

767
00:49:35,845 --> 00:49:38,313
l have prepared a rough strategy for you
for the next year.

768
00:49:40,249 --> 00:49:42,740
The first three months
we will build your image.

769
00:49:42,785 --> 00:49:46,721
The next quarter we will get some,
A-list endorsements for you.

770
00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:47,619
And then...

771
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:50,625
focus on some A-list films and
by the end of the year...

772
00:49:50,926 --> 00:49:51,893
you will be back!

773
00:49:51,961 --> 00:49:53,394
Bingo!

774
00:49:53,462 --> 00:49:54,520
With a brand new image.

775
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,425
When the old image is so strong...

776
00:50:02,271 --> 00:50:02,930
how can we build a new one?

777
00:50:04,006 --> 00:50:05,473
You will do it.

778
00:50:06,542 --> 00:50:08,635
lf you say something confidently...

779
00:50:08,711 --> 00:50:10,679
then film industry even takes
the lie for a truth.

780
00:50:11,947 --> 00:50:14,040
Your image is very confusing.

781
00:50:14,717 --> 00:50:17,584
Neither a wild child
nor conventional.

782
00:50:18,421 --> 00:50:21,788
The film industry doesn't like
confusing images.

783
00:50:21,857 --> 00:50:22,983
But now that's over.

784
00:50:23,426 --> 00:50:25,621
Your image will be of a
powerful star.

785
00:50:26,028 --> 00:50:29,395
Who will be very confident
about her every move.

786
00:50:30,766 --> 00:50:32,358
No matter what's troubling you...

787
00:50:33,035 --> 00:50:35,299
always look confident.

788
00:50:36,305 --> 00:50:37,795
You have to be a player now.

789
00:51:21,417 --> 00:51:22,714
l will have a...

790
00:51:22,785 --> 00:51:24,377
Vodka with coconut water.

791
00:51:26,055 --> 00:51:26,987
How do you know?.

792
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:29,685
l know a lot about you.

793
00:51:29,759 --> 00:51:30,953
Your favorite color,
turquoise blue.

794
00:51:31,026 --> 00:51:34,325
Your favorite non-vegetarian food,
lamb ribs.

795
00:51:34,397 --> 00:51:36,558
Your favorite holiday destination,
Koh Samui.

796
00:51:38,701 --> 00:51:39,292
Don't worry.

797
00:51:41,404 --> 00:51:42,632
l'm not stalking you.

798
00:51:43,472 --> 00:51:46,066
Film magazines help me fall asleep.

799
00:51:49,311 --> 00:51:51,871
Hi... Angad Paul.

800
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:54,974
Who doesn't know you?!

801
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:56,881
Vice-captain of the lndian Cricket team.

802
00:51:59,388 --> 00:52:01,015
You know, we've seen each other
at some parties.

803
00:52:02,691 --> 00:52:05,524
Last time, at Zara's party.

804
00:52:08,464 --> 00:52:08,793
l know.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

805
00:52:09,598 --> 00:52:10,792
l didn't want to bring it up...

806
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:12,299
l know, it was embarrassing.

807
00:52:13,903 --> 00:52:15,962
You probably thought l was a
drama queen!

808
00:52:17,006 --> 00:52:20,373
No,
l thought you have a lot of guts.

809
00:52:21,977 --> 00:52:22,966
So, everything good now?.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

810
00:52:23,879 --> 00:52:24,971
Everything's not good...
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

811
00:52:25,748 --> 00:52:26,510
but l am.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

812
00:52:27,283 --> 00:52:28,511
l have moved on.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

813
00:52:29,685 --> 00:52:30,879
And, how's Gayatri?
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

814
00:52:30,953 --> 00:52:32,818
You know... moved on.

815
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:34,981
l am so sorry.

816
00:52:35,057 --> 00:52:36,046
Why sorry?

817
00:52:36,325 --> 00:52:37,724
l'm not sorry at all.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

818
00:52:38,027 --> 00:52:40,325
Even our drama was
all over the newspapers.

819
00:52:40,396 --> 00:52:41,420
Didn't you read?
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

820
00:52:42,398 --> 00:52:44,298
l don't read newspapers and magazines.

821
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,396
Why?
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

822
00:52:45,468 --> 00:52:47,766
Who knows what people
are saying about us!

823
00:52:50,306 --> 00:52:50,795
Cheers to that.

824
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:51,829
Cheers.

825
00:52:54,009 --> 00:52:58,571
Alex, isn't Mahi looking gorgeous?

826
00:52:59,548 --> 00:53:01,015
She is,
but how does it matter?

827
00:53:01,917 --> 00:53:03,407
Who will sign her?

828
00:53:04,453 --> 00:53:07,854
She's moody, impulsive,
over-emotional.

829
00:53:09,992 --> 00:53:13,359
Alex, whether its
Hollywood or Bollywood...

830
00:53:13,429 --> 00:53:16,489
every legendary actress has
these three qualities.

831
00:53:16,565 --> 00:53:17,031
Oh yeah!

832
00:53:18,434 --> 00:53:19,765
Now, no one can stop her.

833
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:23,302
Hope she survives.

834
00:53:24,373 --> 00:53:24,998
From whom?

835
00:53:26,575 --> 00:53:27,473
Herself!

836
00:53:29,512 --> 00:53:30,843
Angad, you are crazy!

837
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,375
That's why you and l will get along well.

838
00:53:36,585 --> 00:53:37,779
l think l should leave now.

839
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,319
l just had to be here.

840
00:53:40,289 --> 00:53:41,051
l couldn't help it.

841
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:46,022
Thank you for rescuing me
from this boring party.

842
00:53:46,529 --> 00:53:47,962
lf you wish,
l can rescue you every day.

843
00:53:49,665 --> 00:53:50,859
What are you doing tomorrow?.

844
00:53:50,933 --> 00:53:52,594
Anyway, whatever you were to do,
cancel it.

845
00:53:53,502 --> 00:53:53,831
Really?

846
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:56,396
Tomorrow is my cricket match,
you must come.

847
00:53:57,573 --> 00:53:58,631
lt will be fun.

848
00:53:58,707 --> 00:53:59,401
Why?

849
00:53:59,742 --> 00:54:00,299
Why...

850
00:54:01,944 --> 00:54:04,970
Because if you do,
we will definitely win.

851
00:54:07,816 --> 00:54:08,339
l'll think about it.

852
00:54:09,385 --> 00:54:09,942
l'll try.

853
00:54:10,986 --> 00:54:11,918
Good night.

854
00:54:23,799 --> 00:54:25,289
Wow, Mahi!

855
00:54:25,367 --> 00:54:26,766
lnvitation to the match.

856
00:54:26,835 --> 00:54:29,702
That's great publicity.
Clever move.

857
00:54:29,939 --> 00:54:31,531
Pallavi, that wasn't a move.

858
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,608
lf it wasn't, then it should be.

859
00:54:34,476 --> 00:54:35,875
You have to go there tomorrow.

860
00:54:36,478 --> 00:54:37,467
Go to the match.

861
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,940
And make sure
you are seen with him.

862
00:54:42,051 --> 00:54:44,611
Angad Paul is a great catch.

863
00:54:46,355 --> 00:54:48,016
Pallavi, he is a really nice guy.

864
00:54:48,557 --> 00:54:50,923
But to manipulate him...

865
00:54:50,993 --> 00:54:52,358
Mahi Arora...

866
00:54:52,595 --> 00:54:53,687
this is the film industry.

867
00:54:53,862 --> 00:54:57,992
Either you manipulate
or get manipulated.

868
00:54:59,535 --> 00:55:00,763
The choice is yours, babes!

869
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:14,706
- Thanks, Lobo.
- Your welcome sir.

870
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:21,406
l was under a lot of pressure before the sixer.

871
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:22,708
So what did you do?

872
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,580
lf l can't concentrate, l sing.

873
00:56:28,624 --> 00:56:32,458
When the bowler is taking his run-up,
l start singing.

874
00:56:32,528 --> 00:56:34,428
At that time l was singing...

875
00:56:34,496 --> 00:56:36,657
Khoya Khoya Chand...

876
00:56:36,732 --> 00:56:38,427
Khula aasmaan...

877
00:56:40,669 --> 00:56:42,432
...and then took a shot!

878
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:44,396
You really are mad!

879
00:56:44,873 --> 00:56:49,537
By the way,
my team is grateful to you for my century.

880
00:56:50,379 --> 00:56:50,970
And so am l.

881
00:56:52,014 --> 00:56:53,003
Grateful?

882
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:55,743
Excuse me.

883
00:56:57,553 --> 00:56:58,042
Yes..

884
00:56:58,353 --> 00:56:59,320
Mahi...

885
00:56:59,388 --> 00:57:01,356
in exactly ten minutes,
leave the restaurant.

886
00:57:01,724 --> 00:57:02,918
And don't forget...

887
00:57:03,525 --> 00:57:03,991
look surprised.

888
00:57:05,494 --> 00:57:06,825
Yes, l will see you soon.

889
00:57:06,895 --> 00:57:08,886
Okay, yeah bye.

890
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:11,823
What is it?

891
00:57:12,868 --> 00:57:14,358
Nothing. Let's go?

892
00:57:14,536 --> 00:57:15,503
Sure.

893
01:00:19,454 --> 01:00:20,478
Yes, we will meet tomorrow.

894
01:00:20,989 --> 01:00:21,978
Yeah!

895
01:00:28,897 --> 01:00:29,829
Shaguftaji...

896
01:00:32,534 --> 01:00:33,523
how are you?

897
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:35,902
How are you, Mahi?

898
01:00:36,071 --> 01:00:38,403
l'm alright,
l was shooting on the next floor.

899
01:00:38,473 --> 01:00:38,905
What are you doing here?

900
01:00:39,441 --> 01:00:41,375
l have a shoot on this floor.

901
01:00:42,778 --> 01:00:44,678
Why are you sitting here, in this heat?

902
01:00:44,913 --> 01:00:45,902
Where's your van?

903
01:00:46,581 --> 01:00:47,673
l guess l don't have one.

904
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:52,543
Since it's only a three day job,
l didn't get one...

905
01:00:52,788 --> 01:00:53,948
You didn't?

906
01:00:56,992 --> 01:00:58,550
- Excuse me!
- Yeah!

907
01:00:58,794 --> 01:01:00,421
- are you from the production team?
- Yes.

908
01:01:00,495 --> 01:01:01,792
Take care of that.

909
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:02,792
Yes, ma'am.

910
01:01:02,898 --> 01:01:04,490
Where's Shaguftaji's van?

911
01:01:05,267 --> 01:01:07,462
- Don't worry Mahi...
- What do l say!

912
01:01:07,936 --> 01:01:11,463
The producer's wife keeps a tab
on every little thing.

913
01:01:11,907 --> 01:01:14,876
A van for a character artist?
You tell me?

914
01:01:15,477 --> 01:01:16,944
l am helpless.
l am sorry.

915
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,338
Shaguftaji, please come with me...

916
01:01:19,414 --> 01:01:20,438
l'll manage.

917
01:01:20,649 --> 01:01:22,844
When the shot is ready,
you can fetch her from my van.

918
01:01:22,918 --> 01:01:25,409
- Yes, ma'am.
- Shaguftaji, please come.

919
01:01:29,791 --> 01:01:33,420
Mahi, why do you get so upset?

920
01:01:34,529 --> 01:01:36,292
l am used to these things.

921
01:01:36,832 --> 01:01:39,733
We didn't have these vans
when l was a young star.

922
01:01:40,302 --> 01:01:42,998
We would open an umbrella, sit under it...

923
01:01:43,372 --> 01:01:44,737
and start shooting.

924
01:01:47,476 --> 01:01:49,410
lt must've been difficult back then...

925
01:01:49,478 --> 01:01:50,376
no privacy?

926
01:01:50,679 --> 01:01:51,805
l don't know, Mahi.

927
01:01:52,314 --> 01:01:56,045
The entire film unit would
do things together.

928
01:01:56,385 --> 01:02:01,413
Directors, heroes, heroines,
side actors, junior artists...

929
01:02:01,523 --> 01:02:03,718
everyone had a good time.

930
01:02:03,959 --> 01:02:07,690
That's why nothing seemed difficult,
l guess.

931
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:12,433
ln those days,
relationships were valued a lot.

932
01:02:13,435 --> 01:02:15,960
These days its fame and success.

933
01:02:16,371 --> 01:02:18,635
But don't we become actors
for fame and success?

934
01:02:18,774 --> 01:02:20,002
Yes, we do.

935
01:02:20,442 --> 01:02:21,932
Whatever fame gives us...

936
01:02:22,344 --> 01:02:24,835
it takes away a lot more from us.

937
01:02:25,814 --> 01:02:28,578
We fail to see in the glow of glamour...

938
01:02:29,284 --> 01:02:31,479
how much we have lost.

939
01:02:31,686 --> 01:02:35,679
When we realize it, it's often too late.

940
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:43,020
Everything is on schedule.

941
01:02:43,298 --> 01:02:44,458
l am so happy, Mahi.

942
01:02:44,866 --> 01:02:46,959
Seven A-list endorsements
in four months.

943
01:02:47,502 --> 01:02:50,528
11 high profile events and
you are on every cover page.

944
01:02:50,806 --> 01:02:51,932
l think we are on the right track.

945
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:54,399
lt's all thanks to you, Pallavi.

946
01:02:54,609 --> 01:02:57,339
That's all very nice but
you are essentially a heroine.

947
01:02:57,579 --> 01:02:59,444
You have to sign a film.

948
01:03:00,082 --> 01:03:00,912
Rashid bhai!

949
01:03:01,917 --> 01:03:03,350
l think he is absolutely right.

950
01:03:04,286 --> 01:03:07,551
A heroine gets commercials and
endorsements based on her films.

951
01:03:07,789 --> 01:03:09,814
And, it's high time you signed a film.

952
01:03:14,362 --> 01:03:14,885
Abbas Khan...

953
01:03:15,797 --> 01:03:17,424
is making the remake of
a super hit South lndian film.

954
01:03:17,799 --> 01:03:19,027
He's also shooting the entire film abroad.

955
01:03:19,701 --> 01:03:21,498
lf you get this film...

956
01:03:21,937 --> 01:03:22,995
you are home!

957
01:03:24,339 --> 01:03:27,536
But l've heard that
he is considering Rhea Mehra.

958
01:03:28,343 --> 01:03:31,005
Gayatri is also desperate to get it.

959
01:03:32,848 --> 01:03:33,872
So, what are my chances?

960
01:03:34,683 --> 01:03:36,947
We will know the answer to that
only if you try.

961
01:03:37,652 --> 01:03:38,619
lt's very simple.

962
01:03:39,387 --> 01:03:41,651
Either you join Rhea and Gayatri in the race...

963
01:03:41,723 --> 01:03:43,748
and defeat them.

964
01:03:43,825 --> 01:03:45,793
Or sit here and accept defeat.

965
01:03:46,795 --> 01:03:47,693
lt's up to you.

966
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:52,994
Mind blowing.

967
01:03:53,068 --> 01:03:54,501
Excellent shot.

968
01:03:55,871 --> 01:03:56,667
We will set up for the next shot?

969
01:03:56,738 --> 01:03:57,432
Yes, sure.

970
01:03:57,472 --> 01:03:58,029
Okay!

971
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,541
l'm at a shoot, mom.
Talk to you later.

972
01:04:06,615 --> 01:04:08,845
Just a minute, it's urgent.

973
01:04:09,451 --> 01:04:12,750
Pratap's political party is organizing
a cleanliness drive in Mumbai.

974
01:04:12,821 --> 01:04:15,312
He wants you to attend the event.

975
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:17,620
Forjust 10 minutes,
as the chief guest.

976
01:04:17,692 --> 01:04:20,388
Tell him to contact Rashid bhai
and to finalize a deal in 2 million.

977
01:04:20,695 --> 01:04:22,720
What? Are you crazy?

978
01:04:22,797 --> 01:04:25,823
You will charge your mother?
That too for a social cause?

979
01:04:26,001 --> 01:04:27,400
Stop over reacting, mom.

980
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,996
lt's the ruling party and they are loaded.

981
01:04:30,805 --> 01:04:32,705
l'm doing it for 2 only for you
otherwise l charge 3 million!

982
01:04:33,008 --> 01:04:33,804
Mahi, please.

983
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:35,638
l've promised Pratap.
You know...

984
01:04:35,844 --> 01:04:38,039
Mom, l don't have time for this.
We'll talk later.

985
01:04:42,017 --> 01:04:42,881
Surekha, come on.

986
01:04:42,951 --> 01:04:43,440
Yes.

987
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:55,386
Rhea has been celebrating her
25th birthday for the past five years!

988
01:04:56,598 --> 01:04:57,360
Surekha...

989
01:04:57,866 --> 01:04:59,527
They write such things about every heroine.

990
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:01,429
No, you don't know.

991
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:02,864
She is very shrewd.

992
01:05:03,471 --> 01:05:06,702
l know her since she was
a struggling model.

993
01:05:08,009 --> 01:05:11,945
She knows very well how to be at the right place,
at the right time.

994
01:05:12,013 --> 01:05:13,810
She will do anything to achieve her goal.

995
01:05:14,249 --> 01:05:14,772
Madam...

996
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:15,780
Anything.

997
01:05:17,485 --> 01:05:21,387
She is at least 31 years old.

998
01:05:21,856 --> 01:05:25,724
She forged her age in her
birth certificate and passport.

999
01:05:25,961 --> 01:05:26,655
l know it.

1000
01:05:26,695 --> 01:05:27,684
lt's true.

1001
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:30,530
Remember the film 'Bad Boys'?

1002
01:05:30,899 --> 01:05:32,867
She made a passport before that film.

1003
01:05:33,401 --> 01:05:35,301
Anyway, what have l got to do with it.

1004
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:36,701
l like to focus on my job.

1005
01:05:36,871 --> 01:05:39,465
l'm not at all interested in such gossip.

1006
01:05:40,442 --> 01:05:41,306
l forgot something...

1007
01:05:41,376 --> 01:05:42,001
the flowers!

1008
01:05:42,277 --> 01:05:43,437
Madam, l'll get the flowers.

1009
01:05:57,926 --> 01:05:58,415
Hi mom...

1010
01:05:58,994 --> 01:06:01,690
what were you saying about
Pratap Khurana's rally?

1011
01:06:03,565 --> 01:06:06,295
Fine, tell him l will do it.

1012
01:06:07,369 --> 01:06:07,664
Done deal.

1013
01:06:08,637 --> 01:06:13,472
Long live, Pratap Khurana!

1014
01:06:23,852 --> 01:06:26,753
Mahi...

1015
01:06:38,867 --> 01:06:41,495
l request Mahi to say a few words.

1016
01:06:42,904 --> 01:06:43,598
Thank you!

1017
01:06:44,472 --> 01:06:46,997
Actually, l don't know a lot about politics.

1018
01:06:47,742 --> 01:06:48,766
But what l do know is that...

1019
01:06:48,843 --> 01:06:51,676
a cleanliness drive is important for every city.

1020
01:06:52,047 --> 01:06:56,313
l'm happy that Pratapji and the national party
have organized this.

1021
01:06:56,685 --> 01:06:59,677
And l shall begin
the drive from his constituency.

1022
01:07:01,856 --> 01:07:03,653
Say it with me...

1023
01:07:03,725 --> 01:07:08,458
Clean Mumbai, Healthy Mumbai!

1024
01:07:24,546 --> 01:07:25,638
Thanks, Mahi.

1025
01:07:26,581 --> 01:07:30,483
l know film stars get paid a lot
to attend events like this one.

1026
01:07:30,885 --> 01:07:32,682
But you're doing this only for your mother.

1027
01:07:33,388 --> 01:07:34,446
l am really grateful to you.

1028
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:36,718
Any time, Pratap uncle.

1029
01:07:37,025 --> 01:07:39,755
Let me know if l can ever help in any way.

1030
01:07:39,828 --> 01:07:40,453
Thanks.

1031
01:07:44,632 --> 01:07:46,691
Actually, l'd like a small favor.

1032
01:07:47,001 --> 01:07:47,933
Of course.

1033
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,931
There's this actress, Rhea Mehra.

1034
01:07:55,009 --> 01:07:58,376
She has forged her age in her passport.

1035
01:07:59,314 --> 01:08:02,977
l think, if you could alert the authorities...

1036
01:08:03,385 --> 01:08:05,876
Yes, no problem. l will do that.

1037
01:08:11,626 --> 01:08:12,991
Shinde, hand me the passport.

1038
01:08:15,597 --> 01:08:16,586
What's the matter, officer?

1039
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,933
Madam, you have to come with us.

1040
01:08:20,368 --> 01:08:21,494
But what's the problem?

1041
01:08:21,569 --> 01:08:23,764
We need to question you.
Get her.

1042
01:08:24,806 --> 01:08:25,636
Please come.

1043
01:08:27,375 --> 01:08:29,309
The breaking news at the moment.

1044
01:08:29,778 --> 01:08:34,010
Airport immigration authorities
have detained actress Rhea Mehra...

1045
01:08:34,282 --> 01:08:36,978
for forging her age in her passport.

1046
01:08:37,352 --> 01:08:40,879
Rhea Mehra was on her way to Paris
with her friends to celebrate her birthday.

1047
01:08:40,955 --> 01:08:47,417
Sources tell us that until the enquiry is through,
Rhea Mehra can't travel overseas.

1048
01:08:47,495 --> 01:08:51,522
We tried contacting her,
but could not get through.

1049
01:08:52,801 --> 01:08:53,426
Nice?

1050
01:08:53,501 --> 01:08:54,331
Very nice.

1051
01:08:54,402 --> 01:08:55,334
l think it's perfect.

1052
01:08:55,403 --> 01:08:56,961
- What do you think?
- lt's beautiful.

1053
01:08:57,038 --> 01:08:58,266
l am very happy.

1054
01:08:58,339 --> 01:08:59,897
You are looking beautiful.

1055
01:09:00,341 --> 01:09:03,538
Why don't you try the other
three outfits too, please.

1056
01:09:04,245 --> 01:09:05,735
But that commercial is after 10 days.

1057
01:09:06,414 --> 01:09:06,812
lt's fine.

1058
01:09:06,881 --> 01:09:09,941
l know but l want to finish the alteration soon.

1059
01:09:10,351 --> 01:09:13,650
Thanks to Rhea's passport controversy...

1060
01:09:13,922 --> 01:09:15,651
Gayatri is doing Abbas' next film.

1061
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:17,390
And that diva!

1062
01:09:17,792 --> 01:09:19,783
She won't wear any of Rhea's outfits.

1063
01:09:20,361 --> 01:09:22,329
She has changed the entire look.

1064
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:24,222
Two weeks before the shoot!

1065
01:09:24,299 --> 01:09:26,426
Just imagine, l am so harrowed...

1066
01:09:29,504 --> 01:09:31,597
Mahi, what's wrong?

1067
01:09:33,942 --> 01:09:34,499
What?

1068
01:09:34,576 --> 01:09:36,567
l don't know, l was just wondering...

1069
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:39,340
Does Abbas have a problem with me?

1070
01:09:40,315 --> 01:09:41,942
Even l wanted that role.

1071
01:09:44,552 --> 01:09:46,713
l sent Abbas a long text...

1072
01:09:47,422 --> 01:09:48,582
but he didn't reply.

1073
01:09:49,491 --> 01:09:50,014
Weird!

1074
01:09:50,892 --> 01:09:52,951
Michelle, excuse us for a minute, please.

1075
01:09:53,027 --> 01:09:53,425
Sure.

1076
01:09:53,862 --> 01:09:54,419
Thank you.

1077
01:09:55,797 --> 01:09:58,527
A text to Abbas? Are you crazy?

1078
01:09:59,434 --> 01:10:02,562
Abbas cannot reply to any heroine's text.

1079
01:10:03,037 --> 01:10:05,403
lf he does, his wife Zara will kill him.

1080
01:10:05,807 --> 01:10:06,501
Yeah!

1081
01:10:06,841 --> 01:10:10,675
After his affair with Christina,
Zara gave him an ultimatum.

1082
01:10:11,346 --> 01:10:14,474
lf he does any hanky-panky with any heroine...

1083
01:10:14,916 --> 01:10:15,974
he will be a dead man.

1084
01:10:16,784 --> 01:10:20,982
ln fact, Zara handles the casting of
heroines for Abbas' films.

1085
01:10:21,589 --> 01:10:23,580
She chose Gayatri.

1086
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:25,448
See, it's just between you and me.

1087
01:10:25,627 --> 01:10:26,525
Don't say it was me.

1088
01:10:26,728 --> 01:10:28,787
Just telling you as a friend,
okay?

1089
01:10:29,797 --> 01:10:30,764
Let's try other outfits.

1090
01:10:30,832 --> 01:10:31,457
Come on...

1091
01:10:31,799 --> 01:10:32,766
Michelle..

1092
01:10:50,818 --> 01:10:52,547
This is your third cigarette.

1093
01:10:53,488 --> 01:10:54,978
Why are you so tense?

1094
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,021
What's wrong?

1095
01:11:01,529 --> 01:11:02,359
Nothing.

1096
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:14,599
What's the matter, my dear?

1097
01:11:16,678 --> 01:11:17,872
Work stress, Angad.

1098
01:11:19,314 --> 01:11:21,407
My career is going downhill.

1099
01:11:21,482 --> 01:11:22,642
What nonsense!

1100
01:11:24,586 --> 01:11:26,417
Film offers are pouring in.

1101
01:11:26,487 --> 01:11:27,681
You're doing commercials.

1102
01:11:28,356 --> 01:11:31,723
Media is writing about us.
What else do you want?

1103
01:11:33,895 --> 01:11:36,921
The films offered are not interesting.

1104
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:40,299
Commercials don't really help.

1105
01:11:41,369 --> 01:11:42,495
You will be fine.

1106
01:11:50,078 --> 01:11:52,911
Angad, l never do this but...

1107
01:11:53,781 --> 01:11:55,908
l'm comfortable with you and
so l'm saying this.

1108
01:11:58,453 --> 01:11:59,784
Please talk to Zara for me.

1109
01:12:02,256 --> 01:12:03,814
Abbas is doing Nikhil Anand's film.

1110
01:12:04,926 --> 01:12:08,362
lf Zara's recommends,
Abbas won't refuse.

1111
01:12:10,565 --> 01:12:11,827
But Mahi...

1112
01:12:13,434 --> 01:12:16,835
l've never discussed
Abbas' professional life with Zara.

1113
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:20,264
lt's a bit weird, you know.

1114
01:12:21,376 --> 01:12:21,842
l know.

1115
01:12:23,845 --> 01:12:25,710
But l believe l am perfect for this role.

1116
01:12:27,048 --> 01:12:31,610
Abbas has signed Gayatri and
you know how she is.

1117
01:12:37,325 --> 01:12:38,314
Anyway, forget it.

1118
01:12:40,361 --> 01:12:41,658
l don't want to force you.

1119
01:12:44,766 --> 01:12:46,290
What's the worst that could happen?

1120
01:12:47,435 --> 01:12:48,663
My career will be over.

1121
01:12:50,905 --> 01:12:53,305
And l'll end up buying a cricket team
with some businessman!

1122
01:12:55,476 --> 01:12:56,067
What else?

1123
01:13:07,889 --> 01:13:08,787
Zara...

1124
01:13:08,956 --> 01:13:10,924
You know Abbas and l know Gayatri.

1125
01:13:11,859 --> 01:13:12,985
She is a slut.

1126
01:13:13,528 --> 01:13:15,325
You know about outdoor shoots.

1127
01:13:15,797 --> 01:13:17,025
Abbas' affair with Christina?

1128
01:13:17,632 --> 01:13:19,623
You plan on going back to your mother again?

1129
01:13:20,301 --> 01:13:22,360
Angad, all actresses are like that.

1130
01:13:22,737 --> 01:13:24,364
Who can you trust?

1131
01:13:24,572 --> 01:13:26,699
l mean, we need an actress.

1132
01:13:27,575 --> 01:13:30,043
There is one safe option,
Mahi.

1133
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:34,341
Abbas knows she is seeing me,
he will be careful.

1134
01:13:35,383 --> 01:13:38,910
With all due respect,
Mahi is no saint either.

1135
01:13:39,854 --> 01:13:43,290
l've heard and seen a lot about her.

1136
01:13:43,458 --> 01:13:46,291
But now she is with me.

1137
01:13:47,061 --> 01:13:49,689
You know l am serious about her.

1138
01:13:51,365 --> 01:13:52,332
Otherwise l wouldn't be here.

1139
01:13:53,034 --> 01:13:56,595
Angad, don't you like anyone
apart from actresses?

1140
01:13:57,004 --> 01:13:59,802
The others aren't as beautiful.

1141
01:14:00,775 --> 01:14:03,608
Please talk to Abbas about Mahi.

1142
01:14:04,612 --> 01:14:06,239
For me, please!

1143
01:14:08,249 --> 01:14:09,648
Please talk to Abbas.

1144
01:14:10,384 --> 01:14:11,942
For me, please!

1145
01:14:13,521 --> 01:14:15,682
Head and Shoulders
Shampoo and Conditioner.

1146
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:20,318
Cut please!

1147
01:14:21,662 --> 01:14:23,789
We are done with this shot.
Thank you!

1148
01:14:23,865 --> 01:14:25,765
Okay, so l'll wait in the van.

1149
01:14:25,967 --> 01:14:27,559
Go for your next change.

1150
01:14:27,635 --> 01:14:28,465
Your call.

1151
01:14:30,938 --> 01:14:31,870
Hi...

1152
01:14:35,443 --> 01:14:36,307
You are joking!

1153
01:14:38,446 --> 01:14:38,810
Thank you.

1154
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:40,569
Thank you so much.

1155
01:14:41,783 --> 01:14:42,408
Yeah!

1156
01:14:42,717 --> 01:14:43,911
l will see you in the evening.

1157
01:14:44,585 --> 01:14:45,017
Bye.

1158
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:13,907
Hi Pallavi... Angad called.

1159
01:15:15,016 --> 01:15:16,608
l have some breaking news.

1160
01:15:17,685 --> 01:15:21,644
l'm Abbas Khan's heroine in
Nikhil Anand's next film.

1161
01:15:23,024 --> 01:15:23,888
Spread the word!

1162
01:16:29,909 --> 01:16:30,398
Angad, is it?

1163
01:16:32,311 --> 01:16:32,800
No.

1164
01:16:35,381 --> 01:16:36,973
You know something,
Nikhil is a slave driver.

1165
01:16:37,483 --> 01:16:39,041
He's made us work for
seven days straight.

1166
01:16:40,086 --> 01:16:42,077
l mean, it's an outdoor shoot,
and not even a day's break.

1167
01:16:43,089 --> 01:16:44,078
Totally exhausted.

1168
01:16:46,259 --> 01:16:47,453
Anyway, l'm calling for an
early pack-up today.

1169
01:16:49,362 --> 01:16:50,158
Need to relax.

1170
01:16:50,997 --> 01:16:52,089
l want a glass of red wine.

1171
01:16:54,233 --> 01:16:57,100
Hey... you like red wine, right?

1172
01:16:59,038 --> 01:16:59,868
Yeah.

1173
01:17:01,774 --> 01:17:04,174
ln fact,
some fan here gave me this bottle of a...

1174
01:17:04,243 --> 01:17:06,336
50 year old Chateau Margaux.

1175
01:17:07,079 --> 01:17:07,909
Wow.

1176
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:09,174
l would hate to have it alone.

1177
01:17:10,216 --> 01:17:11,410
Why don't you come over to my room.

1178
01:17:12,351 --> 01:17:13,113
We'll have it together.

1179
01:17:18,257 --> 01:17:18,882
What's wrong?

1180
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:22,750
You see...

1181
01:17:25,031 --> 01:17:26,430
l'm on antibiotics.

1182
01:17:27,366 --> 01:17:28,924
So, l can't drink wine.

1183
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:31,764
For how long?

1184
01:17:33,973 --> 01:17:34,735
About three days.

1185
01:17:35,374 --> 01:17:36,136
That's not a problem.

1186
01:17:37,243 --> 01:17:39,507
Today is Tuesday, we'll have it on Friday.

1187
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:43,346
l'll tell Nikhil to give the crew
a day off on Saturday.

1188
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:46,851
So that we will have
all the time on Friday night.

1189
01:17:48,387 --> 01:17:49,149
Good idea.

1190
01:18:00,066 --> 01:18:00,828
Coming...

1191
01:18:07,206 --> 01:18:07,695
Hey!

1192
01:18:08,374 --> 01:18:08,897
Hi.

1193
01:18:11,844 --> 01:18:12,401
Looking gorgeous.

1194
01:18:13,446 --> 01:18:14,276
Thank you.

1195
01:18:15,047 --> 01:18:15,445
Come in.

1196
01:18:16,082 --> 01:18:16,946
Surprise!

1197
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:18,112
What's up, man!

1198
01:18:19,385 --> 01:18:20,283
What do you think?

1199
01:18:22,088 --> 01:18:24,113
Mahi got this idea to surprise you.

1200
01:18:25,258 --> 01:18:26,190
Fantastic!

1201
01:18:27,426 --> 01:18:28,324
Come...

1202
01:18:32,498 --> 01:18:33,260
Hey.

1203
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,758
l have to say, Abbas.

1204
01:18:35,835 --> 01:18:38,804
Of all your heroines,
Mahi is my favorite.

1205
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:41,206
Yes l agree.

1206
01:18:42,475 --> 01:18:45,376
From now, Mahi is my favorite too.

1207
01:18:46,913 --> 01:18:47,811
- Come...
- Yeah!

1208
01:18:48,814 --> 01:18:50,873
So what are you love birds upto?

1209
01:18:51,751 --> 01:18:52,718
Red wine, Mahi?

1210
01:18:54,453 --> 01:18:55,317
Sure.

1211
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,074
Nice, very nice.

1212
01:19:22,348 --> 01:19:25,909
Abbas, getting Gayatri to do an item number
was a fab idea.

1213
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:28,184
l know.

1214
01:19:29,889 --> 01:19:31,151
The first trailer should feature only this song.

1215
01:19:32,391 --> 01:19:34,120
ln fact, the publicity for the film should...

1216
01:19:34,193 --> 01:19:35,217
only focus on this item number.

1217
01:19:36,963 --> 01:19:39,397
Also, get a poster featuring only Gayatri.

1218
01:19:41,133 --> 01:19:42,293
Solo poster?

1219
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,860
But Mahi is the heroine.

1220
01:19:46,706 --> 01:19:47,195
And the hero?

1221
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:52,901
This film is on my shoulders.

1222
01:19:52,979 --> 01:19:53,809
Mahi is yours.

1223
01:19:55,147 --> 01:19:56,114
Deal with it.

1224
01:20:48,067 --> 01:20:50,695
Wow!
You were fantastic, baby!

1225
01:20:50,770 --> 01:20:52,203
Thanks, dear!

1226
01:20:53,105 --> 01:20:55,767
- You are a genius, Abbas.
- Great job!

1227
01:20:55,841 --> 01:20:56,808
You did it man.

1228
01:20:57,043 --> 01:20:57,907
Thanks brother.

1229
01:20:58,177 --> 01:21:01,738
Hey... That was amazing,
l am so proud of you.

1230
01:21:02,014 --> 01:21:03,276
You look hot!

1231
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:07,441
Great!
Abbas just rocked again.

1232
01:21:07,686 --> 01:21:08,345
Outstanding!

1233
01:21:19,865 --> 01:21:23,426
Thank you.

1234
01:21:24,203 --> 01:21:25,170
- Congrats, sir.
- Thank you.

1235
01:21:25,237 --> 01:21:28,229
50 million weekend opening! l'd predicted this.

1236
01:21:28,307 --> 01:21:29,865
Thank you!

1237
01:21:30,109 --> 01:21:33,772
Sir, mark my words,
your film will touch 1.5 billion, at least!

1238
01:21:33,946 --> 01:21:35,345
You suggested Mahi for our film.

1239
01:21:36,315 --> 01:21:38,943
She hardly had eight scenes and
she didn't even act well.

1240
01:21:39,018 --> 01:21:40,781
Alex, she looks lovely.

1241
01:21:40,853 --> 01:21:41,478
Oh come on!

1242
01:21:42,021 --> 01:21:43,147
We need an actress.

1243
01:21:43,355 --> 01:21:46,722
Not some... decoration. Mahi is out.

1244
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:50,219
Congratulations, Abbas.
You did it.

1245
01:21:50,963 --> 01:21:53,329
No, Mahi, we did it.

1246
01:21:57,136 --> 01:21:59,696
Gayatri... Lucky mascot of my film.

1247
01:21:59,772 --> 01:22:00,864
Come... come.

1248
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:01,770
There you are.

1249
01:22:03,309 --> 01:22:05,709
l'm glad you agreed to do this item song.

1250
01:22:05,778 --> 01:22:06,210
Thanks!

1251
01:22:08,314 --> 01:22:09,406
And you really rock,
you know that?

1252
01:22:09,682 --> 01:22:11,707
Come on Abbas!
Anything for you.

1253
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:14,882
What is it, Mahi?

1254
01:22:15,254 --> 01:22:16,448
lt's not fair, Nikhil.

1255
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:19,157
l'm barely visible in the film.

1256
01:22:19,825 --> 01:22:22,350
Mahi, you know Abbas.

1257
01:22:23,028 --> 01:22:25,895
Once the shoot is over,
right from editing to publicity design...

1258
01:22:25,965 --> 01:22:27,330
Abbas controls everything.

1259
01:22:28,033 --> 01:22:29,796
He cut me out of the editing too.

1260
01:22:30,236 --> 01:22:32,101
You know what, Mahi, cheer up.

1261
01:22:32,905 --> 01:22:34,964
Look around... at the public reaction.

1262
01:22:35,274 --> 01:22:39,404
The trade guys are predicting
a 1.5 billion business!

1263
01:22:39,845 --> 01:22:42,814
And, in our industry, only hits matter.

1264
01:22:43,315 --> 01:22:44,942
That's the success mantra, right?

1265
01:22:45,751 --> 01:22:48,720
Mahi, you were brilliant.
Absolutely mind blowing

1266
01:22:48,787 --> 01:22:49,082
Thank you!

1267
01:22:49,255 --> 01:22:51,746
Announce a sequel.
lt has to rock.

1268
01:22:52,057 --> 01:22:56,858
Nikhil, Gayatri's item number
was a killer.

1269
01:22:57,029 --> 01:22:57,688
Thanks.

1270
01:23:00,399 --> 01:23:01,730
- Congratulations bro.
- Thanks bro!

1271
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,427
Second half was mind blowing,
this film will make 1 billion.

1272
01:23:17,783 --> 01:23:21,048
Mahi looks upset.
Her role was reduced to nothing.

1273
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,111
lt's obvious.

1274
01:23:23,822 --> 01:23:25,915
She pissed off Abbas, Aryan...

1275
01:23:26,926 --> 01:23:28,416
if she does this to every hero...

1276
01:23:29,261 --> 01:23:31,752
she will end up
a thumbnail on the posters.

1277
01:23:36,468 --> 01:23:37,366
Mahi.

1278
01:23:39,305 --> 01:23:39,828
Let's go.

1279
01:23:42,775 --> 01:23:43,867
Calm down, Mahi.

1280
01:23:43,943 --> 01:23:45,035
What do you mean, calm down?

1281
01:23:45,411 --> 01:23:47,106
Not one good review.

1282
01:23:47,746 --> 01:23:50,772
The critics are saying, 'Abbas Khan is the star
and Mahi is just a showpiece'!

1283
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:52,942
My role was chopped off!

1284
01:23:53,886 --> 01:23:57,014
The film is a super hit,
and that's all that matters.

1285
01:23:57,423 --> 01:23:59,687
You've got three calls
for endorsements!

1286
01:23:59,758 --> 01:24:01,385
You've been offered two major films.

1287
01:24:06,832 --> 01:24:07,423
Pallavi...
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1288
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:12,930
am l a good actress?
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1289
01:24:13,906 --> 01:24:14,736
Come on, Mahi.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1290
01:24:15,107 --> 01:24:16,438
Answer the damn question.

1291
01:24:21,347 --> 01:24:23,042
Am l a good actress?
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1292
01:24:25,084 --> 01:24:25,743
Or not?
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1293
01:24:26,285 --> 01:24:27,252
Mahi, you are a star.

1294
01:24:27,953 --> 01:24:29,682
You don't need to be an actress.

1295
01:24:30,789 --> 01:24:31,414
l do.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1296
01:24:33,292 --> 01:24:34,350
l do, indeed.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1297
01:24:42,768 --> 01:24:43,700
Mahi Arora.

1298
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:49,739
You're a big star.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1299
01:24:50,643 --> 01:24:52,338
Why do you want to do
a Tapan Guha film?

1300
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,973
You know l'm
an eccentric film maker.

1301
01:24:58,717 --> 01:25:02,118
My next film, Tarranum Jaan,
is about a prostitute.

1302
01:25:03,022 --> 01:25:04,216
lt has sex...
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1303
01:25:04,256 --> 01:25:05,245
abusive language.

1304
01:25:06,992 --> 01:25:08,823
l make realistic films...

1305
01:25:09,361 --> 01:25:11,386
while you're a commercial heroine.

1306
01:25:13,132 --> 01:25:14,656
l work on a small budget.

1307
01:25:16,035 --> 01:25:19,232
And stars like you have
a thousand issues.

1308
01:25:20,439 --> 01:25:22,373
l promise, Tapanda,
that won't happen.

1309
01:25:25,144 --> 01:25:28,045
Listen, this is my
first Hindi language film.

1310
01:25:29,715 --> 01:25:32,343
You won't have free dates...
your price is a problem.

1311
01:25:33,919 --> 01:25:35,443
l have a start-to-finish schedule.

1312
01:25:37,389 --> 01:25:40,119
You can't take up
any other work for six months.

1313
01:25:41,994 --> 01:25:42,892
What say?

1314
01:25:50,736 --> 01:25:52,897
You decide the dates
and the price.

1315
01:25:55,708 --> 01:25:56,402
When do we start?

1316
01:26:00,746 --> 01:26:01,405
Keep it properly.

1317
01:26:12,024 --> 01:26:13,491
Dada, how's it going?

1318
01:26:13,859 --> 01:26:16,487
The traffic in Mumbai...

1319
01:26:16,762 --> 01:26:18,423
Ma'am, sit.

1320
01:26:19,331 --> 01:26:21,356
Hi!
l am Promita.

1321
01:26:21,967 --> 01:26:23,332
Of course, Promita Roy.

1322
01:26:24,269 --> 01:26:25,236
Oh, please sit.

1323
01:26:26,905 --> 01:26:27,496
You know, Mahi...

1324
01:26:27,773 --> 01:26:29,035
l am so glad you're doing this film.

1325
01:26:29,274 --> 01:26:32,869
lt's a kickass script and
your role is superb.

1326
01:26:33,379 --> 01:26:36,940
l know but l'm not sure
if l can do this.

1327
01:26:37,383 --> 01:26:39,180
- Why?
- lt's the first time l'm doing such a film and...

1328
01:26:40,219 --> 01:26:42,153
l haven't won as many awards as you.

1329
01:26:42,755 --> 01:26:43,278
Please!

1330
01:26:44,156 --> 01:26:46,317
l don't take these
awards and critics seriously.

1331
01:26:46,825 --> 01:26:48,816
Perhaps that's why they take me seriously.

1332
01:26:49,862 --> 01:26:50,920
You know, Mahi...

1333
01:26:50,996 --> 01:26:53,089
this film will transform
your glamorous image.

1334
01:26:54,099 --> 01:26:56,363
l'm a regular fixture in dada's films.

1335
01:26:56,935 --> 01:26:58,129
l've done four films with him...

1336
01:26:58,737 --> 01:27:00,034
and that's why l'm in this too.

1337
01:27:00,439 --> 01:27:01,770
What's that term...

1338
01:27:02,274 --> 01:27:03,241
Special appearance!

1339
01:27:04,376 --> 01:27:05,343
Alok, get me a cigarette.

1340
01:27:07,246 --> 01:27:08,235
Mahi...

1341
01:27:10,916 --> 01:27:15,285
Don't smoke in public
or this isn't your brand?

1342
01:27:20,826 --> 01:27:21,155
Let's go over the lines.

1343
01:27:23,128 --> 01:27:24,493
Promita, lt is not just lines...

1344
01:27:24,763 --> 01:27:26,458
concentrate on your acting.

1345
01:27:29,768 --> 01:27:31,099
Hey, you please switch off your phone.

1346
01:27:31,770 --> 01:27:32,896
Concentrate on your scene.

1347
01:27:33,071 --> 01:27:34,902
Do you remember your last line?

1348
01:27:37,176 --> 01:27:38,507
We will be zooming in.

1349
01:27:47,853 --> 01:27:48,945
No, i don't want.

1350
01:27:52,291 --> 01:27:53,849
Cut! Cut it!

1351
01:27:56,395 --> 01:27:58,761
Mahi, feel the complexity of the emotions...

1352
01:27:58,797 --> 01:27:59,821
Please lie down.

1353
01:28:00,466 --> 01:28:02,366
Listen, l am the customer
who is looking at you.

1354
01:28:05,404 --> 01:28:06,302
Mahi...

1355
01:28:06,371 --> 01:28:07,065
Yes, dada.

1356
01:28:09,208 --> 01:28:11,369
Now we will shoot scene 20.

1357
01:28:13,045 --> 01:28:14,444
This is a four-page scene.

1358
01:28:15,414 --> 01:28:19,282
We will shoot one shot,
one scene, no cut.

1359
01:28:19,751 --> 01:28:22,185
You have to memorize all your lines...

1360
01:28:22,254 --> 01:28:23,312
and you have one hour.

1361
01:28:23,889 --> 01:28:25,083
Here, get started.

1362
01:28:25,858 --> 01:28:27,052
But... one hour?

1363
01:28:28,727 --> 01:28:30,752
This is how small budget films are.

1364
01:28:31,330 --> 01:28:33,924
Cut down on the BBM
and concentrate on your work.

1365
01:28:44,710 --> 01:28:45,074
Hi!

1366
01:28:47,212 --> 01:28:49,680
Hi! When did you arrive?

1367
01:28:50,148 --> 01:28:51,172
That's a cold reaction.

1368
01:28:52,417 --> 01:28:54,282
l thought you'd be happy to see me.

1369
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:56,180
Of course, l am.

1370
01:28:56,922 --> 01:29:01,291
lt's just that l'm drained
and l've a four-page scene.

1371
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,284
Excuses!

1372
01:29:04,997 --> 01:29:07,056
l called you, l sent texts...

1373
01:29:07,466 --> 01:29:08,433
you didn't answer.

1374
01:29:10,202 --> 01:29:13,729
This isn't a match
to keep score of the calls.

1375
01:29:15,107 --> 01:29:15,869
Oh please!

1376
01:29:16,408 --> 01:29:20,071
Look, this is an intense film.

1377
01:29:21,013 --> 01:29:23,311
l have to concentrate on
my performance every day!

1378
01:29:25,083 --> 01:29:25,879
You're lucky.

1379
01:29:28,253 --> 01:29:31,780
lf l don't talk to you,
l can't concentrate on my performance.

1380
01:29:32,491 --> 01:29:34,083
That's why l keep calling you.

1381
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:36,191
All season l was...

1382
01:29:42,334 --> 01:29:42,925
l am sorry.

1383
01:29:45,237 --> 01:29:46,033
l forgive you!

1384
01:29:48,407 --> 01:29:49,237
Surprise!

1385
01:29:55,147 --> 01:29:58,014
We've been dating for a year.
lt's time to get married.

1386
01:29:59,117 --> 01:30:02,109
My family is also happy for us.

1387
01:30:05,857 --> 01:30:06,221
Angad...

1388
01:30:07,859 --> 01:30:10,726
l don't know what to say...

1389
01:30:11,063 --> 01:30:12,121
Say, 'yes'!

1390
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:19,460
Look, l really appreciate it...

1391
01:30:20,839 --> 01:30:22,966
but right now, l'm just not in
the frame of mind.

1392
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:25,469
l need some time.

1393
01:30:29,448 --> 01:30:30,881
Of course, baby.

1394
01:30:36,455 --> 01:30:38,047
You can take all the time you want.

1395
01:30:39,358 --> 01:30:41,258
But say yes, my dear.

1396
01:30:50,836 --> 01:30:53,964
What are you saying?
Don't tell me what to do.

1397
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:58,699
One day no budget forjunior artist,
the next day, cut down on shoot days.

1398
01:30:59,044 --> 01:31:00,375
And you expect me to make a film?

1399
01:31:01,113 --> 01:31:02,944
l've made five films!

1400
01:31:03,015 --> 01:31:04,744
And four have won the National award.

1401
01:31:05,450 --> 01:31:09,011
l know this is my first Hindi feature film,
but do not take me for granted.

1402
01:31:09,755 --> 01:31:13,122
l've seen the rubbish you've
made with big stars.

1403
01:31:13,759 --> 01:31:15,192
Tell your bosses...

1404
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:18,696
they can't make a film sitting in
the comfort of an AC room.

1405
01:31:19,197 --> 01:31:22,064
l sweat and toil to make a film.

1406
01:31:22,134 --> 01:31:23,362
l know that, dada...

1407
01:31:23,435 --> 01:31:24,993
Do not disturb me on the set like this.

1408
01:31:25,337 --> 01:31:26,201
Dada, listen...

1409
01:31:26,271 --> 01:31:27,465
Let me concentrate, please!

1410
01:31:28,306 --> 01:31:28,931
Now what?

1411
01:31:28,974 --> 01:31:30,407
l'll sort this, don't worry!

1412
01:31:31,009 --> 01:31:31,976
Partho!

1413
01:31:33,945 --> 01:31:34,240
Action!

1414
01:31:34,713 --> 01:31:36,340
You slut!
You're stealing my customer.

1415
01:31:36,415 --> 01:31:39,816
Hey! l don't need to steal.
He chose me.

1416
01:31:40,352 --> 01:31:41,341
You're lying.

1417
01:31:42,187 --> 01:31:43,745
This is the third customer you've taken.

1418
01:31:44,022 --> 01:31:46,752
Stop doing that or
l'll smash your face so bad...

1419
01:31:46,825 --> 01:31:48,087
you'll look scary in the dark too.

1420
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:49,955
Cut it!

1421
01:31:51,863 --> 01:31:53,091
What is wrong, Mahi?

1422
01:31:53,398 --> 01:31:55,332
You sound like a machine.

1423
01:31:56,835 --> 01:31:57,961
Feel the character.

1424
01:31:59,137 --> 01:32:01,298
You are not Mahi, the heroine...

1425
01:32:02,074 --> 01:32:04,804
here you are my character,
Tarranum, the prostitute.

1426
01:32:05,177 --> 01:32:07,737
Feel the character.

1427
01:32:08,146 --> 01:32:11,946
This kind of acting is fine for Bollywood,
not for my cinema.

1428
01:32:12,284 --> 01:32:14,309
Make her more real.

1429
01:32:14,386 --> 01:32:14,943
Realism.

1430
01:32:16,688 --> 01:32:17,245
You bloody idiot!

1431
01:32:17,789 --> 01:32:18,312
Give me that phone.

1432
01:32:20,258 --> 01:32:23,352
Get out, go and kneel down.

1433
01:32:27,733 --> 01:32:28,256
Where was l...

1434
01:32:31,069 --> 01:32:32,696
No, can't happen like this.

1435
01:32:32,771 --> 01:32:33,965
Pack up!

1436
01:32:46,418 --> 01:32:47,783
Just relax, Mahi.

1437
01:32:51,089 --> 01:32:52,818
The thing with dada is...

1438
01:32:53,258 --> 01:32:54,657
he wants realism in everything.

1439
01:32:55,927 --> 01:32:59,727
And he feels you can't portray that realism.

1440
01:33:00,732 --> 01:33:02,427
But, relax, it will come.

1441
01:33:03,335 --> 01:33:07,203
l don't know what dada wants me to do.

1442
01:33:11,143 --> 01:33:11,905
l know.

1443
01:33:12,878 --> 01:33:13,867
Get dressed and come with me.

1444
01:33:14,312 --> 01:33:15,301
Come on! Get ready.

1445
01:33:17,783 --> 01:33:20,149
A lot of foreigners come here.

1446
01:33:20,218 --> 01:33:22,083
l mean, what do you call that
oh yes, documentary.

1447
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:25,014
- Come here, handsome!
- Don't worry about anything.

1448
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:26,682
Come.. come..

1449
01:33:27,259 --> 01:33:28,817
Don't worry about anything.

1450
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:30,327
Promita, what place is this?

1451
01:33:30,395 --> 01:33:31,362
l am scared.

1452
01:33:31,429 --> 01:33:32,259
Don't be scared.

1453
01:33:32,464 --> 01:33:33,897
Just get in.

1454
01:33:47,746 --> 01:33:50,146
Aren't you...
the 'Halkat Jawani' girl?

1455
01:33:50,215 --> 01:33:52,843
Yes!
Mahi Arora.

1456
01:33:53,251 --> 01:33:57,813
l mean...
you are a fabulous dancer.

1457
01:33:58,824 --> 01:33:59,688
Can l get you some tea?

1458
01:34:00,859 --> 01:34:02,417
No, thanks, madam.

1459
01:34:02,694 --> 01:34:04,127
We are here to observe you.

1460
01:34:04,663 --> 01:34:06,654
We are shooting for a film.

1461
01:34:06,731 --> 01:34:08,892
And we're playing characters, just like you.

1462
01:34:08,967 --> 01:34:10,229
Really?

1463
01:34:10,302 --> 01:34:12,270
So you are here to study our mannerisms.

1464
01:34:12,337 --> 01:34:19,334
How these girls live, eat, abuse...

1465
01:34:19,778 --> 01:34:21,268
how they go about their profession.

1466
01:34:22,414 --> 01:34:23,403
All of you, listen to me.

1467
01:34:23,982 --> 01:34:25,677
These heroines here...

1468
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:29,117
are saying that they will play our part.

1469
01:34:30,021 --> 01:34:31,784
lf you take up ourjob...

1470
01:34:32,157 --> 01:34:33,749
what will we do?

1471
01:34:34,759 --> 01:34:36,727
Well said, Hamida bai.

1472
01:34:36,761 --> 01:34:37,420
Well said!

1473
01:34:39,865 --> 01:34:41,025
Anyway
you can watch us all you want.

1474
01:34:41,433 --> 01:34:43,162
We are open for business.

1475
01:34:43,235 --> 01:34:44,702
Another thing...

1476
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:46,135
we won't charge you to watch us...

1477
01:34:46,204 --> 01:34:48,172
unlike your movies.

1478
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:50,231
- Don't you agree?
- Yes, madam.

1479
01:34:50,642 --> 01:34:53,941
Go on, you can talk to the girls here.

1480
01:34:54,012 --> 01:34:55,639
- Valli bhai...
- Yes, madam?

1481
01:34:55,714 --> 01:34:58,148
- Why don't you call for some kebabs?
- Absolutely!

1482
01:34:58,216 --> 01:35:00,081
Get it from Habib's counter.

1483
01:35:19,237 --> 01:35:19,931
Hamida bai...

1484
01:35:20,005 --> 01:35:22,166
the police are all over the place.

1485
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:24,037
This way, quick.

1486
01:35:25,744 --> 01:35:27,439
l will lead you out through the back door.

1487
01:35:27,712 --> 01:35:29,976
Hurry up!
Let them out through the other exit.

1488
01:35:30,715 --> 01:35:34,082
This way.
Quick!

1489
01:35:43,094 --> 01:35:46,222
So, how was the research?
Wasn't it exciting?

1490
01:35:46,464 --> 01:35:48,022
Research?

1491
01:35:48,099 --> 01:35:49,828
Promita, you are crazy!

1492
01:35:50,302 --> 01:35:52,964
Being crazy is part of the excitement.

1493
01:35:54,306 --> 01:35:55,466
lt was an adventure.

1494
01:35:56,274 --> 01:35:57,400
That's what makes us better actors.

1495
01:35:58,376 --> 01:36:00,071
You need to relax, Mahi.

1496
01:36:05,116 --> 01:36:06,174
l need a drink.

1497
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:11,445
Come on, let's go to my place.

1498
01:36:48,893 --> 01:36:49,291
You know...

1499
01:36:50,161 --> 01:36:52,686
you are a good actress, Mahi.

1500
01:36:55,467 --> 01:36:59,767
The pain that's within you is what
you need to express on screen.

1501
01:36:59,804 --> 01:37:02,170
Then you'll be miles ahead of everyone.

1502
01:37:05,910 --> 01:37:06,467
Never mind.

1503
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:09,938
How many boyfriends have you had?

1504
01:37:10,415 --> 01:37:15,284
Don't look so shocked.
l'm sure you keep a count.

1505
01:37:18,289 --> 01:37:20,052
l've had 17.

1506
01:37:20,992 --> 01:37:23,051
The serious ones!

1507
01:37:27,766 --> 01:37:30,428
Don't worry, l don't want an answer.

1508
01:37:50,188 --> 01:37:50,984
You are beautiful.

1509
01:38:23,988 --> 01:38:24,977
By 4 take 2.

1510
01:38:25,056 --> 01:38:26,114
Action!

1511
01:38:27,792 --> 01:38:29,384
l told that jerk.

1512
01:38:29,461 --> 01:38:31,895
'You want it,
you do it here'.

1513
01:38:31,963 --> 01:38:34,864
'l'm not coming to some cheap hotel'.

1514
01:38:36,101 --> 01:38:37,193
Cut it!

1515
01:38:37,802 --> 01:38:38,268
Very good.

1516
01:38:38,503 --> 01:38:40,061
That was good.
Very good.

1517
01:38:40,138 --> 01:38:41,969
Mahi, very good. Very nice.

1518
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:44,037
What's the next shot?

1519
01:39:03,261 --> 01:39:04,193
By 2 Take 1!

1520
01:39:06,431 --> 01:39:07,864
That was nothing!

1521
01:39:07,899 --> 01:39:09,833
Now, listen to this.

1522
01:39:10,702 --> 01:39:12,329
A slut has four admirers.

1523
01:39:13,104 --> 01:39:15,834
One in the north, one in the east...

1524
01:39:15,907 --> 01:39:18,933
one in the west and
another in the south!

1525
01:39:19,010 --> 01:39:21,001
lmpressive, Tarranum Jaan.

1526
01:39:21,146 --> 01:39:22,170
Cut it!

1527
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:23,139
Don't hit me.

1528
01:39:23,214 --> 01:39:24,203
Bloody theif!

1529
01:39:24,282 --> 01:39:27,080
- This is wrong.
- Get out!

1530
01:39:27,418 --> 01:39:28,407
Slimy jerk!

1531
01:39:28,786 --> 01:39:29,980
How dare you don't pay!

1532
01:39:32,991 --> 01:39:34,151
Cut it! Okay!

1533
01:39:34,225 --> 01:39:35,123
Very nice shot, Mahi.

1534
01:39:35,193 --> 01:39:35,818
Very good.

1535
01:39:36,361 --> 01:39:37,453
Very nice, Mahi.

1536
01:39:38,196 --> 01:39:40,164
- Very nice, isn't it?
- Absolutely!

1537
01:39:42,901 --> 01:39:44,095
Give me the script.

1538
01:39:52,143 --> 01:39:55,909
Mahi, please listen to me.

1539
01:39:58,917 --> 01:40:01,784
What happened that night, it was nothing.

1540
01:40:04,189 --> 01:40:05,315
lt was just a moment.

1541
01:40:07,859 --> 01:40:10,123
For God sake, l'm not a lesbian.

1542
01:40:16,334 --> 01:40:17,130
Anyway...

1543
01:40:17,735 --> 01:40:19,464
my special appearance...

1544
01:40:20,004 --> 01:40:20,971
today was the last of it.

1545
01:40:22,073 --> 01:40:23,131
l'm going back to Kolkata.

1546
01:40:23,875 --> 01:40:25,308
lt was great working with you.

1547
01:40:29,981 --> 01:40:32,381
l am sorry that we couldn't be friends.

1548
01:40:35,853 --> 01:40:38,185
l wish you all the best, take care.

1549
01:40:42,026 --> 01:40:42,720
Promita...

1550
01:40:46,231 --> 01:40:47,129
you take care.

1551
01:40:50,335 --> 01:40:51,097
Thanks.

1552
01:41:00,778 --> 01:41:01,403
Mom, stop it.

1553
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:06,377
We had fun this weekend.
l shouldn't have come to drop you.

1554
01:41:07,118 --> 01:41:09,211
Mahi, getting irritated won't help.

1555
01:41:09,787 --> 01:41:11,084
You know l am saying the truth.

1556
01:41:11,389 --> 01:41:14,187
You know it's not easy
taking such decisions.

1557
01:41:14,392 --> 01:41:15,859
Why not?

1558
01:41:16,261 --> 01:41:19,321
You always complained that
Aryan wasn't ready to commit.

1559
01:41:20,198 --> 01:41:22,462
Now when Angad wants to marry you...

1560
01:41:22,734 --> 01:41:23,758
what's the problem?

1561
01:41:23,835 --> 01:41:24,767
Don't you love him?

1562
01:41:25,303 --> 01:41:26,702
Of course, l love him.

1563
01:41:27,472 --> 01:41:30,066
But right now,
l want to concentrate on my career.

1564
01:41:31,075 --> 01:41:32,235
He also has his career.

1565
01:41:33,177 --> 01:41:34,701
What's the rush?

1566
01:41:36,281 --> 01:41:37,111
Mahi...

1567
01:41:38,383 --> 01:41:41,978
whether you marry Angad or not,
is your decision.

1568
01:41:42,887 --> 01:41:45,048
But let me make this clear.

1569
01:41:45,256 --> 01:41:47,952
Tell Angad what's in your heart.

1570
01:41:47,992 --> 01:41:49,186
Don't keep him hanging.

1571
01:41:49,394 --> 01:41:51,988
Don't do to him what Aryan did to you.

1572
01:41:52,664 --> 01:41:53,426
Get it?

1573
01:42:03,374 --> 01:42:04,363
l knew it!

1574
01:42:04,942 --> 01:42:07,240
Everybody told me that you won't marry me.

1575
01:42:07,312 --> 01:42:08,779
l didn't want to accept.

1576
01:42:10,148 --> 01:42:11,877
Try to understand.

1577
01:42:12,283 --> 01:42:14,274
l'm not saying l don't want to marry you.

1578
01:42:14,886 --> 01:42:17,320
All l'm saying is right now we need to
give time to our careers.

1579
01:42:18,122 --> 01:42:19,282
What's the rush?

1580
01:42:22,327 --> 01:42:24,727
You wasted a whole year with that excuse!

1581
01:42:25,997 --> 01:42:27,191
How much more time do you want?

1582
01:42:28,399 --> 01:42:30,993
lt's all nonsense.
Just excuses!

1583
01:42:32,003 --> 01:42:35,097
When you heroines have love,
you chase a career...

1584
01:42:35,173 --> 01:42:36,435
when you make it big, you want love!

1585
01:42:36,908 --> 01:42:38,136
You greedy women!

1586
01:42:39,110 --> 01:42:42,079
lt's not that your career will end
if you were to marry me!

1587
01:42:42,914 --> 01:42:43,938
l was ajerk!

1588
01:42:44,882 --> 01:42:45,746
Angad!

1589
01:42:45,817 --> 01:42:47,648
l thought you were different.

1590
01:42:48,820 --> 01:42:53,416
l thought you weren't happy,
l wanted to rescue you...

1591
01:42:57,929 --> 01:42:59,726
l loved you, Mahi.

1592
01:43:00,031 --> 01:43:01,089
Angad, please!

1593
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,697
Enough is enough!

1594
01:43:05,103 --> 01:43:06,764
l can't do this anymore.

1595
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:11,806
Actresses like you can't love someone.

1596
01:43:12,744 --> 01:43:14,405
You can only act as if you do.

1597
01:43:15,847 --> 01:43:16,814
Please, relax.

1598
01:43:16,881 --> 01:43:19,042
You only know how to use others.

1599
01:43:21,753 --> 01:43:23,050
l don't want you anymore!

1600
01:43:27,058 --> 01:43:28,389
l don't want you anymore!

1601
01:44:05,863 --> 01:44:06,420
Hello...

1602
01:44:10,101 --> 01:44:10,795
What?!

1603
01:44:10,935 --> 01:44:12,903
Tapanda, you can't do this.

1604
01:44:13,204 --> 01:44:14,296
How can you shelve this film?

1605
01:44:14,372 --> 01:44:15,236
You can't shelve this film.

1606
01:44:15,373 --> 01:44:16,431
l can do anything l want.

1607
01:44:16,974 --> 01:44:18,202
Bloody corporate film makers!

1608
01:44:18,709 --> 01:44:21,405
They're trying to teach a National award
winning director to make a film!

1609
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:24,807
Sometimes they say the film is serious,
sometimes they want humor.

1610
01:44:24,882 --> 01:44:26,372
They want to add an item number...

1611
01:44:26,717 --> 01:44:28,844
Bloody no aesthetic sense!
Teaching me to make a film!

1612
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:30,854
l will talk to them. l'll sort everything.

1613
01:44:30,922 --> 01:44:33,220
No, it won't help.

1614
01:44:33,958 --> 01:44:36,085
l've decided l'm not making this film.

1615
01:44:37,395 --> 01:44:37,827
But...

1616
01:44:38,262 --> 01:44:40,321
how can we shelve this film now?.

1617
01:44:41,098 --> 01:44:43,032
Because of this film...

1618
01:44:43,801 --> 01:44:45,735
l sacrificed all other work!

1619
01:44:46,070 --> 01:44:47,935
Now you're walking away from it!

1620
01:44:49,373 --> 01:44:50,032
Mahi!

1621
01:44:50,408 --> 01:44:51,204
Tapanda, please!

1622
01:44:52,910 --> 01:44:54,275
l have lost all patience.

1623
01:44:55,379 --> 01:44:57,779
l know you've put in a lot of effort for this film.

1624
01:44:57,849 --> 01:45:00,977
l know you've sacrificed a lot,
but everything is not lost.

1625
01:45:01,886 --> 01:45:04,150
This experience will...

1626
01:45:04,388 --> 01:45:06,015
make you a better actress.

1627
01:45:06,290 --> 01:45:07,314
Tapanda, please!

1628
01:45:07,725 --> 01:45:09,090
That's when you'll thank me.

1629
01:45:12,263 --> 01:45:12,957
Bless you.

1630
01:45:13,030 --> 01:45:14,895
Tapanda...

1631
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:38,411
Gracy, just get out.

1632
01:45:38,756 --> 01:45:40,087
Pull the blinds.

1633
01:45:41,692 --> 01:45:42,852
Just go!

1634
01:45:45,863 --> 01:45:46,693
They say...

1635
01:45:46,764 --> 01:45:50,825
to make good friends,
you have to be one yourself.

1636
01:45:50,902 --> 01:45:54,736
Unfortunately film stars can't think of anyone
but themselves.

1637
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:58,031
lf Mahi had a true friend...

1638
01:45:58,442 --> 01:46:00,467
she wouldn't have been so scared...

1639
01:46:00,745 --> 01:46:02,076
wouldn't have made so many mistakes.

1640
01:46:03,114 --> 01:46:05,480
Tarranum Jaan was a big mistake.

1641
01:46:06,250 --> 01:46:08,184
And Mahi resorted to punishing herself.

1642
01:46:08,853 --> 01:46:09,376
She was ruined.

1643
01:46:10,721 --> 01:46:13,417
Her rivals and newcomers
replaced her.

1644
01:46:14,058 --> 01:46:19,428
Shagufta Rizvi was the only person
with whom Mahi felt at peace.

1645
01:46:20,197 --> 01:46:23,792
When l met her during that time,
l wrote...

1646
01:46:23,935 --> 01:46:26,062
that Mahi had brought
this upon herself.

1647
01:46:27,004 --> 01:46:28,869
lt didn't matter
whose fault it was...

1648
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:31,398
it still hurt.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1649
01:46:32,243 --> 01:46:33,210
Poor Mahi.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1650
01:46:33,945 --> 01:46:37,108
The things she did to get rid of her pain.

1651
01:46:38,149 --> 01:46:39,275
So, what have you decided?

1652
01:46:40,017 --> 01:46:41,985
We've heard that you
are seeing a psychiatrist.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1653
01:46:43,387 --> 01:46:48,347
You have also mentioned that
you drink regularly.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1654
01:46:50,761 --> 01:46:51,455
So...

1655
01:46:52,363 --> 01:46:57,266
Having scrutinized your family background
and your professional life...

1656
01:46:57,335 --> 01:46:59,963
the adoption panel has concluded that...

1657
01:47:00,237 --> 01:47:02,762
you are incapable of being a single parent.

1658
01:47:07,044 --> 01:47:08,272
lncapable?

1659
01:47:10,047 --> 01:47:13,278
What do you mean?
How did they decide?

1660
01:47:14,151 --> 01:47:18,281
Have they ever seen me... met me?

1661
01:47:19,357 --> 01:47:22,758
Some forms tell you
l am not capable?!

1662
01:47:23,861 --> 01:47:24,759
Tell me, sister.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1663
01:47:24,962 --> 01:47:25,951
Tell me.

1664
01:47:26,297 --> 01:47:26,854
Mahi...
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1665
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:33,767
To become a good parent,
you need patience and emotional control.

1666
01:47:35,206 --> 01:47:37,766
Qualities which you clearly don't have.

1667
01:47:38,809 --> 01:47:40,777
Practice for a few more years...

1668
01:47:41,879 --> 01:47:42,868
and apply again.

1669
01:47:43,214 --> 01:47:43,873
Good day.

1670
01:47:45,416 --> 01:47:47,907
Sister, you can't do this.

1671
01:47:48,152 --> 01:47:49,881
Sister, you can't do this.

1672
01:47:49,954 --> 01:47:50,750
This is wrong.

1673
01:47:51,122 --> 01:47:52,054
l will sue you.

1674
01:47:52,089 --> 01:47:53,113
Do you understand?!

1675
01:47:54,425 --> 01:47:56,450
Yes, l take psychiatric help...

1676
01:47:56,961 --> 01:47:58,724
Yes l drink, so what?

1677
01:47:58,796 --> 01:47:59,854
Let's go...

1678
01:47:59,964 --> 01:48:00,453
come on!

1679
01:48:00,731 --> 01:48:03,222
So what?
l'm not fit to be a mother?

1680
01:48:03,434 --> 01:48:05,299
Let's go...

1681
01:48:06,871 --> 01:48:07,803
l will sue you!

1682
01:48:13,344 --> 01:48:14,333
Hi Mahi.

1683
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:17,310
What is this, Pallavi?

1684
01:48:18,449 --> 01:48:19,848
You should be happy.

1685
01:48:20,151 --> 01:48:22,984
So what if you couldn't adopt,
at least you are on the front page.

1686
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:25,811
You need to pay
to get such coverage.

1687
01:48:26,824 --> 01:48:28,189
What nonsense!

1688
01:48:28,793 --> 01:48:30,488
How could you release
this story without my consent?

1689
01:48:31,195 --> 01:48:32,423
Excuse me?

1690
01:48:33,097 --> 01:48:34,928
Since when do l need your consent?

1691
01:48:36,333 --> 01:48:37,391
You've forgotten the time...

1692
01:48:37,868 --> 01:48:40,496
when l made you sneeze into a storm?

1693
01:48:41,272 --> 01:48:43,365
You didn't object then...
there was no problem.

1694
01:48:46,010 --> 01:48:47,910
Because this is my personal life.

1695
01:48:50,881 --> 01:48:51,779
Wake up, Mahi!

1696
01:48:52,349 --> 01:48:56,046
ln this industry, there's no difference between your
professional and personal life.

1697
01:48:56,821 --> 01:48:57,412
Your life...

1698
01:48:57,822 --> 01:48:58,914
is public property.

1699
01:48:59,190 --> 01:49:01,317
l used it to plan your comeback.

1700
01:49:02,026 --> 01:49:03,994
And now you've ruined it.

1701
01:49:05,763 --> 01:49:08,823
Thanks to my PR skills,
you still make headlines...

1702
01:49:08,899 --> 01:49:11,891
and that makes you interesting.

1703
01:49:12,737 --> 01:49:13,931
What else do you have?

1704
01:49:15,072 --> 01:49:17,336
No films, no relationships...

1705
01:49:18,075 --> 01:49:20,100
actually, nothing!

1706
01:49:25,015 --> 01:49:25,811
Get out!

1707
01:49:27,017 --> 01:49:28,177
Right now!

1708
01:49:28,986 --> 01:49:29,918
You are fired.

1709
01:49:31,388 --> 01:49:33,288
And don't ever show me your bloody face.

1710
01:49:34,091 --> 01:49:34,989
Get out!

1711
01:49:42,733 --> 01:49:43,791
Can't face the truth, can you?

1712
01:49:44,869 --> 01:49:46,131
Someone has rightly said...

1713
01:49:47,037 --> 01:49:50,336
There are people and
then there are actors.

1714
01:49:59,316 --> 01:50:02,308
Mukesh, Mahi has given you
two super hits.

1715
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:04,285
One with Rohan.

1716
01:50:05,256 --> 01:50:08,191
She deserves to do another film
with you. Please.

1717
01:50:08,359 --> 01:50:10,122
Rashid bhai, you know very well that...

1718
01:50:10,194 --> 01:50:12,890
things in the film industry change every Friday.

1719
01:50:13,798 --> 01:50:16,232
Mahi's last hit was with Abbas.

1720
01:50:16,934 --> 01:50:18,367
And that was a year ago.

1721
01:50:19,069 --> 01:50:21,264
Moreover she's not on good terms
with the heroes.

1722
01:50:21,705 --> 01:50:24,105
Not just me, no hero
would want to work with her.

1723
01:50:24,375 --> 01:50:28,072
Not to forget that crazy phase...

1724
01:50:28,946 --> 01:50:31,312
that film on prostitutes...

1725
01:50:31,982 --> 01:50:33,074
Tarranum Jaan!

1726
01:50:33,484 --> 01:50:34,382
She wasted nine months.

1727
01:50:34,451 --> 01:50:35,145
Nine months!

1728
01:50:36,020 --> 01:50:37,954
ln these nine months so many
fresh faces have been launched.

1729
01:50:38,422 --> 01:50:40,481
The industry waits for no one.

1730
01:50:41,826 --> 01:50:44,886
Mahi is neither professional,
nor a box office success.

1731
01:50:45,696 --> 01:50:47,288
l have a suggestion.

1732
01:50:47,698 --> 01:50:49,757
Tell Mahi to do a reality series.

1733
01:50:50,201 --> 01:50:52,362
Or marry a rich NRl.

1734
01:50:54,171 --> 01:50:55,297
Mukesh, look at this...

1735
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:57,908
South of France.

1736
01:50:57,975 --> 01:50:58,839
Mind blowing.

1737
01:50:58,909 --> 01:50:59,307
Superb, isn't it?

1738
01:50:59,376 --> 01:51:01,003
Great job, fantastic.

1739
01:51:03,247 --> 01:51:04,805
Alright, Mukesh. See you.

1740
01:51:15,259 --> 01:51:16,021
Mahi...

1741
01:51:17,828 --> 01:51:22,288
the lifespan of a heroine is
quite short in our industry.

1742
01:51:24,101 --> 01:51:28,731
lf you sit here doing nothing,
you'll lose that too.

1743
01:51:31,141 --> 01:51:32,870
What can l do, Rashid bhai?

1744
01:51:33,944 --> 01:51:35,104
Nobody is giving me any work.

1745
01:51:35,913 --> 01:51:40,179
There's a good script,
it's a small budget film.

1746
01:51:40,251 --> 01:51:42,219
The director and producer are new.

1747
01:51:43,687 --> 01:51:44,415
What's that term...

1748
01:51:45,122 --> 01:51:46,885
New wave cinema.

1749
01:51:49,894 --> 01:51:52,294
Shall l fix a meeting?

1750
01:52:00,237 --> 01:52:02,398
There's also an offer
to make an appearance.

1751
01:52:05,676 --> 01:52:08,270
At the wedding of an industrialist's daughter...

1752
01:52:09,213 --> 01:52:12,011
you'll be the bride's friend.

1753
01:52:13,117 --> 01:52:15,312
The money is good.

1754
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:17,751
What do you say?

1755
01:52:32,870 --> 01:52:33,996
Ladies and gentlemen...

1756
01:52:34,371 --> 01:52:35,463
Here is your seat ma'am.

1757
01:52:36,073 --> 01:52:36,937
Alright!

1758
01:52:37,141 --> 01:52:39,041
Here is your boarding pass.

1759
01:52:39,109 --> 01:52:40,098
Thank you.

1760
01:52:41,211 --> 01:52:42,109
l'll get it for you.

1761
01:52:42,179 --> 01:52:43,111
Thank you.

1762
01:55:04,021 --> 01:55:04,385
Hi...

1763
01:55:08,659 --> 01:55:09,648
Won't you invite me in?

1764
01:55:14,765 --> 01:55:15,424
You look beautiful.

1765
01:55:19,236 --> 01:55:22,672
l know, l have hurt you a lot.

1766
01:55:24,942 --> 01:55:26,671
l often thought about talking to you.

1767
01:55:28,879 --> 01:55:29,846
But l just couldn't.

1768
01:55:31,315 --> 01:55:33,078
Then l saw you on the flight and...

1769
01:55:35,352 --> 01:55:36,785
l realized how much l missed you.

1770
01:55:42,159 --> 01:55:43,319
We were so happy.

1771
01:55:44,895 --> 01:55:45,884
What do you want, Aryan?

1772
01:55:48,065 --> 01:55:49,054
l love you, Mahi.

1773
01:55:54,037 --> 01:55:56,801
After we broke up, l realized that...

1774
01:55:59,877 --> 01:56:00,809
l know what you're thinking.

1775
01:56:02,312 --> 01:56:04,405
After we broke up, l had three affairs.

1776
01:56:06,116 --> 01:56:07,845
You know what...

1777
01:56:10,120 --> 01:56:11,109
l...

1778
01:56:11,188 --> 01:56:13,179
l kept comparing them to you.

1779
01:56:15,492 --> 01:56:16,959
And l was disappointed.

1780
01:56:21,198 --> 01:56:22,722
They were just not like us.

1781
01:56:24,968 --> 01:56:26,230
l really love you, Mahi.

1782
01:56:27,304 --> 01:56:28,828
Why?

1783
01:56:31,909 --> 01:56:32,500
Why now?.

1784
01:56:33,177 --> 01:56:36,943
Because no one ever loved me like you did.

1785
01:56:44,021 --> 01:56:45,215
l know...

1786
01:56:45,289 --> 01:56:47,348
l know all of this seems sudden.

1787
01:56:48,425 --> 01:56:49,357
But, really... think about it.

1788
01:56:50,827 --> 01:56:51,885
We were really good together.

1789
01:57:05,709 --> 01:57:07,108
Please, come on.

1790
01:57:10,247 --> 01:57:12,181
l would've done the same if l were you.

1791
01:57:15,852 --> 01:57:17,251
So, l guess this is it then.

1792
01:57:19,423 --> 01:57:21,152
You are precious, Mahi.

1793
01:57:22,726 --> 01:57:23,192
Take care.

1794
01:57:24,962 --> 01:57:25,428
Aryan.

1795
01:57:39,743 --> 01:57:41,040
l am so sorry...

1796
01:57:42,179 --> 01:57:43,339
l am so sorry.

1797
01:57:46,316 --> 01:57:47,283
l am so sorry.

1798
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:55,225
ln the battle between the heart and the mind,
the heart has always won.

1799
01:57:55,926 --> 01:57:58,986
ln any case, Mahi never followed her mind.

1800
01:58:00,163 --> 01:58:02,097
Mahi and Aryan patched up...

1801
01:58:02,199 --> 01:58:07,000
and her career restarted
with a small budget film, 'Annie'.

1802
01:58:07,070 --> 01:58:11,166
Aryan was serious about her,
but Mahi was not sure.

1803
01:58:11,241 --> 01:58:14,108
The wounds of her past were still fresh and...

1804
01:58:14,144 --> 01:58:17,341
she found accepting this difficult.

1805
01:58:17,414 --> 01:58:21,043
Though Mahi was living with Aryan,
she wasn't with him.

1806
01:58:27,224 --> 01:58:29,089
Having a rough day, Mahi?

1807
01:58:29,426 --> 01:58:30,450
Not at all.

1808
01:58:32,195 --> 01:58:34,186
l've noticed you don't seem happy...

1809
01:58:34,264 --> 01:58:35,060
not as much as you should.

1810
01:58:37,067 --> 01:58:37,999
Mahi...

1811
01:58:39,069 --> 01:58:40,730
How will l know if you don't tell me?

1812
01:58:42,439 --> 01:58:44,100
l don't know...

1813
01:58:45,809 --> 01:58:47,743
There's this fear that...

1814
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:51,680
if l'm too happy...

1815
01:58:52,783 --> 01:58:54,182
all this will end.

1816
01:58:56,887 --> 01:58:58,081
The past...

1817
01:58:59,222 --> 01:59:00,917
keeps haunting me.

1818
01:59:04,861 --> 01:59:06,260
Listen, Mahi...

1819
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:12,031
things need time to heal.

1820
01:59:12,903 --> 01:59:14,302
We need to give some time...

1821
01:59:14,705 --> 01:59:17,731
to our relationship, to each other.

1822
01:59:19,242 --> 01:59:22,143
for things to be normal.

1823
01:59:25,749 --> 01:59:26,238
l think l have a plan.

1824
01:59:28,919 --> 01:59:30,147
Let's do a film together.

1825
01:59:32,422 --> 01:59:34,117
A big budget period film.

1826
01:59:35,092 --> 01:59:36,218
Alex and l are producing it.

1827
01:59:38,995 --> 01:59:41,725
On that pretext...
we will be together.

1828
01:59:42,733 --> 01:59:44,826
That will be our comeback.

1829
01:59:46,403 --> 01:59:47,870
What do you think?

1830
01:59:48,405 --> 01:59:50,168
l think we will have a blast.

1831
01:59:57,214 --> 01:59:59,808
Please, Andy, don't tell anyone about this film.

1832
02:00:00,083 --> 02:00:02,711
Aryan hasn't made it official yet.

1833
02:00:02,786 --> 02:00:07,951
lt is a period film and l want you to
research the costumes thoroughly!

1834
02:00:09,092 --> 02:00:10,923
Anyway, Andy, we'll talk later.

1835
02:00:11,194 --> 02:00:13,094
Yeah!
See you later.

1836
02:00:13,363 --> 02:00:13,829
Hello ma'am.

1837
02:00:13,897 --> 02:00:14,864
Please sit.

1838
02:00:14,931 --> 02:00:15,363
Thank you.

1839
02:00:17,033 --> 02:00:22,335
Mr. Nair, Annie is due for release in two weeks
but there's no publicity.

1840
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:24,004
There's no buzz.

1841
02:00:25,375 --> 02:00:29,106
The promos are aired a few times
but not on all channels.

1842
02:00:29,146 --> 02:00:29,908
How will that help?

1843
02:00:30,347 --> 02:00:31,336
What can l say.

1844
02:00:31,415 --> 02:00:36,375
We had allocated 30 million for the publicity but
you had the climax reshot.

1845
02:00:37,053 --> 02:00:39,419
The publicity funds were used for that.

1846
02:00:39,489 --> 02:00:41,923
But the new climax has improved the film.

1847
02:00:43,393 --> 02:00:45,418
Anyway, now we have to be aggressive.

1848
02:00:46,930 --> 02:00:48,864
Get a new PR company.

1849
02:00:48,932 --> 02:00:50,058
Radio, TV...

1850
02:00:50,133 --> 02:00:51,862
the publicity of Annie should be all over.

1851
02:00:53,003 --> 02:00:54,368
This film...
has to be a hit!

1852
02:00:54,938 --> 02:00:56,200
Definitely. We will try our best.

1853
02:00:56,973 --> 02:00:57,871
We have to!

1854
02:00:58,975 --> 02:01:03,139
We're investing 1.5 billion for this film.
lt's already a very risky project.

1855
02:01:04,014 --> 02:01:05,879
We can't afford to increase
the risk by signing Mahi.

1856
02:01:05,949 --> 02:01:06,916
She is over, Aryan.

1857
02:01:08,218 --> 02:01:08,877
What?

1858
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:10,818
l am sorry.

1859
02:01:11,121 --> 02:01:11,985
l didn't mean that.

1860
02:01:14,891 --> 02:01:17,223
But our company is new.
This is our first film.

1861
02:01:18,028 --> 02:01:19,188
We need a blockbuster.

1862
02:01:19,996 --> 02:01:21,122
Everything should be new.

1863
02:01:21,198 --> 02:01:23,189
Music, casting, locations, everything!

1864
02:01:23,266 --> 02:01:25,097
The audience has seen you and Mahi.

1865
02:01:25,735 --> 02:01:26,759
And they love us.

1866
02:01:26,837 --> 02:01:27,360
They used to.

1867
02:01:29,039 --> 02:01:29,903
Come on!

1868
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:33,073
The audience always wants
a new lead pair.

1869
02:01:33,710 --> 02:01:35,234
l spoke with the distributors.

1870
02:01:35,479 --> 02:01:37,913
They will buy into it if we sign Shaheen Khan.

1871
02:01:38,982 --> 02:01:40,006
She has had two super hit films.

1872
02:01:40,083 --> 02:01:41,311
She is the star of the moment.

1873
02:01:42,219 --> 02:01:43,083
And she has got dates.

1874
02:01:45,188 --> 02:01:46,052
You discussed this with her?

1875
02:01:46,723 --> 02:01:47,246
Relax.

1876
02:01:48,291 --> 02:01:50,987
l sort of talked to her secretary.

1877
02:01:55,999 --> 02:01:58,934
Alex, l've promised this film to Mahi.

1878
02:02:01,371 --> 02:02:02,770
And l am really serious about it.

1879
02:02:03,974 --> 02:02:07,842
Yes, l can see that.
No wonder you're getting emotional.

1880
02:02:10,213 --> 02:02:11,305
But, please Aryan...

1881
02:02:11,882 --> 02:02:14,817
l'd suggest you keep your
professional and personal life separate.

1882
02:02:15,285 --> 02:02:16,013
Don't mix them.

1883
02:02:17,220 --> 02:02:20,383
Besides, l'm not saying
you shouldn't work with Mahi.

1884
02:02:21,091 --> 02:02:22,718
We will adjust her in our next film.

1885
02:02:23,727 --> 02:02:25,319
She is not right for this film.

1886
02:02:25,729 --> 02:02:26,423
Look at the budget.

1887
02:02:27,097 --> 02:02:27,995
Just think about it.

1888
02:02:30,433 --> 02:02:31,798
Very less corwd.

1889
02:02:32,202 --> 02:02:32,725
What will we say?

1890
02:02:33,770 --> 02:02:34,930
l couldn't help it.

1891
02:02:35,071 --> 02:02:36,902
There are two major events,
so they've gone there.

1892
02:02:37,474 --> 02:02:39,840
They promised they'll show up...
let's see.

1893
02:02:40,443 --> 02:02:42,001
You should've changed
the press conference dates.

1894
02:02:42,712 --> 02:02:44,304
This doesn't make sense.

1895
02:02:45,815 --> 02:02:46,747
Sorry, Mahi.

1896
02:02:49,185 --> 02:02:49,981
Shall we start.

1897
02:02:51,187 --> 02:02:54,987
Mahi, are you marrying Aryan?

1898
02:02:55,659 --> 02:02:58,287
Does that mean, you will retire?

1899
02:03:00,230 --> 02:03:02,130
We are here to talk about 'Annie'.

1900
02:03:03,033 --> 02:03:04,091
Let's concentrate on this.

1901
02:03:04,901 --> 02:03:06,801
No personal questions, please...

1902
02:03:07,871 --> 02:03:11,671
l request you to stick
to professional questions.

1903
02:03:11,975 --> 02:03:13,101
You are right, Mahi.

1904
02:03:13,710 --> 02:03:16,201
So, let's talk about your professional life.

1905
02:03:16,413 --> 02:03:18,904
So answer this professional question...

1906
02:03:19,249 --> 02:03:23,151
There are rumors that you had signed
Aryan's home production...

1907
02:03:23,787 --> 02:03:26,085
and now you've been replaced by Shaheen.

1908
02:03:26,756 --> 02:03:30,283
ls this because you are
not the star you once were?

1909
02:03:31,161 --> 02:03:32,185
Your response?

1910
02:03:32,896 --> 02:03:34,989
Actually, you journalists should write film scripts.

1911
02:03:35,899 --> 02:03:39,357
The stories you create to get back!

1912
02:03:41,871 --> 02:03:44,339
lf a heroine buys a car, its a gift from a businessman.

1913
02:03:44,841 --> 02:03:47,002
lf she buys a diamond, she is engaged.

1914
02:03:47,711 --> 02:03:49,406
lf she goes to a hospital, she's getting an abortion.

1915
02:03:49,679 --> 02:03:51,146
lf she visits LA, it's for plastic surgery.

1916
02:03:52,248 --> 02:03:55,649
God forbid if she goes to Dubai...
you create a rate card for her!

1917
02:03:57,053 --> 02:03:58,918
People should learn to make stories from you!

1918
02:03:59,155 --> 02:04:00,884
You are digressing.

1919
02:04:01,224 --> 02:04:03,419
You still haven't answered my question.

1920
02:04:03,994 --> 02:04:07,361
You do know you're no longer part of
Aryan's home production, don't you?

1921
02:04:08,798 --> 02:04:09,822
That is not true.

1922
02:04:11,434 --> 02:04:13,026
l am the heroine in Aryan's film.

1923
02:04:15,872 --> 02:04:17,100
There's your answer!

1924
02:04:21,144 --> 02:04:22,907
Any questions about Annie?

1925
02:04:24,981 --> 02:04:25,970
Any question?

1926
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:31,243
l guess not.

1927
02:04:32,055 --> 02:04:33,147
So, let's wrap this up.

1928
02:04:33,790 --> 02:04:34,814
Mahi...

1929
02:04:35,225 --> 02:04:36,692
Mahi please...

1930
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:38,284
What attitude!
She has gone mad.

1931
02:04:38,361 --> 02:04:39,828
What nonsense is this.

1932
02:04:42,899 --> 02:04:43,228
Yes, Rats?

1933
02:04:43,366 --> 02:04:46,358
Mahi, l've been calling you...
why didn't you answer?

1934
02:04:46,636 --> 02:04:47,625
l was at the press conference.

1935
02:04:48,338 --> 02:04:49,862
That's precisely why l wanted to talk to you.

1936
02:04:50,073 --> 02:04:53,941
Everybody is saying that Shaheen has replaced you.

1937
02:04:54,010 --> 02:04:54,704
l know.

1938
02:04:55,679 --> 02:04:56,805
Tamanna asked the same thing.

1939
02:04:57,080 --> 02:04:58,069
lt's true.

1940
02:04:58,281 --> 02:05:00,806
l just spoke to Shaheen's secretary.

1941
02:05:00,884 --> 02:05:02,317
They have even discussed the dates.

1942
02:05:02,886 --> 02:05:05,184
Shaheen is doing Aryan's film, not you!

1943
02:05:07,924 --> 02:05:08,913
l will talk to you later.

1944
02:05:16,366 --> 02:05:18,197
Do you want me to twist my ankle?

1945
02:05:18,268 --> 02:05:19,326
Come on Aryan.

1946
02:05:20,203 --> 02:05:21,227
Give us some easy steps.

1947
02:05:28,111 --> 02:05:29,043
We need to talk.

1948
02:05:32,816 --> 02:05:33,214
Now!

1949
02:05:35,151 --> 02:05:35,845
Just a minute.

1950
02:05:40,290 --> 02:05:41,018
You are lying, Aryan.

1951
02:05:41,791 --> 02:05:42,723
Did you talk to Alex?

1952
02:05:42,959 --> 02:05:44,722
No, l told you l didn't talk to Alex.

1953
02:05:45,028 --> 02:05:46,996
You didn't?

1954
02:05:47,764 --> 02:05:48,696
That means l am still doing your film?

1955
02:05:50,166 --> 02:05:51,133
Okay, listen...

1956
02:05:52,368 --> 02:05:53,392
l talked to him...

1957
02:05:53,470 --> 02:05:56,064
See! l knew it!

1958
02:05:56,139 --> 02:05:57,333
Baby, please listen to me.

1959
02:05:58,208 --> 02:06:01,177
l talked to him but we didn't decide.

1960
02:06:01,244 --> 02:06:03,041
He wanted to sign Shaheen.

1961
02:06:03,113 --> 02:06:05,240
And that got you excited!

1962
02:06:06,416 --> 02:06:07,940
Couldn't you tell him that l am doing this film?

1963
02:06:08,017 --> 02:06:09,382
You are still doing this film.

1964
02:06:10,253 --> 02:06:11,720
Let me talk to Alex.

1965
02:06:12,989 --> 02:06:15,184
Fine, talk. Do it now.

1966
02:06:15,391 --> 02:06:16,221
Relax, Mahi.

1967
02:06:16,993 --> 02:06:20,087
l will do that in my time.
Everything will be fine.

1968
02:06:20,830 --> 02:06:21,387
Liar!

1969
02:06:22,766 --> 02:06:24,461
You said the same thing when
you were with lsha.

1970
02:06:25,468 --> 02:06:27,493
l shouldn't have trusted you.

1971
02:06:27,771 --> 02:06:28,965
You are a cheat.

1972
02:06:29,038 --> 02:06:30,005
Liar!

1973
02:06:31,007 --> 02:06:32,133
Bloody b******!

1974
02:06:32,208 --> 02:06:33,038
Relax, Mahi!

1975
02:06:33,977 --> 02:06:35,774
lt's not as big as you're making it out to be.

1976
02:06:37,781 --> 02:06:39,043
Really?

1977
02:06:39,082 --> 02:06:41,983
Then why don't you say that
l am the heroine of your film?

1978
02:06:42,352 --> 02:06:45,788
Because l need to talk to Alex.
There are many other decisions.

1979
02:06:45,855 --> 02:06:47,914
After all the budget is 1.5 billion.

1980
02:06:48,291 --> 02:06:50,851
Relax, l'm telling you l will sort this out.

1981
02:06:51,294 --> 02:06:53,285
l'm not a star anymore...

1982
02:06:55,732 --> 02:06:56,994
that's why you're doing this.

1983
02:06:57,167 --> 02:06:58,896
Baby, that's not true.

1984
02:07:00,236 --> 02:07:02,170
Really, then tell me...

1985
02:07:04,340 --> 02:07:06,274
that l am the heroine of your film!

1986
02:07:06,342 --> 02:07:07,001
Mahi, listen.

1987
02:07:07,076 --> 02:07:07,804
Tell me now!

1988
02:07:09,879 --> 02:07:13,713
Am l the heroine of your film or not?

1989
02:07:14,851 --> 02:07:15,476
You are for me!

1990
02:07:16,853 --> 02:07:17,751
Wow!

1991
02:07:19,856 --> 02:07:21,323
What an answer!

1992
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:25,457
You care about no one!

1993
02:07:25,728 --> 02:07:26,717
Come on, Mahi!

1994
02:07:26,796 --> 02:07:31,165
l just knew it, you care about no one.

1995
02:07:48,218 --> 02:07:53,178
Alex, l told you l wasn't sure about Shaheen.

1996
02:07:53,957 --> 02:07:55,049
Then why is the media talking about it?

1997
02:07:55,925 --> 02:07:57,324
You know how the media is.

1998
02:07:57,927 --> 02:08:00,054
A mere mention
and they create headlines!

1999
02:08:00,964 --> 02:08:02,226
What nonsense!

2000
02:08:02,765 --> 02:08:04,460
No one apart from you knew about this.

2001
02:08:05,401 --> 02:08:08,996
Anyway, l can only do this film with Mahi.

2002
02:08:09,072 --> 02:08:11,199
Why are you getting so emotional about Mahi?

2003
02:08:11,407 --> 02:08:13,375
This is not an emotional decision.

2004
02:08:13,943 --> 02:08:16,309
Go through the script. Mahi is perfect for the part.

2005
02:08:16,946 --> 02:08:18,880
Either we do this film with Mahi.

2006
02:08:18,915 --> 02:08:19,711
Or we don't!

2007
02:08:20,350 --> 02:08:21,248
Okay?

2008
02:08:21,784 --> 02:08:23,376
Aryan...

2009
02:08:25,788 --> 02:08:27,016
Silly chap.

2010
02:08:29,225 --> 02:08:30,157
Ram...

2011
02:08:31,427 --> 02:08:32,485
Aryan Khanna's film is shelved.

2012
02:08:42,272 --> 02:08:42,829
Come on, Mahi...

2013
02:08:42,906 --> 02:08:43,804
pick up.

2014
02:08:49,045 --> 02:08:50,342
Come on, pick up...

2015
02:08:52,949 --> 02:08:54,382
- What's wrong, sir?
- Nothing.

2016
02:08:54,918 --> 02:08:55,942
Sir, your ticket to Delhi.

2017
02:08:55,985 --> 02:08:59,421
You have to go from here,
we're running late.

2018
02:08:59,689 --> 02:09:00,883
Just cancel this, please.

2019
02:09:00,924 --> 02:09:02,084
Sir, how can l cancel it?

2020
02:09:02,158 --> 02:09:03,785
People are expecting you.

2021
02:09:15,305 --> 02:09:16,795
How dare he...

2022
02:09:17,774 --> 02:09:20,368
Mahi is a star!

2023
02:09:22,478 --> 02:09:24,139
l will not spare him.

2024
02:09:27,917 --> 02:09:29,316
l'll show that b******.

2025
02:09:35,425 --> 02:09:36,756
l am not over.

2026
02:10:04,153 --> 02:10:04,949
Yes, Mahi?

2027
02:10:05,388 --> 02:10:06,412
Where are you?

2028
02:10:07,190 --> 02:10:08,282
l'm at home. What is it?

2029
02:10:09,092 --> 02:10:09,990
Come to my place.

2030
02:10:10,760 --> 02:10:11,192
Now?.

2031
02:10:12,862 --> 02:10:14,887
Yes, right now!
Please.

2032
02:10:15,264 --> 02:10:16,162
That's not possible.

2033
02:10:17,934 --> 02:10:19,993
Pallavi, l need you here,
right now.

2034
02:10:20,069 --> 02:10:21,195
Mahi, what's the matter?

2035
02:10:21,270 --> 02:10:22,737
l will tell you when you get here.

2036
02:10:22,805 --> 02:10:23,703
Come here now.

2037
02:10:23,773 --> 02:10:24,831
lt's too late...

2038
02:10:24,907 --> 02:10:25,396
l cannot come.

2039
02:10:25,808 --> 02:10:27,070
Forget the damn time!

2040
02:10:28,911 --> 02:10:31,072
Pallavi, come here.
Right now!

2041
02:10:31,914 --> 02:10:34,906
Alright, Mahi, calm down.

2042
02:10:34,984 --> 02:10:35,712
l'll be there.

2043
02:10:36,786 --> 02:10:38,117
That b****** Aryan!

2044
02:10:38,221 --> 02:10:40,155
He has signed Shaheen for his film.

2045
02:10:40,256 --> 02:10:42,281
Pallavi, you have to do something.

2046
02:10:42,358 --> 02:10:45,327
l need 'Annie' to be a hit.

2047
02:10:46,396 --> 02:10:48,796
This film has to work, professionally
and personally.

2048
02:10:48,865 --> 02:10:49,957
l am sorry, Mahi.

2049
02:10:50,833 --> 02:10:51,822
There's nothing l can do.

2050
02:10:52,902 --> 02:10:53,926
'Annie' will hit theatres in two days.

2051
02:10:54,837 --> 02:10:56,862
Even if you start a publicity campaign
and spend on marketing...

2052
02:10:56,939 --> 02:10:57,769
it won't help this film.

2053
02:10:57,840 --> 02:10:58,807
You have to do it.

2054
02:11:00,910 --> 02:11:04,073
Please Pallavi.
Please!

2055
02:11:04,247 --> 02:11:05,339
You are my only hope.

2056
02:11:06,015 --> 02:11:07,004
Think of a gimmick.

02:11:07,083 --> 02:11:07,879

2058
02:11:08,418 --> 02:11:10,215
'Annie' has to be a success.

2059
02:11:11,254 --> 02:11:13,279
At least on the day of release.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

2060
02:11:13,756 --> 02:11:16,190
'Annie' is a small budget film...

2061
02:11:16,259 --> 02:11:17,954
centered around a woman.

2062
02:11:18,027 --> 02:11:20,188
Only a controversy can get people
to watch this film...

2063
02:11:20,263 --> 02:11:21,753
but, we have nothing.

2064
02:11:21,998 --> 02:11:24,057
l don't care!

2065
02:11:25,368 --> 02:11:26,392
You can do it.

2066
02:11:26,469 --> 02:11:27,959
l know, only you can do it!

2067
02:11:28,037 --> 02:11:28,935
l know...

2068
02:11:29,172 --> 02:11:30,799
l know, you can do it.

2069
02:11:30,873 --> 02:11:31,931
Do something...

2070
02:11:32,008 --> 02:11:32,838
please!

2071
02:11:33,042 --> 02:11:34,475
What can we do...

2072
02:11:34,744 --> 02:11:36,837
What will help to sell the film?

2073
02:11:37,780 --> 02:11:41,045
You don't have anything to sell
the film on.

2074
02:11:52,228 --> 02:11:54,162
l have something.

2075
02:11:55,331 --> 02:11:57,231
l have...

2076
02:12:08,711 --> 02:12:09,735
Will this do?

2077
02:12:17,820 --> 02:12:19,048
Genius, Mahi.

2078
02:12:27,230 --> 02:12:27,821
Yes, Pallavi?

2079
02:12:28,097 --> 02:12:29,086
Mahi...

2080
02:12:29,765 --> 02:12:31,027
the tapes have been leaked.

2081
02:12:31,434 --> 02:12:33,994
Listen... don't answer any calls.

2082
02:12:34,237 --> 02:12:36,262
And, don't react at all.

2083
02:12:58,127 --> 02:12:58,855
Hello?

2084
02:13:03,099 --> 02:13:04,794
Why are you screaming?

2085
02:13:04,867 --> 02:13:05,697
What is it?

2086
02:13:10,106 --> 02:13:11,971
Bollywood woke up to a furore as...

2087
02:13:12,041 --> 02:13:16,876
Mahi Arora and Aryan Khanna's
tapes were leaked online.

2088
02:13:17,680 --> 02:13:19,079
This clip has surfaced one day before...

2089
02:13:19,148 --> 02:13:21,139
the release of Mahi's film.

2090
02:13:21,851 --> 02:13:25,048
We still don't know if this video is real or morphed.

2091
02:13:25,121 --> 02:13:27,282
Bollywood is silent.

2092
02:13:27,757 --> 02:13:30,282
We've tried to reach
many eminent personalities...

2093
02:13:30,359 --> 02:13:31,917
but no one is willing to comment.

2094
02:13:31,994 --> 02:13:34,428
Nearly every one is unreachable.

2095
02:13:34,697 --> 02:13:36,358
ls this a tactic against Mahi...

2096
02:13:36,399 --> 02:13:39,698
or a cheap publicity stunt?

2097
02:13:40,102 --> 02:13:42,036
Mahi Arora's career is down but...

2098
02:13:42,104 --> 02:13:44,334
l don't think any girl would
do that to herself.

2099
02:13:44,407 --> 02:13:46,705
l am sure someone has morphed the video.
There should be an enquiry.

2100
02:13:53,316 --> 02:13:54,715
Mahi is in shock right now...

2101
02:13:54,984 --> 02:13:57,282
and she can't give a statement.

2102
02:13:57,353 --> 02:13:58,843
The video is doctored.

2103
02:13:58,921 --> 02:14:00,320
l request the media...

2104
02:14:00,389 --> 02:14:02,380
not to give this video undue attention.

2105
02:14:02,692 --> 02:14:04,091
But if people think that Mahi...

2106
02:14:04,160 --> 02:14:06,651
has done this to publicize her film...

2107
02:14:06,729 --> 02:14:09,197
then l feel they have lost their mind.

2108
02:14:09,265 --> 02:14:09,924
Thank you.

2109
02:14:32,788 --> 02:14:34,779
This clip has surfaced one day...

2110
02:14:34,857 --> 02:14:36,347
before the release of Mahi's film.

2111
02:14:36,425 --> 02:14:37,949
ls this a tactic against Mahi...

2112
02:14:38,027 --> 02:14:40,291
or a cheap publicity stunt?

2113
02:14:53,709 --> 02:14:56,735
Down with Mahi...

2114
02:14:59,382 --> 02:15:00,349
Oh shit!

2115
02:15:23,706 --> 02:15:26,675
Ma'am, shall l set the table?

2116
02:15:27,209 --> 02:15:29,905
No, you can eat.

2117
02:15:30,313 --> 02:15:31,211
Okay, ma'am.

2118
02:15:51,300 --> 02:15:52,028
Yes, Pallavi?

2119
02:15:52,335 --> 02:15:55,168
Mahi... it's a bumper opening.

2120
02:15:55,404 --> 02:15:57,702
Both multiplexes and
single screens are rocking.

2121
02:15:58,741 --> 02:15:59,765
Really?

2122
02:15:59,942 --> 02:16:02,467
We have done it.

2123
02:16:02,845 --> 02:16:03,834
l will keep updating you.

2124
02:16:03,913 --> 02:16:04,937
Bye.

2125
02:16:08,384 --> 02:16:09,715
Based on the crowd behind me...

2126
02:16:09,785 --> 02:16:11,252
it is obvious that either Mahi's video...

2127
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:13,880
was a well orchestrated stunt or a fake.

2128
02:16:13,956 --> 02:16:14,888
Whatever it was...

2129
02:16:14,957 --> 02:16:17,016
it seems to be helping Mahi's film...

2130
02:16:17,093 --> 02:16:18,993
pull in the crowd.

2131
02:16:27,169 --> 02:16:28,500
The Mahi Arora CD controversy...

2132
02:16:28,738 --> 02:16:30,501
seems to have helped her dipping career...

2133
02:16:30,773 --> 02:16:32,297
as her latest film, 'Annie'...

2134
02:16:32,375 --> 02:16:34,366
shows the silver lining at the box office.

2135
02:16:34,443 --> 02:16:36,468
With a record breaking first day collection.

2136
02:16:36,746 --> 02:16:38,771
We are Mahi's fans and we will watch 'Annie'.

2137
02:16:38,848 --> 02:16:39,906
We love Mahi.

2138
02:16:40,149 --> 02:16:41,411
Due to the controversy...

2139
02:16:41,484 --> 02:16:43,179
people will watch 'Annie'

2140
02:16:43,252 --> 02:16:44,048
Even l will watch it.

2141
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:45,883
What do you have to say about the controversy?

2142
02:16:45,955 --> 02:16:47,786
l can't comment on the controversy.

2143
02:16:47,857 --> 02:16:49,222
But the film is a super hit in our theatre.

2144
02:16:49,325 --> 02:16:50,189
You can't trust movie stars.

2145
02:16:50,259 --> 02:16:52,022
They will go to any lengths
to make their film a hit.

2146
02:16:52,061 --> 02:16:54,029
Mr. Prahlad Kakkar, what do you
have to say about this controversy?

2147
02:16:54,096 --> 02:16:56,929
Who will decide if the CD is real or fake?

2148
02:16:56,999 --> 02:16:58,227
There's no point in debating this...

2149
02:16:58,300 --> 02:17:00,131
everyone has their personal choices...

2150
02:17:00,202 --> 02:17:02,432
then why so much of drama?

2151
02:17:03,773 --> 02:17:05,400
After all it's a democratic country...

2152
02:17:08,210 --> 02:17:12,237
Rashid bhai, you don't look happy.

2153
02:17:18,854 --> 02:17:20,287
You think this is wrong?

2154
02:17:21,257 --> 02:17:22,315
How does it matter?

2155
02:17:24,727 --> 02:17:28,060
Your film got a bumper opening.

2156
02:17:28,964 --> 02:17:33,094
Both multiplexes and single screens
have reported 95% bookings.

2157
02:17:35,137 --> 02:17:37,002
As for right and wrong...

2158
02:17:39,175 --> 02:17:40,199
who am l to say.

2159
02:17:41,911 --> 02:17:43,139
All l know is...

2160
02:17:43,212 --> 02:17:46,045
the Mahi l had met ten years ago...

2161
02:17:46,115 --> 02:17:47,207
she...

2162
02:17:48,150 --> 02:17:51,119
would've asked this question
before anything could happen.

2163
02:17:52,822 --> 02:17:54,050
Not after.

2164
02:17:58,461 --> 02:18:00,053
Here is your calendar.

2165
02:18:03,699 --> 02:18:04,996
you don't need me anymore.

2166
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:29,020
Sir...

2167
02:18:30,459 --> 02:18:31,289
Sir...

2168
02:18:31,961 --> 02:18:34,759
the media is waiting for you.

2169
02:18:35,164 --> 02:18:36,256
You have to say something.

2170
02:18:39,001 --> 02:18:40,093
ls Mahi's film a success?

2171
02:18:41,170 --> 02:18:44,662
With a scandal like this,
the film had to do well.

2172
02:18:48,177 --> 02:18:49,439
That's all l have to say.

2173
02:18:50,779 --> 02:18:51,746
Okay, sir.

2174
02:19:44,133 --> 02:19:45,657
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Tony!

2175
02:19:45,701 --> 02:19:46,793
Not right now. She is very tired.

2176
02:19:46,869 --> 02:19:49,770
She can't talk right now,
but l will convey your message.

2177
02:19:49,838 --> 02:19:51,931
Thank you.
Okay. Bye.

2178
02:19:52,741 --> 02:19:55,141
Mr. Vikram...

2179
02:19:55,210 --> 02:19:56,734
With the offers pouring in...

2180
02:19:56,812 --> 02:19:59,440
Mahi will be busy for the next two years.

2181
02:19:59,715 --> 02:20:00,238
Right...

2182
02:20:00,316 --> 02:20:03,114
l can only promise you
one film, not two.

2183
02:20:03,185 --> 02:20:04,709
But l will surely get her to talk to you

2184
02:20:04,787 --> 02:20:06,277
Alright, bye.
See you.

2185
02:20:09,358 --> 02:20:10,188
There Mahi...

2186
02:20:10,826 --> 02:20:11,986
this is the fact about our industry.

2187
02:20:12,261 --> 02:20:14,991
One success and they are all back.

2188
02:20:19,435 --> 02:20:20,834
Anyway...

2189
02:20:20,903 --> 02:20:23,337
have you thought about what you're
wearing to the success party?

2190
02:20:23,405 --> 02:20:25,168
A gown, maybe?

2191
02:20:32,948 --> 02:20:37,749
Mahi, this controversy will fade away.

2192
02:20:37,820 --> 02:20:40,050
ln a few days, people will forget about it.

2193
02:20:42,958 --> 02:20:44,357
You should too.

2194
02:20:52,001 --> 02:20:52,763
l'll see you.

2195
02:22:17,820 --> 02:22:18,946
Hello, Manish...

2196
02:22:18,987 --> 02:22:21,182
The media was trying to locate Mahi...

2197
02:22:21,256 --> 02:22:24,225
while she is here at
Shagufta Rizvi's funeral.

2198
02:22:24,293 --> 02:22:26,887
lnform them to send the team here
right away!

2199
02:23:12,875 --> 02:23:15,867
ln this film industry that
venerates the rising star...

2200
02:23:15,944 --> 02:23:20,438
no actor has come to attend the final journey
of beloved actress Shagufta Rizvi.

2201
02:23:20,716 --> 02:23:23,082
ldiot, Mahi is inside.

2202
02:23:23,152 --> 02:23:24,744
Mahi Arora! Come on.

2203
02:23:24,820 --> 02:23:25,377
- Cut!
- Let's run this later.

2204
02:23:28,257 --> 02:23:31,784
We fail to see in the glow of glamour...

2205
02:23:32,728 --> 02:23:34,855
how much we have lost.

2206
02:23:36,398 --> 02:23:41,927
When we realize it, it's often too late.

2207
02:23:48,877 --> 02:23:50,640
Hey Mahi.

2208
02:23:50,712 --> 02:23:55,411
Mahi, Please tell us...
has bollywood hit their own with you scandle?

2209
02:23:55,684 --> 02:23:58,812
What is the hidden story behind it?

2210
02:23:58,887 --> 02:24:02,721
ls it true that you leaked the tape?

2211
02:24:02,791 --> 02:24:05,225
Your PR company...

2212
02:26:33,976 --> 02:26:36,911
Excuse me, aren't you Mahi Arora?

2213
02:26:39,948 --> 02:26:40,209
No.

2214
02:26:43,218 --> 02:26:47,917
This answer simplified Mahi's complicated life.

2215
02:26:47,990 --> 02:26:52,017
For years she looked for happiness
outside the crowd...

2216
02:26:52,394 --> 02:26:54,328
and in the end,
she found it by being part of the crowd...

2217
02:26:54,396 --> 02:26:56,728
living an ordinary life.

2218
