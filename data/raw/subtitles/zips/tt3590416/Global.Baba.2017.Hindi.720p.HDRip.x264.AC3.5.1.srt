00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:18,367
All characters appearing
in this film are fictitious.

2
00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:20,487
Any resemblance to real persons,
alive or dead..

3
00:00:20,567 --> 00:00:21,887
..is purely coincidental.

4
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:10,407
Tell me, who is driving our country?
- The country?

5
00:01:10,687 --> 00:01:12,807
It is not a vehicle
for someone to drive it.

6
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:16,007
And where will they drive it to?
Outside the earth?

7
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,927
Our country will
remain where it was..

8
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:19,029
..and it will remain there forever.

9
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:24,510
I agree. You are right.

10
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:28,407
That's why you are
able to fool everyone..

11
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:29,847
..since so many years.

12
00:01:32,047 --> 00:01:37,167
The country means system
which everyone curses.

13
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:42,927
You and me. And this system
has made us enemies of each other.

14
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:44,087
Cheers.

15
00:01:47,963 --> 00:01:49,847
You are referring
to the powerful foxes.

16
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:52,247
That's where you lost it.

17
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:57,047
The one who are holding
high positions..

18
00:01:57,767 --> 00:01:59,287
..are not running the country.

19
00:01:59,647 --> 00:02:02,847
What we can see is all an act.
Democracy.

20
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:08,047
The real thing goes
on behind the scenes.

21
00:02:08,647 --> 00:02:10,327
Excuse me.
- What?

22
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:12,567
Do you have a light?
- Light.

23
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,447
Here is a lighter.
- I also want a cigarette.

24
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:19,727
All my smokes are over.

25
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:25,687
Who is calling me so late at night?

26
00:02:26,327 --> 00:02:28,727
Okay. You can leave now.
- Yes.

27
00:02:32,447 --> 00:02:34,567
Go.
- Yes, tell me.

28
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:36,647
So where we?

29
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,327
Behind the scenes.
- Yes.

30
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:43,127
Gandhi said that Pandit Nehru..

31
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:44,527
..wanted to be the Prime Minister.

32
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:45,967
The country agreed.

33
00:02:46,047 --> 00:02:47,767
And Pandit Nehru became
the Prime Minister the next day.

34
00:02:47,847 --> 00:02:51,527
Now tell me what political
power supported Pandit.

35
00:02:51,727 --> 00:02:52,527
Tell me.

36
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:54,087
Gandhi was the Mahatma.

37
00:02:55,127 --> 00:02:57,167
Mahatma has their own powers.

38
00:02:57,247 --> 00:02:58,767
They are driving this nation.

39
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:00,527
Mahatma Gandhi?

40
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:04,967
Look at this. Isn't he?

41
00:03:05,047 --> 00:03:07,647
Boy, get a packet of cigarettes.

42
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:18,644
You are drinking so slowly.
Have a neat.

43
00:03:18,724 --> 00:03:19,807
Run.

44
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:25,207
Policemen feed you for
free on only two instances.

45
00:03:26,367 --> 00:03:29,487
One when he is afraid
of losing his job.

46
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:34,567
And second when he is expecting
a medal from the government.

47
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,647
What are you going
to get that today..

48
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:39,247
..you are treating me
to free wisdom and alcohol?

49
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:41,407
Today is good Friday. Our festival.

50
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,487
So I thought I would sit with you.
Enjoy a little.

51
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:47,407
Pray to Jesus Christ.
Have Pehelwan hanged.

52
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:50,847
So you have changed colors.

53
00:03:50,927 --> 00:03:54,567
As soon as the power equations changed,
you changed colour like a chameleon.

54
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:58,847
You didn't recognize
the government Pehelwan.

55
00:03:59,087 --> 00:04:00,487
How would you recognize me?

56
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:02,767
Yes, I have been
trapped today because..

57
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:04,967
..I didn't understand you.

58
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:14,407
Look Jacob,
no police station in this country..

59
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,807
..has got my photo nor
do I have any case against me.

60
00:04:19,087 --> 00:04:23,527
Once Bhanumati returns
to power I will get clean chit.

61
00:04:23,807 --> 00:04:25,247
But what will happen to you?

62
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:28,407
You neither have
a Mahatma nor a Gandhi.

63
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:31,127
You will go directly inside.

64
00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:35,047
Don't scare me.
You have become too serious.

65
00:04:35,287 --> 00:04:36,687
I have drank so much alcohol..

66
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:38,447
..that I might pee in my pants.

67
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,407
Don't scare me. Let's go and pee.

68
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:46,767
You have taken it seriously.
I am just kidding. Come. Come on.

69
00:04:57,767 --> 00:05:00,927
What are you doing? Come. Come.

70
00:05:01,447 --> 00:05:03,127
How far are we going?

71
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:05,287
Do you want to pee
in front of the tiger?

72
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:12,967
Why are you glaring at
me like this? You can pee now.

73
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,207
I know your men
are around somewhere.

74
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:18,807
I won't run away.
- You are very smart.

75
00:05:19,847 --> 00:05:21,207
You haven't understood yet.

76
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,767
I have got you here
to kill you in an encounter.

77
00:05:25,247 --> 00:05:27,407
I told you that only
Mahatma and Gandhi..

78
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:29,007
..running the nation.

79
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,767
Mahatma is the one who
have no evidence of their crimes.

80
00:05:35,447 --> 00:05:37,767
Who ordered me to be killed, Jacob?

81
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:43,567
The same Mahatma to whose
crime you bear witness.

82
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:47,927
You have to die so that he
can have a clean chit, Pehelwan.

83
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:50,007
Don't speak in riddles.
Tell me clearly.

84
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,047
Tell me, who is behind this?

85
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:57,527
Bhanumati.

86
00:06:06,687 --> 00:06:09,007
You are going to
die on a good today.

87
00:06:10,127 --> 00:06:12,407
Today is the day Jesus
Christ had given his blood..

88
00:06:12,487 --> 00:06:14,487
..to pay for our sins.

89
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:17,727
God might forgive you today.

90
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:21,087
You have honored me
a lot by bringing the..

91
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:25,727
..entire army to kill
this unarmed Pehelwan.

92
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:32,327
Give me one more favor.
Turn around.

93
00:06:34,487 --> 00:06:36,447
I need to pee hard.

94
00:06:37,847 --> 00:06:39,327
Go ahead.

95
00:06:48,047 --> 00:06:49,527
Jacob.
- Yes.

96
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:53,127
How can your God
forgive anyone today?

97
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:56,687
His son was crucified today?

98
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,047
If you call this
Friday good Friday then...

99
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:03,247
You are about to die.
You can ask Him yourself.

100
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:06,207
Tell me which hell
would you prefer?

101
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:09,807
Of Hindus,
Christians, Muslims or the Jews.

102
00:07:10,126 --> 00:07:11,300
(Gun Firing)

103
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,414
They is here.
- Catch him.

104
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:21,841
(Crowd Chattering)

105
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,608
(Water Waves Sound)

106
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,727
Sir, he is done for.
- Pehelwan is no more.

107
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:32,687
Shall we?

108
00:10:37,407 --> 00:10:41,127
Hey. Who is it? Greetings Baba.

109
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:44,127
We have arranged for
your bathing in Ghat No. 2.

110
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:46,127
Take a left turn from ahead.

111
00:11:13,687 --> 00:11:17,527
This way, go ahead.

112
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:32,487
You monkey.
Are you in a hurry to meet God?

113
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:37,287
You misunderstand. I am Damroo.

114
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:46,847
Damroo. Damroo.

115
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,070
Sir. What happened? Sir.

116
00:11:57,047 --> 00:11:58,127
Sir.

117
00:12:04,522 --> 00:12:06,554
(Door Opens)

118
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,767
What happened, friend?
Are you okay?

119
00:12:14,246 --> 00:12:17,407
Damroo. Where is Damroo?
- Who is Damroo, friend?

120
00:12:18,527 --> 00:12:21,087
Mouney Baba found you injured.

121
00:12:21,447 --> 00:12:24,967
He brought you here.
Have some offerings.

122
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:31,807
Mouney Baba?

123
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:35,967
Very powerful Baba. Mouney Baba.

124
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:38,607
He has surrendered
his voice to God.

125
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,167
He is always silent.

126
00:12:40,807 --> 00:12:42,247
Take his blessings and let's leave.

127
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:46,088
Greetings, Baba. Greetings, Baba.

128
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,287
Sir, I have been in this
profession for the last 1.5 years.

129
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:00,847
And now I know that no
business is better than religion.

130
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:02,567
And such respect.

131
00:13:02,927 --> 00:13:06,447
Great leaders, kings,
CM, PM, everyone touches your feet.

132
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:09,767
Bhanumati's cronies are
looking for me everywhere.

133
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:11,247
And you are spreading
knowledge here.

134
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:13,767
Just tell me,
where should we run away from here?

135
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:17,447
Shall I cross the border to
Pakistan, Bangladesh or Sri Lanka?

136
00:13:17,807 --> 00:13:18,767
You don't need to go anywhere now.

137
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:20,207
You have reached your destination.

138
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:21,647
In the temple of religion.

139
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:24,287
Everything can change here.

140
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:25,727
You can change too.

141
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:30,847
Even the police, CID, etc.
can't find anyone here? Nothing.

142
00:13:30,927 --> 00:13:34,127
Bhanumati is insignificant in
front of all this. - (Birds Chirping)

143
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:37,567
Just take of this garb
and surrender to River Ganga.

144
00:13:38,007 --> 00:13:40,807
We will start a new game
at an international level.

145
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,447
You want me to turn
to an ascetic like you.

146
00:13:43,527 --> 00:13:46,287
Sir, not an ascetic. I said Baba.

147
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:49,287
I can't do anything
since my speech is impaired.

148
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:51,527
Otherwise I would have gone places.

149
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:55,007
You haven't done anything
but abuse and get abused.

150
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:56,607
And now you want to tell
people about the scriptures.

151
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:58,447
No one has time to
listen to scriptures.

152
00:13:58,647 --> 00:13:59,647
Baba means who takes money..

153
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:01,127
..and shows the shortcut to heaven.

154
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:03,607
And enough money to even
give loans to Swiss banks.

155
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:06,327
Stay like kings.
Just watch. Listen to me.

156
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:10,447
Say goodbye to the past
and turn over a new leaf.

157
00:14:10,527 --> 00:14:12,750
(Birds Chirping)

158
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,967
Sir is giving up his body.

159
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,247
Keep it.
I am renouncing everything.

160
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:23,967
Are you going to
give me everything?

161
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:26,007
Don't stop.
Just give everything away.

162
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:27,367
Even your chain.

163
00:14:29,474 --> 00:14:31,527
(Birds Chirping)

164
00:14:31,607 --> 00:14:32,967
Very good.

165
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:35,487
Hail Mahadev. Hail Babaji.

166
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:43,069
(Temple Bell)

167
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:55,354
(Gun Firing)

168
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:16,638
(Conch Shell Blowing)

169
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:41,207
Sir, it seems like a small place.
But it is gold.

170
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:42,607
There is a lot of property.

171
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,247
It's a city of black marketers!

172
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:46,647
Kabirganj.

173
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:51,567
What they say?
Cottage industries. Handicrafts.

174
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:54,327
Everything is exported.
So they earn in dollars.

175
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:57,967
Goodness.
Do you remember the Dhuliya?

176
00:15:58,047 --> 00:15:59,567
He has his own bank here.

177
00:15:59,767 --> 00:16:01,527
We need to join hands with him.

178
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:16,567
What is this?

179
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:19,327
You said that there is
no shop for religion here?

180
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:24,007
Sir, I was about to tell
you about it. It's nothing.

181
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:25,927
Look at the name below.

182
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:28,807
Bholanath Tripathi, Former MLC.

183
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:31,807
He is just a former politician.
Nothing else.

184
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:34,327
He used to do perform
protests in villages here.

185
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:37,607
Now he doesn't bother
about money etc.

186
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:39,967
People respect him somewhat.

187
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,927
We will take over his
shop and start our business.

188
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:46,207
Sir, I know.

189
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:50,447
We have come here in
a public bus without a ticket.

190
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:53,807
And we will leave
from here in an airplane.

191
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:58,727
Sir, I want to ask you
something I was thinking about.

192
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:00,407
What is your real name?

193
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:05,847
So aren't you going
to give yourself a name?

194
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:08,088
Everyone has one.
Do you want a name or not?

195
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:09,487
My name is Damroo.

196
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,967
A dream of a glorious India.

197
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:31,767
A dream of a beautiful India.

198
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:36,167
It is the rule of nature
that as you sow so shall you reap.

199
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:37,767
The India of the future.

200
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:41,167
So teach them good things
today so that our future..

201
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:43,167
..and the future of
the country is secured.

202
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,527
Right, Mr. Agarwal? What happened?

203
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:46,807
I am very troubled, Pandit.
- What happened?

204
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:48,767
It seems someone has
cast an evil eye on my health.

205
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:50,047
What did the doctor say?

206
00:17:50,127 --> 00:17:51,647
First I tested positive
for high sugar.

207
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:54,727
And the BP and now
because of cholesterol..

208
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,687
..I have been asked
to do a bypass surgery.

209
00:17:58,127 --> 00:18:00,407
My wife is saying
that surely someone..

210
00:18:00,487 --> 00:18:01,887
..has done hoodoo on my health.

211
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:03,047
That mean some has cast an evil eye.
- Yes.

212
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:06,687
You are a great man.
Please cure me of this.

213
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,607
Manku, forget the tea.

214
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,087
Go inside and get the ashes
from the incense that is burning.

215
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,687
And rub it on his pajamas.

216
00:18:11,816 --> 00:18:12,487
(Laughing)

217
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,487
What are you saying?
- What else should I say?

218
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,847
Mr. Agarwal I have told
you several times to perform yoga.

219
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:18,927
Exercise a little.

220
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:22,127
You will eat fried fish,
chicken etc.

221
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:23,647
How would that do?

222
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:25,607
Your wife says that
some has cast an evil eye.

223
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:27,127
Manku, take off the pajamas..

224
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:28,367
..maybe you will
get rid of the evil eye.

225
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:31,367
Go and do yoga, Mr. Agarwal.
I am not joking.

226
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:32,927
What will you do with the body?

227
00:18:33,207 --> 00:18:34,887
Go and do some Yoga there.

228
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,687
Pandit, tell us what should
I do with the doors and windows...

229
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:41,087
What happened? Have they got termites?
- No.

230
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,247
Nothing is safe in the house..

231
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:45,807
..where we were
able find everything.

232
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:47,327
Theft is increasing.

233
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:50,087
Pandit, I took a loan from
the bank to open a factory.

234
00:18:50,447 --> 00:18:52,287
I lost everything overnight.
- The police....

235
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:53,927
The police does nothing, Pandit.

236
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:56,687
They have now 14 police
stations instead of 4.

237
00:18:57,127 --> 00:18:58,087
But what's the use?

238
00:18:58,167 --> 00:18:59,487
There is an old saying.

239
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:03,727
A hut of smart men in
the neighborhood of fools.

240
00:19:04,127 --> 00:19:06,327
How can we act wise in this world?

241
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:08,247
One minute. One minute. One minute.

242
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:10,927
What happened?
- I need your blessings.

243
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:12,327
I have come from far away.

244
00:19:12,687 --> 00:19:14,287
I had come to take your blessing.
I am leaving now.

245
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:15,487
It's okay.
Where are you from?

246
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:17,927
Nowhere? I had travelled
a 1000 miles on foot. - Okay.

247
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:19,407
Tell me.
- Yes.

248
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:21,487
These innocent people.
- Yes.

249
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:23,527
They come here with their problems.
- Of course.

250
00:19:23,607 --> 00:19:24,647
And you are making fun of them.

251
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:25,487
I am not making fun of them.

252
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,967
You are talking
indecently with them.

253
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:30,167
I had come from far
away to be taught by you.

254
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:31,607
But you have opened my eyes.

255
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:34,047
Look, sir. I name is Bhola Pandit.

256
00:19:34,327 --> 00:19:35,327
Do you understand?

257
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:39,087
I am not Baba Ramdev
for you to come from far away.

258
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:41,247
So sorry.
- No, you can't be like Ramdev.

259
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:42,487
You can't even be his assistant.

260
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:45,287
That is too much, bro.
- Listen. Don't shout.

261
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,887
Calm down.
He has got the right to speak.

262
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:48,127
I don't want to say anything.

263
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:49,767
You can go your way.

264
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:52,127
I have found the real one
in my search of the fake.

265
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:55,167
If I had not come here than
I wouldn't even met Global Baba.

266
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:55,847
Who?

267
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:56,967
Global Baba.

268
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:00,367
Globe. The earth.

269
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,407
Globe.
- And it's Global.

270
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:05,687
Global Baba.
- Okay, Global Baba.

271
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:07,607
Who is he?
- That was the name he gave me.

272
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,567
Last night at Kabirganj.

273
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:12,047
And I saw that my neck was hurt.

274
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:13,407
What happened?

275
00:20:13,487 --> 00:20:16,047
The thieves of Kabirganj stole it.
- What?

276
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:21,207
This on and then some
came and said that..

277
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:22,327
..Global Baba has come here.

278
00:20:22,407 --> 00:20:23,327
He is taking rest there.

279
00:20:23,407 --> 00:20:24,727
In Kabirganj.
- Yes, in Kabirganj.

280
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,407
A 6 feet man was lying like this.

281
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:28,927
A cobra was at his head.

282
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:30,527
Cobra?
- Yes.

283
00:20:30,607 --> 00:20:32,047
King cobra.
- King cobra?

284
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,087
I became nervous.
I was not even able to speak.

285
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,847
Baba suddenly opened his
eyes and asked what happened?

286
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:39,527
I said I have been robbed.

287
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:42,207
He concentrated and told me
the address right away.

288
00:20:42,287 --> 00:20:43,527
What is his name?
- Global Baba.

289
00:20:43,607 --> 00:20:44,527
Yes, Global Baba.
- In Kabirganj.

290
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:46,767
Yes, in Kabirganj. He is sitting
there. 10 minutes away from here.

291
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:49,247
He is an atom bomb.

292
00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:51,247
You are just a cracker.
Forgive me. I am leaving.

293
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,167
Oh no.
- Sorry. Get away.

294
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,767
Brother. Brother, stop.

295
00:20:57,847 --> 00:21:00,487
Don't you dare follow me.
The true finds the truth.

296
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:01,447
And the false finds falsehoods.

297
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:04,287
You deserve him. Bye.
- Brother listen.

298
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,367
Please take us to Global baba.

299
00:21:06,447 --> 00:21:07,527
Don't bother me.

300
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:17,607
Don't bother me.

301
00:21:19,327 --> 00:21:23,247
That man there. He is your savior.
He will help you.

302
00:21:23,327 --> 00:21:25,887
Don't follow me, rascals. Go away.

303
00:21:26,407 --> 00:21:27,847
Brother, listen to me.

304
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,287
Go away. Don't follow me.

305
00:21:31,607 --> 00:21:33,567
Where are you going?
- Listen to me.

306
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:35,607
Where is Baba?

307
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,447
Baba.
- That is not him.

308
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:39,327
Go away. Go.

309
00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:43,447
Because of you I lost
such a great person.

310
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:46,087
Brother! Come here. Here.

311
00:21:48,327 --> 00:21:51,127
Is that him?
- Yes, he is Global baba.

312
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:54,047
He is Global Baba.
- But this tiger.

313
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:56,727
When I met him this
tiger was not with him.

314
00:21:56,807 --> 00:21:58,287
How did a tiger
came in to Kabirganj?

315
00:21:58,367 --> 00:21:59,287
I don't know.

316
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:02,447
He is playing with
the tiger like a pet dog.

317
00:22:02,527 --> 00:22:05,287
Move. Move. Baba.
- Do you want us to die?

318
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:06,367
Why are you disturbing him?

319
00:22:06,447 --> 00:22:08,447
If he became angry and
let the tiger loose on us..

320
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:09,847
..then all of us
will be in trouble.

321
00:22:09,927 --> 00:22:11,887
Move. Baba.

322
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:13,127
Hey, run!

323
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:24,807
You. Get up.
Get up. Child, What are you doing?

324
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:27,207
That's enough.
Get up. What happened?

325
00:22:27,687 --> 00:22:29,367
Did you find your lost property?

326
00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:31,887
Baba, I found it.
Baba, you are great.

327
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:35,327
Baba, I thought I have missed you.

328
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:37,967
Baba, that tiger?

329
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:42,767
That tiger was my old landlord.
- Landlord?

330
00:22:42,847 --> 00:22:46,327
Yes. I had done penance
for years in his cave.

331
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,167
In the mountains of Prayagraj.

332
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,847
The poor thing didn't even take any money.
- Wow.

333
00:22:52,007 --> 00:22:54,927
Since I left without informing
him he became worried.

334
00:22:55,447 --> 00:22:57,207
By the way even you
had gone to meet your Guru.

335
00:22:57,287 --> 00:22:57,807
What happened?

336
00:22:57,887 --> 00:23:01,167
Sir, I met him what can I say?

337
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:03,047
He is nothing compared to you.

338
00:23:03,247 --> 00:23:05,447
Please accept me as your disciple,
Baba. Please.

339
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:07,527
What will you do with me, child?

340
00:23:08,007 --> 00:23:09,687
I have got no house or address.

341
00:23:10,007 --> 00:23:11,927
There are many famous
ascetics in this world..

342
00:23:12,207 --> 00:23:14,927
..with their own
temples and hermitages.

343
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:18,567
Go and join one of them.
- No Baba.

344
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:21,407
I don't want to join any one.
All are thieves.

345
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:24,847
Don't deny me.
You are the powerhouse of miracles.

346
00:23:24,927 --> 00:23:28,087
All else are burnt out bulbs.
Save me.

347
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:31,647
Take me at your feet.
- Baba. Baba. Baba.

348
00:23:33,487 --> 00:23:36,807
All right. I will help you all.

349
00:23:37,407 --> 00:23:39,087
I have taken rest in your city.

350
00:23:39,447 --> 00:23:40,607
So I am indebted to you.

351
00:23:40,807 --> 00:23:43,447
Just tell me your
problems one by one.

352
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:46,407
I will forward all your
requests to the global godfather.

353
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:48,859
The rest is all on Him.
- Global godfather?

354
00:23:48,939 --> 00:23:50,087
Shut up.
- Baba.

355
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:51,687
Baba, save me.
- You get up.

356
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:54,887
Baba, he is a genuine man.
Listen to his problem.

357
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,767
Baba.

358
00:23:58,207 --> 00:24:01,087
You are leaving a
government building..

359
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:02,727
..with a packet in your hand.

360
00:24:03,967 --> 00:24:06,887
You are right, Baba.
That's the bank.

361
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:08,487
It happened last week.

362
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:10,487
It contains your lifelong dream.

363
00:24:11,087 --> 00:24:14,807
Yes, Baba. I took a loan
of 12 lakhs from the bank.

364
00:24:15,651 --> 00:24:18,718
It was robbed. I am ruined, Baba.

365
00:24:19,087 --> 00:24:22,047
I am ruined. Help me.

366
00:24:22,807 --> 00:24:23,687
A building under construction.

367
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:26,515
A shop behind.
A pile of sand and a tree.

368
00:24:27,847 --> 00:24:29,173
What does that mean, sir?

369
00:24:29,253 --> 00:24:30,287
This is how Baba offers solutions.

370
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:32,967
When I lost my locket he said poop,
vegetable, funnel cake.

371
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:34,967
I found it in the toilet
behind the funnel cake shop..

372
00:24:35,047 --> 00:24:36,727
..in the vegetable market.
- Yes.

373
00:24:37,647 --> 00:24:38,327
A building under construction.

374
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:40,447
A shop behind.
A pile of sand and a tree.

375
00:24:40,527 --> 00:24:41,847
What does that mean?
- Listen. Listen.

376
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:43,447
What?
- Mr. Chaubey's shop.

377
00:24:43,687 --> 00:24:45,167
Yes.
- A building is being constructed there.

378
00:24:45,247 --> 00:24:48,167
Yes. - It also has a pile of sand
and also a tree.

379
00:24:48,247 --> 00:24:50,087
Then what are we waiting for?
Let's go.

380
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:51,247
Hail Global Baba.

381
00:24:51,327 --> 00:24:57,887
"This is neither
friendship nor enmity."

382
00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:04,367
"Fate became a puppet
in the game of black magic."

383
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:05,727
Hail Global Baba.

384
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:08,607
"The official Global Baba."

385
00:25:08,887 --> 00:25:10,047
"Check this out."

386
00:25:10,497 --> 00:25:11,887
Hail Global Baba.

387
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:13,253
I found my money.

388
00:25:16,207 --> 00:25:18,696
Baba you are great.
I found my money.

389
00:25:20,447 --> 00:25:23,847
"You remember the Baba
when you are in trouble."

390
00:25:23,927 --> 00:25:27,127
"Baba is your ambrosia."

391
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:31,247
"Baba is the tonic
to get rid of problems."

392
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:34,647
"Baba can get rid
of eras of problems."

393
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:38,807
"The one who touches
his feet becomes lucky."

394
00:25:38,887 --> 00:25:41,887
"The time of Baba is bigger
than the time of royalty."

395
00:25:42,487 --> 00:25:44,397
"The time of Baba is bigger
than the time of royalty."

396
00:25:44,527 --> 00:25:48,127
Get lost. Acting smart with me.

397
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:50,327
Look how much we have
got in our first offerings.

398
00:25:50,407 --> 00:25:52,367
Sir, what are you showing me?

399
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:55,527
You have returned the stuff
stolen with such difficulty.

400
00:25:55,607 --> 00:25:57,407
We would had had good
food with that money.

401
00:25:58,327 --> 00:26:00,807
Not you but the priest
who would come to perform..

402
00:26:01,047 --> 00:26:02,367
..your funeral would
have had good food.

403
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:06,527
The protection of this
entire area has been destroyed.

404
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:09,407
Global bad spirits are eyeing it.

405
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:12,007
It is not possible to stop
the thieving going on here.

406
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:14,167
Baba, don't say so.
Baba, don't say so.

407
00:26:14,247 --> 00:26:15,887
You are our last hope, baba.

408
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:17,087
Please give us a solution, Baba.

409
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:19,087
The one who wants
a protection amulet..

410
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:21,087
..will have to give
one tenth of his income..

411
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:23,607
..to the global godfather.

412
00:26:24,247 --> 00:26:25,967
This is our global godfather.

413
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:29,527
"He created such an illusion
with crocodile tears."

414
00:26:29,727 --> 00:26:33,287
"This is where the
Baba will operate from."

415
00:26:33,487 --> 00:26:37,007
"With the blessings
of the global godfather..

416
00:26:37,087 --> 00:26:40,687
..every house will
see a globalized morning."

417
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:44,487
"Look how sick they
are with superstition."

418
00:26:44,567 --> 00:26:47,687
"The time of Baba is bigger
than the time of royalty."

419
00:26:48,127 --> 00:26:51,247
"The time of Baba is bigger
than the time of royalty."

420
00:26:51,687 --> 00:26:55,447
"The time of Baba is bigger
than the time of royalty."

421
00:27:10,327 --> 00:27:13,887
"Baba's graph rose like inflation."

422
00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:17,567
"Baba has got both
curses and blessings."

423
00:27:19,607 --> 00:27:21,647
You have got a very
difficult problem.

424
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:22,647
Wow Baba.

425
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:24,967
You are the first great
man to catch bad luck.

426
00:27:25,047 --> 00:27:28,727
"People wash of their
sins and head for heaven."

427
00:27:28,807 --> 00:27:32,014
"The time of Baba is bigger
than the time of royalty."

428
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:34,207
Take water from the bottom
of the river every morning.

429
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:36,927
And you will have to pour
it on the top of the mountain.

430
00:27:37,007 --> 00:27:39,287
And don't you dare stop.
Don't stop.

431
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,087
And what will you
say on your way there?

432
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:43,087
Global Baba.
- Mr. Agarwal.

433
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:44,887
Hail Global Baba. Hail Global Baba.

434
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:47,407
"Hail. Hail. Hail. Hail baba."
- They're experts at committing crime.

435
00:27:47,487 --> 00:27:50,247
He's recently been
released from Tihar jail.

436
00:27:50,327 --> 00:27:52,167
"Hail. Hail. Hail. Hail baba."

437
00:27:52,247 --> 00:27:55,367
"PM, DM, CM, everyone holds his feet."

438
00:27:55,847 --> 00:27:59,287
"They wait until
they get to meet him"

439
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:01,007
"Everyone bows down to him..

440
00:28:01,087 --> 00:28:02,887
..no matter how great they are."

441
00:28:03,207 --> 00:28:06,727
"Money is showered
on him in great amounts."

442
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:10,887
"Lot of people come
to pay homage to the Baba."

443
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:13,727
"The time of Baba is bigger
than the time of royalty."

444
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:17,287
"The time of Baba is bigger
than the time of royalty."

445
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:19,847
"The time of Baba is bigger
than the time of royalty."

446
00:28:19,927 --> 00:28:21,447
"Hail Global Baba."

447
00:28:21,647 --> 00:28:27,007
Baba you are great.
You have cured my husband.

448
00:28:27,087 --> 00:28:29,527
You did what even
medicine couldn't do.

449
00:28:29,727 --> 00:28:31,807
Say, Hail Global Baba.

450
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:35,625
Open your eyes Mr. DM.
This is government land.

451
00:28:35,807 --> 00:28:37,687
Government land. Forest land.

452
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:40,407
As per the Indian
constitution this land..

453
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:43,327
..is preserved for them. For them.

454
00:28:43,887 --> 00:28:46,607
The one who is fighting
for their lives and hunger.

455
00:28:46,687 --> 00:28:48,447
They are fighting
for their existence..

456
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,087
..in your so called moral society.

457
00:28:50,245 --> 00:28:53,287
Because Babas and dacoits
have taken over their land..

458
00:28:53,487 --> 00:28:54,967
..with help from the
police and the system.

459
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:57,567
Do you have any answer for them?
Tell me.

460
00:28:58,087 --> 00:29:01,087
Pandit, I did send
my officers here 2-3 times.

461
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:02,567
They have been said that this..

462
00:29:02,647 --> 00:29:03,807
..is a temporary religious camp.

463
00:29:03,887 --> 00:29:05,247
And it will be taken down soon.

464
00:29:05,447 --> 00:29:06,767
What are you saying Mr. DM.

465
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:08,687
You are talking like a blind man.

466
00:29:08,927 --> 00:29:10,487
Do you think this is temporary?

467
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:14,047
This is a permanent
slap on your secularism.

468
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:18,767
The paper he is holding
looks more temporary than this.

469
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,767
Whereas law says that
this land belongs to them.

470
00:29:22,687 --> 00:29:25,487
Whom should we complain to?
Who will protect them?

471
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,567
The police who are
pandering to the Baba.

472
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:30,607
Answer them not me.

473
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:33,367
Pandit, I will send them
an evacuation notice soon.

474
00:29:33,447 --> 00:29:35,047
And have them leave
this place soon.

475
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,047
He will send them notice.
The same rigmarole.

476
00:29:38,687 --> 00:29:40,727
Government work will go on.

477
00:29:40,807 --> 00:29:43,327
You sent notices and they
will put stay order on it.

478
00:29:43,527 --> 00:29:45,287
You will file a case
against that stay order.

479
00:29:45,447 --> 00:29:47,047
And they will file a
harassment case against you.

480
00:29:47,247 --> 00:29:49,327
And this is how time will fly.

481
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:50,727
What will happen to him?

482
00:29:50,807 --> 00:29:54,167
He will die soon while
waiting for his justice.

483
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:58,167
Forget him. He has lived his life.
This is Tulsi.

484
00:29:59,127 --> 00:30:01,887
She has born in India,
the best place in the world.

485
00:30:02,648 --> 00:30:06,247
Her protectors have
made her future bleak.

486
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:10,087
Dear, say hello to uncle.

487
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:12,247
You can go and pander to the Baba.

488
00:30:12,447 --> 00:30:13,327
You are the DM now.

489
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:14,927
Soon you will become
home secretary.

490
00:30:15,687 --> 00:30:17,687
What about her?
She has taken birth to die.

491
00:30:19,327 --> 00:30:23,034
Come. They will issue a stay order.
Let's go.

492
00:30:45,247 --> 00:30:46,447
What are you doing Gupta?

493
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:48,727
Changing the name
of the shop, Pandit.

494
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:53,447
Does your global father
only have fathers?

495
00:30:53,527 --> 00:30:54,167
Does he have any mother too?

496
00:30:54,247 --> 00:30:55,567
He only has a father, priest.

497
00:30:56,207 --> 00:30:58,247
He is from a different
planet where..

498
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:00,567
..they have no mother.
Just fathers.

499
00:31:00,647 --> 00:31:02,927
Pandit, you are insulting Baba.

500
00:31:03,007 --> 00:31:05,367
I am quite because I respect you.

501
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:07,607
Others would have
retaliated accordingly.

502
00:31:07,807 --> 00:31:09,207
Why are you respecting me?

503
00:31:09,647 --> 00:31:10,847
When you can change
the name of your shop from..

504
00:31:10,927 --> 00:31:13,247
..Hanuman Juice center
to the name of a thief..

505
00:31:13,327 --> 00:31:14,687
..who has stolen government land..

506
00:31:15,087 --> 00:31:16,327
..then you can retaliate openly.

507
00:31:16,687 --> 00:31:18,047
Your society is strange.

508
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:20,127
Beware Pandit.

509
00:31:20,207 --> 00:31:22,487
Don't you dare say anything
against Global baba.

510
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,708
(Crowd Chattering)

511
00:32:31,607 --> 00:32:35,247
"If anyone tries to attack Baba."

512
00:32:35,327 --> 00:32:38,927
"Even the government is shaken."

513
00:32:39,007 --> 00:32:42,487
"The one who messes with
religion is gone forever."

514
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:46,207
"Everything is finished
at just one call."

515
00:32:46,287 --> 00:32:49,967
"The saffron robes weigh
heavy on the khaki uniform."

516
00:32:50,047 --> 00:32:53,167
"The time of Baba is bigger
than the time of royalty."

517
00:32:53,527 --> 00:32:56,367
"The time of Baba is bigger
than the time of royalty."

518
00:32:56,927 --> 00:32:59,367
It is very shocking that
the most peaceful district of..

519
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:03,247
..the country Kabirganj
has become a center of riots.

520
00:33:03,407 --> 00:33:05,407
The state government
has taken strict steps..

521
00:33:05,487 --> 00:33:07,167
..and have transferred
the DM of Kabirganj..

522
00:33:07,247 --> 00:33:09,887
..along with half a
dozen other high officials.

523
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:11,167
And has announced that they will..

524
00:33:11,247 --> 00:33:12,407
..find out the cause of the riots.

525
00:33:12,487 --> 00:33:15,967
We have with us PC Jacob,
the new police chief of Kabirganj.

526
00:33:16,047 --> 00:33:18,127
Bhavna. Bhavna. My battery is over.

527
00:33:18,727 --> 00:33:20,607
Sorry. Sorry.
I will just get it. Just a moment.

528
00:33:20,687 --> 00:33:22,687
What kind of cartoons
I have to deal with it.

529
00:33:24,287 --> 00:33:26,127
Sorry, Mr. Jacob. Just 2 minutes.

530
00:33:26,207 --> 00:33:27,727
Why are you saying sorry?

531
00:33:27,807 --> 00:33:29,487
Actually I should be thanking you.

532
00:33:29,647 --> 00:33:32,687
This was my first interview
and I was nervous.

533
00:33:33,007 --> 00:33:34,047
Thank you.

534
00:33:34,607 --> 00:33:36,407
Mr. Jacob, how will you
control the situation here..

535
00:33:36,487 --> 00:33:38,247
..if you are so nervous?

536
00:33:38,607 --> 00:33:40,207
The situation is already
under control, madam.

537
00:33:40,647 --> 00:33:42,127
The little tension that
you see here will be over..

538
00:33:42,207 --> 00:33:44,807
..after the home
minister's visit tomorrow.

539
00:33:45,647 --> 00:33:47,367
Just take care of
your battery's charge.

540
00:33:47,607 --> 00:33:50,127
The police force here
is charged up already.

541
00:33:50,647 --> 00:33:52,727
Nice meeting you.
- Same here.

542
00:33:53,127 --> 00:33:54,527
We swear on Global Baba.

543
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:55,967
The hermitage won't be moved.

544
00:33:56,047 --> 00:33:57,247
We swear on Global Baba.

545
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:58,743
The hermitage won't be moved.

546
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:08,327
We swear on Global Baba.

547
00:34:08,407 --> 00:34:10,087
The hermitage won't be moved.

548
00:34:11,127 --> 00:34:12,687
I apologise to all.

549
00:34:13,127 --> 00:34:14,687
I have come to meet the people..

550
00:34:14,767 --> 00:34:16,527
..who have been effected
by the riots right now.

551
00:34:16,767 --> 00:34:20,167
Please come with your
questions to my residence.

552
00:34:20,247 --> 00:34:21,127
I will answer them.

553
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:23,087
The minister.
- Hail him.

554
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:25,407
The minister.
- Hail him.

555
00:34:39,487 --> 00:34:40,687
How is your son?

556
00:34:40,887 --> 00:34:43,727
Can't you see what
is wrong with my son?

557
00:34:44,807 --> 00:34:47,007
Why are you all so angry with me?

558
00:34:48,447 --> 00:34:50,807
I am worried about
the peace of the state..

559
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:52,887
..and the security of you people.

560
00:34:53,207 --> 00:34:54,287
Is this how you are going
to ensure our security?

561
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:56,567
Entire Kabirganj is robbed.
You have ruined it.

562
00:34:56,647 --> 00:34:58,407
Global baba.
- Hail him.

563
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:00,156
Global baba.
- Hail him.

564
00:35:00,287 --> 00:35:01,927
Global baba.
- Hail him.

565
00:35:02,127 --> 00:35:03,807
Global baba.
- Hail him.

566
00:35:04,047 --> 00:35:05,527
Global baba.
- Hail him.

567
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,487
Global baba.
- Hail him.

568
00:35:08,327 --> 00:35:10,207
Global baba.
- Hail him.

569
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:11,927
Global baba.
- Hail him.

570
00:35:12,007 --> 00:35:13,567
Global baba.
- Hail him.

571
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:15,527
Global baba.
- Hail him.

572
00:35:19,407 --> 00:35:21,247
Global baba.
- Hail him.

573
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,847
Global baba.
- Hail him.

574
00:35:22,927 --> 00:35:24,407
Global baba.
- Hail him.

575
00:35:26,527 --> 00:35:31,207
Global baba.
- Hail him.

576
00:35:31,287 --> 00:35:36,647
Global baba.
- Hail him.

577
00:35:36,727 --> 00:35:41,167
Global baba.
- Hail him.

578
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:43,727
Global baba.
- Hail him.

579
00:35:43,807 --> 00:35:45,767
Greetings Baba.
My brother has lost his arm.

580
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:46,527
He might have even lost his head.

581
00:35:46,607 --> 00:35:48,527
But your hermitage
should be protected, Baba.

582
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:50,247
Your hermitage
shouldn't break, Baba.

583
00:35:50,327 --> 00:35:52,207
It won't. You all are there.

584
00:36:03,687 --> 00:36:04,807
We swear on Global Baba.

585
00:36:04,887 --> 00:36:06,527
The hermitage won't be moved.

586
00:36:06,607 --> 00:36:07,847
We swear on Global Baba.

587
00:36:07,927 --> 00:36:09,367
The hermitage won't be moved.

588
00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:10,647
We swear on Global Baba.

589
00:36:10,727 --> 00:36:12,127
The hermitage won't be moved.

590
00:36:12,207 --> 00:36:13,407
We swear on Global Baba.

591
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:14,367
The hermitage won't be moved.

592
00:36:14,447 --> 00:36:15,287
There is the Baba.
- Come on.

593
00:36:15,367 --> 00:36:16,447
We swear on Global Baba.
- You don't worry.

594
00:36:16,527 --> 00:36:17,767
The hermitage won't be moved.
- Situation is under control.

595
00:36:17,847 --> 00:36:18,447
Police is trying...

596
00:36:18,527 --> 00:36:21,887
The people want to
know who is behind this.

597
00:36:22,807 --> 00:36:25,567
Baba. Greetings. Remember me?

598
00:36:25,647 --> 00:36:28,487
We met at Allahabad during Kumbh.

599
00:36:28,617 --> 00:36:29,927
I also did a segment on you.

600
00:36:30,007 --> 00:36:32,247
Oh yes. How are you?

601
00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:34,967
I am fine. But your voice.

602
00:36:35,287 --> 00:36:35,847
What?

603
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,767
You were Mouney baba right?

604
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:39,847
I was Mouney baba.

605
00:36:40,127 --> 00:36:42,247
But Global Baba cured my voice.

606
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:44,047
It was miraculous.

607
00:36:44,247 --> 00:36:46,447
Then why didn't he perform
the miracle completely?

608
00:36:46,767 --> 00:36:48,487
I mean he could have
made you speak clear.

609
00:36:48,767 --> 00:36:49,807
Why are you speaking with a slur?

610
00:36:49,887 --> 00:36:54,167
You don't understand.
My body is 35 years old.

611
00:36:54,247 --> 00:36:56,487
But my voice is only 4 months old.

612
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,927
So it is going to be slurry.
What are you doing?

613
00:36:59,007 --> 00:36:59,807
Baba, I was just
checking my lenses.

614
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:03,287
Listen. Come to the ashram.
And we will talk.

615
00:37:03,447 --> 00:37:07,167
All right. Take care.
I will also make your life good.

616
00:37:07,447 --> 00:37:08,687
Bye. Take care.

617
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,007
(Laughing)

618
00:37:12,087 --> 00:37:13,527
Jokes aside, Pandit.

619
00:37:14,127 --> 00:37:16,727
Don't you think the
issue of the hermitage..

620
00:37:16,807 --> 00:37:18,367
..on Adivasi land a
little tricky and sensitive?

621
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:19,367
Yes, it is tricky.

622
00:37:19,927 --> 00:37:21,487
Then is it okay
to leave such issues..

623
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:23,247
..on such emotional people?

624
00:37:23,647 --> 00:37:24,887
What do you want to say?

625
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:27,127
I mean the sensible
people of Kabirganj..

626
00:37:27,207 --> 00:37:29,727
..should come together on this.

627
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:31,367
Otherwise it can
blow out of proportion.

628
00:37:31,447 --> 00:37:33,127
The sensible people of Kabirganj.
Who are they?

629
00:37:33,287 --> 00:37:35,167
Sensible people like
you and the ones..

630
00:37:35,247 --> 00:37:36,807
..who follow your ideologies.

631
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,527
Who follows my ideologies?

632
00:37:39,327 --> 00:37:41,007
Dallu Yadav?

633
00:37:41,847 --> 00:37:44,087
Just tell me that you
have got a proposal from him.

634
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:46,567
You work in his channel
so hail Dallu Yadav.

635
00:37:46,647 --> 00:37:49,047
It is not like that, Pandit.
You know me.

636
00:37:49,407 --> 00:37:52,007
I accept that Dallu
asked me to talk to you but...

637
00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:53,327
What did he tell you?

638
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:58,287
He must have told you
that Bhavna go and request him.

639
00:37:58,367 --> 00:38:01,407
Tell him to support
me in politics and win..

640
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,487
..so that he can betray me again.

641
00:38:03,567 --> 00:38:06,527
Hello, Pandit.
- Hello.

642
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,847
I am the new city SP here.
My name is Jacob.

643
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:13,047
Welcome. Welcome. Please sit.
- Hello.

644
00:38:13,127 --> 00:38:14,127
This is Bhavna Sharma. My child.

645
00:38:14,207 --> 00:38:16,047
Yes, I have met you.
You are a journalist.

646
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,207
The batteries are charged, madam.

647
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,487
(Laughing)

648
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:20,207
What batteries
are you referring to?

649
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:23,127
Is see that your batteries
are charged, Jacob.

650
00:38:23,407 --> 00:38:24,447
Have you got my arrest warrant?

651
00:38:24,647 --> 00:38:26,287
Arrest warrant for you?
Why, Pandit?

652
00:38:26,487 --> 00:38:28,447
I was the main reason
of those riots.

653
00:38:29,127 --> 00:38:32,887
I forced the DM to break
the wall of the hermitage.

654
00:38:33,207 --> 00:38:34,647
Well than I must thank you, Pandit.

655
00:38:34,727 --> 00:38:36,847
Kabirganj has turned into hell
and you are thanking me.

656
00:38:37,047 --> 00:38:37,767
No, Pandit.

657
00:38:37,847 --> 00:38:41,647
Actually I have got promoted
because of your riots.

658
00:38:41,727 --> 00:38:43,927
No, I haven't had you promoted.

659
00:38:44,127 --> 00:38:46,527
You got promoted because
of your name. Jacob.

660
00:38:47,046 --> 00:38:48,607
Jacob, consider this promotion..

661
00:38:48,687 --> 00:38:50,367
..to be a gift from Jesus Christ.

662
00:38:50,447 --> 00:38:52,487
Because the Adivasi
people worship them.

663
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:56,487
Her great boss Dallu Yadav
is going to play..

664
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:59,527
..the Adivasi card
this time in elections.

665
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:01,327
Look, he has even called you here.

666
00:39:01,687 --> 00:39:03,567
I have heard that even
the new DM is an Adivasi.

667
00:39:03,647 --> 00:39:06,087
Move. We won't open the gate.

668
00:39:06,255 --> 00:39:07,600
Do you know who is he?
- Who?

669
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,047
He is the home minister of state.

670
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,240
He is not even stopped abroad and..

671
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,000
..you are stopping him
in his own state.

672
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,520
Look, sir.
I don't know about all that.

673
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
This is Global Baba's Ashram.

674
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,960
And here only he reigns supreme.

675
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,120
If you want to come in then
queue up otherwise you can return.

676
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,240
Listen. Listen. Listen to me.
- Go, Go away.

677
00:39:28,316 --> 00:39:29,613
(Door Opens)

678
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,080
Global baba.
- Hello. - Hello.

679
00:39:32,974 --> 00:39:34,170
(Door Closes)

680
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,320
Uncle, he is asking us to queue up.

681
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,880
Come, sir. Come ahead of us.
- All right.

682
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,160
Come on. Move on.
- Hello, Baba.

683
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,200
Come on.

684
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,840
Go and take the offerings
from there. Move on.

685
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,000
Just think about what you want.

686
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,160
The lord will understand everything.

687
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,160
He can read people's minds.
Come on.

688
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,720
Move from here.
Hey, send the women there.

689
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,040
Hello, Baba.

690
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,600
He was born because
of your blessings.

691
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,840
Bless him.
- Come.

692
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,920
Ladies go there.

693
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,400
Sir, go there.
This queue is for ladies.

694
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,960
One minute. One minute.

695
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,040
I don't have any problem
to sit with the crowd.

696
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:20,000
I know that you have more
influence in my area than me.

697
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,640
No problem if you want to
make me realize this repeatedly.

698
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,360
Otherwise can we talk
alone for two minutes?

699
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,440
Yes, Mr. Minister.
What do you want from this beggar?

700
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,845
I have heard that you
can read a person's mind.

701
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,040
Now tell me my problem
and its solution?

702
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,160
Actually you can avail
20% Adivasi vote only..

703
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,640
..if the 80% majority
vote is divided.

704
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,920
Not if they are divided
under one name?

705
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,000
What do you mean?

706
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:10,040
I mean the minority ticket
won't work this time..

707
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,280
..because Baba has
united the majority.

708
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,520
The rest you have to decide
if you want to send the..

709
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,040
..documents of this land
of this hermitage or bulldozers.

710
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,240
Come on. Touch my feet.
- What?

711
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,120
The tradition of
the hermitage is that..

712
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,520
..once the meeting is over
the visitor touches my feet.

713
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:45,000
Global baba.
- Hail him.

714
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,080
Global baba.
- Hail him.

715
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,440
Global baba.
- Hail him.

716
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,800
Now I have a request for you too.

717
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:01,760
A government team
will come to survey..

718
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,200
..the land of the hermitage.

719
00:42:05,827 --> 00:42:08,680
Please ask your devotees to enter.

720
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:17,000
You know that no one gives
security amulets without fanfare.

721
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:23,600
Neither global godfather
nor the government. Bye.

722
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:28,080
Global baba.
- Hail him.

723
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,400
Global baba.
- Hail him.

724
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,160
Jacob, you might find it strange.

725
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,600
You come here after passing
difficult IAS-IPS examinations.

726
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,480
And then you have take orders
from these ignorant politicians.

727
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,640
You are underestimating
our democracy, madam.

728
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,120
The way everyone cannot
become IAS or IPS.

729
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,880
In the same way everyone
cannot be a politician either.

730
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,160
And the one whom you
are calling ignorant used to..

731
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,600
..fight for the common man while..

732
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,080
..we were studying for our exams.

733
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,320
So everyone is there because
they are fit to be there.

734
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,920
Why have you become so serious?

735
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,600
No, I am never serious.

736
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,560
I was just thinking
that something is surely..

737
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,400
..special about this
Global baba to have..

738
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,200
..so many followers so soon.

739
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,120
He used to be a criminal, who
was killed in a police encounter.

740
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,760
He would have looked like
this Baba if he was still alive.

741
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,920
What?

742
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,080
Don't misquote me.
No breaking news please.

743
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,560
The city has calmed down
after a long time.

744
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,240
Please allow it to
remain calm. Please.

745
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,760
Come Jacob.
Let's go and meet this Baba once.

746
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,080
Madam, we are bound by some rules.

747
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,560
To stay away from media,
rich people and Babas.

748
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,440
Yes.
- Nice meeting you again.

749
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,480
Same here.
- Bye. Bye.

750
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,520
Bye.

751
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,840
Global baba.
- Hail him.

752
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:49,120
Global baba.
- Hail him.

753
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,000
Global baba.
- Hail him.

754
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,520
Sorry, sorry.
- Global baba. - Hail him.

755
00:43:58,962 --> 00:44:03,760
Global baba.
- Hail him.

756
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,160
Global baba.
- Hail him.

757
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,480
Global baba.
- Hail him.

758
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:24,160
Baba, the children for
whom I have given up everything..

759
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:31,120
..gives me my food today
as if I am bitch at their doorstep.

760
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,680
Baba, you are only one my support.
- Madam, go ahead. Go ahead. Done.

761
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,640
Bless me baba.
- Go ahead.

762
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,232
Go ahead. Go ahead. From here. Go.

763
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:44,240
Baba, my father sold everything
to make me an engineer.

764
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,680
How can I tell him
that I have failed, Baba?

765
00:44:47,922 --> 00:44:51,080
He will die, Baba.
- Go ahead. Go ahead.

766
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,240
Come. Come.

767
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,720
Baba, listen to her problem.

768
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,920
Baba, I am sick of life.

769
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,850
I have been married for
7 years but I am still childless.

770
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,360
My in-laws abuse me as infertile.

771
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,610
Leave me.
- Manu.

772
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,690
What are you doing? Get up.

773
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,720
Pay the rent first,
then you'll get the car keys.

774
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,400
Father, are you okay?

775
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,680
When you will give
us the remaining rent?

776
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,320
Come. Come. Go ahead.

777
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,720
Go ahead. Go ahead.

778
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,120
Baba, today someone
told me that everyone is..

779
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,690
..there in their position
because they deserve to be there.

780
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,160
Take her away.

781
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:41,083
Since then I am thinking,
where am I baba?

782
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,760
I am nowhere, Baba.

783
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,360
I never reached the
place where I wanted to be.

784
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,680
I sold my dreams
for just 17,500, Baba.

785
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,880
Just for 17,500. House rent.

786
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,240
Expenses for father's medicines.

787
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,320
I wanted to study
further but I couldn't.

788
00:46:06,201 --> 00:46:07,600
Is it my mistake?

789
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,840
I wanted to fight my fate.
But I couldn't.

790
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,760
Is it my mistake?

791
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:21,360
Baba, I wish I could show
people what I am capable of.

792
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,280
(Crying)

793
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,640
I wish, baba.

794
00:46:24,147 --> 00:46:25,393
(Crying)

795
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,000
Sir, listen to me.
She is a journalist.

796
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,040
She might be useful to us.

797
00:46:33,107 --> 00:46:35,366
(Crying)

798
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,480
Global baba.
- Hail him.

799
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,560
Bhavna. Hello?

800
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,400
Global baba.
- Hail him.

801
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,400
Bhavna.

802
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,640
Global baba.
- Hail him.

803
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,800
Bhavna. Where are you going?

804
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,480
I need to leave, Baba.
- What happened?

805
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,840
Who have wronged you?

806
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,880
No, Baba. Please let me leave.

807
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,544
I won't let you go.

808
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,800
Global baba.
- Hail him.

809
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,280
Global baba.
- Hail him.

810
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,537
I told you I will
make your life better.

811
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,720
Global Baba wants to meet you. Come.
- No, Baba.

812
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,080
Hello, Baba.
- Yes, disciple.

813
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,160
Baba has called her.

814
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,160
Baba has called her himself.
Come on.

815
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:25,840
No.
- Come.

816
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,040
Come on. Meet the Baba first.

817
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,520
Hail global Baba.

818
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,240
Come.

819
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,480
Come this way.

820
00:48:11,586 --> 00:48:12,738
(Door Opens)

821
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,760
Baba has called her. Go ahead.

822
00:48:21,452 --> 00:48:22,315
(Door Closes)

823
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,800
You can sit wherever
you want, girl.

824
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,280
I am sorry, Baba.
I became too emotional.

825
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,720
You must think that
I am sad and poor.

826
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,440
But it is nothing like that.

827
00:49:09,918 --> 00:49:11,320
The atmosphere was such.

828
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,560
Everyone was sharing their
grief so even I was overwhelmed.

829
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:22,038
You must have seen a few
foreigners amongst my devotees.

830
00:49:28,762 --> 00:49:31,200
And soon their number will grow.

831
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,680
Please sit. Sit.

832
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:39,800
I want someone who can
convey my message to them.

833
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,360
And convey their messages to me.

834
00:49:44,798 --> 00:49:48,440
I think you have knowledge
of foreign languages.

835
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,080
Yes.

836
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:53,640
My devotees outside Kabirganj..

837
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,218
..want to keep in contact
with me at all times.

838
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,080
I have thought to start
a TV channel at their insistence.

839
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,120
What do you think?

840
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,280
It's good.

841
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,040
Will you be able
to manage my channel?

842
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:08,960
What?

843
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,440
You will be paid
3 lakhs a month from..

844
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,440
..the hermitage for this work.

845
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,000
What? Me?
- Yes.

846
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,200
Think about it.

847
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:23,680
If you like my proposal
than come and meet Baba Damroo.

848
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,280
Hail Global Godfather.

849
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,120
Global baba.
- Hail him.

850
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,480
Global baba.
- Hail him.

851
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,800
Global baba.
- Hail him.

852
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,120
Baba, some government
people have come.

853
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,402
Open the gates. Let them come.
- Okay.

854
00:50:58,354 --> 00:51:01,159
(Door Opens)

855
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,360
You will have to deposit
your mobiles, guns, etc. here.

856
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,080
Done.

857
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,160
Yes, done.
- Baba.

858
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,520
I have given them
the Global medicine.

859
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,520
Is it good?
- Yes.

860
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,640
Everything will be fine.
You will become pregnant.

861
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,320
One more.

862
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,480
Global baba.
- Hail him.

863
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,680
Global baba.
- Hail him.

864
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,080
Walk properly.

865
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,440
What is your name?

866
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,880
Sumitra.

867
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,480
No. It's Gopi.

868
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,120
And I am the one
who plays the flute.

869
00:52:42,296 --> 00:52:45,176
(Conch Shell Blowing)

870
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,540
Hail India, sir.

871
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:53,180
This is mine.
- And this is mine.

872
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:56,020
Don't feel embarrassed.
- You are the one feeling shy.

873
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,260
Play fearlessly.

874
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,740
I am master in such game.
- Look. Look at this. Look at this.

875
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:04,620
Sir, you?
- Hail India, sir.

876
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,660
Sir, hello.
- Sir please sit.

877
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,180
Tea. Tea.
- Oh no.

878
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:09,100
Mahender, get some tea.

879
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:10,140
No, nothing.
- Sir, please sit.

880
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,060
Come.

881
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,580
It is an emergency.
- What happened sir?

882
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:14,660
I have to discuss
something important.

883
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:15,820
Sir, please tell us.

884
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,260
Do you remember
Chillum Pehelwan whom..

885
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,500
..we had killed in an encounter?
- Yes.

886
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:22,512
Who identified his body?
- Sir.

887
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,940
We two went to Baliya
and identified his body.

888
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,100
Go and clean there.

889
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,420
Go and play there. Go out. Out.
- Yes.

890
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,420
Are you sure it was Pehelwan's body?

891
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,657
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

892
00:54:32,737 --> 00:54:34,500
He was wearing our handcuffs?

893
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,900
Chain. Bracelets. Rings.

894
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:37,860
Everything belonged to him.

895
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,020
We couldn't make out his face, sir.

896
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,260
I mean the fishes
had eaten his eyes, etc.

897
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,594
We found out that it is
corpse because of the handcuffs.

898
00:54:44,674 --> 00:54:47,657
And it reached Baliya
through the river Ganga.

899
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:52,980
'The stiff was his but
the body was someone else's.'

900
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:00,100
Manu.

901
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,260
No, papa. It's me.

902
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,660
Go to sleep.

903
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,340
Go to sleep.

904
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:25,377
(Coughing)

905
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,220
Give it to me.
It decreases tension, right?

906
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,500
Let me try it too. Give.
- What are you doing? Leave it.

907
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:35,540
I have left it.
This is just... Since morning...

908
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,780
You haven't gone home yet.

909
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,580
This is also our home.

910
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,740
We spend half of the month here.

911
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,140
If papa was operated
on time then ..

912
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,700
..neither we nor he would
have been inconvenienced.

913
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:53,940
Listen.
- Yes.

914
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,300
I have got a huge offer today.

915
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,780
But the people seem
to be very shady.

916
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,460
What? What is the offer?

917
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:05,860
3 lakhs a month.

918
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:08,300
What?
- 3 lakhs.

919
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,780
What are you staring at?

920
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,380
It's working for the channel.
Nothing else.

921
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,343
They can employ Barkha Dutt
or someone..

922
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:20,820
..equivalent to her in this amount.

923
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,540
Why are they paying
you 3 lakh rupees?

924
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:24,660
What do you mean?

925
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,740
What do you mean by that?

926
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,020
I mean..

927
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,059
If I had not shouldered
your responsibility..

928
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:33,020
..then even I would
have Barkha Dutt today.

929
00:56:33,197 --> 00:56:34,180
(Coughing)

930
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:38,300
Too much.
- Bhavna, I didn't mean to say that.

931
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:43,180
I mean to say that if they
are shady then join their gang.

932
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:46,900
And have your doubts
clarified and be Barkha Dutt.

933
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,700
I am there with you.

934
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,180
Have I ever refused you anything?

935
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,580
Hail India, sir.
- Hail India.

936
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:04,012
(Door Closes)

937
00:57:04,092 --> 00:57:06,260
Put up in my office.
- Sir.

938
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,180
Have a seat. Have a seat.

939
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:10,380
Thank you sir.

940
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,860
What happened? Any emergency Jacob?

941
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,020
Sir, I want say
something about Baba...

942
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,980
Start discussing stiff with
the offerings from Global Baba.

943
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:21,870
Take this. You too.
- Thank you.

944
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,700
And this is the protective
amulet from Global Baba.

945
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:28,060
Keep it with you.
It will always protect you.

946
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,908
Ghanshyam.
- So what were you saying, Jacob?

947
00:57:32,988 --> 00:57:36,660
I was feeling unwell since
night so I was thinking..

948
00:57:37,718 --> 00:57:41,100
..if I should take medicines
or these blessings from Baba.

949
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,660
That's it.
- Look.

950
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:48,340
In our country we require
both medicines and prayers.

951
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:49,700
You are right, sir.

952
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,340
Cancel all meetings.
We will do it tomorrow.

953
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,740
But Baba only takes 3-4...
- No problem.

954
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,420
Try to understand. He is a man.

955
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,180
With politics he also
needs something physical...

956
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:02,940
Hello, sir.
- Bhavna, what am I hearing?

957
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:06,380
Are you resigning?
- I am forced sir.

958
00:58:06,686 --> 00:58:10,380
I have told you before
that my salary is not enough.

959
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:14,220
And I said that earn
commissions from ads.

960
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,580
Sir, I am a reporter.

961
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,780
My work is to get news not ads.

962
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,820
Bhavna, elections are approaching.

963
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:25,300
Such talks don't suit you.
Think about PR.

964
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,340
How would be my PR
like in the elections?

965
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,420
Okay? Bye.

966
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,780
Where were you SP?
- Some old case.

967
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:41,620
Hello.
- Okay.

968
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,580
Yes, hello. How are you? Hi.
- Hi.

969
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,100
Don't greet her, sir.
- Why?

970
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:47,340
She is our new sister-in-law.

971
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,140
What?
- Yes.

972
00:58:50,543 --> 00:58:53,100
Good morning, sir.
- Morning. Come, Jacob.

973
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,620
Come and sit. Vivek!
- Yes.

974
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:57,420
Take him away.
- Yes, sir.

975
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:00,660
At one time every house had a cow.

976
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,740
And now they have these.
- Of course sir.

977
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,180
Milk can be also got from outside.

978
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,300
But it is good to
have security inside.

979
00:59:08,659 --> 00:59:10,500
Do you know people here were..

980
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,340
..against your
transfer and promotion?

981
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:21,940
They said that Dallu the
entire state is against lobbying.

982
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,620
In such cases if you
give important positions to..

983
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:31,220
..the ones loyal to Bhanumati,
it will be difficult.

984
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:34,620
Sir, that is problem
with our system.

985
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:40,700
Our condition is like
that of your dumb security.

986
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:43,300
No matter how diligent
we are people consider..

987
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:47,460
..us the dogs of the
one who holds our leash.

988
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:52,220
Though we are only controlled
by the Indian government.

989
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:55,300
Bhanumati also required
me the way you did.

990
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,660
The DM might have sent a report..

991
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,580
..regarding the land of
Global Ashram for verification.

992
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:05,580
I have verified it, sir.

993
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:09,661
They have illegally usurped
that land. It is wrong, sir.

994
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,660
That report is wrong.

995
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:14,900
The DM has sent another report.

996
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:17,540
This report states that
the Global Ashram's land..

997
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:20,380
..is controversy
less and free land.

998
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:23,820
Verify it and send
the enquiring committee.

999
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,420
We will deal with the
remaining formalities.

1000
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:28,580
Sir, now even this file?

1001
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:32,420
This is necessary to continue
with the peace, Jacob.

1002
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:34,540
This is the rule of democracy.

1003
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,140
The one who has the public rules.

1004
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:39,500
Sir, please don't
take any hasty decisions.

1005
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:40,820
I think this hermitage is a scam.

1006
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,900
And global Baba is a bug criminal.
I was about to...

1007
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:50,780
One shouldn't speak out
loud about such specific topics.

1008
01:00:53,105 --> 01:00:55,260
I know that the Baba is a rascal.

1009
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:59,700
And I also know that
because of the Baba..

1010
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,060
..Bhola Pandit was insulted.

1011
01:01:02,788 --> 01:01:05,060
We have got no say here.

1012
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,340
The central defense
minister has come..

1013
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:09,380
..to pay homage in his court.

1014
01:01:09,777 --> 01:01:13,140
Who has come?
- The defense minister. - Right.

1015
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:16,860
I don't know what will
happen to Global Baba later.

1016
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:20,820
But he has global power right now.

1017
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:35,300
Damroo. The hermitage
seems quite different.

1018
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:37,340
Inside it is even more different.
- Really?

1019
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:39,300
Everything has changed.

1020
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,260
Come.
- Who is he?

1021
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:46,020
He is massage Baba.

1022
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,460
Don't touch me. Stay away. Go away.

1023
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:50,900
Please come. - You need to
go with him. Look there. Look there.

1024
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:54,700
Real flying birds. Just
like 'Kill Bill'. Please go ahead.

1025
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:56,180
Go.
- Damroo.

1026
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:58,820
Nobody is there inside.
There no camera inside.

1027
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:00,220
There is no problem.
Full service. Go and enjoy.

1028
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,580
Several people have
been filmed, Damroo.

1029
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:04,700
Nothing doing.
Trust me. Go. The Baba is coming.

1030
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:06,220
Sure?
- Yes. Take him away. Go on.

1031
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:10,740
Take a bath while Baba comes here.
Have fun.

1032
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:20,060
"Sometimes as Ram."

1033
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:22,060
"Sometimes as Shyam."

1034
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:25,740
"Please do come, Mr. Global. Do come."

1035
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:29,740
"Come as a saint."

1036
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:33,340
"Come as a saint."

1037
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:37,340
"With a drum in one hand and
the mighty discus in the other."

1038
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,100
"Please do come, Mr.
Global. Do come."

1039
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:43,660
"Please do come, Mr. Global. Do come."

1040
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:56,420
This is just scorpion.
Is it going to bite me?

1041
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:01,620
How many scorpions
are going to bite me?

1042
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:06,860
Hail Global Godfather.
- Hello Baba.

1043
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:14,420
Hello Baba.

1044
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,900
I was refusing but Damroo
Baba and these girls...

1045
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:22,100
It's good that you have come.
- I had to come.

1046
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:25,980
The contractor of my department
had sung your praises.

1047
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,660
You are responsible for
the security of the people.

1048
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:31,020
So someone needs to take
charge of your security too.

1049
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:34,660
Power is not permanent.

1050
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:38,300
Devotees are coming from
all parts of the world..

1051
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:40,300
..to understand this
game of worldliness.

1052
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:45,980
You should stay here for a few
days in the hermitage's tutelage.

1053
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,420
In the fresh air.
You will feel good.

1054
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:51,780
As you wish, Baba.

1055
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:55,020
Excuse me. This is the long range.

1056
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,447
See this one.
- Excuse me, sir.

1057
01:03:59,020 --> 01:03:59,980
Excuse me.

1058
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:03,300
Look here.
- Oh yes. Nice. Nice Good.

1059
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:05,820
Show more.

1060
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:10,700
This is the long range
one with throw till 500 meters.

1061
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,580
Excuse me, sir.
- What?

1062
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:14,780
Look here.

1063
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:16,340
Nice. Nice. Good.

1064
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:22,820
And another one
is the latest model...

1065
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,540
You like this one?
- ..available only in Italy.

1066
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,980
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

1067
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:33,740
Okay.

1068
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:37,220
You mean something shady
is happening in Global Ashram.

1069
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:39,980
No, I was just asking generally.

1070
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:43,820
What is the value of a
story if one does an expose..

1071
01:04:44,116 --> 01:04:48,349
..on a Baba and his
illegal activities?

1072
01:04:48,429 --> 01:04:51,620
In the current scenario
your story will have zero value.

1073
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:54,500
Because if you tell
anyone that some Baba..

1074
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:57,780
..is a fraud,
a cheat, a con and that..

1075
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:00,100
..sex scandals goes
on in his hermitage..

1076
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:02,900
..or anything obscene
then people will say..

1077
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:05,180
..what's new about it.
This is what happens there.

1078
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,060
But if people know
that Babas are fraud..

1079
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:10,900
..then where do all
these new Babas come from?

1080
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:14,740
Even if they come where do
they get all these new followers?

1081
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,620
Nice, bro.
This can be a better story.

1082
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:20,203
Bhavna, see you. Mr. Minister.
- Mr. Minister.

1083
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:24,020
Come on. Bhavna. Let's go.

1084
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:25,420
Don't you want to take
a bite of the minister?

1085
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,420
Take this. You can take his bite?
- What?

1086
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:31,140
You can also take my
salary from now on from Dallu.

1087
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:35,020
This is wrong.
Stop. I have come here first.

1088
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:39,260
Global Baba had asked me
to meet Damroo Baba.

1089
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:41,140
May I meet him?
- Your name?

1090
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:42,700
Bhavna Sharma.

1091
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:46,580
Damroo Baba, someone called
Bhavna wants to meet you.

1092
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:49,020
I am a journalist.
- She is a journalist.

1093
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:51,700
Pehelwan doesn't have
any record in any station.

1094
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:55,460
And the officers who know him
are silent because of Bhanumati.

1095
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:58,380
Tell them that Bhanumati...

1096
01:05:58,460 --> 01:05:59,820
Who will listen to us, sir?

1097
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:02,853
Bhanumati had not issued
a circular report about him.

1098
01:06:02,933 --> 01:06:06,140
Nor will she.
But we do have a hope.

1099
01:06:06,472 --> 01:06:08,740
We should meet all the
people who are connected..

1100
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:12,460
..to his dealings that we know of.

1101
01:06:12,738 --> 01:06:15,660
We will find some
information or a clue.

1102
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:19,420
Look at this, sir.

1103
01:06:29,741 --> 01:06:30,704
(Gun Firing)

1104
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:32,300
Hey!

1105
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,780
Hey! Catch him.

1106
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:46,180
This is Bhavna,
he corporate head of the channel.

1107
01:06:46,499 --> 01:06:50,140
And if any Baba uses
Global medicine on her..

1108
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:51,860
..then I will kill that rascal.

1109
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,340
She is your global sister.
Who is she?

1110
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:56,244
Global sister.
- Is she only your sister?

1111
01:06:56,466 --> 01:06:57,260
Global sister.

1112
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:58,780
Yes, very good! Go now. Move on.

1113
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,860
Global Baba.
- Hail him.

1114
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:02,060
Come Bhavna. - Global Baba.
- Hail him.

1115
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:04,100
Global Baba.
- Hail him.

1116
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:06,500
Bhavna, they all are devotees.

1117
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:10,380
Bhavna, when I saw
you for the first time..

1118
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,900
..I felt that we will
make a very good pair.

1119
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:17,740
Just like ice-cream.
- Baba.

1120
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:18,340
Yes.

1121
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:20,729
I have come here to set your channel.
- Yes.

1122
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:23,700
Not ice cream.
- May I address you casually?

1123
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:26,180
Yes.
- You are acting so hard to get.

1124
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:27,260
I have done so much for you and..

1125
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:28,780
..you are not even
flirting with me.

1126
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:33,620
Thank Mr. Damroo,
for doing so much for me.

1127
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:36,340
I want to say I love you to you..

1128
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,466
..and you are making fun of me.

1129
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:41,500
Your voice is not old enough yet.

1130
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:43,420
Let it become stronger.

1131
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,460
Look Bhavna.
- Baba Damroo.

1132
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,300
I am hurt.

1133
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:56,740
Hail Global Baba.

1134
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:01,060
Dallu has sent a message.

1135
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:04,460
He said that he will
resolve our land issue..

1136
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:07,220
..if we are ready
to bless him publicly.

1137
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:09,240
Then sir you should bless him.

1138
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,500
Grahan has seen a few more plots.

1139
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:13,060
Global college. Global hospital.

1140
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:14,380
We will make a global town.

1141
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:17,860
Where did this Grahan Baba
come from?

1142
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:20,300
He is our minion. Land mafia.

1143
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:22,180
A champion in usurping land.

1144
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:25,700
And what were you doing
with this girl from the channel?

1145
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:28,660
Sir, you saw. It was nothing.

1146
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:30,540
I was just explaining her the work.

1147
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,900
You dumb person you
were teaching her work.

1148
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:34,700
Or flirting with her?

1149
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,387
A new lot of bar dancers
are coming from Mumbai.

1150
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:41,018
We have to export them
to Dubai with a Yoga camp.

1151
01:08:41,098 --> 01:08:42,060
What will you do then?

1152
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:46,020
If the sweet seller
eats all of his sweets..

1153
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,731
..then what will he sell?

1154
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:51,860
Sir, this is our personal sweet.

1155
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,977
Tel me, if you want to have
it alone. I will do the rest.

1156
01:08:55,539 --> 01:08:59,252
You will arrange a girl for me?
I will fix you.

1157
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:02,460
I haven't taught you a lesson
since several days. - Sorry.

1158
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:05,780
Be careful.
Otherwise you might end up dead.

1159
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:08,860
Go and find the
history of that girl.

1160
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:11,221
And tell Dallu that
I coming to meet him. Go.

1161
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:13,820
Global Baba.
- Hail him.

1162
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:18,620
Global Baba.
- Hail him.

1163
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:30,580
Global Baba.
- Hail him.

1164
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:35,020
Global Baba.
- Hail him.

1165
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,500
Power Baba.
- Hail him.

1166
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:39,380
Who is Power Baba?

1167
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:41,220
Power Baba.
- Hail him.

1168
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:48,100
Isn't this the title you
are going to give me, Baba?

1169
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:52,380
I have dispatched the
lease papers to the hermitage.

1170
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:56,940
Now please fulfill
the rest of the deal.

1171
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:01,655
And announce our union.
Everyone is waiting.

1172
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:03,610
Come. Come.

1173
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:08,300
Here is the channel
head of our hermitage. Come.

1174
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:11,300
You?
- She was in your team till now.

1175
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:13,314
Now she is with us.
- Start.

1176
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:17,660
Power Baba.
- Hail him.

1177
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:24,580
Power Baba.
- Hail him.

1178
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:30,900
Dallu please tell us that the
land on which the Global Ashram..

1179
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:33,060
..stands which belonged
to the Adivasi has..

1180
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:35,780
..suddenly been declared
as infertile land.

1181
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:38,260
Are you able to digest
this fact properly?

1182
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:45,240
The one who cannot
digest can contact Baba.

1183
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:51,300
Baba has got a lot of
exercises to treat indigestion.

1184
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:54,820
So Baba, what lesson have
you imparted to Dallu that..

1185
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:57,140
..he became Power Baba
from a powerless home minister?

1186
01:10:57,899 --> 01:11:00,460
I have only taught him
to respect public opinion.

1187
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:06,260
And Baba said that Dallu
because of your dedication..

1188
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:12,220
..to public service me
and all my devotees will..

1189
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:14,820
..support you in
the coming elections.

1190
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:18,780
Is that true, Baba?
Baba, tell us. Please speak.

1191
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:21,740
Do you agree to this? Is he right?
- Yes, he is right.

1192
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:26,780
I have no doubts towards his
industry towards public service.

1193
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:29,340
And that's why he has
promised to allow us..

1194
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:31,140
..government land
to make Global hospital..

1195
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:34,140
..Global school and Global College.

1196
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:36,180
Dallu, what does that mean?
- (Clap Sound)

1197
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:37,620
Does that mean
you will only serve..

1198
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,900
Global Baba and his devotees?

1199
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:41,700
What about the rest?
- What about the rest?

1200
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:45,340
There is nothing else, child.
The rest is your illusion.

1201
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:48,201
Baba. Baba.
One more question. Dallu.

1202
01:11:48,281 --> 01:11:49,007
(Multiple Reporters Talking At Once)

1203
01:11:49,087 --> 01:11:52,780
A lot is still left, Baba.

1204
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:55,700
You might even know
and recognize him.

1205
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:59,660
Greetings. They greet Babas, right?

1206
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:01,820
It is about how you
feel about them, child.

1207
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:05,580
You have got a long life.
- God has been kind to me.

1208
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:12,060
I will pray that you
have a long life too.

1209
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:18,900
Global Baba.
- Hail him.

1210
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:21,700
Please Damroo. Please. No.
- Come. I will drop you.

1211
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:24,740
What?
- I will drop you home. Come on sit.

1212
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:26,940
No, Damroo.
I will go by myself. Please.

1213
01:12:27,143 --> 01:12:28,580
What are you saying?

1214
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:31,420
I will also meet your
family and come even closer.

1215
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:32,820
Come. Come. Come.
- Look, Damroo.

1216
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:35,340
I don't like mixing my
personal and professional life.

1217
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:36,780
So please just let me go.

1218
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:37,940
What are you saying?

1219
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:40,540
There are no secrets between us.

1220
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:42,220
The closer you come, the more fun it'll be.
- What are you doing, Damroo?

1221
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:43,220
Let me go.
- Come with me.

1222
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:45,420
Damroo.
- Hey. What is the problem?

1223
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:47,820
This is our personal problem.
Get lost.

1224
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:52,020
Let me go.
- Every matter on the road is personal.

1225
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:55,860
Sir, she is a member of
our family in the hermitage.

1226
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:58,820
So I am dropping her home.
Do you have any problem?

1227
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:01,140
Not I but you will have a problem.

1228
01:13:01,763 --> 01:13:04,220
It will be better if the dirt
of the hermitage stays within it.

1229
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:09,220
If it becomes public then
Babas like you will be in problems.

1230
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:12,220
Look down. Look down!

1231
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:18,020
Do you know how police
looks after their guests?

1232
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:19,460
Do you know it or not?

1233
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:24,340
Don't worry about the girl.
Think about yourself. Go.

1234
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:26,100
Go.

1235
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:30,140
Shall I?
- Go from here.

1236
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:36,427
Start the car.
Okay, Bye. Take care of her. Bye.

1237
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:40,460
For how much did you
sell your self-respect..

1238
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:41,740
..for to these Babas?

1239
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:46,620
So you will do the same
thing Damroo Baba was doing.

1240
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:48,900
Embarrass me.

1241
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:50,620
Either you are very innocent..

1242
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:52,860
..who doesn't understand
their ulterior motives.

1243
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,700
You understand them,
don't you Jacob?

1244
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:55,900
What are you doing?

1245
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:58,580
At least I am not working
for those rascals.

1246
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:00,997
If not these rascals.

1247
01:14:01,077 --> 01:14:02,620
Then you must be working
for some other rascals.

1248
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:05,260
Are there any other people in
this world besides these rascals?

1249
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:09,500
Everyone wants something here.

1250
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,620
And only for themselves.
Let the world go to hell.

1251
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:15,460
This is the global
weakness of the people.

1252
01:14:15,979 --> 01:14:20,340
The one who cashes on it has
their governments and hermitages.

1253
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:22,180
So only we are left.

1254
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:24,300
People like us have
got only two options.

1255
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:27,340
To work for these
government people like you.

1256
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,740
Or work for these Holy men like me.

1257
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:32,180
And hope to keep
our self-respect intact.

1258
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:35,100
Wow!

1259
01:14:35,699 --> 01:14:37,460
It seems you have started
on a great mission..

1260
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:39,540
..with complete preparations.

1261
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:42,380
Someone might be in
some place maybe because..

1262
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:44,460
..he is able to
fight only from there.

1263
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:47,340
Having different fighting
grounds doesn't mean..

1264
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:49,100
..that we should
have different enemies.

1265
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:56,060
'You must know and recognize them.'

1266
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:02,580
'Greetings.
They greet Babas, right?'

1267
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:07,420
'You have got a long life.'

1268
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:23,900
Sir. What happened?

1269
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,980
How many 302 Babas do
we have in our hermitage?

1270
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:29,300
Several, sir.

1271
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:32,674
Tell them that they
need to be careful.

1272
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,740
"Intoxicated eyes."

1273
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:00,300
"Sweet talks."

1274
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:03,300
"Buzzing like the bees."

1275
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:09,140
"The spring I was
waiting for has come."

1276
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:16,180
"The heart feels naughty,
says the wet blouse."

1277
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:21,900
"Boys follow you in groups."

1278
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:28,580
"Colors blow into
your face girl on Holi."

1279
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:32,580
"No matter how much you try,
I won't respond."

1280
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:35,020
"Go away, boy."

1281
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:41,180
"Colors blow into
your face girl on Holi."

1282
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:45,380
"No matter how much you try,
I won't respond."

1283
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:47,620
"Go away, boy."

1284
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:21,380
"With opium and
dancing with devotees."

1285
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:27,420
"The eyes are now free.
And he is having fun."

1286
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:34,140
"Colors are being showered.
Get wet."

1287
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:37,380
"The ascetic is
immersed in colors."

1288
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:39,940
"He is looking for his partner."

1289
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:46,500
"Colors blow into
your face girl on Holi."

1290
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:50,380
"No matter how much you try,
I won't respond."

1291
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:52,940
"Go away, boy."

1292
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:55,980
"The colors are rough.
Red water is being showered."

1293
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:59,180
"Look at all this red stuff."

1294
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:02,340
"What is this mystery?
Where are hiding? They know it."

1295
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:05,540
"In Holi everyone
is playing around."

1296
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:07,100
"A death dance is going on."

1297
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:08,700
"Such a web has been woven."

1298
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:10,260
"Blood is strewn everywhere."

1299
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:11,860
"The land has become red."

1300
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:21,096
(Door Closes)

1301
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:28,620
Chauhan, call the fire
brigade and ambulance.

1302
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:40,260
How will you reach
such a cunning person?

1303
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:44,140
He has removed all
traces for us to reach him.

1304
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:46,460
You are removing old evidences.

1305
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:48,812
But you are creating new evidences.

1306
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:52,796
I felt that you have understood..

1307
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:54,599
..that no one catch me.

1308
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:57,180
Wearing a saffron garb
doesn't make one God.

1309
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:02,340
You are still the same
person for me like before.

1310
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:07,220
Times have changed a lot, Jacob.

1311
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:09,116
Before I was someone's dog.

1312
01:19:09,196 --> 01:19:11,540
But today I have so many
dogs that if I set them..

1313
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:13,820
..after you then you
won't have anywhere to run.

1314
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:15,980
Pehelwan you should
be thinking of running away.

1315
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:19,220
The day I will get
one evidence against you..

1316
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,420
..I will kill you in
front of the same people..

1317
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,620
..who had made you God.
Remember that.

1318
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:25,940
Don't make this enmity
personal, Jacob.

1319
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:28,260
You will regret.

1320
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:32,980
No warrior can hurt
any Baba in India.

1321
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,540
If this matter advances that..

1322
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:42,300
..the animal which is eaten by your
community is worshipped by mine.

1323
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:46,340
Do you even realize
how many people will die..

1324
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:49,340
..form both communities
if war starts?

1325
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,020
Go Jacob.

1326
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:55,980
That day you had given
me a chance to run.

1327
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:59,060
I will look away today.

1328
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:01,580
Go out of the hermitage
with full respect.

1329
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,380
Consider that the death
sentence on your head..

1330
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:05,500
..has been waived off.

1331
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:09,380
Global Baba.
- Hail him.

1332
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:12,420
Baba, I am sick of
the quarrels at my home.

1333
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:14,220
Before we used to
have a joint family.

1334
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:15,820
We used to live together.

1335
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:18,060
And then my mother-in-law
had it partitioned.

1336
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:22,860
And since then quarrels
have never stopped.

1337
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,060
What do you wipe your house with?

1338
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:28,900
It is an old pajama of my husband.

1339
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:30,660
That is the root
of all your problems.

1340
01:20:30,979 --> 01:20:32,420
Change that cloth and make a wipe..

1341
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,940
..out of your
mother-in-law's petticoat.

1342
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:36,260
Soon you will be globally blessed.

1343
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:40,300
Gudiya, go and check what
cloth do we use to wipe our house?

1344
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:41,180
Yes.

1345
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:45,420
It is very important for
women to know their limits.

1346
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:47,900
If you cross your limits then..

1347
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:50,580
..the devils outside will nab you.

1348
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:56,540
This rape etc. is happening
because of a woman's lust.

1349
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:59,660
If women can control
their lust... Stop!

1350
01:21:01,298 --> 01:21:02,660
Who wrote this bad discourse?

1351
01:21:06,139 --> 01:21:07,531
Me.
- You?

1352
01:21:08,978 --> 01:21:09,980
What do you want me to do?

1353
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:12,420
Do you want me to be
in trouble by saying all this?

1354
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:15,860
Baba how will be in the news
if you don't make controversies?

1355
01:21:16,552 --> 01:21:19,140
Such statements give
you free publicity worth..

1356
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,420
..millions in twitter,
Facebook etc.

1357
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:24,020
I will write it if you
just want to say good things.

1358
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:26,180
But nobody pays
attention to such things.

1359
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:28,460
Is it?

1360
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:32,460
But the youth today
doesn't understand things..

1361
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:34,940
..like emotions,
control, limits, etc.

1362
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,500
And I am only targeting the youth.

1363
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:40,660
Please change this speech.
- Yes.

1364
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:41,540
Baba, phone.

1365
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:45,140
Who is calling?
- An international devotee.

1366
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:46,420
Hello?

1367
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:48,780
Hello?

1368
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:54,140
Yes. Oh yes.

1369
01:21:55,138 --> 01:21:58,860
Oh yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

1370
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:02,460
Did you record it?
- Yes.

1371
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:05,020
Bhavna.
- Yes, Baba.

1372
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,740
A devotee from France
was speaking in German.

1373
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:12,100
Please find out what he is saying.
It is recorded.

1374
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:14,127
Yes.
- Be careful with that.

1375
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:15,885
Come here.

1376
01:22:18,473 --> 01:22:20,900
Sir, this girl is not trustworthy.

1377
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:22,358
Don't let her come too close.
- Why?

1378
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:23,340
Nothing.

1379
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:25,340
I also got trapped with
the police once because of her.

1380
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:26,860
I asked her to sit
in the car but she didn't..

1381
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:27,780
..and created a scene.

1382
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:29,740
The policeman came
and threatened me.

1383
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,100
And she didn't even defend me, sir.

1384
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:33,555
This girl is not trustworthy.

1385
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:36,180
You guaranteed the trustworthiness
of this girl, right?

1386
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:39,100
And now you are suspecting her.

1387
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:45,020
Who is untrustworthy?
This girl or you?

1388
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:48,100
No, sir. She has a good heart.
I can read faces.

1389
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:52,199
But she is under pressure.
- Mad man.

1390
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,820
Are you going to tell
me if she is under pressure?

1391
01:22:56,860 --> 01:22:59,060
Her father is in the
hospital for the last 7 years.

1392
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:01,260
Her brother is in
rehab for drug abuse.

1393
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:03,660
Sir, you have got her bio data.

1394
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:05,780
I was about to find all that.
- When?

1395
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:07,580
After it was too late.

1396
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:10,900
Go and manage your loose change.

1397
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:13,500
You cannot manager her. Go.

1398
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,780
How are you pervert Baba?

1399
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:20,627
Pervert Baba.
- Witch.

1400
01:23:23,025 --> 01:23:26,860
Pervert Baba.
- Sir, they are from Mumbai.

1401
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:28,780
They are taking advantage
of me since I was nice to them.

1402
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:31,940
Once there deal is done
tomorrow I will be free.

1403
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:35,220
Everyone is calling me
pervert because of them.

1404
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:36,536
I am feeling very bad.

1405
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:42,060
Jacob, what do I do with this Baba?

1406
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:47,297
He sends a new proposal
for land every day to approve.

1407
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:54,540
And if do approve it
I will be jailed for sure.

1408
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:59,540
And if I don't approve it
then I will lose the elections.

1409
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:03,220
Sir, I don't know about
the elections but if you want..

1410
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:07,345
..to overpower the Baba
then there is one person..

1411
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:13,100
..in this state who can do this.
- Who?

1412
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:19,100
The one who has Baba's
entire horoscope.

1413
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:21,060
Sir, I will arrange the meeting.

1414
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:25,137
It is your job to call Baba.

1415
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:35,900
Come Baba. Come.

1416
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:39,740
Why is your Dally Yadav
such a big politician?

1417
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:41,140
It is a matter of a small land.

1418
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:44,590
It is not a deal for illegal
cocaine to call this secret meeting.

1419
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:47,540
It is not that, Baba.
The elections are coming.

1420
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:50,620
The press is tracking him
like vultures.

1421
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:53,420
Both Dallu and you
will be in trouble..

1422
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:56,740
..if this deal is made public.

1423
01:24:56,820 --> 01:25:00,060
Child, my hermitage is
founded on all these problems.

1424
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:02,900
So don't try to impart
knowledge to me.

1425
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:09,500
Baba. Baba.
it will be better if you go alone.

1426
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:13,940
I am waiting him.
He has come. Greetings, Baba.

1427
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:16,100
I had thought that
you had arranged..

1428
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:18,500
..a great press
conference like last time.

1429
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:24,420
That conference made
me realize of your activities.

1430
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:26,780
You made me bend
so low at your feet..

1431
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:29,100
..that my waist is still sprained.

1432
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:45,484
Bhanumati.

1433
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:47,780
Bhanumati? And here? - (Door Closes)

1434
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:59,500
Hey. Don't call anyone.

1435
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:03,620
When a person is
scared what does he say?

1436
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:06,300
Hello.
- How are you, Dallu?

1437
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:08,460
I am fine. Please have a seat.

1438
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:15,700
All right. So you are Global Baba.

1439
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:22,081
I have heard a lot about you.
Please sit.

1440
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:24,020
Why are you standing?

1441
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:28,900
I have sent you a personal request.

1442
01:26:30,379 --> 01:26:32,220
Yes, Mr. Mishra told me about it.

1443
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:34,980
Yes.
- I am thinking about it.

1444
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:39,380
Dallu, can you leave us
alone for some time.

1445
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:41,700
I have somehow found time
to meet Baba.

1446
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:42,740
Why not.

1447
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:44,220
If you...
- Okay, bye.

1448
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:53,660
Baba, I wanted to listen
to some discourse by you.

1449
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:56,620
But what can I do?
Elections are approaching.

1450
01:26:56,858 --> 01:26:58,780
I have to finalize
the list of the candidates.

1451
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:02,740
We have promised to have
a crime free government this time.

1452
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:05,540
Isn't that a good promise?

1453
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:10,780
Now I don't have time
to take your wisdom.

1454
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:13,900
So I thought of giving
you some wisdom.

1455
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:17,540
The hermitage you
have in Kabirganj.

1456
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:22,020
The minority communities
are very angry about it.

1457
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:24,340
They don't have much
land left for them.

1458
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:27,980
What will they do if
you take that away too?

1459
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:33,220
So I want you to clear off
from that place..

1460
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:36,860
..with that shame
of a hermitage of yours.

1461
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:40,860
In fact it is better
if you leave this state..

1462
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:43,380
..and start your game
in some other state.

1463
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:45,620
Tell me,
if you have any problem here?

1464
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:47,860
I have got millions
of devotees today.

1465
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:50,100
They might get disappointed.

1466
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:52,860
What will I tell them when
they ask me where I am going?

1467
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,620
Tell them that you
had an inner calling...

1468
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:56,740
One minute. One minute.

1469
01:27:56,820 --> 01:27:59,500
If you don't mind than
I will record your message.

1470
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:00,500
What do you mean?

1471
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:02,500
Just a minute. Give me a minute.

1472
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:08,292
Who is Damroo Baba?
- Me.

1473
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:11,860
You have been called inside.
- May I? - Yes.

1474
01:28:14,793 --> 01:28:16,245
(Door Opens)

1475
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:18,340
Global Baba. - Close the door
and take out the mobile fast.

1476
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:20,180
We need to record
Bhanumati's video.

1477
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:22,100
What is this drama all about?

1478
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:24,500
These are just 4 lines.
Just write it down.

1479
01:28:24,580 --> 01:28:26,740
No. It is not enough
for us to write it down.

1480
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:28,220
We need to record it.

1481
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:31,700
Don't take my video.
Take his. Your boss.

1482
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:32,820
You need to take his recording.

1483
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:35,460
I get recorded often.
You should have one now.

1484
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:37,460
What do you mean?
- Talk about wisdom.

1485
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:38,980
Wisdom.

1486
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,260
Have you lost your mind?

1487
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:43,980
When this cat says
wisdom you can hear it.

1488
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:45,660
Have you lost your mind?

1489
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:48,220
Say wisdom. Wisdom.
- Behave properly.

1490
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:51,460
Chillum, have you gone crazy?

1491
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:55,540
Do you know your standing? My dog...

1492
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:03,249
Why have he called him inside?

1493
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:09,460
Sometimes we have
such co-incidence..

1494
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:11,245
..that it really
feels that God exists.

1495
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:13,940
I had never thought that
I will get such an easy..

1496
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:16,130
..chance to take my revenge on her.

1497
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:18,446
Look. Why are you struggling?

1498
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:32,900
She is resting for some time.

1499
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:35,543
She said she doesn't
want to be disturbed.

1500
01:29:39,059 --> 01:29:40,131
Car.

1501
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:45,420
Hello?

1502
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,460
We have received a
shocking news regarding..

1503
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:49,340
..the state assembly elections.

1504
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:51,580
Bhanumati has
selected Global Baba..

1505
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:54,060
..as the candidate from
the Kabirganj constituency.

1506
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:55,980
Dallu Yadav have lost hope..

1507
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:58,380
..after the advent of Global Baba.
- I call you later.

1508
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:00,220
Bhanumati has
announced Global Baba..

1509
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:01,940
..as the candidate from
the Kabirganj her party.

1510
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:03,260
"Sometimes as Ram."

1511
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:05,180
"Sometimes as Shyam."

1512
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:08,380
"Come Global. Do come."

1513
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:09,820
Hello, Mr.
Minister. Hello, Mr. Minister.

1514
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:13,140
Mr. Minister, I am shocked
as to why Bhanumati did this.

1515
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:14,980
There was no logical
reason for this.

1516
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:16,620
Who is this?

1517
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,100
Hail Global Godfather.

1518
01:30:19,658 --> 01:30:21,700
Where did you get this number from?

1519
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:23,060
I know everything.

1520
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:27,500
I also know that
Bhanumati's favorite dog..

1521
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:29,420
..Jacob is also there with you.

1522
01:30:29,836 --> 01:30:34,740
And it is good to say
that you have hurt yourself.

1523
01:30:35,052 --> 01:30:36,900
(Laughing)

1524
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:39,860
Did you call me to make fun of me?

1525
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:44,060
I am calling you to say thanks.

1526
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:48,820
You had arranged such
a good meeting with Bhanumati.

1527
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:50,140
It was fun.

1528
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:52,700
Continue to send such good gifts..

1529
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:54,300
..to me in the future too.

1530
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:56,980
I don't like small gifts.

1531
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:58,563
(Laughing)

1532
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:02,580
Excuse me ma'am.

1533
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:05,180
I just spoke with
media head, Gupta.

1534
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:08,362
He says that since the
time we have added Global Baba..

1535
01:31:08,442 --> 01:31:12,500
..to our party since
then upper class people..

1536
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:15,140
..from the Eastern region
are also joining the party.

1537
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:16,820
Congratulations.

1538
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:24,260
So what is all this wrong Hindi?

1539
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:25,700
Why don't you check?
What do you want?

1540
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:27,700
That I should fail before
I even become a minister.

1541
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,100
I am sorry, Baba. I don't know how...

1542
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:30,620
Where is Nepali Baba. Call him.

1543
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:32,180
He will be my election in-charge.

1544
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:33,020
He has to start my promotion.

1545
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:35,020
Why do you need Nepali Baba?
I am there.

1546
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:37,380
Your PA. I will manage everything.

1547
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:41,922
No minister's PA
speaks with a slur.

1548
01:31:42,002 --> 01:31:42,900
(Laughing)

1549
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:44,340
Take care of them. That suits you.

1550
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:47,700
"Hail. Hail. Hail Baba."

1551
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:49,660
This time.
- Baba's government.

1552
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:51,740
This time.
- Baba's government.

1553
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:53,900
This time.
- Baba's government.

1554
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:59,140
I have joined politics
so that I can bring..

1555
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:00,900
..back all the black
money deposited abroad.

1556
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:06,220
So that our India become
a shining golden bird again.

1557
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:11,020
I am forced to delve
in dirty politics..

1558
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:15,260
..so that I can get rid
of other corrupted politicians.

1559
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:16,860
Global Baba.
- Hail him.

1560
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:19,180
Their income is in
international banks.

1561
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:22,020
Then why is our income taxed?

1562
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:24,780
If you want to save
the heritage of India..

1563
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:29,660
..then you have to get the
good and true ascetics to power.

1564
01:32:29,740 --> 01:32:31,940
The glorious future
of our country depends..

1565
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:35,980
..on the inclusion of
Global Ashram in the assembly.

1566
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:38,100
Global Baba.
- Hail him.

1567
01:32:38,180 --> 01:32:39,020
51% seats.

1568
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:40,860
That means Global Baba has got..

1569
01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:42,460
..51% support from the public.

1570
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:46,420
Dallu Yadav is getting 34% support.

1571
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:49,940
And the others are
getting 15% support.

1572
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:51,420
Uncle.
- Yes.

1573
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:52,220
Offerings.

1574
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:54,460
Call Bhavna.

1575
01:32:56,780 --> 01:33:00,660
Tell her that it is time
to expose the Baba. - Yes.

1576
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:04,020
Sir, if you don't
mind may I say something?

1577
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:06,540
Don't involve her
in this matter, sir.

1578
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:09,340
Because Bhavna cannot
handle this matter.

1579
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:11,217
Trust me.
- Shut up.

1580
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:14,740
I am in this situation
because of this.

1581
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:17,860
Global 51% and Dallu Yadav 34%.

1582
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:21,660
It seems that I haven't
done politics for 40 years.

1583
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:26,340
What the heck.
- One minute. Sir, Bhavna.

1584
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:32,980
Hello, Bhavna.

1585
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:37,060
Hello.
- Bless you. Bless you. How is papa?

1586
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:41,140
Listen. Do one thing, dear.

1587
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:08,140
He will win.
- Global Baba will win.

1588
01:34:08,220 --> 01:34:13,940
He will win.
- Global Baba will win.

1589
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:17,300
He will win.
- Global Baba will win.

1590
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:20,940
He will win.
- Global Baba will win.

1591
01:34:22,578 --> 01:34:26,300
Dallu Yadav.
- Hail him.

1592
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:30,220
Dallu Yadav.
- Hail him.

1593
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:50,860
The Baba will be exposed soon.

1594
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:53,900
The power of truth...

1595
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:06,100
Go. Go. Go.

1596
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:10,180
What are you hiding? Show. Check.

1597
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:17,660
Baba.
- Yes. Tell me, girl.

1598
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:19,260
I am listening to you.

1599
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:21,180
Baba, I have a request for you.

1600
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:23,580
It would be very kind
of you if you allow me..

1601
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:26,860
..to go by the green channel
after duty.

1602
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:30,460
Do you want to take something
outside the hermitage?

1603
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:31,900
By stealth.

1604
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:35,260
Yes. My honor.

1605
01:35:35,740 --> 01:35:39,060
The Baba's frisk very
indecently at the gates.

1606
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:41,260
I don't like it.

1607
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:53,020
Good girls are not always smart.

1608
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:56,500
Smart girls are not always good.

1609
01:35:57,007 --> 01:36:00,140
And the one who are
both are not beautiful.

1610
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:04,900
And the one who is
beautiful is not a girl.

1611
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:10,180
You are uniquely endowed
with all these qualities.

1612
01:36:10,684 --> 01:36:12,660
I don't understand.

1613
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:17,167
You have gone against me
for that lowly Dally Yadav.

1614
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:19,380
Why?

1615
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:22,340
Oh no, Baba. You misunderstand.

1616
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:37,620
It's a waste of time
and words when two..

1617
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:40,820
..smart people try
to fool each other.

1618
01:36:41,483 --> 01:36:43,980
You wanted to have
your father operated on..

1619
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:47,020
..for the last 5 years
who was rotting in the hospital.

1620
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:48,580
He got operated on 2 days ago.

1621
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:49,700
Where did the money come from?

1622
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:51,300
The hermitage didn't pay it.

1623
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:53,220
Are you going to tell me yourself?

1624
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:55,500
Or should I show
you the bank statements?

1625
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:11,700
Dallu Yadav wants to expose me
with your help today.

1626
01:37:11,923 --> 01:37:13,300
No.

1627
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:17,660
The way you have made videos
of this entire hermitage.

1628
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:21,380
You want to give that to him, right?
- No. No.

1629
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:23,980
Tell me the truth.
- No. - Tell me.

1630
01:37:24,340 --> 01:37:29,740
What is this?
- This contains the real stuff.

1631
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:31,460
Right?

1632
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:33,100
Sorry, Baba.

1633
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:35,580
You will work at the Baba's.

1634
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:36,660
What?

1635
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:37,780
For me.

1636
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:40,980
Don't forget that your father
is at the government hospital.

1637
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:44,903
And I am the government.

1638
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:47,420
Sorry Baba.

1639
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:51,500
I have to finish the work
I have started. Munna.

1640
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:58,500
What does this have?

1641
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:03,580
He is looking for this.
Take it to Dallu Yadav.

1642
01:38:03,660 --> 01:38:06,300
Please Baba. Please.
- Please. Please. Please.

1643
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:08,300
Please Baba.
- Look.

1644
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:14,180
Mannu.

1645
01:38:15,740 --> 01:38:17,380
No Baba. Please let him go.

1646
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:19,660
Baba, please.
I haven't done anything.

1647
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:22,420
Your bother will be freed as
soon as your work is done. - (Crying)

1648
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:24,220
My brother.
- Munna. - Yes.

1649
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:26,780
Take madam out through
the green channel.

1650
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:29,620
I haven't done anything.
- Her wish should be granted. Go.

1651
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:32,900
Please Baba. Let him go. Please.

1652
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:41,060
"The Baba is a pervert."

1653
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:45,380
"The Baba is a pervert."

1654
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:49,940
"The Baba is a pervert."

1655
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:52,940
"Give it up.
Give it up to the bad boy."

1656
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:54,980
"Give it up.
Give it up to the bad boy."

1657
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:57,340
"He is a pervert."

1658
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:59,500
"He is a pervert
just like a monkey."

1659
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:01,740
"He is a pervert."

1660
01:39:01,820 --> 01:39:03,820
"He is a pervert
just like a monkey."

1661
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:08,420
"Pervert Baba."

1662
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:10,540
Come.

1663
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:13,540
Look exchange...

1664
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:16,580
Munna.
- What is it?

1665
01:39:17,020 --> 01:39:18,140
Stop.

1666
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:23,660
My dress.

1667
01:39:27,620 --> 01:39:28,740
Come. Come on.

1668
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:31,700
Nepali.

1669
01:39:33,580 --> 01:39:36,020
That girl won't take
the green gate. Get inside.

1670
01:39:36,928 --> 01:39:40,660
Get lost.
The Baba has told me. Get lost. Go.

1671
01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:45,100
"The Baba has a simple theory."

1672
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:47,260
"He tales god's name
and keeps a girl by his side."

1673
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:49,780
"A little property everywhere."

1674
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:51,420
"A little hope. And a little life."

1675
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:53,180
I am calling here but I
am not able to get through to her.

1676
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:55,580
What are you saying?
- She must be on her way.

1677
01:39:56,740 --> 01:40:00,900
"The Baba is a pervert."

1678
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:18,780
Move. Move.
Go away. Get lost. Move.

1679
01:40:18,860 --> 01:40:20,420
What drama is going on here?

1680
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:28,260
Nepali went through the
green channel with that girl.

1681
01:40:28,340 --> 01:40:29,980
When I told him to stop
he said you had told him to.

1682
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:32,580
Yes, I have. What's the problem?

1683
01:40:33,140 --> 01:40:34,540
Sir, why don't you understand?

1684
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:36,860
That girl is not trustworthy.

1685
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:38,762
I keep a special eye on her.

1686
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:43,924
Special eye!
Where? On her lips or her cheeks?

1687
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:45,860
What rubbish!

1688
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,380
If I had not kept an eye on you..

1689
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:50,900
..then we would have
been ruined by now.

1690
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:52,780
Now stop thinking about that girl..

1691
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:54,300
..and keep a watch at the gate.

1692
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:55,500
You are only fit for that.

1693
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:57,700
And let Munna do his job. Get lost.

1694
01:40:57,940 --> 01:41:02,220
Sir, you have given
that Nepali my uniform.

1695
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:04,260
He was teasing me by wearing it.

1696
01:41:04,740 --> 01:41:06,900
And you are having fruits alone.

1697
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:08,660
What is wrong with you sir?

1698
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:10,500
What are you hiding from me?
Tell me.

1699
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:14,655
Are you my wife that
I am answerable to you?

1700
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:18,380
Get lost otherwise if I lose my head...
- Don't do that.

1701
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:21,420
Get lost. Out.

1702
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:26,180
"Venerate the mind."

1703
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:28,300
"And the fragrance of incense."

1704
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:32,860
"The one who touches the
loving heart is being blessed."

1705
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:37,740
"He looks at the place
where your stole gives away."

1706
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:43,380
"The Baba is a pervert."

1707
01:41:43,820 --> 01:41:46,500
Yes, Baba.
I am about to reach. Yes.

1708
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:48,407
I will keep you updated, Baba.

1709
01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:52,740
Yes, everything will be fine.
Don't worry.

1710
01:41:56,340 --> 01:41:57,700
Global greetings.
- Move.

1711
01:42:03,340 --> 01:42:05,180
One minute, Baba.

1712
01:42:08,020 --> 01:42:10,958
Baba, Damroo is calling. Yes?

1713
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:12,820
Where have you gone with Bhavna?

1714
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:15,037
Why do you want to know about it?

1715
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:16,778
Mind your own business.

1716
01:42:16,858 --> 01:42:19,660
It is Damroo.
Damroo Baba. Tell me, what is it?

1717
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:21,820
I am on hotline with Baba.
Hang up now.

1718
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:24,100
The one you think
as Baba was a criminal.

1719
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:27,300
Small time criminal.
He was shot at. I saved him.

1720
01:42:27,380 --> 01:42:28,900
And I have made this hermitage..

1721
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:30,700
..with my brains an efforts.

1722
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:32,620
And you... You thief!

1723
01:42:32,700 --> 01:42:34,966
Mind your own business, dumb man.

1724
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:36,940
This is Damroo.

1725
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:41,204
When it is time I will
tell you what is it. Hang up.

1726
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:43,380
He has hung up on me.

1727
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:44,380
Everyone thinks I am nothing.

1728
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:47,780
Damroo Baba. Global...
- Get lost!

1729
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:54,980
"The Baba is a pervert."

1730
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:59,420
"The Baba is a pervert."

1731
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:03,780
"The Baba is a pervert."

1732
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:09,340
"The Baba is a pervert."

1733
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:11,020
Hail Global Baba.

1734
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:50,340
Yes. She is going.

1735
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:58,460
Go back.

1736
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:39,860
Boss, Jacob is here.
Just give me order.

1737
01:44:42,180 --> 01:44:43,420
Press the button.

1738
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:03,700
Start the car.

1739
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:11,420
There is a breaking news.

1740
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:15,420
The blast in Kabirganj
has killed 9 and 70 were injured.

1741
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:18,860
It has been shamed
and called cowardly.

1742
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:21,580
Global Baba's TV
journalist Bhavna Sharma..

1743
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:23,340
..has died in this blast.

1744
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:25,860
Bhavna Sharma's death has
been confirmed by the government.

1745
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:27,660
The government said
that the injured are being..

1746
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:29,260
..treated at the
district hospitals.

1747
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:32,100
Sir, I have done an independent..

1748
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:34,820
..inquiry for this accident.
I need your permission.

1749
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:38,500
Sir, the media is
just showing hogwash.

1750
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:40,700
The truth is being concealed.
I mean it, sir.

1751
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:42,980
I can't give you any
permission on this, Jacob.

1752
01:45:43,060 --> 01:45:45,180
Anyway the CBI will
deal with it now.

1753
01:45:45,392 --> 01:45:47,205
You are getting your
transfer orders today.

1754
01:45:47,285 --> 01:45:50,820
You can't do this to me, sir. You...
- Sorry Jacob.

1755
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:53,780
Sorry. And I can't help you.
- Sir, listen to me...

1756
01:45:55,340 --> 01:45:57,500
Don't disturb, Devansh.
- Hi papa.

1757
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:02,260
Wow papa.
- What is that?

1758
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:04,500
What happened, papa? Are you sick?
- Devansh...

1759
01:46:04,580 --> 01:46:06,540
Papa is ill. Go.
- I am ill.

1760
01:46:06,820 --> 01:46:08,740
You go!
- Shut up.

1761
01:46:09,018 --> 01:46:10,020
Shut up.

1762
01:46:10,708 --> 01:46:13,220
I escaped the bomb and
now you will shout and kill me.

1763
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:18,540
Take him away.
- Uncle, phone. It's Baba. - Baba?

1764
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:24,180
Greetings, Baba.

1765
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:27,900
Dallu Yadav. How are you?

1766
01:46:28,057 --> 01:46:30,760
Baba, I escaped because
of your kindness.

1767
01:46:31,950 --> 01:46:35,420
Baba, please forgive my mistakes.

1768
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:39,511
I am withdrawing my
name from the election.

1769
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:44,260
I am giving up politics.
Now I will only serve you, Baba.

1770
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:46,420
Please take me in.

1771
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,140
Hello. We will start
the news today..

1772
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:50,140
..with the bomb blast in Kabirganj.

1773
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:52,980
The home minister of
the state Dallu Yadav..

1774
01:46:53,060 --> 01:46:55,420
..has said that foreign powers
are responsible for it.

1775
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:56,860
In the beginning
it was said that the..

1776
01:46:56,940 --> 01:46:58,420
..Global Ashram was
responsible for this blast.

1777
01:46:58,620 --> 01:47:00,980
Actually this idea
was raised since this..

1778
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:04,100
..bomb blast happened
in Dallu Yadav's expose rally.

1779
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:05,540
That the Global Ashram might..

1780
01:47:05,620 --> 01:47:06,820
..be responsible for this blast.

1781
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:09,460
But Dallu Yadav has clarified that...

1782
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:11,580
It is being said that
the blast in Kabirganj..

1783
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:14,140
..was ordered by foreign powers.

1784
01:47:15,460 --> 01:47:16,620
Mister.

1785
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:20,260
You?

1786
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:26,220
I have come to give you something.
Keep this.

1787
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:28,540
What is this?

1788
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:31,820
This is the stuff which
can defeat the greatest warriors.

1789
01:47:32,180 --> 01:47:33,460
What do you mean?

1790
01:47:33,540 --> 01:47:38,420
I mean it contains all
the antics of Global Baba.

1791
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:41,060
Here you are, sir.

1792
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:42,500
Why are you giving it to me?

1793
01:47:42,700 --> 01:47:44,700
Because people trusts him.

1794
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:48,060
And I am someone who
can turn dust into gold..

1795
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:50,420
..and then turn gold into dust.

1796
01:47:53,060 --> 01:47:54,260
Tell me one thing...

1797
01:47:56,135 --> 01:47:58,020
I won't speak now.

1798
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:12,460
"The era of the Baba is even
greater than the era of royalty."

1799
01:48:12,902 --> 01:48:15,980
"The era of the Baba is even
greater than the era of royalty."

1800
01:48:16,580 --> 01:48:19,700

greater than the era of royalty."

1801
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:23,420
"The era of the Baba is even
greater than the era of royalty."

1802
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:26,675
"We appreciate Global Baba.
Check this out."

1803
01:48:27,620 --> 01:48:31,140
"You remember the Baba
when you are in trouble."

1804
01:48:31,220 --> 01:48:34,740
"Baba is your ambrosia."

1805
01:48:35,020 --> 01:48:38,420
"Baba is the tonic
to get rid of problems."

1806
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:42,180
"Baba can get rid
of eras of problems."

1807
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:46,020
"The one who touches
his feet becomes lucky."

1808
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:49,740
"The era of the Baba is even
greater than the era of royalty."

1809
01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:53,060
"The era of the Baba is even
greater than the era of royalty."

1810
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:56,850
"The era of the Baba is even
greater than the era of royalty."

1811
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:11,900
"Hail. Hail. Hail Baba."

1812
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:13,660
"Everything is done above."

1813
01:49:13,740 --> 01:49:15,460
"So why does he chants mantras."

1814
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:19,260
"Once the devil is
out then Lucifer follows."

1815
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:22,420
"DM, CM, everyone holds his feet."

1816
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:26,140
"They wait until
they get to meet him."

1817
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:28,220
"Everyone bows down to him..

1818
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:29,820
..no matter how great they are."

1819
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:33,820
"Money is showered
on him in great amounts."

1820
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:37,620
"Lot of people come
to pay homage to the Baba."

1821
01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:40,740
"The era of the Baba is even

1824
01:50:03,540 --> 01:50:07,140
"If anyone tries to attack Baba."

1825
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:10,780
"Even the government is shaken."

1826
01:50:10,860 --> 01:50:14,460
"The one who messes with
religion is gone forever."

1827
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:18,140
"Everything is finished
at just one call."

1828
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:21,740
"The saffron robes weigh
heavy on the khaki uniform."

"Though dirty it is a business."

1833
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:54,900
"The problem is nobody
challenges religion."

1834
01:50:55,180 --> 01:50:58,220
"One might get dishonored,
but who cares?"

1835
01:50:58,763 --> 01:51:02,340
"Everyone is blind in
spite of seeing everything."

1836
01:51:02,514 --> 01:51:04,300
"In one place they are
worshipping and singing hymns."

1837
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:06,340
"And in the other they
are having intercourse."
