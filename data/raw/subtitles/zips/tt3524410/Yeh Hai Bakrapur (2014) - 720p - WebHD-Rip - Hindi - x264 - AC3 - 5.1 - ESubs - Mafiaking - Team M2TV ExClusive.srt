1
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,390
"The monkey looks for taste
of ginger in the democracy."

2
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:03,100
"They say and we hear
that nobody killed Jessica."

3
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,780
"The monkey looks for taste
of ginger in the democracy."

4
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,740
"They say and we hear
that nobody killed Jessica."

5
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,580
"The buffalo says that play
the organ and I shall dance."

6
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,410
"I sell off for votes
but I still curse my fate."

7
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:29,710
"Look how the fox has
ventured into the city."

8
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:39,270
"The ominous one
looks out for a curse.."

9
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,650
"The ominous one
looks out for a curse.."

10
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,830
They say there's a reason

11
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,000
behind everything
in this world.

12
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,250
But, can you think of a reason

13
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,670
behind what's going on here?

14
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,680
This place is beyond reason.

15
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,850
This is Bakrapur.

16
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,740
O' Lord!

17
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,910
May the Lord bless you
with his grace.

18
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,460
How are you?

19
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,250
May the Lord bless you
with his grace.

20
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,270
May the Lord bless you
with his grace.

21
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,600
How is business?
- Good.

22
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,900
My Lord!

23
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,570
May the Lord bless you
with his grace.

24
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,070
O' Lord!

25
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,830
Don't hoard.
Share what you have.

26
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,330
You can't take it to your grave.

27
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,750
You brought nothing.
You'll take back nothing.

28
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,880
Right?
Let's drink to it.

29
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,720
May the Lord bless you!

30
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,720
Not a penny more.

31
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,980
But the deal was for 3000!

32
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,060
3000 bucks for incense?

33
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,070
No. I was talking
about Shahrukh.

34
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,320
Suraiyya finalized
everything with Mr. Usman.

35
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,650
Fine, take a seat.

36
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,200
Come on, boy.

37
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,770
Zulfi, are you dreaming again?

38
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,940
Memorize the entire
lesson by tomorrow.

39
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,520
Yes, teacher.

40
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,940
Concentrate.

41
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,700
No more mischief!
Keep studying..

42
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,010
Suraiyya!

43
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,760
Suraiyya!

44
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,260
Greetings, Ms. Nooran.
- Greetings.

45
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,770
I was on my way to the city.

46
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,850
Did you arrange for the money?

47
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,440
He left for the city just this
morning, along with his uncle.

48
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,400
I will somehow get the
money to you by evening.

49
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,400
I guess you aren't
tired of making excuses.

50
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,690
But I am tired of
listening to them.

51
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,620
I bought imported
shoes for myself.

52
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,500
I'll elope with you in a trice.

53
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,290
I see.
- What?

54
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,340
I've things to do here.

55
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,130
That's why I say

56
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,130
talk to your father.

57
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,510
I'll treat you
like a movie star.

58
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,430
Star!

59
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,470
This cheap mobile
that you bought me

60
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,430
can't even take
decent pictures.

61
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,690
Forget the mobile.

62
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,100
I'll bring you a
laptop this time.

63
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,810
The big one.
One with a camera.

64
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,610
Listen.
- What?

65
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,900
Naaz.

66
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,650
How about a kiss?

67
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,360
Don't laugh.

68
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,820
Have you seen yourself
in the mirror?

69
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,910
Asking for a kiss!
- I have. I look nice.

70
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,870
Naaz. What are you doing?
- Who was that?

71
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,080
Listen, I need to get going.

72
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,460
I am not done yet.

73
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,750
Are you still there?
- Coming, mother.

74
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,380
Cut your crap, I have to go.

75
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,340
Mother's here. Goodbye.
- Naaz..

76
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,090
Why don't you all just kill me?

77
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,680
I was working, mother.

78
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,970
I hope you didn't get blisters.

79
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,600
An incompetent husband

80
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,690
and two good-for-nothing
children.

81
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,560
There's just no end
to my problems.

82
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,230
What the heck is that?
- Mother, must be a bee..

83
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,400
Please go inside,
I'll be with you.

84
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,030
Come soon.
- Yes, mother.

85
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,820
Naaz!

86
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,790
Zulfi!

87
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,710
Zulfi!

88
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,050
Hey, hot shot!

89
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,770
What's wrong with you?

90
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,270
Zulfi!

91
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,940
Why so sad?

92
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,190
Say something.
- It's nothing, Mr. Jaffer.

93
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,450
Nothing?

94
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,740
Then why do you look
like a sacrificial lamb?

95
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,040
Zulfi!

96
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,380
I was looking for you.

97
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,300
Wait.

98
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,390
Get on my bike.

99
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,810
How can a man be so stupid?

100
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,690
Suraiyya. Is it my fault

101
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,270
that Usman's mother-in-law
broke her back?

102
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,650
No, it's entirely my fault!

103
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,440
It's my father's fault!

104
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,030
For getting me married
to a penniless man.

105
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,660
And what was the point
of you going along?

106
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,580
You two are just useless.

107
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,960
Teach her some manners.

108
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,790
If she continues
yelling this way

109
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,250
we'll soon rot in inferno.

110
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,670
Right. Just sit here and rant
about heaven and inferno.

111
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,720
A woman has to do the chores

112
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,880
as well as amass money
by selling eggs and hens.

113
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,760
The men of this family,
lazy to the core!

114
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,640
Arrange for the money somehow.

115
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,930
Otherwise, I'm going
back to my mother's.

116
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,060
I won't stay here
a minute longer.

117
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,660
Come in, Mr. Munna.

118
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,910
I am free.
Come in.

119
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,370
I want to style my hair.
Is Mr. Jaffer in?

120
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,080
Greetings.
- See you later.

121
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,960
Go on in.
- Take a seat.

122
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,840
Ever since you returned from the
city, business has been slow.

123
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,550
Everyone asks for Jaffer.

124
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,720
And for free.

125
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,760
Father, why be sad?

126
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,140
They come here
because they've faith in me

127
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,560
as I've learnt
new techniques.

128
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,350
How can I charge them money?

129
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,100
In fact,
I should be paying them.

130
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,060
I'm getting a chance to practice.
Look at this new style.

131
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,440
Shall I teach you?
- Shut up! What faith?

132
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:29,110
A beggar asking for alms
is happy with what he gets.

133
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,200
They are here for freebies.
- Father.

134
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,530
Yes.
- Chill, dude.

135
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,580
How about I thrash you..
- No, no, remain seated.

136
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,590
Haven't you finished yet?

137
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,470
Just a little longer.

138
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,640
I see.
- Yes.

139
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,850
What are you doing here?

140
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,220
I was running an errand
for my mother.

141
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,100
You know,
I soaked henna yesterday.

142
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,560
Come tomorrow,
and we'll apply it together.

143
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,280
And, is everything okay?

144
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,700
Naaz.

145
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,540
What are you doing here?

146
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,540
Come on, go home.
Your mother's looking for you.

147
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,130
Didn't you hear it?

148
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,500
Go home.

149
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,010
I am going, there's no need to yell.

150
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,050
Go on. Go home.

151
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,590
Did he have to drop in now?

152
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,470
Greetings.
- Greetings.

153
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,680
No, no.. Leave.

154
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,730
Majid,
you were really brave today.

155
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,850
Give me a smoke.

156
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,860
Zulfi. What do we do
with your hair today?

157
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,780
What style would you like?

158
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,740
Aamir? Salman?

159
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,740
Or Shahrukh.
- The children these days..

160
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,710
What can a poor mother
do all alone?

161
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,750
Majid wants to get romantic.

162
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,840
But his wife's just
not playing along.

163
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,630
Go ahead, make fun of me.

164
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,880
Can't help it when
I'm ill-fated.

165
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,430
Are you Majid?

166
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,850
Yes. Is something wrong?

167
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,640
Is Suraiyya home?

168
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,430
Suraiyya..
She is.

169
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,140
Let's go.

170
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,070
Mother.
- Yes.

171
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,490
Mother. They are here!
- Who?

172
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,120
Them! - Them?
- Yes.

173
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,910
Your father didn't exactly
leave behind a fortune!

174
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,830
Tell them I'm not at home.
Go on.

175
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,540
But, mother.
They met father on the way.

176
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,840
Oh God! I'm tired of this man!

177
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,130
Go on, I'm coming.

178
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,930
Yes.

179
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,430
Is everyone here?

180
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,600
Start collecting.
Shakuntala!

181
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,520
Vidyavati.

182
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,900
Saraswati.

183
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,150
I hope you're making
sure their payment's right.

184
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,530
Mallika.

185
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,650
Yes.
- Is it all there?

186
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,120
Greetings, ma'am.
- I see.

187
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,790
So, you're finally here.

188
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,120
That's not it, ma'am.

189
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,460
Why wouldn't I come to meet you?

190
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,460
I won't be fooled
by you anymore.

191
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,670
And your leader, Nooran..

192
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,550
She's been taking your side.
- No, ma'am.

193
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,260
I visit her on your behalf.

194
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,680
Ma'am, my circumstances
are such that..

195
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,020
It's no secret, everyone
knows about my situation.

196
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,310
Zulfi's father's aunt, who
lives in Sultanpur, fell ill.

197
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,650
I wonder what sort of
an outbreak it was

198
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,440
and half my poultry
succumbed to it.

199
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,240
And then..
- Stop.

200
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,610
In the last three months

201
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,530
you haven't paid the
loan or the interest.

202
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,830
Ma'am, try to understand.
I swear on my child.

203
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,580
I'm not lying.

204
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,580
The circumstances..
Just give me a little more time!

205
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:15,210
Look, Suraiyya. All these
women have repaid their loan.

206
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,970
If you don't repay
the money in a week

207
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,800
I will stop everyone's
loan in this group.

208
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,140
No one will get anything.

209
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,600
See that. Helping you has
landed all of us in trouble.

210
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,350
What do I say?

211
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,440
I was honestly coming
to the office to pay you.

212
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,610
But just then, Mr. Usman's

213
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,110
mother-in-law broke her back.

214
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,740
We're in a lot of trouble..

215
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,110
You should've thought
about it before.

216
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,740
I explained the rules
in the beginning.

217
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,120
Didn't I?
- Yes.

218
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:50,040
Look, Suraiyya.
If you don't return the money

219
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,420
in a week, then be ready
to face legal procedures.

220
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,000
Everyone!

221
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,710
Let's go!

222
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:12,850
Hocus-Pocus!
Abracadabra!

223
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,730
Run away!

224
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,560
Leave this kid alone!

225
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,360
Go!

226
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,860
Go away!

227
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,530
Ma'am, the kid's being
haunted by a spirit.

228
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,660
But don't you worry.

229
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,580
I've chanted a strong mantra

230
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,750
and got rid of it.

231
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,420
Here.

232
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,460
Make him wear this
in the morning, after bath.

233
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,090
Everything will be okay.
May the Lord bless you!

234
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,050
What's wrong?

235
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,760
Why are you upset?

236
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,850
Have you eaten
or are you fasting?

237
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,180
No..
Why would he fast?

238
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,230
All the villagers
are humiliating me.

239
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,520
And all you two care
about is stuffing your mouths.

240
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,940
I want the money
before Thursday..

241
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,440
Otherwise, I won't
stay here a moment.

242
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,650
Spare me!

243
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,780
How can we get
the money so soon?

244
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,700
Who will lend us the money,
uncle?

245
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,830
Of course.
Who will lend you the money?

246
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,410
The only one who could,
gave you his daughter instead.

247
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,460
Mother, I am hungry.
- Why did you bring him inside?

248
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,670
Naaz, take him outside.
- Come in.

249
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,050
Don't worry, I know a way.

250
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,640
What is it, uncle?
Tell me.

251
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,600
Don't worry,
we'll get the money.

252
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,470
Where will we get it from?

253
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,480
Is there a lottery running
for mendicants now?

254
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,480
Stop taunting me.

255
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,360
I was talking about Shahrukh.
- Shahrukh?

256
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,520
I can never make
sense of what you say.

257
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,280
The animal fair of Malshapur
is quite popular.

258
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,950
We'll take Shahrukh there.

259
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,820
Many buyers come there.

260
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,370
We'll get a good price.

261
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,160
Usman offered better
than that, for sure.

262
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,410
You're right, uncle.

263
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,120
Zulfi, catch the ball.

264
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,870
Zulfi. Could you not have
caught the ball?

265
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,030
Oh God!

266
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,080
The Lord had
answered my prayers

267
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,790
and blessed me with a son.

268
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
And now, he's gone as well.

269
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,960
Uncle. I looked everywhere,
but Zulfi's nowhere.

270
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,720
Oh God! My son.

271
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,890
He's just a child.
Where can he possibly go?

272
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,310
He didn't go alone,
he took Shahrukh along.

273
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,770
What were you doing?

274
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,600
Uncle, they left quietly.

275
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,400
Even that animal
didn't make a sound.

276
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,860
Stop crying like a girl!

277
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,070
My son!

278
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,700
I told you not to call.

279
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,950
Everyone's so worried.

280
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,700
Sweetheart, I'm worried too.
In your love.

281
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,500
Listen. I had a wonderful
dream this morning.

282
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,630
You and me, by the seaside.

283
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,840
It was beautiful.

284
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,260
Naaz..
Naaz. Why are you crying?

285
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,680
What's the matter. - Zulfi ran away
from home.. - What?

286
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,220
What are you saying?
When did this happen?

287
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,100
And, with Shahrukh.

288
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,960
Hey!

289
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,260
Wonderful.

290
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,300
Everyone's worried back home

291
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,890
while you two
are having a ball.

292
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,220
And, with biscuits.

293
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,470
I knew this is where
I would find you.

294
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,100
You know,
when father would beat me

295
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,230
I too would hide here.

296
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
It's a nice place, right?

297
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,190
Listen, let's go home.

298
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,900
No, I don't want to go home.

299
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,320
Where else do you want to go?
- Take us to the city.

300
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,830
We will work with you too.

301
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,290
Come along,
and bring Shahrukh too.

302
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,250
He will make for a great barber.

303
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,580
Shahrukh that is..
Let's go.

304
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,130
We'll go to the city later,
let's now go home.

305
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,340
Can't we stay here until Sunday?

306
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,010
What's on Sunday?

307
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:37,300
They're taking Shahrukh
to the Malshapur fair that day.

308
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,310
So, you want to hide
here till Sunday? - Yes.

309
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,060
Great.

310
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,600
What will you do next Sunday?

311
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,440
The fair's just once a month.
- You're smart.

312
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,110
What will you do next month?

313
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,650
I don't know, Mr. Jaffer!

314
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,660
Just take us along.

315
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,660
I don't know, Mr. Jaffer.

316
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,120
Come along with me.

317
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,080
You've my word
that nothing will go wrong.

318
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,790
We'll go to the city too
tagging Shahrukh and you along.

319
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,630
Let's go home now.
- Why did you run away?

320
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,710
Do you know how worried we were?

321
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,630
If you ever do it again,
I'll break your limbs.

322
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,800
That's great, ma'am.

323
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,140
That's a nice way
to teach him a lesson.

324
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,310
Break his legs.
- I don't like saying it either.

325
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,640
A child never understands
a mother's heart.

326
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,110
May the Lord bless you
with progress in your work.

327
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,440
Work's good, ma'am.

328
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,900
Just bless me so that
I find a nice bride.

329
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,030
That's it.
- Of course.

330
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,040
Any girl would be
fortunate to marry you.

331
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,290
I see.

332
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,160
So, sir..

333
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,580
Are you sure about
the Malshapur fair?

334
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,670
Yes, I..
- There's no other choice.

335
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,130
These children have
never had to starve

336
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,470
so, they will never
understand our condition.

337
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,010
They will have to understand,
ma'am.

338
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,190
The food's begging to be eaten.

339
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,490
But, the boy's still stubborn.

340
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,950
Fine. You want to starve,
don't you? Then go ahead.

341
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,880
Zulfi. Don't infuriate me.

342
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,840
Mother. Leave him alone.
I'll console him.

343
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,670
Oh my!

344
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,300
You never cared so much
about your mother before.

345
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,430
Why, mother?

346
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:48,140
Can't I console him?
He's my brother after all.

347
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,810
Yes, he is.

348
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,850
I am the only enemy
in this house.

349
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,110
You two can do anything
you want to. Just spare me.

350
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,780
I don't have the will anymore.

351
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,530
Mother's just impossible!

352
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,490
Zulfi. Get up.

353
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,790
Come with your sister.
- No. I don't want to go.

354
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,160
Hear me out.

355
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,370
Let's go sit outside.
- Leave me alone, sister.

356
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,790
I said, don't be stubborn.

357
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,590
Come along. Come on..

358
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,340
Come on.

359
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,310
Mother's always scolding him.

360
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,470
And he isn't eating either.

361
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,770
Talk to him.

362
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,270
Who is it?
- Here.

363
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,270
Zulfi.
- Mr. Jaffer!

364
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,190
So, why aren't you eating?

365
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,650
No, I don't want to eat?

366
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,820
Why?

367
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,490
They are taking Shahrukh away.

368
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,370
Don't you want to save him?

369
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,740
Yes.

370
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,330
Then do as I say.

371
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,910
Go inside and finish your meal.

372
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,000
And come, meet me an hour later..

373
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,550
At the old fort,
along with Shahrukh.

374
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,090
And, don't tell anyone about it.
Understood?

375
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,390
Do you attend school?

376
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,100
Yes.

377
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,640
Why?

378
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,730
Read this aloud.

379
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,780
What's written..

380
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,030
Alif..

381
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,160
Laam..

382
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,950
Zulfi!

383
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,500
Are you going to take
that long to read it?

384
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,210
Tell me now.
What's written in it?

385
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,880
Lord!

386
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,000
It says Lord.

387
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,670
That's it.

388
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,590
Now,
only Lord can save Shahrukh.

389
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,100
How?

390
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,520
Like this.

391
00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:00,000
"A mighty goat escorted
by two courtiers."

392
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,340
"A mighty goat escorted
by two courtiers."

393
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:13,560
"Appreciate the irony.
Indulge in the ruckus.."

394
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,940
"Be it the household merchandise,
the prices have gone sky high."

395
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,570
He won't even give 10 kilos of meat.
What are you saying?

396
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,620
Nothing less than 4500..
- That's too much.

397
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,740
2500 is all we can give.
2500 is too less.

398
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,500
Go find someone else.

399
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,760
11,000!
- 11,000!

400
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,100
How about 3000?
4000 is too much!

401
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,810
That's not possible.

402
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,690
It's a fine goat.
Take a look.

403
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,320
How much?

404
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,900
How much?
- 5000!

405
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,820
Quote reasonably!

406
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,150
He's stuck at 5000!

407
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,570
How much did you offer?
- Leave him.

408
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,700
How much did you offer?
- 2500.

409
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,580
Let's settle for 3500.
That's it.

410
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,950
Give me at least 4000.
- No, 4000 is too much.

411
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,460
Hear me out!

412
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,670
Just 500 more.
We've brought him from far.

413
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,500
Even I have to go a long way.

414
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,960
Let's settle for 3500.
That's it.

415
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,220
Fine. How much are
you willing to offer?

416
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,220
3500, that's it. Nothing more.

417
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,470
Greetings, sir.

418
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,930
Greetings, lad.
What brings you here?

419
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,100
Nothing, sir.

420
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,640
A friend of mine from the city,
lives here.

421
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:41,850
So I came here with him.

422
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,140
That's good, lad.

423
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:46,110
How are you?
How are you, Shahrukh?

424
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
So, you're leaving us
today, right?

425
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,320
Fine, hand over the rope to me.
I've got to leave.

426
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,110
Just 500 more.

427
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,910
I'm offering you
a reasonable price.

428
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,040
Okay, like you say.

429
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,950
Sir.

430
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,500
How much did you sell him for?

431
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,420
3500. He's sold, at least.

432
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,590
What do you mean?

433
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,670
You sold an animal worth
3 to 4 lakhs for few thousands.

434
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,720
3 lakhs?
- He's a prankster.

435
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,640
Always playing pranks.
- I see.

436
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,100
Don't listen to him.

437
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,100
He's not covered with gold.
- Right.

438
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,020
He's better than that,
sir.

439
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,940
He's blessed with
the grace of the Lord.

440
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,310
Don't joke about this.

441
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,860
What? What are you saying?

442
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,690
Be clear, what are you saying?

443
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,280
You're a mendicant.

444
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,950
How could you miss this?
- What?

445
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,330
Look here. Carefully.
Here.

446
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,330
This. Take a good look.

447
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,870
Look at the crescent shape.

448
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,340
Have you seen the
Mecca-Medina calendar?

449
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,630
You must have.

450
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,300
The crescent shining,
on top of the dome.

451
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,760
It's the same thing.

452
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,430
You're a wise man.

453
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,680
And you didn't see it either.

454
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,020
You didn't go on Haj, but
you've a world of experience.

455
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,560
Don't you?

456
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,940
It's true.
- Yes.

457
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,940
Child, it says Lord.

458
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,110
Hail the Lord!
My service has been accepted.

459
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,330
He's an angel, child.

460
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,450
Don't sell it.
- This is no ordinary goat!

461
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,950
I don't care.

462
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:27,040
Just handover the animal to me.
I'll be on my way.

463
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,380
Don't call him an animal.

464
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,960
He's an angel.
Apologize to him.

465
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,250
We didn't take any
money from you.

466
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,380
So, I am not refusing to pay.
Take it.

467
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,720
Didn't we make a deal?

468
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,050
Look.
My nephew's not so wise.

469
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,390
Look. We don't want to sell it.
Just leave. - Leave..

470
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,100
But, uncle..
- Dear, didn't you see that?

471
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,060
It's Lord written on him.

472
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,190
We cannot sell him.

473
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,900
But, uncle,
what will we tell Suraiyya?

474
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,150
We cannot set foot in
the house without the money.

475
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,610
Henpecked husband!

476
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,570
Don't you understand
what Jaffer's saying?

477
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,700
Lord is written on him.
- Yes.

478
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,490
And, a Sheikh from Saudi

479
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,290
paid 52 lakhs
for a similar goat.

480
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,500
52 lakhs!

481
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,960
52 lakhs.
- 52 lakhs?

482
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,830
He took it home on an airplane.

483
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,960
Airplane?

484
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,380
Of course.

485
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,590
It requires special permission
from the government.

486
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,220
But, how do you know?

487
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,840
I read the newspaper.

488
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,720
And I can show you
the news as well.

489
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,890
Even the kids from
Delhi's Jamma Masjid area

490
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,890
know about it.
Do you want to read it?

491
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,520
Child, even I've heard
the Jamma Masjid story.

492
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,850
Indeed.
- Let's take him back.

493
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,150
He's been blessed
by the Lord!

494
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,780
How could I trust that man?
He's good for nothing.

495
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,530
I wonder how father spent
so many years with you.

496
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,700
Yes. We'll see.

497
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,330
How your husband tolerates you!

498
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:53,380
Mother. Father's back.

499
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,550
Didn't I tell you?

500
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,880
This man isn't
capable of anything.

501
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,390
Stop.
Stop right there.

502
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,930
Listen. Listen to me..

503
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,510
Why don't you try
telling our creditors?

504
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,770
Maybe, they will listen to you.

505
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,480
I'm trying to speak.
Let me speak!

506
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,940
Look, dear.
Shahrukh' s no ordinary goat.

507
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,190
He's blessed by the Lord!
He's special.

508
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,400
He's our golden goose.

509
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:20,530
Are you two drunk?

510
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,530
You could've brought
me some poison.

511
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,450
God forbid.
Explain it to her.

512
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,040
Suraiyya.. You tell her.

513
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,870
He's right, ma'am.

514
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,500
Jaffer says Shahrukh' s
not worth a few thousands

515
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,420
but he's worth millions.

516
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,880
And,
if we can find an Arab merchant

517
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,840
he will definitely
pay millions for him.

518
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,390
And, the story about 52 lakhs is
famous in Jamma Masjid. - Right.

519
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,890
Even the kids know about it.
Right?

520
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,060
I see.

521
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,260
Tell her.
- Yes, tell her.

522
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:52,890
He's right.
- But, what is he saying?

523
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,810
Child, you're the educated one.

524
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,770
Why don't you explain it
to me?

525
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,400
Ma'am, an angel
has descended in your home.

526
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,450
Take a look.

527
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,570
Look at the crescent formation.

528
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,790
Have you seen the
Mecca-Medina calendar?

529
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,540
You must have. The crescent
moon, shines atop the dome.

530
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,710
It's the same thing.

531
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,040
Right?
- Yes.

532
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,500
Yes.. It's something.

533
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,510
What do you mean by something,
ma'am?

534
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,380
It's time to celebrate.

535
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:27,930
That's alright, child.
But, what about the creditors?

536
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,020
Loan!
Stop worrying about them, ma'am.

537
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,520
What's the amount?
- 3000!

538
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,810
3000! Come on now, ma'am.
Here you go.

539
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,440
What's he doing?
How can I borrow from him?

540
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,610
Take it. But..
- I.. I'm family too.

541
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:46,240
I mean.. I am not an outsider.

542
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,280
Just take it..
- What!

543
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,790
Ma'am. You can return it once
you find an Arab buyer.

544
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,080
With interest.
- Yes..

545
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,330
Let's get him some water.
- Let's get him some water.

546
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,290
Ma'am, a golden goose.

547
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,500
Come.

548
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,090
Brother,
you'll get a chance too.

549
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,760
Don't worry.
Everyone will get a chance.

550
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,020
God's watching over everyone.
Everyone will get a chance.

551
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,310
What's going on here?

552
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:17,850
Yes, come forward.
Get the blessings.

553
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,440
Keep the money.
Yes.

554
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,280
O' Lord!

555
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,200
Wear this talisman, in the
morning after your bath. Okay.

556
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,950
Goodbye.
Keep moving.

557
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:31,200
All in line.
- What's going on?

558
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,490
Don't interfere.

559
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,080
Come on. Keep moving.
Put your money in this.

560
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,460
Take the blessings..
- What's this?

561
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,300
It's the grace of God.
Let us work, leave.

562
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,260
The Lord will bless you!

563
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,430
O' Lord!

564
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,890
Keep coming.
This way.

565
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:55,890
Come on.

566
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,100
Slowly.

567
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,650
Put the money in here.

568
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,130
My beautiful, gorgeous Suraiyya.

569
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,930
Each time she decks up,
my heart skips a beat.

570
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,320
I'm totally fed up!
I should..

571
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,730
Listen to me. I'll just
wait for five more minutes.

572
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,280
I see.
Five for you and five for me.

573
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,610
How about me coming
in 10 minutes?

574
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,740
10 minutes?
I'll grow old in 10 minutes.

575
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,280
Would you still love me
if I get grey hair?

576
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,120
I will still love you.

577
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,870
And, if your hair turns grey,
I'll paint it black.

578
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,380
I'm an expert at it.

579
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,590
Right, painter.

580
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:51,380
By the way, painters command
more respect than barbers.

581
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,800
I see.
- Of course.

582
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:55,050
Just imagine,
Jaffer Super Barber.

583
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,560
Hair-cutting, massage,
and all that.. All free.

584
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,390
I see. You've been getting
too bold these days.

585
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,770
Aren't you scared of
your mother any longer

586
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,940
that you're being so audacious?

587
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,570
Wait, I'll come right now
and teach you a lesson.

588
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,940
I..

589
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,740
I..
- Okay.

590
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,700
Who do you think you are?
- Sorry.

591
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:16,910
By the way,
where's your mother?

592
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,290
Doesn't she ask you..
Naaz, where are you?

593
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,410
Naaz, where were you?

594
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,380
Only if she gets some
time off from Shahrukh.

595
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,210
By the way, Shahrukh' s a little angel.
- I see.

596
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:32,800
Tell me something.
Don't you think

597
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,850
we should get blessed by
Shahrukh' s grace as well?

598
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,470
Why?

599
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,980
Don't you think,
the mark on Shahrukh

600
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,520
is a stamp of Lord's
approval for our love.

601
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:47,810
Right?

602
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,360
Isn't it?

603
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,400
You see..
We meet so freely these days.

604
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:01,160
What are you thinking about?
- No. Nothing.

605
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:06,330
Right?
- Yes. You're right.

606
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,250
There's a dialogue from actor
Shahrukh' s movie..

607
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:12,630
If you want something
from your heart..

608
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,430
The entire universe conspires
to unite you with it.

609
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,590
Or something like that.

610
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,100
Shahrukh' s a part
of our world too.

611
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,770
So what if he's a goat.

612
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,100
Right?

613
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,270
Universe.

614
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,690
You're talking about the universe!
- You touch me a lot these days.

615
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,480
You're getting audacious.

616
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:37,610
"Meeting secretly."

617
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,660
"And hiding again."

618
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:45,830
"The heart's missing a beat.."

619
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,790
"In love.."

620
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:56,420
"The heart risks everything."

621
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:03,470
"The heart risks everything."

622
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,350
"Since my heart.."

623
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,400
"Since my heart.."

624
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,320
"Since my heart fell"

625
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,820
"prey to your love."

626
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:25,700
"Meeting secretly."

627
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,380
"And hiding again."

628
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,560
"We can convey everything"

629
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,020
"with our eyes."

630
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,650
"The heart can communicate"

631
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,910
"without any means."

632
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:05,740
"We can convey everything"

633
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,080
"with our eyes."

634
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:13,710
"The heart can communicate"

635
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,920
"without any means."

636
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:20,090
"The call of love"

637
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:24,600
"is no longer on hold."

638
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:28,140
"Nor is"

639
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,690
"there a single day without you."

640
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,480
"Since my heart.."

641
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,740
"Since my heart.."

642
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:44,450
"Since my heart fell"

643
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,080
"prey to your love."

644
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,460
Greetings, Majid.

645
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,800
Greetings.

646
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,010
You look really nice.

647
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,760
I guess sister Suraiyya's really
pleased with you these days.

648
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,560
It's the grace of God
that he sent Shahrukh to us.

649
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,940
With a little contribution
from Suraiyya as well.

650
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:18,860
Mr. Jamal, you should get a share too.
- How?

651
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:22,360
Because your son
spotted the goat first.

652
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,700
Mr. Sohail

653
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:27,870
my son can spot
all the problems in the world.

654
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,580
Except those of his father.

655
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:32,370
Don't say that, Mr. Jamal.
- It's true, Majid.

656
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,670
Not at all.

657
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,880
Mr. Majid,
the police is at your home.

658
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,130
Police?
- Yes.

659
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,800
Go on.
- Let's go, child.

660
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,110
Suraiyya. Are they here
to take Shahrukh away?

661
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,160
Can't you ever think positively?

662
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:13,040
Better be ready for
what's going to follow.

663
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,960
Whose goat is it?
- Who made the money?

664
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,960
Whose goat is it?

665
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,760
Tell him.

666
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,970
Whose goat is it?

667
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,340
We never cheated anyone.

668
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,140
Please don't arrest us.
- Yes.

669
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,970
I never said
that I'm arresting you.

670
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,640
We thought so,
looking at your uniform.

671
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,940
He is Legislator
Syed Suleiman's brother-in-law.

672
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,320
He's opening a new showroom
in the city.

673
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,360
He was really impressed
by your goat.

674
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,860
Send him over on the
day of the inauguration.

675
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,450
Lotan.
- Yes.

676
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,280
Send the jeep in the morning.
- Yes, sir.

677
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,680
Greetings, sir.

678
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,680
Are you on your way?

679
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,890
Of course, we've made
all the arrangements.

680
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,600
Okay.

681
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,190
I think the minister's tied up
with something important.

682
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,230
No, that's not it.
He's on his way.

683
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:26,610
And,
I don't see your brother-in-law.

684
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,370
He's with the minister as well.
They will be here.

685
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:34,370
I see, so Mr. Suleiman's
with the minister? - Yes.

686
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,500
That's good.

687
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,040
This is the right opportunity to show
brotherly love. - Are they here?

688
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,830
They were held up
by a punctured tire.

689
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,460
I don't want to hear anything.

690
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,550
Arrange for another car.

691
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,970
He should be here before
the minister arrives.

692
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,630
Yes. Yes, sir.

693
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:53,350
Is there another guest of honor
other than the minister?

694
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,270
No, that's it.

695
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,690
Long live..
- Minister.

696
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,650
Long live..
- Minister.

697
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:01,810
Long live..
- Minister.

698
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,360
Congratulations, Mr. Rizwan.

699
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,950
How are you? - It's all
your grace, Minister.

700
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,280
Hello, Minister.

701
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:15,290
You too, Singhania.

702
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,460
You never like this ambience.

703
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,830
Things change with time, sir.

704
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:25,090
And, when you're personally
visiting my area

705
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,460
then, it's my duty to attend.

706
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,140
Rizwan, hurry up. The minister's
got other engagements. - Yes.

707
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,890
I was supposed to attend
a cabinet meeting.

708
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,430
But I made it clear.

709
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,560
I am committed to Mr. Suleiman.
I can't attend the meeting.

710
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,730
Of course, you've to please
the alliance partners.

711
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,020
It's the law of
coalition politics.

712
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,940
Pass me the scissors.

713
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,780
Let's not delay this
auspicious event.

714
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,240
Just a few more minutes.

715
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,410
Is it the auspicious hour?
- No, no, just..

716
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,410
Here they are.
- Them?

717
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,910
Come..

718
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,460
You've planned a sacrifice.

719
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:02,080
Honestly, Mr. Suleiman

720
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,750
I don't get the
time anymore

721
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,250
but I really miss your
homemade kebabs.

722
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,840
No.. That isn't the case.

723
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,550
It's for warding off the evil eye.
- I see.

724
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,220
Come.
Please..

725
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:12,690
Look.

726
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:19,780
You're taking the Lord's
angel out for a stroll.

727
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:26,120
You sneaked him out, didn't you?

728
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:30,000
People keep coming to see him.
No one lets me play with him.

729
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,920
That's a problem.

730
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,840
You should be thankful
that he's still alive.

731
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:40,970
We haven't yet been exposed.

732
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:08,120
Can you believe it?

733
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,040
I am waiting in a shady village.
For a bloody goat!

734
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,670
I swear.
I'm going to blow a fuse.

735
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:17,590
But you can't argue
with your boss, right?

736
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,800
Can you?

737
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,600
Hello! Hello?

738
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:22,890
Are you there?

739
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,520
Darn! Network!

740
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:27,390
Icing on the cake.

741
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:30,940
Ma'am, please sit down.
Be patient, he'll be here soon.

742
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:32,480
Get some cold sherbet for ma'am.

743
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,320
Yes.
- No, it's okay. Thanks.

744
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,450
Can I tell you something?
It's about Shahrukh.

745
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:42,700
You know, he was born
right before our eyes.

746
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,410
It was a peculiar night.

747
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:48,500
Strong winds blowing..
Storm..

748
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:49,830
Heavy rains..

749
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:53,210
Lightning struck
in our courtyard.

750
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,630
And right then,
Shahrukh was born.

751
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:59,260
He's the angel of God.
A miracle of nature.

752
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:03,390
Wow! Sounds straight as
if from the twilight zone.

753
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,180
See, he..

754
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:08,810
They are here.
They are here.

755
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:11,440
Ma'am. They are here.
- Come quickly.

756
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:12,940
Come on.
Come, Zulfi.

757
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:14,230
Bring Shahrukh.

758
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,240
Come on, son.

759
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,820
You've been playing in the mud.

760
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,160
Madam. This is Shahrukh.

761
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,830
Look at this.

762
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,550
He is Jaffer. Jaffer.

763
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:45,810
You can tell him too. He lives
in the city, just like you do.

764
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,220
Child, what was that..

765
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,350
That cup..
- World cup.

766
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,850
Yes.
- Cricket World Cup.

767
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:56,270
Cricket.
She's here to pray for them.

768
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,360
Yes, ma'am.
I understood everything.

769
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,110
Myself Jaffer, hair-stylist.

770
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:03,950
In town.

771
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,740
Hi!

772
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,580
The texture of your
hair is really nice.

773
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,630
Thanks.

774
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:19,710
Sachin. I'm a huge fan of him.

775
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,880
Sachin's a client of our agency.
- I see.

776
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,930
In fact, our agency handles
half the Indian team.

777
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,310
What are you saying?

778
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,600
Minister Rawat spoke with
our boss, about Shahrukh.

779
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,600
So, our boss decided that

780
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,730
Shahrukh' s going
to bless all the jerseys

781
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,940
and kits of all the players.

782
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,280
That's great.

783
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,200
He's the lucky charm
of the Indian team.

784
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:43,610
Right. Of course.

785
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,700
By the way,
Shahrukh' s got scope.

786
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:51,250
In fact, he can endorse
local brands. Right?

787
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,830
Money's money after all.

788
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,330
Yes. Money's money after all.

789
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,460
Yes, ma'am.
Money's money after all.

790
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:02,090
"The game begins"

791
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:05,640
"The game begins"

792
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:09,180
"We met a man by
the ghat of Ganges.."

793
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,640
"We met a man by
the ghat of Ganges.."

794
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,020
"Upon inquiring,
it said it's India."

795
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:21,650
"Waiting with patience.."

796
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:30,160
"Waiting for the opportunity.."

797
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:32,120
"Waiting for the opportunity.."

798
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,040
It is not going to
be easy this time.

799
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,000
We need to play the
communal card carefully.

800
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:41,050
They have also chosen
a candidate from our own.

801
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,960
Votes are bound to be split.

802
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,470
So be prepared.

803
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,100
It will be tough. All of you
will have to work hard.

804
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,810
Mujibur Rehman has a good hold
on this area. - Indeed!

805
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:53,480
We will have to do
something to ensure

806
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,480
that our votes
don't go to them.

807
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:59,810
Mr. Suleiman,
do you have any solution?

808
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,400
Yes. I have.

809
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:02,730
Here it is.

810
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,190
Hello.
- Hello.

811
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:05,530
How is your goat?

812
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:15,250
"Waiting for the opportunity.."

813
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:21,290
"The votes are being asked for
in the name of the Lord.."

814
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,670
"The goat shall reign
and that the destiny.."

815
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,840
"It's time for the sacrifice.."

816
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:36,390
"Waiting for the opportunity.."

817
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:42,690
"Be it the sage or the politician..
This is a strange game.."

818
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:45,940
"What sort of amalgamation is this?"

819
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:51,120
"This smells like trouble.."

820
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:54,700
"Waiting for the opportunity.."

821
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,330
You kept insisting on coming.
Jaffer is here.

822
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,290
Jaffer. Jaffer.

823
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,800
Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

824
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,340
Ma'am,
how did you come here today?

825
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:09,550
She wanted to go shopping.

826
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,720
You know I hardly have the time
to spare, from household chores.

827
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:14,680
She kept pushing me.
And now it's raining.

828
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:17,230
It's raining, ma'am.
I'd come for some salon work.

829
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:20,310
It was raining,
so I thought of shopping.

830
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,650
Yes. Why not? It's your
age to enjoy. Let's go.

831
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:27,650
Ma'am, are you hungry?
Let's eat something.

832
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,820
No. No. Do you get any
hygienic stuff in this city?

833
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:32,620
No. No. Let's go.
- No. No, ma'am.

834
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:34,580
What are you saying?
Of course, you get.

835
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:37,120
Tea. Tea is not unhygienic.

836
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,040
We can drink tea.

837
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:40,670
I will take your word for it.

838
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:42,290
Let's drink tea.
Hurry up. Come on.

839
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,880
Ma'am, can I come under the umbrella?
It's raining. - Yes. Come on.

840
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:57,520
"We can communicate
through our eyes."

841
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,190
If not for you

842
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:02,690
we wouldn't be
where we are today.

843
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:06,360
What are you saying, ma'am?
God has done all of this.

844
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,650
I am just a medium.

845
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:12,700
That's true. The tea is still
not here. - Hey! Bring tea!

846
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:15,620
You know what they have come from the village.
They are my close acquaintances.

847
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,790
They have journeyed for 1.5
hours to taste your strong tea.

848
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,210
Isn't it good?

849
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:23,960
God should fulfill
one more wish of mine.

850
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:27,670
I should find a suitable,
employed boy.

851
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,800
He should always
keep my daughter happy.

852
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:34,760
Is that so?
You know what ma'am

853
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,060
my father is also
worried about this.

854
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:40,060
That we should find a girl.

855
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:42,270
You are right.

856
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:47,940
Yes. But he worries
without a reason.

857
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,030
I have told father many times,
ma'am

858
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:53,150
to look in the village.
That there is no shortage of girls.

859
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,280
That we will find someone.

860
00:51:55,870 --> 00:52:00,040
Ma'am, you also look around.
You will find a boy.

861
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,960
Right?
- Yes. We will see.

862
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,510
The party won the elections
because of Shahrukh.

863
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,930
Mother.

864
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:29,940
How do I look, mother?
- Very pretty.

865
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,400
My sweet mother.

866
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,740
Mother, will you buy me

867
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,530
gold bangles on Eid?

868
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,450
I have been telling you
for so long. - Yes. Fine.

869
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:45,960
Save some money for
the motorcycle too.

870
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:47,710
Motorcycle?
- Yes.

871
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:49,790
We have to take
Shahrukh to the city.

872
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,550
A motorcycle would save time.

873
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:53,380
And we will earn more.
Right, Majid?

874
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:54,920
Yes.

875
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:00,140
No. It's not important.

876
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,680
Why?
- Okay. Fine.

877
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:05,560
Don't be so greedy.
Be patient.

878
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:09,940
Let's finalize the soap and
biscuit deals for Shahrukh.

879
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:13,650
Then we will see.
Motorcycles and airplanes.

880
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:15,950
Suraiyya!

881
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,820
Suraiyya!

882
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:29,000
Two-wheeler or three-wheeler?
- What?

883
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:31,090
Let's buy a bicycle.

884
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:35,010
Not in front of the kids.
- Henpecked husband.

885
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,550
Hello.

886
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,180
Everything is fine?
- Hello.

887
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,390
Yes. We are
managing somehow.

888
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,810
My Shabbo is getting
engaged next Friday.

889
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:48,690
I need some money.

890
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:53,820
Ask the lady at the NGO.
Now we don't owe them anything.

891
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,950
Where do I go

892
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,030
when I am in debt?

893
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:04,830
You have never differentiated
between Naaz and Shabbo.

894
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,660
Help us out.

895
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:09,460
That is fine. But you can
see that we barely manage

896
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,500
to make both ends meet.

897
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:13,960
It's difficult to
spare anything.

898
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:29,100
Tea.

899
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,110
Here. A 500 rupee note.

900
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,940
Give me the change early morning.
What is this Rs. 500 for?

901
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:36,690
Should I tear it?

902
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,780
I should have the change to
give you. Right, Jamaal?

903
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:43,280
Go and check.
- Pay me later. It's okay.

904
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:45,290
Why are you inviting
my curse early morning?

905
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:48,290
Have I ever had tea on credit?
- Let it be, priest.

906
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:51,420
He does not know how to speak
to a person of your stature.

907
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,670
Here, take this.
Get going.

908
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,260
God will bless you.

909
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:01,220
What will the Lord bless me with,
priest?

910
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:03,760
Our goats are hardly messiahs.

911
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:08,140
Only fit to be cooked and eaten.
- You always joke.

912
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,270
Whose car is this?

913
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:13,520
Jamaal, seems like a big shot.

914
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:15,650
Is it the real Shahrukh?

915
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,150
Maybe, he wants to get
clicked with our Shahrukh.

916
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,820
It happens before the
release of a new movie.

917
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:22,320
Where does Shahrukh live?
- Yes.

918
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,950
Yes. Come.

919
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:29,200
Who is it?

920
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:30,710
Can someone tell me
where Shahrukh lives?

921
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,670
Shahrukh?
- Who are you?

922
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:38,420
Everyone calls me the priest.
Shahrukh belongs to our family.

923
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:39,880
My name is Rayeez Ahmed.
- Okay.

924
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,390
I am Saudi Sheikh Abdul
Rehman Bakhtiyar's PA.

925
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:46,550
Saudi?
Praise the Lord!

926
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,890
O' Lord, thanks a lot.

927
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:51,770
Come..

928
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,020
Another treasure-trove.
- Come.

929
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:57,940
Have tea.
- No. I don't drink tea.

930
00:55:58,110 --> 00:55:59,360
So shall I get something
cold instead?

931
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,820
Go and get a cold drink. - Yes.
- No. Thank you.

932
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:09,200
Do you know Mr. Pandey?
- Mr. Pandey?

933
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:10,620
Mr. Pandey.

934
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,830
His company PML Consultants

935
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,870
manages your
Indian cricket team.

936
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,710
The lady with the kit.
- Yes.

937
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,670
Yes. We know her very well.

938
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,260
We were discussing our
new company logo with him.

939
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:26,890
What logo?
- Nothing.

940
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,100
Actually, Mr. Pandey advised
Sheikh to use

941
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,270
Shahrukh' s photograph
for the logo.

942
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,810
Yes. - Mr. Sheikh said,
not just the photograph

943
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:40,360
he would buy Shahrukh.
- It's good.

944
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,110
Can I see him?
- Sure. Look. Come. Look.

945
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,660
Zulfi.

946
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,030
Zulfi, move.

947
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,460
Zulfi,
show it to Mr. Sheikh yourself.

948
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,380
Wow! Wonderful.

949
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,800
Good.

950
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,510
Good.

951
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:07,180
He is an angel.
We were facing tough times.

952
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:11,100
But now, we earn no less
than Rs.20,000 a month.

953
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,230
Sheikh is coming
to India in a month or two.

954
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,060
We will finalize everything
when he arrives.

955
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:19,730
A month or two?
- Will it take so long?

956
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,480
A month or two.

957
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:25,900
A merchant paid 52 lakhs for
a goat in Delhi. - 52 lakhs.

958
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:29,820
If the Lord wills,
our merchant will pay more.

959
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,120
Yes.

960
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:34,040
You see,
there is only one angel.

961
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:37,460
If there is another buyer, the
price can increase too. - Yes.

962
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:41,750
No. I am just telling you.
You talk to him.

963
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:43,710
Yes.

964
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,090
Will you see him off
from the door?

965
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,340
Invite him in.
Come, let us go in.

966
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:49,840
Come.
- Please come.

967
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:52,220
Come on.
- Come on.

968
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,890
We will talk inside.
- Let's have tea.

969
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:05,150
What a change in two weeks,
sir!

970
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,700
What prosperity!
- It's a boon. - Here. Eat.

971
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:12,620
Ma'am, I was thinking..
- Don't think.

972
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,660
Majid, I was thinking..

973
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,460
I will ask Mr. Sheikh
to book my ticket for Saudi

974
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,460
along with that of Shahrukh.

975
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:25,210
He is used to this place.
Who will look after him there?

976
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:29,300
I thought I would accompany him.
- Can't my husband do that?

977
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,810
I am thinking about
earning 50 lakhs.

978
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:40,560
But if my husband also
accompanies Shahrukh

979
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:44,270
I am sure they pay goatherds
not less than the officers here.

980
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,860
Am I right?

981
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:50,280
And when you go there, find
a suitable groom for the girl.

982
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:53,410
After that, we will go on Haj.

983
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,540
Did you hear that?
You will go abroad.

984
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:58,750
All thanks to this kind fellow.

985
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:00,790
Yes, ma'am.

986
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,600
Hello, Mr. Swaran.
- Hello.

987
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:17,430
Where were you?
I haven't seen you in a while.

988
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,190
I had gone on a pilgrimage
with my wife.

989
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:22,270
Okay.
What did you ask from God?

990
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,900
No need to ask.
- Why?

991
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:28,940
I found out on my return.
It's his divine play.

992
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,320
I will leave now.
- Okay.

993
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,200
Take this, Shanti.

994
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:46,170
She is working so hard.
Let Sheikh come.

995
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:50,170
She will go to Saudi
and live like a queen.

996
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:52,340
Wear this after a bath.

997
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,140
Everything will be fine.

998
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:57,890
How are you?
- Sir?

999
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:59,520
All is well.

1000
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,730
How is the boy doing?

1001
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,520
Come on, go.

1002
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,400
Go!

1003
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:17,530
God made my
pilgrimage successful.

1004
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:18,700
Great!

1005
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:23,210
Where were you for so long, sir?
You were not to be seen.

1006
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,840
I returned yesterday.
- Okay. - From my pilgrimage.

1007
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:30,630
As soon as we came back,
my wife urged me

1008
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:34,470
to check on my grandson's
wellbeing.

1009
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,970
What is the news?
When is the Sheikh coming?

1010
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:45,440
What?
- 55 lakhs is not a small amount.

1011
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,730
Since a long time,
I wanted to buy some land.

1012
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:55,450
But you know.
Property prices are rising.

1013
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,490
And our earnings
are at rock bottom.

1014
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,490
Now all my hopes
are pinned on the child.

1015
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:05,790
What is this about your child?
As if you begot the goat.

1016
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,080
His mother might belong to you.

1017
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:11,380
But his father is
from our family.

1018
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:15,430
We have a right.
We do have it.

1019
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:16,800
Am I right?

1020
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:19,760
What father? What right
are you talking about?

1021
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:23,640
My Kalia is Shahrukh' s father.
- Kalia?

1022
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,440
What new story is this?

1023
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,860
Majid. - Yes.
- You were there.

1024
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:33,490
When Kalia and your goat..
What is her name? - Salma.

1025
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:34,940
Yes. Salma.

1026
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:40,120
When Kalia and Salma united.

1027
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,290
Disgusting. Even after
undertaking a pilgrimage

1028
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:45,830
you don't have the sense
to talk in front of women.

1029
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:50,840
Why? What did I say? All of
you were at the vet's clinic.

1030
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:54,260
When Kalia and Salma united..
- Stop it.

1031
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:56,760
Both of you just keep
listening like useless fellows.

1032
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,800
He is talking nonsense in
front of your wife and daughter.

1033
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:00,600
And both of you just keep quiet.

1034
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,060
Nobody came when we
were cleaning the goat feces.

1035
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:04,720
Now everyone wants
a share in the 55 lakhs.

1036
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,440
She is right. Mind your tongue.

1037
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:10,310
Fine. Fine.

1038
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:13,860
Let's settle the money issue..

1039
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:18,780
Look, Shahrukh is ours.
- His father is ours.

1040
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:22,030
And 55 lakhs are ours.
- Yes.

1041
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,300
Hello.
- Come. Come, Shyama Prasad.

1042
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:43,470
God bless you.
Come. Take the offering.

1043
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,940
Come, Shyama Prasad. Come.

1044
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:57,820
How are you?
- Fine.

1045
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,570
Everything is fine? - Yes.
I have some good news for you.

1046
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,830
Is it that you have become
a father for the sixth time?

1047
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:09,660
You always tease me.
- Tell me. What is it?

1048
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:11,830
I have brought
someone to meet you.

1049
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:16,170
He could be our trump
card in the elections.

1050
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,550
Sir, touch his feet.
He is my elder brother.

1051
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:22,840
It's okay. It's okay.

1052
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:24,510
It's okay. It's okay.

1053
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,430
Whom have you brought,
Shyama Prasad?

1054
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,520
Sir. Sir, it's enough.
- Shyama Prasad, you are..

1055
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,100
Come. Stand up.

1056
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,650
He is Swaran Singh.
He is from my village Sirauni.

1057
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,940
Mangori and Sirauni are in the
vicinity. He is like my uncle.

1058
01:03:37,070 --> 01:03:38,490
Come to the point,
Shyama Prasad.

1059
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:44,200
The thing is that

1060
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,290
magical goat Shahrukh..

1061
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:53,120
The one that cost us
the municipal body elections.

1062
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:56,210
The father of the goat..

1063
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,170
It's Kalia, right?
- Yes, Kalia.

1064
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,090
His name is Kalia.
He belongs to Swaran.

1065
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:02,510
How is this relevant?

1066
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:08,100
Sir,
if the father is a Hindu..

1067
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,810
How can the diabolic
lay claim on the goat?

1068
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,110
Now you see the relevance?

1069
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:23,660
What about the Arabic
lettering on his body?

1070
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,370
What about the Arabic lettering?

1071
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:31,450
Sir,
so what if there is no symbol?

1072
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:33,540
But his blood is of a Hindu.

1073
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,920
You can get the
medical test done

1074
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:39,300
in front of the whole village.
- We can do that as well.

1075
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:45,680
The child will clear the exams.
Make the offering. Leave!

1076
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:48,600
How are you, priest?
- I am fine. Hello.

1077
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,220
Hello. Is Suraiyya at home?
- Yes.

1078
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:55,150
Shall I call her? Suraiyya. Suraiyya.
- Yes.

1079
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:00,820
How are you, Suraiyya?
- Fine.

1080
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:06,410
With God's grace, we've
repaid all your money.

1081
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,280
What brings you here?

1082
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:10,450
Isn't this Shahrukh?
- Yes.

1083
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:11,790
It is so adorable.

1084
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:14,210
Ask, sir. You can ask
for whatever you want.

1085
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:15,330
Come. Come.
- Yes.

1086
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:17,420
Come. Come.

1087
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,500
Don't be scared.
He is God's messiah.

1088
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:25,550
Give whatever you want.

1089
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:31,770
Keep it.

1090
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:37,690
Suraiyya, he is the bank manager.
Gupta sir.

1091
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,440
All the accounts of
our NGO are with his bank.

1092
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:44,360
He has come especially
to meet you guys.

1093
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:48,160
Hello.
Pleased to meet you.

1094
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,120
These..

1095
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:00,170
These are the account
and fixed deposit forms.

1096
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:05,220
You can't keep 50 lakhs at home,
can you?

1097
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:06,880
We don't have 50 lakhs.

1098
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:08,720
No. You will get it.

1099
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:11,300
Look, ATM

1100
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:15,020
locker, fixed deposits,
net banking

1101
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:17,310
phone banking..
You will get all the facilities.

1102
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:18,940
Without charges.

1103
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:23,900
How are you, Majid?
- Fine.

1104
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,900
He is Suraiyya's husband.

1105
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:29,530
Hello, sir. Pleased to meet you.

1106
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:33,080
Myself Vibhuti Bhushan Gupta.
Manager of BMZ bank.

1107
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,830
Why are you panting?

1108
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:37,620
The village council
has summoned us.

1109
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:41,000
With Shahrukh.
- Oh Lord! Why?

1110
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:42,460
I don't know.

1111
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:48,090
Chief, we are waiting
for your decision.

1112
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,720
It's a clear-cut case.

1113
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:55,270
How come?
We raised him like a child.

1114
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:58,270
And today,
people are laying claim on him.

1115
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:00,400
You did it for your benefit.

1116
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:02,900
Otherwise, you guys
would have sacrificed

1117
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,820
him on Eid.
- Sir, hold on.

1118
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:08,360
Chief, understand one thing.

1119
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:11,660
It's the question
of our religion's honor.

1120
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:15,240
If the need arises,
we will move the Parliament

1121
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:17,160
leave alone the Supreme Court.
Get that straight.

1122
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:21,830
So what are we here for?

1123
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,460
So what are you waiting for?

1124
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,920
As far as the truth of
Shahrukh' s birth is concerned

1125
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:28,340
Majid has also confirmed it.
Why don't you speak up, Majid?

1126
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:33,350
What? - If you need more proof,
if you want more truth..

1127
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:35,720
Check with the Sirauni
veterinary hospital

1128
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:38,100
about Shahrukh' s bloodline.

1129
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,270
We don't know about
Kalia and Salma's ancestors.

1130
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:52,490
If a Catholic comes
in the future

1131
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:56,160
and we get to know that
they are Christian by birth

1132
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:00,330
it will complicate
the matter further.

1133
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:04,710
Another thing.
There is no greed in us.

1134
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:07,380
Because Mr. Swaran
has promised

1135
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,550
that he will donate more
than half the money he gets

1136
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:13,340
to the Goddess's temple.

1137
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:16,810
Glory to the Goddess!
- Yes. So what's the big deal?

1138
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:19,140
On the first day itself,
Majid had said

1139
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:20,730
that he will give more than half

1140
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:22,060
the money to the
mosque and school.

1141
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,060
You are behind all this?

1142
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,020
Look, chief and gentlemen.

1143
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:30,610
This sacred symbol
is the proof of our claim.

1144
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,200
So the money earned from him

1145
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,070
will be used in the
name of the Lord. - Yes.

1146
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,580
Our Gods will have
to go empty-handed?

1147
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:38,740
Because of a symbol..

1148
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:44,750
Lord! Lord!

1149
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:46,750
Lord!

1150
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:50,300
Glory to Lord Shiv Shambhu!
Lord Bholenath.

1151
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:55,800
It's Lord Bholenath himself.

1152
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,810
What happened?
- What are you doing?

1153
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:03,690
I will offer my head to Goddess.

1154
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:08,310
If anyone swears
on Lord Bholenath

1155
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,900
and says that this symbol

1156
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:15,820
is not Bholenath' s trident.

1157
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:18,700
What nonsense!
- Glory to Lord Shiva!

1158
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:21,080
Glory to Mahadev!

1159
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,960
Say, glory to Mahadev!

1160
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:29,790
Glory to Mahadev!
- Glory to Allah! Glory to Mahadev!

1161
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,010
Glory to Allah!
- Allah is great!

1162
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:35,340
Glory to Allah!
- Allah is great!

1163
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:40,640
Silence. Silence.

1164
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,310
Silence. Silence.

1165
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,810
What is this?
Is this a council or a joke?

1166
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,230
Glory to Allah!
Glory to Mahadev!

1167
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,110
It's a complicated matter.

1168
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:04,540
So the decision can't
be taken in haste.

1169
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,840
So..

1170
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:19,300
The council has decided that

1171
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:25,430
until the Sheikh comes here

1172
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,940
or some other
decision is taken

1173
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:34,440
Shahrukh will remain
in the council's custody.

1174
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:40,320
Chief.
- And neither of the parties

1175
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:43,620
will exercise
their right on him.

1176
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,370
This is the council's decision. Enough.
- Chief, he is our child.

1177
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,460
We don't accept it.
- It is the council's decision.

1178
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:53,420
Silence.
The council ends here.

1179
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,550
All of you go. Go home.

1180
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:57,340
We don't accept your decision.
- It is our goat.

1181
01:10:57,470 --> 01:11:00,510
It is our goat. - It is ours.
Allah is written on it.

1182
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,350
Come on. We won't leave.

1183
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:03,470
We won't accept it.
- Silence.

1184
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:13,820
Naaz,
I have told you so many times.

1185
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:15,610
Don't call me
while I am working.

1186
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:16,900
What is going on?

1187
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,240
Nothing.
Everything will be fine.

1188
01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:21,280
When?
And how will it be alright?

1189
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:23,160
Such things happen
in the council meeting.

1190
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,040
Don't be afraid.
Nothing will happen.

1191
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,240
Nothing will happen?

1192
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:28,960
This betrayer also
had to show his color now.

1193
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:32,460
We don't even know whether
he is a Hindu or a Muslim.

1194
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:34,960
That's not true.
He is a messiah.

1195
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:38,630
The entire village
accepts his powers. Right?

1196
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:39,920
So what do we do?

1197
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:42,590
Nothing will happen.
Don't worry.

1198
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,930
I will do something.

1199
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:45,470
Look,
you will have to do something,

1200
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,640
Jaffer. You don't understand.
Or else..

1201
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:49,230
What will happen of us?

1202
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:57,780
Everyone is burning
with jealousy.

1203
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,820
The things they said
in the council meeting.

1204
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,030
What happened?

1205
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:07,950
The shopkeeper has
refused to take eggs. - Why?

1206
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,120
He says these are infernal eggs.
- What?

1207
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:16,170
He said those who eat
them will incur a curse.

1208
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:19,340
They will be born as
Muslims in their next birth.

1209
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:20,880
All are scoundrels.

1210
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:23,220
Let it be. Don't worry.

1211
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,760
We have made the arrangement.

1212
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:27,470
We have found a solution.
Got it?

1213
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,890
We are trying to
call up the Sheikh.

1214
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,940
Once he finds out, everything
will be resolved. - What?

1215
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,360
What? Are you crazy?

1216
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:42,360
You want to ruin everything.
- Give the phone back.

1217
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:43,530
We have to call up Mr. Sheikh.

1218
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:46,450
What are you doing?
Get the phone out. Get it out.

1219
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:48,700
You have burned the phone.

1220
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:33,200
Majid! Majid!

1221
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:34,910
Majid!

1222
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:39,210
Hello, Majid.
- Hello.

1223
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:42,010
You know that assembly elections
are round the corner.

1224
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:44,220
The party has
always stood by you.

1225
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:47,470
This time you have got a chance
to show your loyalty.

1226
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:50,560
If you had got money
from the Sheikh

1227
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:53,810
and the people had
not been confused

1228
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,440
by the trident symbol claims

1229
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,940
we would have had
great expectations from you.

1230
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:01,650
But seeing your situation

1231
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:03,570
we have fixed the
amount of Rs. 25,000.

1232
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:06,570
Rs.25,000? - Rizwan has
especially instructed that

1233
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:08,320
Shahrukh' s absence
doesn't matter.

1234
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:10,700
The priest's hands are blessed.

1235
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:12,540
So we are to take
the money from him.

1236
01:14:20,130 --> 01:14:24,920
Chief, I was saying that you
have still not found a solution.

1237
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,470
We have to pay for
Shahrukh' s upkeep every day.

1238
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:30,640
So.. - Why?

1239
01:14:31,890 --> 01:14:34,890
Until now you have enjoyed
Shahrukh' s earnings.

1240
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:39,060
Swaran Singh is waiting
with cash in hand.

1241
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,150
He is ready to pay
for Shahrukh' s maintenance.

1242
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:45,650
If that weakens your case..
- No, chief.

1243
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:47,820
Our child is not a burden on us.

1244
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:49,610
We can afford to
take care of him. Yes.

1245
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:51,950
Chief,
don't worry about the money.

1246
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,080
Feed him well. Feed him well.

1247
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,330
Majid, there is a call
for you at Shastri's place.

1248
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,210
What?
- Call for you.

1249
01:14:58,330 --> 01:15:00,580
Okay.
- Bye. Bye. - Come on.

1250
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:21,810
Pick it up..

1251
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:25,860
Hello.

1252
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:29,950
Yes..
This is the priest.

1253
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,240
Yes.

1254
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:32,700
Who?

1255
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,120
Give it to Majid?

1256
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:38,460
Majid is unwell.
He has diarrhea.

1257
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:39,620
Yes.

1258
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:42,710
Mobile?
It got burned.

1259
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:45,840
Yes. Okay.

1260
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:49,220
What? Yes.

1261
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,430
Bye.

1262
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:55,720
Hello.

1263
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,520
Junior Sheikh was very angry.

1264
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:01,310
With great difficulty he got

1265
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,270
the number from
the telephone exchange.

1266
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:08,860
What did he say?

1267
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:12,320
Sheikh is coming next week.

1268
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:13,820
What?
- Yes.

1269
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,240
The council members
will have to be quick.

1270
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:18,040
To heck with them!

1271
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:20,540
Even if they declare
Shahrukh to be a Hindu

1272
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:23,330
Sheikh would still not care.

1273
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,800
Who better than
Sheikh to spot a messiah?

1274
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,670
The Quran originated from there.

1275
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,300
Am I right, priest?

1276
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:34,090
Let's go home.
- Yes.

1277
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:36,300
Come on. Come on.
- Let's go.

1278
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:08,290
Hello, ma'am.

1279
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:11,460
Sir..
I am also there.

1280
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:14,430
Hello, priest.
- Hello.

1281
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:17,970
Are you going somewhere, ma'am?

1282
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:20,060
Yes, child.
I am going to my mother's place.

1283
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:21,810
It's better than
going to prison.

1284
01:17:23,730 --> 01:17:25,940
Prison?
What are you saying, ma'am?

1285
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:28,940
I have brought sweets
for all of you.

1286
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:35,530
I have got a job in
a big salon in Mumbai.

1287
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:38,450
That's great news, child!

1288
01:17:38,830 --> 01:17:41,200
Child, take me along with you.
- Yes. Everyone can go.

1289
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:44,830
I am here to get
beaten by the police.

1290
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:46,290
Police?

1291
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:49,340
What's the matter?

1292
01:17:52,090 --> 01:17:53,090
Sir, what is the matter?

1293
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:57,640
Mr. Sheikh is coming.

1294
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,430
Now what to do?
We can't stay here.

1295
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:04,810
But why to leave the village?

1296
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:08,360
What if he finds out
Shahrukh' s truth?

1297
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,320
Shahrukh' s truth?

1298
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:12,690
That his father Kalia
is a non-Muslim.

1299
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:16,070
Now they are saying, he is
the incarnation of Lord Shiva.

1300
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,740
Trident. God forbid.

1301
01:18:18,370 --> 01:18:21,530
Who knows what decision
the council will take, and when?

1302
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,200
Priest, that's a good thing.

1303
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:25,960
What's the worse
that will happen?

1304
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:28,170
Mr. Sheikh won't take
Shahrukh with him.

1305
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,880
The matter will end.
It's good.

1306
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:32,750
Yes. And then we
will go to prison.

1307
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:34,260
Why prison?

1308
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:37,970
Sir, the claim not being
proven is not an offense.

1309
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:40,470
But not returning 50,000
is a crime, isn't it?

1310
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,260
You took money?

1311
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:47,350
We asked for an advance.
And he immediately agreed.

1312
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:49,230
Ask them where the money went.

1313
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,400
Ma'am, where is the money?

1314
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,780
Only Rs. 5,000 is left.
- What?

1315
01:18:55,150 --> 01:18:58,660
Forget that.
No one cared for me here.

1316
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:00,700
You hardly will, when
I go to my mother's place.

1317
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:03,580
But where did such
a hefty sum go?

1318
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:06,830
The party workers took
away half as donation.

1319
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,330
Okay. I am going.
I won't stay here.

1320
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:13,090
Come on. Pick up the bags.
Pack your bags.

1321
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,130
Yes. Go to the city.

1322
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:25,390
Fine. If this is the matter

1323
01:19:28,270 --> 01:19:29,560
let's leave together.

1324
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:30,650
What?
- What?

1325
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:33,520
Yes. Come on.

1326
01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:46,490
Why is it taking so long?
Where are they?

1327
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,580
Did that boy run away again?

1328
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,420
Where will he go?
As it is, Shahrukh is not..

1329
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:53,080
Don't take that wretch's name.

1330
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:55,300
We are in trouble
because of him.

1331
01:19:57,010 --> 01:19:59,470
I am sure something is wrong.
- Yes.

1332
01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:01,300
Why are you worried?
He will come.

1333
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:03,930
What do you mean?
We need to get away.

1334
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:05,850
You don't understand. - We will
leave. Everything will be fine.

1335
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:07,680
With God's grace everything
will be fine. Don't worry.

1336
01:20:07,810 --> 01:20:10,890
Look, a vehicle is coming.
- They are there.

1337
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,230
Stop. Pull over.
- Look. Get up.

1338
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:14,440
See whose vehicle it is?

1339
01:20:15,070 --> 01:20:18,110
It's ours!
Come on. Let's go.

1340
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:19,690
Pick up the bags.

1341
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:23,820
Pick it up.
- Has everyone come?

1342
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,240
Come on.
- Let's go.

1343
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:28,830
The luggage.. Ma'am,
all of you get into the vehicle.

1344
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:30,410
I will load the bags.

1345
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:31,500
Okay.
- All of you sit comfortably.

1346
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:34,790
Okay.
- Sit. Sit. Come on. Let's go.

1347
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,880
Wait. - Why are you sitting
in the front? Let him sit.

1348
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,260
Priest.
- Come on.

1349
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:41,010
You sit.
Ma'am, I am there.

1350
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:43,340
Let him sit. We youngsters
will sit in the rear.

1351
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:46,140
He will manage. Let's go.
- Hurry up. Come on.

1352
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:47,310
Get in. Get in.
- Sit comfortably.

1353
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:50,140
Sit. Come on.

1354
01:20:54,190 --> 01:20:55,230
Come. Come, lad. Very good.

1355
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:58,020
May God bless you
with prosperity, lad.

1356
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,570
Not prosperity.
Just a beautiful girl. Yes.

1357
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:03,450
Get that bag too.

1358
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:06,740
Okay. Come on.

1359
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:09,580
Come on. Let's go.

1360
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:33,690
Murli, what happened?

1361
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:36,060
I don't know. The vehicle is not
starting. I need the tool box.

1362
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,820
Is that so? I will give you.
I know where the tool box is.

1363
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:39,940
Wait.

1364
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,440
Take this.

1365
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:47,030
The goat has also come along?

1366
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,450
What happened?
- What's going on?

1367
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:51,290
Repair the vehicle. Repair
the vehicle. Repair the vehicle.

1368
01:21:51,410 --> 01:21:53,910
Why did you bring him?
Why did you bring him?

1369
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,210
Say something.

1370
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:58,840
What have you done?

1371
01:21:59,090 --> 01:22:00,130
Oh, God!

1372
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:04,380
Zulfi, are you crazy?
- Don't scold Zulfi.

1373
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,970
You have put us
in serious trouble.

1374
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:12,390
People think he is God.

1375
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,890
We had to flee at night
because of this wretch.

1376
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:17,020
Don't scold Shahrukh.
- Beware!

1377
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:20,320
If he had not been there,
we wouldn't have been slandered.

1378
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,730
He didn't do anything.
We did it.

1379
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:24,820
What?
- What did you do?

1380
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:26,820
Zulfi is right.

1381
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:30,830
We made this symbol on Shahrukh.

1382
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:37,330
I made it.
- What?

1383
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,340
You made this symbol?

1384
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,670
Yes. I wrote 'Lord' on him.

1385
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:46,970
Oh God!

1386
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:49,720
What else could I do?

1387
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:52,260
You wanted to sell Shahrukh.

1388
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,310
Zulfi didn't want him
to go anywhere.

1389
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:59,190
Zulfi wanted Shahrukh.
All of you wanted money.

1390
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:02,570
Why didn't both of you tell us
for so many days?

1391
01:23:03,070 --> 01:23:04,360
What will happen now?

1392
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:08,070
Nothing will happen.
Everyone knows the truth.

1393
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:09,950
Let's return to the village.

1394
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:14,450
Shut up!
- What? You are a fool!

1395
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:19,120
What do we do now?
- What else?

1396
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:21,080
We will do what we were doing.
Let's flee.

1397
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:23,840
Murli, did you fix the vehicle?
Yes, sir. The vehicle has been fixed.

1398
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,630
Come on. Sit in the vehicle.
Let's go. Hurry up.

1399
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:27,260
Zulfi, come on.

1400
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:28,880
Come on. Sit in the vehicle.

1401
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:30,180
Ma'am.
- Come on. - Sir.

1402
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:33,560
Get him in.
- Yes, priest. You sit as well.

1403
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:42,400
Let's go.
- Hurry up.

1404
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:43,570
Murli.

1405
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:46,940
"O' Prince.. You'll not be spared."

1406
01:23:47,070 --> 01:23:50,240
"O' Prince.. You'll not be spared."

1407
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:53,530
"Forget the wedding or love.
It's all in ruins now."

1408
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:59,830
"You lost your way.
Love has made you blind."

1409
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:05,130
"You lost your way.
Love has made you blind."

1410
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:20,060
"Look, who has come."

1411
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:24,060
"He has captured the world."

1412
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:28,110
"Everyone's eyes are on him."

1413
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:32,160
"Arms have opened for him."

1414
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:45,460
"Recognize me. I am Don."

1415
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:46,750
Sir.

1416
01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:49,210
Let us pass, sir.

1417
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:50,550
What?
- Let us pass.

1418
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:54,140
Show the papers.
- They are in the car.

1419
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:57,010
So bring them.

1420
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:02,980
What do you think?
Can we extract something?

1421
01:25:04,230 --> 01:25:05,400
We will.

1422
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,690
Looks like the police
have found out everything.

1423
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:13,150
What nonsense! Keep quiet.

1424
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,120
You don't have any brains.
You just keep talking nonsense.

1425
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,450
Keep quiet. They are coming.
- Keep quiet.

1426
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:25,920
From where?
- Who?

1427
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:29,750
From which village
is your father from?

1428
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:31,170
Mangori.

1429
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:35,840
Where are you going?

1430
01:25:36,510 --> 01:25:38,600
We are going to Mumbai, sir.

1431
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:44,020
Come on. Come out.

1432
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:51,530
Hello, sir.
Sir, there are women.

1433
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:55,610
We will check who are behind
the veil. Men or women.

1434
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:58,200
Hurry up.
- Sir, I am from Mumbai.

1435
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,450
I work in Mumbai. Hair stylist.

1436
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:03,120
They are my relatives.

1437
01:26:03,710 --> 01:26:04,660
They are coming
to Mumbai with me.

1438
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:06,460
I see. So you are the leader.

1439
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,710
Where do you work in Mumbai?

1440
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,710
You make bombs?
- Barber.

1441
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:13,630
You make bombs,
acid and its likes in Mumbai.

1442
01:26:14,050 --> 01:26:16,090
What is in the vehicle?
- Nothing, sir. Household stuff.

1443
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:17,220
Move. Show us. Show us. Show us.

1444
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:18,800
RDX?
- No, sir.

1445
01:26:18,970 --> 01:26:20,970
Provisions. Clothes.
Nothing else.

1446
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,140
What if there is
really a bomb inside?

1447
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:27,690
What if it explodes?

1448
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:29,270
What are you saying, sir?

1449
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:30,570
Is that possible?

1450
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:32,230
Anything can happen.

1451
01:26:33,490 --> 01:26:34,490
Didn't you see the old man?

1452
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:37,740
He looks like Osama
Bin Laden's brother.

1453
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:41,490
That Osama?
- Yes. That very Osama.

1454
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,160
What do we do?

1455
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:46,870
Hero. Come here.

1456
01:26:47,330 --> 01:26:48,460
Open the door.

1457
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:51,380
Open it.
- Open it. Open it.

1458
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,800
I am opening it, sir.
- Shall I hit you? No.

1459
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:55,300
Open it.

1460
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,140
Sir, it is a goat.
- What?

1461
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:05,600
There is a goat and a child.

1462
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:09,520
Tell me. Tell me.
Who is behind this? No.

1463
01:27:09,650 --> 01:27:13,270
Sir, are they going
to create trouble? No.

1464
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,190
Whatever it is.
We can't take a chance.

1465
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:18,660
The minister's function
is not far from here.

1466
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:21,910
The minister is expected
to stay there for two hours.

1467
01:27:22,530 --> 01:27:25,250
Meanwhile, let them remain here.

1468
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:28,330
They will stay here until
the function is over.

1469
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:31,670
Arrest everyone
whom you suspect.

1470
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:35,050
We will verify later who is
innocent and who is guilty.

1471
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:40,510
Provide them with all the treatment.
- Sir. Sir, he has fever.

1472
01:27:40,930 --> 01:27:43,890
Look, how he is reclining. If
you could give him some drug..

1473
01:27:44,930 --> 01:27:46,310
I mean, medicine.

1474
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:48,140
That's the medicine we offer.

1475
01:27:48,690 --> 01:27:50,520
Look. Take a good look.

1476
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:53,230
This man is a smart chap.

1477
01:27:53,730 --> 01:27:54,690
He has gone to sleep.

1478
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:57,570
Listen, find yourself a corner.

1479
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:59,530
Come on.

1480
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,280
Something is fishy.

1481
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:05,490
I have an experience
of 30 years.

1482
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:08,120
I can sense it.

1483
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:10,460
No, sir.
- Sir

1484
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:15,130
we had a doubt when
we opened the door.

1485
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:18,720
We thought we would
find RDX, bombs.

1486
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:23,050
Instead, we found a goat.
All are fools.

1487
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:25,220
If they are fools,
we will let them go

1488
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,310
once the minister leaves.

1489
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:29,100
We have got orders
from our superiors.

1490
01:28:30,230 --> 01:28:31,690
Can't afford to take risk.

1491
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:33,310
That's it.

1492
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:36,360
Sir, we need to frisk the goat.

1493
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:38,860
Frisk the goat?
- Of course.

1494
01:28:42,490 --> 01:28:44,780
Oh my!
Must weigh 15 kgs.

1495
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:46,580
What is the market rate?

1496
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,080
I don't know.

1497
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:50,830
I asked my wife to make
'biryani' once.

1498
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:53,250
She said, she would
break my bones.

1499
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:55,880
We can't afford eggs
with our salary.

1500
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:57,800
Mutton is beyond our reach.

1501
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,380
Here is your chance.

1502
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:02,800
Biryani. Kebab. Curry.

1503
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:04,800
First, frisk the goat.

1504
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:07,930
You don't know,
they fit it anywhere.

1505
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:09,810
You are right.

1506
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:12,140
Shinde, shove the stick inside.

1507
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:13,560
See if it explodes.

1508
01:29:18,190 --> 01:29:19,820
Hold him.
- It is running.

1509
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:22,070
Yes. - Wait. Come here.
- Stop.

1510
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:23,950
What is this?

1511
01:29:25,030 --> 01:29:27,370
Oh my! Seems to be
some secret code. - Yes.

1512
01:29:27,530 --> 01:29:29,410
What is going on?
- See this.

1513
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:30,620
Can you crack this code?

1514
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:34,330
Code?

1515
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,460
Oh God!

1516
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:38,420
You all will be cursed.

1517
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:40,460
Whom have you tied?

1518
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:42,010
Why? Any problem?

1519
01:29:42,130 --> 01:29:44,260
Have all of you gone blind?

1520
01:29:45,140 --> 01:29:47,680
You have tied the Lord.

1521
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:50,060
The Lord?
- What nonsense!

1522
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:53,350
Not nonsense. A manifestation
of the Lord himself.

1523
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:54,940
Look. Look carefully.

1524
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:56,900
Yes. There is something.
- Yes.

1525
01:29:57,020 --> 01:29:58,940
Really.
- Oh God!

1526
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,190
And you wanted to eat biryani?

1527
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:04,360
O' Lord, I made a mistake.

1528
01:30:04,530 --> 01:30:06,950
I didn't know God
would come here like this.

1529
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,660
How did you not see
such a big trident?

1530
01:30:12,370 --> 01:30:14,870
Oh God! All will be cursed.

1531
01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:18,380
God, forgive us this time.
We won't do this again.

1532
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:22,630
Glory to the Lord!

1533
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:24,670
Iqbal, untie him quickly.

1534
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,260
Glory to the Lord!
- Glory to the Lord!

1535
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:28,720
Praise the Lord!

1536
01:30:28,850 --> 01:30:32,060
Keep this Hindu-Muslim unity
for later. First, untie him.

1537
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:33,730
Glory to the Lord!
- Glory to the Lord!

1538
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:36,350
Glory to the Lord!
- Glory to the Lord!

1539
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,270
Why reverse circumambulation?

1540
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:41,320
We do reverse circumambulation
for atonement.

1541
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:42,820
This is how we will
get rid of the sin.

1542
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:44,940
Glory to the Lord!
Glory to the Lord!

1543
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:47,450
Glory to the Lord!
- Glory to the Lord!

1544
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:49,410
Glory to the Lord!
- Glory to the Lord!

1545
01:30:49,530 --> 01:30:51,030
Glory to the Lord!
- Glory to the Lord!

1546
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:52,580
Glory to the Lord!
- Glory to the Lord!

1547
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:54,870
Glory to the Lord!

1548
01:30:59,710 --> 01:31:04,090
Glory to the Lord!
- Glory to the Lord!

1549
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:27,610
The chaos continues.

1550
01:31:29,070 --> 01:31:31,120
Wonder what Shahrukh
thinks about all of this.

1551
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:35,540
Human logic is beyond reason.

1552
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:37,500
Shahrukh is just Shahrukh.

1553
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:51,260
Roll camera..
And action!

1554
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:14,330
"You are both alien and
acquaintance to me.."

1555
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:23,750
"You are both alien
and acquaintance to me.."

1556
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:28,260
"Your boon transforms
coal into a diamond."

1557
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:32,140
