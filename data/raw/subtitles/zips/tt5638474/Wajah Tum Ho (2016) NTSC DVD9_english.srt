1
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:21,210
Those are tears of joy, right?

2
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:22,311
Show me..

3
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:25,842
Salt'!-

4
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,185
Trust me..l guarantee
all kinds of happiness.

5
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,883
This is my card.
ACP Ramesh Sarnayak.

6
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:38,987
Day and Night service.

7
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,234
I'm comfortable mostly at night.

8
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:53,908
Sorry.

9
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:55,936
"Took longer than I expected.

10
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,211
Nice girlfriend.

11
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,075
She's a bit emotional.

12
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,316
How did she fall for
a drug-addict like you?

13
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,822
Sir, we were not taking drugs.

14
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,951
We just happened to be at the party?
- Hey..

15
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,255
Stop ranting in English, right.

16
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,989
Bloody ****

17
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,529
Your mother runs an NGO.

18
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:19,528
Father is a social
activist on news channel.

19
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,397
And were you giving
spiritual lessons.

20
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,308
...to the girl
on your car's backseat?

21
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,843
Ohhh..if you do it,
its enjoyment.

22
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,538
And if we do it, it's harassment.

23
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,885
You're from a good family.

24
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,855
You've already proved that.

25
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,413
...you care about your
parent's reputation.

26
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,483
Stop ruining your future.

27
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,986
Go in..go inside.

28
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,520
She's waiting for you.

29
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,862
Go on..

30
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:04,566
"I'm obsessed
aboutmaking you mine."

31
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,820
Karan sir, am I disturbing you?

32
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,257
Speak!

33
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,254
I haven't received my packet yet.

34
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:23,061
I've already paid you in full.

35
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:28,538
Look sir, crime and alcohol
become invaluable as they grow old.

36
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,069
Don't they?

37
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:31,842
It was a big mistake.

38
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,904
...to think that a cunning
basm like you would be loyal.

39
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,916
Loyal as a dog sir..

40
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,983
Have I ever given
you a chance to complain?

41
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,578
You won't anymore.

42
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,513
I am going to settle
your account once and for all.

43
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,150
I hope you mean that, sir.

44
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,223
And you're not furious with me.

45
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,067
Bloody ***

46
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:05,941
"..come closer and.."

47
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,343
Who..who are you?

48
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,145
Who are you?

49
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,646
I think we're hacked.

50
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,573
Cheap
death by expensive petrol.

51
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,474
A chilling
death which may make your soul shiver.

52
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:42,979
How
and when this happened?

53
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,272
This
murder of a police officer.

54
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,876
...seems
entangled like a thread.

55
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,219
A murder
as gruesome as most foul.

56
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,588
Probably one of
the saddest in the history of crime.

57
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,786
And we've news that Global
Time Network CEO Mr. Rahul Oberoi..

58
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,863
"The media mogul.
Has been asked for questioning.

59
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:06,766
Death on rampage.

60
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,372
Grimm
Reapers have a ball.

61
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,704
Is Rahul Oberoi the
mastermind behind all this?

62
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,935
Yes..the same Rahul
Oberoi who owns Global Times Network.

63
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:29,993
Sir..sir..

64
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,993
ACP Sarnaik was murdered on channel,
What do you have to say about it, sir?

65
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:57,287
Who dared to summon me
here like a ordinary criminal?

66
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:01,986
Do you guys have any idea who I am?

67
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:08,692
Your minister's on my payroll.

68
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:20,641
Well sir,
who is on whose payroll..

69
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,880
...that's strictly between you two.

70
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,418
That's strictly personal.

71
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,412
We're just doing our job.

72
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:34,986
I am Rahul Oberoi.
The CEO of Global Times Network!

73
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:39,422
India's most
power-ful..media house.

74
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:40,824
Big fan.

75
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:42,499
Big fan!

76
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,367
I am Kabir Deshmukh.

77
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:48,439
A humble servant of India's strongest
and most effective Police force.

78
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,330
Mumbai Police.

79
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,713
How dare you call me here?

80
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,548
Every minute of mine
is worth millions.

81
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,680
You should respect time,
not put a price-tag on it.

82
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:10,651
Sir, I've done some research.

83
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,093
Correct me if I am wrong.

84
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:16,023
Your ratings were
falling..profits were falling.

85
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,124
You were losing
credibility in the market.

86
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:19,731
And then..this cheap stunt.

87
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:21,873
Live Murder on Television!

88
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:23,997
Was it your idea?

89
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:25,835
Absolutely right.

90
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,077
Congratulations.

91
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,378
You just solved the entire case.

92
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,740
Must be my idea.

93
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:35,511
I pay millions in salary to creative
directors, editors and program heads.

94
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,915
...so that they give me
such out-of-the-box ideas..

95
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,785
...and the ratings
of my TV channel soar.

96
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:43,754
And then I throw a
grand party..in Tihar Jail.

97
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,758
Actually sir,
if you do go to jail..

98
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,827
...you'll be sent to Yerwada jail.

99
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,122
Next question.

100
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,525
If not you..

101
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:53,526
"Then who?

102
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,128
We were hacked.

103
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,066
How do you know?

104
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,076
We've done our research, officer.

105
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,446
You can talk to
my technical head Mak.

106
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,735
He's in Delhi right now.

107
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:03,872
But he's arriving
by the evening flight.

108
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,040
Sir..let's take this step-by-step.

109
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:07,780
Let's deal with you first.

110
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,577
I've an entire question
paper prepared for you.

111
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:13,154
Officer, stay within your limits.

112
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,484
Don't cross your limit.
- Limit?

113
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,856
We just saw your limit
live on your Television channel.

114
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,458
But you haven't
seen our limit yet.

115
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:29,168
Pray to God that you're
as innocent as you claim to be.

116
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,506
Gaitonde.
- Yes, sir.

117
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:35,502
Set the AC to 18
..he's sweating.

118
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:37,104
Right?

119
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:42,046
Now, as the
proceedings continue, all we know..

120
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,951
...is that Rahul Oberoi is
still being questioned inside.

121
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,590
And
we all are clueless.

122
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,050
So sir, you have no clue.

123
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:52,929
You didn't know
ACP Sarnaik as well.

124
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,595
You don't suspect any
of your rival channels either.

125
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,664
You're just a honest
tax-paying citizen.

126
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,506
You don't know how your
systems were hacked either.

127
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:03,768
Mak does.

128
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,537
Basically you have no clue.

129
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,943
Sir, if this continues any longer,
we can come to only one conclusion.

130
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:14,918
Either you are..or someone's
making you look like one big..

131
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,086
You're too under-qualified..

132
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:25,125
...to judge who or what I am,
officer.

133
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,527
Sir, you see..my
qualification is that.

134
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:38,031
...I can use my service revolver
on whoever..and whenever I want.

135
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:40,870
“With no questions asked.

136
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:48,178
You know what,
you're wasting my time.

137
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,249
An entire life got wasted
on Global Times Network.

138
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,681
An ACP has been murdered.

139
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,093
You will have to give us time.

140
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:01,593
Anyway,
it was a pleasure meeting you.

141
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,725
You must deposit your
passport with us and..

142
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,168
"This is my number, save it.

143
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:09,604
And please,
don't forward any cheap jokes.

144
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:14,872
Leave.

145
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,122
Where the hell is Siya.

146
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:39,160
Call her.
- Okay, sir.

147
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,720
Good morning, ma'am.
- Hi.

148
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,955
Good morning.
- Good morning.

149
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,057
Good morning, ma'am.
- Hi.

150
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,095
"And the Mumbai
Police has accused."

151
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,866
"..Global Times Network's
CEO Rahul Oberoi for this murder.."

152
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,767
I am a national scene now.

153
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,807
All these years I
lead the news business..

154
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,277
...and today I've become
some cheap news myself.

155
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,049
The media mogul
is on trial by media.

156
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,224
That bloody no-good
police officer.

157
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,226
...was treating me like
I was a pick-pocketeer.

158
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,786
I'm left all alone, Rahul.

159
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:15,025
You're not alone, Rahul.
I am there for you.

160
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,201
I am your legal head,
and you know I am good at my job.

161
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,701
Nothing will happen to you.

162
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,199
Siya, I will destroy
that bloody Kabir.

163
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,705
He thinks,
rather he believes that..

164
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,212
...I did this for ratings.

165
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,974
Did you do it..or not?

166
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,213
Siya, you're sounding
just like Kabir.

167
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,720
I've never met such a
crooked officer in my life.

168
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,256
He's not crooked, he's straight.

169
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:40,890
He has a clean record.

170
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,750
Don't confuse your ego with him.

171
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:45,262
I will buy him.
- He has no price-tag.

172
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,295
Just relax, Rahul.

173
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,727
Just follow protocol,
and do as I say.

174
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,734
As long as I am there,
no one can touch you.

175
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,046
And..what if I want to touch you?

176
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,256
Then you will lose this case,
Rahul Oberoi.

177
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,961
Let's pray..there's no sequel
or second episode to this live murder.

178
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,297
Talk to Mak..and ignore Kabir.

179
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:26,829
Ranvir.

180
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:31,891
How did you know?

181
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,872
Even the fragrance
of all these flowers.

182
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:41,139
"Cannot deluge
your fragrance, Ranvir.

183
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:50,315
Then give this fragrance
a place of refuge.

184
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:55,184
If I am the rain..

185
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:58,858
"Then let me shower on you.

186
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:05,026
The rain doesn't need
anyone's permission.

187
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,901
...to cascade from the clouds.

188
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,177
I love you.

189
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,016
It's been a year, Siya.

190
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,443
But I miss you every moment.

191
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:28,590
Then take me to some place.

192
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:32,886
...where we will
just love each other.

193
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:34,630
Close your eyes, Siya.

194
00:22:54,573 --> 00:23:04,017
"You're the one..who's
always close to my heart."

195
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:17,268
"You're the one..who's
always close to my heart."

196
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:25,666
"Life's a sweet craving..is
what you all say."

197
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:38,987
"You're the one..who's
always close to my heart."

198
00:23:56,202 --> 00:24:02,585
"Your veil..flutters over
my eyes <i>as</i> the sun sets."

199
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:09,115
"Each night fall brings..a
series of memories."

200
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:15,632
"Every time I draw a breath.
I can sense your fragrance."

201
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:22,195
"And brings
along..a sweet message."

202
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:29,246
"Even my
heanbeathums your tune."

203
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:38,744
"You're the one..who's
always close to my heart."

204
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:49,091
"You're the one..who's.."

205
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:24,200
"I saw you yesterday...
in my courtyard..."

206
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:30,671
"Seemed like you were saying,
hide me in your arms."

207
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:33,767
"What is this bond?"

208
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,240
"What are these dreams?"

209
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:43,718
"Even though you're a stranger,
you feel like a kin."

210
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:50,619
"I always think...and scared to say."

211
00:25:51,050 --> 00:26:00,494
"You're the one...
always close to my heart."

212
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:10,705
"You're the one...
always close to my heart."

213
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:21,489
Hi.

214
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,425
Late on a date.
You'll have to pay fine.

215
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,292
I am 'fine' with it, Suhani.

216
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:34,197
Would you convince
mom with muffins too?

217
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:35,369
No, sweetheart.

218
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:38,269
This muffin shop hadn't
open at that time.

219
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:40,199
You miss your mom.

220
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:42,570
Only when you come late.

221
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:45,113
Do you miss her?
- No ways.

222
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,480
After all..l get her share
of kisses and hugs too.

223
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:51,587
Nice try,
but I am still not talking to you.

224
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:52,485
Why?

225
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:57,321
A big green monster
came to my room last night.

226
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:58,862
And I was all alone in my room.

227
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:00,355
Oh my, God.

228
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,694
There were some complications
in my life, I am so sorry.

229
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,633
But tonight your green
monster is done for.

230
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:10,466
You think only your life's
complicated? Not mine?

231
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:12,702
I am the best dancer in the class.

232
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:15,675
But Archana miss didn't
put me in the centre.

233
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:20,816
Can your police force do
something about this..serious issue?

234
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,675
Sit down. Sit down.

235
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,650
The police force can't.

236
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:27,824
But your dad will advise
you to work harder.

237
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,623
Impress Archana miss.

238
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:32,786
And in your next concert
you will be the show-stopper.

239
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:34,826
Right?
' Very good.

240
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:36,593
Sorry. Just a minute.

241
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:37,598
Phone.

242
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:41,702
Yes, Gaitonde.
- Sir, we've found Mak.

243
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:44,704
Yes..l am coming.

244
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:45,673
Eat.

245
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:46,502
Okay?'-

246
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,737
You're leaving?

247
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,805
I am sorry, dear.

248
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:52,942
That dancer behind
stage has come up front.

249
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:58,678
But I promise, tonight we'll
arrest your green monster together.

250
00:27:58,744 --> 00:27:59,586
Okay?

251
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:00,621
Give me a five.

252
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:02,691
See you.

253
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,636
Jai Hind, sir.

254
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:20,205
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

255
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,911
Sir, we were waiting
for you..can we star-t now?

256
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,311
Mr. Rahul, good morning.

257
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:27,974
Did you sleep well?

258
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,719
This is Siya, my legal head.

259
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:34,224
And that is Mak, my technical head.

260
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:37,486
Mak.

261
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,218
Makrand Moge.

262
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:43,489
Can we star-t'?
- Wait, Mr. Rahul.

263
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,836
You just introduced me to your team.

264
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,771
"Now, how about you meet
our team-player as well.

265
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:58,440
Mr. Ranvir Bajaj,
State counselor on this case.

266
00:28:58,671 --> 00:28:59,809
Good morning, gentlemen.

267
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:04,419
And of course, lady.

268
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:09,390
I hope I've not missed anything.

269
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,824
No-no, we were waiting for you.

270
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,354
So good..we may star-t now.

271
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:18,698
So gentlemen, as we all
know that our network was hacked.

272
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:20,002
And it's a fact.

273
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:23,339
In order to prove this fact,
Mak has made a presentation.

274
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:25,939
I think after hearing that,
things will be clearer.

275
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:33,745
So we're living in the age
of fast travelling information.

276
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:37,786
Information..is created at
one source, and goes to the receiver.

277
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,857
That means, for any
information to travel anywhere..

278
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,925
...we need a source and a receiver.

279
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:44,756
Same applies to TV broadcasting.

280
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:48,594
This is the Global Times
Network's source station.

281
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,502
From here, their entire content.

282
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:55,562
...is transmitted to their
satellite through signal package.

283
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:02,642
Now, from the satellite it's
transmitted to the broadcast central.

284
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:06,910
For example 'Sky Dish'..'National
Dish'..etcetera-etcetera..and others.

285
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:10,952
And..again they transmit
it to the satellite.

286
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:14,752
And from here, it's retransmitted
to the dish antenna.

287
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:19,888
Now, the content is decrypted
through our dish antenna..

288
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,521
...and seen on our TV
through the set-top box.

289
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,700
This hacker..hacked our frequency“.

290
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:28,567
...transmitting from
GTN to the satellite.

291
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,338
Once it's hacked,
then the hacker can play God.

292
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:41,441
I mean..he can command
what's goes to the satellite.

293
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,917
...and what does not.

294
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:46,113
So why didn't
your..engineers stop him?

295
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:51,419
Well..this was a very
high-level hacking maneuver.

296
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,358
By the time we could
understand what's happening.

297
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:54,655
...it was already over.

298
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,889
And you let it happen.

299
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:58,658
Well, we tried our best to stop it.

300
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:00,926
But as you know,
we're a huge organization.

301
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,504
And there are protocols to follow.

302
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:04,765
So it took us time to
follow all the procedures.

303
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:07,442
Very interesting.

304
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:10,141
I am sure that even
your cyber-cell will agree..

305
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:11,437
...that we were hacked.

306
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,740
And now, if there's anything
that's not understood.

307
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:15,383
...we'll be happy to answer.

308
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,818
How can we trace a hacker like this?

309
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:26,494
Actually, first of all
we've to think like them.

310
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,127
Don't tell me your
chaps didn't try that.

311
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:31,833
Of course we did,
but the hacker was smart.

312
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:36,598
He used multiple login IDs
to hack the Global Times Network.

313
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:38,934
And the last ID we traced,
was on the US.

314
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:40,007
I knew it.

315
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,003
Meaning?

316
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:45,540
Sometimes you can get hacked
with a simple phone call.

317
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:49,417
And..how is that?

318
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:52,046
Well..the hacker just
needs to hack the medium.

319
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:53,554
And the medium can be anything.

320
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:58,990
For example, video-calls, phone-calls,
radio-signals..and IP address as well.

321
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:00,152
IP address as well.

322
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:02,454
Yes, IP address as well.

323
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:05,467
You can customize your phone
number through the IP address..

324
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:06,901
...and call anyone.

325
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:10,164
And they will never know
who the hacker is, and where.

326
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:11,800
I hope it's clear.

327
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:14,876
And what kind of equipments
do you require for all this?

328
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,043
Simple..

329
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:18,841
High-speed internet..and
a high-end laptop.

330
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:20,649
Sometimes just a phone maybe.

331
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:21,512
WOW!

332
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:23,618
That's it, huh?

333
00:32:24,977 --> 00:32:26,217
And a genius mind.

334
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:28,623
Like you.

335
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:32,222
And a motive too.

336
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,520
Absolutely right.

337
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,693
And we've no motives,
we're the victims.

338
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,798
Right?

339
00:32:38,891 --> 00:32:41,895
Establishing a motive..is my job.

340
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:43,904
And let me do my job, Ms. Siya.

341
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,908
So you can wait for that moment.

342
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:47,940
We would like to leave.

343
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,736
Thank you for your time, gentlemen.

344
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:56,951
What do you think?

345
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,145
No chance.

346
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,552
Actually we don't
have any evidence either.

347
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:04,259
The court won't grant us
even an hour for interrogation.

348
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:05,584
But trust me.

349
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:08,189
I know people like Rahul very well.

350
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,691
If he's done something,
he'll definitely make a mistake.

351
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,197
"Which will be in our favor.

352
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,164
So be it, sir.

353
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:19,975
Sir..Sarnaik sir's phone
records have arrived.

354
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:24,112
If we want to make
some progress in this case..

355
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,983
...we'll have to go
few steps backwards.

356
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,788
Come, Gaitonde..let's listen
to Sarnaik sir's history.

357
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:36,025
'Karan sir, am I disturbing you?'

358
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,616
'It was a big mistake.'

359
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,720
...to think that a cunning
basm like you would be loyal.'

360
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:40,863
Loyal as a dog sir..

361
00:33:40,953 --> 00:33:42,955
Have I ever given
you a chance to complain?'

362
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,122
'You won't anymore.'

363
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,191
I am going to settle
your account once and for all.'

364
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:47,703
'I hope you mean that, sir.'

365
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:49,133
'And you're not furious with me.'

366
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:51,902
<i>Karen Parekh.</i>

367
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,708
Mumbai's real-estate magnet.

368
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,558
Goa's casino king.

369
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:11,694
Collector of Derby horses.

370
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:20,293
Ramesh Sarnaik, ACP Mumbai Police.

371
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:25,902
What cat and mouse
game were they playing?

372
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:30,937
Sir, I think we've
reached the next level.

373
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:35,776
For that, we've to understand
the level of Sarnaik's every case.

374
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,357
Back in the headquarters, you
were trying to be over-smart, Ranvir.

375
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:43,615
Not cool.

376
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:48,355
If someone's paying you a six-digit
salary, doesn't mean he's innocent.

377
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,858
Rahul is a shrewd business.

378
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:53,662
Not a psychopath like that hacker,
whoever he is.

379
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:56,738
And he's honestly admitted
that he's not involved.

380
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:58,766
Honesty..Rahul?

381
00:35:00,032 --> 00:35:01,739
You seriously believe
what Rahul said?

382
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,208
He can stoop to any
level for his business.

383
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:05,637
How can you trust him?

384
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:07,114
So that makes him a murderer.

385
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:09,343
I have a mind too.

386
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,854
And I feel,
rather I am sure that he's innocent.

387
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,252
Only time will tell.

388
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,059
It's a open and shut case, Ranvir.

389
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,626
No logic, no evidence, no proof.

390
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:22,823
And I am telling you this.

391
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:25,361
Siya..

392
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:27,862
...you know..
- What?

393
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,862
When you get angry..

394
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,710
You look really beautiful.

395
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:35,936
You know what.

396
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:38,370
I know.

397
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,413
I think..Rahul Oberoi's
going to be s****

398
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:48,055
And why do you think that?

399
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,093
Because even God can't
win against a furious lover..

400
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,099
...let alone this owner
of Global Network.

401
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:00,859
I see..

402
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,734
Furious love and all.

403
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:08,370
I likes.

404
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:20,975
Rohini..didn't die in a car accident,
she was murdered.

405
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:23,777
Karan got her killed.

406
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:27,218
My child tolerated
that animal for so long.

407
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:31,483
Later when she realized
it was enough..

408
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:33,991
"Then we filed for divorce.

409
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:36,932
We had extensive
evidence against him.

410
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,499
But just one day before
the court's judgment.

411
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:44,167
...Rohini died in a car accident.

412
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,273
No wife, no divorce, no alimony..

413
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,882
No justice, no daughter.

414
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:02,155
Karan wrapped up the
case out of the court.

415
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:05,025
We are..

416
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,354
We're helpless old couple.

417
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:12,426
We're only waiting
for..God's justice.

418
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,369
I can understand your pain.

419
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:22,844
I assure you..justice
can be delayed, but not denied.

420
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:27,539
Right sir, thank you.
- You're welcome.

421
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:30,820
I'll be in touch,
and if anything comes up, I will..

422
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:40,954
Sir..do all your cars get
serviced at Trinity Motors?

423
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:45,591
Do you have service
records of your cars?

424
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:46,999
Yes, I have them.

425
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:48,598
Hurry up, come on.

426
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:55,467
Imagine Gaitonde.

427
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:59,313
...all the cars of a family..

428
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:01,278
"Gets serviced
at the same workshop.

429
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,286
...by the same mechanic,
for all these years.

430
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:08,219
And one of the car
has a brake failure.

431
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:15,059
So..should we hold God responsible
for it, or the mechanic?

432
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:21,327
Sir, I feel..we can
suspect the mechanic.

433
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:22,335
Huh?
- Yes.

434
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:27,899
But sir..where are the
factssupponing your theory?

435
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:33,642
Here you go.
- Thank you.

436
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:45,654
What happened?

437
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:51,023
Sometimes a small piece
of paper..can solve a big case.

438
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,901
Good day, sir. I'll be seeing you.

439
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:54,926
Any luck?

440
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:59,965
I don't know about luck..but
Karan's bad luck is about to begin.

441
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:07,983
Gaitonde, all the service records
have been signed by the same mechanic.

442
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,110
Some Chanderpal.

443
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:14,387
You mean to say the brakes
didn't fail, it was sabotaged.

444
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:17,290
I am not saying it. Chanderpal will.

445
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:18,120
H ow?

446
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,028
We'll request him..to
please cooperate.

447
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:22,997
Come on.
- Sir.

448
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:40,641
Mister.

449
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:44,210
Yes, sir.
- Who is Chanderpal?

450
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,385
Chandu, someone's here to see you.

451
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:47,952
There he is, sir.

452
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:53,993
Yes, sir..what's the job?

453
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,965
We're fans of your talent.

454
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,960
Can you fix..car brakes?

455
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:03,368
Sir, stop Misting words.

456
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,538
Get to the point, what is the job?

457
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:09,110
I like him.
- Me too.

458
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,009
Well..I'll get to the point.

459
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:16,118
Can you sabotage brakes?

460
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,515
Are you police officers?

461
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:28,529
Hey..only two kinds
of people recognize police.

462
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,001
The Police..or criminals.

463
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:33,502
You're not the Police.

464
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:39,040
Look sir..l am a poor mechanic.

465
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:42,374
I don't understand
what you're trying to say.

466
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:46,277
Who told you to sabotage
Sabarwars brakes?

467
00:41:49,441 --> 00:41:50,215
What?

468
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:54,488
Look here, Gaitonde here
is just as good with a stick..

469
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:57,750
...like you are in acting.

470
00:41:57,782 --> 00:41:58,522
Come on.

471
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:01,786
Don't hit me! Don't hit me!

472
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:03,794
I'll tell you, sir..I'll tell you!

473
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:07,468
Let Gaitonde practice some more.

474
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:09,761
It's been really long
since he's had a chance.

475
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:12,172
Sir, I beg you..

476
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:13,373
Let me go.

477
00:42:13,465 --> 00:42:17,777
Karan sir gave me the
money..to sabotage the brakes.

478
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:22,244
How much did he pay you, Chandu?

479
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:24,182
He paid me 70,000.

480
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:27,589
What did you do with
the money, Chandu?

481
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,555
I bought a 40 inch TV, sir.

482
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:33,685
Oh..now taste this
52 inch police truncheon.

483
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:37,392
Sir..don't hit me, sir..don't hit me.

484
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:39,628
I told you everything, sir.
Leave me sir.

485
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:43,569
This punishment is just
for sabotaging the brakes.

486
00:42:44,496 --> 00:42:49,206
You still have to pay for the
death caused by the brake failure.

487
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:51,177
Sir, please..please..

488
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:56,415
If the brakes failed..then how did it
become a accident case in the court?

489
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:58,452
Sarnaik sir had a hand in it, sir.

490
00:42:58,543 --> 00:42:59,681
I see..
- Yes.

491
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:00,713
H ow?

492
00:43:01,346 --> 00:43:03,656
Sir, I am a poor man.

493
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:06,326
I don't know so much in detail.

494
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:10,722
What do you think, Gaitonde?
Does he really not know anything else?

495
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:16,328
You know what,
sir..l don't want to believe him.

496
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:17,235
Okay?'-

497
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:22,704
You can have your fun with him
until you're not completely assured.

498
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,646
And yes..get the paperwork
done and keep him inside.

499
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,547
Or else he'll sabotage
our investigation.

500
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:30,776
Isn't it?

501
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:31,813
No, sir..

502
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:33,349
Sir!

503
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:39,826
I can arrest Karan right now.

504
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,455
He got his wife killed.
Sarnaik covered it up.

505
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:46,235
Later Sarnaik blackmailed
Karan for money.

506
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:47,631
And Karan killed Sarnaik.

507
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:50,261
There's a logical flow in all of it..

508
00:43:50,495 --> 00:43:53,635
"But it all gets
stuck in one place.

509
00:43:53,765 --> 00:43:56,905
...why telecast it live
on Global TV Network?

510
00:43:57,669 --> 00:44:01,139
And how does Rahul
Oberoi fit in all this?

511
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,511
I'll help you.

512
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,378
Huh? What?

513
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:08,690
You know Karan and
Rahul were partners.

514
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:11,917
In fact, Karan had a
stake in Global Times Network.

515
00:44:12,717 --> 00:44:16,358
But these two had a major
fallout regarding money.

516
00:44:16,421 --> 00:44:18,765
They in fact had a big
spat in the board meeting.

517
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:22,201
Rahul sc**** Karan out
of approximately 10 billion.

518
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,361
Then what?

519
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:29,205
Karan was so furious,
that he openly claimed to ruin Rahul.

520
00:44:29,234 --> 00:44:32,238
Are you serious?
How do you know that?

521
00:44:32,604 --> 00:44:33,810
Even I have my sources.

522
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:35,179
Inside-trading.

523
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,383
Revenge was the motive.

524
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:41,213
He got two birds with one stone.
Fantastic.

525
00:44:41,246 --> 00:44:44,250
With Sarnaik dead, there's
no evidence to Rohini murder case.

526
00:44:44,716 --> 00:44:49,222
And live murder on TV
means..Rahul Oberoi is finished.

527
00:44:50,622 --> 00:44:51,828
Where are your feet, sir?

528
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:53,800
No-no..right now,
you must trouble your feet.

529
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:55,232
And take a statement from Rahul..

530
00:44:55,393 --> 00:44:57,236
...stating that Karan
threatened to kill him.

531
00:44:57,362 --> 00:44:59,239
I am sure Rahul will
be happy to give it to you.

532
00:45:02,567 --> 00:45:05,673
Come on..run before Karan runs away.

533
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:18,658
Siya..do you have any
family details of Sarnaik?

534
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:19,726
Why?

535
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:22,356
I wanted to send some
flowers and a thank you card.

536
00:45:23,288 --> 00:45:29,705
You know..while dying,
a stranger..made our channel no. 1

537
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,003
It's funny.

538
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,535
There's success hidden
behind my ruination.

539
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:36,640
I am having a dream run.

540
00:45:36,768 --> 00:45:38,907
You're such a sick man, Rahul.

541
00:45:39,804 --> 00:45:41,306
Then why don't you cure me?

542
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:45,446
Believe me,
Siya..only your love can cure me.

543
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,284
In your dreams.

544
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,030
Yeah.

545
00:45:56,721 --> 00:46:00,498
Sir, ACP Kabir Deshmukh from
Mumbai Police is here to see you.

546
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,661
Shall I send him in.

547
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,871
Send him.
- Okay, sir.

548
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:09,909
Kabir?
- Yeah.

549
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:11,502
Relax, Rahul.

550
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:15,443
Hello.

551
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:24,789
Sir, why do you make
faces when you see me?

552
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:28,964
The police don't always
come with an arrest warrant.

553
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:29,855
Right?

554
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,324
This time I have good news.

555
00:46:32,724 --> 00:46:35,034
Sorry..breaking news.

556
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:36,828
What do you mean?

557
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:37,965
<i>Karen.</i>

558
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:41,475
<i>Karen Parekh.</i>

559
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:44,075
Your best friend.

560
00:46:47,038 --> 00:46:47,982
That rascal.

561
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:50,444
What rascal, Mr. Rahul.

562
00:46:50,842 --> 00:46:52,480
He just made your ratings soar.

563
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,685
He's been a true friend.

564
00:46:56,347 --> 00:47:00,022
He did break a few laws in
the process, but we'll handle those.

565
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:02,762
You just sign this statement..

566
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:06,399
And later you can play
'Breaking-news' all you like.

567
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:10,566
Can I see this statement?
- Of course, yeah.

568
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:22,039
What is all this, Rahul?

569
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,411
Sir, you can sign this later.

570
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:25,954
You can explain this to him later"

571
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:27,818
...and you can understand
this from her later.

572
00:47:27,879 --> 00:47:28,857
I have to go.

573
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:30,392
I'll send someone
for the signed copies.

574
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,630
Sir..you can brighten
up your mood now.

575
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:01,717
Karan's arrest warrant.
What you wanted.

576
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:02,551
Thank you, sir.

577
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:09,958
"Heart's filled with pain,
that I want to cry."

578
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:15,163
"Without you...my hear-t
wants to just fade away."

579
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:30,410
"I loved you...more than God."

580
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:35,683
"I loved you...more than God."

581
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:40,586
"Yet I couldn't make you mine."

582
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:46,529
"Always dwelled in your heart..."

583
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:51,005
"...but couldn't
reach your heartbeats."

584
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:57,802
"So close...yet
we were so apart."

585
00:48:57,869 --> 00:49:04,445
"Who can listen my
heartbreaking apan?"

586
00:49:05,576 --> 00:49:10,582
"Sweetheart...love's true."

587
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:15,929
"Destiny's craves
for something else."

588
00:49:16,554 --> 00:49:21,162
"Struck by destiny,
what can we do?"

589
00:49:21,893 --> 00:49:26,672
"Struck by destiny,
what can we do?"

590
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:32,513
"Struck by destiny,
what can we do?"

591
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:37,216
"Destiny cannot be controlled."

592
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:40,020
"Sweetheart. <i>. </i>

593
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:42,614

"Sweetheart. . Sweetheart. <i>. </i>

595
00:49:59,964 --> 00:50:02,001
"It's the grace of time..."

596
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:10,075
"...that you're sitting
so close to me."

597
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:20,526
"It's hard to explain in
words...how much I love you."

598
00:50:20,952 --> 00:50:25,901
"Look at me...just once."

599
00:50:25,957 --> 00:50:31,737
"Who can listen my
heartbreaking apan?"

00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:39,775

612
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,148
Does sir know you're coming?

613
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:24,252
No ma'am,
we're here to give him a surprise.

614
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:27,346
Sir is in room no. 1211.

615
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:28,418
Thank you.

616
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:33,693
Gaitonde.
- Sir.

617
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:34,695
Staircase.
- Okay, sir.

618
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,721
Let's go.
- Quick.

619
00:53:30,341 --> 00:53:31,342
1211?

620
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:03,941
Where is Karan?
- You guys...

621
00:54:04,008 --> 00:54:05,112
Where is Karan?

622
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,017
But he just got up to open the door.

623
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:07,885
What?

624
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:09,355
How long ago?

625
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,323
Just 5 minutes before you arrived.

626
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:16,897
'1211...'

627
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:24,062
House-keeping service
at this late hour?

628
00:54:24,161 --> 00:54:25,162
Gaitonde.

629
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:37,341
Seal all the
entry/exits of the hotel.

630
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:40,182
Check every floor,
search every corner of the hotel.

631
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,847
Karan shouldn't get out of here.

632
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:43,357
Exits block.

633
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:54,901
What's wrong, sir? What is it?

634
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:55,801
What happened?

635
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:04,911
Yes, Avinash?
- Sir, Karan's live on GTN.

636
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:06,170
What?
- Yes, sir.

637
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:10,509
May I have the remote please?
- Yes sir.

638
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,879
Rahul, are you watching?

639
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:41,276
Yes.

640
00:55:42,907 --> 00:55:43,885
I am coming.

641
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:27,995
Keep trying-

642
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:39,666
Sir...

643
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:50,080
Got it.

644
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:58,057
Yes, Avinash?

645
00:56:58,182 --> 00:57:00,093
Sir, we've traced the
location to an IP address.

646
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:02,494
Where? - There's a chawl just
ten minutes from where you are...

647
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,565
...Shanti Niwas,
Purshottam Narvekar Road.

648
00:57:04,655 --> 00:57:07,033
He's not very far away.
- Let's go guys.

649
00:58:38,415 --> 00:58:39,257
Yes, Avinash.

650
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,124
Sir, the location has shift.

651
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:44,360
I think he's jumping the IP address.

652
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,464
We've lost him.

653
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:24,069
Sir, give me a team...in
the middle of the night...'

654
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:25,606
'Give me this...give me that...'

655
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:26,730
And what was the result?

656
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:30,210
Do you know...Human Rights,
Media, the common man...

657
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,243
The entire world is laughing on us.

658
00:59:33,103 --> 00:59:36,107
When you go out there,
people will laugh at Mumbai Police.

659
00:59:38,142 --> 00:59:40,622
Two live murders were
telecasted on TV back-to-back.

660
00:59:41,345 --> 00:59:44,155
The one you called the
murderer...gets murdered.

661
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:47,252
And you gave a clean
chit to the one suspected.

662
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:49,695
Go and arrest that
Rahul Oberoi first.

663
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:51,595
And make him spill the truth.

664
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:53,496
Sir, I don't think that Rahul...

665
00:59:53,557 --> 00:59:57,095
You can see the result of
your opinion...outside the window.

666
00:59:57,528 --> 00:59:59,132
Now do as I say.

667
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:02,572
Grill the one we suspect first.

668
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:03,369
Yes, sir.

669
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,277
Jai Hind, sir.

670
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:10,114
Mumbai police...
- Down! Down!

671
01:00:10,207 --> 01:00:13,552
Mumbai police...
- Down! Down!

672
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:16,350
Sir, let's arrest Rahul.

673
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,251
The Commissioner is right.

674
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:21,261
Why will Rahul make
the same mistake twice?

675
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:25,723
Mumbai police...
- Down! Down!

676
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:27,698
The murderer is someone else.

677
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,496
Who, why and where...

678
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:34,698
Mumbai police...
- Down! Down!

679
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:38,642
And finding him is the
real pride of this uniform.

680
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,312
Otherwise...uniforms
can be rented too.

681
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:28,789
Rahul Oberoi.

682
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:32,358
CEO and Chairman
of Global Times Network.

683
01:01:32,556 --> 01:01:36,231
He's under the
debt of 4.65 billion.

684
01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:38,763
His main business is news.

685
01:01:39,229 --> 01:01:41,266
And he's got only
one medium of income.

686
01:01:41,598 --> 01:01:43,236
Sensationalizing of news.

687
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:47,213
And..in order to repay
the debt of 4.65 million..

688
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:48,848
...one needed a big explosion.

689
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,914
More ratings.
More advertisers, more money.

690
01:01:53,243 --> 01:01:53,778
Simple.

691
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:57,815
Your honor, first murder;
ACP Sarnaik.

692
01:01:58,482 --> 01:02:01,986
And Rahul knew that ACP
Sarnaik was blackmailing Karan..

693
01:02:02,252 --> 01:02:03,697
...for cover up his wife's murder.

694
01:02:05,756 --> 01:02:08,259
ACP killed on live TV..the
suspicion goes on Karan..

695
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:10,805
...and ratings to Global
Times Network..excellent.

696
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,739
The second murder
of Karan himself.

697
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:18,705
Reason..a strong and
bold criminal psychology.

698
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:24,010
Rahul Oberoi is a hardcore
criminal, a cunning murderer..

699
01:02:24,274 --> 01:02:25,981
...and a big threat to the society.

700
01:02:34,785 --> 01:02:36,822
Theory-theory and more theory.

701
01:02:37,821 --> 01:02:39,596
Whatever the defense
council just said..

702
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:42,327
...is all based
on some imagination.

703
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,402
Like..a writer's fantasy.

704
01:02:47,831 --> 01:02:52,280
Is there any evidence, any proof..or
any eye-witness to this approach?

705
01:02:52,636 --> 01:02:55,480
Baseless. logic-less. abstract.

706
01:02:57,407 --> 01:02:59,978
My client Rahul Oberoi
completely cooperated..

707
01:03:00,043 --> 01:03:02,956
...with the Mumbai Police
officer in every investigation.

708
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:05,620
But now..we will not cooperate.

709
01:03:07,684 --> 01:03:09,925
Now,
the law will cooperate with us.

710
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,829
Your honor,
it's a complicated case.

711
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:13,332
This is not a
chain-snatching case.

712
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,892
"Which can be solved
in a single day.

713
01:03:15,058 --> 01:03:18,039
It takes time to gather evidence,
Ms. Siya.

714
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:20,297
One of your own officer's
has been murdered.

715
01:03:20,564 --> 01:03:21,941
And you say you need more time.

716
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:24,970
Every kid in the country is watching
this horrific death on television.

717
01:03:25,035 --> 01:03:26,673
And you say you need more time.

718
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:29,907
An honest, tax-paying citizen
has been called murderer, psycho.

719
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:32,351
...and in no time he's
been summoned to the court.

720
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,383
You can't catch the murderer.

721
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:36,990
And just going around in
circles..to hide your failure.

722
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:40,893
Our cyber-cell team is working.
- Your cyber cell was clueless.

723
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:43,725
It was we who told them..that
our systems were hacked.

724
01:03:43,887 --> 01:03:45,924
And why will
Rahul Oberoi help you.

725
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:48,833
To incriminate himself?
- No, to clear the suspicion on him, Ms. Siya.

726
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:49,835
Do you have proof?

727
01:03:49,893 --> 01:03:52,601
That's why we want judicial
custody of Rahul Oberoi.

728
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,448
This is not some
chain-snatching case.

729
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:08,385
...where you can arrest
anyone you suspect.

730
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:10,957
The Mumbai Police should
do their homework properly.

731
01:04:11,114 --> 01:04:13,116
Is Rahul Oberoi
thier only suspect?

732
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:16,829
They can't prove him murderer
by calling him 'Murderer'.

733
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:19,092
Give me a proof..give
me an evidence.

734
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:20,960
...and you can definitely
take Rahul in custody.

735
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:22,564
But that will never happen.

736
01:04:22,826 --> 01:04:27,002
Because your entire department.
cannot find a single murderer.

737
01:04:27,097 --> 01:04:28,974
He's always a step ahead of you.

738
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:31,568
And you just want
to cover-up your failure.

739
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:36,848
Your honor,
my client deserves his lawful freedom.

740
01:04:50,754 --> 01:04:55,430
The Mumbai Police hasn't presented
any evidence against Rahul Oberoi.

741
01:04:56,626 --> 01:05:01,006
Nor could they prove
any motive of his involvement.

742
01:05:01,131 --> 01:05:06,080
So permission for judicial
custody..is refused.

743
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:24,063
Suhani, put this piece here.
- No-no..

744
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:28,926
Poppy..come quickly,
I need your help.

745
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:29,901
WOW!

746
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,502
That's a big puzzle.

747
01:05:34,498 --> 01:05:35,738
It's so confusing.

748
01:05:35,866 --> 01:05:38,176
You're an expert
in solving puzzles.

749
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:40,608
Which piece will fit here?

750
01:05:40,871 --> 01:05:41,679
You tell me.

751
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:42,916
I don't know.

752
01:05:43,206 --> 01:05:44,879
Focus, dear. Focus.

753
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:50,558
Sometimes the piece is right
before us..but we don't see it.

754
01:05:52,716 --> 01:05:54,127
Got it.
- Yeah.

755
01:05:54,184 --> 01:05:56,528
Thank you, poppy. You're a genius.

756
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:01,126
Let's play together.

757
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:06,596
Sometimes the piece is right
before us..but we don't see it.'

758
01:06:08,865 --> 01:06:11,072
We know the connection
between Karan and Sarnaik.

759
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:14,148
And the connection
between Rahul and Karan.

760
01:06:15,205 --> 01:06:20,814
But what connects Karan,
Rahul and Sarnaik.

761
01:06:22,913 --> 01:06:23,948
Three dots.

762
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:26,150
...how can you connect them?

763
01:06:33,223 --> 01:06:34,861
Gaitonde.
- Yes, sir.

764
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:36,262
I want a information.

765
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:46,102
Hi, baby.

766
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:47,712
What's the matter?

767
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,646
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

768
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:52,177
Coffee? Breakfast?
What would you like?

769
01:06:54,978 --> 01:06:58,084
You're defending this case
with your eyes and ears closed, Siya.

770
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:02,019
Why don't you understand..that Rahul's
involved in this case. he is involved.

771
01:07:06,923 --> 01:07:08,231
Don't you dare shout on me!

772
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:09,895
I am not shouting.

773
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:14,307
I am just trying to tell you,
rather explain you..

774
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:16,237
...that you're making
a big mistake, Siya.

775
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:22,581
What kind of a job is this
which compels you to help a murderer?

776
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,083
I know such people really well.

777
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:26,950
These people
have no fear of the law.

778
01:07:27,077 --> 01:07:28,886
They can do anything they
want on the basis of money and power.

779
01:07:28,945 --> 01:07:30,549
And they get someone
like you to save them.

780
01:07:30,981 --> 01:07:32,790
What do you mean 'Like you'?

781
01:07:32,983 --> 01:07:34,929
I genuinely feel
Rahul is innocent.

782
01:07:34,985 --> 01:07:36,896
And I'm trying
my best to defend him.

783
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,829
That's what the law thinks too.

784
01:07:38,922 --> 01:07:41,163
Ranveer, give your mind some rest.

785
01:07:41,324 --> 01:07:43,201
You're going around in circles.

786
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:44,863
I am going around in circles?

787
01:07:45,662 --> 01:07:47,664
Fine.. Then tell me,
weren't Rahul and Karan best friends?

788
01:07:47,964 --> 01:07:49,841
Rahul owed 12.2
billion to Karan.

789
01:07:49,933 --> 01:07:50,968
12.2 billion.

790
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,107
And that Sarnaik.

791
01:07:54,671 --> 01:07:55,979
Why was he murdered?

792
01:07:56,773 --> 01:07:58,309
Don't you think they
are all connected together?

793
01:07:58,575 --> 01:07:59,576
Ranveer, you're hurting me.

794
01:07:59,776 --> 01:08:01,983
And the thought of this
killer lose is killing me.

795
01:08:03,213 --> 01:08:04,658
Rahul is innocent.

796
01:08:09,319 --> 01:08:10,161
Kabir?

797
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:14,166
I have proof.
- What proof?

798
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:17,798
<i>Rem rape case.</i>

799
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,738
Rajni rape case is the only case.

800
01:08:24,868 --> 01:08:27,280
...that links Rahul,
Karan and Sarnaik together.

801
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,640
What is Rajni rape case?

802
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:32,017
This case is the
pan of this puzzle..

803
01:08:32,075 --> 01:08:34,646
"Which no one bothered to see!

804
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:37,825
Ranveer, what's this case?

805
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:39,053
Who is Rajni?

806
01:08:46,089 --> 01:08:46,965
My first client.

807
01:08:47,357 --> 01:08:49,803
Global Times Network's
employee of the year.

808
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:53,298
She was raped by Rahul and Karan.
- What?

809
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:01,274
Leave me..

810
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:02,406
Leave me..

811
01:09:02,706 --> 01:09:06,779
Please let me go, sir.
Please let me go..

812
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:08,878
Let me go, sir.

813
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:16,352
Sir, please..
- Come on.

814
01:09:16,386 --> 01:09:19,367
Sir, please..Rahul sir, let me go.

815
01:09:19,422 --> 01:09:21,095
Sir please..

816
01:09:23,393 --> 01:09:27,170
Sir, sorry..please. Let me go.

817
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:28,264
Sorry, sir.

818
01:09:29,132 --> 01:09:30,907
I really don't get you girls?

819
01:09:31,134 --> 01:09:32,772
You can sleep with your boyfriend.

820
01:09:33,703 --> 01:09:34,704
It's casual.

821
01:09:35,805 --> 01:09:39,685
But, if someone like
us genuinely asks for it..

822
01:09:40,076 --> 01:09:41,180
"Then you get offended.

823
01:09:41,811 --> 01:09:42,812
You slapped me..

824
01:09:43,246 --> 01:09:44,224
Sinplease, sir.

825
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:51,799
Let me go.. please.

826
01:09:51,888 --> 01:09:55,768
After getting slapped..my mercy has died.
- Please..

827
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:56,966
Please..

828
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:00,399
Karan sir, please..
- Look-look..

829
01:10:01,464 --> 01:10:02,169
No..

830
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:06,177
Either you make love
to us..one-by-one.

831
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:09,243
Or you really make
it tough for yourself.

832
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:11,477
Please sir, I have a boyfriend.

833
01:10:11,741 --> 01:10:13,778
I am getting married, sir..please.

834
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:16,014
That's like a good girl, baby.

835
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:18,414
Well..now we'll make
a small mistake as well.

836
01:10:18,448 --> 01:10:19,324
No..

837
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:22,896
Then you can forgive us too.
- No-no-no..

838
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:43,439
Who's in there?

839
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:46,376
Open the shutter.

840
01:10:48,178 --> 01:10:49,179
Who's in there?

841
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:52,449
Open LIP--

842
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,400
Hey..who's there?

843
01:10:59,489 --> 01:11:02,197
Let that poor girl go.
You won't, huh!

844
01:11:02,525 --> 01:11:04,163
I'll go get the police.

845
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:09,365
Hurry up bro,
this is my second cigarette.

846
01:11:12,535 --> 01:11:13,536
All yours, bro.

847
01:11:17,307 --> 01:11:18,251
Come on, baby..

848
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:26,859
Sir please, come quickly.

849
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:28,859
Some girl is being
raped in the garage.

850
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:30,522
Who is getting raped?

851
01:11:31,187 --> 01:11:33,929
This is not the time for question
and answers. Come with me now.

852
01:11:34,057 --> 01:11:35,866
Two men are raping a girl.

853
01:11:35,925 --> 01:11:37,802
So you should've helped her.

854
01:11:38,361 --> 01:11:39,465
Why did you come running here?

855
01:11:39,529 --> 01:11:41,338
You should've beaten
up those rascals.

856
01:11:41,998 --> 01:11:43,238
You think this is a joke.

857
01:11:43,433 --> 01:11:44,844
That poor girl is in trouble.

858
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:46,174
And you're wasting time.

859
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,145
Get up! I said get up.

860
01:11:57,247 --> 01:11:58,590
Come..come, inspector.

861
01:11:58,915 --> 01:12:00,417
They were raping her here.

862
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:02,224
There was a car parked here.
I don't know where it is now.

863
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,160
Maybe it's too late.

864
01:12:03,219 --> 01:12:05,199
I saw it with my own eyes.
- Who's getting raped?

865
01:12:05,255 --> 01:12:06,256
Where is the rapist?
- Here..

866
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,403
Oh no..

867
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,880
Don't just stand there.
Call the ambulance.

868
01:12:19,936 --> 01:12:21,438
We must take her to the hospital.

869
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:22,505
Go on!

870
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:36,123
The wound on your body will heal.

871
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:40,330
But,
I won't rest peacefully until..

872
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:42,959
...I don't make them pay
for hurting your self-esteem.

873
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:51,044
Madam, would you
like to talk now, or..

874
01:12:51,601 --> 01:12:53,638
'Rajni told police everything.'

875
01:12:55,071 --> 01:12:56,880
'Mr. Sharma was with her too.'

876
01:12:57,106 --> 01:13:00,212
She star-ted preparing
to drag powerful people..

877
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:02,217
...like Rahul and
Karan to the court.'

878
01:13:03,613 --> 01:13:05,388
But I want to tell you..

879
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:10,554
This is going to be a long,
painful, tiring and humiliating case.

880
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:12,422
Think about it.

881
01:13:13,623 --> 01:13:16,126
When a rape case is
discussed in the court.

882
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:18,538
...it's not less than
a rape case itself.

883
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:21,068
Doesn't make a difference to me.

884
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:24,601
I want justice.

885
01:13:25,969 --> 01:13:29,439
Rather..l want my revenge.

886
01:13:42,318 --> 01:13:44,958
Karan sir, am I disturbing you.

887
01:13:45,355 --> 01:13:46,026
Go on.

888
01:13:46,289 --> 01:13:48,496
You should've broken the
toy after playing with it ,

889
01:13:48,658 --> 01:13:49,636
But you spared it.

890
01:13:49,692 --> 01:13:52,298
And now..the case has been filed.

891
01:13:52,562 --> 01:13:53,563
And they have a lawyer too.

892
01:13:54,564 --> 01:13:55,702
They've a strong witness

893
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,406
So..what to do?

894
01:14:02,071 --> 01:14:04,950
What else..buy out the lawyer.

895
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:09,454
Sir, not everyone
is cooperative like me.

896
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,982
But Still..l will try.

897
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:27,163
Call up your Karan sir.
- Of course, sir.

898
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:31,645
Just a second.
- Yes.

899
01:14:35,605 --> 01:14:37,642
Sir..I've handed over the package.

900
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:38,611
He likes it.

901
01:14:39,409 --> 01:14:42,117
Yes, he wants to talk to you.
Wants to say thank you.

902
01:14:43,613 --> 01:14:44,614
Here you go, sir.

903
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:53,190
Did you hear..my thank you?

904
01:14:53,389 --> 01:14:55,062
Your ideals.

905
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,630
...your principles.

906
01:14:59,128 --> 01:15:03,076
It's alright, Mr.
Lawyer..see you at the coun.

907
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:07,637
Your honor, unfortunately
the punishment for gang-rape..

908
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,650
...in our law is only 10 years.

909
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:11,719
You must take a
decision which will ..

910
01:15:11,774 --> 01:15:13,651
...eradicate the mentality
of people like Karan and Rahul.

911
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,752
To put the last nail in the coffin
of these two, Karan and Rahul..

912
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:21,689
...I would like to call the
only eye-witness of this case.

913
01:15:22,652 --> 01:15:24,154
Mr. Bijendra Sharma.

914
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:25,493
Permission granted.

915
01:15:38,768 --> 01:15:42,079
Sir,
we've have some very bad news.

916
01:15:43,773 --> 01:15:47,653
Last night a fire broke out in Mr.
Sharma's house.

917
01:15:49,245 --> 01:15:50,246
...and he burnt to death.

918
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:04,570
Burnt to death? So simple?

919
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:06,764
Mr. Sharma was burnt to death!

920
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:09,173
There was a short circuit,
fire broke out, and..

921
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:10,806
Finished.

922
01:16:11,601 --> 01:16:13,103
And then what?

923
01:16:13,536 --> 01:16:14,537
They were acquited.

924
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:16,648
I lost my first case.

925
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:25,789
And.. Rajni?

926
01:16:29,185 --> 01:16:31,825
I don't know where she
disappeared to after that.

927
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:36,570
Karan and Rahul raped
my capability in the court.

928
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:39,499
They turned a rape
case into consensual sex.

929
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:41,808
After that I heard that..

930
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,135
Rajni left the city.

931
01:16:46,536 --> 01:16:50,848
But no clue about where she went.

932
01:16:53,843 --> 01:16:55,322
But she's back now..

933
01:16:56,846 --> 01:16:58,257
...and what a comeback.

934
01:16:59,682 --> 01:17:03,255
No judge or lawyer,
no evidence or witness.

935
01:17:04,487 --> 01:17:05,864
She is giving her own judgment.

936
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:11,864
Let Rahul die if has to.

937
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:17,675
It will only mean one
less animal on this earth.

938
01:17:31,781 --> 01:17:33,385
We must save Rahul.

939
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:45,300
Sir.

940
01:17:45,728 --> 01:17:49,733
I want every detail of Rajni
rape case..as soon as possible.

941
01:17:49,799 --> 01:17:51,176
As you wish, sir.

942
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,377
Bloody..

943
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:06,971
"The reason..l feel
overwhelmed every season.."

944
01:20:07,036 --> 01:20:09,949
"The reason is you."

945
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,787
"The reason is you."

946
01:20:15,378 --> 01:20:21,090
"The reason..I've
become so poetic.."

947
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:23,557
"The reason is you."

948
01:20:24,787 --> 01:20:27,996
"The reason is you."

949
01:20:29,058 --> 01:20:35,065
"I was shattered in pieces..but
I feel complete now.."

950
01:20:36,065 --> 01:20:41,014
"I strolled down
your lane every day."

951
01:20:42,071 --> 01:20:44,449
"The reason is you."

952
01:20:45,508 --> 01:20:48,114
"The reason is you."

953
01:20:49,078 --> 01:20:52,491
"The reason is you."

954
01:20:52,548 --> 01:20:55,893
"The reason is you."

955
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:42,104
"I was never
like I am these days."

956
01:21:42,164 --> 01:21:48,979
"I was never
like I am these days."

957
01:21:49,071 --> 01:21:55,545
"I hardly meet anyone
else..except for you."

958
01:21:56,011 --> 01:22:02,792
"I hardly meet anyone
else..except for you."

959
01:22:03,018 --> 01:22:09,025
"I've star-ted
changing these days."

960
01:22:09,091 --> 01:22:11,469
"The reason is you."

961
01:22:12,528 --> 01:22:14,804
"The reason is you."

962
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:19,501
"The reason is you."

963
01:22:19,568 --> 01:22:22,549
"The reason is you."

964
01:22:37,987 --> 01:22:44,233
"Whenever I look for you,
I find you inside me."

965
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:51,470
"Whenever I look for you,
I find you inside me."

966
01:22:51,734 --> 01:22:53,941
"Where do you begin..."

967
01:22:54,036 --> 01:22:58,485
"...and where do I end,
it's hard to say."

968
01:22:58,741 --> 01:23:00,948
"Where do you begin..."

969
01:23:01,043 --> 01:23:05,492
"...and where do I end,
it's hard to say."

970
01:23:05,915 --> 01:23:11,729
"I am deeply, madly in love."

971
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,494
"The reason is you."

972
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:18,003
"The reason is you."

973
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:23,105
"I was like shattered
in a million pieces."

974
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:25,838
"But I feel whole again."

975
01:23:26,635 --> 01:23:32,642
"As I pass down your lane every day."

976
01:23:32,775 --> 01:23:34,755
"The reason is you."

977
01:23:35,978 --> 01:23:38,049
"The reason is you."

978
01:23:39,582 --> 01:23:42,927
"The reason is you."

979
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:45,794
"The reason is you."

980
01:23:50,593 --> 01:23:54,598
You know poppy,
I finished my homework on time.

981
01:23:54,697 --> 01:23:55,937
Good girl.

982
01:23:58,867 --> 01:23:59,743
Hello.

983
01:24:00,002 --> 01:24:01,037
How are you, Kabir?

984
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:04,717
I am fine, and you are?
- I am not fine, Kabir.

985
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:08,078
Because you're not letting
me do my job. - Who's this?

986
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:11,191
You're a good Police officer,
and I respect you for that.

987
01:24:11,246 --> 01:24:14,227
But I request you..please
back out this 'live-murder' case.

988
01:24:14,283 --> 01:24:15,557
It's not worth it.

989
01:24:15,584 --> 01:24:17,723
Rahul has to die,
and you can't stop it.

990
01:24:18,921 --> 01:24:22,994
Confidence is a good thing,
but over confidence is bad.

991
01:24:23,125 --> 01:24:26,072
Please, I've no interest
in harming you in anyway, Kabir.

992
01:24:26,595 --> 01:24:28,233
Because you have
a beautiful daughter.

993
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:30,674
...and you have to live for her.

994
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:34,340
Listen, you sound like
you're an educated guy.

995
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:36,749
But you're threatening
me like cheap.

996
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:41,714
Kabir..I've done my
duty of warning you.

997
01:24:42,311 --> 01:24:44,313
Now you must do your
duty as a good father.

998
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,286
Stay away from this case.

999
01:24:54,223 --> 01:24:56,328
You can customize
your phone number..'

1000
01:24:56,625 --> 01:24:58,605
...through the IP
address and call anyone.'

1001
01:24:58,627 --> 01:25:01,608
And they won't even know
who the hacker is, and where.'

1002
01:25:26,722 --> 01:25:27,632
Yes?

1003
01:25:27,723 --> 01:25:29,293
Makrand Moghe.

1004
01:25:29,892 --> 01:25:31,200
He's not at home right now?

1005
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:32,304
Who are you?

1006
01:25:32,895 --> 01:25:33,896
Kabir Deshmukh.

1007
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:36,632
Mumbai Police.

1008
01:25:37,066 --> 01:25:37,908
When will he be back?

1009
01:25:38,167 --> 01:25:39,339
He'll be back soon.

1010
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:43,216
Can I wait for him inside?

1011
01:25:44,673 --> 01:25:46,050
Okay, come in.

1012
01:25:49,078 --> 01:25:50,318
Here.
- Thank you.

1013
01:27:20,803 --> 01:27:23,147
The wheels of time stopped
spinning for me long ago.

1014
01:27:28,277 --> 01:27:34,125
But the tracks of my wheelchair
finally led you to me.

1015
01:27:37,352 --> 01:27:38,296
<i>Rem .</i>

1016
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:44,399
Puzzle solved.

1017
01:27:46,895 --> 01:27:51,173
Mak's home..and photos of Rahul,
Karan and Sarnaik.

1018
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,809
And the guest at home is Rajni.

1019
01:27:54,469 --> 01:27:57,541
One can let a guest
like this in his home..

1020
01:27:57,973 --> 01:27:59,975
...when she already
dwells in his heart.

1021
01:28:03,912 --> 01:28:07,826
Mak is the boyfriend
Rajni wanted to marry.

1022
01:28:12,487 --> 01:28:14,558
Revenge, you have many faces.

1023
01:28:22,164 --> 01:28:24,269
For the first time
in my entire career..

1024
01:28:24,533 --> 01:28:26,513
...my hear-t and mind
are in disagreement.

1025
01:28:29,004 --> 01:28:32,110
If I listen to my heart, then
I should let you go as the victim.

1026
01:28:34,176 --> 01:28:37,953
If I listen to my mind,
I should arrest you as the culprit.

1027
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:44,029
What should I do?

1028
01:28:56,531 --> 01:28:57,532
Gaitonde. - Yes sir.

1029
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:00,444
Send the fingerprints and
all the documents connected..

1030
01:29:00,569 --> 01:29:02,014
...to this case to forensics.

1031
01:29:02,271 --> 01:29:04,273
Rajni will stay under
house-arrest for the time being.

1032
01:29:04,439 --> 01:29:07,852
Gaitonder, I want these
repor-ts..as soon as possible.

1033
01:29:07,876 --> 01:29:08,445
Okay sir.

1034
01:29:08,577 --> 01:29:10,352
We must trace Mak.

1035
01:29:10,579 --> 01:29:12,217
We cannot let Mak
slip out of our hands.

1036
01:29:12,881 --> 01:29:14,952
And in the mean time,
keep a watch on Rajni. Okay?

1037
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:15,585
Right.

1038
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:24,531
The case has been solved.

1039
01:29:25,127 --> 01:29:29,132
Makrand Moghe,
also known as Mak is the accused.

1040
01:29:29,298 --> 01:29:32,643
Mak, who is also the technical
head of Global Times Network.

1041
01:29:32,901 --> 01:29:33,971
...planned these murders.

1042
01:29:34,069 --> 01:29:36,379
But why did Makrand
Moghe do such a thing?

1043
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:37,447
Revenge.

1044
01:29:38,106 --> 01:29:42,577
And the motive for revenge
is linked to a 5 year old case.

1045
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:45,455
Since the matter will
now go to the court.

1046
01:29:45,514 --> 01:29:47,619
...we cannot disclose
any more information.

1047
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:50,129
Thank you everyone for your time.

1048
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:51,125
Sir..

1049
01:29:51,586 --> 01:29:53,930
"As you saw, ACP Ramesh Sarnaik and
Karan Parek murder case has been solved."

1050
01:29:53,989 --> 01:29:55,024
Unbelievable.

1051
01:29:56,925 --> 01:30:00,429
Mak..Rajni's boyfriend.

1052
01:30:01,663 --> 01:30:03,233
ACP Kabir Deshmukh.

1053
01:30:03,632 --> 01:30:08,411
A humble servant of India's strongest.
and most effective Police Force.

1054
01:30:09,604 --> 01:30:10,446
Mumbai Police.

1055
01:30:12,474 --> 01:30:14,476
Isn't the Mumbai Police
a little helpless?

1056
01:30:15,043 --> 01:30:16,420
Catch him and explain him.

1057
01:30:16,545 --> 01:30:18,149
“That I didn't
rape his girlfriend.

1058
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:19,418
I was acquitted.

1059
01:30:19,648 --> 01:30:21,321
He's a f**** psycho, God dammit.

1060
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:23,552
What a rascal..striking
from the shadows?

1061
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:25,997
What's the guarantee
of my safety, Kabir?

1062
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:31,159
When are you going
to arrest that rascal, Mak?

1063
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:33,030
Soon.

1064
01:30:33,695 --> 01:30:35,003
And you don't worry.

1065
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:37,439
Your safety is our priority.

1066
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:39,108
Priority?

1067
01:30:39,668 --> 01:30:40,510
My safety?

1068
01:30:41,636 --> 01:30:44,276
Your priority
should be arrest Mak.

1069
01:30:44,673 --> 01:30:46,209
That Will
automatically make me safe.

1070
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:49,183
You better do your job Kabir.

1071
01:30:54,983 --> 01:30:56,121
Manisha. - Yes, sir.

1072
01:30:56,218 --> 01:30:57,060
Please come in.

1073
01:31:02,657 --> 01:31:04,659
Manisha,
collect my passport from him.

1074
01:31:04,693 --> 01:31:06,263
And book me on the
first flight to New York.

1075
01:31:06,428 --> 01:31:07,202
Sure, sir.

1076
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:08,638
And pack my insulin
shots also. - Okay.

1077
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:09,504
Thank you.

1078
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:14,007
And Kabir, make sure you get
me to the airport safe and sound.

1079
01:31:14,069 --> 01:31:15,412
I'll talk to your Commissioner.

1080
01:31:16,004 --> 01:31:17,312
You do have my number.

1081
01:31:17,572 --> 01:31:20,212
Whatsapp me when you get Mak.

1082
01:31:22,577 --> 01:31:23,555
And listen.

1083
01:31:25,113 --> 01:31:26,490
Don't forward me any cheap jokes.

1084
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:55,215
Oh..

1085
01:31:56,778 --> 01:31:59,691
Siya! Siya! Siya!

1086
01:32:04,219 --> 01:32:07,257
I didn't know that
I was helping a rapist.

1087
01:32:07,456 --> 01:32:09,732
Siya, I am not a rapist.

1088
01:32:10,058 --> 01:32:13,562
I know who..and what you are.

1089
01:32:14,563 --> 01:32:18,067
But..how can you decide
from such a distance?

1090
01:32:21,803 --> 01:32:23,111
I've already decided.

1091
01:32:23,271 --> 01:32:24,079
Then...

1092
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:28,585
Here's my resignation letter.

1093
01:32:40,288 --> 01:32:42,564
Do you want to spend
the night with this rapist?

1094
01:32:43,058 --> 01:32:44,469
You want to pay my bills?

1095
01:33:14,823 --> 01:33:20,637
"As I saw you...
my hear-t skipped a beat."

1096
01:33:20,829 --> 01:33:27,144
"It's not your fault,
it's my eyes that deceive me."

1097
01:33:32,741 --> 01:33:38,521
"As I saw you...
my hear-t skipped a beat."

1098
01:33:38,647 --> 01:33:44,359
"It's not your fault,
it's my eyes that deceive me."

1099
01:33:44,653 --> 01:33:47,497
"The thing you're scared of most..."

1100
01:33:47,556 --> 01:33:50,696
"...I'll do it for you."

1101
01:33:53,495 --> 01:33:59,377
"Don't look at me like so,
I'll take you in my arms."

1102
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:02,573
"I will steal you away..."

1103
01:34:02,704 --> 01:34:05,241
"...and hide you in my arms."

1104
01:34:05,307 --> 01:34:11,280
"Don't look at me like so,
I'll take you in my arms."

1105
01:34:11,346 --> 01:34:14,520
"I will steal you away..."

1106
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:17,425
"...and hide you in my arms."

1107
01:34:30,632 --> 01:34:39,416
"I never saw anyone like you before."

1108
01:34:39,541 --> 01:34:45,287
"Your sight takes my breath away."

1109
01:34:45,347 --> 01:34:48,294
"I never thought..."

1110
01:34:48,450 --> 01:34:54,298
"...this night will come to
a standstill in your arms."

1111
01:34:54,356 --> 01:35:00,204
"And my dawn star-ts from you."

1112
01:35:00,262 --> 01:35:03,209
"The thing you're scared of most..."

1113
01:35:03,265 --> 01:35:06,405
"...I'll do it for you."

1114
01:35:08,970 --> 01:35:14,943
"Don't look at me like so,
I'll take you in my arms."

1115
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:18,350
"I will steal you away..."

1116
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,983
"...and hide you in my arms."

1117
01:35:24,452 --> 01:35:26,955
"...and hide you in my arms."

1118
01:35:30,425 --> 01:35:32,598
"...and hide you in my arms."

1119
01:35:46,875 --> 01:35:47,683
Sir.

1120
01:35:48,376 --> 01:35:50,947
I feel your bad luck's
finally going to end today.

1121
01:35:52,247 --> 01:35:54,249
Ours. - Ohh...

1122
01:35:55,350 --> 01:35:56,260
sorry...

1123
01:36:37,359 --> 01:36:38,667
Passport - Thank you.

1124
01:36:42,897 --> 01:36:43,898
Excuse me, officer.

1125
01:36:47,502 --> 01:36:50,972
There's something I
want to say before I go.

1126
01:37:00,448 --> 01:37:01,324
Bye-bye.

1127
01:37:10,091 --> 01:37:13,732
"Now
calling for RT 2145...'

1128
01:37:14,062 --> 01:37:17,339
"Mumbai to New York
passengers are kindly requested..."

1129
01:37:17,399 --> 01:37:19,970
...to move
towards gate no. 5 for boarding."

1130
01:37:20,335 --> 01:37:21,006
"Thank you."

1131
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:30,414
"Passengers travelling from Mumbai
to New York are kindly requested..."

1132
01:37:30,512 --> 01:37:33,982
...to move
towards gate no. 5 for boarding."

1133
01:37:34,549 --> 01:37:35,550
"Thank you."

1134
01:37:54,602 --> 01:37:55,876
Are you on medication?

1135
01:37:56,137 --> 01:37:58,117
I mean. . .any
prescribed medication.

1136
01:37:59,908 --> 01:38:00,852
I am diabetic.

1137
01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:04,015
You need to be admitted right now.

1138
01:38:06,448 --> 01:38:08,394
No...l won't.

1139
01:38:08,483 --> 01:38:09,826
You want to die in mid-air?

1140
01:38:18,026 --> 01:38:20,097
Yeah...
- Sir, Rahul Oberoi suddenly fell sick.

1141
01:38:20,395 --> 01:38:21,772
He's being taken
to Life-Care Hospital.

1142
01:38:21,863 --> 01:38:22,933
What? - Yes, sir.

1143
01:38:25,033 --> 01:38:28,014
Seems like Rahul Oberoi's
bad luck isn't over yet.

1144
01:39:35,603 --> 01:39:36,081
Mak.

1145
01:39:36,604 --> 01:39:38,811
Mak. Listen to me, buddy.

1146
01:39:39,207 --> 01:39:41,881
We can talk it out.
Please listen to me.

1147
01:39:42,176 --> 01:39:45,214
L...l didn't rape Rajni.

1148
01:39:46,114 --> 01:39:47,184
You can trust me.

1149
01:39:47,815 --> 01:39:49,021
Let me convince you.

1150
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:50,490
Let me convince you.

1151
01:39:50,685 --> 01:39:52,824
I'll give you enough money,
so that Rajni and you...

1152
01:39:53,488 --> 01:39:55,934
...can live comfortably
for the rest of your lives.

1153
01:39:56,491 --> 01:39:58,164
Please leave me.

1154
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:00,564
Everyone makes mistakes.

1155
01:40:02,964 --> 01:40:05,774
I apologies.
I surrender.

1156
01:40:09,671 --> 01:40:12,880
I'll accept any punishment
that the law gives me.

1157
01:40:13,007 --> 01:40:14,111
I Will take it.

1158
01:40:15,043 --> 01:40:19,514
But...please don't kill me man.

1159
01:40:19,614 --> 01:40:20,615
Don't kill me.

1160
01:40:21,583 --> 01:40:23,085
We won't kill you, Rahul.

1161
01:40:37,131 --> 01:40:39,111
We will make
an example out of you.

1162
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:41,676
Siya? You?

1163
01:40:42,236 --> 01:40:44,614
Just like you did with our lives.

1164
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:18,781
'What is it?'

1165
01:41:22,744 --> 01:41:23,688
'1211.'

1166
01:41:28,650 --> 01:41:29,754
'Rahul, are you watching?'

1167
01:41:42,263 --> 01:41:43,139
Hi, Rahul.

1168
01:41:44,032 --> 01:41:45,033
What the f*** Siya?

1169
01:41:46,067 --> 01:41:46,704
You too.

1170
01:41:46,768 --> 01:41:49,009
No Rahul, just me.

1171
01:41:49,637 --> 01:41:51,207
How have I harmed you?

1172
01:41:52,674 --> 01:41:53,618
Oh, but you did.

1173
01:41:54,609 --> 01:41:55,110
What?

1174
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:58,386
Short circuit, Rahul.
Short circuit.

1175
01:42:01,049 --> 01:42:03,825
It didn't just happen...it
was made to happen.

1176
01:42:05,887 --> 01:42:09,630
And the person who
died...wasn't just a witness.

1177
01:42:11,025 --> 01:42:12,095
He was my father.

1178
01:42:14,696 --> 01:42:16,676
Dad, you've to be careful.

1179
01:42:16,898 --> 01:42:18,673
They are very powerful people.

1180
01:42:18,833 --> 01:42:22,371
If everyone gets intimidated...

1181
01:42:22,737 --> 01:42:25,650
...then people like Rahul
will commit rape, murder...

1182
01:42:25,773 --> 01:42:28,845
...and anything else they want.

1183
01:42:29,210 --> 01:42:33,681
I must step up...so that they
are scared of people like us.

1184
01:42:33,848 --> 01:42:35,020
I am proud of you, dad.

1185
01:42:44,659 --> 01:42:45,262
You people.

1186
01:42:45,860 --> 01:42:46,668
Sorry, sir.

1187
01:42:47,061 --> 01:42:47,835
We showed up uninvited.

1188
01:42:48,129 --> 01:42:49,870
Sharma sir,
we won't waste much of your time.

1189
01:42:50,264 --> 01:42:51,334
We just came to say sorry.

1190
01:42:51,666 --> 01:42:52,269
Dad.

1191
01:42:53,367 --> 01:42:56,075
We're sorry that...we'll
have to kill you.

1192
01:43:01,676 --> 01:43:02,279
Dad!

1193
01:43:07,915 --> 01:43:11,021
People like you never
achieve anything in life.

1194
01:43:11,719 --> 01:43:15,257
No success,
no fame or achievement.

1195
01:43:15,923 --> 01:43:18,199
But then you think of achieving
something in this old age.

1196
01:43:20,228 --> 01:43:24,768
You want to become a celebrity
by sending us to jail.

1197
01:43:26,134 --> 01:43:26,805
Dad!

1198
01:43:39,947 --> 01:43:40,948
Dad!

1199
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:46,460
Stop it your rascal.

1200
01:43:47,388 --> 01:43:49,390
We'll douse that
fire of activism in you...

1201
01:43:49,457 --> 01:43:53,405
...once and for all.

1202
01:43:58,933 --> 01:44:00,469
Please leave him! Please!

1203
01:44:04,839 --> 01:44:05,840
Stop it.
- What are you doing?

1204
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:07,442
What are you doing?
- Stop it.

1205
01:44:07,742 --> 01:44:10,416
Help. Anybody there!

1206
01:44:12,847 --> 01:44:13,791
Dad..

1207
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:18,863
Help. Anybody there!

1208
01:44:19,921 --> 01:44:20,922
Help.

1209
01:44:26,994 --> 01:44:28,371
Stop it please.

1210
01:44:29,864 --> 01:44:32,140
Anybody there? Help!

1211
01:44:56,023 --> 01:44:57,024
Leave him!

1212
01:44:58,492 --> 01:44:59,493
Dad!

1213
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:18,213
I saw my dad...die
right before my eyes.

1214
01:45:20,281 --> 01:45:22,283
And now...the world's
going to witness your death.

1215
01:45:23,551 --> 01:45:24,859
On your channel.

1216
01:45:39,533 --> 01:45:41,069
Mak has abducted Rahul.

1217
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:44,339
At any cost we've to stop
this murder from going live.

1218
01:45:44,438 --> 01:45:46,577
Use the best brains.
Do whatever you have to do.

1219
01:45:46,841 --> 01:45:49,845
Blow up the satellite...shutdown
their entire station if you have to.

1220
01:45:49,977 --> 01:45:51,979
We have to stop this. - Okay, sir.

1221
01:45:54,081 --> 01:45:55,958
How did Mak get to Rahul?

1222
01:45:56,550 --> 01:45:58,928
He's a sharp mind...Rahul Oberoi.

1223
01:45:59,020 --> 01:45:59,964
My foot.

1224
01:46:01,889 --> 01:46:04,335
I planted Mak in your office.

1225
01:46:10,231 --> 01:46:14,407
She tried to commit suicide,
but survived.

1226
01:46:15,903 --> 01:46:17,644
But ..she's as good as dead.

1227
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:19,941
So..what should we do now?

1228
01:46:20,474 --> 01:46:21,976
Mourn for them.

1229
01:46:22,877 --> 01:46:26,450
...or make an example
out of those responsible?

1230
01:46:35,456 --> 01:46:37,458
I kept track
of all your movements.

1231
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:42,134
I exchanged your insulin
shots with sugar syrup.

1232
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:08,522
In your efforts to
get me in your bed..

1233
01:47:09,023 --> 01:47:12,971
...you just walked
up to your own grave.

1234
01:47:18,165 --> 01:47:18,973
Guys.

1235
01:47:21,202 --> 01:47:22,408
Orders from the government.

1236
01:47:23,537 --> 01:47:24,538
We've to shut down.

1237
01:47:25,106 --> 01:47:25,982
Okay sir.

1238
01:47:30,277 --> 01:47:31,221
Rahul.

1239
01:47:33,214 --> 01:47:35,660
This is highly
concentrated sugar syrup.

1240
01:47:35,950 --> 01:47:36,690
No, Siya.

1241
01:47:36,951 --> 01:47:38,953
Siya you can't do this.

1242
01:47:39,020 --> 01:47:41,432
We will gradually
inject this in your body.

1243
01:47:41,555 --> 01:47:42,966
Siya, don't do this.

1244
01:47:46,494 --> 01:47:48,997
Your sugar levels
will star-t increasing.

1245
01:47:50,331 --> 01:47:52,038
And there will come a time"

1246
01:47:52,233 --> 01:47:53,974
...when your body won't be
able to tolerate the sweetness.

1247
01:47:54,035 --> 01:47:54,638
Siya.

1248
01:47:55,703 --> 01:47:56,477
Siya, don't.

1249
01:47:56,537 --> 01:48:00,610
All the toxic elements..will
go to your brain.

1250
01:48:06,447 --> 01:48:10,452
And then..you will in
a state of diabetic coma.

1251
01:48:13,354 --> 01:48:14,230
Rahul.

1252
01:48:15,689 --> 01:48:17,464
It's time for
your television debut.

1253
01:48:41,782 --> 01:48:42,522
Siya.

1254
01:48:44,752 --> 01:48:47,323
I think the GTN frequency
cannot be hacked.

1255
01:48:49,557 --> 01:48:50,558
I think they got us.

1256
01:48:56,197 --> 01:48:57,141
Well done, Kabir.

1257
01:48:59,233 --> 01:49:00,143
Smart.

1258
01:49:02,303 --> 01:49:05,284
But how can
you..stop him from dying.

1259
01:49:07,374 --> 01:49:08,182
Sir.

1260
01:49:09,677 --> 01:49:11,714
I've found some new
information from the court.

1261
01:49:11,812 --> 01:49:13,291
"About the Rajni rape case.

1262
01:49:13,714 --> 01:49:17,560
It also has details..on Sharma,
the main witness.

1263
01:49:23,124 --> 01:49:28,767
After the death of Brijendra Sharma,
the witness in Rajni rape case.

1264
01:49:29,196 --> 01:49:33,303
"His daughter Ankita
Sharma claimed his body.

1265
01:49:34,735 --> 01:49:37,477
Studying at Massachusetts
School of Law.

1266
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:41,283
Gaitonde, how did we miss this?

1267
01:49:44,812 --> 01:49:46,519
Sweet revenge Rahul Oberoi.

1268
01:49:47,181 --> 01:49:49,422
My revenge is complete.

1269
01:49:50,784 --> 01:49:52,161
No.

1270
01:49:53,821 --> 01:49:54,731
...it's still incomplete.

1271
01:49:57,291 --> 01:49:59,771
It wasn't three...

1272
01:50:02,163 --> 01:50:03,233
...but four of us.

1273
01:50:06,867 --> 01:50:08,710
That's an old trick Rahul.

1274
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:10,741
You're lying.

1275
01:50:12,173 --> 01:50:15,120
The truth is..that you're dying.

1276
01:50:16,443 --> 01:50:21,722
A dying man never lies.

1277
01:50:27,855 --> 01:50:29,232
There's a fourth person.

1278
01:50:31,225 --> 01:50:32,226
The mastermind.

1279
01:50:32,326 --> 01:50:34,328
Who? Who's the fourth one?

1280
01:50:35,596 --> 01:50:36,404
You..

1281
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:40,201
You know him.

1282
01:50:41,335 --> 01:50:43,611
Speak up you rascaLspeak!

1283
01:50:47,241 --> 01:50:51,815
You..you just killed the pawns.

1284
01:50:52,213 --> 01:50:52,918
Who?

1285
01:50:54,682 --> 01:50:58,687
The real mastermind..was him.

1286
01:50:59,186 --> 01:51:00,631
Who? Who?

1287
01:51:01,922 --> 01:51:04,493
Your.. Your..

1288
01:51:06,293 --> 01:51:07,772
Boyfriend, Ranveer.

1289
01:51:42,763 --> 01:51:44,709
Hello, I am calling from India.

1290
01:51:44,898 --> 01:51:48,846
I need some information about
an ex-student. Ankita Sharma.

1291
01:51:49,203 --> 01:51:51,547
She graduated four years
back from your college.

1292
01:51:51,939 --> 01:51:53,714
Please connect me
to the right person.

1293
01:51:53,807 --> 01:51:56,447
I am sorry, sir. But we
cannot disclose any information.

1294
01:51:56,543 --> 01:51:58,887
"Without checking
proper procedures first.

1295
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:02,352
Ma'am, I am calling from the
Maharashtra State Police Department.

1296
01:52:02,683 --> 01:52:05,289
I can send you the paperwork,
but then it might be too late.

1297
01:52:05,686 --> 01:52:08,758
We need your law school
to cooperate the law-keepers here.

1298
01:52:08,956 --> 01:52:10,765
Alright.
- Right, thank you.

1299
01:52:10,958 --> 01:52:15,236
Your mail ID is?
- It's admin

1300
01:52:15,796 --> 01:52:16,570
Thank you.

1301
01:52:29,376 --> 01:52:32,721
Gaitonde,
this case is like an onion.

1302
01:52:34,315 --> 01:52:36,625
Peel one layer off..and
there's another.

1303
01:52:37,318 --> 01:52:38,854
I can't understand.

1304
01:52:58,038 --> 01:53:00,575
Ankita is equal to Siya.

1305
01:53:03,444 --> 01:53:05,924
Siya is equal to Ankita.

1306
01:53:08,615 --> 01:53:10,822
Maybe this is the last layer.

1307
01:53:14,488 --> 01:53:15,831
We need to catch Siya.

1308
01:54:38,372 --> 01:54:40,978
I hate you! I hate you!

1309
01:54:41,074 --> 01:54:42,781
I hate you!

1310
01:55:28,155 --> 01:55:29,600
Siya, where the hell are you?

1311
01:55:29,690 --> 01:55:31,431
I've been trying
to call you for so long.

1312
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:38,200
Ranveer..l want
to take you somewhere.

1313
01:55:50,711 --> 01:55:52,987
You didn't say a word throughout.

1314
01:55:54,081 --> 01:55:55,059
Now this place.

1315
01:55:56,149 --> 01:55:58,993
What's so special
Siya..about this place?

1316
01:55:59,219 --> 01:56:00,664
Do you love me, Ranveer?

1317
01:56:01,555 --> 01:56:02,056
What?

1318
01:56:02,789 --> 01:56:04,200
How much do you love me?

1319
01:56:04,558 --> 01:56:06,060
Siya..
- How much?

1320
01:56:07,928 --> 01:56:09,498
I love you so much that.

1321
01:56:09,530 --> 01:56:13,137
...I can kill or give
up my life for you.

1322
01:56:20,073 --> 01:56:21,108
My dad's as well?

1323
01:56:22,209 --> 01:56:23,210
Are you alright?

1324
01:56:23,977 --> 01:56:25,115
What are you blabbering?

1325
01:56:26,213 --> 01:56:28,193
Brijender Sharma was my father,
Ranveer.

1326
01:56:32,719 --> 01:56:34,630
Brijender Sharma?
- Yes.

1327
01:56:36,890 --> 01:56:41,532
Sarnaik,
Karan, RahuLthey all knew him.

1328
01:56:41,862 --> 01:56:43,273
So I killed them all.

1329
01:56:45,599 --> 01:56:46,543
Right here.

1330
01:57:18,599 --> 01:57:20,601
You can give your life for me,
Ranveer.

1331
01:57:21,602 --> 01:57:23,582
But I love you a lot.

1332
01:57:24,271 --> 01:57:26,217
I can spare your life.

1333
01:57:28,075 --> 01:57:29,110
Just do one thing.

1334
01:57:29,876 --> 01:57:31,651
Admit to your crimes.

1335
01:57:33,113 --> 01:57:34,820
Handover yourself to the law.

1336
01:57:37,684 --> 01:57:41,962
You only told half the story
about Rajni rape case to Kabir.

1337
01:57:42,723 --> 01:57:43,758
Now complete it.

1338
01:57:44,891 --> 01:57:46,234
Tell him the truth.

1339
01:57:47,694 --> 01:57:49,696
Even I will admit to my crimes,
Ranveer.

1340
01:57:49,763 --> 01:57:51,868
Go to jail..for what?

1341
01:57:52,599 --> 01:57:54,806
I didn't work this
hard to rot behind bars.

1342
01:57:55,602 --> 01:57:57,275
I was a poor lawyer,
struggling my way through.

1343
01:57:58,071 --> 01:58:00,574
I wanted to move up in life,
and who doesn't?

1344
01:58:01,608 --> 01:58:03,747
Whatever I did,
I only did it for my career.

1345
01:58:05,812 --> 01:58:07,018
And who the hell is Kabir?

1346
01:58:07,648 --> 01:58:09,218
Why should I confess to him?

1347
01:58:11,718 --> 01:58:12,696
I'll tell you.

1348
01:58:19,660 --> 01:58:22,334
Did you hear..my thank you?

1349
01:58:22,629 --> 01:58:26,042
It's alright, Mr.
Lawyer. We'll meet in court.

1350
01:58:26,133 --> 01:58:29,808
Karan sir, you should've
made a more fitting offer.

1351
01:58:29,870 --> 01:58:30,940
We respect you, Kabir.

1352
01:58:31,104 --> 01:58:33,084
We never met a talented
lawyer like you.

1353
01:58:34,708 --> 01:58:36,187
But what's the
use of such honesty?

1354
01:58:37,377 --> 01:58:41,382
A flat..10 million..and a car.

1355
01:58:41,682 --> 01:58:42,990
And your life will be set.

1356
01:58:44,718 --> 01:58:45,321
That it?

1357
01:58:45,986 --> 01:58:47,090
Is that all you respect me?

1358
01:58:47,354 --> 01:58:48,230
Oh, sir..

1359
01:58:49,389 --> 01:58:52,336
Your offer tells me that
you don't respect me at all.

1360
01:58:52,392 --> 01:58:54,394
<i>My scorner has
s"""" my waver-back.</i>

1361
01:58:54,961 --> 01:58:56,838
If you win the case.

1362
01:58:56,997 --> 01:58:58,806
...you'll catch your
chartered plane to Hawaii.

1363
01:58:59,032 --> 01:58:59,908
Won't you?

1364
01:59:02,803 --> 01:59:06,148
Once in Hawaii,
you will relax in a big penthouse.

1365
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:09,281
Even I deserve a small
sea-facing penthouse.

1366
01:59:10,877 --> 01:59:13,153
And if you win the case..which
I don't think you will.

1367
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:16,284
But if you do..you will
make at least a billion or two.

1368
01:59:16,683 --> 01:59:17,684
Oh my God.

1369
01:59:18,819 --> 01:59:21,356
I at least deserve 100 million,
with due respect.

1370
01:59:21,788 --> 01:59:22,789
Tell me your plan,

1371
01:59:22,989 --> 01:59:24,161
Well..

1372
01:59:26,193 --> 01:59:28,195
...just stop that witness
from coming to the court.

1373
01:59:29,896 --> 01:59:31,341
And I will control my emotions.

1374
01:59:31,431 --> 01:59:33,240
Your dad had to die.

1375
01:59:33,734 --> 01:59:36,908
Wouldn't they have thought about
it, if I hadn't given them that idea?

1376
01:59:37,170 --> 01:59:38,080
Of course.

1377
01:59:38,338 --> 01:59:40,147
But I didn't know he was your dad.

1378
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:42,920
If I had known you,
if we had been in love...

1379
01:59:43,043 --> 01:59:44,351
...you think I would've
let your dad die?

1380
01:59:44,444 --> 01:59:45,855
No way, Siya. No way.

1381
01:59:45,946 --> 01:59:48,722
Back then I just
grabbed the opportunity.

1382
01:59:48,949 --> 01:59:53,329
I tried to keep you away from Rahul,
because I knew what a rascal he is.

1383
01:59:53,820 --> 01:59:55,163
I love you always, Siya.

1384
01:59:55,355 --> 01:59:58,234
Forgive me for your dad,
it was not my fault.

1385
01:59:59,159 --> 02:00:01,366
Sometimes we've to do
these things in our profession.

1386
02:00:01,461 --> 02:00:02,337
Everyone does it.

1387
02:00:02,429 --> 02:00:03,305
And yes...

1388
02:00:03,396 --> 02:00:05,398
Please stop lecturing me about.

1389
02:00:05,465 --> 02:00:07,172
Surrender to the
law' and 'Face the truth'.

1390
02:00:07,367 --> 02:00:08,038
What is this, Siya?

1391
02:00:08,101 --> 02:00:09,842
We've our entire life ahead of us.

1392
02:00:09,970 --> 02:00:13,349
You don't get it, Ranveer.
I don't want to live with you.

1393
02:00:13,907 --> 02:00:17,320
I can't spend a moment
with my dad's murderer.

1394
02:00:17,911 --> 02:00:20,152
Why bring someone
who's dead between us?

1395
02:00:20,347 --> 02:00:21,849
I am apologizing to you?

1396
02:00:22,048 --> 02:00:23,118
You want forgiveness.

1397
02:00:23,450 --> 02:00:24,394
Fine...I'll forgive you.

1398
02:00:24,985 --> 02:00:27,795
But please Ranveer,
admit your crime.

1399
02:00:29,356 --> 02:00:31,336
Like father like daughter.

1400
02:00:31,458 --> 02:00:34,735
Don't you get a simple thing
that everything will be ruined.

1401
02:00:35,395 --> 02:00:39,775
Your father died because
of his obstinacy, and so will you.

1402
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:41,871
Take my dad's name with respect,
Ranveer.

1403
02:00:44,471 --> 02:00:46,473
You just have to surrender
yourself to Kabir.

1404
02:00:46,807 --> 02:00:47,808
Surrender?

1405
02:00:48,742 --> 02:00:50,813
Don't forget that
you're a lawyer as well.

1406
02:00:51,311 --> 02:00:52,346
And what do you think?

1407
02:00:52,779 --> 02:00:54,759
I will get punished
if I surrender.

1408
02:00:54,815 --> 02:00:58,490
For that you need proof,
or I will have to confess.

1409
02:00:58,752 --> 02:00:59,457
And I won't.

1410
02:00:59,786 --> 02:01:01,788
You don't have to confess.

1411
02:01:02,856 --> 02:01:03,766
Meaning?

1412
02:01:03,857 --> 02:01:06,337
I mean...you've already confessed.

1413
02:01:19,506 --> 02:01:20,507
Cut the phone, Siya.

1414
02:01:23,877 --> 02:01:25,550
I say cut the phone Siya, or else...

1415
02:01:26,012 --> 02:01:26,854
Or else?

1416
02:01:26,913 --> 02:01:29,223
Or else what?
You will kill me too.

1417
02:01:30,016 --> 02:01:31,256
If I have to.

1418
02:02:24,905 --> 02:02:30,912
"I fell deeply in love with you..."

1419
02:02:30,944 --> 02:02:33,254
"The reason is you."

1420
02:02:34,247 --> 02:02:36,989
"The reason is you."

1421
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:29,335
Kabir, you're mistaken.

1422
02:04:29,429 --> 02:04:31,431
She killed Rahul,
Karan and Sarnaik.

1423
02:04:31,498 --> 02:04:34,445
You do the wrong
deeds...and I am mistaken.

1424
02:04:36,569 --> 02:04:38,742
Surrender yourself, Ranveer.

1425
02:04:39,039 --> 02:04:40,211
Surrender myself?

1426
02:04:41,074 --> 02:04:41,711
<i>I see...</i>

1427
02:04:44,377 --> 02:04:46,516
It will take me less
than an hour to get out.

1428
02:04:49,449 --> 02:04:50,450
Only time will tell...

1429
02:06:23,276 --> 02:06:26,814
We're two sides of the same coin,
Ranveer.

1430
02:06:28,081 --> 02:06:30,220
But you lost the toss today.

1431
02:06:31,351 --> 02:06:32,489
Game over.

1432
02:06:43,830 --> 02:06:49,712
"The reason...l feel
overwhelmed every season..."

1433
02:06:49,769 --> 02:06:52,306
"The reason is you."

1434
02:06:53,273 --> 02:06:56,152
"The reason is you."

1435
02:07:13,326 --> 02:07:15,135
I can't believe this Ranveer.

1436
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:19,337
But I will live with this truth...

1437
02:07:23,670 --> 02:07:27,550
...that you're the reason
for all my crimes.

1438
02:08:02,342 --> 02:08:07,849
Sometimes we've to
live with pain, Siya.

1439
02:08:34,474 --> 02:08:35,953
There's good news for you.

1440
02:08:37,343 --> 02:08:38,845
Your case has been closed.

1441
02:08:43,216 --> 02:08:46,993
You could've
have arrested me, Kabir.

1442
02:08:48,621 --> 02:08:51,500
I listened to my hear-t instead.

1443
02:08:52,792 --> 02:08:54,567
I did what I thought was right.

1444
02:08:56,996 --> 02:09:00,000
Can you continue doing
your job with this burden?

1445
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:01,370
I resigned.

1446
02:09:04,570 --> 02:09:06,516
Now I'll spend
some time with Suhani.

1447
02:09:07,307 --> 02:09:09,548
And open up a private
security firm or something.

1448
02:09:10,877 --> 02:09:12,914
How is Suhani?
- She's fine.

1449
02:09:13,012 --> 02:09:15,288
And she's the main
dancer in the concert now.

1450
02:09:16,316 --> 02:09:17,021
Good.

1451
02:09:17,984 --> 02:09:22,433
I pray to God that every
father has a daughter like you.

1452
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:25,333
You're a good dad, Kabir.

1453
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:28,668
You're a better daughter.

1454
02:09:48,681 --> 02:09:54,632
"The reason...l feel
overwhelmed every season..."

1455
02:09:54,687 --> 02:09:57,293
"The reason is you."

1456
02:09:58,024 --> 02:10:00,971
"The reason is you."

1457
02:10:02,462 --> 02:10:08,538
"I was shattered in pieces...but
I feel complete now..."

1458
02:10:09,469 --> 02:10:15,420
"I strolled down
your lane every day."

1459
02:10:15,475 --> 02:10:17,512
"The reason is you."

1460
02:10:18,978 --> 02:10:21,424
"The reason is you."

1461
02:10:22,515 --> 02:10:25,394
"The reason is you."

1462
02:10:25,918 --> 02:10:28,524
"The reason is you."

1463
02:10:44,470 --> 02:10:50,819
"I was never
like I am these days."

1464
02:10:51,411 --> 02:10:57,054
"I was never
like I am these days."

1465
02:10:58,351 --> 02:11:04,700
"I hardly meet anyone
else...except for you."

1466
02:11:05,091 --> 02:11:11,906
"I hardly meet anyone
else...except for you."

1467
02:11:12,098 --> 02:11:18,071
"I've star-ted
changing these days..."

1468
02:11:18,137 --> 02:11:20,674
"The reason is you."

1469
02:11:21,607 --> 02:11:24,053
"The reason is you."
