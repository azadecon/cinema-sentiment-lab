1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,002


2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,008


3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,012


4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,016


5
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,196
I haven't done anything, man!

6
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,296
Ma'am has come...

7
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,399
'Get your girlfriends along...'

8
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:23,038
Good morning, guys.
- Good morning, ma'am.

9
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,715
Good morning.

10
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,550
Early morning...1st lecture.

11
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:35,182
And that too biology...

12
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,661
Sad, no?
- Yes, ma'am.

13
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,155
But... it's important to study.

14
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,594
But waking up at
<i>6</i> o'clock in the morning...

15
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:43,759
Should be of some use...

16
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,294
Isn't it?

17
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,437
By the way, did you catch
the Sci-fi film 'Space Bound'?

18
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,642
Yes, ma'am. What a movie!

19
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:53,476
Is it good?

20
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,713
Have you seen it.
- I think I've seen the trailer.

21
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,112
Why don't you go with him?
- Why should I?

22
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,151
Blushing and all, huh!

23
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,318
Nice movie.

24
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,121
Well, today we'll study the different
muscle groups in the Human Body.

25
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:08,190
There are 639 muscles
in the Human Body...

26
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,818
...and each has a unique function.

27
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,223
Let's start with this portion here.

28
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,322
' Rectus us Abdominus I nus'.

29
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,501
Also known as...

30
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,406
Popularly known as the six-packs.

31
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,138
Mind blowing...
- Hello, guys.

32
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,444
This is still a biology class.
Concentrate.

33
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,616
The function of the
'Rectus Abdominus' is...

34
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,483
...flexing at the abdomen.

35
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,518
It runs vertically
across the stomach...

36
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:43,219
...and is separated from the
skin by a layer of fat and water.

37
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,190
You' re a pervert!

38
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,287
This is called the Transverse abdominus.
- What happened, Arya?

39
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,593
Look, what he has sent.
- And these here are the oblique's.

40
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,031
Yuck!
- They are...

41
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,432
What's going on there?

42
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,096
Nothing, ma'am.

43
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,770
What happened here?

44
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,112
Nothing, ma'am.

45
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,307
You both leave the class now.

46
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,516
Ma'am...it's not our fault.

47
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,519
Look what Mohit sent to Arya.

48
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,420
Everyone knows
'No phones inside the class'.

49
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,749
Give me your phone.

50
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:41,710
I am sorry, ma'am.

51
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,520
Your phone!

52
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,418
I won't do it again,
promise, last chance.

53
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,083
I won't repeat myself.

54
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,405
Tell your parents to come see me.

55
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,672
Now back to class.

56
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,556
Is my black suit
back from the cleaners?

57
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,553
Yes, it's in the closet.

58
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,426
Sis is coming.
- Okay, sit down.

59
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,267
Madam... what's in your hand, madam?

60
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,466
It's nothing, madam.

61
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,771
It's definitely something, madam.

62
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,408
Chocolate. Your sister
gave it to you, didn't she?

63
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,504
How did you know, mom?

64
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:50,085
Mom has 10 eyes...
She can see everything.

65
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,755
Even I can't hide anything from her.

66
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,617
Show me your 10 eyes.

67
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:57,217
Show me. Show me.
- No...it's a secret.

68
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,284
I can't tell you.

69
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,193
Come child.

70
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,491
How was your day?
- Ask her.

71
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,800
Cottage-cheese...
- It's alright, I'll help myself.

72
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,768
Anand, the kids
holidays are approaching.

73
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,244
Let's decide where to go.

74
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,273
We'll need time for
tickets and hotel bookings.

75
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,508
Last minute everything
becomes very expensive.

76
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,744
Dad, can I suggest where
we should go? - Where?

77
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,283
See...
- Wow! Beautiful.

78
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,253
See...

79
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:28,582
It's really nice.

80
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,425
Where is this?
- Show me.

81
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,528
Close to Kufri.
- Wow.

82
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,087
Fine...let's plan once I am back.

83
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,062
Devki, please handle the bookings,
etc.

84
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,262
Sure.
- I've figured out everything, dad.

85
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,328
I'll tell you everything
when you're back.

86
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:47,037
How long will you be gone, dad?
- 10 days.

87
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,270
What do you want from New York?

88
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,776
Eiffel Tower.

89
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,281
The Eiffel Tower is in Paris.

90
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,015
Then go to Paris instead,
why are you going to New York.

91
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:02,354
By the way, dad,
you're looking quite handsome today.

92
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,250
What do you want?

93
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,588
Don't you know how
to take a compliment?

94
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,427
The last time I looked handsome...

95
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,727
...I had to buy her a
mobile phone worth 40,000.

96
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,598
So, what do you want?

97
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:19,137
There's a party on Saturday night.
All my friends are going.

98
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,337
Do you know about this?

99
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,643
Saturday is Valentine's Day, right?
- So?

100
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,608
No... nothing.

101
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,220
Where's the party?

102
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,047
Can <i>I</i> g0. Papa?

103
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,124
But where's the party?

104
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,050
Zodiac Farms,
it's not too far from here.

105
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,126
No, that's too far.

106
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,695
It is very far.

107
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,402
Who else is going?
- Like I said...all my friends.

108
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,694
Is Sapna going?
- Hmm.

109
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,501
And Rishi?
- Hmm.

110
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,403
Any more questions, ma'am?

111
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,642
Arya.
- What?

112
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,342
I am asking for your permission.

113
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,147
Fine, we'll think about it.

114
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,151
What's there to think?
Don't you trust me?

115
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,046
Of course dear, we trust you.
- Then?

116
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,720
Do you need mam's
approval for this too?

117
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,724
Arya, behave yourself!

118
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,423
Arya. Arya.

119
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,474
It's no ordinary event.
It's the hottest party in Delhi.

120
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,582
Kabir's coming as well.

121
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:38,053
You should propose to him.
- Have you lost your mind?

122
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,282
I mean...

123
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,287
Catch you later.
- Bye.

124
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:47,557
Dinner.

125
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,559
I spoke to your dad.

126
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,663
He's agreed.

127
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,399
You can go to the party.

128
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,472
What are you going to wear?

129
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,611
Never vent your anger on food.

130
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,213
Finish your dinner.

131
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,353
Goodnight, dear.

132
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,551
I don't feel like leaving
you guys and going.

133
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,055
What do you think?

134
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,627
Arya was right.

135
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,392
You're really looking
handsome nowadays.

136
00:10:58,758 --> 00:10:59,600
Really?

137
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,563
What is it that you want?
- I see...

138
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:11,274
Just finish your conference
and come back soon.

139
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:19,214
I know... you always handle everything.

140
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,686
But... I'll try talking to Arya again.

141
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:30,228
She just can't share you with anyone.

142
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:36,268
Actually,
it's we who need to understand her.

143
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,779
Rajender, Look after the house.

144
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,704
Yes, sir.
- Dad.

145
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,081
What's the matter? You didn't
Whatsapp your shopping list yet.

146
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,144
Don't you want anything?

147
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,657
Dad...

148
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,254
I am sorry for last night.

149
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,463
I know I hurt you and ma'am.

150
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,166
When will you stop calling her that?

151
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,803
She's your mother.

152
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,340
You've forgotten my mother...

153
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,642
...but not me.

154
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:24,349
What I did for us was right.

155
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,757
I could've never raised
you without Devki.

156
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,323
She has accepted us.

157
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:33,628
She never differentiated
between you and Priya.

158
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,088
I have accepted Piyu.

159
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,697
It's always the mother
who's blessed with a daughter.

160
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,439
And not the other way around.

161
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,515
I can't do it, dad.
I can't let her down.

162
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,151
I miss her.

163
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,680
I really miss her.
- My child...

164
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,097
Go enjoy your party.

165
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,463
Papa.

166
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,504
Mr. Anand.
- Yeah.

167
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:20,271
What good is your laptop without this?

168
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,304
Oh my, God...
Where's my passport?

169
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,576
Your passport and tickets
are in the right zip.

170
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,716
Right zip.

171
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,676
What will I do without you?

172
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,415
Okay, bye.
- Bye.

173
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,155
Bye.
- Bye.

174
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,668
Come soon.
- I will.

175
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,226
Bye.
- Bye.

176
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,203
Bye.

177
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,211
Mina, see who's at the door.
- Yes.

178
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,111
Is Devki madam at home?
We're her students.

179
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,483
Ma'am, your students are here.

180
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,047
Fine, I'll be right there.

181
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:10,616
Hello, madam.

182
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,357
Niranjana, what brings you here?

183
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,592
Hello, madam.
- Hello. Come in.

184
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:16,823
Sit.

185
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,194
Sit, Rohini.

186
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,469
We just started a new business...

187
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:23,733
Tie and Dye.

188
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:27,673
And to share this joy please
accept these sweets from our side.

189
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,307
This is amazing... very good.

190
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,050
None of this was possible without you.

191
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,682
You educated us...

192
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,413
Gave us respect.

193
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,052
And as a result,
we're independent now.

194
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,349
No-no...it's all because
of your hard work.

195
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,418
Is that your elder daughter
you always talk about?

196
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,165
Yes.
- I see...

197
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,365
How about some tea or juice? - No need
for formalities. We'll be leaving now.

198
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,769
See you on Thursday,
keep your assignments ready. - Yes.

199
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,110
Dear. Sweets?

200
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,743
What do you talk to them about me?

201
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,375
Nothing.
Just generally...

202
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:11,821
Nice things only.

203
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,820
I've no objection
to your social service.

204
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:19,118
But you don't have
to talk to anyone about me.

205
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,157
Didn't you tell them?

206
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:24,727
What?

207
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,661
That I am not your daughter, ma'am.

208
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,479
Sweets.

209
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,730
Hey...

210
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,133
What are you doing, Piyu?

211
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,343
Stop. . . stop. . . stop.

212
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,745
Hurry up now, it's too late.

213
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,181
Just one more line to go.

214
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,253
Sweet kid.

215
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,090
Hi, Kabir.

216
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,409
Don't be too late, please.

217
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,042
Yes, ma'am... don't worry.

218
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,740
And Rishi, I hope your driver's...

219
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,075
Arya...

220
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,045
You're looking so pretty.

221
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,322
Thanks.

222
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,718
Isn't it, Piyu? Dear...
- Yes.

223
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,125
Wow.
- Arya, is your phone charged?

224
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,155
Yes.

225
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,465
Take care. Have fun.

226
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:48,507
<i>Bro.</i>

227
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,209
Bro?
- Yeah.

228
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,083
Remember I told you
about this girl I like.

229
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,053
Whose mother broke your phone?

230
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,255
Yes, her.

231
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,184
That's her, in red.

232
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,226
So why are you wasting your time here?

233
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,128
Should I go?
- Go.

234
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,105
My bag.

235
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,439
Come on. Let's dance.

236
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:30,051
"It's my life."

237
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,147
"It's my life."

238
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:40,656
"I'll live it the way I like."

239
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:48,060
"I'll live it the way I like."

240
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,235
You're looking hot.

241
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:56,679
How about a dance?

242
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,113
Excuse me, she's not interested
in you. Don't you get it?

243
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,310
Please leave.
- It's just one dance.

244
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,148
But she's not interested.

245
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,518
Come on, it's Valentine's Day...
- Get lost you sicko.

246
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,268
"It's my life."

247
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,069
"It's my life."

248
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,379
Hello... Yeah, dad I'm
heading to the airport... coming.

249
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,542
I'm leaving now.

250
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,415
Sh” it's dad again, I've to go.

251
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,987
But I'll be back.
- Okay... Okay bye.

252
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,555
Did you get the stuff?
- The best.

253
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,056
Full power. 24 hour.

254
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,027
What's wrong, Bunty, huh?

255
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,403
Doesn't she know it's Valentine's Day?

256
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,333
Why is she acting so pricey?

257
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,374
Do you want her?

258
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:11,249
Bunty, do you want her?
- What can you do?

259
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,299
Watch and learn from the best.

260
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,111
Hi.
- Hi.

261
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,677
Charles Deewan.
- Arya.

262
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,278
I like what you're wearing.
- Thank you.

263
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,584
Would you like to
have a drink with me?

264
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,123
No, thanks.

265
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,694
Your Boyfriend?

266
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,390
None of your business.

267
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,457
I don't mind.
- Hey, wait...

268
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,327
How much more are you going to drink?

269
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,129
I am single.

270
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,400
Sorry, I am Sapna.

271
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,468
Do I look like a waiter to you?

272
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,360
"Watch and learn from the best."

273
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,384
"The best..."

274
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:26,485
Shut up!

275
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,297
Try being polite with them, and...

276
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,811
Why don't you tell him?
- What?

277
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,447
That you like him?
- Are you mad?

278
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,150
Here...

279
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,158
Just go...go...
- Red rose!

280
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,660
Go I am telling you.

281
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:41,434
"Crow caws on the rooftop."

282
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,264
Let's go home.

283
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,336
Come on.

284
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:48,606
Forget him.

285
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:54,208
What's wrong?
- I feel dizzy.

286
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,683
Let Rishi come.

287
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,483
Stay here, I'll call a cab.

288
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:12,296
"On the rooftop..."

289
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,295
Yes, ma'am.

290
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:16,331
Hold on.

291
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,234
Yeah.

292
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,338
I'll be home in 40-45 minutes.

293
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:23,371
What?

294
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,271
Yeah, okay.

295
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,408
Taxi.

296
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,352
You...

297
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,095
Wait"

298
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:44,389
You...

299
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,794
Hold her! Hold her!
- She's kicking.

300
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,034
Hurry up
- Hold her legs! Hold her legs!

301
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:59,709
Who is he?
- He's a friend. Drive.

302
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,113
Hold her legs - Tie her hands

303
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:05,212
Now call your mom!

304
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,258
Now call your mom!

305
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:13,392
Shut her mouth.

306
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,123
Call your mother!

307
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:46,651
Indu...Arya hasn't come home yet.

308
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,685
Indu.
- Sister, Did Arya come home?

309
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,624
Not yet.

310
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:02,164
Stay with Piyu, I'll go get her.
- Okay.

311
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,268
And keep trying Arya's number.
- Okay.

312
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:05,767
<i>Keep tryiflQ-</i>

313
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,713
"I scare away one, two, a plenty few."

314
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,583
"My beloved is to meet me at midnight,
my hean races."

315
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:36,093
"I scare away one, two, a plenty few."

316
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:40,397
"My beloved is to meet me at midnight,
my hean races."

317
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:45,638
"The guard's stick hurts,
it hurts badly."

318
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:50,702
"The guard's stick hurts,
it hurts badly."

319
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,209
"Run for your life, if you get caught,
plead for your life."

320
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:56,275
Where is Arya?
- What, Ma'am?

321
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,714
Where is Arya? - Don't know.
She was here a while ago.

322
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,189
I can't reach her.

323
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,459
It's been two hours
since she left for home...

324
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,290
Wasn't she with Sapna and Rishi?

325
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,590
Yes, ma'am. - Rishi, has no clue.
He doesn't know anything.

326
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:11,122
Come on let's dance. - And, Sapna,
she doesn't know anything.

327
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,530
I am really sorry, ma'am.
- We don't know.

328
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:15,593
Sorry, ma'am.

329
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,038
I told Rishi to take care of her.

330
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,108
Sir...

331
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:35,521
Sir...sir...l need your help.
- Yes.

332
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:39,085
My daughter hasn't reached home yet.
Please help me.

333
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:42,165
I am tensed...
- Get a glass of water for the lady.

334
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:45,257
My daughter was attending
a party at the farm house...

335
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:46,563
I'm trying her phone...

336
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:47,762
What's the name of your daughter...

337
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,504
...and which farmhouse did she go to?

338
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,333
Arya Sabarwal.

339
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,369
Zodiac Farm.

340
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,037
Yeah... what's the problem?

341
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,039
Her daughter's disappeared.

342
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:03,343
She hasn't disappeared...
She just hasn't returned home yet.

343
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,351
Take a seat, ma'am.
- Sir, I am very worried.

344
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,584
I've been trying to call her...

345
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:09,647
...but it's unavailable.
- Please.

346
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,489
Sit down and tell us everything.

347
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:15,323
What's the age of your daughter?
- 18 years.

348
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,030
Give us her phone number.

349
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:20,966
Sure?

350
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,398
Get to work and trace
this phone number.

351
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,270
Sir.

352
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,707
Please try.
- Have some water.

353
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,512
You shouldn't be worried.
It's Valentine's Day.

354
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,443
She must be out with her boyfriend.

355
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,572
There's no way she'll tell you.

356
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,242
What are you saying?

357
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:38,412
Ma'am, kids these
days are just like that.

358
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:40,251
Don't worry... She must
be enjoying herself somewhere.

359
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,416
We deal with such cases every day.
- Sir, please.

360
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,726
You might have dealt
with similar cases before.

361
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,492
But my daughter isn't
like any of them.

362
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:56,263
She called me at 12:30 and
said she's coming home in 45 minutes.

363
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,466
That clearly means
she was coming home!

364
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,209
Look at the time now.

365
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:03,744
It's been 3 hours.

366
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,440
She isn't at her friend's place...

367
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:07,608
...nor at the party,
nor is she answering her phone.

368
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:11,142
In fact, no one knows where she is.
Do you get what I am saying?

369
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:14,553
I need your help.

370
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:19,152
Write down your details in this
register. And your phone number.

371
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,622
As well as the description
of your daughter.

372
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:23,564
Give me your number,
I'll send you her photograph.

373
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,792
Okay.
We'll inform you as soon as we can.

374
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:28,632
You can go home.

375
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:35,202
Hello lndu, just keep trying.

376
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,236
Hello, madam.

377
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,305
I'll call you back, bye.

378
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,581
My name is Dayashankar Kapoor...

379
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,778
...but, you can call me DK in short.

380
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,276
I am a detective.

381
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,511
Private-eye.

382
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,656
Don't mind the Police.

383
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:53,095
Dealing with crime every day,
they have become thick skinned.

384
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:57,631
Let me know If I can be of any
use to you. No need to hesitate.

385
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,169
No thank you.
- How sweet of you.

386
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,636
Here's my card.

387
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,633
Keep this.
It's my official card.

388
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:14,077
I've quite a reputation in Old Delhi.

389
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,210
I am a licensed detective, yeah.

390
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:19,214
By the grace of God just
from the ashes of a man...

391
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,349
...I can deduce his entire life.

392
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,520
You're welcome to try.
Best gadget...

393
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:25,686
Best surveillance.

394
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,087
Hi-tech equipment.

395
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:31,032
I've everything, I guarantee.
- Sir, I need to get home...

396
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,035
...please move.
- No, problem, ma'am.

397
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:36,101
Have faith in the Almighty.
Your daughter will come home.

398
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,503
Everything will be fine.

399
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,032
Your dress.

400
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,164
This way, ma'am.

401
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,204
Excuse me...
- Ma'am.

402
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,712
Mrs. Sabarwal.
- Yes.

403
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,073
Come with me.

404
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:22,744
This side"

405
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,806
Oh, God!

406
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,110
Arya.

407
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,132
Oh, God!

408
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,742
How did this happen?

409
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:24,603
Arya.

410
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:35,452
She's had severe internal injuries.

411
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,357
She is still in a state of shock.

412
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:42,129
And...we might have to do
multiple surgeries later on.

413
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:44,061
Because of internal bleeding..

414
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,363
She is unable to eat.

415
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:49,766
So we will be feeding
her through her Iv.

416
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:58,161
In fact...somebody tried
to strangle her to death.

417
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:02,681
Because of which her
breathing is inconsistent.

418
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:06,111
If she doesn't stabilize soon...
her condition can get critical.

419
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,591
To be honest with you, ma'am...

420
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:14,687
...your daughter has
been physically abused.

421
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:21,126
It's possible that your
daughter has been raped.

422
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,406
Ma'am...

423
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,620
She's a strong girl, ma'am.

424
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,195
Behind me is the very hospital...

425
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,363
...where the assault victim
was admitted a while ago.

426
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:59,675
Sources confirm that
she is in critical condition.

427
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,301
We'll update you as soon
as we've more information.

428
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,676
This is Pankaj Sharma with
cameraman Sahil, Zee News, Delhi.

429
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:14,455
Sir, boss is calling you.

430
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,468
What's the update
on Sansar Singh's case?

431
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,064
Charge sheet's been
already filed, sir.

432
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:36,440
The victim at JP Care Hospital
is no longer an assault case.

433
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,145
It's rape.

434
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,042
Possibly gang-rape-

435
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,209
Go and take over.
- Yes, sir.

436
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,785
Mrs. Sabarwal.

437
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:56,327
Ma'am, please sign here.

438
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,662
Thank you, ma'am.

439
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,367
Mrs. Sabarwal.

440
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:09,072
Matthew Francis, Crime Branch.

441
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:13,139
I'm...extremely sorry
about what has happened.

442
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,341
I want you to know that...

443
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,679
...we've started our investigations.

444
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:23,248
We're interrogating everyone
present at the party.

445
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:27,690
Also...we must record
your daughter's statement...

446
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,030
...whenever she regains consciousness.

447
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,226
I'm sure you understand.

448
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,279
Anand... please come back.

449
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:54,589
We really need you.

450
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:04,032
Please come back.

451
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:11,363
Please!

452
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,242
Arya.

453
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:30,624
Dear...

454
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:07,461
What do you want, dear?

455
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,525
Water? Would you like some water?

456
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,597
Bed...
- Bedpan.

457
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:17,637
You want the bedpan?

458
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,976
Hold on...I'll get it.

459
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,085
Please, dear.

460
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,520
Just one spoon.

461
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:30,238
I am sorry"

462
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,680
Did she say anything?

463
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,459
Tell us something, dear.

464
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:26,092
Who were they?

465
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:31,601
We know...

466
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:41,482
...how hard this is for you.

467
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:47,512
But only you...
can bring them to justice.

468
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,793
If you can...
- Do you know...

469
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:04,766
Do you know what he was screaming?

470
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:21,483
"Now call your mom"

471
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:32,534
I don't remember anything after that.

472
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:38,338
Sir...

473
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:40,639
The girl has given her statement.

474
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:56,689
Get up.

475
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:00,827
Leave my collar
- Come.

476
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:02,756
What have I done?
- Let go.

477
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:04,259
Bro.
- Come quietly. - Leave me.

478
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,629
Where you are taking me?

479
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,600
Come on, You...
- Let go.

480
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,236
What have I done?

481
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:10,464
Where you are taking me?

482
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:13,440
Leave my collar.

483
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:15,542
You will pay for this, inspector.

484
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,669
You will...

485
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,715
Sir, let me go.
- Sir, where you are taking him?

486
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,111
I haven't done anything.
- Where are you taking him?

487
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,549
Sir...
- Sir...

488
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:30,749
Sir... Stop hitting him.

489
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:32,526
Sir...

490
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:36,697
I haven't done anything.

491
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,167
I haven't done anything.
- What has he done?

492
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,669
Let me go.
- Sir, let him go.

493
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,504
We know he's your friend.

494
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:47,565
Say it clearly.
- His name is Jagan Singh.

495
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:02,749
Don't die before I return.

496
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,690
Where are you taking my son?
- I'll be back soon.

497
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,256
Get up...

498
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:08,557
Where are you taking me?
- Come on.

499
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,530
Where are you taking me?
- Come on.

500
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,831
Open the door.
- Take care, Uncle. I'll be back soon.

501
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,561
Get in.
I said get in.

502
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:23,103
I could've done that myself, Tara.

503
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:27,380
Then you should've done it by now.
- Okay...

504
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:29,342
Can I get a cup of tea?

505
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,211
The weather's playing tricks again.

506
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:34,155
No tea for you!

507
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,156
I'll get it.

508
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:42,123
What is English for 'Tara'.
- Star.

509
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:44,495
She's got starry tantrums.

510
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:46,194
'The Valentine Day rape case...'

511
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:47,291
Go back...

512
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,196
...post the victim's statement.

513
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:51,398
This is the gang-rape incident case,
where the victim was...

514
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:53,566
Kidnapped from Zodiac Farms...

515
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,632
No one's safe in this country anymore.

516
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,178
She was found next morning in
critical condition in a drain.

517
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,282
The victim has identified four people
through video conferencing. - Tea.

518
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,146
The case is now under Crime Branch...

519
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:04,548
...which is being lead
by Officer Matthew Francis.

520
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,622
Nothing's ever going
to change in this country.

521
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,217
Why not, mom?

522
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,692
The government will have
to take an action for this.

523
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,388
The people need to wake up.

524
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,362
Listen...you must come
home early from your tuitions.

525
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:20,264
Mom?
- Don't you see what's happening?

526
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:22,030
What are you saying?
- What am I saying?

527
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,163
Why don't you say something?

528
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,441
It always has to be me.
- All four are still in custody.

529
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:31,007
The case has been
forwarded to Fast Track Court...

530
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:34,709
...and the victim has sought permission
to depose through video conference.

531
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:43,606
"...And when they thought
I am dead, they..."

532
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,128
"...threw me...

533
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:57,267
...out of their car."

534
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:05,238
Sir, we seek permission
for their forensic test.

535
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:06,544
Granted.

536
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,107
Thank you, sir.

537
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,486
Arya's injuries are
consistent with her story.

538
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:17,489
I am completely sure
she's telling the truth.

539
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:19,217
And the rest can be proved...

540
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:21,990
...after we receive
the forensic report.

541
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,994
Everyone says that
we'll lose this case...

542
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:26,193
...as soon as the
forensic reports arrive.

543
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,128
Please do something.

544
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:29,731
This is Arya SabarwaPs
blood report...

545
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:31,700
...on the 14th of February.

546
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:35,371
Blood alcohol content is 0.08.

547
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,045
Her statement is not reliable.

548
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,271
I am at the court.
I'll call you back.

549
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,482
Sir, this is the victim's phone.

550
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:49,113
The police recovered
it from the exact same location...

551
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:51,284
...where she claimed
she was kidnapped.

552
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,562
'Sit here, I'll call a cab.'

553
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:56,530
Sir, I was at that
pany from 10 pm to 4 am.

554
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:59,065
Charles and Mohit were with me.

555
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:03,136
They never left.
In fact, she left the party.

556
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,335
These are their phone records.

557
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:07,402
The triangulated positions show...

558
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:11,071
...that Charles was at the party.
And Baburam never left his post.

559
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,815
And Mohit's teacher broke his phone.

560
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:15,339
So...

561
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,743
The traffic signal cameras...
- Sir, verification.

562
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,385
It's verified.
- Thank you, sir.

563
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:23,384
Sir, we've recovered
footages of the car...

564
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,289
between the
farmhouse and the drain.

565
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:29,328
It's Charles Deewan's car, which
the victim mentioned in her statement.

566
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:32,263
Sir...the car was completely washed.

567
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:34,567
No prints, no fluids.

568
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,243
You two go back to the party.
And you, back to your post.

569
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,247
I'll go wash the car.
- Okay.

570
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:47,540
I was driving the car.

571
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:56,071
I borrowed the car from dude...
I mean, from my friend Charles...

572
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,054
...since it was Valentines Day...

573
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:02,757
...and I wanted to take
my girlfriend for a ride.

574
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:07,366
Sir, his phone's location
proves that he was in the car.

575
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:09,333
With his girlfriend, of course.

576
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:17,302
I called the police
immediately after I found her.

577
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,547
But I thought it was better
to take her to the nearest hospital...

578
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,709
...instead of waiting for the police.

579
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:26,420
Note down...victim was found
where she claims she was thrown.

580
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:30,049
Before I left,
Mohit was misbehaving with Arya.

581
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:33,523
By the time I got back,
Sapna was quite dizzy...

582
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:36,030
...and Arya's phone was unreachable.

583
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,994
After that, I dropped Sapna home.

584
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:43,527
And finally,
Baburam has confessed to the police...

585
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,437
Objection. inadmissible.

586
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:48,200
Sustained. Don't waste my time.

587
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:54,416
Don't you think your friend
Arya left with her boyfriend?

588
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:56,280
They had sex.
They had an argument...

589
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,013
He beat her up.
- Objection! Character assassination.

590
00:47:58,075 --> 00:47:59,418
But unfortunately in our society...

591
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:02,319
...we cannot openly admit to affairs.
- Objection, sir.

592
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,188
So she blamed it on someone else.
- Sustained.

593
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:05,383
Stop this rubbish!

594
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:07,252
Show some sensitivity.

595
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,220
Sorry, sir.

596
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:20,307
Did you see Mohit when
you arrived at the party?

597
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:30,515
Yes.

598
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:33,017
And Baburam even
opened the gate for you?

599
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:38,126
'I'm here to pick up my daughter.'

600
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:42,758
Say it louder.

601
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,392
Yes, but...

602
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:49,102
I got there at around 2 am.

603
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:53,140
But my daughter Arya
was missing since 12:30 am.

604
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,601
So you admit that
they were at the party...

605
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,269
...but your daughter wasn't.

606
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:00,272
Objection, leading the witness.

607
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:01,515
Denied.

608
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:08,682
What's all this nonsense in the court?

609
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,115
According to the
Supreme Court's maxim...

610
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:13,388
...the victim's statement
is enough for a conviction...

611
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,690
...even I know that.

612
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,163
But this maxim is based on the fact...

613
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,598
...that people can lie,
circumstances cannot.

614
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:29,142
Shall we, dear.

615
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,747
You've been discharged.

616
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:36,082
Shall we go home?

617
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:43,152
Arya and Devki ma'am
always had a problem with me.

618
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:44,687
So it's quite obvious
they took my name.

619
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,723
And why will I do it, sir?
I am in love with Arya.

620
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:51,123
If I had been there that day...

621
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:53,462
...I would've never spared those guys.

622
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:56,400
Will you please introduce yourself?

623
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,632
I am Dr. Mohit Bhatt.

624
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:00,266
I'm a Grade 1 Senior
Scientific Officer...

625
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:02,366
...at the Central Forensic Laboratory.

626
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:05,310
Did you prepare this report?
- I did.

627
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:07,105
What's written in it?

628
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,315
The report is negative.

629
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:13,443
The accused's forensic samples...

630
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:17,650
...and the samples collected
from Arya's body do not match.

631
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:19,253
How is this possible?

632
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,752
Arya gave her statement 3 days later.

633
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:25,260
The swabs were collected
after 72 hours.

634
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,364
The sperms were destroyed by then.

635
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:29,537
But don't worry, we'll apply again.

636
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:31,504
This time it will be positive.

637
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:43,471
It's really unfortunate
that the prosecutrix was raped.

638
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,672
She has sustained severe
wounds on her body.

639
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:50,380
And there was an attempt
to kill her as well.

640
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:54,153
Since she was under
the influence of alcohol...

641
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:58,290
...on the night of 14th February,
her statement cannot be relied on.

642
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:03,162
Even the Prosecution has
failed to corroborate her statement.

643
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:05,564
The court believes that...

644
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,795
...even if thousands
of guilty go free...

645
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:11,306
...not a single innocent
soul should be punished.

646
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:15,635
It cannot be proven without a doubt...

647
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,579
...that Charles Deewan,
Mohit Chadha, Baburam Pande...

648
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:24,416
...and Joginder Singh
committed the rape.

649
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:27,621
And so the court acquits them.

650
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:32,593
Jagan...
- Dude.

651
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:36,063
What an amazing lawyer.

652
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,431
Leave me.

653
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,437
Take him out of the court.

654
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:46,337
Arrest him! This is contempt of court.
- Shut up!

655
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:55,583
Anand, what happened?
- Devki, this is really unfair.

656
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:57,141
Where are you taking him?

657
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,351
Hold on...
- This is not justice.

658
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:00,581
Waitmwhere are you taking him?

659
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:03,124
Anand!
- Ma'am please...

660
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:05,385
Anand!
- Devki.

661
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:06,620
Wait madam, please.

662
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:08,695
Anand!

663
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:15,665
Thank you, sir.

664
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:18,365
The court acquitted everyone.
- I can't believe it.

665
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:20,506
Sir punched Jagan in a fit of rage...

666
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:23,636
...and he was arrested
for contempt of court.

667
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:27,144
But don't worry ma'am,
we'll get him out.

668
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:41,153
He's here.

669
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:44,629
Sir, sign here.

670
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:01,809
I am so sorry about what has happened?

671
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:04,583
I can understand what
you'll are going through.

672
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:06,677
There's no way you can understand.

673
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:11,519
You can get away with
rape in this country...

674
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:14,693
...but you can't even slap a rapist.

675
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,700
The Police never discriminates.

676
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:22,500
Anyone who breaks the law is our enemy.
- Please...

677
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,402
I've no more expectations.

678
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:28,669
Not from the Police...

679
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,506
...nor the law.

680
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:49,729
Yeah, lndu.

681
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,734
Please open the door.
- What happened?

682
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:57,727
Arya saw her verdict on

683
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:01,437
...and locked herself inside.
- What was everyone doing?

684
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:02,738
Why did you leave her alone?
- Open the door.

685
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,745
I couldn't do anything.
- Open the door.

686
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,747
Arya...
- Arya, please.

687
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:08,646
Arya...

688
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:11,584
Arya, please.
- Arya, open the door.

689
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:14,449
Arya!
- Oh, God!

690
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,738
Arya.

691
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:41,547
Calm down.

692
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,076
Arya.

693
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:45,781
Indu, take her away.

694
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:47,282
Mom.

695
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:49,748
Arya.

696
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:54,093
Calm down, dear.
Arya...

697
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:57,265
No, Arya.

698
00:55:58,722 --> 00:55:59,792
Calm down.
Arya.

699
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:01,735
Arya.

700
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:05,603
Calm down, dear.
Arya...

701
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,074
Calm down, dear.

702
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:13,036
Calm down.

703
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:15,639
Calm down, dear.

704
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:21,250
Calm down.

705
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:24,459
Calm down, dear.

706
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:45,598
She's asleep.

707
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:51,337
We can't give up, Devki.

708
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:56,016
We must fight.

709
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:59,250
We'll appeal to the High Court.

710
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:02,746
They will be hanged to death.

711
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:05,083
They will pay for this.

712
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:11,165
Arya's the one paying the price.

713
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:17,736
Living with this incident...

714
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:23,210
Nothing can be worse than that.

715
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,044
I always believed...

716
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:35,116
...everything will be eventually
fine between Arya and me.

717
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:39,389
But now it's all over.

718
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:48,094
She has gone so far...

719
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:51,364
...and coming back is...

720
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:55,402
I've lost her.

721
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:01,741
I've lost her, Anand.

722
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:38,111
You awake, dear.

723
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,188
I've decided that...

724
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:48,761
...we should go out somewhere.

725
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:58,133
How about that place you suggested?

726
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:03,400
It's alright.

727
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:06,309
But do let me know...

728
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,041
...once you change your mind.

729
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:22,188
When will sis come back to school?

730
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:24,031
Soon.

731
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,202
Stop bothering me, Mohit.

732
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,674
Your brother just got back.
- Bye, morn.

733
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:38,441
How many months into
pregnancy you have been?

734
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,755
How can you allow him back in school?
- The court's acquitted him.

735
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:50,820
He's innocent by law.

736
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:56,588
So you're saying that
my daughter's lying?

737
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:58,494
That's not what I meant.

738
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:01,257
But I can't take
any action against him.

739
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:05,136
What excuse can I
give for expelling him?

740
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,275
"That the court didn't
believe Arya..."

741
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,745
"...but we do?"

742
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:17,248
So you won't do anything.

743
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:21,279
His parents will sue the school.

744
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:41,236
Morning, ma'am.
- Morning...

745
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:01,356
Stop calling me all the time.?

746
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:04,295
Tell brother I am coming...coming
towards him only.

747
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:06,761
I had to bunk lectures because of you.

748
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:08,825
Now hang up, stop bothering me.

749
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:50,368
A lawyer like Bansal will
definitely benefit our case.

750
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:51,698
Go for it.

751
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:02,371
I'll call you later.

752
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:13,317
Devki, what happened
to the car... - It's nothing.

753
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:14,417
Just a small accident.

754
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:16,292
Accident? Are you okay?

755
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:17,557
Yeah, I am fine.

756
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,257
No wonder you're so late.

757
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:22,428
Indu also had to leave.
- Anand...

758
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,231
I cannot teach at
that school any longer.

759
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:29,674
And we'll shift Priya
to another school.

760
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:32,337
What happened?

761
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:34,370
He's back in school.

762
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:37,207
Who?

763
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:44,680
Mohit?

764
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:58,754
I suggest you find someone else.

765
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:01,163
He's not a nice guy.

766
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:03,697
What are you saying, DK sir?
- Exactly.

767
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:07,174
I wonder if my daughter
will ever get married?

768
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:09,273
I know of a guy.

769
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:11,610
Fresh in the market.

770
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:15,342
He'll be absolutely
right for your daughter.

771
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,176
Look...

772
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:20,315
Tell me something, DK sir.

773
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,986
Are you a detective or a matchmaker?

774
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:25,992
Just your well-wisher, Mr. Bagga.

775
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,331
Wait here.

776
01:06:33,522 --> 01:06:35,695
Where to?
- Just check his profile.

777
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,301
Madam, where are you going?

778
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:41,769
Come in.

779
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:44,476
I came here by mistake.

780
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:46,410
You're holding my visiting card...

781
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:48,574
...and you claim to
have come by mistake.

782
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:52,545
How can I be of service?

783
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:57,180
I know everything about your case.

784
01:06:57,747 --> 01:06:59,158
The court didn't
just make a mistake...

785
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:00,558
They have sinned.

786
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:05,265
I can feel what you're feeling.

787
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:11,528
No one knows what I am feeling.

788
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:19,612
I may not be a good enough
detective to deduce feelings...

789
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,016
...but I am a father nevertheless.

790
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:27,281
I have a daughter...she's
the same age as your daughter.

791
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:29,456
Look at this, it's very beautiful.

792
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:32,015
Thankfully she's
taken after her mother.

793
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:38,491
I can imagine what you're feeling.

794
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:43,100
But don't worry, I am a professional.

795
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:47,531
Client secrecy is my top priority.

796
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:49,775
Swear on God.

797
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:55,346
'Up-

798
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,684
I want information.

799
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:04,550
Done.

800
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:07,522
You'll get the information.
But...

801
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:10,327
From this moment onwards,
I don't know you...

802
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:12,563
...and you don't know me.

803
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:39,426
Welcome to Rajiv Chowk Metro Station.

804
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:42,061
Please stand clear of the door.

805
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:43,385
Thank you.

806
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:02,479
Monday nights Baburam
gets off early from work.

807
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:06,008
Every Monday night...

808
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:10,685
...he sits at the same bar
and drinks till it shuts down.

809
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:16,286
I don't know whether what
I am doing is right or wrong.

810
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:17,556
It's wrong.

811
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:22,732
But doing nothing isn't right either.

812
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:29,568
If you've to choose
between wrong and not right...

813
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:32,578
...then what will you choose?

814
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:45,352
The address of the bar.

815
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,693
Is the information a 100 percent?

816
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,392
Have faith in God.

817
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:54,635
He'll fix everything.

818
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:02,498
God can't be everywhere, Mr. DK.

819
01:10:05,334 --> 01:10:06,472
I know.

820
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:09,145
That's why he created Mothers.

821
01:11:25,347 --> 01:11:28,521
It takes only one lifetime
to be born as a woman.

822
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:33,225
But only after one thousand
and eighteen rebirths...

823
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:36,326
...does one get the privilege
of being born as a man.

824
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:37,629
Drunkard

825
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:39,698
Rubbish!

826
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:42,774
What?
- You're talking rubbish.

827
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:44,435
You've lost your mind.

828
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,673
Get lost.
- " Lipstick..."

829
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:21,572
"Your waist... looks voluptuous."

830
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:36,723
"Your waist... looks voluptuous."

831
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:40,890
Don't be shy.

832
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:43,668
Show me your face.

833
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:22,441
<i>Rama...
- Why are you screaming?</i>

834
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:23,908
Where were you the last three days?

835
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:26,640
Why didn't you come home?
I am asking you something.

836
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:28,277
Who were you sleeping with?

837
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:29,280
Are you going to answer me?

838
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:30,975
Where had you gone?

839
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:33,577
I want to know...
- Shut up!

840
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:37,516
Why did you come back?

841
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:38,853
I even called at your office.

842
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:41,394
You haven't even been
to work for last four days!

843
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:44,557
I had made up my mind
to go to the police.

844
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:48,564
Why marry me if this
is what you wanted to do?

845
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:06,885
Why are you screaming?
I can scream too, you know.

846
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:13,884
What are you smashing in there?

847
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:16,429
Is that all you can do?

848
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:18,964
It's my bad luck.

849
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:29,810
"She called you four times..."

850
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:31,674
"...but you didn't reply."

851
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:33,610
"And also..."

852
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:38,510
'He was the same security
guard who was recently arrested...'

853
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:40,713
'...in connection
to a gang-rape case.'

854
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,324
Piyu!
- Coming, mom.

855
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:06,278
'Security Guard Baburam
was acquitted...'

856
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:07,905
'...from the Valentine Day rape case.'

857
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:11,474
'He was found dead in his house,
in castrated condition.'

858
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:14,982
'According to sources,
he was missing for four days...'

859
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:20,454
'...and he was last seen on
Monday night at Vishwakarma bar.'

860
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:23,760
Some neighbors saw him
lying outside his house...

861
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:23,521
This is definitely revenge.

862
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:29,291
No, sir. They are decent people.

863
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:33,665
Really?
- Yes sir.

864
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:44,233
How can I help you?

865
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,744
You must have heard
what happened with Baburam.

866
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:50,211
He deserved whatever happened to him.

867
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:56,685
The problem is, Mr. Anand,
that this is no coincidence...

868
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:57,780
it was deliberate.

869
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:01,792
The question is who...
- I wish it was me.

870
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:09,395
My deputy Rashid, even he
believes this is revenge-killing.

871
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:14,729
But I said...it can't be you.
You're decent people.

872
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:18,001
Decent... but not stupid.

873
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:24,413
You're suspecting me?

874
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:28,381
You think I did it?

875
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:32,658
I think a man's capable
of doing anything when he's angry.

876
01:17:34,182 --> 01:17:37,789
Yes...l am angry.
But I still have faith.

877
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:40,628
That we will get justice.

878
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:43,732
Nice to hear that.

879
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:46,895
See you...

880
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:49,937
Sorry for bothering you.

881
01:17:54,603 --> 01:17:56,207
Keep an eye on him.
- Yes sir.

882
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:06,926
This is his new series.

883
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:08,895
It's an interesting take.

884
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:12,798
We're in a gallery,
Take off your sunglasses.

885
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:14,990
People will laugh at you.

886
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:19,405
I never leave home without
my mother's blessings...

887
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:21,997
...and my sunglasses.

888
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:35,314
Did you get the information
I asked for?

889
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:47,325
This must belong to an elephant.

890
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:49,763
It's a pen-drive.

891
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:21,333
I've already Whatsapped
you the procedure...

892
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:23,596
...for disabling CCTV.
You can go through it later.

893
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:32,576
Leave five minutes after I do.

894
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:36,775
Stay here for a while
and appreciate this painting.

895
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:42,513
What is this painting about?

896
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:51,491
It's when Draupadi washed
her tresses with Dushashan's blood.

897
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,835
Look around you.

898
01:19:56,691 --> 01:20:00,503
This artist's theme is 'Mahabharata'.

899
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:04,841
The oldest revenge story.

900
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:08,379
Where is Draupadi?

901
01:20:21,616 --> 01:20:22,924
It's modern art.

902
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:34,506
"Come out of this painting...'

903
01:20:34,796 --> 01:20:35,774
I could've made this painting...

904
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:37,708
...with my hands tied behind my back.

905
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:39,674
Unbelievable.
If you get it, it's art.

906
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:41,543
If you don't, it's modern art.

907
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:43,514
Excuse me.
- Yes, sir. How can I help you?

908
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:45,483
How much for this red canvas?

909
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:46,914
5 million.

910
01:20:46,975 --> 01:20:49,979
5...million?
- Yes, sir. It's already sold out.

911
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:53,254
Did you receive payment?
- Yes.

912
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:57,989
Draupadi.

913
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:03,801
'Charles Diwan.'

914
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:07,536
'The only son of an Indian
father and British mother.'

915
01:21:07,896 --> 01:21:09,273
'His parents are no more...'

916
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:12,269
'...but they left everything for him.'

917
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:15,445
He live all alone in Greater Noida...

918
01:21:15,503 --> 01:21:17,744
...Green Field society, bungalow 11

919
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:20,013
He's a partner in a nightclub.

920
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:24,288
'And every Saturday night
he parties at that club.'

921
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:29,457
'Even his servant takes
an off on Saturday night...'

922
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:30,996
'...and, returns on Sunday morning.'

923
01:21:34,956 --> 01:21:38,870
'And his cousin,
Mohit Chadha, pet name Bunty.'

924
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,965
'Both his parents are pilots,
and they often travel.'

925
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:47,236
'So he spends most of his
time with his cousin Charles.'

926
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:50,741
'Both of them are very
frequent in each other's home.'

927
01:21:50,805 --> 01:21:54,617
'By the way, Charles always has a
spare key to Mohit's house in his home.'

928
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:57,622
'Charles Diwan is a fitness freak.'

929
01:21:57,946 --> 01:22:02,417
'From whey protein to creatine,
he takes every supplement.'

930
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:06,591
'Let me know if there's
any other information you want.'

931
01:22:06,888 --> 01:22:08,697
'Well then...'

932
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:09,599
-okay-'

933
01:22:40,755 --> 01:22:41,927
So what's the problem?

934
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:45,271
Can't you get a single
date for an appeal?

935
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:49,839
I don't think you're interested
in this case any longer.

936
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,274
Hold on.

937
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:55,279
Where are you going?
- We're out of groceries.

938
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:57,241
I'll be late.

939
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,346
Also, need to see the tailor...

940
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:01,785
I don't care if there
are other cases pending.

941
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:04,579
Now don't give me excuses, please.

942
01:23:04,779 --> 01:23:06,383
He's still at home.

943
01:23:07,248 --> 01:23:08,818
Do not lose sight of him, Rashid.

944
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:10,658
No chance, sir.

945
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,560
I haven't gone home
for 3 days myself.

946
01:23:12,954 --> 01:23:14,558
I think he's very decent.

947
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:16,366
It's been <i>6</i> days.

948
01:23:16,558 --> 01:23:19,471
Home to office,
Office to home...that's all he does.

949
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,732
He never even jumps a signal,
even at night.

950
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:23,832
He's a law abiding citizen.
- I asked you to keep an eye...

951
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:27,977
...and not for your opinion.
- Sorry sir.

952
01:23:57,532 --> 01:23:59,534
Can you open it?
- Yes, madam.

953
01:24:10,512 --> 01:24:11,889
The gardener...

954
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:18,824
I've told him a thousand
times not to leave it here.

955
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:22,399
The children can trip over.

956
01:24:31,433 --> 01:24:32,639
It's open.

957
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,509
Come on...come on...
- Here you go.

958
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:36,310
The children will be home soon.

959
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:40,275
Keep this money.

960
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:41,445
Let's go...let's go..

961
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:43,545
It's okay, madam.

962
01:24:43,945 --> 01:24:44,889
Here you go, mister.

963
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:46,481
Thank you.

964
01:28:54,195 --> 01:28:54,502
Sir.

965
01:29:00,568 --> 01:29:01,638
Hello?

966
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:03,778
Who is this?

967
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:07,611
What happened to bro?

968
01:29:09,544 --> 01:29:10,579
Huh!

969
01:29:11,913 --> 01:29:13,324
Which hospital?

970
01:29:38,406 --> 01:29:39,817
Where to madam?

971
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:45,250
Hello...
yes, I'm just downstairs.

972
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:46,689
Coming UP-

973
01:29:46,748 --> 01:29:48,728
Where are you going, madam?

974
01:29:48,783 --> 01:29:49,853
Yes...

975
01:29:51,352 --> 01:29:52,763
What?
- Who do you want to meet?

976
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:54,731
Mukesh Chabbra, 20-C.

977
01:29:54,789 --> 01:29:56,291
I see...
- I'm coming.

978
01:29:56,357 --> 01:29:57,961
Madam, your name?
- Mrs. Mathur.

979
01:29:58,226 --> 01:29:59,261
Fine, go.
- Thank you.

980
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:13,750
What's wrong with him?

981
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:15,513
It's a case of poisoning, sir.

982
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:18,847
I never took my eyes off him, sir.

983
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:21,960
What's the poison?

984
01:30:28,723 --> 01:30:29,793
It's cyanide, sir.

985
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:33,904
Made from apple seeds.
- Apple seeds?

986
01:30:34,362 --> 01:30:35,841
Wait!

987
01:30:36,697 --> 01:30:39,507
Reports say that Apple
seeds contain cyanide.

988
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:42,407
It only takes 1.5 g to kill a human.

989
01:30:42,537 --> 01:30:45,245
And apple seeds contain 0.6 mg

990
01:30:46,474 --> 01:30:47,919
At the moment he's paralyzed.

991
01:30:48,543 --> 01:30:50,580
But the doctors are astonished
about how he survived?

992
01:30:51,312 --> 01:30:52,484
Wait.

993
01:30:55,349 --> 01:30:58,853
We've found traces of
protein shake and apple seeds...

994
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:00,695
...from his mouth and food pipe.

995
01:31:00,822 --> 01:31:02,699
Bro.
- Is that what he ate last?

996
01:31:02,757 --> 01:31:03,735
Yes, sir, that's what he ate.

997
01:31:03,825 --> 01:31:05,463
And we've also collected
evidence from his home.

998
01:31:05,526 --> 01:31:07,028
Who did this to you, bro?

999
01:31:11,499 --> 01:31:13,843
And...
- It's not the father.

1000
01:31:14,268 --> 01:31:15,941
I think someone else is involved.

1001
01:31:18,506 --> 01:31:19,883
I want to know.

1002
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:22,378
He cannot speak.

1003
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:23,547
N ow!

1004
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:40,533
Hello.

1005
01:31:41,762 --> 01:31:42,866
Yeah.

1006
01:31:44,232 --> 01:31:45,370
What? Fire?

1007
01:31:49,737 --> 01:31:51,717
You should've checked first.
- Even I heard the alarm, sir.

1008
01:31:51,772 --> 01:31:53,376
Look the police are here.

1009
01:31:55,243 --> 01:31:56,688
What's wrong?
- It was a false alarm, sir.

1010
01:31:56,777 --> 01:31:59,280
We checked the entire building.
There's no fire anywhere.

1011
01:32:01,282 --> 01:32:03,888
That was a close shave, mister.

1012
01:32:04,418 --> 01:32:06,625
Mom and dad would've killed me.

1013
01:32:07,889 --> 01:32:09,766
You can go. There's no fire, sir.

1014
01:32:09,957 --> 01:32:12,528
We'll put it out
even if there isn't one.

1015
01:32:12,727 --> 01:32:13,797
Let's go upstairs.

1016
01:32:15,897 --> 01:32:17,467
Rashid.
- Yes, sir.

1017
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:20,672
Find out...what set off the alarm.
- Okay, sir.

1018
01:32:21,769 --> 01:32:22,770
Check everything.

1019
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:23,871
Bedroom and kitchen too

1020
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:25,609
You wasted your time once before...

1021
01:32:25,673 --> 01:32:26,811
...and you're doing it again.

1022
01:32:27,408 --> 01:32:28,716
What do you think
you're looking for, sir?

1023
01:32:29,443 --> 01:32:31,582
I said it's a false alarm.
Are you looking for buried treasure?

1024
01:32:32,313 --> 01:32:34,919
Go find the one who poisoned
my brother... - Shut up!

1025
01:32:35,883 --> 01:32:38,295
Otherwise,
I'll throw you out of the window.

1026
01:32:41,923 --> 01:32:42,765
It's just the bathroom.

1027
01:32:43,691 --> 01:32:45,364
Nature calls the police too.

1028
01:32:51,699 --> 01:32:52,905
So this is what was going on here.

1029
01:32:53,968 --> 01:32:56,642
Search properly, Rashid.
I want all his drugs in front of me.

1030
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,910
Sir, this isn't mine.

1031
01:32:57,972 --> 01:32:59,576
My dad sometimes...

1032
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,586
Sir, look.
- Sorry sir.

1033
01:33:17,758 --> 01:33:19,431
Honestly, sir, this isn't mine.

1034
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:34,712
Where did it come from?

1035
01:33:35,676 --> 01:33:37,349
This is where the
cyanide was prepared.

1036
01:33:58,799 --> 01:34:00,301
Cooked enough to kill an elephant.

1037
01:34:00,668 --> 01:34:01,942
What are you saying?

1038
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:04,339
Where were you last night?

1039
01:34:06,374 --> 01:34:07,648
At home, sir.

1040
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:10,851
Isn't this your laptop?

1041
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:12,549
Look at this, sir.

1042
01:34:21,822 --> 01:34:23,699
Jesus Christ.

1043
01:34:24,792 --> 01:34:27,773
He researched last night.
- Yes.

1044
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:39,775
Son of a gun...it's been ages
since we had such a solid case.

1045
01:34:41,308 --> 01:34:43,686
Take all this into evidence.
- Yes, sir.

1046
01:34:49,817 --> 01:34:51,353
Arrest the bas***

1047
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:52,623
Come on.

1048
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,924
Hold on... wait...
What for?

1049
01:34:55,456 --> 01:34:56,594
Attempt to Murder.

1050
01:34:57,324 --> 01:35:00,703
He's my brother.
Why would I murder him?

1051
01:35:01,395 --> 01:35:02,305
Maybe you were scared...

1052
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:04,343
...that one of you might
turn approver. Come on.

1053
01:35:04,899 --> 01:35:06,742
Please.
- Come on.

1054
01:35:06,801 --> 01:35:10,339
You know I haven't done anything.
- Come on!

1055
01:36:25,813 --> 01:36:26,814
Arya.

1056
01:36:30,684 --> 01:36:33,255
Arya dear, are you okay?

1057
01:36:53,574 --> 01:36:54,712
Dear...

1058
01:37:25,306 --> 01:37:26,512
Sorry.

1059
01:37:44,892 --> 01:37:47,771
He was my best student.

1060
01:37:52,433 --> 01:37:55,380
How did this happen, Charles?

1061
01:38:01,442 --> 01:38:02,944
How did it happen?

1062
01:38:16,657 --> 01:38:19,934
What happened to my
daughter that night...

1063
01:38:24,398 --> 01:38:26,378
happens every night.

1064
01:38:28,836 --> 01:38:33,808
After today, even you will never
forget that night.

1065
01:38:38,879 --> 01:38:41,553
You will think about
that night every day...

1066
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:45,889
And regret it.

1067
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,463
What were you guys
screaming that night?

1068
01:38:59,566 --> 01:39:01,978
"CALL YOU R MOM?"

1069
01:39:07,808 --> 01:39:09,583
Here's her mom.

1070
01:39:26,794 --> 01:39:28,205
What happened to him?

1071
01:39:30,698 --> 01:39:33,804
Poor boy got emotional seeing me.
- What happened? Are you okay?

1072
01:39:37,671 --> 01:39:40,481
See you.
Get well soon, Charles.

1073
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:30,898
Yes, the meeting's on schedule.

1074
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:33,463
Of course, of course.

1075
01:40:34,495 --> 01:40:36,406
Vinay, please be there on time.

1076
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:38,472
I'm sitting in the car.

1077
01:40:39,266 --> 01:40:40,404
15 minutes.

1078
01:41:38,459 --> 01:41:39,870
Bye, mom.
- Bye.

1079
01:41:57,878 --> 01:42:00,415
Hello, Mrs. Devki. How are you?

1080
01:42:01,682 --> 01:42:04,561
What brings you here, at the school?

1081
01:42:05,486 --> 01:42:06,931
Is everything okay?

1082
01:42:07,921 --> 01:42:10,697
Of course.
I just came to see you.

1083
01:42:12,526 --> 01:42:13,903
What do you want?

1084
01:42:14,828 --> 01:42:16,501
I need your signature.

1085
01:42:17,865 --> 01:42:18,900
What for?

1086
01:42:19,466 --> 01:42:24,882
Well...the forensic lab wants
to dispose off Arya's samples.

1087
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:28,620
If you want to get them
examined by your own doctors...

1088
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:31,350
Then this is your last chance.

1089
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:34,652
Dispose them.

1090
01:42:37,651 --> 01:42:41,929
L...need you to sign this.

1091
01:42:42,823 --> 01:42:43,824
Sure.

1092
01:42:46,693 --> 01:42:48,536
Sorry.

1093
01:42:49,897 --> 01:42:51,376
<i>Just one second.</i>

1094
01:42:54,935 --> 01:42:58,348
Are you...looking for this?

1095
01:43:04,745 --> 01:43:06,315
Do you...

1096
01:43:08,549 --> 01:43:11,325
...wear the same kind of glasses?

1097
01:43:12,319 --> 01:43:13,491
No...

1098
01:43:14,922 --> 01:43:17,596
I can see everything clearly.

1099
01:43:33,707 --> 01:43:36,415
Here... your pen.

1100
01:43:42,683 --> 01:43:45,527
The fourth guy, Jagan Singh.

1101
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,390
He's Criminal class.

1102
01:43:48,655 --> 01:43:49,759
He's dangerous.

1103
01:43:50,324 --> 01:43:51,530
If I had two daughters...

1104
01:43:51,625 --> 01:43:53,332
...I would've never gone after him.

1105
01:43:55,262 --> 01:43:56,707
Why are you telling me?

1106
01:43:57,531 --> 01:43:58,839
Because he's the only one left.

1107
01:43:59,933 --> 01:44:03,813
Believe it or not, but when
the court acquits guilty people...

1108
01:44:03,937 --> 01:44:05,712
...it makes me really angry.

1109
01:44:06,773 --> 01:44:08,252
I believe you.

1110
01:44:08,742 --> 01:44:10,278
Then believe this too.

1111
01:44:11,411 --> 01:44:14,688
When someone does my work for me...

1112
01:44:15,882 --> 01:44:17,793
...that makes me very angry too.

1113
01:44:20,487 --> 01:44:23,593
I must go...l am getting late.
- You can go, Mrs. Devki.

1114
01:44:24,391 --> 01:44:28,635
But the moment I find evidence,
I will take you along.

1115
01:44:29,329 --> 01:44:30,467
Excuse me.

1116
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:40,274
What's wrong?

1117
01:44:40,641 --> 01:44:41,779
You can't believe it either, right?

1118
01:44:42,809 --> 01:44:44,345
Charles can die anytime...

1119
01:44:44,411 --> 01:44:46,982
...and then Mohit will
be charged with murder.

1120
01:44:47,881 --> 01:44:49,622
Does Arya know?

1121
01:44:50,784 --> 01:44:52,593
I don't know.

1122
01:44:52,753 --> 01:44:55,859
But she told me that
she wants to go for a holiday.

1123
01:44:57,524 --> 01:44:58,935
That's really great.

1124
01:44:59,726 --> 01:45:01,262
Read the whole thing.

1125
01:45:02,763 --> 01:45:05,539
Lots of work to do.
Bookings are to be done.

1126
01:45:05,766 --> 01:45:07,245
I'll get to work, okay.

1127
01:45:09,469 --> 01:45:10,743
Anand.
- Yeah.

1128
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:17,516
There's something I want to share...
- You are worried about Arya?

1129
01:45:18,879 --> 01:45:19,949
She's recovering.

1130
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:21,788
Everything's getting back to normal.

1131
01:45:22,449 --> 01:45:25,225
We're going to have the
best family vacation ever.

1132
01:45:25,485 --> 01:45:28,329
I am so excited, so happy.

1133
01:45:28,555 --> 01:45:29,590
But l...

1134
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:32,960
This is a new beginning.

1135
01:45:34,194 --> 01:45:35,798
It's what we've been waiting for.

1136
01:45:59,419 --> 01:46:00,523
"In this world..."

1137
01:46:01,621 --> 01:46:07,936
"...people...get deceived."

1138
01:46:10,831 --> 01:46:12,538
You sing really well.

1139
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:19,314
I always wanted to
be a singer like my mother.

1140
01:46:20,507 --> 01:46:22,851
Was she a singer too?
- No

1141
01:46:24,911 --> 01:46:26,720
She also wanted to be one.

1142
01:46:32,519 --> 01:46:33,896
Let's get to the point.

1143
01:46:37,290 --> 01:46:40,567
It'll take some time.
Jagan is missing.

1144
01:46:40,861 --> 01:46:42,204
I even visited his hometown.

1145
01:46:42,696 --> 01:46:46,576
His father passed away,
but he didn't show up.

1146
01:46:48,869 --> 01:46:50,906
The police are getting suspicious.

1147
01:46:51,838 --> 01:46:53,784
Please hurry up.

1148
01:46:56,276 --> 01:46:58,654
By the time you return
from your vacations...

1149
01:46:58,845 --> 01:47:01,758
...you'll have all
the details about Jagan.

1150
01:47:01,915 --> 01:47:03,986
With the grace of God,
everything will be fine.

1151
01:47:04,251 --> 01:47:05,628
I have my resources.

1152
01:47:16,496 --> 01:47:17,600
Mr. DK.

1153
01:47:20,834 --> 01:47:21,812
Thank you.

1154
01:47:25,839 --> 01:47:26,874
Thank you.

1155
01:47:50,597 --> 01:47:51,735
Hail Bhole...

1156
01:47:52,265 --> 01:47:53,903
I've resources... setting.

1157
01:47:58,538 --> 01:48:00,643
Hail Bhole...
- Hail Bhole...

1158
01:48:02,642 --> 01:48:03,848
Do you know who I am?

1159
01:48:06,379 --> 01:48:07,881
Who doesn't know you, sir?

1160
01:48:09,449 --> 01:48:10,757
How about a cup of tea?

1161
01:48:14,254 --> 01:48:16,928
No, sir. I've acidity.

1162
01:48:17,924 --> 01:48:18,925
Acidity?

1163
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:21,965
The tea served in my
station is quite sweet.

1164
01:48:23,697 --> 01:48:25,335
I've also got high sugar.

1165
01:48:25,799 --> 01:48:27,836
Really?
- Yes, sir.

1166
01:48:29,636 --> 01:48:32,276
Then how about some black coffee?

1167
01:48:37,477 --> 01:48:40,390
Then...let's have some tea only.

1168
01:48:40,881 --> 01:48:41,916
That's more like it.

1169
01:48:56,429 --> 01:48:58,238
What are you two planning?

1170
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:01,210
Who, sir?

1171
01:49:15,882 --> 01:49:17,293
Speak up.

1172
01:49:18,351 --> 01:49:19,989
What was your plan?

1173
01:49:21,588 --> 01:49:25,661
Because what you're
doing is not the solution.

1174
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:32,604
I'm saying this for your own good.

1175
01:49:33,667 --> 01:49:35,408
What were you telling Devki?

1176
01:49:36,469 --> 01:49:37,539
Devki who?

1177
01:49:38,305 --> 01:49:42,685
I don't know any Devki, sir.
Swear on Almighty.

1178
01:49:47,180 --> 01:49:50,184
Rashid, get the stick.

1179
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:51,661
Stick?
- Sir.

1180
01:49:52,552 --> 01:49:53,758
What for?

1181
01:49:54,387 --> 01:49:55,923
What have I done to deserve a stick?

1182
01:49:56,556 --> 01:49:57,728
<i>Who is this, Mathew'?</i>

1183
01:49:58,325 --> 01:49:59,429
Rathore sir!

1184
01:49:59,826 --> 01:50:01,396
Myself Daya Shankar Kapoor...

1185
01:50:01,428 --> 01:50:03,203
...but, you can call me DK in short.

1186
01:50:03,396 --> 01:50:05,342
I am the best detective
in Dariyaganj area.

1187
01:50:05,365 --> 01:50:06,400
Enlighten him.

1188
01:50:06,633 --> 01:50:09,239
Sir, we're investigating
the gang-rape case.

1189
01:50:09,903 --> 01:50:11,246
How is he connected?

1190
01:50:11,638 --> 01:50:13,618
I've seen him with Mrs. Devki.

1191
01:50:14,207 --> 01:50:16,949
These two are definitely
planning something... - Devki?

1192
01:50:18,244 --> 01:50:19,382
The victim's mother?

1193
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:21,724
Yes, sir.

1194
01:50:23,316 --> 01:50:24,556
Come out for a minute.

1195
01:50:37,430 --> 01:50:40,877
Forgive me, Lord.

1196
01:50:41,001 --> 01:50:43,345
It can't be anyone else, sir.

1197
01:50:44,738 --> 01:50:45,808
What proof do you have?

1198
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:48,377
I don't have any goddamn proof.

1199
01:50:51,645 --> 01:50:53,556
If the word gets out to the media...

1200
01:50:54,614 --> 01:50:56,594
...then we'll be facing
harassment charges.

1201
01:50:58,318 --> 01:50:59,854
I'll be retiring soon.

1202
01:51:00,353 --> 01:51:03,596
I don't want any
kind of stress, Mathew

1203
01:51:03,657 --> 01:51:05,330
Sir, I just need a few days.

1204
01:51:05,358 --> 01:51:08,430
Let him go... and report to my cabin.

1205
01:51:08,628 --> 01:51:10,835
I've more important case for you.

1206
01:51:35,321 --> 01:51:37,232
Forget him.
- You say.

1207
01:51:37,323 --> 01:51:38,324
Will you do it.
- Yes, I will.

1208
01:51:38,391 --> 01:51:39,563
I've people on the outside.

1209
01:51:39,626 --> 01:51:43,335
"This moon and the moonlit night."

1210
01:51:43,897 --> 01:51:51,315
"Listen to my heart's tale."

1211
01:51:52,305 --> 01:51:54,512
Mohit, visiting time.

1212
01:51:54,841 --> 01:51:58,015
S*** you just ruined all my fun.

1213
01:51:58,278 --> 01:52:01,350
Hey handsome, come soon.

1214
01:52:01,715 --> 01:52:03,626
I am waiting for you.

1215
01:52:08,388 --> 01:52:10,390
He'll have to pay up at any cost.

1216
01:52:10,423 --> 01:52:13,597
I go there every day,
but he doesn't pay up.

1217
01:52:13,827 --> 01:52:16,330
Have the other guys paid up?
- Not yet.

1218
01:52:16,396 --> 01:52:17,374
Jaga". you?

1219
01:52:17,964 --> 01:52:19,534
What's wrong with you?

1220
01:52:26,406 --> 01:52:28,511
What's wrong with you?
Why are you walking like that?

1221
01:52:29,809 --> 01:52:31,948
What?
- It's nothing.

1222
01:52:33,313 --> 01:52:34,621
Sorry.

1223
01:52:36,282 --> 01:52:40,230
Jagan, please get me out of here.

1224
01:52:40,687 --> 01:52:42,826
Find out who's behind all this.
- Shut up!

1225
01:52:43,957 --> 01:52:45,732
First, you poisoned Charles...

1226
01:52:45,759 --> 01:52:47,670
...and now you're begging me for help.

1227
01:52:47,794 --> 01:52:50,604
Why would I poison him
when everything was going fine?

1228
01:52:51,264 --> 01:52:52,265
He is my brother.

1229
01:52:52,432 --> 01:52:54,275
I never even sliced
an apple in my life...

1230
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:55,404
...how can I make cyanide?

1231
01:52:55,635 --> 01:52:57,273
Think about it.

1232
01:52:58,905 --> 01:53:01,545
I've given this some deep thought.

1233
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:07,021
Someone's trapping all of us.

1234
01:53:10,383 --> 01:53:12,420
And you're next.

1235
01:53:18,258 --> 01:53:19,328
Where are you going?

1236
01:53:19,492 --> 01:53:20,436
Jagan...

1237
01:53:20,627 --> 01:53:23,039
Jagan, please get me out of here.

1238
01:53:23,463 --> 01:53:24,635
JaQan!

1239
01:53:25,565 --> 01:53:28,546
Get me out of here, please.
- Let go.

1240
01:53:28,835 --> 01:53:30,405
Jagan.

1241
01:53:48,955 --> 01:53:53,370
Dude, I don't know what to say.

1242
01:53:57,597 --> 01:54:02,808
Whoever did this...won't survive.

1243
01:54:04,604 --> 01:54:06,606
Can you give me any hint?

1244
01:54:15,381 --> 01:54:17,793
Mo...
- What?

1245
01:54:18,685 --> 01:54:19,959
What?

1246
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:21,865
Mo...

1247
01:54:24,924 --> 01:54:26,835
Mo...

1248
01:54:27,794 --> 01:54:30,536
Mo... Mohit?

1249
01:54:32,265 --> 01:54:33,903
Mohit can never do this.

1250
01:54:34,234 --> 01:54:35,941
That dimwit...

1251
01:54:36,636 --> 01:54:39,640
He's only good for taking
a puff and passing out.

1252
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:41,846
I just met him.

1253
01:54:42,475 --> 01:54:44,250
He was in pain.

1254
01:54:45,245 --> 01:54:50,319
Yes, tell me something.

1255
01:54:57,223 --> 01:54:58,634
Mo...

1256
01:54:58,691 --> 01:55:02,833
Mo? Mo...Mother promise,
I will sc*** him.

1257
01:55:09,435 --> 01:55:10,812
At least tell me his name.

1258
01:55:11,804 --> 01:55:12,805
Who is it?

1259
01:55:16,309 --> 01:55:17,014
Huh?

1260
01:55:23,249 --> 01:55:24,557
Mom?

1261
01:55:24,851 --> 01:55:25,921
Mom?

1262
01:55:26,552 --> 01:55:27,724
Whose mom?

1263
01:55:27,954 --> 01:55:29,729
Whose mom?

1264
01:55:36,896 --> 01:55:38,432
"Call your mom?"

1265
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:42,773
"Call your mom."

1266
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:45,510
The girl's mother.

1267
01:55:46,339 --> 01:55:47,613
She did all this?

1268
01:55:49,309 --> 01:55:51,289
Yes, dude? dude?

1269
01:55:51,711 --> 01:55:52,689
Sister...

1270
01:55:53,212 --> 01:55:54,782
<i>Nurse... doctor...</i>

1271
01:55:55,448 --> 01:55:56,483
Dude?

1272
01:56:09,696 --> 01:56:10,731
Who are you?

1273
01:56:11,831 --> 01:56:12,969
And how did you get in?

1274
01:56:13,766 --> 01:56:15,803
Where is Mr. Sabarwal?

1275
01:56:16,269 --> 01:56:17,247
He's out of town.

1276
01:56:17,470 --> 01:56:18,676
But who are you?

1277
01:56:19,272 --> 01:56:22,253
Friend.

1278
01:57:26,339 --> 01:57:28,910
Lord!

1279
01:57:29,542 --> 01:57:31,579
Lord!

1280
01:57:37,450 --> 01:57:38,258
Yes, dear.

1281
01:57:39,185 --> 01:57:42,359
Actually, dear,
I was busy all night.

1282
01:57:42,855 --> 01:57:44,596
Yes, Sorry-sorry...

1283
01:57:45,324 --> 01:57:47,395
Yes, we'll have lunch together.

1284
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:49,406
Ask your mom to make
some salad as well.

1285
01:57:49,462 --> 01:57:51,271
Okay, dear.
Yes...

1286
01:58:05,511 --> 01:58:07,286
Pick up the phone, Devki.

1287
01:58:09,982 --> 01:58:11,222
Hello.

1288
01:58:13,719 --> 01:58:14,561
Hello.

1289
01:58:29,335 --> 01:58:30,439
Hello.
- Hurry up, mom.

1290
01:58:30,503 --> 01:58:33,211
Sis and Papa are waiting,
come quickly.

1291
01:58:33,272 --> 01:58:34,273
Hello.

1292
01:58:36,609 --> 01:58:41,615
So, Mr. Bond, I've been observing
from the teacher's house.

1293
01:58:42,448 --> 01:58:44,257
You've been making a number of calls.

1294
01:58:45,551 --> 01:58:47,792
Who are you? What do you want?

1295
01:58:48,287 --> 01:58:49,732
School teacher.

1296
01:58:50,256 --> 01:58:51,394
School teacher?

1297
01:58:52,291 --> 01:58:53,736
Then go look in a school instead.

1298
01:58:54,193 --> 01:58:55,672
This is my office.

1299
01:59:10,476 --> 01:59:12,353
Where I come from...

1300
01:59:13,613 --> 01:59:15,593
...no one gets a second chance.

1301
01:59:15,648 --> 01:59:18,356
I don't care where you come
from or where you go.

1302
01:59:18,584 --> 01:59:20,257
We'll soon find out.

1303
01:59:21,387 --> 01:59:22,422
Now do you know!

1304
01:59:30,796 --> 01:59:33,299
What's the password, uncle?

1305
01:59:34,901 --> 01:59:36,380
Give me your thumb.

1306
01:59:38,905 --> 01:59:41,351
You're invading my personal documents.

1307
01:59:41,908 --> 01:59:44,479
I'll have you arrested
under section 378. - Quiet.

1308
01:59:45,845 --> 01:59:49,315
I won't stay quiet...remember that.

1309
02:00:00,459 --> 02:00:02,200
Hello, Johnson Cottage.

1310
02:00:02,528 --> 02:00:03,598
Can I speak to Mrs. Devki?

1311
02:00:04,363 --> 02:00:06,502
<i>They went sight-seeing.</i>

1312
02:00:06,966 --> 02:00:08,377
Thank you.

1313
02:00:10,303 --> 02:00:11,907
Johnson Cottage...

1314
02:00:13,573 --> 02:00:15,246
...that's where she is.

1315
02:00:25,985 --> 02:00:29,865
Now that you know, take my advice.

1316
02:00:30,823 --> 02:00:31,995
Surrender yourself.

1317
02:00:32,525 --> 02:00:36,632
I am not the kind of man
that gets intimidated by a woman.

1318
02:00:37,396 --> 02:00:40,536
Man? You think you're a man.

1319
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:44,242
Men don't rape, you swine.

1320
02:00:44,570 --> 02:00:48,245
Not swine... Dinoswine.

1321
02:00:48,774 --> 02:00:49,980
Di noswi ne

1322
02:00:53,813 --> 02:00:55,656
You idiot, it's not dinoswine.

1323
02:00:56,282 --> 02:00:57,488
It's a dinosaur.

1324
02:00:57,817 --> 02:01:00,957
You're going to die by
the hands of that teacher.

1325
02:01:01,020 --> 02:01:07,665
You should learn some
English before you die.

1326
02:01:07,727 --> 02:01:09,035
Di noswi ne!

1327
02:01:10,296 --> 02:01:10,831
Di noswi ne!

1328
02:01:10,963 --> 02:01:13,466
Say it, dinosaur...

1329
02:02:00,646 --> 02:02:04,685
'I have a daughter...
she's the same age as your daughter.'

1330
02:02:05,017 --> 02:02:09,329
'I can feel what you're feeling.'

1331
02:02:17,563 --> 02:02:23,946
"The sun has... spread its arms..."

1332
02:02:24,804 --> 02:02:31,551
"...and opened new paths."

1333
02:02:32,311 --> 02:02:38,853
"May the light reflect on your lips."

1334
02:02:39,318 --> 02:02:44,825
"And you inch closer to your joys."

1335
02:02:46,258 --> 02:02:52,937
"O sweetheart...for your happiness..."

1336
02:02:54,333 --> 02:03:00,614
"...the candles burn all day."

1337
02:03:00,873 --> 02:03:08,018
"O sweetheart, for you..."

1338
02:03:08,914 --> 02:03:15,490
"...even the angels pray."

1339
02:03:24,830 --> 02:03:31,372
"As you take one
step ahead at a time..."

1340
02:03:32,271 --> 02:03:39,280
"The void gets filled."

1341
02:03:39,512 --> 02:03:45,895
"And you welcome new life...
with open arms."

1342
02:03:46,986 --> 02:03:54,404
"With the dreams filled in your eyes."

1343
02:03:54,560 --> 02:04:01,307
"O sweetheart for you..."

1344
02:04:02,668 --> 02:04:08,949
want to erase every regret."

1345
02:04:09,375 --> 02:04:15,656
"O sweetheart...for your happiness..."

1346
02:04:17,416 --> 02:04:24,493
"...the candles burn all day."

1347
02:04:40,706 --> 02:04:47,885
"I never let tears...
trickle down my chin."

1348
02:04:47,947 --> 02:04:54,387
"We'll usher in a new world of joy."

1349
02:04:55,321 --> 02:05:02,637
"All that one needs to live..."

1350
02:05:02,695 --> 02:05:10,341
"That's you and me."

1351
02:05:10,402 --> 02:05:17,251
"O sweetheart...for your happiness..."

1352
02:05:18,477 --> 02:05:24,655
"...the candles burn all day."

1353
02:05:24,950 --> 02:05:31,492
"O sweetheart, for you..."

1354
02:05:33,225 --> 02:05:41,225
"...even the angels pray."

1355
02:06:00,486 --> 02:06:01,931
Sir, DK's family.

1356
02:06:02,688 --> 02:06:03,792
Wife and daughter.

1357
02:06:06,358 --> 02:06:07,666
Papa!

1358
02:06:12,431 --> 02:06:14,536
It's been approximately 2 hours.

1359
02:06:15,968 --> 02:06:17,606
Any clue?
- No, sir.

1360
02:06:17,703 --> 02:06:20,582
Even the CCTV footage
has been destroyed.

1361
02:06:21,006 --> 02:06:22,713
Keep looking.
- Yes, sir.

1362
02:07:53,799 --> 02:07:56,643
'If you've to choose
between wrong and not right...'

1363
02:07:56,702 --> 02:07:58,875
'...then, what will you choose?'

1364
02:08:01,740 --> 02:08:02,946
'It's a pen drive.'

1365
02:08:03,375 --> 02:08:05,616
'The police are getting suspicious.'

1366
02:08:05,678 --> 02:08:07,715
'Hurry up.'

1367
02:08:09,448 --> 02:08:11,359
'Dinoswine...'
'Dinosaur...'

1368
02:08:11,417 --> 02:08:12,919
Say it, dinosaur...

1369
02:08:42,214 --> 02:08:43,215
Anand.

1370
02:08:43,749 --> 02:08:45,456
I'll go tuck her in bed.

1371
02:08:53,192 --> 02:08:54,227
Are you feeling cold?

1372
02:08:55,828 --> 02:08:57,739
Let me work the fire.

1373
02:09:02,901 --> 02:09:03,879
Is that better?

1374
02:09:06,905 --> 02:09:08,213
Negi?

1375
02:09:08,941 --> 02:09:09,976
Negi?

1376
02:09:11,677 --> 02:09:12,985
Where the hell is he?

1377
02:09:14,413 --> 02:09:15,585
I'll go take a look.

1378
02:09:42,508 --> 02:09:43,316
<i>Neg“!</i>

1379
02:09:43,575 --> 02:09:44,747
<i>Neg“!</i>

1380
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:35,630
Anand.

1381
02:10:42,234 --> 02:10:44,009
Arya

1382
02:10:45,437 --> 02:10:46,677
Run. Arya!

1383
02:10:50,275 --> 02:10:51,618
Run. Arya!

1384
02:10:52,311 --> 02:10:53,346
Anand!

1385
02:10:55,314 --> 02:10:56,349
Anand!

1386
02:10:57,716 --> 02:10:58,888
Anand!

1387
02:11:02,688 --> 02:11:03,928
Anand!

1388
02:11:08,660 --> 02:11:09,968
No one's coming.

1389
02:11:10,429 --> 02:11:13,035
Neither your husband...
nor that detective.

1390
02:11:13,332 --> 02:11:15,039
Anand!
- Shut up!

1391
02:11:21,707 --> 02:11:24,813
Just an ordinary school teacher.

1392
02:13:25,397 --> 02:13:26,603
Arya.

1393
02:13:27,833 --> 02:13:29,335
Arya.

1394
02:13:38,243 --> 02:13:39,449
Arya!

1395
02:13:42,347 --> 02:13:43,621
You...

1396
02:13:46,518 --> 02:13:47,724
You bloody...

1397
02:14:46,478 --> 02:14:47,650
What are you doing, Devki?

1398
02:14:50,415 --> 02:14:51,621
Drop the gun.

1399
02:14:53,485 --> 02:14:56,261
How dare he touch my daughter?

1400
02:14:56,922 --> 02:14:59,630
I'm telling you...drop the gun.

1401
02:14:59,691 --> 02:15:03,332
How dare he touch my daughter?

1402
02:15:03,562 --> 02:15:05,235
How dare he?

1403
02:15:05,430 --> 02:15:06,841
I've evidence, Devki.

1404
02:15:07,365 --> 02:15:08,776
I swear he'll be brought to justice.

1405
02:15:09,768 --> 02:15:11,714
But if you shoot...

1406
02:15:12,003 --> 02:15:14,279
...I swear, you'll go to jail as well.

1407
02:15:16,508 --> 02:15:19,580
How dare he touch my daughter!

1408
02:15:20,278 --> 02:15:21,985
Think about your family, Devki.

1409
02:15:22,981 --> 02:15:25,655
I'm just coming from the cottage,
Anand is alive.

1410
02:15:27,486 --> 02:15:29,523
The police are taking
him to the hospital.

1411
02:15:29,921 --> 02:15:31,525
Priya's with him.

1412
02:15:32,424 --> 02:15:33,664
Drop the gun!

1413
02:15:33,825 --> 02:15:35,498
Drop the gun!

1414
02:15:45,904 --> 02:15:47,577
It will happen again...

1415
02:15:52,210 --> 02:15:58,820
It will happen again...
and there's nothing you can do.

1416
02:16:00,752 --> 02:16:02,925
There's nothing you can do.

1417
02:16:04,623 --> 02:16:07,797
It will happen again.

1418
02:16:09,961 --> 02:16:12,771
There's nothing you can do.

1419
02:16:16,568 --> 02:16:17,945
If you want to kill him...

1420
02:16:18,904 --> 02:16:20,611
...then use the right gun.

1421
02:16:25,944 --> 02:16:27,685
What are you doing, you bas***

1422
02:16:28,313 --> 02:16:29,485
This is illegal.

1423
02:16:29,781 --> 02:16:31,920
I am telling you...shoot him!

1424
02:16:32,284 --> 02:16:34,321
I surrender.

1425
02:16:34,920 --> 02:16:36,900
I surrender.

1426
02:16:40,425 --> 02:16:41,460
Please.

1427
02:16:42,227 --> 02:16:45,231
She...poisoned my best friend.

1428
02:16:45,931 --> 02:16:47,467
She framed Mohit.

1429
02:16:47,966 --> 02:16:49,877
And emasculated Baburam.

1430
02:16:50,602 --> 02:16:54,243
You don't know anything.
- I know everything.

1431
02:16:54,973 --> 02:16:58,546
Before someone else gets here,
shoot him.

1432
02:16:58,610 --> 02:17:03,286
No-no-no, please, madam.
Please...

1433
02:17:04,883 --> 02:17:06,624
I was scared.

1434
02:17:06,685 --> 02:17:08,995
Don't listen to his bulls***.
Shoot him.

1435
02:17:09,588 --> 02:17:10,828
I can turn over a new leaf.

1436
02:17:11,423 --> 02:17:12,800
It's now or never.

1437
02:17:13,959 --> 02:17:15,404
Just one chance...

1438
02:17:15,794 --> 02:17:18,604
Give me one chance.
I surrender.

1439
02:17:18,630 --> 02:17:20,234
<i>Shoot the ha?”
- Shut up.</i>

1440
02:17:20,298 --> 02:17:22,778
Give me one chance,
I'll become a better man!

1441
02:17:22,867 --> 02:17:24,904
Pull the damn trigger!

1442
02:17:44,823 --> 02:17:45,961
“Horn!

1443
02:18:36,841 --> 02:18:38,286
“Horn!

1444
02:19:01,633 --> 02:19:03,203
I love you.

1445
02:19:27,859 --> 02:19:29,566
I love you.

1446
02:19:31,696 --> 02:19:33,903
I love you.
