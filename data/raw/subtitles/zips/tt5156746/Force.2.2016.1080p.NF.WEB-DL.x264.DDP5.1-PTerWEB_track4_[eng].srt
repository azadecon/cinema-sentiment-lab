1
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,933
Sir, these attacks are
not just on our agents

2
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,517
in fact, it's an attack on RAW.

3
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,981
Dubey, how many of our
agents are still active in China?

4
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,569
Now, 17.

5
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,113
I'm sure they will be attacked, too.

6
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,867
Sir, if our agents keep dying,

7
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:34,871
then we'll know about
the Chinese army's movement

8
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,707
only after they completely
enter Arunachal Pradesh.

9
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,918
I know this is a matter
of National Security.

10
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,254
Whoever is doing this,
he's trying to weaken RAW.

11
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,131
But who could do this, and why?

12
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,341
Only he can answer this question,
but we have to find him.

13
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,177
How will we catch him, sir?

14
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,520
<i>I'm getting you five acres</i>
<i>of land in the heart of Mumbai.</i>

15
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,106
<i>You can easily make</i>
<i>1,000 to 1,500 apartments.</i>

16
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,274
That's fine, but what about Manohar?

17
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,985
I will deal with Manohar.

18
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,374
Did you come here to buy an apartment?

19
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,128
No... I've come for you.

20
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,382
You've a court hearing today.
Did you forget?

21
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,217
Are you crazy?

22
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:33,680
You think you can drag me out
in front of my men?

23
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,017
Really? Without your uniform?

24
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,310
You think I would've spared
you if I was in uniform?

25
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,397
-We'll come later.
-No, no.

26
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,859
Go deal with him.

27
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,447
Wait.

28
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,999
My wife died five years ago.

29
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,835
Since then, I've lost my mind.

30
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,089
I tried really hard to die,
but no-one could kill me.

31
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,301
Maybe today is my lucky day.

32
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,094
There are ten to twelve of you...

33
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,763
and I am only one.

34
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,599
Maybe you can kill me.

35
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,411
I forgot to tell you one thing.

36
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:46,044
I will die. But I will
take a couple of you with me.

37
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,090
Especially you!

38
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,237
Anyone else?

39
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,739
Where are you going?

40
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,366
Wait! Don't be scared!

41
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,660
Hey! Gotya, kill him!

42
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,370
Shoot him, Gotya! Kill him!

43
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,873
Kill him! You're dead, now!
You're a dead man!

44
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,799
Wait, wait!

45
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,637
-Start the car.
-Let's go.

46
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,850
You son of a bitch.
Come on, start the car.

47
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,101
Do something.
Start the car.

48
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,311
Let's go. Let's go.

49
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,649
What are you doing?
Come on, do something. Move it!

50
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:54,988
What's going on?

51
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,823
-What's this?
-Oh my God!

52
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,159
Drive! Drive!

53
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,328
What are you doing?

54
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,169
Spare me! Let go of the car!

55
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,551
Let go.

56
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,095
Let go of the car.

57
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:31,858
Shall we?

58
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,617
<i>Sir, what do you have to say</i>
<i>about the people that died in China?</i>

59
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,328
<i>Look, our Intelligence has found out that</i>

60
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,706
<i>the people who died in China</i>
<i>were involved in criminal activities.</i>

61
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,417
<i>And they died due to an internal conflict.</i>

62
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,544
<i>But they were RAW agents, sir.</i>

63
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,300
<i>The media has sensationalized</i>
<i>this news for no reason.</i>

64
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,347
<i>As you heard,</i>
<i>the government clearly states that</i>

65
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,515
<i>India has no connection</i>
<i>with these incidents.</i>

66
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,976
<i>The people killed in Beijing,</i>
<i>Shanghai and Guangzhou</i>

67
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,853
<i>weren't Indian citizens at all.</i>

68
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,565
<i>China has maintained</i>
<i>silence on these incidents,</i>

69
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:16,236
<i>so commenting on these incidents</i>
<i>will be difficult right now.</i>

70
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,157
Is it done?

71
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,494
Yes, it's done.

72
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,249
How long will this continue?

73
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,960
As long as people like
Niranjan are running free.

74
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,337
Which means forever.

75
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,966
I'm a policeman.
If I don't do something, then who will?

76
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,594
Why? Aren't there other policemen?

77
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,390
Is it your responsibility
to bring all criminals to justice?

78
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,944
<i>One day this heart</i>

79
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:03,700
<i>Will stop beating</i>

80
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:09,372
<i>Be with me until then</i>

81
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:14,377
<i>No matter how long this night is</i>

82
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:19,924
<i>No matter how long this night is</i>

83
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:24,929
<i>I will be yours forever</i>

84
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:30,018
<i>Just give an indication</i>

85
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:35,064
<i>Where do I go without you?</i>

86
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:40,361
<i>Try to understand</i>

87
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:45,741
<i>I will tightly embrace your shadow</i>

88
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:50,121
<i>Just give an indication</i>

89
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,836
<i>You are watching </i>ABP News.

90
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,255
Mr. Yashwardhan Singh, courier for you.

91
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,265
<i>A newspaper in China</i>
<i>has confirmed that</i>

92
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:13,853
<i>the people killed in Beijing, Shanghai</i>
<i>and Guangzhou were Indian citizens.</i>

93
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:18,900
<i>This incident will definitely affect</i>
<i>the relationship between India and China.</i>

94
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,738
<i>One thing is clear. RAW agents</i>
<i>will never be known for their work</i>

95
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,324
<i>even if they sacrifice</i>
<i>their life for the country.</i>

96
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:32,330
<i>RAW agency functions in complete secrecy,</i>

97
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,665
<i>so it will be very difficult to understand</i>

98
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,959
<i>whether the people</i>
<i>who died were Indian agents.</i>

99
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,379
<i>The question is whether</i>
<i>Harish Chaturvedi, Suraj Rawat</i>

100
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,424
<i>and Arun Gupta died in an accident,</i>

101
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,468
<i>or if there's a mystery behind it.</i>

102
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:51,265
<i>The CBI is still investigating this case</i>
<i>and we hope to learn more about it soon.</i>

103
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,194
Get up, you drunkard.

104
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,196
Come on.

105
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,326
-Have we arrived?
-We haven't even started yet.

106
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,583
We've been sitting here for 30 minutes.

107
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,881
-I won't drive.
-Why?

108
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:38,604
And if I do, you would be
the one to arrest me, my cop!

109
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,065
"Cop".

110
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:42,775
And what are you?

111
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:53,286
So, tell me, Mr. Bond,
where are you being posted?

112
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,710
Tell me. What if you die?

113
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,715
The way you beat up the bad guys...

114
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,426
I'm sure that you'll be the first to die.

115
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,386
Yeah.

116
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:15,391
I'm a cop. If I die,
I will be called a martyr.

117
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,894
If anything happens to you...

118
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,648
then the government will say,
"He wasn't an Indian citizen at all."

119
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,449
Then you tell them.

120
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:36,746
You tell everyone
that I am India's best citizen.

121
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,473
Sir, none of them was an accident.

122
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,225
The Chinese agency learned
that they were RAW agents,

123
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,394
and that got them killed.

124
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,854
Someone is definitely
leaking our identity.

125
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,233
But how can a police
officer have this information?

126
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,402
Yash is not an ordinary officer.

127
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,206
You've been called in.

128
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,726
Come.

129
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,677
Please share whatever
information you have with him.

130
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,349
Harish sent this
book to me, not him.

131
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,769
Do you know what this means?

132
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,272
Harish didn't trust RAW.

133
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:40,411
There are two people in this room
whom I trust the most.

134
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,388
Harish has written
"2012" in the year 2016.

135
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,974
It's not a mistake. It's a clue.

136
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,148
It's not a date.

137
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,568
It's a page number.

138
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,325
<i>Pages six, eight and twelve.</i>

139
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,205
<i>The first letter on page six is S.</i>

140
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,291
<i>On page eight, it's P.</i>

141
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,710
-And on page 12--
-Y.

142
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:37,385
We all know there's someone
among us who is a spy for China.

143
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,011
Do you know where he is?

144
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,098
No.

145
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,516
Harish knew.

146
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,338
It takes years to make a spy network.

147
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:15,881
We must find that man.

148
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,966
Sir, I will find that man.
Let me go to Budapest.

149
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,761
You shouldn't take such complicated
matters personally, Yash.

150
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,097
I'm taking this personally.
That's why I won't turn over.

151
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,476
It's clear that one of your
men is leaking this information.

152
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,644
That is possible.

153
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:33,816
But please understand, we cannot carry
out such missions on foreign soil.

154
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,321
Times have changed,
and so has the country.

155
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,741
Now, we strike right at the heart.

156
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,329
And you're not trained
for such missions.

157
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,165
Are those who trained alive?

158
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,466
You won't regret sending him there.

159
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,642
Look, Yash, you will go there
with the Eastern European in charge, KK.

160
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,686
They've created quite a network
in the last two years.

161
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,146
Sir. I need your signature on this.

162
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,900
Yash, go and meet KK. I will join you.

163
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:28,329
<i>Did you counter-check</i>
<i>the information Martinez sent?</i>

164
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,041
Where can I find KK?

165
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,004
Send me the printouts of these, please.

166
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,135
I'm KK. Kamaljeet Kaur.

167
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,015
What was that "oh"?

168
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,310
Were you expecting a male officer?

169
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,145
Yes.

170
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,398
So, you don't think girls are capable?

171
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,276
All I know is that
KK could be a name of a guy.

172
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:00,903
By the way, who are you?

173
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,453
We've a lead on the China case.

174
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,623
Someone's leaking the identities
of our agents from the Budapest Embassy.

175
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,128
Yash is a police officer.
You two will go together.

176
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,841
I should be accompanied
by a trained RAW agent.

177
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,844
-Why this police officer?
-Because the lead came through him.

178
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,434
This is Brijesh Verma.
Our HRD Minister.

179
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:37,022
He began his career
in 1988, as an IS officer.

180
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,234
In 2012, he became the cabinet secretary.

181
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,779
He remained in this post for two years.
And entered politics in 2014.

182
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,864
He contested the election
in Meerut and became an MP.

183
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:46,990
A year later, the HRD minister.

184
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,326
Sir, this is irrelevant information.
We're wasting our time.

185
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,162
It's essential for you
to know about the HRD Minister.

186
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,790
Because he's going to Budapest
for the Indo-Hungarian summit.

187
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,418
You two will go there,
pretending to look after his security.

188
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,131
That's the RAW's way of doing things.

189
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,388
This is Naren Kaushik,
our ambassador for Hungary.

190
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,307
He will assist you with anything you need.

191
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,895
All the details
of the Budapest Embassy staff are in here.

192
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,146
SIM cards, too.

193
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,065
I'm going to Berlin three days later
for a security conference.

194
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,109
If needed, I'll come to Budapest.

195
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:25,738
-Sir, who is leading this team?
-You will, of course.

196
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,277
-What is RAW's yearly turnover?
-What?

197
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:08,197
They take good care of their employees.

198
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,034
I bought the business
class ticket myself.

199
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,998
Then you must have booked
a suite for yourself in the hotel.

200
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,209
With your money.

201
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,797
Only film-stars live in hotels.
We're going to the safe house.

202
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,032
This place is called
a safe-house for a reason.

203
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,993
Because no-one knows we're here.

204
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,746
Anyway, the ambassador
will be here in ten to fifteen minutes.

205
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,540
We need to discuss further plans.

206
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,250
How did you get the address to this place?

207
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:05,713
The ambassador emailed it to me.
Anything else?

208
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,635
Yash, what are you doing?

209
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:13,824
Come on.

210
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,155
Have you lost your mind, Yash?

211
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,325
This is not the way--

212
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,519
Your job is done. They are dead.

213
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,283
You knew there was a bomb?

214
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:21,371
If he can hack the agency's system
and get the agents names,

215
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,832
then he can read
the Ambassador's mail, too.

216
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,420
That's the Mumbai Police's
way of doing things.

217
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,888
-Where now?
-Where the film stars stay.

218
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,738
Yes, but whoever it was
thinks we're dead.

219
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,985
I'll check the footage and records
of all the employees

220
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,445
and zero in on the suspects.

221
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:38,532
After that, we'll keep
surveillance on him and find him.

222
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:43,620
Where are you going?

223
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,375
You work your way
and I'll work my way.

224
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,834
I've prepared a list of suspects.

225
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,004
And zeroed in on these three.

226
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,351
We're here to work, not to go pub-hopping.

227
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,352
He's your man.

228
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,192
Not possible.

229
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,528
He has a disciplined routine.
He used to work in Belgium.

230
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:22,904
Never missed office.

231
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,574
Always punctual. Makes good money, too.

232
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,701
No connection with the Chinese.

233
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,411
No alcohol or cigarettes, either.

234
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,663
No girlfriend. He'd go
straight home from the office.

235
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,000
He's too clean.

236
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,128
These are my three suspects.

237
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,846
There's been a considerable change
in his behavior in the last two months.

238
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,057
For someone who never worked overtime,

239
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,894
what made him so hard-working
that he works overtime every day?

240
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,026
He married this girl three months ago.

241
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,778
She's a resident of Hong Kong.

242
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,572
They didn't meet before,
or even go on a date.

243
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,366
So, why did they suddenly get married?

244
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,162
I suspect him the most.

245
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:16,041
Before Budapest, he worked for three years
at the Indian Embassy in China.

246
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,918
And he handles the Chinese desk over here.

247
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,216
Like you said, he hacked
our entire system from Budapest.

248
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,885
We'll send a coded email
to the Ambassador from a fake ID

249
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,889
stating that a Chinese embassy official
has agreed to be our agent.

250
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,308
And he's coming to meet us
at the Glasshouse Art Gallery.

251
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,229
And whoever our guy is,
he will definitely decode our email.

252
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,816
And if our suspicion is true,
he will show up.

253
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:43,985
You are right.

254
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,949
He will definitely come there.

255
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,342
Any time now.

256
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:44,773
Thank you.

257
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,665
I told you he'd come, Yash.

258
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,960
Ma'am, he's making a call.

259
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:09,172
Hold on.

260
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,134
He's not making a call,
he's taking pictures.

261
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,348
Yash, I...

262
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,623
I'll ask the questions.

263
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,255
Yes, ma'am.

264
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,508
That's my personal phone.
You can't use it.

265
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,552
-Yash, where are you?
-KK, your plan was good,

266
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,721
but you got the wrong guy.

267
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,599
-Let Amit go.
-What? Why?

268
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:02,411
The right guy never
went inside the gallery.

269
00:35:02,511 --> 00:35:03,374
Who?

270
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,316
You're wasting your time.
I've already arrested Amit.

271
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:13,111
Check the CCTV footage.
I'm going to Shiv's house.

272
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,248
-What were you doing in the gallery?
-I...

273
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,793
Someone forwarded me an email
which was sent to the Ambassador.

274
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,337
-And it was written--
-Someone forwarded you the mail?

275
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:32,303
Yes!

276
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,306
-You, show me the CCTV footage.
-Yes, ma'am.

277
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:08,875
This is your man.

278
00:40:51,151 --> 00:40:52,033
Hello.

279
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,702
Yash, you were right about Shiv.

280
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:57,622
-Where are you?
-Behind his building.

281
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,792
-I'm right outside his door.
-He's not inside.

282
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:05,797
But there is someone inside.

283
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,659
It's you.

284
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:36,786
I was scared for a moment.

285
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,776
What happened?
Where did he go?

286
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,567
I don't know.

287
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,864
Well, he didn't come downstairs.
That means...

288
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,462
You have another opportunity, today.

289
00:45:58,381 --> 00:45:59,757
You can't shoot?

290
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,305
I definitely can.

291
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,140
Want to see?

292
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:47,930
You're hiding something from me.

293
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:52,476
What do you want to say?

294
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:55,438
I feel that Shiv knows you.

295
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,982
Of course you do.
He's my fiancé, after all.

296
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,485
Why did he say that you can't shoot?

297
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,456
It's hard to believe that
this guy could do something like this.

298
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,833
Where did you recruit him from?

299
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,754
We placed an ad for a consultant.

300
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,007
He had all the necessary qualifications.

301
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:27,303
He's from Belgium. He speaks
Hungarian and French.

302
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,765
Did you notice anything
suspicious about him?

303
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:31,927
Not at all.

304
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,519
He's hard-working
and good at what he does.

305
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,855
He used to mind his own business.

306
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:39,774
I thought it was a big plus.

307
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:41,650
So, he has no family?

308
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,031
He was only three years old
when his parents passed away.

309
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:49,825
He grew up in an orphanage in Faridabad.

310
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:54,037
Later, he went to America
for higher studies on a scholarship.

311
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,957
Anyway, we've spoken
to the Hungarian authorities.

312
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,793
The paperwork's complete, too.

313
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:02,088
You can take him to India tonight.

314
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:05,966
Postpone our travel.
I want to interrogate him.

315
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:08,677
Our orders are that we must
immediately take him to India.

316
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,095
He'll be interrogated there.

317
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:12,890
If we interrogate him now,
we might save someone's life.

318
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,685
You follow orders. I'm going in.

319
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,854
You forget who is leading the team.

320
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,525
Look, I know Harish was your friend.

321
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:25,611
But the other agents
had friends and family, too.

322
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,530
This is not a personal fight.

323
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,418
We found nothing.

324
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:44,505
We found this when we checked his clothes,
but there's nothing in here either.

325
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:48,801
If you're done ogling at me,
can we get to my clothes?

326
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:55,808
No, no, no. These are...

327
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:02,940
These clothes can’t be
your choice, Ms. Kaur.

328
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:10,656
But yes, often people in uniforms
have bad taste in clothes.

329
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,325
Don't talk about uniforms.

330
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:14,473
Why?

331
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:15,828
Why?

332
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:17,997
Why?

333
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:22,751
Because I’m a traitor, right?

334
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:29,008
Let's not argue
over patriotism and treachery.

335
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,428
You will lose.

336
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,599
Are you done? Shall we go?

337
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,309
Wear your clothes.

338
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,811
Or else I will drag you
to India like this.

339
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,015
We've left the embassy.

340
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,268
It will take us almost
an hour to get to the airport.

341
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:25,481
One hour.

342
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:30,236
This will be the longest
hour of your life.

343
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:33,072
We won't get to the airport. Ask me why.

344
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:35,991
Ask.

345
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,120
Because there is a problem with our team.

346
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:41,664
What a peculiar team.

347
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:44,625
A rich brat RAW agent who can't shoot

348
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:49,129
and a Police Officer
who couldn't save his wife.

349
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,799
How will they save their agents?

350
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,886
You'd better be careful, Ms. Kaur.

351
00:50:56,637 --> 00:51:01,183
Ms. Kaur, anyone who has any kind
of relationship with him ends up dead.

352
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,102
Take Harish, for instance.

353
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,065
That's what he wants.

354
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:14,446
And as far as relationships are concerned,
Ms. Kaur's were always in a mess.

355
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,283
You know, when she was 18,

356
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:21,078
her dad was going around
with another 18-year-old girl.

357
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,246
Like this.

358
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,707
She was 18, and so was that girl.

359
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:26,792
How would Ms. Kaur feel?

360
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,546
Poor thing--

361
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:36,092
Sir. Sir, please handle her.

362
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,262
Sir, handle her.

363
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,640
I hate violence.

364
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:44,435
That reminds me. Two more
of your men are going to die.

365
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,187
Shut up. Another word
and you'll regret it.

366
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:02,995
If you hadn't shut me up, he could've
been saved. This one's on you, ma'am.

367
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,628
There are two bikes.

368
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,297
That's right, there are
two bikes. Go faster!

369
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,103
What are you doing, sir?

370
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:30,272
One's dead. Can you save the other one?

371
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,986
Unbelievable, one says "shut up",
the says "talk"...

372
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,780
I'm telling you, this team isn't right!

373
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:40,658
-Tell me.
-Yash! What are you doing?

374
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:42,117
Where will the next agent be killed?

375
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,538
Yash, pull him inside, now.

376
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:48,499
Talk!

377
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:57,341
Thirty minutes. He will die in 30 minutes.
And only you can save him.

378
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:58,467
Thirty minutes...

379
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:02,221
-So, he's somewhere in Budapest.
-That's good, that's good.

380
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:06,850
So what if Ms. Kaur can't shoot?
At least she can use her brain.

381
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:15,942
Now, use your brain on this.

382
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:19,071
One angel, four paths.
How will you save your friend?

383
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,798
Take it inside that building.
We'll have to wait here for a while.

384
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,120
KK, there.

385
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:40,963
Who are you?

386
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:43,549
We need your help.

387
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,567
I don't have time for 20 questions.

388
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,986
Tell me where they'll kill
the other agent.

389
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,320
Tell me.

390
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,781
They are already scared. Don't!

391
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,913
"One angel, four paths."

392
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,560
"One angel, four paths"!

393
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:32,366
We still have ten minutes.

394
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,310
<i>We've only ten minutes to save</i>
<i>the next agent, Yash.</i>

395
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:49,818
Hurry up, Yash!

396
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,406
We don't have much time.

397
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,258
Where is he?

398
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,094
You're at the right place.

399
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:19,973
But unfortunately, you're 20 feet above.

400
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,893
Heroes' Square is also a metro station.

401
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,159
He's dead.

402
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:27,249
Poor guy. He was a nice man.

403
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:32,129
He use to flirt a bit,
but at the end... he was a man.

404
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:40,011
Yash, what are you doing?
We want him alive.

405
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,347
We wanted our man alive, not him!

406
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:44,057
Why?

407
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:47,102
Our men, our country...

408
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:48,770
Money?

409
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:51,731
How much money is enough
to let our own men die?

410
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:55,110
You think I'm doing this for money?

411
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,159
Then why are you doing this?
What do you want?

412
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:06,705
You two can't give me what I want.

413
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,333
We've already missed one flight.
We can't miss another.

414
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:33,565
It must be really hard
to tolerate failure, right?

415
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:37,068
By now, you two must be accustomed...

416
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:38,737
to failure.

417
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:43,533
Two losers, here to catch a winner.

418
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:48,955
RAW should’ve sent someone more capable.

419
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:58,882
Here comes the cavalry.

420
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,598
First the apartment, now here.

421
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,808
How do they know where we are?

422
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:11,978
What? Don't look at me.

423
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,605
You have my phone.

424
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,857
And you guys already checked
all the holes in my body.

425
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,570
How could I tell anyone?

426
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,948
I doubt it's one of you.

427
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,033
Someone's dirty.

428
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,179
Where are you going, Yash?
The tunnel is closed.

429
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,347
I know.

430
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:53,597
Kudos to you two.

431
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:54,974
I mean, that was good.

432
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:59,354
But I'll give you a chance
to be impressed by me.

433
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:01,272
At the airport.

434
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:06,236
I mean... there were
so many men on the way,

435
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:08,488
so I'm sure the entire army's
waiting at the airport.

436
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:10,907
Who says we're going to the airport?

437
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,213
Where are you taking me?

438
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:17,015
This helicopter will land
directly on the airport's tarmac.

439
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:22,038
<i>Another agent of ours</i>
<i>was killed in Malaysia.</i>

440
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,749
<i>Bring Shiv to India</i>
<i>as soon as you can.</i>

441
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:55,530
Now we'll never know how many
names he gave to the Chinese.

442
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:59,450
Someone was definitely
telling them about our location.

443
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:02,870
How else did they know we were
coming here, and not to the airport.

444
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:04,247
But who could it be?

445
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:11,879
Something's wrong.

446
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:15,341
You're thinking too much, Yash.

447
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:21,389
They tried to save him all day.

448
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:24,434
-So why did they kill him suddenly?
-It's simple.

449
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:26,727
When they realized they couldn't stop Shiv

450
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:28,521
from being taken to India,
they killed him.

451
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,231
Why didn't they kill us?

452
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,823
-Did you check his bullet wound?
-No, why?

453
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:59,052
Sir, nature is just amazing.

454
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,512
Have you heard about the Medusa Spider?

455
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:03,848
<i>I hadn't, either.</i>

456
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:09,687
The venom of this spider
can stop a man's heartbeat for 30 minutes.

457
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:30,917
But next time, your
heartbeat will stop for good.

458
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:34,379
I mean, you're such a player.

459
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,297
<i>You even have one-liners for your defeat.</i>

460
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,174
How is Ms. Kaur?

461
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:40,134
<i>She must be upset.</i>

462
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:43,179
-Take care of her.
-You think about yourself.

463
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:45,932
How long do you think
they can protect you?

464
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:50,395
<i>I mean, you won't give up.</i>

465
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:52,689
This game's gonna be fun.

466
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:55,066
Killing six people is a game for you?

467
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:56,818
I didn't start this game, sir.

468
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,153
But I'll definitely finish it.

469
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:03,616
By the way, don't forget
to thank Ms. Kaur on my behalf.

470
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,160
<i>None of this would've</i>
<i>been possible without her.</i>

471
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:07,870
<i>Don't be surprised, sir.</i>

472
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:10,248
Time is a game-changer.

473
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,084
<i>Check Ms. Kaur's watch</i>
<i>when you've got time.</i>

474
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:16,411
What's wrong?

475
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:18,589
What are you doing, Yash?

476
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:37,650
Anjan, Shiv could be anywhere in Europe.

477
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:40,737
Catching him is impossible right now.

478
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:42,805
KK, there was a tracker in your watch.

479
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:46,492
What exactly happened, that day?

480
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:52,540
It's you.

481
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,459
I was scared for a moment.

482
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:57,086
Quietly hand over the laptop
and come with me to the embassy.

483
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,158
"Quietly"?

484
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:01,758
That's one thing I can't do.

485
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:05,887
And you are three minutes
and 30 seconds late.

486
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:09,640
-I just deleted everything.
-Stay there.

487
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,684
Do you want to check?

488
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:18,900
This is all my fault.

489
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,113
KK, we must order an inquiry on you.

490
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:26,240
<i>Come back. I'm sending a replacement.</i>

491
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:27,311
No.

492
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:28,743
What?

493
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:31,329
KK won't go back.

494
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:33,915
KK is a capable officer and I trust her.

495
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,124
But that tracker?

496
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:36,959
He must have slipped it in
when she was unconscious.

497
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:50,348
It could've happened to anyone.

498
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:51,974
We will catch him.

499
01:11:58,689 --> 01:11:59,607
What?

500
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:04,612
One thing's clear.

501
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:06,989
He's giving them one name after another.

502
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,575
Surely, the Chinese
are giving him something.

503
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:11,327
Yes, but what?

504
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:18,417
-Yes, sir.
-KK, there's been a development.

505
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:22,880
We've been trying to turn Chinese official
for the past six months.

506
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,925
<i>He'll give us Shiv's location in one hour.</i>

507
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:33,641
Where are you going? Didn't you hear?
We'll get his location soon.

508
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:35,101
WhatsApp me when you get it.

509
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:12,800
<i>You think I'm doing this for money?</i>

510
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,765
<i>Then why are you doing this?</i>
<i>What do you want?</i>

511
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:28,858
-Where are you, sir?
-In your house.

512
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:31,360
When did you last clean?

513
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,487
Why do you always by unannounced?

514
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:36,574
<i>If you'd alerted me in advance,</i>
<i>I would've arranged for tea and snacks.</i>

515
01:15:37,607 --> 01:15:39,474
Do you need something,
or did you call to waste my time?

516
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:42,580
Sir, do you know
the biggest problem with Indians?

517
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,749
So, you did call to waste my time.

518
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:48,878
We Indians never do our jobs ourselves.

519
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:50,713
<i>We keep delegating them.</i>

520
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:55,051
Look. A poor Chinese man ended up dead
trying to give away my location.

521
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:00,264
<i>Too bad.</i>

522
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:04,226
How about some advice? For free?

523
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:07,646
<i>Stop looking for me.</i>

524
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:11,817
<i>Marry Ms. Kaur and settle down</i>
<i>in some hill-station.</i>

525
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:13,736
<i>You two are old enough, now.</i>

526
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:17,281
Here's my advice for you.

527
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:19,575
Sell your home...

528
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:23,037
and get used to living
in a room without windows.

529
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:45,911
Yes, boss.

530
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:49,290
<i>-I'm listening, boss.</i>
-I've a job for you.

531
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:55,129
Yash, where are you?

532
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:56,881
-That Chinese official...
-He's dead.

533
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:58,841
What? How?

534
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:03,470
How would a RAW agent find him now?

535
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,141
Through my Hungarian contact, Martinez.

536
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:10,102
I'll call Anjan, you talk to Martinez.

537
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:12,646
Martinez never takes calls. Only texts.

538
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:33,500
This is the address he gave me.

539
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:44,678
Where is Martinez?

540
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:47,514
-You want a martini?
-Where is Martinez?

541
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:49,558
Virai, where's Martinez?

542
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:51,018
Looking for Martinez?

543
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:52,645
Upstairs.

544
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:55,461
Upstairs.

545
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,189
Where is Martinez?

546
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:38,649
There's Martinez.

547
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:51,119
-What do you mean, "oh"?
-I thought--

548
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:52,705
You thought it was a man.

549
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:56,333
So, you don't think girls are capable?

550
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:11,139
<i>O sweetheart... my eyes</i>

551
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:14,560
<i>Have been yearning for you</i>

552
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:17,979
<i>O sweetheart... you weren't here</i>

553
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:21,441
<i>And I held on to your memories</i>

554
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:24,653
<i>O sweetheart... my eyes</i>

555
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:28,323
<i>Have been yearning for you</i>

556
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:31,493
<i>O sweetheart... you weren't here</i>

557
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:34,997
<i>And I held on to your memories</i>

558
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:38,417
<i>How do I explain</i>

559
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:44,006
<i>The emotions stirring in my heart?</i>

560
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:48,677
<i>The days and nights are unbearable</i>

561
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:52,347
<i>I had to tell you</i>
<i>What's in my heart</i>

562
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:55,558
<i>The days and nights are unbearable</i>

563
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:59,312
<i>I had to tell you</i>
<i>What's in my heart</i>

564
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:05,819
<i>So I say this to you,</i>

565
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:09,406
<i>I love you</i>

566
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:12,867
<i>I love you</i>

567
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:16,329
<i>I love you</i>

568
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:19,750
<i>I love you</i>

569
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:32,387
<i>As you looked at me,</i>

570
01:21:32,471 --> 01:21:35,724
<i>my heart felt an uproar</i>

571
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:39,185
<i>Your intoxication</i>
<i>Is slowly growing on me</i>

572
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:42,939
<i>And stealing my senses</i>

573
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:49,696
<i>Stealing my senses</i>

574
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:54,200
<i>The days and nights are unbearable</i>

575
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:57,620
<i>I had to tell you</i>
<i>What's in my heart</i>

576
01:21:57,704 --> 01:22:01,041
<i>The days and nights are unbearable</i>

577
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:04,586
<i>I had to tell you</i>
<i>What's in my heart</i>

578
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:11,259
<i>So I say this to you,</i>

579
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:14,680
<i>I love you</i>

580
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:18,183
<i>I love you</i>

581
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:21,186
<i>I love you</i>

582
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:29,486
<i>I love you</i>

583
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:39,246
She doesn't have a clue
about where she is.

584
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,623
How could she tell us about Shiv?

585
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:46,044
We need to find someone named
Shiv Sharma.

586
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:48,755
No problem.

587
01:22:49,756 --> 01:22:54,595
I have a condition. I don't want money.
I want to bang him.

588
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:56,346
What is she saying?

589
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:01,559
-She'll help us, but in exchange--
-Just say "yes" to whatever she wants.

590
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:03,187
Finding Shiv is more important.

591
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:09,443
Yes!

592
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:17,409
You can bang him.

593
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:20,370
When?

594
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:24,416
-She's asking when?
-As soon as she does the job.

595
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:27,544
As soon as you give us the location.

596
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:30,255
Tonight.

597
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:33,509
Something's fishy about her.

598
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:36,303
She hasn't given us
any wrong information to date.

599
01:23:36,887 --> 01:23:38,680
She'll give us the location tonight.

600
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:40,015
How do you know?

601
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:44,520
-She seems to be in a hurry.
-What for?

602
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:51,985
Ask him to take a shower.
He smells like shit.

603
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:55,447
What did she say now?

604
01:24:00,786 --> 01:24:01,995
She wants you to take a bath.

605
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:45,539
Clothes for you.

606
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:51,795
Why did you do that?

607
01:24:53,213 --> 01:24:55,591
-You want to have sex on this?
-What are you saying?

608
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:57,843
-I'll take that off--
-What are you doing?

609
01:24:58,176 --> 01:24:59,720
-Don't be shy!
-Go away!

610
01:25:00,137 --> 01:25:02,097
You cheat!

611
01:25:02,723 --> 01:25:04,599
Moron!

612
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:07,269
I've had enough of you, get lost.

613
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,771
-We had a deal!
-Get lost.

614
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:11,648
You're a cheat!

615
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:52,898
Wait!

616
01:25:53,607 --> 01:25:54,900
What's wrong? That was quick.

617
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,610
-So that was her condition?
-Yes. What's wrong?

618
01:25:57,694 --> 01:25:58,862
Didn't anything happen?

619
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:00,781
Have you lost your mind?

620
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:03,575
You're a deal-breaker!

621
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:07,412
Now this will cost you double.

622
01:26:07,511 --> 01:26:08,413
No problem.

623
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:10,957
-Moron!
-Go away!

624
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:12,125
Rascal.

625
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,213
Shiv is in Holloko Village.

626
01:28:00,317 --> 01:28:02,903
It's still hot.
He couldn't have gone too far.

627
01:28:05,363 --> 01:28:06,490
He must be somewhere around.

628
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:13,788
-Yes, Samant.
-Shiv Sharma was in this orphanage,

629
01:28:13,872 --> 01:28:15,207
but he died ten years ago.

630
01:28:19,419 --> 01:28:20,337
Hello?

631
01:28:21,338 --> 01:28:22,297
Hello?

632
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:50,051
Balraj, talk to the home
minister if you have to.

633
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:53,013
Yes, Yash?

634
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:56,433
Sir, that man is not Shiv Sharma.
He might not even be an orphan.

635
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:59,019
<i>Whoever he is,</i>
<i>he stole Shiv Sharma's identity.</i>

636
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:02,438
Use all your resources in India.
Start with the orphanage

637
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:05,692
and find out everything you
can about this imposter in 24 hours.

638
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:11,531
Mhatre, assemble a team.

639
01:30:54,616 --> 01:30:55,492
Good job.

640
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:58,536
Are you crazy?
Why did you stay in the village?

641
01:30:59,746 --> 01:31:02,123
Because if they didn't see me
they wouldn't trust you.

642
01:31:02,624 --> 01:31:06,878
Now, they'll trust whatever you tell them.

643
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:08,797
Smart!

644
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,134
And hitting those men was a good touch.

645
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:16,624
See you!

646
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:51,381
Now what do you want?

647
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:53,341
He got away. We need his next location.

648
01:31:53,717 --> 01:31:57,595
-More money or get out.
-What is she saying this time?

649
01:31:57,929 --> 01:31:59,162
Will she do the job or not?

650
01:32:00,598 --> 01:32:01,474
She will.

651
01:32:42,057 --> 01:32:43,725
Where do you want me to send them?

652
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:49,314
Send them to Berlin.

653
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:24,808
What?

654
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:27,977
I know you don't drink coffee.

655
01:33:33,566 --> 01:33:34,734
Can I ask you something?

656
01:33:36,152 --> 01:33:38,321
Why did you support me
in front of Anjan the other day?

657
01:33:38,822 --> 01:33:39,864
Because I'm crazy.

658
01:33:42,909 --> 01:33:43,827
Completely insane.

659
01:33:55,004 --> 01:33:56,965
In 2013 we received a tip-off...

660
01:33:57,966 --> 01:34:01,010
that a Naxal-terrorist was
hiding in a lodge in Lajpat Nagar.

661
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:04,305
We arrived at the scene, he ran for it.

662
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:09,269
I could've shot him,
but that day, I couldn't.

663
01:34:11,729 --> 01:34:13,565
Two days later, he killed five people.

664
01:34:14,816 --> 01:34:16,609
Since that day, I...

665
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:34,169
Harish and I were childhood friends.

666
01:34:35,461 --> 01:34:37,755
We even went to school
and college together.

667
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:40,717
In fact, we even joined
the force together.

668
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:43,887
He would often joke about
how crazy I am.

669
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:46,108
Complete lunatic.

670
01:34:49,142 --> 01:34:52,812
I thought I'd definitely get killed
and he would investigate my murder.

671
01:34:55,064 --> 01:34:59,652
Neither he nor I ever imagined
that I'd be investigating his murder.

672
01:35:20,715 --> 01:35:21,716
You were right.

673
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:23,718
His name isn't Shiv.

674
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:26,304
His real name is Rudra Pratap Singh.

675
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:29,390
His father, Karan Pratap Singh,
was an undercover agent for RAW in China.

676
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:35,230
The Chinese Intelligence Agency
found out that he was a RAW agent.

677
01:35:36,105 --> 01:35:38,858
RAW disowned him
on our cabinet secretary's orders.

678
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:42,195
That's the world of spying.

679
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:45,031
If you're caught, we don't know you.

680
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:48,701
<i>Which is why he assumed the name</i>
<i>and identity of his deceased friend.</i>

681
01:35:48,952 --> 01:35:50,703
<i>So that he could take revenge against RAW.</i>

682
01:35:51,287 --> 01:35:53,539
<i>-When did this happen?</i>
-2012.

683
01:35:56,668 --> 01:35:58,628
I'll call you
as soon as I reach to Berlin.

684
01:36:04,133 --> 01:36:06,219
-He isn't trying to take revenge on RAW.
-What?

685
01:36:07,971 --> 01:36:11,099
He killed four of our agents.
If this isn't revenge, then what is it?

686
01:36:11,557 --> 01:36:12,725
It's not that simple.

687
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,688
He wants to use RAW
to get to someone else.

688
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,814
Who?

689
01:36:21,651 --> 01:36:24,070
-Where are you going now?
-To find the answer to your question.

690
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:30,785
<i>Yes, dad, I'm just</i>
<i>leaving for the airport.</i>

691
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,204
When are you reaching India?
When is your flight?

692
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:40,086
Son, it seems like
I won't be able to make it.

693
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:42,714
Please don't say you're tied up with work.

694
01:36:44,299 --> 01:36:47,302
I... I wanted to come to Seattle, instead.

695
01:36:48,303 --> 01:36:52,056
Stroll into your office,
see how you're working.

696
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:55,476
Later we could've gone for a walk.

697
01:36:59,856 --> 01:37:01,441
We could've had a beer together.

698
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:06,195
We never had a beer together, did we?

699
01:37:06,487 --> 01:37:09,449
Yes, dad, but why are you saying this now?
Did something happen?

700
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:17,582
I hid something from you.
No, I hid something from all of you.

701
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:22,086
What? Dad, I don't understand
what you're saying.

702
01:37:23,463 --> 01:37:24,714
For the last 30 years...

703
01:37:26,382 --> 01:37:28,760
I've been not been working
for some tech company...

704
01:37:30,595 --> 01:37:31,971
but for RAW.

705
01:37:42,565 --> 01:37:46,277
<i>Please come now. Things will</i>
<i>be fine when we meet again.</i>

706
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,951
What do you mean, "it's too late"?
Why are you saying such things?

707
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:56,454
<i>Please just come. Everything will be fine.</i>

708
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:03,544
Look after your mother and sister.

709
01:38:31,864 --> 01:38:34,075
<i>The media has turned this into a farce.</i>

710
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:36,953
<i>Karan Pratap is not a RAW Agent.</i>

711
01:38:37,662 --> 01:38:40,497
<i>Karan Pratap has no connection</i>
<i>with RAW whatsoever.</i>

712
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:44,001
<i>But his family claims that he was</i>
<i>working for RAW for the last 30 years.</i>

713
01:38:45,086 --> 01:38:48,005
<i>Look, we even heard</i>
<i>that he was working for China.</i>

714
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:50,758
<i>He was selling India's secrets to China.</i>

715
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,384
<i>Now, who do we believe?</i>

716
01:38:52,468 --> 01:38:54,887
<i>Are you trying to say</i>
<i>that Karan Pratap was a traitor?</i>

717
01:38:54,971 --> 01:38:58,099
<i>You're all smart people. You know best.</i>

718
01:39:13,573 --> 01:39:16,367
Your father's bank balance
has been transferred in your names.

719
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:18,911
And the locker, as well.

720
01:39:19,745 --> 01:39:21,289
There isn't much in it.

721
01:39:21,914 --> 01:39:23,708
Just some jewelry.

722
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:28,463
I guess your father was
too honest, wasn't he?

723
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:33,718
I met with the Cabinet Secretary.

724
01:39:35,136 --> 01:39:36,929
He said there's nothing that can be done.

725
01:39:38,556 --> 01:39:41,809
I tried to explain that I have two kids.

726
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:45,229
But he said...

727
01:39:46,272 --> 01:39:49,859
"You'll have to live
with the label of 'traitor'."

728
01:40:26,604 --> 01:40:27,522
<i>You were right.</i>

729
01:40:28,105 --> 01:40:29,232
His name isn't Shiv.

730
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:31,817
His real name is Rudra Pratap Singh.

731
01:40:36,489 --> 01:40:39,325
<i>His father, Karan Pratap Singh,</i>
<i>was an undercover agent for RAW in China.</i>

732
01:40:40,826 --> 01:40:44,205
Let's not argue
over patriotism and treachery.

733
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:45,540
You will lose.

734
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,920
<i>The Chinese Intelligence Agency</i>
<i>found out that he was a RAW agent.</i>

735
01:40:51,671 --> 01:40:54,632
<i>RAW disowned him</i>
<i>on our cabinet secretary's orders.</i>

736
01:40:54,966 --> 01:40:57,426
You think I'm doing this for money?

737
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:02,348
<i>When did this happen?</i>

738
01:41:03,349 --> 01:41:04,225
2012.

739
01:41:04,642 --> 01:41:05,851
2012!

740
01:41:12,775 --> 01:41:14,694
2012!

741
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:16,445
This game's gonna be fun.

742
01:41:16,529 --> 01:41:18,364
<i>Killing six people is a game for you?</i>

743
01:41:18,656 --> 01:41:20,408
I didn't start this game, sir.

744
01:41:20,908 --> 01:41:22,868
2012.

745
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:24,411
<i>In 2012, he became the cabinet secretary.</i>

746
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:26,413
He contested the election
in Meerut and became an MP.

747
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:27,748
<i>A year later, the HRD minister.</i>

748
01:41:28,874 --> 01:41:31,252
This is Brijesh Verma.
Our HRD Minister.

749
01:41:32,253 --> 01:41:35,590
He began his career
in 1988, as an IS officer.

750
01:41:35,965 --> 01:41:39,135
<i>Look, even we heard</i>
<i>that he was working for China.</i>

751
01:41:39,635 --> 01:41:43,764
<i>He was selling India's secrets to China.</i>
<i>Now, who do we believe?</i>

752
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:55,067
Martinez just called. Rudra is in Berlin.

753
01:41:55,192 --> 01:41:57,403
Anjan is arriving there tomorrow.
He's his next target.

754
01:41:58,321 --> 01:42:00,156
Rudra isn't in Berlin. He's right here.

755
01:42:01,365 --> 01:42:02,533
How do you know?

756
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:05,411
Because he wants to kill
the HRD Minister, Brijesh Verma.

757
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:08,497
Right here, in Budapest.

758
01:43:56,272 --> 01:43:57,981
So, Rudra chose to be posted in Budapest

759
01:43:58,065 --> 01:44:00,234
because this summit
was planned almost a year ago?

760
01:44:01,026 --> 01:44:02,737
And sending us to Berlin
was one of his plans.

761
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:04,363
He knew that Anjan was going there.

762
01:44:05,781 --> 01:44:06,741
That means Martinez...

763
01:44:10,536 --> 01:44:12,413
-We must stop this summit, Yash.
-No.

764
01:44:12,621 --> 01:44:15,750
If we stop this summit,
we'll never catch Rudra.

765
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,794
Are you going to let a minister die
just to catch Rudra?

766
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:21,630
We're going to save him.

767
01:44:23,007 --> 01:44:23,883
We'll shoot him.

768
01:44:24,467 --> 01:44:25,342
What?

769
01:44:36,812 --> 01:44:39,231
The only difference is,
they will shoot to kill...

770
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:41,150
and we'll shoot to save.

771
01:44:41,358 --> 01:44:43,193
What's the guarantee
that Rudra will be there?

772
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:44,278
He just will be.

773
01:44:45,821 --> 01:44:47,782
Yash, finding him
there will be impossible.

774
01:44:48,324 --> 01:44:51,702
When the bullets are fired,
only one man in the hall won't run.

775
01:44:55,581 --> 01:44:57,958
Putting a minister's life
at stake like this is wrong.

776
01:44:58,209 --> 01:45:00,503
Ministers should help their country
when in need.

777
01:45:11,555 --> 01:45:13,890
I can't believe that you're
going to shoot the minister.

778
01:45:13,974 --> 01:45:15,518
Not me. You.

779
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:23,317
Yash, I can't do it.

780
01:45:25,569 --> 01:45:27,696
-We have no other options.
-Why don't you understand?

781
01:45:28,447 --> 01:45:30,950
-I can't shoot.
-You can.

782
01:45:31,367 --> 01:45:32,743
You cannot fail twice.

783
01:46:38,726 --> 01:46:41,020
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

784
01:46:41,562 --> 01:46:44,815
It gives me great pleasure
to welcome the Indian HRD Minister,

785
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:46,483
Mr. Brijesh Verma, to Hungary.

786
01:46:47,651 --> 01:46:51,738
I'd like to call upon him to open

787
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:54,533
the first Indo-Hungarian Summit.

788
01:47:28,651 --> 01:47:29,860
You cannot fail twice.

789
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:45,926
It's no use. I'm gonna kill
this bloody minister.

790
01:52:46,510 --> 01:52:49,346
What nonsense is this? Who is he?

791
01:52:50,138 --> 01:52:51,640
Karan Pratap's son.

792
01:52:54,518 --> 01:52:56,979
-The one you had killed.
-Killed?

793
01:53:00,899 --> 01:53:01,900
Thirty years.

794
01:53:02,567 --> 01:53:04,819
Father dedicated 30 years
of his life to RAW and his country.

795
01:53:04,903 --> 01:53:07,489
But what did he get in return?
He was labeled a traitor.

796
01:53:07,823 --> 01:53:08,865
And died in disgrace.

797
01:53:09,408 --> 01:53:12,535
Every RAW Agent knows
the consequences of being caught.

798
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:14,454
-Even your father.
-And my mom?

799
01:53:17,582 --> 01:53:18,917
What was my mother's fault?

800
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:22,838
My mother killed herself because of you.

801
01:53:24,673 --> 01:53:26,967
What he did to your family was wrong.

802
01:53:27,759 --> 01:53:29,136
But you're doing the same thing.

803
01:53:29,886 --> 01:53:33,473
If I have to ruin 100 more families
to get to him, I--

804
01:53:33,557 --> 01:53:34,558
You're forgetting one thing.

805
01:53:35,017 --> 01:53:38,020
I'm holding the gun.
And you're going to jail.

806
01:53:45,986 --> 01:53:48,280
Do you know how many
undercover RAW agents there are

807
01:53:48,572 --> 01:53:49,990
in China and Hong Kong?

808
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:52,576
Do you?

809
01:53:55,162 --> 01:53:56,038
Seventeen!

810
01:53:57,331 --> 01:53:58,915
And how many names do I know?

811
01:53:59,499 --> 01:54:00,417
All of them.

812
01:54:01,376 --> 01:54:03,128
All the names are up here.

813
01:54:03,628 --> 01:54:05,672
How many are you going to deem traitors?

814
01:54:06,631 --> 01:54:07,716
I will go to jail...

815
01:54:08,342 --> 01:54:12,179
but I will give all the names
to the Chinese, just so I can kill you.

816
01:54:13,305 --> 01:54:16,183
-Seventeen agents will die, unless--
-No!

817
01:54:20,395 --> 01:54:23,065
Sir, they will die--

818
01:54:34,576 --> 01:54:36,495
No more RAW agents will die, now.

819
01:54:49,674 --> 01:54:51,843
I didn't shoot him to save you.

820
01:54:53,387 --> 01:54:56,348
I saved those 17 RAW agents.

821
01:54:56,807 --> 01:54:59,184
-What do you mean?
-Your life is still in danger.

822
01:55:01,186 --> 01:55:02,187
What are you doing?

823
01:55:05,023 --> 01:55:06,566
You must fix everything
that Rudra's mother

824
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:08,819
and the rest of the RAW
agent's family had to go through.

825
01:55:09,277 --> 01:55:10,195
What do you mean?

826
01:55:10,612 --> 01:55:13,865
I've done my duty, now. You do yours.

827
01:55:22,749 --> 01:55:23,708
Do it, sir.

828
01:55:25,710 --> 01:55:27,546
He's off the rails. He will kill you.

829
01:55:34,261 --> 01:55:37,764
The government has taken
a very important step today.

830
01:55:38,265 --> 01:55:41,768
Those RAW agents who
were deemed as traitors,

831
01:55:41,977 --> 01:55:44,229
their names are being cleared.

832
01:55:46,148 --> 01:55:47,023
Yes.

833
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:50,902
We ordered an inquiry
which led us to the understanding

834
01:55:50,986 --> 01:55:54,239
that those RAW agents were not traitors.

835
01:55:54,823 --> 01:55:57,117
In addition to clearing their names,

836
01:55:57,325 --> 01:55:59,327
<i>we will also compensate their families.</i>

837
01:55:59,453 --> 01:56:05,792
<i>Karan Pratap Singh, Harish Chaturvedi,</i>
<i>Suraj Rawat, Arshad Khan, Manjeet Singh,</i>

838
01:56:06,001 --> 01:56:10,463
<i>Rahul Rajput, Mahesh Deshpande,</i>
<i>and many more patriots like them</i>

839
01:56:10,547 --> 01:56:13,175
<i>laid down their lives for this country.</i>

840
01:56:14,092 --> 01:56:18,430
Tonight, their families will be lighting
a lamp in their homes in your name.

841
01:56:18,763 --> 01:56:23,101
Well, those RAW agents did their duty
and I'm just doing mine.

842
01:56:23,268 --> 01:56:25,020
Don't forget, you're watching...

843
01:56:34,279 --> 01:56:36,907
You finally learnt how to use your heart
along with your head.

844
01:56:39,743 --> 01:56:43,246
-By the way, she's nice.
-Who?

845
01:56:44,122 --> 01:56:45,123
Who are you talking to?

846
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:49,669
You're watching <i>The Voice of Truth,</i>

847
01:56:49,753 --> 01:56:53,006
and with us is the HRD Minister,
Brijesh Verma...

848
01:56:53,173 --> 01:56:54,048
No-one.

849
01:56:54,132 --> 01:56:56,885
...who has raised his voice
in support of our RAW Agents.

850
01:56:57,093 --> 01:56:59,346
And his voice is echoing
all over the country.

851
01:56:59,513 --> 01:57:01,515
So, the Minister finally found a way.

852
01:57:11,441 --> 01:57:12,484
Take care of yourself.

853
01:57:13,985 --> 01:57:18,948
And for the first time, our government
hasn't just restored their honor,

854
01:57:19,032 --> 01:57:21,034
but also their identity.

855
01:57:21,409 --> 01:57:24,204
Our country is really changing.

856
01:57:44,432 --> 01:57:46,017
I don't get it.

857
01:57:47,435 --> 01:57:49,062
Why do only good people die?

858
01:57:50,313 --> 01:57:52,148
Why do bad things happen to the good?

859
01:57:53,817 --> 01:57:55,569
Those who should be crying are laughing.

860
01:57:56,403 --> 01:57:58,113
Those who should be laughing are crying.

861
01:57:58,905 --> 01:58:00,574
I've had enough of this.

862
01:58:01,408 --> 01:58:03,159
I've stayed silent for too long.

863
01:58:04,327 --> 01:58:08,248
Now, listen to the uproar in my heart.
Listen to my intentions.

864
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:10,791
<i>Obsession is my nature</i>

865
01:58:10,875 --> 01:58:12,919
<i>It's stubborn and I am high on it</i>

866
01:58:13,003 --> 01:58:17,173
<i>And only I know where you belong</i>

867
01:58:17,257 --> 01:58:19,133
<i>The game you just played...</i>

868
01:58:19,217 --> 01:58:21,219
<i>You're going to lose</i>

869
01:58:21,303 --> 01:58:23,262
<i>How long are you going to</i>

870
01:58:23,346 --> 01:58:25,473
<i>Throw stones at</i>
<i>Us thinking we're glass</i>

871
01:58:25,557 --> 01:58:27,517
<i>It's boiling in every vein</i>

872
01:58:27,601 --> 01:58:29,685
<i>Listen up, it's saying...</i>

873
01:58:29,769 --> 01:58:33,982
<i>It's going insane...</i>

874
01:58:35,191 --> 01:58:37,318
<i>The color red... red</i>

875
01:58:37,402 --> 01:58:39,403
<i>The color red... red</i>

876
01:58:39,487 --> 01:58:43,533
<i>The color red... red</i>

877
01:58:43,617 --> 01:58:45,743
<i>The color red... red</i>

878
01:58:45,827 --> 01:58:47,787
<i>The color red... red</i>

879
01:58:47,871 --> 01:58:51,916
<i>The color red... red</i>

880
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,085
<i>The color red... red</i>

881
01:58:54,169 --> 01:58:56,254
<i>The color red... red</i>

882
01:58:56,338 --> 01:59:01,009
<i>The color red... red</i>

883
01:59:18,568 --> 01:59:19,694
The country has changed.

884
01:59:20,862 --> 01:59:22,280
Everything has changed.

885
01:59:23,239 --> 01:59:24,532
If you slap us once...

886
01:59:25,408 --> 01:59:26,868
we'll slap back 1,000 times.

887
01:59:28,119 --> 01:59:32,040
If you try to intimidate us,
we will rip you apart.

888
01:59:33,208 --> 01:59:36,336
We promise you, our force promises you.

889
01:59:36,711 --> 01:59:38,713
<i>Every bullet in my gun</i>

890
01:59:38,797 --> 01:59:40,881
<i>Has your name on it</i>

891
01:59:40,965 --> 01:59:43,009
<i>We won't miss our aim this time</i>

892
01:59:43,093 --> 01:59:45,094
<i>We're determined</i>

893
01:59:45,178 --> 01:59:49,307
<i>We never bow, nor</i>
<i>Can we ever betray</i>

894
01:59:49,391 --> 01:59:53,394
<i>We will blow you away</i>
<i>We are ready</i>

895
01:59:53,478 --> 01:59:55,605
<i>It's boiling in every vein</i>

896
01:59:55,689 --> 01:59:57,648
<i>Listen up, it's saying...</i>

897
01:59:57,732 --> 02:00:01,861
<i>It's going insane...</i>

898
02:00:03,238 --> 02:00:05,406
<i>The color red... red</i>

899
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:07,450
<i>The color red... red</i>

900
02:00:07,534 --> 02:00:11,495
<i>The color red... red</i>

901
02:00:11,579 --> 02:00:13,831
<i>The color red... red</i>

902
02:00:13,915 --> 02:00:15,916
<i>The color red... red</i>

903
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,837
<i>The color red... red</i>

904
02:00:19,921 --> 02:00:22,131
<i>The color red... red</i>

905
02:00:22,215 --> 02:00:24,216
<i>The color red... red</i>

906
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:28,512
<i>The color red... red</i>

907
02:00:28,596 --> 02:00:30,598
<i>The color red... red</i>

908
02:00:30,682 --> 02:00:32,683
<i>The color red... red</i>

909
02:00:32,767 --> 02:00:36,813
<i>The color red... red</i>

910
02:00:37,230 --> 02:00:38,648
Force is a persistent feeling.

911
02:00:39,149 --> 02:00:41,568
It's an emotion. It's an obsession.

912
02:00:42,152 --> 02:00:43,236
It's our pride.

913
02:00:44,112 --> 02:00:45,530
Force is a retaliation.

914
02:00:46,322 --> 02:00:47,574
It's insanity.

915
02:00:48,283 --> 02:00:51,119
It's martyrdom. It's a craze.

916
02:00:51,995 --> 02:00:53,371
Force is a voice.

917
02:00:54,330 --> 02:00:56,791
It's your voice. It's my voice.

918
02:00:57,667 --> 02:00:59,127
It's our voice.

919
02:00:59,627 --> 02:01:02,297
If we all scream together...

920
02:01:03,089 --> 02:01:05,300
the world will have to listen.

921
02:01:06,050 --> 02:01:07,051
<i>So, scream.</i>
