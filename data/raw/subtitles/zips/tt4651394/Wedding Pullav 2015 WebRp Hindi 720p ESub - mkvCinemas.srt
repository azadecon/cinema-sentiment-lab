1
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,750
Decorate the venue. Eat some sweets.

2
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,750
Shake a leg with the guests.

3
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,500
Whether it's your uncle.. or your aunt.

4
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,370
Invite all your guests.

5
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,370
Let the hearts unite.

6
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,160
And throw a feast.

7
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,500
Eat yourself and also treat others to..

8
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,250
The Wedding Pulav.

9
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,250
The Wedding Pulav.

10
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,250
The Wedding Pulav.

11
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,120
The Wedding Pulav.

12
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,790
Decorate the palanquin.. and the horse.

13
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,410
Play the music out loud.

14
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:20,370
Get a picture taken with the bride-groom.

15
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,750
Raise the volume.. and make everyone sway.

16
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,040
Play this song again.

17
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,540
The Wedding Pulav.

18
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,290
The Wedding Pulav.

19
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,870
The Wedding Pulav.

20
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,870
The Wedding Pulav.

21
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,000
The Wedding Pulav.

22
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,790
Pammi. - Yeah, Shammi.

23
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,290
I heard that Aditya and Riya are having a love-marriage.

24
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,250
I heard that too.

25
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,620
You see, Aditya designs bikes.

26
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,750
And Riya's father produces bikes.

27
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,620
Then it's definitely a love marriage. - Of course.

28
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,910
Hello.

29
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,160
Hello.

30
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,540
Sweety. - Hello, Pammi..

31
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,500
Hello, Shammi.

32
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,160
Congratulations.

33
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,410
Thank you very much.

34
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,120
Have you seen Aditya's father around?

35
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,870
I've been looking all over for him.

36
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,750
If a Punjabi is missing for a long time..

37
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,500
..then you should go look at the bar.

38
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,870
That's where one can normally find them.

39
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,410
It's the pride of Punjabis.

40
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,000
Absolutely right.

41
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,120
I'll go take a look.

42
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,620
You enjoy yourself. - Yeah.

43
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,540
Go find him.

44
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,660
Make a large one.

45
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,790
Mr. Sodhi. - Mr. Khurana..

46
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,750
My near and dear.. Mr. Khurana.

47
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,250
Congratulations.

48
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,370
Aditya has made us very proud.

49
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,870
Thank you. Thank you. After all he's my son.

50
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,790
Whose son is he? - He's my son.

51
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,000
Dimpy? - Yeah.

52
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,500
Hello, son. - Greetings, uncle.

53
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,290
Bless you.

54
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,000
Currently he's into garments' business.

55
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,500
He's doing very well. - I see.

56
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,250
Son, what car are you driving these days? - The S-Class, uncle.

57
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,120
Strange.

58
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,750
You're the son of a A-class father..

59
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,370
..and still stuck on S-Class.

60
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,160
We used to have an S-Class.

61
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,160
But my beautiful wife.. - Hello.

62
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,500
Here she comes.

63
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,750
My very beautiful, hot, sexy wife said..

64
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,910
..buy a bigger car.

65
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,370
And son I bought two Q7s.

66
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,540
I see. - I don't know why.

67
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,410
Just a minute. - Only one minute.

68
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,620
What are you doing?

69
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,660
Can't you see? I am socializing.

70
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,620
This isn't socializing, it's called making tall claims.

71
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,660
Sweety, I am not making tall claims.

72
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,620
We do own a Q7.

73
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,660
They're not going to come home..

74
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,000
..and check whether we've two Q7s or not.

75
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,620
You are.. - What?

76
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,910
Just too much. - Too much what?

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,500
Forget it. - Why should I forget it?

78
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,540
Carry on then.

79
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,250
Sweety!

80
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,290
Papa, loosen up.

81
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,000
Mr. Kumar.

82
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,500
My near and dear.. Mr. Kumar.

83
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,660
How are you? - Fine, until now.

84
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,250
And you'll stay fine.

85
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,500
Hi, dear. - Hi, aunty.

86
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,870
Oh my.. she's looking so lovely.

87
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,250
Thank you, aunty.

88
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,500
Aunty, where's Adi?

89
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,790
Guys, how am I looking?

90
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,000
Adi, you're looking.. just like yourself.

91
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,750
Go ahead and laugh, you rascals.

92
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,750
Every dog has his day.. you will too.

93
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,160
I don't want a day.

94
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,790
I'm only waiting for my wedding night.

95
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,910
And you'll be eating on your wedding night.

96
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,120
And nothing else.

97
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,540
Nonsense.

98
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,370
It's okay, buddy, forget it.

99
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,660
Chill. Look.. he's wearing the wrong shoes.

100
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,000
Sorry.. sorry..

101
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,790
Don't vent your anger on us, bro.

102
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,120
Yeah, this is not fair.

103
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,910
I'll get engaged in 10 minutes.

104
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,370
And there's no clue of Lambu anywhere around.

105
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,790
You all better do something for me. - Yeah..

106
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,370
Listen, stop fighting.

107
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,750
I'll go down and find out.

108
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,500
Chill.

109
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,410
Hello.

110
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,870
Riya. - Mom!

111
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,870
I am so happy to see you, mom.

112
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,750
I wouldn't have missed this for anything, dear.

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,870
Mom, not fair. - What?

114
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,120
It's my engagement..

115
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,750
..and you're looking better than me.

116
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,750
That's not fair. - Silly girl.

117
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,040
Papa, mom's here.

118
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,910
Hi.

119
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,620
Hi.

120
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,250
By the way, you're looking nice. - Thanks.

121
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,500
Let's take a picture.

122
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,040
No Riya, really.. - Come on, mama.

123
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,160
Papa, come.

124
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,000
Come closer, nice.

125
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,290
Bit lower.

126
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,660
Let's all smile.

127
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,250
I looked everywhere, she isn't here.

128
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,910
There's no point.

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,500
The flight landed two hours ago.

130
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,620
And her phone's switched off.

131
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,620
Everyone's waiting, I must go now.

132
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,120
But one thing's for sure.

133
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,910
If I get engaged without Lambu.. she won't spare me.

134
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,620
Band?

135
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,370
Lambu!

136
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,540
Lambu!

137
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,870
Lambu!

138
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,500
Lambu!

139
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,620
Lambu!

140
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,660
Lambu!

141
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,910
Lambu!

142
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,370
Lambu!

143
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,870
Come on, me too.

144
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,040
Lambu!

145
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,870
Lambu!

146
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,620
Bloody rascal, you were getting engaged without me.

147
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,500
Two minutes more.. and you would've missed my engagement.

148
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,870
I said I'll come.. then I'll definitely come.

149
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,160
Thank God you're here.

150
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,500
Where are aunty and Gulabo?

151
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,500
If I had waited for them, I would've arrived tomorrow.

152
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,660
Yeah! - Forget that.. How was my entry?

153
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,250
Just like you..

154
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,910
Amazing!

155
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,660
Adi's best friend. Anushka.

156
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,160
Just came from London. In Business Class.

157
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,120
Anushka. I am so happy to finally see you.

158
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,790
Oh my, God! You're really hot, huh.

159
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,620
Well.. I know.

160
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,620
And she's got a good sense of humor too.

161
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,500
Wow.. you really got lucky.

162
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,160
Adi, today is your engagement.

163
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,660
I hope you remember.

164
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,120
Adi!

165
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,370
Wow!

166
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,910
Congratulations, dear.

167
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,500
Cut the cake.

168
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,250
Don't be scared.

169
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,120
Cut it. Go for it.

170
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,290
Hold on.

171
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,620
Anushka, this is the office.

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,160
That's the pantry.

173
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,250
And I'll show you Adi's cabin. - Yeah.

174
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,750
Come.

175
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,910
Welcome. - Wow!

176
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,040
Nice, isn't it?

177
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,250
Adi, I am really impressed.

178
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,160
Let me show you something.

179
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,750
Have a look at the best looking bike ever to hit the Indian roads.

180
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,370
Four-Stroke, Single Cylinder. DTSi Engine.

181
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,410
450cc Displacement.

182
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,620
It's the lightest and most powerful bike in its segment..

183
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,120
..and the most economical.

184
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,540
With a mileage of 45 km/L.. in city conditions.

185
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,620
And to top it all.. it's the most affordable thing.

186
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,620
It's not a bike, it's a phenomenon!

187
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,250
And that's what we call it.

188
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Phenomenon.

189
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,620
Wow Adi, that's amazing!

190
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,870
Did you understand anything?

191
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,870
Yeah. - What?

192
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,790
You're the luckiest guy in the world.

193
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,410
You've a hot bike.. and a hotter wife.

194
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,370
Sir; there's a conference-call for you.

195
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,910
Excuse me. - Bye.

196
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,620
Riya. - Yes.

197
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,790
I just want to say thank you.

198
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,870
You fulfilled all my friend's dreams. - No, no, no..

199
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,620
Don't thank me.

200
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,500
It's all because of you.

201
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,870
Because of me? - Yes.

202
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,750
Why?

203
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,910
Well.. Adi told me, that you locked him in his room..

204
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,870
..on the day of his MBA exam.

205
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,410
Are you serious? He told you that.

206
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,120
If you hadn't done that..

207
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,370
..then he would be doing some boring job right now.

208
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,620
He wouldn't have designed the bike.. or come in my life.

209
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,370
So thanks to you.

210
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,370
Are you two going to share all the credits..

211
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,790
..or leave something for me too?

212
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,870
Papa.

213
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,290
Hi, dear. - Hi, uncle.

214
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:27,750
Hello.

215
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,540
The entire credit goes to you.

216
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,790
You gave Adi the biggest opportunity of his life.

217
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,120
Well..

218
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,660
Hello, sir. - Hello, young man.

219
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,540
By the way, when is the bike's launch date?

220
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,660
This bike will be launched right after Adi and Riya's marriage.

221
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,160
And this will be my wedding present to both of them.

222
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,620
You're coming to the wedding, aren't you?

223
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,540
Uncle, if I don't dance in front of his mare..

224
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,620
..he won't get married.

225
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,500
Funny girl.

226
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,370
Enjoy yourselves. - Okay, bye.

227
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,910
It's a message from mom.

228
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,250
She wants me to have lunch with her.

229
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,790
Do you have to go? - Yes, Adi.

230
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,750
Mom's here only for few days.

231
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,870
I'll have to go. I want to go.

232
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,540
I'll see you later.

233
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,750
Bye. - Bye.

234
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,870
Adi.

235
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,250
Don't be so sad.

236
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,040
She's going to be yours forever.

237
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,250
Listen.. how about we go get some?

238
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,870
Come on.

239
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,750
So what's new?

240
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,790
So good, dude.

241
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,910
Another one.

242
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,910
Did you like Riya?

243
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,660
If I say no, will you cancel the wedding?

244
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,120
Of course I like her.

245
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,290
She's beautiful, she loves you.

246
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,370
And most importantly.. she's fulfilling your dream.

247
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,620
Really?

248
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,120
I am very lucky.

249
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,250
What?

250
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,910
Riya's turned you into a dude.

251
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,870
You're eating roadside snacks in a tie.

252
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,250
Hero..

253
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,620
What did you do?

254
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,250
You spoiled my dress.

255
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,040
I bought this especially for today.

256
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,620
Brother, please give me some water.

257
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,500
Sweet or sour?

258
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,870
Idiots, don't laugh.

259
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,120
It's my birthday dress.

260
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,910
When was your birthday? - Today's my birthday, you fool.

261
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,910
Why do you think..

262
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,290
..I'm decked up like Lady Diana since morning? - Sorry.. sorry.. sorry.

263
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,290
Happy birthday to you.

264
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,370
Happy birthday..

265
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,370
Alright guys.

266
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,120
For a similar situation Sri Sri Amitabh Bachchan has quoted.

267
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,120
This calls for a party.

268
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,040
Party!

269
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,750
Party!

270
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,290
Party!

271
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,910
Party!

272
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,500
Hey.. hey.. what's it going to be?

273
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,160
If the beat's hot, then it's made for me.

274
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,620
Two pegs couldn't satisfy my heart.

275
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,500
Let's drink some more and get high.

276
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,290
Two pegs couldn't satisfy my heart.

277
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,620
Let's drink some more and get high.

278
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:34,120
We'll be getting some shots and making cocktails.

279
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,290
We want to get high and do what we want.

280
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,000
Let's jump.. and shout.

281
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,620
And put your.. put your hands up.

282
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,910
I want to empty all the bottles.

283
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,540
I want to party.

284
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,000
I want to empty all the bottles.

285
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,750
I want to party.

286
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,910
Let's bring the moon down.

287
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,750
So it can dance with us too.

288
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,000
We wake up late in the morning..

289
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,500
..and start drinking right again.

290
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,370
We're going to dance and sway.

291
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Even if we fall down.. but we'll get up and dance again.

292
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,750
We're going to blow the champagne..

293
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,120
..and let the beer flow.

294
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,500
The youth wants to get a little crazy.

295
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,120
Let's jump.. and shout.

296
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,790
And put your.. put your hands up.

297
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,000
I want to empty all the bottles.

298
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,620
I want to party.

299
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,160
I want to empty all the bottles.

300
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,750
I want to party.

301
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,540
Bottles are empty yet I am not high enough.

302
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,540
I just want to feel nice-nice.

303
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,790
Less sugar.. more spice-spice.

304
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,620
Gosh.. shots are making me full tight.

305
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,790
Make every night-Saturday night.

306
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,250
Yes.. it's my wish.

307
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,910
I just want to party hard.

308
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,290
My friends are right here.. the mood's all set.

309
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,790
This is the moment to have fun.

310
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,120
We're going to remember this moment.. even tomorrow.

311
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,870
Now that's a dialogue at the right time.

312
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,660
Our emotions are on a high.

313
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,790
Drink and let drink.. that's our only slogan.

314
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,750
We're going to celebrate.

315
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,250
Get closer to friends.

316
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,540
We want to keep partying all our lives.

317
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,160
Let's jump.. and shout.

318
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,750
And put your.. put your hands up.

319
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,750
I want to empty all the bottles.

320
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,750
I want to empty all the bottles.

321
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,370
Yeah, hello.

322
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,750
Oh.. hi Jay, how exciting.

323
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,660
Hey.. who are you talking to? - Jay.

324
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,870
Jay who? - My boyfriend.

325
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,620
What's she saying?

326
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,660
She says.. she's talking to some boyfriend.

327
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,160
Her boyfriend? - Yeah.

328
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,620
She's drunk.

329
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,620
I want to empty all the bottles.

330
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,790
I want to party.

331
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,120
Look at these.. offspring's of the Internet.

332
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,870
I drink too.. but I never get knocked out.

333
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,790
I know it all.

334
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:49,250
I've cleaned your puke so many times.

335
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,290
Batli.. what about you?

336
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:58,250
Find a girl yet? - No, Gulabo.

337
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,620
Girls are losing their sense of taste.

338
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,370
They don't like decent boys.

339
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,120
Forget girls, even boys are losing taste.

340
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,620
Better be careful. - Thank you.

341
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,870
Or some boy might fall for you.

342
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,870
Oh granny..

343
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,620
All the oldies think about God in the morning.

344
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,910
And listen to the things you're saying.

345
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,540
Who are you calling old?

346
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,500
I'm in my golden years.

347
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,540
Golden years.

348
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,500
Come on.. come down and have your breakfast.

349
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,870
Congratulations. Get up.

350
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,370
Good morning.

351
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,790
I don't want your wishes. - Why?

352
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,910
Why didn't you and granny show up?

353
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,870
Two days ago granny had too many kebabs for starters.

354
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,120
She had a bad stomach.

355
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,290
How could I have left her?

356
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,620
By the way, dude.. I've heard that the girl's really cute.

357
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:48,910
Gulabo.. my girl's really cute, but your girl's spoilt.

358
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,370
Last night she was so high that..

359
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,620
..she was telling us about her boyfriend.

360
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,870
She was right.

361
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,000
Didn't you tell them about Jay?

362
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,410
I was about to tell them, but then..

363
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,870
Fine, tell them later.

364
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,910
Now get up.. I made stuffed bread for everyone.

365
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Come down and get your breakfast.

366
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,000
Get up.. come on, hurry up.

367
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,250
What's..

368
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,370
I mean.. what's all this about?

369
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,500
So.. I and Jay have been dating for few months.

370
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,120
You really have a boyfriend? - Yeah!

371
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,250
Wow!

372
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,500
Why are you so excited?

373
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,500
Do you guys want to meet him? - Yeah.

374
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,250
Come on.

375
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,500
Oh no.. I can't face Jay like this.

376
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,870
I haven't even washed my face yet.

377
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,000
You won't look any better even if you do.

378
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,040
Just shut up.

379
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,040
I'll just be back.

380
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,870
Hello.

381
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,500
Well, I was expecting Anushka.

382
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,750
So you're the gang, right? - Yes.

383
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,870
Anushka's told me about everyone.

384
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,750
So wait.. you're Petha. - Of course.

385
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,910
Batlu. - Yes.

386
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,000
And you're the gorgeous Nikki, right?

387
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,790
Oh.. thanks, Jay.

388
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,370
We were all really excited to meet you.

389
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,910
You know.. - Where's Adi?

390
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,870
Hey, brother. How are you doing?

391
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,000
How was the engagement?

392
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,000
It was nice. - Good.

393
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,620
And Batli.. still a virgin.

394
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,750
My virginity's famous in London as well.

395
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,540
I haven't found anyone yet, Jay.

396
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,500
You will..

397
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,120
Jay, are you done with?

398
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,910
No, no, stay there.. I'll join you in a minute.

399
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,870
Okay.

400
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,750
Move.

401
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,870
Hi, baby. - Hey, sweetheart.

402
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,000
How are you? - I am good.. and I'm having a blast with my friends.

403
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,620
But I am really missing you.

404
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,250
I miss you too.

405
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,620
When are you coming back? - Really, really, really soon.

406
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,660
Alright, Sweety.. I got to finish some work.

407
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,120
So I'll talk later, okay? - Yeah, no problem.

408
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,160
Love you. - Love you too.

409
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,750
Bye. - Bye, darling. See you.

410
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,250
Come on, guys, let's go.

411
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,620
So how was Jay?

412
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:02,040
I know.. he's not exactly Tom Cruise, but he's really nice.

413
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,120
And.. - There was a nude girl in his room.

414
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,370
What? - Honestly.

415
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,790
We all saw it. - Yes, Lambu. She was nude.

416
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,370
I mean she was completely nude.

417
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,620
She saw her too.

418
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,500
On one side.. he was saying "Love you baby, miss you baby"..

419
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,410
..and on the other side "Wait I am not finished yet".

420
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,120
Why are you all laughing?

421
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,750
Tell them.

422
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,370
Guys, just chill.

423
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,160
Jay is a painter. - So? So?

424
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,620
And his specialty is nude paintings.

425
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,870
The girl you saw in his room.. must be some model.

426
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,250
Ohh.. I see.

427
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:46,120
Granny, do you like a guy.. who paints nude girls?

428
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:50,000
Son.. we're satisfied that he's a boy.

429
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,620
Why are you over-reacting?

430
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,870
That's Jay's profession.

431
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,370
And anyway, he's Lambu's boyfriend, not yours.

432
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,370
And she's not married to him.

433
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,410
Well.. I haven't yet, but we're going to?

434
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,620
Really? Are you serious?

435
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,910
Adi, why don't you invite Jay to your wedding?

436
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,870
We'll have loads of fun.

437
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I say.. let's get Anushka and Jay married as well.

438
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,160
She barely likes any boy.

439
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,750
Now finally she likes someone.

440
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,910
If we delay.. she'll change her mind again.

441
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,870
Granny.. what are you saying?

442
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,500
This isn't the way to get married.

443
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,250
You never planned for anything before. - Of course.

444
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,790
Adi, it's a very good idea.

445
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,250
And we're all going to be there.

446
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,540
And.. we'll invite Jay and his family.

447
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,910
You don't worry.

448
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,410
Yeah, no need to worry.

449
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,870
Son, Jay doesn't have a family.

450
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,870
Then talk to Jay directly.

451
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,370
Talk to him now..Talk to him now.

452
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,500
Nice.

453
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,250
Talk to him now.

454
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,910
Riya.. there's a slight change of plan.

455
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,250
What? Are you marrying someone else?

456
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,120
You won't get away so easily.

457
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,870
You know, Anushka has a boyfriend.

458
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,910
Jay.

459
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,750
You know, these guys are so crazy..

460
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,870
..they're saying call Jay here and get married.

461
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,620
Crazy.. idea.

462
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,910
Yes, Adi, I think it's a fabulous idea.

463
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,250
But it's not a bad idea. - Jay.

464
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,790
In fact, it's a great idea.

465
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,540
If you were in front of me..

466
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,750
..then once again I would've gone on my knees..

467
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,290
..and asked you..

468
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,370
Will you marry me, Anushka?

469
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,620
Hey listen..

470
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,540
Riya loved the idea.

471
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,410
Congratulations. - Awesome.

472
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,540
Congratulations.

473
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,000
Guys, Jay didn't like the idea. - Why.

474
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,540
In fact, he loved it.

475
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,120
Really?.. Yes!

476
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,660
So Adi and Anushka will tie the knot..

477
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,120
In Thailand!

478
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,160
Granny.. in Thailand.

479
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,750
Granny.. move.. it's an emergency.

480
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,870
Drink.

481
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
All the way you kept saying "it's an emergency".

482
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,250
And now you're drinking.

483
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,910
It's a welcome drink.

484
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,870
You're just.. - What?

485
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,250
You're too much. - What?

486
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,120
Forget it. - Why?

487
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,250
Carry on then.

488
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,790
Wife's angry.

489
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,870
Now that's Thailand.

490
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,540
Vodka.. at the arrival.

491
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,500
Oh my, God. Let's go for shopping.

492
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,000
Ohhh.. it's a virgin.

493
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,120
Granny.. can you tell by looking at it? - No.

494
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,500
It's the smell.

495
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,910
I think I'll have to arrange for myself.

496
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,160
The rest of the arrangements are in your room, ma'am.

497
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,620
You will find the best liquors in the world in your mini-bar.

498
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,410
I am General Manager of the Hotel, Luvinder Kapoor.

499
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,410
You can call me Luv Kapoor. My card.

500
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,620
Gulabo. - What?

501
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,120
My name.

502
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,120
Welcome to the JW Marriot, please.

503
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,250
Thank you.

504
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,120
I hope there are no chances of Tsunami. - No, no.

505
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,120
I am so happy you came. - I'm so happy to be here.

506
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,160
Excuse me, sir.

507
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,370
You must be the groom, Aditya. - Yes.

508
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,750
Nice to meet you. - Same here.

509
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,750
And of course, you must be the bride.

510
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,250
She's a bride, but of a different groom.

511
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,790
I am Adi's bride.

512
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,870
I am sorry. I am terribly sorry.

513
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,500
I was deceived.

514
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,500
It's okay.

515
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,120
Actually, we're best friends.

516
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,750
My groom Jay will arrive tomorrow. - Lovely.

517
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,500
Well, I hope you have a comfortable stay till then.

518
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,540
Sure. - Thank you.

519
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,250
Right. - Thank you.

520
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,000
Sir.. - Yes.

521
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,500
Do you have sandwich massage?

522
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,040
Excuse me?

523
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:57,370
Well young man, we've sandwiches in the room service.

524
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,250
And we've massage in the Spa.

525
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,620
So.. enjoy.

526
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,290
Stupid. - It was just a thought, so I asked him.

527
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,870
Come in.

528
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,120
Please keep it here. - Okay, sir.

529
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,620
Hey.

530
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,000
Hi.

531
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,870
Wait, wait, wait.. what are you doing?

532
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,750
Taking a bath. - Meaning?

533
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,000
Taking a bath.

534
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,620
You can join me.

535
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,250
Why are you taking a bath in my room?

536
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,370
Why not?

537
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,160
Are you thinking you will stay in my room?

538
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,370
Of course.

539
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,910
No way.

540
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,120
Take your luggage and get out.

541
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,290
But, Riya.. - Are you crazy?

542
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,660
Mom and dad will be here any minute.

543
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,870
I am going to marry their daughter. - Yes..

544
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,410
We still have a few days left.

545
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,910
After that, you can stay as long as you want.

546
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,870
But now just go.

547
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,290
Why are you behaving like this with your future husband?

548
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,750
I am behaving the way I should.

549
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,250
Adi. - Fine, I am going.

550
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,120
At least give me a kiss before I go. - No, Adi.

551
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,290
Just go.

552
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,750
What's this? - What?

553
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,790
Adi.. !

554
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,250
You're so.. cute.

555
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,750
Where is it?

556
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,790
Sweety, where's the flush?

557
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,910
These days they've sensors.

558
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,410
Wave your hand under the tap and the water comes out.

559
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,250
But what do I wave here?

560
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,000
My head.

561
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,000
Oh, God.. what did you give me?

562
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,290
Coming.

563
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,040
You're just.. - What?

564
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,120
Too much.

565
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,410
Sensor. Sensor. - Yeah, sensor.

566
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
What are you two doing in the bathroom together?

567
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,500
We're playing a game, but you should've knocked before coming in.

568
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,790
Why? You two are not on a honeymoon here..

569
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,910
..that you'll get disturbed.

570
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,120
Listen to that..

571
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,660
He isn't even married yet, and he's already got questions.

572
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,120
I wonder what's going to happen after the marriage.

573
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,870
He's my son.

574
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,910
He'll do good even after the marriage.

575
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,540
Look, Adi.. your father-in-law might be..

576
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,620
..a big manufacturer of motorcycles.

577
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,000
But we Sodhis are no less.

578
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,290
Your father's absolutely right.

579
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,040
Don't be scared of Riya.

580
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,750
Mom.. I am not a coward like papa.

581
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,160
Naughty. - Adi, you're feeling really brave now..

582
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,290
..but by the time your honeymoon's over, you'll be tamed..

583
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,620
..or else you can change my name.

584
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:25,120
By the way.. this is a really romantic place.

585
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,660
So.. - I say we should not waste any time.

586
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,120
It's the modern age..

587
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,370
Bed her.. before the marriage.

588
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,750
Riya doesn't like these things, papa.

589
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,870
This means you've been thinking about it.

590
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:43,250
That's like a Sodhi. Give me a hug, son.

591
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,370
What are you teaching your son?

592
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,620
I am teaching him something I couldn't learn myself.

593
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,750
Come on, family hug.

594
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,120
You're too much.

595
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:08,910
Gulabo.. - What are you doing?

596
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:14,250
I am so excited, I never thought I'll get married so quickly.

597
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:17,870
Yeah.. looking at your actions, it's hard to say you're getting married.

598
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,790
Tell me something.. have you finished preparing.

599
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,370
You're missing mom-dad too, aren't you?

600
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,120
I am missing them too.

601
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:46,910
You know.. if they were here, they would've been so excited.. - Why?

602
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,620
Did I leave any void, dear?

603
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,750
No, Gulabo?

604
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,910
So tell me.. do you remember..

605
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,160
..who was your first childhood friend?

606
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,500
You!

607
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,120
And who endured your tantrums?

608
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
You did, Gulabo!

609
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:15,250
And remember, who made you taste whiskey first?

610
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,250
Of course, it can only be you.

611
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,040
I am sorry.

612
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,410
You're the best.

613
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:29,500
Look, don't ever say such things again and hurt me.

614
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
When my heart aches, I need my medicine.

615
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,120
What? What medicine?

616
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,120
Oh my, God.. Gulabo, you're too much.

617
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,620
You want.

618
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:52,000
Punjabi folk song.

619
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,290
I love all this, so pretty.

620
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:59,040
Listen.. was your Ravinder always like this..

621
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,000
..or did he become like this now?

622
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,000
What do you mean?

623
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:06,410
Don't mind.. but he looks a bit lusty to me.

624
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:13,790
I doubt.. he troubled you a lot on your first night.

625
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,620
Tell me the truth.

626
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,370
No, no.. he couldn't do a thing. - Why? Was he drunk?

627
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,120
No, no.. when he came to me at night, I started crying.

628
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,620
I said 'I am missing my mom'.

629
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,120
He kept cajoling me all night.

630
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,540
No wonder he's been venting his wedding night frustration till now.

631
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,370
Granny, you're just..

632
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,370
Granny, it must be different during your time, isn't it?

633
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,120
I mean.. did people go on honeymoon?

634
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,870
We never went anywhere.

635
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,620
We would do it at every opportunity we got.

636
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,620
You're too much, granny. - She's just too much.

637
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:54,910
Oh my, God! They're so openly talking about their honeymoon.

638
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:59,620
Like.. I'm not going to tell them.. what will happen on my honeymoon.

639
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,910
Oh really.. as if we don't know..

640
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,290
..what's going to happen on your honeymoon.

641
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:05,790
Sorry.

642
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:06,750
Sweety. - Yes.

643
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:09,500
Where did you go on your honeymoon? - I went to Goa.

644
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,500
What did you see?

645
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,620
I didn't see anything in Goa? - Why?

646
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,000
I just saw the ceiling fan and came back.

647
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:32,910
Guys, I've a really exciting plan for today. - What?

648
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,000
What are you planning without me?

649
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,120
You're also part of it.

650
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,620
We're all going.. deep-sea diving.

651
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,000
Wow.. - Nice.

652
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,620
One minute. I can't come.

653
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,540
Why? - Why?

654
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,370
I'm scared of deep water.

655
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,120
I am scared of the sea, Adi. - What?

656
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,620
Adi, you didn't know Riya's scared of deep water.

657
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,910
We don't bathe together that I would know.

658
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,120
I am sorry, Riya.

659
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:02,620
Come on, we'll be together. - No, no, no.

660
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,660
Are you sure? - Yes, baby.

661
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,370
You guys go. And you guys have lots of fun. - Yes.

662
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,870
I'll see you later.

663
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,910
Bye. - Bye.

664
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,660
Come soon, I'll get Anushka and see you guys.

665
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,040
Done.

666
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:25,500
Anushka, where are you?

667
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,620
I've just come into the lobby.

668
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,870
I am in the lobby as well.

669
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,870
Are you okay?

670
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,500
Are you okay?

671
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,620
Yeah.

672
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:59,750
Then hang up.

673
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,870
Ma'am, your car is ready. - Thank you.

674
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,290
Anushka - What?

675
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,120
Are you going somewhere? - Yes.

676
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,250
I made plans for deep-sea diving, with you.

677
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,750
The entire gang's waiting.

678
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,620
I can't come. I'm going to pick up Jay.

679
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,000
Oh..you're looking really hot. - Thank you.

680
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,370
Yeah, Anushka..you're looking like a woman. - Hey..

681
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,120
But how are you going to jump in the water in these clothes?

682
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,660
She isn't jumping in the water. - Why?

683
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,370
She's not coming with us.

684
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,370
What? - Why?

685
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
What do you mean? Jay's coming.

686
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,250
I am going to the airport to pick him up.

687
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,160
Let's send a car to pick up Jay.

688
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,540
Jay's coming here to marry me, not the car.

689
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,910
Anushka isn't coming either. Nor is Riya.

690
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,620
Idea! Why don't we all go pick up Jay?

691
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,750
What an idea?

692
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,870
Anushka, do you mind?

693
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,620
Of course I mind.

694
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,290
We don't care. - Come on, guys, let's go.

695
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:01,120
We'll never break this friendship.

696
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,790
We'll give up..

697
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,620
What's that?

698
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,410
Anushka, turn left.. turn left.

699
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,250
What's that board? - I don't know.

700
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,410
It has your name written on it.

701
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,910
Are you guys playing some kind of prank on me? - No way.

702
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,870
What can be a bigger prank than you getting married.

703
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,040
I think we should find out.

704
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,910
Yeah, let's go.

705
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,250
Something's definitely wrong.

706
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:22,250
First left, now right. What's going on here?

707
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,250
Anushka, turn left.

708
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:26,750
So many balloons.

709
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,370
Something's definitely wrong.

710
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:35,790
Jay! Oh my God.

711
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,870
Get down.

712
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,750
Batli, get down.

713
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,660
Jay. - Anushka.

714
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,750
When did you get so filmy?

715
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,870
My God..this is so special.

716
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,660
It is for my most special lady.

717
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,000
My most beautiful.

718
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,370
How sweet. But how did you arrange all this?

719
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,870
With the help of a genie.

720
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,370
That I should've guessed.

721
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:10,910
Thank you.

722
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,290
Oh..this is called love.

723
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,870
This is called love at first sight.

724
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,750
Not first, it's second sight.

725
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,250
She's the girl we saw on Skype. - Yeah.

726
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,500
Why are you guys standing there?

727
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,910
Come meet Jay. - Hi, Jay.

728
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,120
Hi, Jay. How are you?

729
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,500
How was the flight?

730
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:38,370
Hi, Jay. Finally. - Yeah, finally.

731
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:39,660
Well, those are my friends.

732
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,040
Derek, Paula and Roxie.

733
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,500
Hi.

734
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,500
Hi. - Roxie.

735
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,290
Hi. - I love you.

736
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,750
I knew it..

737
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:49,750
I love you.

738
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,870
How's Gulabo? - She's good. Let's go meet her.

739
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:52,870
Let's go to the hotel.

740
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,500
Yeah..

741
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,870
Nice guy, huh.

742
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,370
What do you say, sir?

743
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,540
Your arrangement was fantastic. - Well, thank you, sir.

744
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,620
Excuse me.

745
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:18,870
Sweety, what song did you select for our dance?

746
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,410
I was thinking about that old number.

747
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,120
Everyone's been talking about our love.

748
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,160
Sweety, what a selection.

749
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,250
Thank you.

750
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,500
You remember. - Why wouldn't I?

751
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:34,120
I would always stare at Mumtaz's hairstyle.

752
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,540
And I was looking at her tight sari.

753
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,620
What? - It was too tight, that's why.

754
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,290
See that.

755
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,370
She's teaching her father to dance.

756
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,250
You know..she's going to make you dance to her tunes as well.

757
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:07,000
Forget about me..tell your partner to rehearse for the dance.

758
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,250
Jay doesn't need to rehearse, okay. - I see.

759
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,500
When Jay and I come on the dance floor..

760
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,120
..we're going to be so awesome, everyone will be mesmerized.

761
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:20,120
I can't do it. I can't do it.

762
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,910
Papa, mom has already learned all the dance steps.

763
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,620
If she dances better than you, will you be able to take it?

764
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:30,000
What? Your mom's going to dance too? - Yes. With you.

765
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,790
This must be her idea.

766
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,790
She always wants to make me dance to her tune.

767
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,790
Papa, it's my idea.

768
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,910
Dear..I thought you're smart..like me.

769
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,290
Papa, please. Enough talking, and start dancing.

770
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,250
Come on, like this.

771
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,370
Since mom's dancing, I will have to.

772
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,370
3.. 4.. 5.. 6..

773
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,290
Very good.

774
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,370
Again.

775
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,410
Batli, teach me properly.

776
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,660
Ladies and Gentlemen.

777
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,750
First of all, let's begin with applauding for the two lovely couples..

778
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,540
..whose wedding you're here for.

779
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,040
Adi and Riya.

780
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,250
Congratulations, guys.

781
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,500
Thanks.

782
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,660
Anushka and Jay.

783
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,500
Jay..

784
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,370
Thank you, people.

785
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:35,250
A poet once said that marriage is like an old wine.

786
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,040
Well said!

787
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,500
The older it gets, the more high it gets you.

788
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,750
Yeah right.

789
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:43,120
Well, according to me, Mr. Kapoor..

790
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,750
..marriage is like a chewing gum.

791
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,250
In the beginning it tastes sweet.

792
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:52,660
But later it tastes like rubber.

793
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,540
Maybe you're right, Mr. Sodhi.

794
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,410
Let's see how sweet your chewing gum..

795
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,290
I mean your marriage still is.

796
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,040
This is the theme of the party.

797
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:03,750
How well do you know your partner?

798
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,870
So..Mr. Sodhi, do you remember your first meeting with Sweety?

799
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,000
I do, Mr. Kapoor, I still do.

800
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,750
Sweety was wearing a red color sari.

801
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,250
I should've understood that..

802
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,790
..it's a sign of danger. - Oh, Lord!

803
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,250
Mr. Kumar. - Yeah.

804
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:26,790
When you met Amrita for the first time, how was she looking?

805
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:30,370
Mr. Kapoor, what did you just ask?

806
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,870
You should've asked him something business related..

807
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,620
..and he would've replied promptly.

808
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,040
But he won't remember our first meeting.

809
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:44,120
Well..she was looking beautiful.

810
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,250
She was wearing a white dress.

811
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,370
Her hair was untied, 'bindi' on the forehead..

812
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,750
..and a red purse in her hand.

813
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,160
Wow!

814
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,160
Well said.

815
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:56,750
Well..okay.

816
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,620
If you don't mind, ma'am.

817
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:06,870
Do you remember your first love? - Forget my first love.

818
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,540
I remember my latest.

819
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:14,040
Just some time ago, a very handsome guy..

820
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,790
..whispered something into my ears.

821
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:21,540
The black suit on his fair body looked just dapper.

822
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:27,000
And his brown eyes..like two pegs of whiskey.

823
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,750
And the print on his tie.

824
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:34,500
Mr. Jay, what were you saying? - No..nothing..

825
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:37,500
Luv, I haven't finished yet.

826
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:41,370
Yes, but..Mr. Jay, what were you saying?

827
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,790
Tell us something about Anushka we don't know.

828
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,870
I am not good with words. - Come on.

829
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,370
Speak up, son.

830
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,750
I am just a painter, Gulabo..

831
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,250
..but I would like to say something today.

832
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:55,410
Wonderful.

833
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,160
It's not easy to make a place for yourself..

834
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:00,870
..in Anushka's heart.

835
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,540
And no one knows it better than me.

836
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,870
But if she gives you a place in her heart..

837
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,500
..then you're locked there forever.

838
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,160
Brilliant.

839
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,370
I love you. - I love you.

840
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:23,500
Well, Ms. Riya. - Yes.

841
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,910
Do you know anything special about Adi..

842
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,660
..which you would like to share with us?

843
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,370
Me? No, no, no..

844
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:30,370
Come on, Riya.

845
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,250
Please. Come on.

846
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:32,410
Speak up.

847
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,160
Adi..

848
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,750
Adi has many special qualities.

849
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,790
He's..very polite.

850
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:44,250
He's..very generous, very helpful.

851
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:48,000
And most importantly, he's very intelligent.

852
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,370
In fact, he's a genius.

853
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:52,160
Wow!

854
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:54,910
Great. Good going, thank you madam.

855
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,870
Listen, listen..attention please.

856
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:01,160
We all know that about Adi.

857
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:02,620
Right? - Yes.

858
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:05,120
But there's one thing that only I know.

859
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,790
Which one. - Tell us.

860
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:07,790
Tell us..

861
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:10,910
We should know about Adi's hidden talent as well.

862
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:12,500
You're going to love it.

863
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:14,040
Okay.

864
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,750
So..we all know that Adi is a fabulous dancer. Right? - Yes.

865
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:24,250
But, Adi is not a regular dancer.

866
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,540
He is the best cabaret dancer.

867
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:31,000
Cabaret.

868
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:34,000
I will kill you.

869
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,120
Cabaret dancers are really cute.

870
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,040
Right. As if you've seen cabarets.

871
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:41,250
Honestly.

872
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:43,500
You know, whenever Adi would get ragged in college..

873
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,500
..he would do this amazing cabaret.

874
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:48,000
Come, show us.

875
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,540
No!

876
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,620
I am not going.

877
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,790
Come on.

878
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,250
Why not?

879
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:56,160
Come on, yes.

880
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,540
Adi! Adi! Adi!

881
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,660
Cabaret! Cabaret! Cabaret!

882
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,120
Come on, son.

883
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,540
Come on, show us.

884
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,540
Come on, Adi.

885
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,370
Cabaret! Cabaret!

886
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:21,910
Since I saw..your rosy eyes.

887
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,370
My heart's on a high.

888
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:30,870
Hold me..O friends.

889
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:34,910
As I am out of control.

890
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:39,620
Since I saw..your rosy eyes.

891
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:44,120
My heart's on a high.

892
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:48,500
Hold me..O friends.

893
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,620
As I am out of control.

894
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,500
You said you don't know cabaret.

895
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,250
I can watch and follow.

896
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,870
My heart's filled with your dreams.

897
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:05,410
Like a wall filled with images.

898
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:09,790
Why did I fall for you?

899
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:14,540
I am angry over love.

900
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:19,500
I am ruined..after losing my heart.

901
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,660
I am no longer good for anything.

902
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:24,250
What do I say..beloved.

903
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:33,120
Your bewitching eyes..pierced my heart.

904
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:37,540
Since I saw..your rosy eyes.

905
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:41,620
My heart's on a high.

906
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:46,290
Since I saw..your rosy eyes.

907
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:50,370
My heart's on a high.

908
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:55,250
Hold me..O friends.

909
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:59,120
As I am out of control.

910
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,500
Amazing, son.

911
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,000
Hi.

912
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:23,120
If you're not waiting for someone..

913
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,620
..then..can I sit here?

914
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:27,790
I stopped waiting a long time ago.

915
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,370
Please, sit.

916
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,250
Looking nice.

917
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,370
I always look nice.

918
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,750
Maybe you just noticed it.

919
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,660
No, I mean it.

920
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:58,870
Maybe you started looking more beautiful after we parted ways.

921
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:01,040
Thank you.

922
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:03,750
You don't look bad either.

923
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:06,370
I guess you have put on some weight.

924
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,870
Why? No one to control your diet?

925
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:20,160
When I had you, my diet would stay in control, and my life too.

926
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,910
But you wanted total control over everything.

927
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:29,040
You even wanted to run our family like a corporate organization.

928
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:32,000
And how could a progressive woman like you..

929
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:34,620
..endure someone else taking decisions around the house.

930
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,790
Right?

931
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:39,370
Like your decision to send five year old Riya to boarding?

932
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:42,250
While doing that, you didn't realize that..

933
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:49,500
..while your business and Page 3 status was important for you..

934
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,910
..Riya was important for me.

935
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,250
You were responsible for driving me away, Kumar.

936
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:00,910
Amrita, please.

937
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:08,620
After you two left, I realized..

938
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:12,910
..that a home is not made of bricks and stones.

939
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,160
But..

940
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,160
But your ego stopped you..

941
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,750
..from calling me back home, right?

942
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,500
I don't know, Amrita, but..

943
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,410
I missed you.

944
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,250
I missed you terribly.

945
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:35,910
Did you miss me?

946
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,250
Maybe even more than you.

947
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,870
Scarlet. - My favorite color.

948
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,870
And the name of our daughter too.

949
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,790
Why daughter?

950
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,410
Because she will be as beautiful as you.

951
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:19,910
Jay, am I really that beautiful? - Of course.

952
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:22,160
From head to toe.

953
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,410
You've the most beautiful feet in the world.

954
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:30,660
I love you, Jay.

955
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:45,500
What happened?

956
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:48,870
What happened?

957
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:52,370
I am sorry..but that Adi..

958
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,500
Crazy.

959
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,660
You know, that day when he did the cabaret.

960
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:01,620
He came and said to me..

961
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:04,750
You know, if you marry Jay..

962
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:07,370
..you'll see nude girls in your house all the time.

963
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:20,910
What the hell..

964
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,160
I will do this every day after marriage. - What?

965
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:26,500
But I love you.

966
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,620
Please, go. - But..

967
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,750
What's wrong? You look really happy.

968
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:36,000
Batli just proposed to Roxie for the ninth time.

969
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,790
Eleven. - So what?

970
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,290
Roxie baby, I love you.

971
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:45,370
I am sorry.

972
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,040
I am really sorry.

973
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,160
It's okay.

974
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:53,870
Where's Anushka? - She went with Jay to the waterfall.

975
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,870
Guess they want to spend some time alone.

976
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:19,870
Hi, Jay. - Hi, guys.

977
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:21,500
What are you guys doing here?

978
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,500
What are we doing here?

979
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:27,250
We're here to disturb you two.

980
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,250
We thought Jay's making some obscene painting of you.

981
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,120
Rascal.

982
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,040
Wow!

983
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,620
It's an amazing place.

984
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:43,500
Don't think, Adi, let's go.

985
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,250
One.

986
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,120
Two.

987
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,870
And three.

988
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:55,870
Come on, Lambu.

989
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:57,250
Batli, you too.

990
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,370
Run, run.

991
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,910
Jay, come on. - No, no, you carry on.

992
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,370
Petha, come on.

993
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,870
They are all crazy.

994
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,790
But that's what I like about you.

995
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,540
Come on, run. - I am not coming.

996
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:30,000
You go. - Come on.

997
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,250
Come on.

998
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:35,750
Adi, you're going to lose.

999
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,040
Come on, Lambu.

1000
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,120
I won!

1001
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,160
Oh my God!

1002
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:06,500
Mom.

1003
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,250
Riya.

1004
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:11,620
Come in.

1005
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:19,000
Mom, what are you doing in dad's room?

1006
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,620
Dear, I..

1007
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:22,620
Just listen to me.

1008
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,790
Amrita, I was thinking..

1009
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:33,500
You two..kept meeting and never told me.

1010
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:38,870
No. - Dear..how this happened, even we don't know.

1011
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,540
What do you mean, mom?

1012
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:46,500
Look, dear..relationships are strange.

1013
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:51,750
Even if you stop holding hands, doesn't mean the relationship is over.

1014
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:54,500
You know what, your mom and I came here for your wedding.

1015
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,870
We met..and we realized..

1016
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:02,790
..that we lost the best years of our lives, because of our ego.

1017
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:05,250
But..we love each other.

1018
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:19,000
If you two had seen through your egos earlier..

1019
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:23,000
..then I wouldn't have received your love in bits and pieces.

1020
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,620
Sorry, dear. We're so sorry.

1021
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,410
Don't be sorry.

1022
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:32,370
I am happy.

1023
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,540
Just come here.

1024
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:37,500
I love you. - We love you.

1025
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,410
Tell me..do we still look good together?

1026
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:46,040
The best couple on earth..

1027
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:47,660
Ever!

1028
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,790
Love you.

1029
00:57:53,750 --> 00:58:02,160
Punjabi folk song.

1030
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:07,910
Punjabi folk song.

1031
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:11,500
No.. no.. - Please..

1032
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:14,750
Days just flew by so soon.

1033
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,750
You had just arrived from London.

1034
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:22,790
And now..it's time for you to go back to London.

1035
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:27,370
You're marrying a guy from London.

1036
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:30,250
But don't forget our culture, our tradition..

1037
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:32,790
..and the promises of marriage.

1038
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:37,290
Mom, what promises are they talking about?

1039
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:40,910
The seven promises of the seven nuptial rounds, dear.

1040
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:44,000
Where the husband and wife promise each other..

1041
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,910
..to be each other's strength, support each other in every situation..

1042
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:52,750
..and..not just husband-wife, but they will be best friends forever.

1043
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:55,120
But Adi's best friend is Anushka.

1044
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:58,000
Before his marriage.

1045
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:00,870
After the marriage, Adi will be your best friend.

1046
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,500
And Anushka's best friend will be Jay.

1047
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,870
Understand.

1048
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:07,870
I'll be right back.

1049
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:09,370
Okay. - Okay, mom.

1050
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,290
I'll just come.

1051
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:27,660
Punjabi folk song.

1052
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:32,160
Punjabi folk song.

1053
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:41,250
Punjabi folk song.

1054
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:55,370
Anushka. - Two minutes, I'll be back.

1055
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,620
I want to talk to you. - Yes.

1056
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:02,250
For the first time in my life..

1057
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,750
..I am observing a fast.

1058
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:06,000
Of Karva Chauth!

1059
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,500
Riya, you actually believe in all this?

1060
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:11,370
Yeah! I want Adi in every lifetime.

1061
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:15,500
Okay, listen. Don't tell Adi about this, please.

1062
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:17,870
I want this to be a surprise for him.

1063
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,660
In fact, I told no one about this. Not even mom.

1064
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:24,410
But listen, I need your help.

1065
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:27,750
Will you please bring Adi at the poolside when I break my fast?

1066
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:29,370
Riya, oh my God, no.

1067
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,370
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

1068
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:33,500
Anushka, please.

1069
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,250
Please don't refuse.

1070
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:38,120
Adi will go anywhere with you.

1071
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:40,410
Come on.. - He never refuses you.

1072
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,750
Riya, this is so silly.

1073
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:46,410
Anushka, come on. For our sake.

1074
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:49,040
Please, please, please, just say yes.

1075
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:51,750
Yes. - Okay.

1076
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:52,540
Thank you.

1077
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,500
I'll call you when we're ready, okay. - Yes.

1078
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:56,370
Thank you.

1079
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,540
But Adi's best friend is Anushka.

1080
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:07,250
Before his marriage.

1081
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,000
After the marriage, Adi will be your best friend.

1082
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:23,790
I am in love..what to do?

1083
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,370
I am in love..what to do?

1084
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:33,540
I am in love..

1085
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:37,250
I am in love..what to do?

1086
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:40,540
I am in love..

1087
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:47,410
I can't live..nor can I die.

1088
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:50,870
I am in love..what to do?

1089
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:54,250
I am in love..

1090
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:57,660
I am in love..what to do?

1091
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:00,500
I am in love..

1092
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:07,750
I am in love..what to do?

1093
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:38,790
Listen to my plea.

1094
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:42,370
I am restless night and day.

1095
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:45,620
Listen to my plea.

1096
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:49,160
I am restless night and day.

1097
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:55,870
O Lord..I am in big trouble.

1098
01:02:55,910 --> 01:03:02,540
Someone..save me.

1099
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:08,660
How do I endure this pain?

1100
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:15,910
How do I endure this pain?

1101
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,910
I am in love..what to do?

1102
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,120
I am in love..

1103
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,870
I am in love..what to do?

1104
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:29,790
I am in love..

1105
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:31,370
Didn't your husband come?

1106
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:37,000
I can't live..nor can I die.

1107
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:40,620
I am in love..what to do?

1108
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:43,790
I am in love..

1109
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:50,120
I am in love..what to do?

1110
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:54,910
I am in love..

1111
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,660
I am in love..

1112
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,290
A'..sing from A

1113
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:18,250
A'..sing from A

1114
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:19,000
Tick-tick one..

1115
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,500
Tick-tick two..

1116
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:21,870
Tick-tick three..

1117
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:23,160
A'..sing from A

1118
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:30,910
O sweetheart..I am your love.

1119
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:37,040
Oh my..your denial.

1120
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:39,250
Come to me.

1121
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:43,410
Come to me.

1122
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,870
Come on.

1123
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:52,870
Everyone's been talking about our love.

1124
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:57,120
Everyone knows..

1125
01:04:57,250 --> 01:05:02,000
Everyone's been talking about our love.

1126
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:06,620
Everyone knows..

1127
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,790
Riya. - Hi.

1128
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:13,910
Good morning.

1129
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:17,120
Listen, I am really sorry about last night.

1130
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,910
You know, actually I slept early.

1131
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,620
And missed your calls.

1132
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:24,120
It's a good thing you didn't receive my calls.

1133
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:27,620
You know what happened? - What happened?

1134
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,620
When I couldn't talk to you..

1135
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:32,120
..I went to Adi's room looking for him.

1136
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:35,370
And he was shocked to see me all decked up.

1137
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,620
Nice. - Nice?

1138
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:40,660
Nice happened after that.

1139
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:44,250
When I told him that I was fasting for him.

1140
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:46,120
He was so happy to hear that.

1141
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:51,870
He made me drink the juice and broke my fast.

1142
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,500
Can you imagine Adi doing all of that?

1143
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:57,870
It was the most beautiful night of my life.

1144
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,500
And all thanks to you.

1145
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:05,250
I am so happy.

1146
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:10,790
Girls, you can plan your honeymoon later.

1147
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:14,120
First come and play this singing game with us.

1148
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:21,370
Yamma Yamma... Yamma Yamma O the beautiful ambiance.

1149
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:24,620
Tonight's the night to..

1150
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:26,250
Anushka, you're on the wrong side.

1151
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:28,500
You're on my team. Come on. Fast.

1152
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:29,620
Come, come, come.

1153
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:31,000
Sing something starting from 'H'.

1154
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:38,500
I can't live without you.

1155
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:43,000
I don't exist without you.

1156
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:52,370
If I separate from you, I'll lose myself.

1157
01:06:53,370 --> 01:06:57,370
Because it's you.. it's you.

1158
01:06:58,370 --> 01:07:02,290
You're my life.

1159
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,120
Wait, wait. I know this one.

1160
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:25,620
I don't know how much I truly love you.

1161
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:32,250
But I know that I can't live without you.

1162
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,160
That's a really romantic number.

1163
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:41,540
But I know that I can't live without you.

1164
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:58,500
I wonder what path..my crazy heart's heading down.

1165
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:08,000
Some broken dream's still pricking in my eye.

1166
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:19,620
The fake assurances..make me cry.

1167
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:27,000
What's this punishment..O Lord.

1168
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:36,410
Tell me..what fate wants.

1169
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:46,500
Tell me.. why are our paths separate?

1170
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:54,870
O fate..

1171
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:05,000
The moments immersed in darkness.

1172
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:09,660
How do I bring them in the light again?

1173
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:14,120
Do I burn like a passionate lover?

1174
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:20,370
Or like the candle.

1175
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:29,410
But I've to burn all night..in any condition.

1176
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:37,040
What's this punishment.. O Lord.

1177
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:46,370
Tell me..what fate wants.

1178
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:56,250
Tell me.. why are our paths separate?

1179
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:03,620
O fate..

1180
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,500
O fate..

1181
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:13,040
Batli. - Yes,

1182
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,910
Your Sweety aunty. - Yeah.

1183
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,160
Wonderful person.

1184
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:19,750
But she gets angry over small things.

1185
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:23,500
Last year, exactly a month before my anniversary..

1186
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:25,870
..she got angry over a really small thing.

1187
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:26,750
What happened?

1188
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,620
I had an affair with someone.

1189
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:31,870
And I thought..she's my wife, I love her.

1190
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
So I must tell her first.

1191
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,750
And so I did, and she got angry.

1192
01:10:36,910 --> 01:10:37,910
I wonder why.

1193
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,120
Cheers, Mr. Kumar. - Cheers.

1194
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,000
She can't see me happy, I don't know why.

1195
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,250
Jay, come, come. - Hi.

1196
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,500
Hello, Jay. - Hi.

1197
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:50,870
What do you do? - I..

1198
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:53,290
Uncle, Jay is a nude painter.

1199
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,500
Nude painter? - Yeah.

1200
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:58,250
Come closer son, don't just stand there.

1201
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,290
Son..half nude or full nude?

1202
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:05,540
No, uncle..he means I paint nude models.

1203
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,870
Oh.. - There's Jay.

1204
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:10,410
Gulabo. - Jay, sweety.

1205
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,660
Come here.

1206
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:16,910
Congratulations, he's a nice boy. - Thank you.

1207
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,250
And the best thing is he's a painter.

1208
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,370
Wow!

1209
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:21,540
Really?

1210
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:24,000
Jay, why don't you paint me some day?

1211
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:26,410
Curse you.

1212
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:27,620
What happened?

1213
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:29,620
Go get ready, don't you want to go to the party?

1214
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:31,040
She wants her painting made.

1215
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:31,540
Go.

1216
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,660
Come on. Let's go. - Painting..

1217
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:48,250
Hi. - Hey. You're looking nice.

1218
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:49,250
Thanks.

1219
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:54,250
Anushka said you're going to set the dance floor on fire.

1220
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,620
I am not too sure about that.

1221
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:57,790
Why?

1222
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:01,250
You must have made many girls dance to your tune in London.

1223
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:06,870
Well..that's true, but the situation here is different.

1224
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:09,290
First time in my life I met a girl..

1225
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:11,040
..that makes me dance to her tunes.

1226
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:15,160
Jay, Adi..what are you doing up on the stairs?

1227
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:16,870
This is a musical night.

1228
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,160
Someone play the music.

1229
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:19,790
Dance. - Right.

1230
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:21,250
Wow!

1231
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:23,790
Welcome, son.

1232
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:34,000
A beautiful girl walks by..

1233
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:37,040
A thorn has pierced your feet, damsel.

1234
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:48,870
A beautiful girl walks by..

1235
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:51,790
A thorn has pierced your feet, damsel.

1236
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:56,290
Don't lock..lock horns with love.

1237
01:12:56,370 --> 01:13:00,000
Or it will be a big mess, beloved.

1238
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:03,750
Don't lock..lock horns with love.

1239
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:08,040
Or it will be a big mess, beloved.

1240
01:13:08,290 --> 01:13:10,660
Know who I am..

1241
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:14,120
I am a really nice boy.

1242
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:18,250
I am a really nice boy.

1243
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,540
I want to lock..lock horns with love.

1244
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:34,250
Let there be a mess..I don't care.

1245
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:36,500
Move aside.

1246
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:40,000
You're a really bad boy.

1247
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:43,870
You're a really bad boy.

1248
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:47,250
The thread of the veil is stuck in the door.

1249
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:50,000
Brother-in-law quarrels with his sister-in-law.

1250
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:54,660
Younger brother-in-law, you will be blessed.

1251
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:57,750
Don't quarrel with her, you have only one sister-in-law.

1252
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:03,410
You've got no say, but you make tall claims.

1253
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:07,540
Take a look at yourself in the mirror.

1254
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:12,500
Why do you fight with me?

1255
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:14,790
Why are you upset with me?

1256
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:18,500
My love's really deep.

1257
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:22,120
Take a dip in love.

1258
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:25,870
My heart's totally crazy about you.

1259
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:28,040
You know..

1260
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:31,540
You're a really bad boy.

1261
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:35,750
You're a really bad boy.

1262
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:55,120
You follow me around..or you stare at me.

1263
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:59,160
Your actions are so cheap.

1264
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,160
I turned into Romeo only for you.

1265
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:10,160
Let's start our very own love story.

1266
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:13,870
Let's set things straight.

1267
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:17,410
May our companion be super-hit.

1268
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:19,910
Stay away from me

1269
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,540
You're a really bad boy.

1270
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:27,250
I am a really nice boy.

1271
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:31,000
You're a really bad boy.

1272
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:34,620
I am a really nice boy.

1273
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:38,250
You're a really bad boy.

1274
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:42,000
I am a really nice boy.

1275
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:45,750
You're a really bad boy.

1276
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:49,120
The thread of the veil is stuck in the door.

1277
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,790
Brother-in-law quarrels with his sister-in-law.

1278
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:56,620
Younger brother-in-law, you will be blessed.

1279
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:59,500
Don't quarrel with her, you have only one sister-in-law.

1280
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:03,870
Brother-in-law quarrels with his sister-in-law.

1281
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:16,120
Let's go.

1282
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,870
You think there's something between them..

1283
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,250
No, no, it's nothing.

1284
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:31,160
I didn't say anything.

1285
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:34,040
So how did you know what I was going to say?

1286
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,660
Excuse me, ma'am. May I get you a chair?

1287
01:16:55,290 --> 01:16:58,000
No, thank you. - Well..sure.

1288
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:02,750
Pardon me, ma'am.

1289
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:06,250
This is the only aspect of the moon we've seen.

1290
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,620
Have you seen the other aspect of the moon?

1291
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
No.

1292
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:14,250
I didn't either.

1293
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:20,040
And I never saw the bride thinking all alone..on the Musical Night.

1294
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:25,410
This happens..when there's a twist in the love story.

1295
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:30,750
I'm trying to understand whose love-story is it.

1296
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,500
It's so funny..

1297
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:36,040
..but what are you doing here at this hour?

1298
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:37,410
Why aren't you asleep?

1299
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:40,620
Two kinds of people don't sleep at night.

1300
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:42,870
Those who are in love..

1301
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:46,000
And those..who never got love.

1302
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:50,160
But..only one kind of people say such philosophical things.

1303
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:52,500
Someone who don't get their love.

1304
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:54,000
Am I right?

1305
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:56,870
You know you're beautiful, and intelligent too.

1306
01:17:56,910 --> 01:17:58,870
And that's a lethal combination.

1307
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:01,160
You didn't answer my question.

1308
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:03,620
And stubborn.

1309
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:08,750
Well..

1310
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:14,620
There was a time when I was in love. - I knew it.

1311
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:19,250
And did she? Did she love you?

1312
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,620
Yes, of course.

1313
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,250
So why was your love-story incomplete?

1314
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:28,040
I was too late.

1315
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:32,250
By the time I could confess my love..

1316
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:34,120
..her parents got her married.

1317
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,910
And then I realized, that love isn't enough.

1318
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:41,160
One should have the courage to get your love.

1319
01:18:43,290 --> 01:18:44,620
Have a good night, ma'am.

1320
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:53,500
The number you've called is not answering.

1321
01:18:58,910 --> 01:19:02,120
The number you've called is currently unavailable..

1322
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:06,290
Hello. - Good morning.

1323
01:19:06,370 --> 01:19:09,500
Hi, could you please connect me to room 550, Aditya's room.

1324
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:10,370
Sure, ma'am.

1325
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,120
Ma'am, the number is busy.

1326
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:37,620
Hi, aunty.

1327
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:39,910
Where's Adi?

1328
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,160
Thank God you're here.

1329
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:44,750
Come in, quickly.

1330
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:49,540
Things are in a mess since morning. - Aunty..

1331
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:52,250
Do something. - We are. We are.

1332
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:54,620
Here you go, dear?

1333
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:56,500
What's this?

1334
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:58,870
These are Riya's nuptial ornaments.

1335
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:02,620
Aunty.. - Did you pack the sweets?

1336
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:04,750
Hurry up. - Aunty, where's Adi?

1337
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:06,160
Why would he be here?

1338
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:08,750
He's downstairs in the lawn, the functions are about to begin.

1339
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:10,000
Come with me, quickly.

1340
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:13,290
No, aunty..I won't come.

1341
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,250
Why?

1342
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:17,790
I mean..I'm not ready yet.

1343
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:21,290
You don't need to get ready.

1344
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:25,410
These are not your ornaments.

1345
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:30,040
Hurry up..we're getting late. - Coming.

1346
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:41,500
Decorate the palanquin, the wedding procession has arrived.

1347
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:47,120
It's the night when the bride leaves.

1348
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:53,620
It's the time..when the eyes shed tears.

1349
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:59,410
Dreams are turning into reality.

1350
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:05,370
Decorate the palanquin, the wedding procession has arrived.

1351
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:11,410
It's the night when the bride leaves.

1352
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:29,500
O Wanderer..don't go.

1353
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:35,500
O Wanderer..don't go.

1354
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:41,500
Who are you looking for?

1355
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:47,410
O Wanderer..don't go.

1356
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:53,620
O Wanderer..don't go.

1357
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:59,040
I don't want to let go.

1358
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:06,000
Please stay with me some more.

1359
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,660
I don't want to let go.

1360
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:23,620
O Wanderer..don't go.

1361
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:29,540
O Wanderer..don't go.

1362
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,620
Why did you stop?

1363
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:02,790
Adi, are you happy?

1364
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,370
What do you mean?

1365
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:10,120
Aren't you happy? - I am very happy.

1366
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:13,370
All my dreams are coming true.

1367
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:16,750
If you're happy, then smile.

1368
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:32,870
I am confused.

1369
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:36,870
I don't know who to share my confusion with.

1370
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:41,370
Sir, pardon me if I say so.

1371
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,870
You should share these things with Riya ma'am.

1372
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:48,500
After all, you're going to marry her.

1373
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:52,250
Why? What happened?

1374
01:23:53,370 --> 01:23:56,620
You're not comfortable with Riya? - No, that's not it.

1375
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:58,000
Then what is it?

1376
01:23:58,870 --> 01:23:59,910
You like her, don't you?

1377
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:00,870
Of course.

1378
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,370
She's beautiful, caring, from a good family.

1379
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:06,040
My parents like her.

1380
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:08,410
I can't find a better girl.

1381
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:11,250
But do you love her?

1382
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,660
Yes..I think so.

1383
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:18,500
I mean..I thought so.

1384
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:21,000
I don't know, I am really confused.

1385
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,290
Tell me one thing.

1386
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:29,410
Which are the most memorable moments in your life?

1387
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:35,870
Mr. Kapoor, I'm trying to understand what's going on with me right now.

1388
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:38,000
And you're playing games with me.

1389
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:42,160
Sir, I am only trying to help you find your answers.

1390
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:47,370
Tell me..which are the best moments in your life?

1391
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:49,250
Think.

1392
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:53,410
Well..I can't forget that day..

1393
01:24:54,370 --> 01:24:55,750
Happy birthday, Adi.

1394
01:24:57,540 --> 01:25:00,540
Happy birthday to you.

1395
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:07,120
Happy birthday, Adi.

1396
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:10,250
And after cutting the cake..

1397
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:13,790
..the moment when I tasted beer first.

1398
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:15,040
Come on.

1399
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:20,540
Adi! Adi! Adi! Adi!

1400
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:23,620
Only Anushka can be so crazy.

1401
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:30,120
He's gone, Batli.

1402
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:32,750
Adi! Adi! Adi!

1403
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:37,500
You drank around three liters..just tasting.

1404
01:25:38,910 --> 01:25:39,870
Wow!

1405
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:42,120
Let's move on, what else?

1406
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:46,910
The moment..when I bought the first bike.

1407
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:47,750
Thanks to Anushka.

1408
01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:48,620
So, friends.

1409
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:51,000
Welcome to the boxing competition.

1410
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:55,120
The winner gets a brand new car.

1411
01:25:55,290 --> 01:25:57,120
If you lose, you get the bike.

1412
01:25:57,370 --> 01:25:59,370
And friends, hold your heart.

1413
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:02,250
Because the loser gets a beating..

1414
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:05,290
..as well as a new motorcycle.

1415
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:14,540
And the first bike-ride after getting beaten up.

1416
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:15,620
Yes!

1417
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:17,790
Come on, let's go.

1418
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:20,750
And the moment when Anushka..

1419
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:26,620
She turned all my moments from a dream to a reality.

1420
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:30,910
And suddenly one day, she fought with me over a small thing..

1421
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:32,540
..and went to London.

1422
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:50,290
Anushka. - There you are.

1423
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:55,910
Now you know it. - Yes..Anushka.

1424
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,870
Absolutely.

1425
01:27:01,410 --> 01:27:07,620
I've been wondering..what's wrong with me.

1426
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:13,540
Everything seems absolutely new.

1427
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:21,870
O beloved..what condition is this?

1428
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:25,370
Feels a lot like love.

1429
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:30,500
What have you done to me?

1430
01:27:30,790 --> 01:27:39,040
O beloved..what condition is this?

1431
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:42,620
Feels a lot like love.

1432
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:47,750
What have you done to me?

1433
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:56,000
You're the tune..that struck automatically.

1434
01:27:56,290 --> 01:28:01,620
You're a secret..that unveiled by itself.

1435
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:09,870
O beloved..what condition is this?

1436
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:13,410
Feels a lot like love.

1437
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:19,620
What have you done to me?

1438
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:23,500
My dreams pleaded and my eyes complained.

1439
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:26,540
But I couldn't sleep.

1440
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:30,290
Each breath recommended and the heart became audacious.

1441
01:28:30,370 --> 01:28:33,910
It was the limit.

1442
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:39,620
The heart fell in love.

1443
01:28:40,910 --> 01:28:45,910
The heart fell in love.

1444
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:51,000
Just like a soft smile that spurted on my lips, but..

1445
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:54,540
..my eyes were filled with tears.

1446
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:59,290
You're that tear, beloved.

1447
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:04,750
I am na ve, surprised..and a little troubled.

1448
01:29:04,870 --> 01:29:08,250
What do I explain to myself?

1449
01:29:08,370 --> 01:29:13,120
Do I laugh or do I cry, beloved.

1450
01:29:14,870 --> 01:29:23,370
How do I suppress my desires?

1451
01:29:23,410 --> 01:29:34,040
How do I hide whatever's happening?

1452
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:42,540
O beloved..what condition is this?

1453
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:46,000
Feels a lot like love.

1454
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:50,790
What have you done to me?

1455
01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:59,660
O beloved..what condition is this?

1456
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:03,000
Feels a lot like love.

1457
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:08,870
What have you done to me?

1458
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:12,790
My dreams pleaded and my eyes complained.

1459
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:16,120
But I couldn't sleep.

1460
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:20,120
Each breath recommended and the heart became audacious.

1461
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:22,910
It was the limit.

1462
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:27,620
The heart fell in love.

1463
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:34,620
The heart fell in love.

1464
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:05,870
Hello.

1465
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,120
Hi..what are you doing?

1466
01:31:09,370 --> 01:31:12,500
Getting ready. Jay's invited me for dinner.

1467
01:31:12,790 --> 01:31:15,120
Okay..can you come meet me?

1468
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:19,290
Adi, I just said I'm going for dinner with Jay.

1469
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:22,120
But I must meet you urgently.

1470
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:24,870
Please. Please. Please.

1471
01:31:26,290 --> 01:31:28,870
I don't have the time. - I don't either.

1472
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:31,540
Please, I want to say to you.

1473
01:31:32,370 --> 01:31:34,120
Please. Please, listen, Anushka.

1474
01:31:34,410 --> 01:31:34,870
It's important.

1475
01:31:34,910 --> 01:31:42,370
I wonder what path..my crazy heart's heading down.

1476
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:51,620
Some broken dream's still pricking in my eye.

1477
01:31:54,790 --> 01:32:04,000
The fake assurances..make me cry.

1478
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:11,500
What's this punishment..O Lord.

1479
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:14,620
Tell me..what fate wants.

1480
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,370
You're looking really beautiful.

1481
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:21,910
Adi, whatever you called me here to say, it better be important.

1482
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:29,750
There was a confusion between my heart and mind for a long time.

1483
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:33,250
The heart wouldn't agree with what the mind said.

1484
01:32:34,370 --> 01:32:36,250
And the mind says..

1485
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:40,250
But now.. - You have to listen to one of them, Adi.

1486
01:32:44,370 --> 01:32:46,540
There can be nothing more important..

1487
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:48,370
..than what I want to say today.

1488
01:32:49,910 --> 01:32:54,750
Anushka..when two people fall in love, and can't be together..

1489
01:32:55,910 --> 01:32:58,790
..they either blame the stars or the society.

1490
01:32:58,870 --> 01:33:00,250
Or the situation.

1491
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,750
But the problem is somewhere inside them.

1492
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:10,410
I realized today, when two people are in love..

1493
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,370
..they should say it immediately.

1494
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:15,370
Otherwise..

1495
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:20,870
Otherwise.. - Otherwise what, Adi?

1496
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Otherwise they lose that moment..

1497
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:29,660
..and it never comes back.

1498
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:33,620
Anushka, I..

1499
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:36,750
I..

1500
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:47,620
Hello. - Hello.

1501
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:49,000
Yes, Kumar sir.

1502
01:33:49,370 --> 01:33:50,370
Where are you?

1503
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:56,250
I am with my friends. - I hope I didn't disturb you.

1504
01:33:56,370 --> 01:33:58,250
No..no..

1505
01:33:58,410 --> 01:34:00,620
I wasn't doing anything special. - Adi?

1506
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:01,750
Adi..

1507
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:03,870
One second. - Actually, I want to talk to you.

1508
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:04,870
So come see me.

1509
01:34:05,370 --> 01:34:06,500
Yes, of course.

1510
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,750
I'll come right away. - Good.

1511
01:34:10,290 --> 01:34:11,370
Okay, sir.

1512
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,750
Tell me..what fate wants.

1513
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:17,620
Okay, sir.

1514
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:22,370
Anushka!

1515
01:34:24,370 --> 01:34:25,620
Anushka!

1516
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:28,290
Anushka!

1517
01:34:33,370 --> 01:34:38,000
The fake assurances..make me cry.

1518
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,500
Hi.

1519
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:49,540
What's this punishment..O Lord.

1520
01:34:49,870 --> 01:34:50,540
Champagne?

1521
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:57,790
Tell me..what fate wants.

1522
01:35:00,910 --> 01:35:02,040
It's over.

1523
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:08,290
I finished it while waiting for you.

1524
01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:18,120
I made you wait really long. - Not really.

1525
01:35:19,660 --> 01:35:24,120
Anushka, I won't ask you why you took so long to come.

1526
01:35:26,410 --> 01:35:30,290
Or what's been troubling you.

1527
01:35:32,620 --> 01:35:34,040
Because I know.

1528
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:43,620
Anushka, when we love someone..

1529
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:46,500
..it's really difficult to hide.

1530
01:35:51,750 --> 01:35:53,370
And the problem is..

1531
01:35:54,910 --> 01:35:58,750
..neither can you hide it, nor can I.

1532
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,410
What do you mean, Jay?

1533
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:15,540
I've lived you.

1534
01:36:16,750 --> 01:36:18,660
I have..lived you.

1535
01:36:19,410 --> 01:36:21,040
I love with all my heart, and..

1536
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:32,370
Happiness came to me..with its back turned towards me.

1537
01:36:32,410 --> 01:36:41,790
As I shook hands, it started crying.

1538
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:52,290
All my support..are helpless.

1539
01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:59,750
What was my mistake, O Lord?

1540
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:07,870
Tell me..what fate wants.

1541
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:14,120
Whiskey? - No, sir.

1542
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:16,750
Sir?

1543
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:24,660
How long will you keep calling me sir?

1544
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,290
Get used to calling me dad.

1545
01:37:27,370 --> 01:37:29,660
Yes..Dad.

1546
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:32,500
Did you call me for something important?

1547
01:37:33,370 --> 01:37:38,120
You see..we'll soon be related for life.

1548
01:37:38,370 --> 01:37:40,250
I know a lot about you, but..

1549
01:37:40,290 --> 01:37:44,410
..I want you to know few things about me.

1550
01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:59,370
Look, son..I achieved everything in life.

1551
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:00,750
Everything.

1552
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,500
But there's just one thing I regret.

1553
01:38:04,870 --> 01:38:09,410
Amrita and I couldn't give her the love she deserved.

1554
01:38:10,870 --> 01:38:12,620
I realize my mistake.

1555
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:16,790
And so..the goal of my life is Riya and her happiness.

1556
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:19,790
And her happiness..is you.

1557
01:38:23,370 --> 01:38:31,620
She thinks..you'll love her all her life and keep her happy.

1558
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:36,290
You do love her, but I've noticed..

1559
01:38:36,370 --> 01:38:39,750
..that you love your friends little too much.

1560
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:45,750
I..didn't understand.

1561
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:53,290
Adi..

1562
01:38:55,370 --> 01:38:59,290
I want you to give Riya so much love..

1563
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:01,370
..that she forgets her past.

1564
01:39:02,410 --> 01:39:04,870
Yeah.. - And Riya gives you so much love..

1565
01:39:04,910 --> 01:39:07,750
..that you forget your friends.

1566
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:10,500
I hope you understand what I'm saying?

1567
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:14,410
Yes, I do..

1568
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,750
Good..I knew you would understand.

1569
01:39:20,790 --> 01:39:21,750
Anushka!

1570
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:24,290
Anushka, what's wrong?

1571
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,120
Dear, open the door.

1572
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:28,000
Anushka!

1573
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:30,750
Tell us what's wrong.

1574
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:35,000
Anushka, for my sake.

1575
01:39:35,790 --> 01:39:38,250
Come out. - Open the door.

1576
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:40,500
Open the door, dear. - Don't do this, dear.

1577
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,160
Open the door, dear.

1578
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:46,790
Anushka, for my sake.

1579
01:39:46,870 --> 01:39:50,910
Come out, come out, dear.

1580
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:53,160
Open the door, dear.

1581
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:55,000
Anushka. Come out, quickly.

1582
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:56,250
Anushka.

1583
01:39:56,370 --> 01:39:57,870
What's wrong?

1584
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:03,500
Be honest, dear. What's wrong?

1585
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,000
The truth is..I'm getting married tomorrow..to Jay.

1586
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:09,500
Yes.

1587
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:12,370
Yes, dear.

1588
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,250
Don't cry.

1589
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:17,040
I know..

1590
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:23,660
The truth is..you love Adi. Right?

1591
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:26,910
What's the point, Gulabo?

1592
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:29,750
That's not it, dear.

1593
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:34,620
I know.. Adi loves you.

1594
01:40:35,620 --> 01:40:37,620
It's not too late, dear.

1595
01:40:37,660 --> 01:40:40,910
Go and tell him.. - What's the point, Gulabo?

1596
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:42,660
He should say something too.

1597
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:45,160
Don't worry, dear.

1598
01:40:46,370 --> 01:40:50,000
You will get what you're destined for.

1599
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:53,750
Don't cry dear.

1600
01:40:54,870 --> 01:41:00,660
Where are you headed now?

1601
01:41:00,870 --> 01:41:05,750
It's almost evening.

1602
01:41:05,790 --> 01:41:11,500
I've lost the address..

1603
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:17,160
Everything I wrote down, was erased.

1604
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:24,000
Adi.

1605
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:26,790
Where were you? I was looking all over for you.

1606
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:28,620
Why? What happened?

1607
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:33,370
You're still awake. - No. I am scared.

1608
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:38,370
Feels like something is not right.

1609
01:41:38,870 --> 01:41:41,870
You look.. - Me?

1610
01:41:44,370 --> 01:41:45,370
What, Riya?

1611
01:41:45,410 --> 01:41:49,250
Just tell me that what I'm thinking is wrong.

1612
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:52,120
Just tell me it's my imagination.

1613
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:54,370
Just tell me it'll all be fine, Adi.

1614
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:57,620
Just..just tell me that you love me.

1615
01:41:57,660 --> 01:42:00,250
Just that..

1616
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:02,660
Please.. - Adi, tell me.

1617
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:04,870
Adi. - Please calm down.

1618
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:25,410
I am sorry. I am really sorry, Riya.

1619
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:27,750
I am tired.

1620
01:42:29,290 --> 01:42:30,870
Go get some sleep.

1621
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,370
I need some rest.

1622
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:47,250
Good night.

1623
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:01,000
Excuse me. - Yes, ma'am.

1624
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:03,250
I said satin curtains in this section.

1625
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:04,910
These are not satin.

1626
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:08,040
Okay, rosewater, welcome drink and..

1627
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:10,870
And these flowers? - Ma'am, you said white flowers.

1628
01:43:10,910 --> 01:43:12,870
I said white orchids.

1629
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:14,660
Riya. - What?

1630
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:16,370
What are you doing?

1631
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:18,750
Forget all this, and get ready.

1632
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:20,620
How can I?

1633
01:43:20,750 --> 01:43:23,750
I specifically said I don't want florescent color.

1634
01:43:23,790 --> 01:43:25,160
I just want soothing colors. - That's okay.

1635
01:43:25,290 --> 01:43:26,870
Relax, dear. It will all be fine.

1636
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,370
When will it be fine, dad? After my marriage.

1637
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:31,870
Everything's wrong here.

1638
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,910
Everything's wrong in my marriage.

1639
01:43:34,910 --> 01:43:37,790
Dad, everything is going wrong in my marriage.

1640
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:41,870
Nothing, nothing, nothing will go wrong in your marriage.

1641
01:43:41,910 --> 01:43:42,870
I am right here.

1642
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,120
Look at me. Nothing will go wrong.

1643
01:43:45,250 --> 01:43:48,000
I will make sure everything goes right.

1644
01:43:48,410 --> 01:43:50,160
Oh my..what kind of a place is this?

1645
01:43:50,410 --> 01:43:51,870
You can't find a single thing.

1646
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:53,870
Back in India, you make one call..

1647
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,790
..and the shopkeeper delivers the goods to your doorstep.

1648
01:43:55,870 --> 01:43:58,250
Here's the telephone.

1649
01:43:58,290 --> 01:44:01,870
Call room service and tell them what to get.

1650
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:06,160
I see..I can't find the drawstring of your pajamas.

1651
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:08,250
Call room service and ask them to get it.

1652
01:44:09,410 --> 01:44:10,750
Hello, drawstring..

1653
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:12,410
You don't get drawstrings here.

1654
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:14,620
Exactly, I can't find anything.

1655
01:44:14,870 --> 01:44:17,790
And since the time you got here, you've been behaving like a tourist.

1656
01:44:17,870 --> 01:44:20,120
As if only my son's getting married.

1657
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:22,370
And son..

1658
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:25,000
Why are you so upset?

1659
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:25,870
It's not good.

1660
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:27,660
Now go get ready quickly.

1661
01:44:27,790 --> 01:44:29,160
You.. - And listen.

1662
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:32,250
Listen..

1663
01:44:32,540 --> 01:44:36,000
The list which the priest gave us also has betel leaves.

1664
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:38,250
They should be here by the nuptial rounds.

1665
01:44:38,370 --> 01:44:40,910
Oh Lord..what is this you gave me?

1666
01:44:42,790 --> 01:44:47,120
I can't believe this is the same woman I married.

1667
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:51,910
If I am lying for a minute, it makes her mad.

1668
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,290
Crazy woman.

1669
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,540
What are you up to?

1670
01:45:11,660 --> 01:45:12,910
Adi..

1671
01:45:14,870 --> 01:45:19,250
Don't think I don't know what's going on in your life.

1672
01:45:19,910 --> 01:45:21,370
I know it all.

1673
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:24,290
I am your father.

1674
01:45:27,290 --> 01:45:30,540
Seriousness doesn't look good on my face.

1675
01:45:31,870 --> 01:45:33,500
But all I would say..

1676
01:45:34,790 --> 01:45:38,620
..do what your heart says.

1677
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:44,000
My son.

1678
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:54,620
There's no place for dreams in reality, Anushka.

1679
01:45:56,540 --> 01:45:57,750
Get ready quickly.

1680
01:45:57,790 --> 01:45:59,160
Jay's waiting for you.

1681
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:05,870
Just excuse us, please.

1682
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:07,410
I'll be right back, Anushka.

1683
01:46:10,370 --> 01:46:14,540
Anushka, I invited you and your family over..

1684
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:16,540
..and gave them a lot of respect.

1685
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,000
Would you agree?

1686
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:19,370
Yeah!

1687
01:46:19,660 --> 01:46:21,620
So isn't it your duty to..

1688
01:46:21,660 --> 01:46:24,500
..to think about Adi and my family's respect?

1689
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:28,410
Uncle, I didn't understand.

1690
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:29,910
What are you trying to say?

1691
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,870
Alright. I'll be direct.

1692
01:46:32,410 --> 01:46:35,290
Adi isn't just getting Riya's love from this marriage.

1693
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:39,500
He's getting a opportunity to fulfill all the dreams that he saw.

1694
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:41,750
I know.

1695
01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:45,000
Who would know about Adi's dreams better than me?

1696
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:47,910
But you don't know that..

1697
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,790
..there's a thin line between friendship and love.

1698
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:53,500
And it's hard to say when you cross it.

1699
01:46:53,870 --> 01:46:57,250
The friendship that you and Adi share..

1700
01:46:57,620 --> 01:46:59,660
..keep it till that.

1701
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,040
You got that?

1702
01:47:01,250 --> 01:47:03,910
Because only Riya has a right to Adi's love.

1703
01:47:05,370 --> 01:47:08,500
And love is for the one that has the right to it.

1704
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:12,660
I hope I've made myself..amply clear.

1705
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:16,910
Yes.

1706
01:47:18,910 --> 01:47:20,410
Yes.

1707
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:25,410
Uncle, you made everything very clear.

1708
01:47:26,910 --> 01:47:28,410
You are right.

1709
01:47:30,870 --> 01:47:36,370
And love is for the one that has the right to it.

1710
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:38,870
Yes.

1711
01:47:39,250 --> 01:47:40,370
Good!

1712
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:54,660
I said I'm not in the mood to talk.

1713
01:47:54,910 --> 01:47:57,000
By the time you're in the mood to talk..

1714
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:59,120
..it will be worthless.

1715
01:47:59,540 --> 01:48:02,750
Why are you yelling? - So that I knock some sense in you.

1716
01:48:02,910 --> 01:48:04,160
Forget it, Petha.

1717
01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:07,660
He can't see what everyone can.

1718
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:10,120
So how can he hear your voice?

1719
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:11,870
Have you two lost your mind?

1720
01:48:12,370 --> 01:48:14,660
Stop yelling at me and go get booze. - Booze?

1721
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:18,040
Should we drink on the occasion of your marriage..

1722
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:19,370
..or to drown your sorrows?

1723
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:23,000
Mind your tongue. You're talking about my marriage.

1724
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:24,660
You're not the only one getting married.

1725
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:26,000
Anushka's getting married too.

1726
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:28,500
And whether you think about her or not, but we do.

1727
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:31,370
What do you mean by I don't think about her?

1728
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:32,250
You do?

1729
01:48:32,370 --> 01:48:34,750
Then go tell Riya that you don't love her.

1730
01:48:34,790 --> 01:48:36,290
You love Anushka. Tell her.

1731
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:43,250
Forget it, Petha. It's not his cup of tea,

1732
01:48:43,410 --> 01:48:44,620
He's a coward.

1733
01:48:44,660 --> 01:48:47,000
Who are you to tell me?

1734
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:48,620
It's my life. - Leave.

1735
01:48:48,750 --> 01:48:50,500
No! It's not just your life.

1736
01:48:50,540 --> 01:48:51,790
Leave him. - Understood.

1737
01:48:51,870 --> 01:48:57,250
You're ruining Anushka, Riya as well as Jay's life too.

1738
01:48:57,370 --> 01:49:01,410
Seems like you love your bike more than their lives.

1739
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:03,120
Leave him.

1740
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:06,040
There's no point talking to him.

1741
01:49:06,370 --> 01:49:07,410
Let's go. Come on.

1742
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:10,290
You do what you want. Come on.

1743
01:49:17,370 --> 01:49:20,000
Take the bride's hand in yours.

1744
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:25,250
I am in love..what to do?

1745
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:29,750
Sprinkle water.

1746
01:49:30,410 --> 01:49:37,250
I am in love..what to do?

1747
01:49:37,370 --> 01:49:41,750
I am in love..what to do?

1748
01:49:41,790 --> 01:49:43,910
Now pour clarified butter in the fire.

1749
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:50,500
I can't live..or die.

1750
01:49:51,790 --> 01:49:53,000
Adi. - Yeah.

1751
01:49:53,290 --> 01:49:55,870
The priest is asking us to pour clarified butter in the fire. - Yes.

1752
01:49:57,790 --> 01:50:04,540
I am in love..what to do?

1753
01:50:04,750 --> 01:50:08,910
I am in love..what to do?

1754
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,370
Adi, where are you lost?

1755
01:50:11,870 --> 01:50:14,120
Petha, Nikki, Batli..I don't see anyone.

1756
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:19,250
Adi, we're getting married.

1757
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:22,790
And you're still thinking about your friends.

1758
01:50:35,370 --> 01:50:36,750
Where are granny and Gulabo?

1759
01:50:42,790 --> 01:50:43,620
Adi?

1760
01:50:44,540 --> 01:50:45,660
Adi?

1761
01:50:49,370 --> 01:50:50,370
Where is everyone?

1762
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:52,290
Petha, where's Anushka?

1763
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:53,620
Where's Anushka?

1764
01:50:53,870 --> 01:50:54,870
She left.

1765
01:50:55,660 --> 01:50:57,370
She went back to London.

1766
01:51:02,620 --> 01:51:05,620
Adi, we're getting married.

1767
01:51:06,370 --> 01:51:08,290
You're still thinking about Anushka.

1768
01:51:08,370 --> 01:51:11,620
Anushka's gone. - Yes, she left.

1769
01:51:11,910 --> 01:51:14,750
Because she can't watch you marrying me.

1770
01:51:14,790 --> 01:51:17,290
She loves you. - I love her too!

1771
01:51:19,750 --> 01:51:20,660
Move aside.

1772
01:51:21,290 --> 01:51:22,500
I love her.

1773
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:24,910
How dare you?

1774
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:26,750
Hold on!

1775
01:51:28,910 --> 01:51:32,620
Mr. Kumar, we can retaliate with violence as well.

1776
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:36,790
But we can't solve this problem with hitting each other.

1777
01:51:36,910 --> 01:51:39,370
Because this matter concerns the heart..

1778
01:51:39,620 --> 01:51:41,370
..and I think it's beyond your understanding.

1779
01:51:41,910 --> 01:51:43,120
Let him hit me, papa.

1780
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:47,250
But even though you hit me..

1781
01:51:49,250 --> 01:51:50,790
..I will be honest with you.

1782
01:51:52,250 --> 01:51:56,370
The truth..that took me really long to understand.

1783
01:51:58,540 --> 01:52:00,750
That I love Anushka.

1784
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:02,500
Why you.. - Papa, please!

1785
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:04,540
What?

1786
01:52:05,870 --> 01:52:08,290
Even I realized this truth.

1787
01:52:09,660 --> 01:52:12,750
My heart knew that he loved Anushka.

1788
01:52:14,290 --> 01:52:17,750
But maybe I took too long to realize this truth.

1789
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,250
But how the hell can he do this?

1790
01:52:20,540 --> 01:52:21,910
You once said..

1791
01:52:23,370 --> 01:52:25,620
Even if you stop holding hands, relationships don't break.

1792
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,500
Pardon me, Mr. Kumar.

1793
01:52:37,410 --> 01:52:40,250
I know this is your personal matter.

1794
01:52:42,370 --> 01:52:46,370
But when few lives are at the stake of ruination..

1795
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:48,370
..then I can't keep quiet.

1796
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:51,620
What do you want to say?

1797
01:52:52,290 --> 01:52:53,370
Just think, sir.

1798
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:56,500
When will your daughter be happier?

1799
01:52:58,120 --> 01:53:00,500
If Adi doesn't marry Riya..

1800
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:06,370
..or if Adi marries Riya, but keeps loving Anushka in his heart?

1801
01:53:08,660 --> 01:53:10,870
Everyone falls in love, Mr. Kumar.

1802
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:14,910
But only a few have the courage to get their love.

1803
01:53:16,620 --> 01:53:19,120
Today Adi told the truth in front of everyone.

1804
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:23,370
But somewhere everyone's betterment lies in his truth.

1805
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:29,000
The rest is up to you to decide, sir.

1806
01:53:31,790 --> 01:53:33,500
Mr. Kapoor is right, papa.

1807
01:53:33,790 --> 01:53:36,120
Even if you get me married to Adi.

1808
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:41,000
He won't be happy neither will I.

1809
01:53:42,750 --> 01:53:45,120
Because he loves Anushka.

1810
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:47,870
I am really sorry, Riya.

1811
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:56,620
Thank you, sir.

1812
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:49,120
Anushka!

1813
01:55:04,370 --> 01:55:06,290
Anushka!

1814
01:55:17,410 --> 01:55:19,910
Adi! Adi!

1815
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:29,660
Anushka!

1816
01:55:35,790 --> 01:55:41,870
I am still wondering..what just happened.

1817
01:55:42,620 --> 01:55:47,870
Everything feels new.

1818
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:52,040
O beloved..

1819
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:55,370
How? How can you leave me?

1820
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,040
What else could I do, Adi?

1821
01:55:58,120 --> 01:56:00,870
Throw flowers at your marriage with Riya?

1822
01:56:02,620 --> 01:56:04,790
I thought you left me.

1823
01:56:06,410 --> 01:56:08,040
I almost died.

1824
01:56:08,870 --> 01:56:10,160
I love you, Adi.

1825
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:11,750
I love you more.

1826
01:56:11,910 --> 01:56:20,120
O beloved..what is this condition?

1827
01:56:20,410 --> 01:56:23,750
Feels like love.

1828
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:27,790
What have you done to me?

1829
01:56:28,910 --> 01:56:31,120
You knew that I would come.

1830
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:33,370
Yes, I did.

1831
01:56:34,290 --> 01:56:35,290
Me too.

1832
01:56:36,910 --> 01:56:39,870
Jay. I am sorry, buddy.

1833
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:42,500
There's no justification for love.

1834
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,750
Love is just..love.

1835
01:56:46,370 --> 01:56:47,250
Thanks, Jay.

1836
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:50,120
And by the way, I've booked your honeymoon tickets.

1837
01:56:58,750 --> 01:57:00,620
Adi..don't you think..

1838
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:03,370
..we should get married before the honeymoon.

1839
01:57:05,620 --> 01:57:06,620
Yes!

1840
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:13,620
Lambu, come down.

1841
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,290
Come down.

1842
01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:27,250
Decorate the venue. Eat some sweets.

1843
01:57:27,290 --> 01:57:30,540
Shake a leg with the guests.

1844
01:57:31,410 --> 01:57:35,370
Anushka's married, now I can drink in peace.

1845
01:57:35,540 --> 01:57:38,160
Invite all your guests.

1846
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,870
That Luv Kapoor's looking so hot.

1847
01:57:42,910 --> 01:57:44,410
I am looking hot.

1848
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:48,500
The Wedding Pulav.

1849
01:57:48,620 --> 01:57:51,160
The Wedding Pulav.

1850
01:57:51,290 --> 01:57:52,660
Come on, kiss..

1851
01:57:52,750 --> 01:57:54,120
Lambu, kiss him.

1852
01:57:54,410 --> 01:57:55,410
Come on.

1853
01:57:57,290 --> 01:57:58,370
Come on. - What is she doing?

1854
01:57:58,410 --> 01:58:00,370
What are you doing? Come on.

1855
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:01,750
Hurry up.

1856
01:58:10,910 --> 01:58:12,040
Sweety. - Yeah.

1857
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:13,870
The son's going for his honeymoon. - Yes.

1858
01:58:13,910 --> 01:58:15,620
What about the father?

1859
01:58:16,250 --> 01:58:17,870
You are just. - What?

1860
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:19,870
Too much. - What?

1861
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,790
Forget it. - Why?

1862
01:58:22,410 --> 01:58:24,540
Carry on then. - I am.

1863
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:28,120
I am not doing it to you.

1864
01:58:28,750 --> 01:58:30,500
Did you two break up?

1865
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,870
No, she said yes.

1866
01:58:35,410 --> 01:58:37,500
Play this song again.

1867
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:39,370
Thanks, Jay.

1868
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:41,790
This love story wouldn't be complete without you.

1869
01:58:42,910 --> 01:58:44,120
It's not complete yet.

1870
01:58:44,540 --> 01:58:45,870
This is just the beginning.

1871
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:49,870
Aren't you a bit overdressed?

1872
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:51,790
Of course.

1873
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,290
It's my could-be would-be husband's wedding after all.

1874
01:58:56,660 --> 01:58:57,660
We're together!

1875
01:59:05,910 --> 01:59:08,160
Selfie!

1876
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:12,790
Decorate the palanquin..and the horse.

1877
01:59:12,870 --> 01:59:16,120
Play the music out loud.

1878
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:22,160
Get a picture taken with the bride-groom.

1879
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:27,620
Raise the volume..and make everyone sway.

1880
01:59:27,620 --> 01:59:30,000
Play this song again.

1881
01:59:30,120 --> 01:59:32,790
The Wedding Pulav.

1882
01:59:33,870 --> 01:59:36,370
The Wedding Pulav.

1883
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:39,750
The Wedding Pulav.

1884
01:59:41,290 --> 01:59:43,410
The Wedding Pulav.

1885
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:02,000
The Wedding Pulav.
