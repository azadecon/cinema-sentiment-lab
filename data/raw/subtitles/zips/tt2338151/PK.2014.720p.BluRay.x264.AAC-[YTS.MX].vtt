00:01:46.583 --> 00:01:48.583
'How many stars sparkle in the sky?'

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.708
'Ever tried counting them?'

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:58.875
'It would take 6,000 years to
count those in our galaxy.'

00:02:00.416 --> 00:02:02.583
'And how many such galaxies exist?'

00:02:02.833 --> 00:02:06.625
'Scientists reckon, two billion more.'

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.291
'Isn't it possible that amongst
these billions of celestial bodies'

00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:16.000
'a planet with people like us, exists?'

00:02:16.416 --> 00:02:20.166
'As we explore the space looking for them,'

00:02:20.458 --> 00:02:24.708
'could they be coming here,
looking for us?'

00:06:14.083 --> 00:06:18.500
'What the thief stole was the
gadget to recall his spaceship.'

00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:22.333
'Without this remote
he could not return home.'

00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:27.041
'He neither knew our language,
nor did he have a friend here.'

00:06:27.333 --> 00:06:31.291
'Alone, anguished,
his only thought was...'

00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:33.416
"how will I return home?"

00:06:56.291 --> 00:07:01.708
<i>On the pathway of time</i>
<i>Life is but a brief flame</i>

00:07:02.416 --> 00:07:07.500
<i>In its luminous mist</i>
<i>We wish, we dream, we exist</i>

00:07:08.041 --> 00:07:10.958
<i>But on a beautiful bend</i>

00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:13.875
<i>A stranger may we meet</i>

00:07:14.041 --> 00:07:17.208
<i>Life after life</i>

00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:20.000
<i>Whose memory may persist</i>

00:07:39.416 --> 00:07:41.500
Extra tickets. Anyone, extra ticket...

00:07:41.583 --> 00:07:42.750
Yes, sir...

00:07:44.416 --> 00:07:46.208
Sorry, I raised my hand first.

00:07:46.291 --> 00:07:49.000
But I called out first.

00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:52.000
I'm a big fan of Harivansh Rai Bachchan.

00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:54.958
I'm a bigger fan of his son,
Amitabh Bachchan.

00:07:55.291 --> 00:07:57.208
I've been reading his poems
since I was ten.

00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:58.166
I've memorized them all.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.583
I know his dialogues since
I was five, without even memorizing them!

00:08:01.708 --> 00:08:03.333
Hello, who wants it?

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:05.916
Give it to me.
Poetry's not his cup of tea.

00:08:06.208 --> 00:08:07.250
100 euros.

00:08:07.833 --> 00:08:11.333
100 for a ticket worth 40?
Black market of poetry!

00:08:11.458 --> 00:08:13.666
I queued up six long hours for this.

00:08:13.916 --> 00:08:15.208
Time is running.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.791
Go for the dialogues.
- All yours. Ladies first.

00:08:28.083 --> 00:08:30.791
Just a second!
Why not split the ticket?

00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.166
You can enjoy the poetry
in the first half

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.375
and I'll savor the acting
in the second half.

00:08:39.083 --> 00:08:40.791
It's a really damn good idea!

00:08:43.625 --> 00:08:45.375
10, 20, 30, 40...

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:47.000
Fifty...
- Six.

00:08:47.083 --> 00:08:48.333
96.
- 96.

00:08:49.833 --> 00:08:53.250
96 euros! How about a discount?
We're from the same country.

00:08:53.416 --> 00:08:55.541
Hail India, bro!

00:08:55.666 --> 00:08:58.500
Long live the motherland!
100 euros.

00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:03.291
Extra tickets...
Anyone, extra ticket...

00:09:04.458 --> 00:09:05.541
Sir!

00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.416
Can I borrow 4 euros?
Please!

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.916
You can keep my watch till I repay you.

00:09:11.166 --> 00:09:13.250
Please, Sir,
it's the last ticket.

00:09:13.541 --> 00:09:16.791
The show is sold out, child.
There are no tickets left.

00:09:17.041 --> 00:09:20.875
There is one left
with that black marketeer.

00:09:21.416 --> 00:09:22.875
Scoundrel!

00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:26.333
He's bringing shame to India.
- So true!

00:09:26.583 --> 00:09:29.750
Wait here.
I'll get you that ticket.

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:32.583
Thank you!

00:09:41.875 --> 00:09:43.416
Yes!
- Yeah!

00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:52.333
What the...

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.791
Sir!
- Do I know you?

00:09:56.875 --> 00:09:58.208
Where's my ticket?

00:09:58.291 --> 00:10:01.333
Ticket?
Yours for 100 euros.

00:10:01.416 --> 00:10:03.500
You bloody cheat!

00:10:03.583 --> 00:10:06.041
Decaying dacoit!
Senile snake! Capitalist!

00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:07.333
Mind your language!

00:10:07.416 --> 00:10:09.791
Mind your coat first!

00:10:10.875 --> 00:10:13.541
Now enjoy the show!
- Security!

00:10:13.916 --> 00:10:14.958
Wrinkled wreck!

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.541
Let's get out of here.

00:10:19.625 --> 00:10:22.291
I won't spare you, old man!
- Shameless girl!

00:10:22.791 --> 00:10:25.458
Don't chase me.
Catch him!

00:10:39.125 --> 00:10:42.250
Oldies these days!
It's a spoilt generation!

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.666
Don't let it bother you.

00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.625
Forget about it.
- How can I?

00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.250
That bandit must be enjoying
the poetry and here I am!

00:10:49.375 --> 00:10:50.541
Drop it.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.166
Why pine for the party
that shuns us?

00:10:55.416 --> 00:10:58.666
Follow the moment
that beckons us.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.458
I too dabble in poetry.

00:11:01.666 --> 00:11:03.458
It's nice. Go on.

00:11:04.625 --> 00:11:10.541
No. If I go on,
you'll propose to me.

00:11:11.916 --> 00:11:13.916
Are you crazy?
- I mean it!

00:11:14.416 --> 00:11:16.333
Your favorite poet,
senior Mr. Bachchan

00:11:16.708 --> 00:11:19.375
met a lady one morning,
wooed her with a verse

00:11:19.625 --> 00:11:22.041
and by dusk they were married.
So I've read.

00:11:22.666 --> 00:11:26.458
And boy!
Look what they produced!

00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:28.875
Mr. Amitabh Bachchan.

00:11:30.541 --> 00:11:31.625
Jaggu.

00:11:32.083 --> 00:11:33.125
Jaggu?

00:11:33.666 --> 00:11:34.750
My name.

00:11:35.083 --> 00:11:38.291
Papa had given me a horrendous name.
Jagat Janani!

00:11:38.458 --> 00:11:40.833
I used to get mocked at school
so I shortened it.

00:11:41.083 --> 00:11:42.166
Jaggu!

00:11:43.166 --> 00:11:44.916
From Mumbai?
- No. Delhi.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.666
I'm studying TV production here.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:47.916
And you?

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:50.708
I am Sarfaraz.
I study architecture...

00:11:51.458 --> 00:11:54.166
and work part-time
at the Pakistan Embassy.

00:11:54.666 --> 00:11:56.666
The Pakistan Embassy? Why?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.125
Because I'm from Pakistan.

00:11:59.416 --> 00:12:03.000
It's unlikely the Indian Embassy
will employ me!

00:12:05.333 --> 00:12:06.791
What's wrong?

00:12:07.375 --> 00:12:08.750
Nothing.

00:12:12.458 --> 00:12:15.916
Since I am from Pakistan,
it perturbs you, doesn't it?

00:12:19.916 --> 00:12:21.541
Alright then.

00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:24.000
Goodbye.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:45.375

-Thank you!
-Thank you!

00:16:28.916 --> 00:16:30.875
Mom! Papa!

00:16:31.041 --> 00:16:32.958
She's fallen in love!

00:16:33.041 --> 00:16:35.000
Fallen in love?

00:16:35.833 --> 00:16:37.166
He's so cute!

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.750
More photos please!

00:16:39.041 --> 00:16:41.708
What's his job?
What's his family like?

00:16:42.166 --> 00:16:44.166
Calm down, Mom.
I'll tell you.

00:16:44.291 --> 00:16:45.625
'First, tell me the name.'

00:16:46.625 --> 00:16:48.291
Sarfaraz.

00:16:48.541 --> 00:16:50.208
Is he a Muslim?

00:16:51.125 --> 00:16:54.791
Yes. He's studying architecture.
His family is in Pakistan.

00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.375
Pakistan!
Which Pakistan?

00:16:57.666 --> 00:16:59.166
'There's just one Pakistan, Mom.'

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:02.541
You'll wear burkas? Read the Quran?
Have you gone crazy?

00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:05.625
Don't you disconnect.
Stay put.

00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:07.125
Start the car.

00:17:07.208 --> 00:17:09.375
All's doomed, Your Holiness.
Help!

'He would set up an auspicious
time even for a root canal.'

00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:38.625
'He had gifted Papa a God box
with a deity for every task.'

00:17:39.333 --> 00:17:43.208
'Goddess of Wealth
for the stock market.'

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:48.250
'God of Health for workouts.'

00:17:48.791 --> 00:17:52.041
'Web-based worship and
sacred sweets by courier'

00:17:52.166 --> 00:17:54.791
'were his innovations.'

00:18:00.458 --> 00:18:03.416
Hail, Your Holiness.

00:18:05.416 --> 00:18:07.166
Hail, Your Holiness.

00:18:08.916 --> 00:18:11.375
Touch his feet Jaggu.

00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:24.666
Why this fatal infatuation?

00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:28.374
'Pick up a pen and write.'

00:18:28.708 --> 00:18:30.208
God...

00:18:31.041 --> 00:18:32.583
enlighten me.

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:39.041
Yes.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.708
Yes.

00:18:42.708 --> 00:18:45.166
'Your wish is our command.'

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.791
Write down the prophecy.

00:18:48.124 --> 00:18:50.208
'This Pakistani boy,'

00:18:50.541 --> 00:18:52.083
Sarfaraz,

00:18:53.291 --> 00:18:54.666
will betray you.

00:18:54.916 --> 00:18:57.166
I know he won't.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.916
'History stands witness.'

00:19:01.208 --> 00:19:05.250
These people scheme and betray.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.958
He will pursue carnal pleasures.

00:19:09.083 --> 00:19:12.541
But he will never marry you.
He'll vanish.

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:17.500
Jaggu, come back home! One more
night there, and you're dead to us.

00:19:17.583 --> 00:19:20.500
'Mr. Sahni, let me talk to her.'

00:19:20.833 --> 00:19:24.541
Child, hit the delete button.

00:19:24.875 --> 00:19:27.125
'Banish him from your system.'

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.416
What happened?

00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:40.291
Do you love me?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.750
Of course, I do. Why?
- Will you marry me?

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.791
What's the matter?
- Yes or no, Sarfaraz?

00:19:48.125 --> 00:19:49.166
Yes, but...

00:19:49.333 --> 00:19:51.250
Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

00:19:51.833 --> 00:19:53.333
Tomorrow we get married.

00:19:55.208 --> 00:19:57.208
His prophecy is wrong.

00:19:57.958 --> 00:19:59.125
I'll prove it.

00:20:11.916 --> 00:20:15.083
Mr. James Henrik and
Miss Ophrah Brown, you're next.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:18.666
James isn't here yet.
- Oh. Talk to the Registrar.

00:20:19.375 --> 00:20:22.208
Could you just hold this, please?
- Of course.

00:20:23.875 --> 00:21:27.375
Hello.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.375
This is for you.

00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:30.500
For me?
- Yeah.

00:20:30.833 --> 00:20:31.958
Thank you.

00:20:36.916 --> 00:20:38.250
'It was from Sarfaraz.'

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:42.250
He said, "Marriage isn't just
between individuals, but families.

00:20:42.333 --> 00:20:45.291
Our faiths, countries,
cultures are different.

00:20:45.625 --> 00:20:48.375
We can never be happy
if our families are unhappy.

00:20:48.458 --> 00:20:50.750
Don't try to contact me.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.500
I'm sorry."

00:21:13.083 --> 00:21:14.833
Where to go, young lady?

00:21:15.416 --> 00:21:16.250
New Delhi.

00:21:20.541 --> 00:21:24.666
'I came back to my city,
but my parents refused to see me.'

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.958
'I joined a news channel as a reporter.'

00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:29.375
Today's story: a depressed dog.

00:21:29.458 --> 00:21:30.750
That's our breaking news!

00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:34.625
'Some days we had the news
and some days we fabricated it.'

00:21:55.125 --> 00:21:58.416
Missing: God.

00:21:59.125 --> 00:22:01.833
If found, contact Tipsy.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.250
There's a story in this man.
I'll see you at office.

00:22:08.625 --> 00:22:09.958
Don't be late!

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.875
Why are you handing these out?

00:22:27.458 --> 00:22:29.416
I have a case pending with Him.

00:22:29.833 --> 00:22:31.791
He neither solves it, nor meets me.

00:22:32.125 --> 00:22:33.500
My life is kaput.

00:22:35.375 --> 00:22:38.041
He's gone into hiding.

00:22:39.416 --> 00:22:41.750
Have you seen Him around?

00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:43.833
No.

00:22:46.916 --> 00:22:50.750
<i>Hail Goddess,</i>
<i>Hail Holy Mother</i>

00:22:50.875 --> 00:22:54.750
<i>Hail Goddess,</i>
<i>Hail Holy Mother</i>

00:22:54.833 --> 00:23:00.500
<i>Hail Goddess,</i>
<i>Hail Holy Mother</i>

00:23:00.583 --> 00:23:02.833
By the way, what's with the helmet?

00:23:03.041 --> 00:23:05.166
I got the idea from taxi-tops.

00:23:05.458 --> 00:23:08.291
Yellow yells out from miles.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.500
It's because of this that taxis
are spotted easily in traffic.

00:23:11.958 --> 00:23:15.625
So?
- So, even God will spot me easily.

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.750
How else will he spot me
in this crowd?

00:23:27.958 --> 00:23:29.041
A bit to your left.

00:23:29.416 --> 00:23:32.000
Yeah, yeah, perfect.
Okay, background...

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:37.541
They say animals are not suicidal.

00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:41.875
Here's Nikku.
Mr. Sweetie Singh's dog.

00:23:42.708 --> 00:23:46.250
Nikku has attempted suicide thrice.

00:23:46.333 --> 00:23:52.000
He jumped off a roof, licked sleeping
pills and hopped onto a gas burner.

00:23:52.708 --> 00:23:54.416
'What's wrong with Nikku?'

00:23:54.541 --> 00:23:57.791
Is Nikku prey to a mental problem?

00:23:58.333 --> 00:23:59.708
Is Nikku...

00:24:01.958 --> 00:24:03.833
What's wrong, Jaggu?

00:24:04.125 --> 00:24:05.958
What is this shit, Mitu?

00:24:10.083 --> 00:24:13.458
Our chat with famed industrialist,
Mr. Ratan continues

00:24:13.541 --> 00:24:15.291
right after this break.

00:24:17.791 --> 00:24:19.250
You wanna have some coffee?

00:24:19.333 --> 00:24:20.833
Get him some coffee.

00:24:21.083 --> 00:24:22.916
Cherry!
- Yes.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.041
What's your guess?

00:24:24.125 --> 00:24:26.416
Does this dog have depression,
anxiety disorder,

00:24:26.625 --> 00:24:29.958
schizophrenia, or ADHD?

00:24:30.458 --> 00:24:32.208
Whatever, why would I care?

00:24:32.291 --> 00:24:35.333
Exactly! Why would anyone care?

00:24:35.458 --> 00:24:38.458
Why do we air such stupid news?

00:24:39.125 --> 00:24:41.000
What would you rather air?

00:24:41.083 --> 00:24:43.333
Hold him, please.

00:24:45.125 --> 00:24:46.291
Look at this.

00:24:46.375 --> 00:24:49.625
I met a guy distributing
these pamphlets.

00:24:49.875 --> 00:24:52.875
He is searching for God.
- Did he find Him?

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:54.958
No. But...

00:24:55.041 --> 00:24:59.250
"Searching for God," that's religion.
"Finding God," that's news.

00:24:59.333 --> 00:25:01.083
If he finds God, get him.

00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:02.125
I'll put him on air.
- But...

00:25:02.208 --> 00:25:03.875
You know the company's policy.

00:25:04.291 --> 00:25:06.833
No use of religion
and no use of God! Finished!

00:25:07.208 --> 00:25:08.541
Man, you've changed!

00:25:08.916 --> 00:25:11.083
Where's the "Fighter Cherry Bajwa"?

00:25:11.416 --> 00:25:12.833
You want to see the "Fighter"?

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:16.041
Let me show you.
Take a good look.

00:25:16.458 --> 00:25:19.041
There are three marks here.

00:25:19.416 --> 00:25:21.000
And they aren't birthmarks.

00:25:21.083 --> 00:25:25.541
I ran a show against your Dad's guru,
His Holiness.

00:25:25.625 --> 00:25:29.250
His devotees shoved a trident
right here in my bum.

00:25:32.041 --> 00:25:34.541
That day I swore that
if you want to live in this country

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:35.958
don't mess with religion.

00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:45.958
We were chatting with
famed industrialist, Mr. Ratan.

00:25:46.041 --> 00:25:48.666
'The boss killed my story.'

00:25:49.208 --> 00:25:53.208
'But two weeks later,
it came back into my life.'

00:26:25.958 --> 00:26:28.541
'Donation Box'

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.666
Stop! Thief!

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:47.958
He's stealing
from the donation box!

00:26:57.958 --> 00:26:59.541
Where do you think you're going?

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.333
Don't let him go!

00:27:09.916 --> 00:27:11.083
Move!

00:27:14.375 --> 00:27:16.916
Lifting from the donation box, you fool?

00:27:17.166 --> 00:27:19.666
Yes.
- He's no thief!

00:27:19.833 --> 00:27:23.208
While donating,
my wallet fell in the box.

00:27:23.291 --> 00:27:25.333
He was getting it out for me.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:27.583
Trust me.

00:27:27.666 --> 00:27:32.375
Check for yourself.
It has 5,000 rupees in it.

00:27:48.708 --> 00:27:50.750
That's mine!
- Not anymore.

00:27:50.833 --> 00:27:53.125
Once in the box, it's donated.

00:27:53.208 --> 00:27:55.958
Now, it belongs to God.
Let them go.

00:27:57.375 --> 00:27:59.916
Dude, what the hell were you up to?

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.291
Claiming my refund.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.333
God took His fee but didn't deliver.

00:28:03.416 --> 00:28:05.125
Hang on.

00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:09.541
I saw you fish out some money,
then put some back in.

00:28:09.625 --> 00:28:14.541
I took back what I'd paid
at this branch and returned the rest.

00:28:15.416 --> 00:28:17.666
You used to wear beads and amulets, right?

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:19.875
Rejected. Gone for good!

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:22.875
Then why the stickers?

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:24.666
Self-defense!

00:28:26.125 --> 00:28:29.250
God's pictures on a public
wall prevent peeing.

00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:31.833
And on the face, prevent punches.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.000
Mitu, where are you?

00:28:40.291 --> 00:28:42.791
Please pick me up.
I've got no money to get home.

00:28:43.083 --> 00:28:44.375
I'll fill you in later.

00:28:44.666 --> 00:28:48.083
I'm at Mudrika,
outside the temple.

00:28:48.583 --> 00:28:50.541
Hurry up.
Thanks, bye.

00:28:52.125 --> 00:28:53.541
Here you go.

00:28:53.958 --> 00:28:56.416
What for?
- For the ride home.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:02.041
I feel very sad when someone
can't get to their home.

00:29:03.708 --> 00:29:07.041
Wait.
- That's all I had.

00:29:07.291 --> 00:29:09.416
I can't accept this.

00:29:09.958 --> 00:29:13.750
Why?
- Won't you need it to get home?

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:21.500
Money can't... get me home.

00:29:22.166 --> 00:29:24.208
Why? Where do you live?

00:29:32.833 --> 00:29:36.166
I live at the Agrasen step-well.

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:42.750
But in the rainy season,
I check into a lock-up.

00:29:43.416 --> 00:29:46.083
Lock-up? As in "police lock-up"?

00:29:46.166 --> 00:29:49.791
There are 122 in the city.
I yo-yo between them.

00:29:50.125 --> 00:29:53.000
And they let you check in,
like in a hotel?

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:56.250
Come.
I'll give you a demo.

00:30:00.166 --> 00:30:01.833
'Urinating here is strictly prohibited.'

00:30:05.583 --> 00:30:07.083
Just watch!

00:30:11.083 --> 00:30:13.250
Hey! Look here!

00:30:29.166 --> 00:30:30.666
You vandal!

00:30:41.583 --> 00:30:42.625
Jaggu!

00:30:45.833 --> 00:30:47.875
We have to follow that van.

00:30:47.958 --> 00:30:50.833
Who are we chasing?
- A story.

00:31:05.208 --> 00:31:08.083
Give me your wallet.
I need some cash.

00:31:09.166 --> 00:31:10.500
Hurry!
- Here.

00:31:23.958 --> 00:31:25.333
Excuse me.

00:31:26.375 --> 00:31:29.958
Yes?
- I want to go inside the lock-up.

00:31:30.083 --> 00:31:31.458
Why?

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:34.500
To meet that guy.

00:31:36.041 --> 00:31:38.708
Do you think this is the
local coffee joint?

00:31:38.791 --> 00:31:42.250
Saunter in and chillax with your buddies?

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.041
This is a lock-up, get it?

00:31:44.416 --> 00:31:47.708
Only offenders get in.

00:31:49.958 --> 00:31:52.208
Bribing is an offense!

00:31:52.916 --> 00:31:55.916
That's why I'm committing it!

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.041
I can lock you in.

00:31:57.125 --> 00:31:59.250
Yes, please.

00:32:06.375 --> 00:32:09.541
Thank you, Mr. Pandey.
- One hour, that's it.

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:15.791
I want to know your story.
Will you share it?

00:32:17.541 --> 00:32:21.333
Why?
- I'm a TV reporter. It's my job.

00:32:34.625 --> 00:32:37.583
Go on, ask me whatever you want to.

00:32:37.791 --> 00:32:38.875
Awesome!

00:32:44.125 --> 00:32:46.416
What's your name?

00:32:47.125 --> 00:32:49.125
I don't have a name.

00:32:49.208 --> 00:32:51.833
They call me PK (Tipsy) here.
Beats me why.

00:32:51.916 --> 00:32:53.750
And what do you do?

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.333
I'm an astronaut.

00:33:00.708 --> 00:33:01.958
Astronaut?

00:33:02.375 --> 00:33:04.916
You mean, those who shoot off to the moon?

00:33:05.125 --> 00:33:07.958
I've been there once.
It's kaput.

00:33:09.958 --> 00:33:11.750
Sure!

00:33:12.208 --> 00:33:13.958
So, what's your favorite planet?

00:33:14.041 --> 00:33:17.125
My own.
- I meant besides Earth.

00:33:17.208 --> 00:33:19.291
Earth is mega-kaput.

00:33:19.666 --> 00:33:21.625
I meant my own planet.

00:33:25.666 --> 00:33:29.666
It'll show up there, at night.

00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:32.666
We went bananas,

00:33:32.875 --> 00:33:37.125
when we found another planet
with people like us.

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:40.958
I was sent here
on a research mission.

00:33:41.083 --> 00:33:43.333
Boy, what a welcome I got!

00:33:43.416 --> 00:33:45.208
Somebody stole my remote.

00:33:46.333 --> 00:33:49.791
Without it,
I can't signal my people.

00:33:49.958 --> 00:33:53.125
And without a signal
they won't come for me.

00:33:53.666 --> 00:33:56.000
They'll think it's a perilous planet.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.875
That I'm dead as a dodo.

00:34:04.375 --> 00:34:05.791
Listen.
- What?

00:34:05.958 --> 00:34:07.708
Let me out.
I want to go home.

00:34:07.833 --> 00:34:12.041
Your Highness, convicts don't
decide that. Cops do.

00:34:12.125 --> 00:34:13.625
I'm not a thief!

00:34:14.125 --> 00:34:15.458
So say all the thieves.

00:34:15.625 --> 00:34:17.583
Where's Mr. Pandey?

00:34:17.708 --> 00:34:19.458
He's out, on his rounds.

00:34:20.083 --> 00:34:21.750
Mr. Pandey!

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.958
Mr. Pandey!
- Shut up, or I'll whack you!

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:49.000
You think I'm talking baloney?

00:34:49.708 --> 00:34:51.250
Obviously!

00:34:51.625 --> 00:34:53.875
Is Hindi the official language
of your planet?

00:34:53.958 --> 00:34:55.875
On my planet...

00:34:56.458 --> 00:34:59.208
There's no language on my planet.

00:34:59.458 --> 00:35:02.166
We read minds.
There's no confusion.

00:35:02.333 --> 00:35:05.250
Here, you utter something
and mean something else.

00:35:05.333 --> 00:35:07.750
A two-letter word can have
four different meanings.

00:35:08.125 --> 00:35:12.916
When you nod and say "oh,"
it means "Oh, that's cool."

00:35:14.208 --> 00:35:17.500
When your eyes pop out,
"oh!" means bad news.

00:35:17.791 --> 00:35:19.625
"Your mother-in-law is moving in."
"Oh!"

00:35:19.916 --> 00:35:21.166
Shock.

00:35:21.625 --> 00:35:24.125
When angry, you thunder.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.833
"Oh! You'll pay for that blunder!"

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.125
And when your thought is deep,
your "oh" is long!

00:35:31.916 --> 00:35:34.666
"Oh! I see!"

00:35:35.208 --> 00:35:38.458
As you hear the words,
you've got to watch the expression

00:35:38.583 --> 00:35:40.541
to get the real meaning.

00:35:40.666 --> 00:35:44.875
It's torture!
It took me six hours to learn Hindi.

00:35:45.166 --> 00:35:48.083
A whole language in six hours?

00:35:48.166 --> 00:35:50.708
No one let me hold hands.

00:35:51.208 --> 00:35:53.416
Finally, a nice lady lent her hand.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:57.416
I held it and transferred
her language into my system.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:02.333
Man, there's no limit
to your whoppers!

00:36:02.416 --> 00:36:04.875
Is your hand a USB cable,

00:36:05.208 --> 00:36:08.875
that transfers files between computers?

00:36:09.166 --> 00:36:10.625
And your clothes!

00:36:10.833 --> 00:36:12.916
Are faded jeans the rage
on your planet too?

00:36:12.999 --> 00:36:14.541
No!

00:36:14.916 --> 00:36:16.083
On my planet...

00:36:16.166 --> 00:36:20.458
No one wears clothes on my planet.

00:36:20.708 --> 00:36:23.583
Here, at first I thought...

00:36:24.125 --> 00:36:27.541
your skins were
different from ours.

00:36:28.166 --> 00:36:30.500
'Some had sparkly hides,'

00:36:30.583 --> 00:36:33.291
'some, jet black.'

00:36:34.374 --> 00:36:37.333
'Some hides were colorful.
Some, white.'

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:42.291
'Some hides were tight.
Some, baggy.'

00:36:44.291 --> 00:36:46.833
'Then one day, I found a car.'

00:36:47.333 --> 00:36:48.708
'A dancing car.'

00:36:54.958 --> 00:36:59.874
'That day I realized
our skins were the same.'

00:37:00.583 --> 00:37:05.208
'But yours are covered
with this thing called "Fashion."'

00:37:13.708 --> 00:37:16.750
'Now I could mingle.'

00:37:17.333 --> 00:37:20.166
'Yet I was mocked.'

00:37:21.791 --> 00:37:24.250
Look at him.
Half man, half woman!

00:37:26.375 --> 00:37:28.000
'Slowly, I got it.'

00:37:28.083 --> 00:37:31.041
'There is men's fashion
and there is women's fashion.'

00:37:31.875 --> 00:37:33.291
'A fashion for the day'

00:37:33.375 --> 00:37:34.708
'and a fashion for the night.'

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:36.708
'Sporting fashion'

00:37:36.791 --> 00:37:38.625
'and serving fashion.'

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.458
'With the clothes,
I found some photos.'

00:37:57.791 --> 00:38:03.250
'It hit me. These photos meant survival.'

00:38:04.041 --> 00:38:06.916
'You could swap them for food.'

00:38:07.083 --> 00:38:10.416
'So I built a portfolio
of this old man's photos.'

00:38:26.083 --> 00:38:27.916
What's this?

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.833
What are these for?

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:39.291
Why are you giving me this junk?

00:38:42.458 --> 00:38:44.875
Right! Now we're talking!

00:38:45.125 --> 00:38:46.916
Here you go.

00:38:47.708 --> 00:38:52.083
'I got it. This photo had value
on just one kind of paper.'

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.750
'On any other paper, it was worthless.'

00:38:58.916 --> 00:39:02.500
'Dancing cars were widely available
for cash and clothes.'

00:39:02.583 --> 00:39:05.791
'They were my bank,
and my tailor.'

00:39:07.541 --> 00:39:09.875
'Once, I got such a magnetic attire'

00:39:10.083 --> 00:39:13.125
'that no photos were required.'

00:39:13.208 --> 00:39:15.375
'The food was brought to me.'

00:39:15.458 --> 00:39:17.375
For you, Sir.

00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:23.625
'Now, to find my remote, I had to
learn this planet's language.'

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:26.625
'Without it, every task was a trial.'

00:39:27.333 --> 00:39:29.041
'Like telling this gentleman'

00:39:29.125 --> 00:39:32.000
'that there was a defect
in his fashion.'

00:39:39.541 --> 00:39:42.875
'I felt I had spoilt his fashion.'

00:39:44.458 --> 00:39:46.750
'So I put it back the way it was.'

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:19.666
I found him on the road.

00:40:20.416 --> 00:40:22.625
Some scumbag
hit him and bolted.

00:40:23.208 --> 00:40:24.750
Seems pretty okay.

00:40:26.541 --> 00:40:28.791
But he isn't responding.

00:40:29.416 --> 00:40:31.416
Has his eardrum called it a day?

00:40:32.083 --> 00:40:34.000
Are you deaf?

00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:37.958
He can hear alright, but he isn't talking.

00:40:38.625 --> 00:40:40.833
Seems he's in a state of shock.

00:40:41.041 --> 00:40:44.125
I'm afraid it could be memory loss.

00:40:54.875 --> 00:40:57.916
Do you remember the scumbag who hit you?

00:41:00.166 --> 00:41:02.416
Do you remember the license plate?

00:41:03.625 --> 00:41:05.000
Do you remember anything at all?

00:41:35.166 --> 00:41:38.500
Come, my friend.
Come with me.

00:41:39.666 --> 00:41:43.541
Be my guest till you get your memory back.

00:41:45.875 --> 00:41:47.958
Keep slamming your head.

00:41:48.291 --> 00:41:53.708
One knock took your memory away,
another might bring it back.

00:41:53.916 --> 00:41:55.375
I've seen it in the movies.

00:41:55.458 --> 00:41:58.000
'To figure what he was
yapping about,'

00:41:58.083 --> 00:42:01.500
'I had to hold his hand
and transfer his language into me.'

00:42:01.666 --> 00:42:04.375
Do you remember your wife...

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.208
Hey!

00:42:07.916 --> 00:42:11.250
With memory loss your gender
sense went for a toss?

00:42:11.458 --> 00:42:12.500
Wait a moment.

00:42:13.458 --> 00:42:14.958
Look at my license.

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:18.125
Sex: Male. Man.

00:42:18.208 --> 00:42:21.041
Rogue, rascal, scumbag.

00:42:22.541 --> 00:42:26.583
'To return home
I had to hold someone's hand.'

00:42:43.708 --> 00:42:47.708
<i>Here comes my zany guest</i>

00:46:36.125 --> 00:46:38.250
I feel your pain, bro.

00:46:38.833 --> 00:46:40.625
But don't go grabbing hands.

00:46:41.666 --> 00:46:45.333
You may end up in a bed,
but most likely a hospital bed.

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:53.458
Don't give up,
I know the place for you.

00:47:05.583 --> 00:47:08.875
Hand or foot, hold whatever.

00:47:09.125 --> 00:47:10.916
No one will bash you here.

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:12.291
Come.

00:47:12.583 --> 00:47:17.250
'What a neighborhood!
Virtuous, welcoming women.'

00:47:17.625 --> 00:47:21.083
'All reaching for my hand,
inviting me home.'

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:25.833
'Here I met a serene and
gentle woman, Pepper.'

00:47:25.916 --> 00:47:29.625
Pepper, take him to the honeymoon suite.

00:48:18.666 --> 00:48:20.833
'Pepper sat patiently all night.'

00:48:20.916 --> 00:48:26.166
'And for six hours, I transferred
her language files into me.'

00:48:26.583 --> 00:48:32.083
'From ABC to XYZ,
I drew in everything.'

00:48:42.458 --> 00:48:47.666
Is it your first time?
Kaput before you kicked off?

00:48:52.958 --> 00:48:54.000
Yes...

00:48:56.083 --> 00:48:58.041
Where are you from?

00:49:01.416 --> 00:49:03.875
Far, far away.

00:49:04.916 --> 00:49:07.958
From a village you'd have never heard of.

00:49:08.166 --> 00:49:10.708
But you speak my lingo.

00:49:11.166 --> 00:49:15.958
Because I learnt it from you, sister.

00:49:16.083 --> 00:49:19.958
Sister! You think this is a convent? Out!

00:49:22.083 --> 00:49:23.125
Bro!

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:26.166
Bro, wake up!

00:49:26.791 --> 00:49:28.250
Bro, wake up!

00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:30.208
Bro!

00:49:31.458 --> 00:49:32.833
You're talking!

00:49:32.916 --> 00:49:35.750
Bro, I need your help.

00:49:35.833 --> 00:49:37.958
Pepper cleared up your throat!

00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:39.708
Bro, come with me.

00:49:39.791 --> 00:49:42.750
Memory and making out
have a direct connection!

00:49:43.458 --> 00:49:47.833
We should update the doctors.
"Get laid, get well!"

00:49:47.958 --> 00:49:50.375
It's urgent, bro!

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:51.875
Okay, let's go.

00:49:58.708 --> 00:50:00.291
Stop! Stop!

00:50:00.375 --> 00:50:01.541
Stop, bro!

00:50:05.708 --> 00:50:09.583
The jerk robbed me right here.

00:50:10.083 --> 00:50:12.791
I need my chain, bro.
I must get it back.

00:50:13.041 --> 00:50:15.083
Is it precious?
- It's priceless!

00:50:15.458 --> 00:50:18.208
The thief must be a local.

00:50:18.541 --> 00:50:21.333
But he must have sold the loot in Delhi.

00:50:21.416 --> 00:50:25.083
If he sells pricey stuff here,
he'd get caught.

00:50:26.041 --> 00:50:27.958
Then I must go.

00:50:28.375 --> 00:50:30.041
Where?

00:50:30.583 --> 00:50:31.750
Delhi.

00:50:55.791 --> 00:50:57.375
Officer!
- Yeah?

00:50:57.833 --> 00:51:00.916
Somebody stole my remote control.
- Are you tipsy?

00:51:01.208 --> 00:51:04.208
You're expecting the police force
to track your TV remote?

00:51:04.666 --> 00:51:07.583
It's not a TV remote!
- Then?

00:51:08.458 --> 00:51:11.750
Can't tell you.
But it's like a chain.

00:51:11.833 --> 00:51:13.416
Really precious.

00:51:13.583 --> 00:51:15.458
Where was it stolen?
- In Mandawa.

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:18.875
The theft took place at Mandawa

00:51:18.958 --> 00:51:21.250
and you're searching for
it in Delhi, you idiot?

00:51:21.708 --> 00:51:23.541
The thief came to Delhi.

00:51:23.625 --> 00:51:25.625
So?
- So where's the thief?

00:51:25.708 --> 00:51:28.666
Blockhead!
It's a city of 15 million.

00:51:28.833 --> 00:51:30.416
Police are humans, not God.

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:33.541
'Police are humans, not God.'

00:51:35.291 --> 00:51:37.250
Only God can help you.

00:51:37.333 --> 00:51:39.708
'Only God can help you.'

00:51:39.958 --> 00:51:42.916
Surrender to God, you'll succeed.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.583
'Surrender to God.'

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:48.000
Only God knows.

00:51:48.083 --> 00:51:50.166
'Only God knows.'

00:51:50.416 --> 00:51:52.250
Ask God, not me!

00:51:52.333 --> 00:51:54.750
'Ask God!'

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.083
Trust in God, my child.

00:51:57.166 --> 00:51:58.666
'Trust in God, my child.'

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:04.208
'Who was this God?
Everyone said only He could help.'

00:52:04.833 --> 00:52:08.083
'What I saw blew my mind.'

00:52:08.166 --> 00:52:11.958
'Earthlings had figured out
who had manufactured them!'

00:52:12.416 --> 00:52:16.666
'Their creator lived with them.
He had millions of houses.'

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:23.375
'Earthlings took their problems to Him,
which He solved for a small fee.'

00:52:23.833 --> 00:52:27.458
'My planet had no such facility.'

00:52:27.791 --> 00:52:31.583
'I could not believe it!
So I decided to test it.'

00:52:34.625 --> 00:52:36.666
One take-away God.

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:40.166
Which one?
One for 20, 50, 100 or 500?

00:52:40.666 --> 00:52:44.041
What's the difference between the
one for 20 and the one for 500?

00:52:44.125 --> 00:52:46.375
Just the size.
Otherwise ditto.

00:52:46.458 --> 00:52:49.958
The one for 20 is equally
efficient, right?

00:52:50.958 --> 00:52:54.458
Okay, give me 15.
Nothing less.

00:53:07.416 --> 00:53:11.291
God, I am famished.
Get me some food please.

00:53:23.708 --> 00:53:25.333
'I went bananas!'

00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:29.750
'God actually worked!
Now I could go home.'

00:53:29.833 --> 00:53:32.833
God, my remote is stolen.

00:53:33.125 --> 00:53:35.458
Please find it.
I want to go home.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:53.708
God's battery died.
Worked once, then kaput.

00:53:54.416 --> 00:53:56.541
What do you mean?
- Stick a new battery in.

00:53:56.666 --> 00:53:57.791
Where does it go?

00:53:57.875 --> 00:54:01.000
It needs no battery.
- Then why is it off?

00:54:01.375 --> 00:54:05.000
Manufacturing defect?
- I make no defective stuff.

00:54:06.083 --> 00:54:10.833
You made this God?
- Of course! With my own hands.

00:54:11.458 --> 00:54:14.250
Did you make God or did God make you?

00:54:14.375 --> 00:54:19.625
He made us all.
I only make His statues.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.916
Why the statues?

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.666
To worship Him.
To voice our problems.

00:54:26.166 --> 00:54:30.375
Is there a transmitter inside?
How can He hear us?

00:54:31.416 --> 00:54:36.041
God needs no transmitter.
He hears directly.

00:54:36.208 --> 00:54:39.125
Directly?
Then why the statue?

00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:41.750
What's with him?

00:54:42.958 --> 00:54:47.000
Do you want to bust my business?
What's your problem?

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:49.416
My remote is stolen, Sir.

00:54:49.666 --> 00:54:53.000
I'm requesting God to find it.
But He doesn't reply.

00:54:53.458 --> 00:54:55.458
Are you tipsy?
- Meaning?

00:54:55.541 --> 00:54:58.708
You're overloading this pint-sized God.

00:54:58.875 --> 00:55:01.500
His itty-bitty feet
can't chase the thief.

00:55:01.583 --> 00:55:04.666
Brother, the big God is inside the temple.

00:55:05.125 --> 00:55:07.458
He'll run fast.

00:55:07.541 --> 00:55:11.250
Offer Him coconut and some money.
He'll deliver.

00:55:11.416 --> 00:55:13.291
That'll be 200.

00:55:18.666 --> 00:55:22.916
'Earthlings waited with fees
to get their work done.'

00:55:23.333 --> 00:55:26.041
'Two hours later,
I got the appointment.'

00:55:26.291 --> 00:55:27.666
God!

00:55:29.333 --> 00:55:31.916
God, please get my remote back.

00:55:34.708 --> 00:55:36.958
Where is it?
- Move!

00:55:37.041 --> 00:55:38.916
Wait, He didn't deliver my stuff.

00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:43.541
He didn't deliver!
I paid the fee.

00:55:43.625 --> 00:55:45.666
Your work will be done.
- But when?

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:48.208
Can't say when, but it will be done.

00:55:48.291 --> 00:55:51.125
Move!
- But when will I get it?

00:55:51.208 --> 00:55:52.708
Don't block the line, scram!

00:55:52.791 --> 00:55:55.583
If I scram, He might
give it to someone else.

00:55:55.708 --> 00:55:58.458
Are you tipsy?
- Lady, please!

00:55:58.875 --> 00:56:00.500
Where will I get my stuff?

00:56:00.583 --> 00:56:02.416
At the mental hospital!

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:06.416
What? I paid here and the
delivery at the mental hospital?

00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:08.833
Throw him out!
- At least give me a receipt.

00:56:09.708 --> 00:56:13.083
How will I claim my delivery
without a receipt?

00:56:13.166 --> 00:56:15.416
Get out!

00:56:15.541 --> 00:56:18.250
But what about my remote?
- Leave!

00:56:25.958 --> 00:56:28.875
I can't find my shoes.

00:56:29.208 --> 00:56:32.375
Somebody might've taken them.
Now you take your pick.

00:56:32.791 --> 00:56:35.041
Rotation is a routine at temples.

00:56:49.083 --> 00:56:52.875
He took the payment,
but didn't deliver.

00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:58.833
What's his name?

00:56:58.958 --> 00:57:01.125
They call Him God.
- Real name?

00:57:01.375 --> 00:57:02.916
No idea.

00:57:04.583 --> 00:57:05.833
Where does he live?

00:57:06.375 --> 00:57:08.500
In that temple.

00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:12.500
You handed him the cash?
- No. I put it in His box.

00:57:12.583 --> 00:57:15.166
Did he say he'd do the job?
- He says nothing.

00:57:15.291 --> 00:57:16.958
Is he mute?

00:57:17.041 --> 00:57:18.833
Perhaps...
Maybe.

00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:21.000
Oh.

00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:23.791
Describe him.

00:57:27.291 --> 00:57:28.750
Ditto.

00:57:31.166 --> 00:57:33.625
But bigger.

00:57:34.583 --> 00:57:35.916
Come closer.

00:57:37.791 --> 00:57:39.208
Are you tipsy?

00:57:40.333 --> 00:57:42.750
Yes. But how do you all know?

00:57:42.833 --> 00:57:46.375
Do you think I'm a jackass?
I've been a cop for 20 years.

00:57:46.541 --> 00:57:49.666
I can tell in a snap
who's tipsy and who's not.

00:57:50.625 --> 00:57:53.583
Kirpal, frisk him.

00:57:55.166 --> 00:57:57.625
Let me have a look.
- Sir.

00:57:58.958 --> 00:58:00.958
Dr. D'Mello.

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:06.375
Doc, why get so buzzed
that you forget your faith?

00:58:06.541 --> 00:58:10.375
Mistook temple for a church!
Wanna rouse a riot?

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.500
Go to church.
To your own God.

00:58:17.458 --> 00:58:18.500
Church?

00:59:07.708 --> 00:59:09.250
Get out of here!

00:59:09.333 --> 00:59:12.458
My stuff! My remote!
- Get out!

00:59:12.541 --> 00:59:15.833
God was crucified for your sins.
Ungrateful man!

00:59:16.125 --> 00:59:20.291
Crucified! When?

00:59:20.541 --> 00:59:22.208
2,000 years ago.

00:59:22.708 --> 00:59:24.291
For your sins.

00:59:24.416 --> 00:59:27.708
What did I do?
I just got here.

00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:31.333
Are you tipsy?
- Yes!

00:59:31.458 --> 00:59:34.375
God is watching you.
He's watching your behavior.

00:59:34.916 --> 00:59:36.458
Where?

00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:38.125
Where is God?

00:59:38.833 --> 00:59:40.125
What's in that mug?

00:59:40.208 --> 00:59:41.291
Wine.

00:59:41.875 --> 00:59:45.750
'Wine!
Now I got it!'

00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:49.291
'God was bored of coconut water.'

00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:53.333
'Now He preferred wine.
But wine was expensive.'

00:59:53.416 --> 00:59:55.541
'So I had to muster money.'

00:59:57.125 --> 01:00:01.875
'I got some from the dancing car.
And some from a gentleman'

01:00:01.958 --> 01:00:04.875
'who held out a bowl of dole everyday.'

01:00:05.125 --> 01:00:07.458
'You could withdraw as per your need.'

01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:30.666
Sir, is there a God's house nearby?

01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:32.166
Right there.

01:00:32.916 --> 01:00:37.708
"Preacher, let me drink"

01:00:38.625 --> 01:00:42.375
"in God's abode..."

01:00:45.666 --> 01:00:52.958
"Or show me a place
where there is no God...'

01:00:53.208 --> 01:00:56.041
Stop!
What's that?

01:00:56.125 --> 01:00:58.041
Wine, for God.

01:00:58.458 --> 01:00:59.583
Where is He?

01:01:40.458 --> 01:01:42.708
'This lady looked very sad.'

01:01:43.041 --> 01:01:45.791
'To know why,
I grabbed her hand.'

01:01:46.166 --> 01:01:48.625
Hitting on a widow, you lech!

01:01:49.875 --> 01:01:50.916
Widow?
How do you know?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.250
Don't you see she's clad in white?

01:02:05.208 --> 01:02:07.708
Is everything fine?
- Everything is fine.

01:02:12.708 --> 01:02:15.208
I am so sorry your husband's dead.

01:02:15.291 --> 01:02:16.833
What?
- When?

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.041
How do I know?
You are clad in white.

01:02:20.375 --> 01:02:22.041
Brides wear white!

01:02:22.125 --> 01:02:24.708
No, widows wear white.

01:02:25.083 --> 01:02:27.166
Widows wear black, stupid!
- Got it?

01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:42.166
Are your husbands no more?
- Oh, God!

01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:44.791
I'm alive, you moron!
I'll whack you!

01:02:46.416 --> 01:02:50.166
'After many whacks, I learnt
that there wasn't one God.'

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.166
'There were many Gods.'

01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:54.666
'Each with His own set of rules.'

01:02:55.041 --> 01:02:57.375
'Each God had come up
with His own company.'

01:02:57.958 --> 01:02:59.958
'They called it religion.'

01:03:00.375 --> 01:03:03.458
'Each company had its agents.'

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:08.791
'All Earthlings belonged to some religion'

01:03:09.125 --> 01:03:13.750
'and followed the God
of that religion alone.'

01:03:14.333 --> 01:03:17.958
'What was my religion?
Who was my God?'

01:03:18.583 --> 01:03:21.416
'To find the remote
I had to know my God.'

01:03:37.083 --> 01:03:39.083
What are you doing?

01:03:39.291 --> 01:03:40.916
Where is the label?

01:03:41.125 --> 01:03:43.000
What label?

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.166
The religion label.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.625
How do you know which
company he belongs to?

01:03:49.208 --> 01:03:50.708
Where does God label them?

01:04:00.833 --> 01:04:03.500
'Finding my religion was tough.'

01:04:04.041 --> 01:04:08.833
'So I decided to worship all Gods.'

01:04:09.166 --> 01:04:12.875
'Perhaps, one of them would
be my God, who'd help me.'

01:04:12.958 --> 01:04:19.458
"It's You Who governs
the world I hear."

01:04:19.708 --> 01:04:25.708
"Do listen to my plea.
My home beckons me."

01:04:25.958 --> 01:04:31.291
"God where are You?"

01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:38.750
"Tell me, where are You?"

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:46.500
"To sanity You guide back
those who've lost their way..."

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:52.666
"I too am completely lost.
Guide me too, I pray."

01:04:52.833 --> 01:04:57.916
"God where are You?"

01:04:59.625 --> 01:05:05.583
"Tell me, where are You?"

01:05:33.125 --> 01:05:36.458
"Shall I worship You in temples?"

01:05:36.541 --> 01:05:39.875
"In mosques do my faith I show?"

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.583
"Or to a Gurudwara
would You like me to go?"

01:05:46.666 --> 01:05:53.208
"Temples and churches,
I looked everywhere."

01:05:53.375 --> 01:05:59.791
"My hope now,
has turned to despair."

01:06:00.083 --> 01:06:05.291
"My hope now,
has turned to despair."

01:06:06.875 --> 01:06:12.916
"My hope now,
has turned to despair."

01:06:17.125 --> 01:06:22.958
"Not a single ritual
did I ever flout..."

01:06:24.083 --> 01:06:29.916
"Like millions around
I submit without a doubt"

01:06:30.375 --> 01:06:35.333
"God where are You?"

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:42.125
"Tell me, where are You?"

01:07:10.583 --> 01:07:17.000
"You have many names
And many faces too"

01:07:17.375 --> 01:07:23.458
"I've walked each of the myriad
paths which lead to You."

01:07:24.083 --> 01:07:30.666
"In no shrine did I find You."

01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:36.333
"What else should I do to find you?
Give a clue..."

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:43.208
"What else should I do to find you?
Give a clue..."

01:07:44.375 --> 01:07:49.750
"What else should I do to find you?
Give a clue..."

01:07:54.666 --> 01:08:00.583
"I blindly follow and
with reverence treasure"

01:08:01.541 --> 01:08:07.333
"Your every whim and fancy
in more than ample measure."

01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:12.416
"God, where are You?"

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:18.958
"Tell me, where are You?"

01:08:21.166 --> 01:08:26.416
"God, where are You?"

01:08:27.916 --> 01:08:34.208
"Tell me, where are You?"

01:08:43.416 --> 01:08:45.291
God, I'm all confused.

01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:53.000
What's my fault?
Why can't my voice reach you?

01:08:54.583 --> 01:08:57.166
Understand my plight.

01:08:57.583 --> 01:08:58.958
Give me some guidance.

01:09:00.166 --> 01:09:01.208
Please.

01:09:04.541 --> 01:09:06.625
Shall I talk to you with my hands clasped,

01:09:07.291 --> 01:09:11.625
or on bent knees,
head to the ground?

01:09:14.666 --> 01:09:16.375
Do I wake you with temple bells?

01:09:17.208 --> 01:09:19.166
Or call out on a loudspeaker?

01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:25.583
The Geeta, the Quran,
or the Bible, what do I read?

01:09:26.125 --> 01:09:30.166
Your different managers
say different things.

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:35.333
Some insist fasting on Monday,
others urge on Tuesday.

01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:40.625
Some forbid food after sunset,
some after sunrise.

01:09:41.416 --> 01:09:45.333
Some say, worship the cow.
Others say, slaughter her.

01:09:45.916 --> 01:09:51.458
Some send me barefoot to the temple.
Some, wearing shoes to the church.

01:09:51.916 --> 01:09:54.583
What is right and what is wrong?

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.375
I am clueless.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.666
I'm at a breaking point.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.166
I want to go home.

01:10:06.958 --> 01:10:10.875
I'll do whatever you ask.
Just get me home.

01:10:11.333 --> 01:10:13.125
Please.

01:10:14.666 --> 01:10:16.333
Say something.

01:10:17.541 --> 01:10:19.625
At least one of you...

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:22.083
give me an answer.

01:10:22.833 --> 01:10:23.875
Please.

01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:27.291
Please.

01:10:29.375 --> 01:10:31.291
Please.

01:10:40.625 --> 01:10:43.583
'Missing: God.'

01:10:52.166 --> 01:10:53.458
'Missing: God.'

01:11:39.041 --> 01:11:40.625
Why the lock, man?

01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:42.791
I won't let you go today!

01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:44.666
Open it!
It's my entry!

01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:48.624
Lord Shiva, the slayer of sins,
who fears none...

01:11:50.791 --> 01:11:53.749
Who are you?
- Don't you recognize me?

01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:56.083
I'm Tipsy!

01:11:57.833 --> 01:12:00.208
Where the hell is the security?

01:12:00.291 --> 01:12:03.375
Do I perform for drunkards in the toilet?

01:12:05.625 --> 01:12:07.875
Unlock the door!
Right now!

01:12:07.958 --> 01:12:09.625
First give me my remote!

01:12:09.708 --> 01:12:12.958
What remote?
- The remote of my spaceship.

01:12:13.416 --> 01:12:14.458
Spaceship?

01:12:14.624 --> 01:12:18.041
Did you forget?
For the zillionth time,

01:12:18.458 --> 01:12:21.291
I'm not from here.
I'm from a far off planet.

01:12:21.416 --> 01:12:22.583
Put this away!

01:12:22.875 --> 01:12:26.750
Give me my remote,
and I go home. Got it?

01:12:27.041 --> 01:12:30.458
Brother, let me go.
I've little kids at home.

01:12:30.541 --> 01:12:32.958
I know!
You fathered two Gods.

01:12:33.041 --> 01:12:35.624
Both are centuries old.
They can be home alone.

01:12:35.708 --> 01:12:38.541
First my remote,
then your family reunion.

01:12:39.375 --> 01:12:40.916
Oh, God, please save me!

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.666
There's a God above you, too?

01:12:42.749 --> 01:12:44.125
Lord Shiva, help!

01:12:44.208 --> 01:12:45.250
Where is he?

01:12:47.958 --> 01:12:51.583
Now presenting the dance of Shiva,
the Fearless!

01:12:51.666 --> 01:12:52.791
Help!

01:12:56.333 --> 01:12:57.374
Help!

01:13:04.291 --> 01:13:06.291
Help!

01:13:08.041 --> 01:13:09.125
Help!

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.541
Hail Lord Shiva...

01:13:48.125 --> 01:13:52.583
Hail Lord Shiva.
- Hail Lord Shiva!

01:13:52.666 --> 01:13:58.291
I was meditating on the
snowy peaks of the Himalayas...

01:13:58.666 --> 01:14:01.875
and suddenly, there was light!

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.166
Dazzling light!

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:10.500
It came from a bead
lying in the snow.

01:14:11.125 --> 01:14:15.125
'I shut my eyes and invoked God.'

01:14:15.708 --> 01:14:18.791
'Next moment,
I was connected.'

01:14:18.875 --> 01:14:21.875
I said, "God, enlighten me.

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:24.166
What is this miraculous object,

01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:27.666
that is warm even in this biting cold?"

01:14:28.083 --> 01:14:29.416
God said,

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:34.375
"It's a divine bead
from Lord Shiva's necklace.

01:14:34.458 --> 01:14:40.291
Take it and enshrine it
in a grand temple.

01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:46.583
Sighting this bead
will heal all suffering."

01:14:46.666 --> 01:14:49.875
Hail Lord Shiva.

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.541
Are you ready for the sighting of...

01:14:53.250 --> 01:14:56.375
the divine bead from
Lord Shiva's necklace?

01:14:57.291 --> 01:14:59.833
Hail Lord Shiva!

01:14:59.958 --> 01:15:04.583
Hail Lord Shiva.

01:15:04.916 --> 01:15:09.416
Hail Lord Shiva!

01:15:18.041 --> 01:15:20.833
Hail Lord Shiva!

01:15:20.916 --> 01:15:22.916
Hail Lord Shiva!

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.166
Stop.
- Let him through.

01:15:25.333 --> 01:15:28.208
He's awed by the sight.

01:15:28.291 --> 01:15:30.291
Come.
- Hail Lord Shiva.

01:15:30.375 --> 01:15:33.750
Not there, child.
Come here.

01:15:33.833 --> 01:15:35.750
Express your ecstasy.

01:15:35.833 --> 01:15:38.291
Hail Lord Shiva.

01:15:38.375 --> 01:15:41.875
Hail Lord Shiva.

01:15:42.208 --> 01:15:44.625
God, where are you?
Please step out,

01:15:44.708 --> 01:15:46.708
'I want to thank you.'

01:15:48.166 --> 01:15:49.708
He's right here.

01:15:50.166 --> 01:15:51.875
I met Him in the toilet.

01:15:51.958 --> 01:15:54.625
I asked for my property
and He bolted.

01:15:54.916 --> 01:15:56.750
I thought He vamoosed.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.583
But, no!
He led me to my property.

01:16:00.875 --> 01:16:03.333
Hail Lord Shiva.

01:16:04.291 --> 01:16:06.375
This isn't Lord Shiva's bead.

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:09.416
It's my property,
misdelivered to you.

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.500
Your bead must be
misdelivered too.

01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:13.166
Ask God, He is right here.

01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:16.583
God, do step forward, clarify.

01:16:18.583 --> 01:16:21.291
Anyway, I'll take my property.

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:27.458
That's mine!
Why are you stopping me?

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:33.541
Hail Lord Shiva.
- Hail Lord Shiva!

01:16:45.041 --> 01:16:49.500
"A traveler of dreams..."

01:16:50.291 --> 01:16:53.875
"Neither a devotee, nor an unbeliever..."

01:16:55.416 --> 01:16:59.833
"Oh Lord, tell me..."

01:17:00.708 --> 01:17:04.500
"Where am I?"

01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:10.333
"Why do you play this game
of hide and seek with me?"

01:17:10.833 --> 01:17:14.875
"Please take me home."

01:17:15.166 --> 01:17:20.166
"My heart is lost."

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:25.208
"My heart is lost."

01:17:32.125 --> 01:17:37.708
Since when have you felt
that you're from another planet?

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:46.125
Listen, you need to see a psychiatrist.

01:17:47.125 --> 01:17:50.083
Time up! That's all you
get for 500 rupees.

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:51.208
Just a minute.

01:17:58.125 --> 01:18:00.125
Here's my card.

01:18:00.833 --> 01:18:04.916
My number's on it. If you wish,
I'll get you an appointment.

01:18:05.333 --> 01:18:07.833
Feel free to call. Okay?

01:18:09.083 --> 01:18:13.416
Okay.

01:18:12.916 --> 01:18:15.041
Thank you, Mr. Pandey.

01:18:16.666 --> 01:18:19.708
You think my story is a lie, don't you?

01:18:21.833 --> 01:18:26.041
Then go back to
the suicidal dog, Nikku!

01:18:26.625 --> 01:18:29.125
That's the story for you.

01:18:35.833 --> 01:18:39.500
Mr. Pandey,
I need to go back in for 2 minutes.

01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:43.458
Quit going in and out!

01:18:43.875 --> 01:18:48.625
Another 500 and he's all yours.

01:18:48.708 --> 01:18:52.500
When did I mention Nikku,
the suicidal dog?

01:18:52.875 --> 01:18:54.583
You didn't.

01:18:54.750 --> 01:18:56.791
So how do you know?

01:18:57.083 --> 01:19:02.000
When you held my hand,
I read your thoughts.

01:19:02.916 --> 01:19:04.708
You thought,
"This story is dead.

01:19:04.791 --> 01:19:06.416
I got to live with the Nikku story."

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:09.500
Don't lie!
I must have mentioned it.

01:19:09.583 --> 01:19:13.083
I cannot lie.
Lying needs language.

01:19:13.166 --> 01:19:15.666
And on my planet, we hold
hands and read minds.

01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:19.000
Give me your hand.
- No way.

01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:21.666
Try it.
- Help me, son.

01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:27.125
My wife's ill. The hospital wants
a deposit of 10,000 rupees.

01:19:27.208 --> 01:19:31.458
I'm short of 500.
Please help me...

01:19:31.541 --> 01:19:33.166
Let me give you some money.

01:19:34.375 --> 01:19:36.333
Here.
- Give me your address.

01:19:36.458 --> 01:19:37.916
I'll courier a check.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.500
The courier won't reach my home.
Please keep it.

01:19:41.583 --> 01:19:43.041
Thank you.

01:19:43.958 --> 01:19:45.083
Sir.

01:19:45.708 --> 01:19:48.750
Here's another 100.
For the tip.

01:19:50.916 --> 01:19:53.000
Bless you.

01:19:54.125 --> 01:19:58.000
This proves that you're no mind reader.

01:19:58.333 --> 01:20:03.416
You got conned.
There is no hospital around here.

01:20:03.625 --> 01:20:04.916
I know!

01:20:05.125 --> 01:20:07.958
He's gifting his wife a five star dinner.

01:20:08.041 --> 01:20:10.166
It's her 75th birthday.

01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:13.041
She has never been to a fancy place.

01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:16.083
He's been saving from
his pension for months.

01:20:16.208 --> 01:20:19.583
She ordered ice-cream
and his budget went kaput.

01:20:19.666 --> 01:20:22.541
With an excuse to go to the restroom,
he ran out for some bucks.

01:20:22.625 --> 01:20:24.166
Another yarn!

01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:28.458
Ma'am, on my planet, we don't lie!

01:20:29.416 --> 01:20:31.166
Anyway, it's up to you.

01:21:31.625 --> 01:21:33.208
Here.
- Thank you, Sir.

01:21:33.291 --> 01:21:36.083
One moment. Tip him.

01:21:36.166 --> 01:21:40.791
Why hold back?
It's your birthday!

01:21:40.875 --> 01:21:41.958
Thank you.

01:22:11.208 --> 01:22:13.083
'Contact: Tipsy,
The Agrasen Step-Well.'

01:22:37.291 --> 01:22:39.500
I told you.
On my planet, we don't lie.

01:22:42.541 --> 01:22:43.916
Hope you haven't told anyone...

01:22:51.791 --> 01:22:54.041
Have you told anyone that you're an alien?

01:22:54.125 --> 01:22:55.291
No way!

01:22:55.500 --> 01:23:00.208
They'd lock me in a lab,
and rip me up for research!

01:23:02.083 --> 01:23:04.875
How come you told me?

01:23:06.416 --> 01:23:08.041
Ever since I set foot on this planet

01:23:08.166 --> 01:23:11.333
everyone has taken money from me.

01:23:11.541 --> 01:23:15.208
You were the first to give up
5000 rupees for me.

01:23:15.625 --> 01:23:19.208
I thought you are a good egg.
I could trust you.

01:23:22.541 --> 01:23:24.791
I'll get your remote back, Tipsy.

01:23:26.250 --> 01:23:27.791
How?

01:23:28.125 --> 01:23:32.291
I haven't figured it out yet,
but you'll go back home.

01:24:21.375 --> 01:24:23.458
What are you goggling at?

01:24:23.958 --> 01:24:25.000
You.

01:24:25.958 --> 01:24:28.250
Aliens don't drop by my house everyday.

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:33.791
Does everyone on your planet
have stick-out ears?

01:24:36.541 --> 01:24:40.166
Yup, ditto.
- And everyone roams around naked?

01:24:40.791 --> 01:24:42.000
Isn't it weird?

01:24:43.166 --> 01:24:46.750
That crow is naked.
Does it look weird?

01:24:47.041 --> 01:24:49.333
But if it dons a tie,
it'd definitely look weird.

01:24:52.416 --> 01:24:55.500
Tipsy, I was up all night...

01:24:56.333 --> 01:24:59.500
thinking how to get your remote back.

01:25:00.166 --> 01:25:01.125
Hello?

01:25:01.208 --> 01:25:04.041
'Hello. Connect to Balbir Singh.
Room no. 4.'

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:05.833
Wrong number!

01:25:06.125 --> 01:25:07.750
'Isn't it the Fortis Hospital?'

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.833
You've been dialing the wrong
number since yesterday.

01:25:10.916 --> 01:25:14.666
'Impossible!
I can't be wrong every time!'

01:25:15.791 --> 01:25:17.500
So how do we get the remote?

01:25:21.958 --> 01:25:24.791
'Hello, connect to Balbir Singh.
Room no. 4.'

01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:28.041
Sorry, Sir. You're late.
- 'What happened?'

01:25:28.125 --> 01:25:29.958
Balbir died this morning.

01:25:30.375 --> 01:25:34.625
'What! How can a piles surgery be fatal?'

01:25:34.875 --> 01:25:37.458
It is embarrassing,
but don't worry.

01:25:37.666 --> 01:25:39.875
We'll have "heart attack" written
on the death certificate.

01:25:39.958 --> 01:25:42.083
It shouldn't spoil
the family's reputation.

01:25:42.291 --> 01:25:44.500
Come for the body.
- 'On my way.'

01:25:44.666 --> 01:25:46.041
Okay, bye.
- 'Get the car...'

01:25:49.375 --> 01:25:50.875
Why did you say that?

01:25:51.083 --> 01:25:52.583
I'm doling out joy.

01:25:52.666 --> 01:25:56.750
When he finds his friend alive,
imagine his joy!

01:25:56.833 --> 01:25:57.875
What!

01:25:57.958 --> 01:26:02.500
I was sick of his calls.
So I played a prank.

01:26:02.666 --> 01:26:05.916
A prank?
- Tipsy, I was just kidding!

01:26:12.708 --> 01:26:13.833
Oh!

01:26:15.333 --> 01:26:18.625
I got it! Someone is playing pranks.

01:26:18.958 --> 01:26:21.458
When His Holiness dials God,

01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:24.958
cocking his head,
"God, enlighten me."

01:26:25.291 --> 01:26:27.458
His calls are going to a wrong number.

01:26:28.166 --> 01:26:30.750
Someone out there is playing pranks.

01:26:30.958 --> 01:26:35.041
The real God wouldn't
call my remote a bead.

01:26:36.416 --> 01:26:43.083
Looks like the phone lines
to God have gone kaput.

01:26:43.375 --> 01:26:45.833
All calls to God are going
to a wrong number!

01:26:46.208 --> 01:26:48.333
As in?
- I always used to think,

01:26:48.666 --> 01:26:52.041
why would the real God
give such weird solutions?

01:26:52.458 --> 01:26:56.333
Why would He say,
"come rolling to me, then I'll help you!"?

01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:59.125
Aren't we God's children?

01:26:59.416 --> 01:27:04.625
Would a father make his kids
roll for help?

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.416
I'm sure your dad would've never said

01:27:06.541 --> 01:27:10.125
"Kiddo, you want a new dress?
Start rolling!"

01:27:10.875 --> 01:27:15.333
Why would He want to bathe in milk?
That's illogical!

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:22.041
And if these calls went to
the real God, what would He say?

01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:27.000
He'd say, "millions of my children
are starving on the streets.

01:27:27.291 --> 01:27:30.333
Give them milk.
Don't give me a lactose shower."

01:27:30.791 --> 01:27:34.375
I'm sure someone's playing
pranks, like you did.

01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:37.791
'Tipsy thought His Holiness
was a victim of pranks.'

01:27:38.041 --> 01:27:39.958
'I didn't clear his confusion...'

01:27:40.291 --> 01:27:43.125
'for a crazy idea was forming in my head.'

01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:46.500
'An idea that would
get back Tipsy's remote.'

01:27:48.291 --> 01:27:49.375
Who's this Tipsy?

01:27:49.916 --> 01:27:51.833
That's a mystery.

01:27:52.083 --> 01:27:54.500
But the way he sees this world is unique.

01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:58.500
As in?
- If he saw you smoking,

01:27:58.791 --> 01:28:01.333
he'd call the cops to say
that you're attempting suicide.

01:28:01.541 --> 01:28:02.375
Why?

01:28:02.458 --> 01:28:04.583
The pack says "Smoking kills"
yet you puff away.

01:28:06.833 --> 01:28:08.833
So what's the big idea?

01:28:10.583 --> 01:28:11.958
Face-off.

01:28:12.291 --> 01:28:15.125
Between Tipsy and His Holiness.

01:28:15.541 --> 01:28:18.208
We'll take the face-off to TV.

01:28:18.750 --> 01:28:21.083
Ratings will go through the roof!
- Jaggu.

01:28:21.875 --> 01:28:24.666
I have three trident marks
on my right bum.

01:28:25.083 --> 01:28:27.750
You want three more on
my left for balance?

01:28:29.250 --> 01:28:34.250
Tipsy won't fight His Holiness,
but gently explain, that...

01:28:34.666 --> 01:28:37.708
his calls to God
are going to a wrong number.

01:28:38.208 --> 01:28:40.625
His Holiness will be stumped.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.208
Tipsy's here.
Please meet him once.

01:28:46.625 --> 01:28:49.125
I bet his queries will baffle you.

01:29:01.666 --> 01:29:03.541
Excuse me, you dropped this.

01:29:08.666 --> 01:29:10.875
That's not mine.

01:29:12.166 --> 01:29:14.333
Kamasutra condoms,
strawberry flavor.

01:29:16.333 --> 01:29:19.416
I hate strawberries, man.
Why don't you ask others?

01:29:19.541 --> 01:29:22.041
It's not mine.
Buzzed bozo!

01:29:24.333 --> 01:29:25.375
Is this yours, Ma'am?

01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:30.333
Check your purse if it's missing.
- Shameless cad!

01:29:32.041 --> 01:29:34.708
Has to be yours.
- No, not mine.

01:29:34.791 --> 01:29:36.708
Tipsy, it's his.

01:29:37.166 --> 01:29:40.500
Ask him about it. Come on in.

01:29:42.166 --> 01:29:43.208
Come in.

01:29:45.916 --> 01:29:47.125
What's this?

01:29:48.250 --> 01:29:49.833
It's a condom.

01:29:50.083 --> 01:29:53.625
What does it do?
- It controls the world's population.

01:29:55.458 --> 01:29:56.500
How?

01:29:56.958 --> 01:30:01.333
It has to be worn... while having sex.

01:30:03.625 --> 01:30:06.833
How does your wearing it
control the world's population?

01:30:06.916 --> 01:30:10.166
Not just me.
Millions wear it.

01:30:10.333 --> 01:30:12.333
And they all borrow it from you?

01:30:12.875 --> 01:30:14.125
Everyone has it.

01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:17.958
I've a question.
- Go on, Tipsy.

01:30:18.750 --> 01:30:23.125
When money is dropped, all run for it.

01:30:23.250 --> 01:30:27.583
But when a condom is dropped,
all run away from it. Why?

01:30:29.083 --> 01:30:32.333
Sex is a very private matter.
- Why?

01:30:32.791 --> 01:30:35.708
You don't announce it to the world saying
"I'm having sex today."

01:30:37.041 --> 01:30:41.541
But, at weddings,
with fireworks and music bands,

01:30:41.875 --> 01:30:45.208
why do they tell the whole town,
"I'm having sex today"?

01:30:49.083 --> 01:30:50.500
What's the matter?

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:55.583
I have no answer for you
but I have a job for you.

01:30:59.666 --> 01:31:02.166
Let's beat it before
he changes his mind.

01:31:05.083 --> 01:31:09.000
Shield your holy bum, Your Holiness.
My trident is on its way.

01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:17.208
Tipsy, here His Holiness
connects his devotees to God

01:31:17.291 --> 01:31:19.166
for solutions to their woes.

01:31:19.541 --> 01:31:22.375
Listen carefully to his calls.

01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:28.875
If you think the calls are going
to a wrong number, alert him.

01:31:29.208 --> 01:31:32.750
Will that get me my remote?
- Once he realizes

01:31:32.875 --> 01:31:37.500
that the bead story is a prank,
he'll return your remote.

01:31:37.625 --> 01:31:40.333
Good plan. Let's go.

01:31:42.083 --> 01:31:45.083
'To build a home for someone
is a holy deed.'

01:31:45.166 --> 01:31:49.833
To build a home for God
is the holiest deed.

01:31:50.208 --> 01:31:52.458
So donate for the temple.

01:31:53.125 --> 01:31:55.958
And see your woes flee.

01:31:56.708 --> 01:32:00.250
Son, voice your woe.

01:32:01.208 --> 01:32:02.625
Your Holiness,

01:32:03.250 --> 01:32:05.791
my wife's been paralyzed
for six months.

01:32:06.125 --> 01:32:09.791
The doctors have given up.
What should I--

01:32:11.375 --> 01:32:12.916
God...

01:32:13.666 --> 01:32:15.041
enlighten me.

01:32:22.125 --> 01:32:23.541
Yes.

01:32:26.833 --> 01:32:28.250
What place?

01:32:33.875 --> 01:32:35.500
What transport?

01:32:38.458 --> 01:32:40.750
Your wish is our command.

01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:46.083
Have you heard of
the Rathong glacier?

01:32:46.166 --> 01:32:47.375
No.

01:32:47.791 --> 01:32:52.250
It's in the Himalayas.
Take a train to Silliguri...

01:32:53.083 --> 01:32:55.875
then a bus to Gangtok.

01:32:56.666 --> 01:33:01.208
Then an eight day trek.

01:33:01.875 --> 01:33:06.000
You'll reach a grand temple.

01:33:07.333 --> 01:33:10.541
Pray there,
your problem will be solved.

01:33:10.666 --> 01:33:13.125
Wrong number!
This is a wrong number!

01:33:13.458 --> 01:33:15.291
What?
- Wrong number!

01:33:15.625 --> 01:33:20.958
Your Holiness, your phone line
to God has gone kaput.

01:33:21.583 --> 01:33:23.791
Your calls are going to
a wrong number

01:33:24.041 --> 01:33:27.833
and a fake God is playing pranks.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.208
What are you trying to say?

01:33:31.541 --> 01:33:34.416
I'll explain.
Aren't we God's children?

01:33:35.083 --> 01:33:36.125
Yes, so?

01:33:36.250 --> 01:33:39.958
If your kid's in trouble
and asks for a solution

01:33:40.375 --> 01:33:43.041
would you help him promptly,
or would you say,

01:33:43.208 --> 01:33:46.541
"Kiddo, I've another house
2,000 miles away.

01:33:46.708 --> 01:33:49.750
Come there and tell me
the same problem again.

01:33:50.041 --> 01:33:52.458
Then I'll solve it."
What bull!

01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:54.750
If the call went to the real God,

01:33:54.875 --> 01:33:58.166
He'd say, "Son, tend to your ailing wife.

01:33:58.375 --> 01:34:00.708
Don't run after me.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.958
After death, you'll come to me anyway.

01:34:04.125 --> 01:34:07.750
Give her your time now."
Right?

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.541
I can prove it's a prank.

01:34:14.708 --> 01:34:18.000
Call this fake God again and ask,

01:34:18.166 --> 01:34:20.833
what's the guarantee
that she will get well.

01:34:20.958 --> 01:34:25.208
Sir, don't leave her side
till you get it in writing.

01:34:25.291 --> 01:34:28.375
Just call, and clear all the doubts.

01:34:29.250 --> 01:34:32.625
It's time for His Holiness' holy silence.

01:34:33.833 --> 01:34:38.125
"Praise be to God"

01:34:38.291 --> 01:34:42.041
"Glory be to God"

01:34:42.208 --> 01:34:45.666
"The woes of your devotees..."

01:34:45.916 --> 01:34:50.958
This fake God is passing off
my property as a holy bead.

01:34:55.708 --> 01:34:57.625
He is no God.
He is a fraud.

01:34:59.041 --> 01:35:01.125
'He is a fraud!'

01:35:01.208 --> 01:35:04.875
'God doesn't talk to us mortals.'

01:35:05.458 --> 01:35:09.208
'He communicates
through His managers.'

01:35:09.583 --> 01:35:12.250
'Tipsy has raised a big question.
- What?'

01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:17.708
'Is God really talking
to the managers?'

01:35:17.833 --> 01:35:18.708
'No.'

01:35:18.791 --> 01:35:23.166
'So where do these commands come from?'

01:35:23.416 --> 01:35:27.000
'From a wrong number!
- So what should the public do?'

01:35:27.208 --> 01:35:31.000
'Till the phone lines are fixed,
don't depend on God's managers.'

01:35:31.083 --> 01:35:33.708
'Help each other in difficult times.'

01:35:34.083 --> 01:35:35.416
'A great tip from Tipsy.'

01:35:35.833 --> 01:35:41.166
'Don't rely on God's managers.'

01:35:41.291 --> 01:35:43.916
'Rely on each other.'

01:35:46.541 --> 01:35:51.375
Hail Lord Shiva.
- Hail Lord Shiva.

01:35:51.583 --> 01:35:53.708
Tipsy says that you
shouldn't build the temple,

01:35:53.791 --> 01:35:56.166
because that bead belongs to him.

01:35:56.250 --> 01:35:57.708
What's in your pocket?

01:36:00.833 --> 01:36:03.583
Do you smoke?
- Yes.

01:36:03.875 --> 01:36:08.041
Do you consume alcohol?
- Occasionally.

01:36:08.208 --> 01:36:11.416
You smoke cigarettes,
consume alcohol

01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:15.083
despite knowing their fatal effects.

01:36:15.916 --> 01:36:18.208
Governments permit these poisons,

01:36:18.458 --> 01:36:23.791
factories manufacture them,
stores sell them.

01:36:23.875 --> 01:36:26.208
And nobody questions this.

01:36:26.416 --> 01:36:29.000
'But in this sacred land'

01:36:29.125 --> 01:36:33.875
'of Lord Rama and Krishna'

01:36:33.958 --> 01:36:36.791
where I wish to build a temple...

01:36:37.541 --> 01:36:39.625
why am I being asked these questions?

01:36:40.208 --> 01:36:44.125
Why not question the man

01:36:44.208 --> 01:36:47.625
who is trying to stall this temple?

01:36:47.916 --> 01:36:49.541
'Who's this Tipsy?'

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.041
'What's his real name?'

01:36:53.375 --> 01:36:57.041
Why is he hiding it? Is he a Muslim?

01:36:58.208 --> 01:37:02.458
If you must question,
go ask Tipsy

01:37:02.583 --> 01:37:04.333
what is his religion?

01:37:04.625 --> 01:37:08.375
'Find out his religion.
Find out his faith.'

01:37:11.708 --> 01:37:14.666
Centuries ago,
Mohammad of Ghazni...

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:17.541
came and destroyed our temples.

01:37:18.208 --> 01:37:22.708
Today, another invader
wants to repeat history.

01:37:22.875 --> 01:37:24.041
But we won't allow...

01:37:50.958 --> 01:37:55.416
Your God asks my religion.
Let's ask Him

01:37:55.541 --> 01:37:58.083
the religions of these people.

01:37:58.166 --> 01:38:02.458
What nonsense!
- Call up your God!

01:38:02.541 --> 01:38:07.083
Why bother God?
I'll tell you.

01:38:07.333 --> 01:38:09.291
This one is a Hindu.
He's a Christian.

01:38:09.416 --> 01:38:11.291
Sikh, Jain

01:38:11.416 --> 01:38:14.333
and... she is of your religion.

01:38:15.958 --> 01:38:18.625
Enlighten him.

01:38:19.083 --> 01:38:22.500
Hello, I'm Sikh.

01:38:22.791 --> 01:38:26.083
Greetings. I'm Muslim.

01:38:26.458 --> 01:38:28.500
I am Jain.

01:38:28.583 --> 01:38:31.000
Hi, I'm Christian.

01:38:31.583 --> 01:38:34.541
Hello! I'm Jagat Janani, a Hindu.

01:38:35.416 --> 01:38:36.833
Bamboozled!

01:38:37.166 --> 01:38:40.833
I swapped their robes.
Got it?

01:38:41.041 --> 01:38:42.916
Faith is connected to fashion.

01:38:43.083 --> 01:38:46.208
Want a demo?
Check the math.

01:38:46.916 --> 01:38:49.583
Beard + mustache + turban = Sikh.

01:38:50.041 --> 01:38:52.708
Minus turban = Hindu.

01:38:52.916 --> 01:38:56.125
Minus mustache = Muslim!

01:38:56.791 --> 01:38:59.791
This difference is made by the fake God.

01:39:00.125 --> 01:39:02.458
If the real God wanted it,
He'd put a label on us.

01:39:02.541 --> 01:39:05.541
Is there a label on your body?
- Mine?

01:39:05.625 --> 01:39:08.750
Don't gape, strip and check!

01:39:09.166 --> 01:39:11.083
Why be coy?

01:39:11.458 --> 01:39:16.416
Everyone strip and show His Holiness.
Is there any label?

01:39:16.833 --> 01:39:20.083
Cut the coyness.
Okay, I'll go first.

01:39:23.166 --> 01:39:24.208
Look.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.875
Is there a label?
Is there?

01:39:32.541 --> 01:39:34.958
Is there a label? Check some more.

01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:38.625
Remove this ruffian.

01:39:38.833 --> 01:39:42.125
Get out!
- Hey! I'm proving a point.

01:39:42.250 --> 01:39:44.458
Start the chants!

01:39:44.541 --> 01:39:47.208
"Praise be to God!
Glory be to God!"

01:39:47.291 --> 01:39:51.208
Why don't you understand?
That's no divine bead.

01:39:58.958 --> 01:40:00.041
Jaggu!

01:40:01.166 --> 01:40:02.625
Stop this farce!

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.083
Papa?

01:40:06.291 --> 01:40:10.416
You were only 40 days old when
His Holiness christened you.

01:40:10.666 --> 01:40:14.416
Remember, he who gives you
a name, can ruin it too.

01:40:15.083 --> 01:40:17.333
Papa, he named me Jagat Janani.

01:40:17.666 --> 01:40:19.125
How can he ruin it further?

01:40:20.958 --> 01:40:22.416
Name your price!

01:40:22.625 --> 01:40:23.458
Papa!

01:40:23.541 --> 01:40:26.416
Trying to scare His Holiness
to extort money, aren't you?

01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:27.333
No.

01:40:27.416 --> 01:40:31.666
You'll burn in Hell!
Fear the wrath of God!

01:40:37.333 --> 01:40:40.000
Thank you, Papa!
Thank you.

01:40:40.791 --> 01:40:44.333
I'd solved only half the puzzle.
You pieced it together.

01:40:44.625 --> 01:40:46.208
Fear is the key.

01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:51.875
The prankster is cashing in on fear.
Get it?

01:40:52.750 --> 01:40:54.916
Not exactly,
but can you explain it to Papa?

01:40:55.041 --> 01:40:59.000
You bet! I can prove it.
Follow me.

01:41:00.041 --> 01:41:02.291
I don't have time for this nonsense.

01:41:02.625 --> 01:41:06.000
If it turns out to be nonsense,
I'll call off the show.

01:41:19.416 --> 01:41:23.791
Exams are on at this college.
The students are scared stiff.

01:41:24.083 --> 01:41:28.125
Now, we'll establish our business:
The Fear Factory.

01:41:30.791 --> 01:41:31.791
Come on.

01:41:40.166 --> 01:41:42.541
Machine installed.

01:41:47.583 --> 01:41:49.416
A little seed capital.

01:41:54.333 --> 01:41:56.958
Now the inauguration.

01:42:07.041 --> 01:42:11.291
Just watch! The capital
shall double in 15 minutes.

01:42:17.833 --> 01:42:19.333
Look there.

01:42:21.250 --> 01:42:23.041
The first customer.

01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:25.958
Tea! Piping hot tea!

01:42:26.083 --> 01:42:29.708
Check the investment of the tea vendor.

01:42:30.041 --> 01:42:33.375
Kettle, tea, sugar, bike, thermos...

01:42:33.583 --> 01:42:37.250
And here, a rock and a red mark.

01:42:37.583 --> 01:42:39.375
Tea! Piping hot tea!

01:42:39.458 --> 01:42:41.791
There, you've got to woo the clients.

01:42:41.958 --> 01:42:44.833
Here you've got to shoo them away.

01:42:44.916 --> 01:42:48.750
Hey, scram.
Give others a chance

01:42:51.833 --> 01:42:54.166
There you bow before the customer.

01:42:54.375 --> 01:42:56.666
Here the customer bows before you.

01:42:59.166 --> 01:43:03.291
If he's in deep trouble,
he'll lie before you!

01:43:04.333 --> 01:43:08.750
The wrong number guy trades in fear.

01:43:09.125 --> 01:43:12.166
He knows,
"Those in dread, to the temple head."

01:43:12.875 --> 01:43:14.833
You too, seem afraid!
Off with these.

01:43:17.166 --> 01:43:19.666
Do not question religion.

01:43:20.250 --> 01:43:22.375
'It's a matter of faith!'

01:43:22.541 --> 01:43:25.000
'If God didn't want us
to raise questions'

01:43:25.416 --> 01:43:29.458
'He wouldn't have given us
the power to reason.'

01:43:29.833 --> 01:43:33.375
'Guardians of religion use violence
when they can't answer us.'

01:43:33.875 --> 01:43:37.458
'They scare us into silence.
But now we won't be silent.'

01:43:38.125 --> 01:43:42.250
'So far one Tipsy raised questions.
Now there will be a thousand.'

01:43:43.208 --> 01:43:45.833
'Friends, pick up your phones.'

01:43:46.125 --> 01:43:49.125
'When you spot a wrong number,'

01:43:49.291 --> 01:43:51.166
'shoot it and send it to us.'

01:43:51.583 --> 01:43:53.500
'We'll put it on TV.'

01:43:54.041 --> 01:43:55.833
'Dump your fear, ask questions.'

01:44:05.833 --> 01:44:07.458
Holy Sir!

01:44:08.125 --> 01:44:09.458
One question.

01:44:09.541 --> 01:44:11.916
If you can conjure gold from thin air

01:44:12.125 --> 01:44:14.916
why don't you end the nation's poverty?

01:44:15.125 --> 01:44:17.083
Answer, please.

01:44:17.833 --> 01:44:18.791
Holy Sir!

01:44:18.875 --> 01:44:24.791
Since you're a walking gold mine,
why do you ask us for donations?

01:44:26.166 --> 01:44:28.500
God is great!

01:44:28.791 --> 01:44:31.000
This is a wrong number.

01:44:31.083 --> 01:44:32.916
Jaggu, come with me.

01:44:37.958 --> 01:44:38.875
Come.

01:44:39.041 --> 01:44:41.125
The wrong number idea
is a national rage.

01:44:41.416 --> 01:44:44.041
What!
- It's spread like wild fire.

01:44:44.166 --> 01:44:45.000
Come, take a look!

01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:53.041
'Guru said that to land a job
I should feed a cow.'

01:44:53.291 --> 01:44:56.833
'Is this cow an employment agent?'

01:44:57.041 --> 01:45:00.750
'Or will it post my resume on Monster.com?
It's a wrong number.'

01:45:00.833 --> 01:45:02.000
Watch this one!

01:45:02.666 --> 01:45:05.416
'He says, convert to Christianity,
or be damned.'

01:45:05.541 --> 01:45:09.166
'If God wanted,
I would've been Christian by birth.'

01:45:09.541 --> 01:45:12.041
'Why convert now?
It's a wrong number.'

01:45:13.375 --> 01:45:15.333
'These girls want to go to school.'

01:45:15.416 --> 01:45:18.583
'A new dictate says,
"Kill them if they do".'

01:45:18.708 --> 01:45:23.500
'Is God so inconsiderate that
He'll deny knowledge to children?'

01:45:23.833 --> 01:45:24.833
'It's a wrong number.'

01:45:26.166 --> 01:45:29.708
'What God has destined for you
will happen.'

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:34.250
'He has a master plan for the universe.'

01:45:34.541 --> 01:45:36.291
'You have to accept it.'

01:45:36.375 --> 01:45:41.166
'Your disciples say,
"To get a male child,'

01:45:41.250 --> 01:45:45.708
buy this book,
and chant the mantras."'

01:45:45.958 --> 01:45:49.583
'So buy a 10 rupee book'

01:45:49.666 --> 01:45:52.458
'and bust God's master plan!'

01:46:01.708 --> 01:46:05.875
Tipsy! Your show's a hit!
Messages are pouring in.

01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:07.916
Here's another.

01:46:12.750 --> 01:46:13.916
What happened?

01:46:14.916 --> 01:46:16.000
It's from Papa.

01:46:16.625 --> 01:46:18.416
He's ashamed that I'm his daughter.

01:46:22.666 --> 01:46:25.250
You know, I was in tenth grade...

01:46:26.291 --> 01:46:29.166
when I wrote my first poem.

01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:31.208
It was for Papa.

01:46:32.708 --> 01:46:38.083
"They say my Mom I resemble.
I say, possible.

01:46:39.083 --> 01:46:42.041
But I'm my Daddy's girl."

01:46:42.416 --> 01:46:44.916
I recited it on the Annual Day.

01:46:45.375 --> 01:46:47.416
All the parents applauded.

01:46:47.791 --> 01:46:51.666
But one whistled with joy.

01:46:53.041 --> 01:46:56.291
The applause ended,
but the whistling continued.

01:46:58.125 --> 01:46:59.708
It was Papa.

01:47:03.666 --> 01:47:05.291
And now this message.

01:47:08.791 --> 01:47:13.958
There's a wrong number
in your Papa's head.

01:47:14.541 --> 01:47:20.208
The day he gets rid of it,
he'll whistle for you again.

01:47:21.125 --> 01:47:22.250
It won't happen.

01:47:22.791 --> 01:47:25.875
Don't be sad. Come with me.
- Where?

01:47:25.958 --> 01:47:29.458
On my planet, when people are sad,
this is what they do.

01:47:30.625 --> 01:47:32.000
What are you doing, Tipsy?

01:47:32.333 --> 01:47:35.041
Recharge the battery!

01:47:35.250 --> 01:47:37.083
What!
- Just copy me.

01:47:37.208 --> 01:47:38.166
Tipsy...

01:47:43.125 --> 01:47:44.833
What are we doing?

01:47:51.375 --> 01:47:52.583
Shut your eyes.

01:47:52.666 --> 01:47:54.125
Then how will I copy you?

01:47:54.208 --> 01:47:56.125
Right.
Keep them open.

01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:33.666
"To steal glances of you all day..."

01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:36.541
"To strain for every word you say..."

01:49:36.875 --> 01:49:40.041
"To put every chore aside"

01:49:40.125 --> 01:49:43.208
"and follow your every stride"

01:49:43.291 --> 01:49:45.875
"That's nothing but a waste of time."

01:49:46.416 --> 01:49:49.208
"Love is a waste of time."

01:49:49.666 --> 01:49:52.208
"Amore is nothing more."

01:49:52.625 --> 01:49:55.666
"Love is a waste of time."

01:49:56.166 --> 01:49:59.333
"But my mind and heart insist"

01:49:59.416 --> 01:50:02.541
"once in this life at least..."

01:50:02.625 --> 01:50:05.291
"I must waste my time."

01:50:05.375 --> 01:50:08.500
"Without reason or rhyme"

01:50:08.583 --> 01:50:11.625
"I want to waste my time"

01:50:11.708 --> 01:50:14.750
"I love this waste of time."

01:50:31.333 --> 01:50:36.083
"A zillion peeps into the mirror..."

01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:42.541
"A million times
I've styled my hair."

01:50:44.166 --> 01:50:49.333
"Countless sets of clothes I've tried."

01:50:50.541 --> 01:50:55.125
"Emptied perfume bottles with flair."

01:50:56.750 --> 01:51:02.583
"Dressing up is all I did...
Did nothing else worthwhile."

01:51:03.416 --> 01:51:06.333
"Now I understand"

01:51:06.416 --> 01:51:09.500
"That love is a waste of time."

01:51:09.583 --> 01:51:12.750
"But my mind and heart insist"

01:51:12.833 --> 01:51:16.083
"once in this life at least..."

01:51:16.166 --> 01:51:18.791
"I must waste my time"

01:51:18.875 --> 01:51:22.041
"Without reason or rhyme"

01:51:22.125 --> 01:51:25.208
"I want to waste my time"

01:51:25.291 --> 01:51:28.958
"I love this waste of time."

01:52:04.166 --> 01:52:08.750
"My world has Topsy-turvy turned."

01:52:10.583 --> 01:52:15.375
"I know not how to tell you."

01:52:16.750 --> 01:52:22.291
"I smile without rhyme or reason."

01:52:23.208 --> 01:52:28.250
"What's happening I have no clue."

01:52:29.625 --> 01:52:35.541
"The mind just wants to soar,
And from roof-tops yell"

01:52:35.958 --> 01:52:42.291
"Now I understand
Love is a waste of time"

01:52:42.375 --> 01:52:45.541
"But my mind and heart insist"

01:52:45.625 --> 01:52:48.708
"once in this life at least..."

01:52:48.791 --> 01:52:51.500
"I must waste my time."

01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:54.416
"Without reason or rhyme"

01:52:54.750 --> 01:52:57.958
"I want to waste my time"

01:52:58.125 --> 01:53:01.750
"I love this waste of time."

01:53:41.083 --> 01:53:44.291
The donation box is getting
more questions than cash.

01:53:44.666 --> 01:53:48.583
Your relics don't sell anymore.

01:53:49.916 --> 01:53:54.041
These are the negative comments
on Facebook and Twitter.

01:53:55.541 --> 01:53:58.833
Just five?
- Those are in support.

01:53:59.375 --> 01:54:01.500
The abuses are in here.

01:54:01.833 --> 01:54:06.541
It's time for action, Sir.
Avoiding the issue can be disastrous.

01:54:12.708 --> 01:54:14.208
'Missing: God.'

01:54:14.791 --> 01:54:16.250
Call, Bajwa.

01:54:16.708 --> 01:54:20.541
Tipsy has asked many questions.
I'll ask him just one.

01:54:24.708 --> 01:54:26.166
His Holiness wants to come on the show.

01:54:26.541 --> 01:54:27.958
To debate with Tipsy.

01:54:28.708 --> 01:54:29.583
Tipsy will rip him!

01:54:31.250 --> 01:54:32.250
Get Tipsy ready.

01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:45.125
'Don't miss, "The Final Question".
Sunday, 6:00 p.m.'

01:54:45.208 --> 01:54:50.083
My pal's become a star!
Hey, look. He's become a star!

01:54:50.166 --> 01:54:54.083
The star was roaming butt-naked.

01:54:54.166 --> 01:54:59.500
I made him a star.
The bloke's on TV

01:54:59.833 --> 01:55:05.958
and here I am, in a shitty shack
of this shanty town,

01:55:06.416 --> 01:55:09.250
guzzling booze with
a jackass like you.

01:55:09.375 --> 01:55:13.125
Star, my foot!

01:55:29.125 --> 01:55:31.625
'Tipsy, it's a call from Bhairon Singh.'

01:55:32.041 --> 01:55:33.166
Bhairon!

01:55:36.375 --> 01:55:38.833
Bro!
- 'You lusty lad.'

01:55:38.916 --> 01:55:40.958
You're a rock star!

01:55:41.833 --> 01:55:43.250
Bro, where are you?

01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:46.750
In Mandawa.
Coming to Delhi tomorrow.

01:55:46.833 --> 01:55:49.583
With a gift for you.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:54.250
'I've nabbed the thief
who stole your stuff.'

01:55:54.666 --> 01:55:57.625
He sold it for 40 grand.

01:55:58.333 --> 01:56:00.500
'Guess to who?'
- Who?

01:56:01.083 --> 01:56:02.625
His Holiness!

01:56:06.541 --> 01:56:07.916
'God said,'

01:56:08.291 --> 01:56:13.791
"It's a divine bead
from Lord Shiva's necklace.

01:56:14.041 --> 01:56:18.041
Take it and enshrine it in a grand temple.

01:56:18.125 --> 01:56:19.708
Sighting this bead..."

01:56:19.791 --> 01:56:21.333
Hey!

01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:24.708
What happened?

01:56:25.208 --> 01:56:28.916
The thief who stole
my remote has been caught.

01:56:30.875 --> 01:56:36.125
Bro said, the thief sold it
to His Holiness.

01:56:36.333 --> 01:56:38.208
Then His Holiness is finished!

01:56:38.833 --> 01:56:45.375
We'll tell him, "Return the remote,
or the thief tells all on TV."

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.791
So he didn't find my
remote in the Himalayas!

01:56:48.875 --> 01:56:51.083
He's lying.

01:56:52.458 --> 01:56:56.708
Wrong numbers are not
floated by some fake God,

01:56:57.125 --> 01:56:58.541
but by His Holiness.

01:57:01.666 --> 01:57:04.041
Did you know about this, Jaggu?

01:57:04.333 --> 01:57:06.791
Do you remember the day you
mentioned wrong numbers to me?

01:57:06.916 --> 01:57:11.916
All his calls are going
to a wrong number.

01:57:12.166 --> 01:57:16.833
'I knew that you were on the
wrong track. But I kept mum.'

01:57:16.916 --> 01:57:20.833
'If you would've called him a fraud,
people would've killed you.'

01:57:21.125 --> 01:57:23.166
'People crave for the unique.'

01:57:23.333 --> 01:57:25.000
'Wrong number!'

01:57:25.250 --> 01:57:28.291
'Your "wrong number" concept was unique.'

01:57:28.375 --> 01:57:31.083
'Today the world supports you.
- This is a wrong number.'

01:57:31.166 --> 01:57:34.458
Tipsy, my plan worked!
You're going home!

01:57:40.375 --> 01:57:43.916
You'll fly away tomorrow, my friend.

01:57:48.458 --> 01:57:51.291
We'll never meet again.

01:57:52.833 --> 01:57:56.041
There will be such a void.

01:58:01.791 --> 01:58:03.875
Should I stay back?

01:58:06.625 --> 01:58:08.500
How can you?

01:58:10.041 --> 01:58:12.916
I'm serious.
I have a job.

01:58:13.875 --> 01:58:16.750
I'll get some ID made
and settle here.

01:58:17.375 --> 01:58:21.708
I'll find someone to
"waste time" with me.

01:58:22.208 --> 01:58:24.750
I'll marry her.

01:58:24.958 --> 01:58:27.916
Who will marry you?
- Why not?

01:58:28.041 --> 01:58:32.541
Your wife will go nuts
introducing you.

01:58:33.125 --> 01:58:36.666
"Meet my husband.
He's Tipsy!"

01:58:37.916 --> 01:58:41.166
That's not my name!
Nonsense!

01:58:41.250 --> 01:58:44.041
Tipsy!
- I'll get a real name.

01:58:45.208 --> 01:58:51.083
Why don't you suggest one?
A name you like.

01:58:51.666 --> 01:58:57.500
A man's name must
match his personality.

01:58:57.625 --> 01:58:59.250
Right!

01:58:59.500 --> 01:59:02.083
So how is my personality?

01:59:02.333 --> 01:59:04.333
Let me give you a demo.

01:59:04.833 --> 01:59:06.958
A poet once wrote...

01:59:09.291 --> 01:59:12.375
'Irony of mismatched names.'

01:59:12.458 --> 01:59:15.791
No poetry, please!
I've something to say.

01:59:16.333 --> 01:59:20.708
'Who says,
"What's in a name?"'

01:59:20.791 --> 01:59:22.000
How do I make her understand?

01:59:22.375 --> 01:59:26.208
'If you don't get the right one
what a pain.'

01:59:27.083 --> 01:59:31.000
'Mr. Burns is in fact so cool.'

01:59:31.333 --> 01:59:34.541
'With violence alone Mr. Peace does rule.'

01:59:35.666 --> 01:59:41.291
'His name is Mr. Fox
but has no bushy tail.'

01:59:42.166 --> 01:59:45.625
'The name is Mr. Green,
but he's always pale.'

01:59:46.875 --> 01:59:51.333
'One whole ton
is the weight of Mr. Flower.'

01:59:51.708 --> 01:59:55.666
'At his mere sight,
the poor chair does cower.'

01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:57.541
Very nice. Very nice.

01:59:57.625 --> 02:00:00.750
Here's a bunch of cards
with different names.

02:00:01.541 --> 02:00:05.125
Pick the one you like.

02:00:05.208 --> 02:00:08.000
Danduram Thatte?

02:00:08.416 --> 02:00:10.916
Disaster!
- Next!

02:00:11.458 --> 02:00:13.166
Tutari Singh?

02:00:16.416 --> 02:00:18.041
Sarfaraz...

02:00:22.375 --> 02:00:25.041
Sarfaraz.
- What happened?

02:00:25.291 --> 02:00:28.083
Keep going,
find a good name.

02:00:31.458 --> 02:00:33.083
What's the matter?

02:00:33.666 --> 02:00:35.291
Nothing.

02:01:43.708 --> 02:01:45.458
Brother!

02:02:18.083 --> 02:02:21.791
"God is in His Heaven,
we mortals on ground."

02:02:22.125 --> 02:02:25.541
"God is in His Heaven,
we mortals on ground."

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.125
"Nowadays He doesn't have
Time to look around."

02:02:30.250 --> 02:02:34.541
"God is in His Heaven,
we mortals on ground."

02:02:42.250 --> 02:02:46.083
"Whatever may happen here
He does not reprimand..."

02:02:46.208 --> 02:02:50.375
"Thousand evils, million wrongs...
He does not take a stand..."

02:02:50.458 --> 02:02:54.125
"Plundering is all around.
Bombs come to hound..."

02:03:42.333 --> 02:03:45.833
'A terrorist outfit has claimed
responsibility for the blast.'

02:03:45.916 --> 02:03:49.333
'They say, "This was a mock drill.

02:03:49.625 --> 02:03:52.541
Persecute our people,
and real war will follow.

02:03:52.625 --> 02:03:55.791
We shall protect our God."'

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.208
Where are you going, Tipsy?

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.250
On the show.

02:04:21.541 --> 02:04:23.625
You don't have to.

02:04:25.875 --> 02:04:28.458
I must, more than ever.

02:04:42.875 --> 02:04:44.291
The Final Question.

02:04:44.833 --> 02:04:48.250
Welcome to our special show

02:04:48.333 --> 02:04:52.000
where we'll meet Tipsy and...
- Wait a minute.

02:04:57.875 --> 02:04:59.875
Bring it.

02:05:05.375 --> 02:05:07.250
What is this?

02:05:07.458 --> 02:05:12.125
God says, it's a divine bead
from His necklace.

02:05:12.375 --> 02:05:16.041
This man claims, it's his property.

02:05:16.791 --> 02:05:20.291
God says, build a temple.

02:05:20.708 --> 02:05:24.083
And this man opposes it.

02:05:24.416 --> 02:05:29.958
Who should I listen to?
God, or this gentleman

02:05:30.208 --> 02:05:36.125
who used to hand out these
blasphemous pamphlets?

02:05:37.458 --> 02:05:40.500
'First he claimed, God is missing.'

02:05:41.166 --> 02:05:43.166
'Then said, God is a fraud.'

02:05:43.416 --> 02:05:47.166
Next he'll say, God is dead.

02:05:48.625 --> 02:05:54.166
What do you want, son?
A world without God?

02:05:56.291 --> 02:06:00.833
Do you have any clue how people suffer?

02:06:01.250 --> 02:06:03.541
People have no food to eat...

02:06:04.083 --> 02:06:06.083
no place to live.

02:06:07.041 --> 02:06:09.791
No friend to talk to.

02:06:10.291 --> 02:06:16.875
People kill themselves.
Slit their wrists, jump off buildings.

02:06:17.458 --> 02:06:21.333
Why? Because they have no hope.

02:06:21.708 --> 02:06:26.291
If bowing before God,
smearing holy ash,

02:06:26.958 --> 02:06:31.708
wearing amulets,
gives them hope to live,

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:36.125
then who are you
to snatch away that hope?

02:06:37.375 --> 02:06:41.833
And if you snatch away their God,

02:06:42.041 --> 02:06:45.541
how will you fill that void?

02:06:46.291 --> 02:06:50.333
This man rants about wrong numbers.

02:06:50.791 --> 02:06:55.375
Today he must tell us,
what is the right number.

02:07:04.416 --> 02:07:06.750
You are right, Your Holiness.

02:07:08.208 --> 02:07:13.791
There was a time
when I too had no food to eat.

02:07:14.500 --> 02:07:16.333
No place to live.

02:07:16.875 --> 02:07:21.958
I used to cry a lot
because I had no friend.

02:07:23.375 --> 02:07:26.625
The only thing I had, was hope.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.916
God.

02:07:31.750 --> 02:07:35.083
Each day I hoped,
tomorrow will be better.

02:07:35.375 --> 02:07:38.208
God will find a solution.

02:07:39.750 --> 02:07:46.708
I agree that believing
in God gives hope...

02:07:47.916 --> 02:07:52.208
the strength to face ordeals.

02:07:53.333 --> 02:07:55.875
But I have one question.

02:07:58.666 --> 02:08:01.625
Which God should I believe in?

02:08:02.583 --> 02:08:05.250
You say there is one God.

02:08:06.875 --> 02:08:08.833
I say no.

02:08:09.833 --> 02:08:11.375
There are two Gods.

02:08:12.875 --> 02:08:15.041
One who created us.

02:08:16.583 --> 02:08:20.375
And the other, whom you created.

02:08:21.583 --> 02:08:24.708
We know nothing about
the God who made us.

02:08:25.166 --> 02:08:29.875
But the God you made up,
is just like you.

02:08:30.250 --> 02:08:34.750
Petty. Takes bribes,
makes false promises.

02:08:34.916 --> 02:08:38.958
Readily meets the rich,
keeps the poor waiting.

02:08:39.250 --> 02:08:42.625
Thrives on flattery.
Makes you live in fear.

02:08:44.625 --> 02:08:46.916
My right number is simple.

02:08:48.333 --> 02:08:53.041
Believe in the God who created us.

02:08:54.708 --> 02:08:58.083
And the God you created...

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.208
should be abolished.

02:09:03.208 --> 02:09:07.416
You'll abolish my God
and I'll keep quiet?

02:09:07.708 --> 02:09:11.791
I know how to protect my God.

02:09:11.875 --> 02:09:13.875
You will protect God?

02:09:14.333 --> 02:09:15.458
You!

02:09:16.708 --> 02:09:18.416
This is a puny planet.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.875
Billions of bigger planets
float in the space.

02:09:22.083 --> 02:09:26.875
And you, sitting in a tiny corner of this
puny planet, have the nerve to say

02:09:27.083 --> 02:09:30.750
that you will protect Him?
The creator of the universe!

02:09:31.833 --> 02:09:36.541
He doesn't need your protection.
He can protect Himself.

02:09:40.083 --> 02:09:45.583
Today someone tried to
protect their God and my friend died.

02:09:46.541 --> 02:09:48.291
This is all that's left, his shoe.

02:09:50.125 --> 02:09:52.291
Stop protecting God.

02:09:52.833 --> 02:09:56.291
Or else this planet will have
no humans, only shoes.

02:09:56.541 --> 02:09:58.958
A Muslim terrorist blows up a train

02:09:59.875 --> 02:10:05.291
and a Hindu guru endures
your sermon. That's nice.

02:10:05.541 --> 02:10:10.458
What's this Hindu, Muslim?
Show me the label.

02:10:11.708 --> 02:10:14.416
You created these differences, not God.

02:10:15.083 --> 02:10:21.041
This is the deadliest
wrong number of this planet.

02:10:21.333 --> 02:10:24.000
It kills people, separates them.

02:10:24.458 --> 02:10:29.375
Like your wrong number
separated Jaggu from Sarfaraz.

02:10:29.458 --> 02:10:35.500
What wrong number?
- That Sarfaraz would betray her.

02:10:35.833 --> 02:10:38.375
And he did betray her.

02:10:38.458 --> 02:10:42.958
Hold on. What's going on?
- Hold it.

02:10:44.875 --> 02:10:52.125
Are you telling me that my prophecy
about Sarfaraz was wrong?

02:10:52.208 --> 02:10:53.458
Exactly!

02:10:53.541 --> 02:10:57.708
Then prove it.
Prove my prophecy wrong!

02:10:57.791 --> 02:11:02.416
And if you fail,
you'll have to fall at my feet and admit

02:11:02.541 --> 02:11:06.583
that you are a liar.
And that you tried to defame me.

02:11:07.208 --> 02:11:09.416
What if I prove it?

02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:10.791
No, Tipsy!

02:11:17.333 --> 02:11:19.000
Then this shall be yours.

02:11:24.958 --> 02:11:26.583
I accept.

02:11:27.083 --> 02:11:31.791
Turn the cameras towards
Jagat Janani.

02:11:37.916 --> 02:11:44.583
I hope you will answer
my questions truthfully.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:52.083
In Belgium you fell in love
with a Pakistani boy.

02:11:53.541 --> 02:11:54.875
True or false?

02:11:55.250 --> 02:11:57.416
Please spare my personal life.

02:11:57.583 --> 02:12:01.916
On Friday, at 3:21 p.m.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:06.250
I predicted that this
boy will betray you.

02:12:06.583 --> 02:12:10.958
The next day you went to the
Marriage Registrar's office

02:12:11.375 --> 02:12:13.250
'but he didn't show up.'

02:12:13.708 --> 02:12:17.083
True or false?
- Yes, he didn't come.

02:12:17.166 --> 02:12:18.833
Can you please stop this?

02:12:20.916 --> 02:12:27.250
Now will you come to my feet
or should I walk up to you?

02:12:27.333 --> 02:12:31.416
Sarfaraz did not betray.
- Please let it go!

02:12:31.500 --> 02:12:33.791
No. Tell us what happened that day.

02:12:34.166 --> 02:12:35.791
Tipsy, please!

02:12:35.875 --> 02:12:39.166
Just once, for my sake.

02:12:44.333 --> 02:12:47.500
I was at the
Marriage Registrar's office and...

02:12:48.875 --> 02:12:51.291
I received a letter.
- Did Sarfaraz bring it?

02:12:53.875 --> 02:12:58.083
No. He sent it through a kid.

02:12:58.166 --> 02:13:01.250
Was it signed?
- No!

02:13:01.333 --> 02:13:04.291
Then how do you know
that Sarfaraz sent it?

02:13:08.250 --> 02:13:11.083
It could have been for some other girl.

02:13:15.208 --> 02:13:19.625
There was another girl.
With a cat, right?

02:13:21.541 --> 02:13:25.791
She asked you to hold the
cat for a while, right?

02:13:26.625 --> 02:13:29.666
The kid who gave you the letter,
did he know you?

02:13:30.500 --> 02:13:33.041
No.
- Did you know him?

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:34.833
No.

02:13:34.916 --> 02:13:38.500
Then how would he know
that the letter was for you?

02:13:39.875 --> 02:13:46.500
Maybe he was told to give
the letter to the girl with the cat.

02:13:48.541 --> 02:13:54.291
You read the letter,
but didn't call Sarfaraz.

02:13:55.750 --> 02:13:57.958
Did you?

02:13:58.708 --> 02:14:02.750
Because this man planted
a wrong number in your head

02:14:03.166 --> 02:14:05.916
that Muslims betray.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.375
Sarfaraz didn't betray you, Jaggu.

02:14:08.458 --> 02:14:09.791
What's going on?

02:14:10.291 --> 02:14:15.208
You expect us to believe
these cat and bull stories?

02:14:15.333 --> 02:14:16.666
One minute.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:21.000
We'll get to the truth right now.
Jaggu, call Sarfaraz.

02:14:25.625 --> 02:14:28.833
'This number does not exist.'

02:14:29.875 --> 02:14:30.958
Any other number?

02:14:31.125 --> 02:14:33.291
Friend, college, something...

02:14:33.583 --> 02:14:34.875
Come on, Jaggu!

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:36.458
Belgium University.
- Dial.

02:14:41.125 --> 02:14:42.791
Hello.
- Hello...

02:14:43.708 --> 02:14:46.875
I actually need to get in touch
with one of your grad students.

02:14:47.583 --> 02:14:48.875
Sarfaraz Yousuf.

02:14:48.958 --> 02:14:51.208
Oh, yeah, he left for Pakistan
last year.

02:14:51.250 --> 02:14:52.500
Contact?

02:14:52.583 --> 02:14:53.625
Has he left a number?

02:14:53.708 --> 02:14:56.541
I'm sorry, we're not authorized
to give out information.

02:14:56.750 --> 02:14:58.291
Ma'am, this is really important.

02:14:58.375 --> 02:13:59.083
'Email us your request, so I can
forward it to student affairs.'

02:13:59.166 --> 02:14:00.583
Have a nice day, dear.

02:15:03.166 --> 02:15:05.625
What about his home phone number?
- I don't know.

02:15:05.708 --> 02:15:08.208
Think, Jaggu darling, think...

02:15:09.166 --> 02:15:11.666
'I work at the Pakistan Embassy.'

02:15:12.166 --> 02:15:14.375
He used to work at the Pakistan Embassy.

02:15:15.458 --> 02:15:17.791
Mitu, call the Pakistan Embassy, Belgium.

02:15:17.875 --> 02:15:19.583
Copy, sir.
- 'Put it on the speakers.'

02:15:23.541 --> 02:15:25.416
Greetings.
Pakistan Embassy.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:26.958
Hello...

02:15:29.125 --> 02:15:32.458
A student from Lahore worked with you.

02:15:32.583 --> 02:15:33.708
Sarfaraz Yousuf.

02:15:33.833 --> 02:15:35.333
Is your name Jaggu?

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.500
Hello. Is your name Jaggu?

02:15:41.916 --> 02:15:43.625
Yes. How do you know?

02:15:43.916 --> 02:15:45.250
She called!

02:15:45.375 --> 02:15:47.666
The girl from Delhi has called!

02:15:47.791 --> 02:15:49.500
Farah, it's Jaggu calling!

02:15:49.583 --> 02:15:53.416
Mr. Sayyed, hurry up.
It's Jaggu's call from India.

02:15:53.500 --> 02:15:55.750
Come on, hurry up!
Everyone!

02:15:58.791 --> 02:16:04.625
Sarfaraz Yousuf calls us from Lahore,
every day at 9:00 a.m.

02:16:05.416 --> 02:16:09.541
and with impeccable politeness,
asks just one question.

02:16:09.833 --> 02:16:13.958
"Did Jaggu call from India?"

02:16:14.875 --> 02:16:18.000
We say "no," and he disconnects.

02:16:18.250 --> 02:16:20.125
He's driven us crazy.

02:16:20.375 --> 02:16:22.750
Wait. Let me connect you.

02:16:38.083 --> 02:16:39.416
'Hello?'

02:16:40.333 --> 02:16:43.583
Mr. Sarfaraz Yousuf?
- 'Yes, speaking.'

02:16:43.958 --> 02:16:47.833
Where are you?
- 'In Lahore. Why?'

02:16:48.208 --> 02:16:53.208
Where are you right now?
- 'At home. Why?'

02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:57.500
Is there a chair or a bench nearby?

02:16:57.833 --> 02:17:02.083
Please sit down.
You're about to get a jolt.

02:17:03.375 --> 02:17:05.375
'Pardon me?'

02:17:06.916 --> 02:17:08.458
You have a call from Delhi.

02:17:15.541 --> 02:17:17.458
Here, talk to her.

02:17:20.041 --> 02:17:21.125
Hello?

02:17:21.375 --> 02:17:23.250
Sarfaraz.

02:17:27.458 --> 02:17:29.125
Jaggu.

02:17:33.791 --> 02:17:35.916
Hello, Jaggu, what's the matter?

02:17:38.833 --> 02:17:41.083
Did you go to the
Marriage Registrar's office?

02:17:41.208 --> 02:17:45.041
I did, but you had left.

02:17:45.708 --> 02:17:47.750
Why didn't you call?

02:17:48.041 --> 02:17:50.250
How could I?
I got your letter.

02:17:50.708 --> 02:17:53.333
'You had said, "don't contact me."'

02:17:54.208 --> 02:17:56.750
I knew you were under family pressure.

02:17:56.833 --> 02:18:03.333
But deep down I knew,
one day you would contact me.

02:18:05.666 --> 02:18:08.000
What took you so long?

02:18:09.833 --> 02:18:14.291
I am sorry.
I had your wrong number.

02:18:21.666 --> 02:18:24.166
I just got the right
number from a friend.

02:18:51.666 --> 02:18:53.041
Thank you, son.

02:19:28.083 --> 02:19:29.916
Here, hold this.

02:19:54.208 --> 02:19:57.250
Tipsy! You're taking batteries home?

02:19:57.916 --> 02:20:02.416
Don't get them there.
- But why do you need so many batteries?

02:20:02.708 --> 02:20:06.625
Back home, I'll listen
to the sounds I've recorded.

02:20:06.958 --> 02:20:08.291
What sounds?

02:20:08.583 --> 02:20:12.958
The sounds of earth.
Of the crows, the traffic, the honking.

02:20:13.166 --> 02:20:15.541
Up there, you'll listen to cars honking?

02:20:15.833 --> 02:20:20.375
Now and then...
whenever I miss this planet.

02:20:22.916 --> 02:20:26.500
Hey, wait!
There's one more bag.

02:20:26.583 --> 02:20:28.125
Forget it, Tipsy!

02:20:28.208 --> 02:20:31.666
You kidding?
It's stuffed with batteries.

02:20:32.125 --> 02:20:33.875
Wait!

02:20:37.583 --> 02:20:41.000
Driver, please stop!

02:20:54.625 --> 02:20:58.375
'Does everyone on your planet
have stick-out ears?'

02:20:59.625 --> 02:21:02.791
'And everyone roams around naked?'

02:21:04.250 --> 02:21:06.791
'Why are you staring?
Is there something on my face?'

02:21:11.375 --> 02:21:13.958
'You know, I was in tenth grade...'

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:16.750
'when I wrote my first poem.'

02:21:18.416 --> 02:21:20.416
'It was for Papa.'

02:21:21.375 --> 02:21:26.875
'"They say my Mom I resemble.
I say, possible."'

02:21:34.166 --> 02:21:38.125
'Poetry means
sparse words, soaring thoughts.'

02:21:40.500 --> 02:21:42.583
'Pal, you're really cute.'

02:21:44.291 --> 02:21:47.791
'Here's to the teetotaler called Tipsy.'

02:21:48.666 --> 02:21:52.583
'Granted, I am poor...'

02:21:53.583 --> 02:21:57.750
'No tape had the sounds of
the crows or the traffic.'

02:21:58.416 --> 02:22:00.916
'Every tape had just my voice.'

02:22:11.791 --> 02:22:12.833
'Mandawa'

02:22:15.750 --> 02:22:17.500
Got it!

02:22:22.541 --> 02:22:25.083
He sure made me run!

02:22:28.333 --> 02:22:31.625
Tipsy, what's in these tapes?

02:22:32.875 --> 02:22:35.375
I told you.
The crows, the traffic.

02:22:47.625 --> 02:22:52.083
Every night, when your planet
rises, I'll play these tapes.

02:22:53.458 --> 02:22:58.708
And wave at you.
Like this.

02:23:01.208 --> 02:23:04.750
Will you wave back,
now and then?

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.416
Haven't you recorded my voice?

02:23:10.458 --> 02:23:12.958
Your voice?

02:23:13.291 --> 02:23:17.500
I think I have.
That one poem you recited.

02:23:18.625 --> 02:23:21.333
One poem? That's all?

02:23:24.458 --> 02:23:26.999
I'm not exactly in love with you,

02:23:27.250 --> 02:23:28.833
to waste all my time over you!

02:23:49.208 --> 02:23:52.083
'He didn't look back.
Not once.'

02:23:52.750 --> 02:23:54.583
'Perhaps, he was hiding his tears.'

02:23:55.916 --> 02:23:59.833
'One thing he learnt from us.
One thing he taught us.'

02:24:01.250 --> 02:24:03.833
'He learnt how to lie...'

02:24:04.166 --> 02:24:07.958
'and taught us how to love.'

02:24:09.208 --> 02:24:12.125
'He loved me enough,
to let me go.'

02:24:12.916 --> 02:24:18.291
He came here naked,
as children do.

02:24:19.458 --> 02:24:25.249
Asked a lot of questions,
as children do.

02:24:27.416 --> 02:24:30.541
And then one day...

02:24:31.958 --> 02:24:33.749
he went away.

02:24:35.833 --> 02:24:39.000
Four billion miles away.

02:24:41.666 --> 02:24:44.458
He left me two parting gifts.

02:24:47.666 --> 02:24:49.958
Sarfaraz...

02:24:50.750 --> 02:24:52.125
and Papa.

02:24:55.916 --> 02:24:57.374
Till the time I am alive,

02:24:58.083 --> 02:25:02.583
I'll look at his planet every night
and wave.

02:25:05.083 --> 02:25:08.541
I'm sure, he'll do the same.

02:25:12.791 --> 02:25:14.666
I miss him.

02:25:54.500 --> 02:25:58.791
'Fellow astronauts,
prepare to land on Earth.'

02:25:58.916 --> 02:26:02.999
'Remember the four
Earth Survival Commandments.'

02:26:03.125 --> 02:26:06.124
'One, do not roam around naked.'

02:26:06.208 --> 02:26:11.708
'Cuddling, making love, etcetera,
must be done in closed rooms.'

02:26:11.916 --> 02:26:15.958
'But fighting and making war
is allowed in the open.'

02:26:16.250 --> 02:26:20.000
'Two, beware of the language,
it's confusing.'

02:26:20.083 --> 02:26:23.791
'If Earthlings say,
"I love chicken and fish."

02:26:23.875 --> 02:26:27.583
'It doesn't mean that they love animals,'

02:26:27.666 --> 02:26:32.208
'but that those animals are
on the lunch menu.'

02:26:32.458 --> 02:26:37.458
'The gap between the thought and
the speech is our topic of research.'

02:26:37.833 --> 02:26:41.500
'Three, on landing,
find dancing cars for clothes.'

02:26:41.583 --> 02:26:44.708
'Hide your remotes
deep in your underwear,'

02:26:44.875 --> 02:26:48.958
'safe from thieves.'

02:26:49.041 --> 02:26:52.291
'And four, the mother commandment.'

02:26:52.375 --> 02:26:56.708
'If anyone says,
"I'll connect you to God."

02:26:56.791 --> 02:27:01.208
'Dump the research, take a U-turn
and run for your life.'

02:27:13.875 --> 02:27:16.375
Come, don't be afraid.

02:27:21.875 --> 02:27:23.791
What are you goggling at?

02:27:25.458 --> 02:27:28.083
I have a question.
- What?

02:27:29.125 --> 02:27:33.250
On your last visit,
how often were you whacked?

02:27:41.750 --> 02:27:44.208
What's this?
- Self-defense!

02:27:45.083 --> 02:27:47.166
Oh, I see.
Safety gadgets?

02:27:47.333 --> 02:27:50.625
Let's go.
- Not there! This way.

02:27:50.708 --> 02:27:52.000
Kaput!
