1
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:09,326
It is said that there
comes a day in everyone's life..

2
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,797
..which changes his life forever.

3
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:16,135
People have their day I had my night.

4
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:17,705
The night of 2nd October.

5
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,068
The night of the
birth anniversary of Gandhi.

6
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,507
I didn't know that
fate, love, money and Delhi..

7
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:30,017
..will take me to task on this
one night and change my life forever.

8
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:36,188
I still wonder what if I
had not caught the last metro.

9
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:42,029
Yes friend Situ where are you?

10
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:47,032
Oh no friend! I didn't get any girl.

11
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,267
Everything was just fruitless.

12
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,110
Not anyone's. What sort of?

13
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,471
I said it was just
fruitless. Fruitless. You dirty mind.

14
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,138
Bring yourself out from dirty thoughts.

15
00:01:55,682 --> 00:02:00,244
Hey listen, please come
back and pick me up from metro.

16
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,088
Aren't you my brother? You..

17
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,689
Oh my!

18
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,394
Okay listen, listen
brother, there's a change in plan.

19
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,026
A gorgeous girl is
standing right in front.

20
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,294
Now I want to take the metro.

21
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,397
Listen, Mohan's house is empty right?

22
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,270
Okay, okay, bye.

23
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,649
Hello there.

24
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,415
Commuters please pay attention.

25
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,457
This is the last metro of 11:40 from..

26
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,052
..Kendriya
Sachivalay to Badarpur border.

27
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,235
It is empty.

28
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,207
Its night, that's why.

29
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,349
Go if you wish.

30
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,660

Look here. Oh no!

00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,711
Excuse me.

34
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:47,020
Sorry, but are you going to Mulchand?

35
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,052
No, but you want I will go there.

36
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,492
Do you want to go to Mulchand?

37
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:54,625
Thank you so much.

38
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,132
I have a small work.

39
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,136
Yes, yes say.

Husband? - Yes.

43
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,205
Wearing black pant

44
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,473
Please give him this letter.

45
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,147
I would've gone there
myself but I have some urgent work.

46
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,279
Doesn't matter.

47
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,062
Doesn't matter.

48
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,722

It's open.

52
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,475
Don't worry Ms. Anamika.

53
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:52,324
She came in hands your but
you couldn't enjoy her, Lucky.

54
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,235
What's there in this letter?

55
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:10,102
If I don't do what I have been
told not to do then what's the fun?

56
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,108
The one who has this letter in
his hands is responsible for my death.

57
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,444
I can never forgive him for my death.

58
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,315
Anamika.

59
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,687
What has happened? -
Something has happened.

60
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,062
Let's go and see. - Yes, come.

61

Come.

62
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,100
What has happened?

63
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,363
What has happened?

64
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,104
Let's see.

65
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,037
Looks like an accident.

66
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,278
Poor woman!

67
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,113
She had just come inside the train.

68
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,267
Move aside police has come.

69
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,337
The one who has this letter in
his hands is responsible for my death.

70
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,368
The one who has this letter in
his hands is responsible for my death.

71
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,750
Hey you enemy of Delhi.

72
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,375
What's this?

73
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,284
This is metro station and
not your house or a dustbin.

74
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:30,989
Sorry brother.

75
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,217
How does your sorry help?

76
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,016
You'll pee and spit
wherever you like, right?

77
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,221
You litter anywhere you like.

78
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,122
I won't allow this
to happen in this country.

79
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,030
This is my promise.
- Sorry, give it to me.

80
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:43,700
Now pick it up.

81
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,651
There is a saying that
when you run out of luck then..

82
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,526
..even a man seated on top
of a camel gets bitten by a dog.

83
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,389
But I had never imagined that..

84
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,330
..the dog of fate
will bite me in this manner.

85
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,229
Why are you playing
with this piece of paper?

86
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,395
No, I was not playing with it.

87
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,203
It was lying down so..

88
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,538
What's there in this love letter?

89
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,144
It's not mine, sir.

90
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,475
I don't know.

91
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,441
People litter anywhere.

92
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,539
Come on give me I'll
throw it in the dustbin.

93
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,709
Hey Liar! No sir.

94
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,719
Sir, he is lying.

95
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,051
This must be the
letter that the woman gave him.

96
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,350
I had seen it, sir.

97
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,415
Why are you leading me to trouble?

98
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,983
It's nonsense, sir.

99
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,218
Which woman?

100
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,319
I don't know any woman, sir.

101
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,227
I, I am a virgin.

102
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,030
He is a virgin.

103
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,251
My name is Bhusan Dhondiyal.

104
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,352
I can even find out a
melting needle inside fire.

105
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,956
Come on put your hand inside his mouth.

106
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,689
Okay sir. Just a minute, sir.

107
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,764
Read what's written
in the letter. - Okay.

108
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,037
Read.

109
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,238
Sir, he is the murderer. - No, sir.

110
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,507
Hey all of you come here.

111
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,743
Come here. Yadav, Kasana,
all of you come. Come quickly.

112
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,775
I have done nothing
and now I'm in trouble.

113
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,520
Do something Lucky, do something.

114
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,180
Run, Lucky, run.

115
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,121
Yes, run.

116
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,352
Yes, run, run Lucky.

117
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,188
Sir. Sir.

118
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,354
Sir, he is running away.

119
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,389
Sir. - Hey wait! Catch him!

120
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,062
Situ as right.

121
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,072
Every dog has his day.

122
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,572
He dies the death of a dog.

123
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,278
In five minutes my
life was completely changed.

124
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:22,220
I still feel that I
shouldn't have caught the last metro.

125
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,520
Everything was fine just an hour back.

126
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:46,312
Ladies and gentlemen, this
night is an exceptional night..

127
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:51,051
..for all of us who believe
that the gays have the same rights..

128
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,217
..to live in this
country as the straights.

129
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:58,188
And to support this noble
cause Rohit Pichwadia has launched..

130
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:04,135
..his bold and
courageous line Engaged 377.

131
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,635
This is my fashion line..

132
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:10,130
..to celebrate the
Article 377 of the Indian law..

133
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,076
..which gives gays their rights.

134
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:15,341
But before you ask me anything
let me tell you I'm not gay, okay.

135
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,465
Zoom it a bit. Zoom it a bit.

136
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,135
Oh great!

137
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,063
It looks like a great ass.

138
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,574
I'll make an MMS and send to everyone.

139
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,609
We'll tell the straight that it's
Rakhi's and we'll tell the gays it's Imran's.

140
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,139
You talk dirty things so nicely, friend.

141
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:52,813
You useless fellows, your
Popli father is calling you.

142
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,843
He wants to make xxxwith you both.

143
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,148
Do you know why people call me Popli?

144
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:03,226
Because your surname is Popli.

145
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:12,035
Because our brother can
get into anyone and destroy him.

146
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,635
Who is this fellow with you?

147
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,371
Sir, sir myself Lokesh, Lokesh Duggal.

148
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,469

149
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,012
Sir you had told me to
appoint a guy to help me out.

150
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,646
Sir he is the one

Okay go, take his help

But sir, there are
arrangements of alcohol outside.

00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,285
Absolutely sir. -
It's flowing like water sir.

154
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,829
Stupid fellow I have given
bribe of one lakh to get this deal.

155
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:42,166
Go and serve them pee.

156
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,596
If I do not get liquor here..

157
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,695
..then I'll declare
everywhere how you were raped.

158
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,138
Brother, this is good poetry.

159
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,365

00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,683
Go get one more. - Okay. - More? - Yes.

180
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,020
Let me try. Sir. Let's do it, sir.

181
00:13:19,831 --> 00:13:23,267
Hey wait, give it to
the Arabic man over there.

182
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:25,663
Shoot it, shoot it.

183
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,004
Dubai, I love it.

184
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:35,842
Drink my pee, pee.

185
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:37,913
Look, look.

186
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:40,146
The white will also drink the local one.

187
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:43,014
Oh no! The minister.

188
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:44,817
Is he from the bottle department?

189
00:13:44,856 --> 00:13:46,153
I don't know the department he is from.

190
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:48,591
Seems he doesn't like it. - Oh no!

191
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:53,025
Your drink.

192
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:54,697
Look at that my friend.

193
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:55,859
Take a close up, close up.

194
00:13:58,303 --> 00:14:00,737
She is the model from Kingfisher.

195
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,272
She is also drinking yours.

196
00:14:05,977 --> 00:14:07,308
Sorry. Sorry.

197
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,807
Doesn't matter, you are welcome.

198
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:11,175
It's okay.

199
00:14:14,352 --> 00:14:16,320
Brother, she has
intentionally pushed you.

200
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:17,849
She is giving you hints.

201
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,153
What are you saying? Really?

202
00:14:20,558 --> 00:14:22,549
She is wonderful.

203
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:25,162
Just think of it. Why did she push you?

204
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:28,222
She could have pushed him or me or him.

205
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:30,334
But she has come and picked you.

206
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:35,171
And the one who smiles
will definitely give kiss.

207
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:38,767
Take this.

208
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,236
You'll look like a
gentleman. Come on, go.

209
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:46,040
Yes madam, excuse me, drink.

210
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:48,108
Madam, not this, this one.

211
00:14:49,854 --> 00:14:52,948
I'm sorry I don't drink. - Oh!

212
00:14:57,228 --> 00:14:58,627
This is mine.

213
00:14:58,863 --> 00:15:00,160
Come on go.

214
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:06,865
You do it really well.

215
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:09,903
Excuse me.

216
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:12,101
You don't drink.

217
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:14,144
That's very good of you.

218
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:19,577
Oh no! I'll die.

219
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,282
You okay, nah sir?

221
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:57,182
He-man.

223
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,557
Thank you so much,
sir. Thank you so much.

224
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,289
Oh my god!

225
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:05,626
Sir, I'll be back.

226
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:07,688
Are you all right Rohit? - I'm fine.

227
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:12,127
Hello there.

228
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,802

229
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:17,968

His ass is so cute, nah?

231
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,008
Better than any model here.

232
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:25,676
I remember boys by
their ass and not their faces.

233
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:27,241
You ass-eater.

234
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:29,082
You dog.. - Bow wow!

00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:35,553
Okay.

238
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:36,853
Oh no!

239
00:16:47,872 --> 00:16:50,170
Don't worry Guggu. I'm there.

240
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:06,513
Tinku close the
window, I'll put on the ac.

00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:07,953
I'll do it.

Hello sir.

243
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,601
Hello sir.

244
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:23,272
Sir, many of your
scams are being revealed?

245
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,172
What do you have to say about it?

246
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,233
What will be the plan of
your party under such circumstances?

247
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:27,073
Look, with time
you'll get to know everything.

248
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,808
Swami Shivanand has started
fasting against you regarding corruption.

249
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:30,815
What do you have to say on this?

250
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,544
Look, I do not want
to say anything on it.

251
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,778
Sir, sir.. -
Please, I'm in an emergency.

252
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:34,944
Please, please.

253
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:39,684
Hey Mandy, come quickly.

254
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:43,059
Mr. Pichwadia has asked
for a drink for the minister.

255
00:17:43,094 --> 00:17:44,152
For the minister.

256
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,630
The people of the press..

257
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:49,360

00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,567
We are having a blast here.

00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:04,073
Today is the launch of
my fashion line Engaged 377.

264
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:05,139

Hey come on, come on.

Oh no!

What are you doing?

270
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,089
Quietly, quietly.

271
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:19,096
Do it, do it.

272
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,188
Only for us.

273
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:22,096
Please sir only for us. Please.

274
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:23,226
He is drinking, he is drinking.

275
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,530
The minister is drinking.

276
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:32,207
Now he won't get
involved in any corruption.

277
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:34,208
We have done urine treatment on him.

278
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:37,210
Okay bye, bye. - Bye sir. - Bye sir.

279
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,213
The party has just begun Lavina.

280
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,018
Where are you going?

281
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:49,259
Sir, I'll have to
catch the last metro at 11:40.

282
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,629
Anyways the show is over now.

283
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:53,922
And if I miss the
train then I'll get stuck.

284
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:54,999
Okay fine.

285
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:56,862
Wait for ten more minutes.

286
00:18:57,235 --> 00:18:58,668
Okay sir, thank you.

287
00:18:58,703 --> 00:18:59,897
Thank you. - Bye.

288
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,905
The last metro at 11:40.

289
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,974
Brother, this is a
very good opportunity.

290
00:19:10,014 --> 00:19:12,073
Catch her at metro and hug
her at Mohan's place in Munirka.

291
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,742
Mohan's room in Munirka is empty.

292
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:14,911
The keys are there.

293
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,181
Blanket and everything else is there.

294
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:20,590
Run the metro on the bed. Non -stop.

295
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:24,088
Hi handsome!

296
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:44,982
My eyes have
recognized the super model in you.

297
00:19:45,783 --> 00:19:49,048
Hey do you want to come
to our Chattepur farmhouse..

298
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,351
..for a party
tonight? - No, no sir it's fine.

299
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:55,025
No, sir I'll call you.

300
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:57,027
Call without fail. Okay? - Sure, sure.

301
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:04,191
What are you doing?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

302
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:05,224
Are you okay? -
Does anyone do such things?

303
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,737
Can't you see? Are you blind?

304
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:09,336
Hey stop! Stop!

305
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,341
Catch him!

306
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,603
Stop!

307
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:15,269
Strange.

308
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,177
Come, come. Don't you
want to catch the metro?

309
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:18,113
Yes, come, come.

310
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:20,245
What?

311
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,776
Who is going to serve
drinks to your fathers inside?

312
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,285
Your Popli delayed us.

313
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:28,588
Wear your helmet and hurry up.

314
00:20:29,193 --> 00:20:30,353
I have to catch the last metro.

315
00:20:30,795 --> 00:20:31,853
The girl shouldn't go away.

316
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:33,396
Has she gone there?

317
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:36,256
Many things happen at such big parties.

318
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,159
Maybe some rich brat
has taken her in a suite.

319
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,100
Your sister-in-law is not like this.

320
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:45,301
Dirty mind.

321
00:20:45,943 --> 00:20:47,103
Brother, this is Delhi, this is Delhi.

322
00:20:47,211 --> 00:20:50,271
When rich dirty
people come out at night..

323
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,078
..then the beautiful girls vanish.

324
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:22,944
What's going on?

325
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,175
Is this hurting
him or is he enjoying it?

326
00:21:40,898 --> 00:21:42,627
You are enjoying it
now, right Mr. Pandit?

327
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:48,238
Yes, I'm enjoying it.

328
00:21:48,806 --> 00:21:49,966
Keep doing it.

329
00:21:57,682 --> 00:21:59,843
I'm asking you the last
time Devraj Pandit what will..

330
00:22:00,718 --> 00:22:02,777
..you take for talking about the tape?

331
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:11,194
I'll deal him with a heavy hand.

332
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,566
You'll trap me? - Yes.

333
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,164
You'll trap me?

334
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,207
Sir, sir, you please come here.

335
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,642
Sir, please sir.

336
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,971
Sir, come here.

337
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:30,275
Sir, come here, see this, please.

338
00:22:35,653 --> 00:22:36,642
Who is this fellow?

339
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:37,810
Who is he?

340
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:38,886
I don't know.

341
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:39,947
I haven't seen him before.

342
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,850
He'll be from his NGO.

343
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:47,062
Adarsh, Bharat Yuva
Dal ask this scoundrel?

344
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,656
To whom have you sent him with the tape?

345
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,698
The opposition or the media?

346
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:53,168
Who is this guy?

347
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:54,728
He is the father of all of you.

348
00:22:55,807 --> 00:23:00,904
You all keep playing the
question game with me here.

349
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:05,311
There he must have reached the
place where he is supposed to go.

350
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,245
Congratulations Mr. Acharya.

351
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,914
Tomorrow morning
will be your nuptial night.

352
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:14,921
To whom has he gone to give the tape?

353
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:16,058
To which party does he belong to?

354
00:23:16,093 --> 00:23:20,792
We've the desire to become a martyr.

355
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:25,765
I've to see how strong your arms are.

356
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:31,298
I've to see how strong your
arms are. - Shut up else I'll shoot.

357
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:37,143
What have you done
Sisodiya? He shouldn't have died.

358
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,046
He was our way to the tape.

359
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,745
I didn't try to;, I just
moved it and it triggered off.

360
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,048
Querishi don't stand here.

361
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:45,586
Put him in a box
and throw him in Yamuna.

362
00:23:45,723 --> 00:23:46,712
Come on, quickly.

363
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:49,252
Rawat, show me the entire thing.

364
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:53,162
Querishi take him to that room.

365
00:23:53,197 --> 00:23:54,664
There is an axe there.

366
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:58,858
And listen; cut him into
pieces eight inches long. - Okay.

367
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:02,662
Sir, he is working as
the cameraman's assistant.

368
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:04,299
Rewind it.

369
00:24:05,543 --> 00:24:09,138
Listen, take his snap and send
it to check posts, railway stations..

370
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,169
..and bus depots.

371
00:24:10,214 --> 00:24:11,647
ACP have you gone crazy?

372
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:13,841
Will you send his photo to the
entire police department and declare..

373
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,250
..what the boy has with him.

374
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,011
Appoint your close people in this job.

375
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:20,056
Your close people.
Understood? - Yes sir.

376
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,989
Sir, sir I am
tensed about only one thing.

377
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:25,154
If he gets caught but
doesn't say anything till morning..

378
00:24:25,196 --> 00:24:28,723
..then your nuptial
night will surely take place.

379
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:31,093
Get some ideas.

380
00:24:32,036 --> 00:24:33,128
Use your brains.

381
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,934
Try to do something to
justify your salary. - Yes sir.

382
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,373
If I'm punished tomorrow
then you'll be hunted down.

383
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:40,373
Sir, sir.

384
00:24:40,578 --> 00:24:41,772
Go and find out about the boy.

385
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:45,307
Go! Go! - Yes, yes sir.

386
00:24:46,617 --> 00:24:47,811
Oh no!

387
00:24:48,953 --> 00:24:50,113
These potholes!

388
00:24:50,788 --> 00:24:52,278
The illicit children of the ministers.

389
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:54,818
What problem do you
have with these potholes?

390
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:56,751
Houses are being
made with these potholes.

391
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,997
From the contractor to JE to AE
to the corporators and finally the CM.

392
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:02,529
And honesty is not the trend now.

393
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,658
Dishonesty is hot, super hit.

394
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:08,266
If I had these things
in my hands then I would've..

395
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,831
..taught these
corrupt officials a good lesson.

396
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:14,170
I don't know how people get easily sold.

397
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:17,679
Look, every person has a
price for his prestige. Everyone.

398
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:19,076
You and I will also have some price.

399
00:25:19,116 --> 00:25:20,174
I don't have one.

400
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:21,548
Really? - Yes.

401
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,847
Assume.. - Yes. -..that
you meet a rich Arabic Seikh.

402
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:30,357
He tells you, "Will
you spend the night with me?

403
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:34,187
I'll give you as much
money you want. As much.""

404
00:25:35,032 --> 00:25:36,693
Tell me how much
will you ask for? Tell me.

405
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:37,790
Come on.

406
00:25:37,868 --> 00:25:39,927
I'm an untouched man.

407
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:40,869
Oh!

408
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:43,129
My prestige is not to be sold.

409
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:46,665
The person fixing the
price should be genuine otherwise..

410
00:25:46,777 --> 00:25:49,905
..people open their shops in any way.

411
00:25:50,247 --> 00:25:51,214
Understood?

412
00:25:51,248 --> 00:25:52,374
Just quote the price of your shop.

413
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:53,880
I'm a small needy person.

414
00:25:53,918 --> 00:25:55,283
I'll give it for 10 lakhs.

415
00:25:55,586 --> 00:25:58,111
It'll get me a car and everything else.

416
00:25:58,956 --> 00:26:01,049
You tell, just think of it. Think.

417
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,059
Tell anything.

418
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,886
Anything? - Yes.

419
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:09,125
You are taking so much time.

420
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,826
Don't feel shy.

421
00:26:10,968 --> 00:26:11,900
What's the price?

422
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:13,631
68 rupees. - What?

423
00:26:13,871 --> 00:26:15,566
Oh no! Has it increased again?

424
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,971
Look, it's written over there.

425
00:26:20,244 --> 00:26:21,939
Are you giving gold through these pipes?

426
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,080
Here take it.

427
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,877
10 crores. - What?

428
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:26,341
I've decided.

429
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:29,313
Price for one night will be 10 crores.

430
00:26:30,354 --> 00:26:34,814
Wow my friend. You are
roaming around with a helicopter.

431
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:39,322
Brother, brother, look,
sister-in-law in the taxi.

432
00:26:39,964 --> 00:26:41,659
Oh yes, let's go, let's go.

433
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:54,610
Let Cupid bless me today
and I'll turn Mohan's house..

434
00:26:54,712 --> 00:26:57,545
..into Mohan-jodaro.

435
00:26:57,581 --> 00:26:58,809
Be victorious.

436
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,108
But do you have
protection? - No, my friend.

437
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,010
Doesn't matter I'll use polythene.

438
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:07,786
Take it. Enjoy! - Oh!

439
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:08,985
Just check the expiry date.

440
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,993
Situ, you are my true brother.

441
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:13,587
Tonight will be in your name.

442
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:15,661
Yes ma'am.

443
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,861
One ticket for Lajpat
Nagar please. - Sure ma'am.

444
00:27:18,135 --> 00:27:21,866
Like any other guy my
weakness was also girls.

445
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:25,675
But fate had planned
something different that night.

446
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:29,778
Hello there.

447
00:27:31,582 --> 00:27:34,346
Look mister, you are
following me from the hotel.

448
00:27:34,618 --> 00:27:36,813
Stop chasing me
and get going from here..

449
00:27:36,954 --> 00:27:38,649
..before I do anything to you.

450
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,849
Ouch!

451
00:27:44,962 --> 00:27:46,054
Your bag.

452
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,090
What happened? Why are you laughing?

453
00:27:51,235 --> 00:27:53,294
No, why did you have to do all this?

454
00:27:53,871 --> 00:27:54,860
What did I do?

455
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:58,608
We've seen in films that the
girl lashes out at the guy first..

456
00:27:58,642 --> 00:28:01,042
..and then slips and
falls in order to bring him close.

457
00:28:02,012 --> 00:28:03,138
What nonsense is this?

458
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:04,570
Okay, doesn't matter.

459
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:08,116
But Delhi is not a safe
place for beautiful girls at night.

460
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:10,150
Come on I'll drop you. - What nonsense!

461
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:12,617
Madam, listen to me.

462
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:15,851
Excuse me sir.

463
00:28:17,027 --> 00:28:18,517
Sir that guy is disturbing me a lot.

464
00:28:19,296 --> 00:28:20,285
And that's why..

465
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:23,323
..I got trapped because of
that loser, frustrated, gay girl.

466
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,769
In that bogie of the last
metro at 11:40 God had sent..

467
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:31,200
..the love letter of my death
through the gorgeous girl in sari..

468
00:28:31,675 --> 00:28:35,133
..because He knew that I would
take it if the girl gives it to me.

469
00:28:54,064 --> 00:28:55,759
Hey stop! Stop! Hey!

470
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,532
Stop!

471
00:28:57,568 --> 00:28:58,557
You cannot escape.

472
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:03,638
Come on. - Yes sir.

473
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:21,949
Where did the scoundrel escape?

474
00:29:21,992 --> 00:29:23,289
You go there. -
Yes sir. - You come here.

475
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:33,258
Oh!

476
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,636
I'm talking to you.

477
00:29:37,641 --> 00:29:38,835
Hey you Phantom!

478
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:43,246
Get down the bus is going to the depot.

479
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,680
You are going to
stop at Lajpatnagar depot.

480
00:29:45,716 --> 00:29:46,774
I'll get down there, uncle.

481
00:29:46,884 --> 00:29:48,613
I'll take it to your house.

482
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,552
Are you my relative?

483
00:29:50,654 --> 00:29:51,951
Get down. - Oh!

484
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,990
Look, I'll take out the rod. - Oh no!

485
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:56,321
I'll hit you. Get down!

486
00:29:59,897 --> 00:30:01,125
Auto! Stop! Stop!

487
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:02,893
Brother, Lajpatnagar.

488
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,694
Take extra money.

489
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:06,201
Oh no!

490
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,233
Sir! - Yes Dhondiyal.

491
00:30:10,908 --> 00:30:12,034
Sir, there is a problem.

492
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,771
The boy has escaped from the station.

493
00:30:13,944 --> 00:30:15,969
Dhondoiyal if you cannot get
that guy then you'll commit suicide..

494
00:30:16,013 --> 00:30:17,640
..at my hands. - Sir, I..

495
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:20,878
And listen; find out the
girl he was chasing. - Okay sir.

496
00:30:21,018 --> 00:30:22,781
Inform your mobile vans.

497
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,813
If you are unable to catch them
Dhondiyal I'll cut all your three legs.

498
00:30:27,591 --> 00:30:28,717
Sir..

499
00:30:29,593 --> 00:30:31,322
Three legs?

500
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:33,720
Oh no!

501
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:07,264
Sir, veg cheese grilled sandwich.

502
00:31:07,698 --> 00:31:09,928
Delivery boy, Good Luck bakery.

503
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,126
Do you have a watch with you?

504
00:31:11,201 --> 00:31:12,964
What? Yes, yes.

505
00:31:13,804 --> 00:31:14,793
Keep it inside.

506
00:31:17,107 --> 00:31:18,734
Keep it inside the box.

507
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:20,800
When you don't know how to
see time why have you worn it?

508
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:22,376
You are an hour late.

509
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,872
We won't eat it now.

510
00:31:23,914 --> 00:31:25,347
Guddu! - Yes master.

511
00:31:25,382 --> 00:31:26,747
Close the shutter.

512
00:31:39,763 --> 00:31:42,789
"Happy birthday to you!""

513
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:46,000
"Happy birthday to you!""

514
00:31:46,103 --> 00:31:50,665
"Happy birthday to dear, dear..""

515
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,006
Mr. Captain.- "..to Mr. Captain""

516
00:31:53,043 --> 00:31:55,944
"Happy birthday to you!""

517
00:31:58,048 --> 00:32:00,949
Happy birthday to you Mr. Captain.

518
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,748
Happy birthday.

519
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,118
Sweeten brother's mouth.

520
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:49,230
Master if you are done
then I will close the shop.

521
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:53,225
Mr. Choudhury he thinks that
we had come here to eat sweets.

522
00:32:53,704 --> 00:32:57,868
Look, we have come from
so far let us loot the shop.

523
00:32:57,908 --> 00:33:00,604
No sir, I'll be ruined. I'll be ruined.

524
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:02,271
I'm not looting you but just the shop.

525
00:33:02,312 --> 00:33:03,142
Allow us to loot it.

526
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:07,116
No, no, I've small kids, I'll be ruined.

527
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,550
He is not going to agree so easily.

528
00:33:09,186 --> 00:33:10,346
Mr. Captain.

529
00:33:13,223 --> 00:33:14,656
Tell me one thing.

530
00:33:15,726 --> 00:33:17,819
The government has
been looting you for so long.

531
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:19,893
Have you said anything? No.

532
00:33:20,097 --> 00:33:21,257
No problem.

533
00:33:21,932 --> 00:33:24,093
Milk has become
expensive, sugar has become expensive.

534
00:33:24,134 --> 00:33:25,795
They are looting you on daily basis.

535
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:27,167
Have you said anything?

536
00:33:27,704 --> 00:33:29,171
No problem.

537
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:33,966
And today four good guys
have come to celebrate my birthday..

538
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:35,205
..then you have problem.

539
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,580
When he does it you
call it tax and when we do it..

540
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:38,638
..you call it robbery.

541
00:33:38,715 --> 00:33:40,842
I have problem!

542
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:49,916
Wow Mr. Captain!
You've solved the problem.

543
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,194
He seems to be insulting us.

544
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:56,561
Increase your score.

545
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,767
What's my score? - 91.

546
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:03,270
At least a century
is needed on a birthday.

547
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:12,109
Will you break your ears?

548
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:15,778
No sir. Forgive me. - Yes! - But..

549
00:34:33,904 --> 00:34:34,928
92.

550
00:34:35,305 --> 00:34:38,570
Hey you scoundrel!

551
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,804
May your mother die, father die.

552
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:42,368
You scoundrel!

553
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,875
I'm near Monalisa Dhaba.

554
00:34:49,386 --> 00:34:50,375
I'm in problem.

555
00:34:50,587 --> 00:34:51,611
Come soon. Please.

556
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:53,953
You take lot of tension. Chill.

557
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,117
It's a police matter.

558
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,651
Brother Tarun is SHO of
the CP police station. - Really?

559
00:34:58,862 --> 00:35:01,296
Even if you had committed
murder your brother would've saved you.

560
00:35:01,331 --> 00:35:02,958
What are you saying? - Do one thing.

561
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,594
Don't get caught by the
police tonight and don't go home.

562
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:06,568
But father?

563
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:10,300
I'll call your father and tell
him that you are with me. - Okay, fine.

564
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,106
Go to Mohan's place at Munirka.

565
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:13,969
Go there and chill.

566
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:16,806
Pick up a girl from the road.

567
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:19,744
Why? What happened? - Nothing.

568
00:35:19,783 --> 00:35:21,910
You are the perfect
medicine for tension. - Hello, hello.

569
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:24,311
Situ, hello.

570
00:35:24,788 --> 00:35:26,153
Have you died?

571
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,754
Oh no the battery!

572
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,285
Sir, we had decided
on 7000 for each item.

573
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,255
Now you are talking of 5000.

574
00:35:34,998 --> 00:35:36,363
How does this lipstick look on me?

575
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,828
Why are you asking me?

576
00:35:37,868 --> 00:35:39,768
Ask the person who is going to eat it.

577
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:42,270
They are not the ones from G.B road.

578
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,570
They are of
A-grade quality. Pretty pack.

579
00:35:44,608 --> 00:35:46,166
Give onions. - Okay sir.

580
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,201
Go and give them onions and salad.

581
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,112
Yes sir, 7000.

582
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:53,947
Look. - What? There
Hrithik Roshan. - Where? - Oh my!

583
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,645
Will I get auto here?

584
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:58,711
You get parathas here and not auto.

585
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:00,948
Okay.

586
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:04,824
Oh my! She is such a gorgeous girl!

587
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,528
Is there an auto or taxi stand nearby?

588
00:36:09,566 --> 00:36:10,590
I don't know.

589
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,566
Do one thing.

590
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,096
Go and check this girl.

591
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,266
Find out from where she is coming.

592
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:19,576
Go.

593
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,842
Excuse me! Hello!

594
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,074
Why are you not stopping?

595
00:36:25,115 --> 00:36:26,343
I've recognized you Mr. hello there.

596
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,075
Look, I'm not chasing you now.

597
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:31,779
You've come after me now.

598
00:36:31,888 --> 00:36:33,014
You are sticking on me now.

599
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,621
Hope you haven't
brought those goons with you.

600
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:38,184
Actually the man is following me.

601
00:36:38,228 --> 00:36:39,320
Who?

602
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,227
Hello, Pramod speaking.

603
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:45,367
He got scared. Scoundrel!

604
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:49,304
Thank you. - Welcome.

605
00:36:49,973 --> 00:36:51,235
Shall I say something to you?

606
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:53,303
You shouldn't move
around alone at night.

607
00:36:53,577 --> 00:36:55,010
Perhaps you don't
know that a man roaming..

608
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:58,104
..at night in Delhi is a hunter.

609
00:36:58,315 --> 00:36:59,543
Really? - Yes.

610
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:00,572
Then who are you?

611
00:37:00,984 --> 00:37:02,042
Me?

612
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,280
I'm the protector.

613
00:37:04,821 --> 00:37:06,083
I've set out on a
mission to change Delhi.

614
00:37:06,623 --> 00:37:08,181
I'm Lavina. - Okay.

615
00:37:08,825 --> 00:37:11,157
My name Lokesh, Lokesh Duggal.

616
00:37:11,695 --> 00:37:12,923
Friends call me Lucky.

617
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:17,232
Hello! - Hello!

618
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:24,632
By the way it's good
both of us have L initials.

619
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,833
Lokesh, Lavina.

620
00:37:27,744 --> 00:37:29,109
Today's day is very bad for me.

621
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:32,104
I missed the metro and
am not getting an auto too.

622
00:37:32,582 --> 00:37:33,742
I'm also feeling cold.

623
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,046
You are feeling cold?

624
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,278
Then what?

625
00:37:36,553 --> 00:37:38,851
You are wearing such
a thick a jacket not me.

626
00:37:39,856 --> 00:37:40,845
You are right.

627
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,358
It is quite warm.

628
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:43,751
Let's do one thing.

629
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:47,321
Let's go to the inn over
there for a cup of hot tea.

630
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:51,130
It'll make you feel warm and
you'll also get an auto somewhere near.

631
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:53,293
Shall we go? - Okay.

632
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:54,728
Let's go.

633
00:37:55,739 --> 00:37:56,933
Where do you stay?

634
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:59,304
Elisa Girls' Hostel. - Oh no!

635
00:37:59,643 --> 00:38:00,974
Lajpatnagar? - Yeah.

636
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:02,135
Strange.

637
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,874
There is the
Ganodara medical Store, right?

638
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:07,107
Come right from there,
the third house, pink color.

639
00:38:07,217 --> 00:38:08,275
That is my house.

640
00:38:08,318 --> 00:38:10,252
Opposite to Uttam Batora's shop.

641
00:38:10,754 --> 00:38:13,746
The momo seller is
also there, he is my friend.

642
00:38:14,157 --> 00:38:16,125
Many girls from your college come there.

643
00:38:16,593 --> 00:38:17,560
To eat momos.

644
00:38:17,594 --> 00:38:18,322
Really?

645
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:20,319
Then you too must be
a frequent visitor there.

646
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:21,955
To eat momos.

647
00:38:22,065 --> 00:38:23,896
No, no. I don't go.

648
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,729
You too Ms. Lavina.

649
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:28,067
He becomes momos and
gets into their mouths.

650
00:38:28,171 --> 00:38:29,900
He needs to be pulled out.

651
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:34,106
Ms. Lavina.

652
00:38:35,011 --> 00:38:37,741
This is my first
experience of missing the last metro.

653
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:39,679
Yours? - Mine too.

654
00:38:39,983 --> 00:38:42,315
I've a show here after 4
days. - Really? - Thank you.

655
00:38:42,652 --> 00:38:44,950
And I'll have to take
the last metro from here.

656
00:38:45,188 --> 00:38:46,086
Really.

657
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:52,123
If you miss that one then
call this freelance protector.

658
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:53,662
Of course.

659
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,002
What shall I bring for you sir?

660
00:39:01,037 --> 00:39:05,303
Bring two hot piping tea
and two special Monalisa parathas.

661
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,601
Add extra onions to them.

662
00:39:07,277 --> 00:39:08,642
What is this?

663
00:39:09,746 --> 00:39:11,737
Nothing just rose water.

664
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,943
My eyes hurt a bit. For them.

665
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:17,852
Where are you from?

666
00:39:17,954 --> 00:39:19,012
Dehradun.

667
00:39:19,122 --> 00:39:20,714
Dehradun is a wonderful place.

668
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:23,156
I've heard two things are famous there.

669
00:39:23,593 --> 00:39:25,322
One is Mall Road and
the second is the Bell House.

670
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,589
If the item is on road then
what will happen in the Bell house?

671
00:39:28,732 --> 00:39:30,666
Everything will happen on road.

672
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,598
Oh my!

673
00:39:38,074 --> 00:39:39,564
Lavina, sit here.

674
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,349
Now we cannot see her legs.

675
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,784
This guy has covered it up.

676
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,589
Don't worry, get my x-ray glasses.

677
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:58,821
Take it.

678
00:39:59,362 --> 00:40:00,886
Here, hot tea.

679
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:04,698
Oh my!

680
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:08,327
Someone is going to
die at my hands today.

681
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,668
What can you see brother? Tell me.

682
00:40:10,707 --> 00:40:13,175
Don't disturb an
English movie is going on.

683
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,708
Shut up you cheap morons!

684
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,246
I wish to get inside
the blanket of your English.

685
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,748
Lavina, ignore
them. They are cheap people.

686
00:40:22,786 --> 00:40:23,844
We won't argue with them.

687
00:40:23,887 --> 00:40:24,945
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

688
00:40:24,988 --> 00:40:26,080
Is our mouth very dirty?

689
00:40:26,156 --> 00:40:27,851
We also use an English brush.

690
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:29,922
Chotu, keep the change.

691
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,690
Let's follow the item.

692
00:40:35,732 --> 00:40:38,200
There is no use
arguing with such cheap people.

693
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:43,269
Hey you boy, give the tape.

694
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,230
Which tape, brother? Which tape?

695
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:46,640
Hey! Don't act smart.

696
00:40:46,676 --> 00:40:47,734
Quietly take out the tape.

697
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:49,005
What are you doing? - Take out the tape.

698
00:40:49,112 --> 00:40:50,704
Leave him! Leave him!

699
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,940
What are you doing
brother? Leave my jacket. Which tape?

700
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:54,016
What do you want?

701
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,210
Is there anyone? Please help!

702
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,587
Bring four more parathas.

703
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,552
Someone please help!

704
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,020
Let's go to help the girl.

705
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:02,183
They are molesting the girl.

706
00:41:02,225 --> 00:41:04,921
Let it be. You couldn't save yourself.

707
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,121
What can you do for her?

708
00:41:07,063 --> 00:41:08,325
He is not going to
listen in this way. - Leave!

709
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:09,889
Leave!

710
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:11,359
Police!

711
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,001
Check him. Check. - Police!

712
00:41:14,037 --> 00:41:16,130
Oh no! Close the door.

713
00:41:18,141 --> 00:41:19,699
Give the tape. - Police!

714
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:20,675
Run! Run! - Police!

715
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,143
We'll see him later. - But..

716
00:41:22,345 --> 00:41:25,075
Come on I'll tell you. - But,
police.. - Come on I'll tell you.

717
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,382
Hey auto, auto, auto.

718
00:41:31,588 --> 00:41:33,988
Stop! Stop! Stop! -
Auto! - Stop! - Auto. Auto. Auto.

719
00:41:34,057 --> 00:41:36,787
Bloody hell! - Oh no!

720
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:38,020
What's going on Lokesh?

721
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:38,958
Who were those people?

722
00:41:38,995 --> 00:41:39,962
Which tape were they talking about?

723
00:41:39,996 --> 00:41:41,327
I don't know those crazy people.

724
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:44,059
But you were with me today.

725
00:41:44,734 --> 00:41:45,996
So they were spared.

726
00:41:47,003 --> 00:41:49,938
I just had to make one
call and Delhi would've changed.

727
00:41:50,607 --> 00:41:51,869
But I've seen their faces.

728
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,034
They don't know that I work for NSVP.

729
00:41:55,345 --> 00:41:56,778
National Students Vidya
Parishad and the President..

730
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,614
..treats me like his brother.

731
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,945
Not India's President but the party's.

732
00:42:02,886 --> 00:42:04,148
India's President
will also respect me one day.

733
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:09,225
I won't come with you
unless you tell me the truth.

734
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:10,851
I swear on you, I'm
telling you the truth.

735
00:42:11,127 --> 00:42:12,719
Then why did you run from the police?

736
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:15,122
Oh no! I'll tell you. Come on.

737
00:42:18,935 --> 00:42:20,664
So, this is my strange story.

738
00:42:21,304 --> 00:42:22,328
Meaning?

739
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:28,870
It means when this
happens then this is the outcome.

740
00:42:28,912 --> 00:42:29,936
Meaning?

741
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:37,185
It means that when this
happens then this become like this.

742
00:42:37,387 --> 00:42:39,855
What nonsense are you speaking Lokesh?

743
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,090
So you didn't know
the girl with the letter?

744
00:42:43,126 --> 00:42:44,184
Not at all.

745
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:48,093
I don't know from
where she came to dig my grave.

746
00:42:48,765 --> 00:42:50,665
The last metro was fateful for me.

747
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:53,726
She just cut me off.

748
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:57,966
Now that you are telling the
truth tell the truth about the tape too.

749
00:42:59,142 --> 00:43:02,976
I feel that there is a
double role related to that tape.

750
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:04,773
The Ram and Shyam type.

751
00:43:04,914 --> 00:43:08,577
Shyam commits all the crimes
and it's Ram who suffers for them.

752
00:43:08,618 --> 00:43:09,744
Ram-Shyam.

753
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,783
You are damn funny Lokesh.

754
00:43:11,821 --> 00:43:13,152
Ram-Shyam. Sins.

755
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,284
You are really great Lucky.

756
00:43:15,558 --> 00:43:18,755
You will impregnate her with your words.

757
00:43:19,896 --> 00:43:24,731
Let's go. Oh no!

758
00:46:05,595 --> 00:46:07,529
Oh no! Even these are empty.

759
00:46:08,531 --> 00:46:10,897
I don't feel we'll get any auto today.

760
00:46:11,734 --> 00:46:13,827
It seems difficult to reach
home in this condition, isn't it?

761
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,165
Oh god!

762
00:46:15,705 --> 00:46:16,933
My heels are killing me.

763
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:19,036
My legs are hurting a lot.

764
00:46:19,342 --> 00:46:20,274
Really?

765
00:46:22,245 --> 00:46:24,713
I've a friend called Mohan.

766
00:46:24,747 --> 00:46:25,941
His house in Munirka.

767
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:27,843
Let's go and take rest in his house.

768
00:46:27,884 --> 00:46:30,944
We'll get a metro in the morning, right?

769
00:46:33,723 --> 00:46:38,057
He is marriage
material and I'm a protector too.

770
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,291
I hate such decent girls.

771
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:45,727
Okay.

772
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:49,867
Mr. Captain.

773
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,134
What happened, Mr. Captain?

774
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,001
This is the respect that I get, right?

775
00:46:56,279 --> 00:46:58,509
This is the respect
that I have in your eyes.

776
00:46:59,582 --> 00:47:01,777
You'll steal a penny
on your Captain's birthday.

777
00:47:02,051 --> 00:47:04,747
It's my 33rd birthday. 33rd.

778
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:08,054
I had committed more
thefts on my 9th birthday.

779
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,756
I did not give this
vehicle on rent today thinking that..

780
00:47:11,794 --> 00:47:14,194
..I'll celebrate by
birthday with grandeur and loot Delhi.

781
00:47:14,697 --> 00:47:16,255
You all are happy with petty thefts.

782
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,533
You are happy sealing sweets.

783
00:47:19,802 --> 00:47:22,168
Shall I celebrate my
birthday with 10 rupee notes?

784
00:47:23,806 --> 00:47:25,034
Mr. Captain.

785
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:30,975
Your birth is a gift for us.

786
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:35,707
For me for Bhati
brother for Mr. Choudhury.

787
00:47:35,952 --> 00:47:37,943
Today is Captain's birth anniversary.

788
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:42,722
Mr. Captain tomorrow's
newspaper will carry the news of..

789
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:44,989
..your birthday celebrations
and not that of Mahatma Gandhi.

790
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:45,858
Yes.

791
00:47:45,895 --> 00:47:47,226
Come on Mr. Captain.

792
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:48,927
Everything is left for you.

793
00:47:48,965 --> 00:47:50,262
The entire night is left.

794
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,860
Delhi is full of
bounties. Sit inside the car.

795
00:47:52,902 --> 00:47:54,995
Keep quiet and go. - Yes.

796
00:47:55,104 --> 00:47:56,196
Go! - Yeah.

797
00:48:01,744 --> 00:48:03,507
I'll manage something.

798
00:50:26,689 --> 00:50:27,656
Guggu.

799
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:34,120
Wait!

800
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:38,893
Guggu, go.

801
00:50:53,649 --> 00:50:54,809
What's there in this box?

802
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:59,852
Sir, nothing.

803
00:51:05,928 --> 00:51:07,327
He slapped me very hard, uncle.

804
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:08,721
Even damaged my ear drums.

805
00:51:10,266 --> 00:51:11,597
He also ate all the pizzas.

806
00:51:15,271 --> 00:51:16,932
Uncle, uncle.

807
00:51:17,273 --> 00:51:18,297
Uncle, stop!

808
00:51:18,774 --> 00:51:21,265
Uncle, spare my Guggu.

809
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:22,669
I've made the mistake.

810
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:23,940
Punish me.

811
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,570
I'm punishing you, my nephew.

812
00:51:25,815 --> 00:51:28,750
First you destroyed the cake,
then the sandwich and now the pizza.

813
00:51:28,918 --> 00:51:30,010
I'll definitely recover them.

814
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:31,814
I'll sell the tape now.

815
00:51:32,054 --> 00:51:35,615
If you incur further losses
I'll break this bike and sold it off.

816
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:37,283
You'll come back to your cycle status.

817
00:51:37,326 --> 00:51:40,853
Don't talk; don't
talk about status, uncle.

818
00:51:41,397 --> 00:51:43,991
I've saved every hard
earned penny to buy my Guggu.

819
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:46,067
My Guggu is my pride, uncle.

820
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:48,803
Please spare my Guggu, uncle.

821
00:51:49,305 --> 00:51:51,296
If you wish you can sell my kidney.

822
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:53,201
I'll sell your kidney too.

823
00:51:53,242 --> 00:51:54,140
Let the time come.

824
00:51:54,343 --> 00:51:58,143
If you mess up the Chattarpur
delivery then I'll sell your kidney too.

825
00:51:58,214 --> 00:51:59,203
Move aside.

826
00:52:09,058 --> 00:52:13,256
I lost my ears and you your voice.

827
00:52:16,866 --> 00:52:18,925
We are facing one
trouble after another today.

828
00:52:19,268 --> 00:52:20,792
I don't know which area is this.

829
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:22,694
The mobile battery is also dead.

830
00:52:22,805 --> 00:52:23,897
You at least have your mobile.

831
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,201
My one lost its
life in the road side inn.

832
00:52:26,876 --> 00:52:28,673
I don't know where we got trapped.

833
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:32,039
You know I am dying to go to the loo.

834
00:52:32,248 --> 00:52:35,081
Why do you girls feel the
urge to go to bathroom so often?

835
00:52:35,384 --> 00:52:36,715
Bathroom!

836
00:52:36,886 --> 00:52:38,854
And that too at such a strange time.

837
00:52:38,888 --> 00:52:39,980
Shut up!

838
00:52:41,624 --> 00:52:42,989
Hi He-man!

839
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,720
Hello Lavina! - Hi!

840
00:52:44,994 --> 00:52:47,963
Has this lovely couple come
out for a night walk at this time?

841
00:52:48,364 --> 00:52:49,854
No sir.

842
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:52,100
Actually we were
going to Lajpatnagar and..

843
00:52:52,201 --> 00:52:53,862
..we got no auto so..

844
00:52:53,903 --> 00:52:56,303
Oh! If you both
want I can drop you there.

845
00:52:56,572 --> 00:52:58,870
But there is a small stop before that.

846
00:52:58,941 --> 00:53:00,033
Is it fine with you?

847
00:53:03,546 --> 00:53:04,843
Hello there. - Hi!

848
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,938
Shall I sit here?

849
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:08,548
Sorry.

850
00:53:08,584 --> 00:53:09,243
It's fine.

851
00:53:09,285 --> 00:53:10,946
You've sat on the gent's seat.

852
00:53:11,787 --> 00:53:13,584
Rohit where will we go first?

853
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:17,992
We are going to Bamby's party.

854
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,693
Hi Rohit! - Hi Christy!

855
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:27,725
Hey Hi!

856
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:32,070
Ladies and gentlemen here
comes a legendary man-eater of Delhi.

857
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:33,905
Rohit Pichwadia.

858
00:53:40,783 --> 00:53:42,683
What a wonderful party.

859
00:53:42,718 --> 00:53:44,879
All hail Bamby! - Yeah!

860
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,251
All hail Bamby!

861
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:47,882
Oh no!

862
00:53:47,923 --> 00:53:51,154
And now let me tell you the
reason of the celebration tonight.

863
00:53:51,193 --> 00:53:52,820
Bamby's respected father..

864
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:57,299
..call him respected, a most
corrupt and inspirational politician..

865
00:53:57,333 --> 00:54:00,598
..our ex-agriculture minister
on whom the opposition leveled..

866
00:54:00,736 --> 00:54:04,001
..true charges of corruption
and a case was filed against him.

867
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:08,909
And finally today he
has been given clean chit.

868
00:54:12,548 --> 00:54:14,311
He must have bribed
god knows how many people..

869
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:17,251
..to get that clean chit.

870
00:54:17,286 --> 00:54:21,848
And I believe that one day
Bamby will be as spoilt and..

871
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:23,882
..as powerful like his father.

872
00:54:23,926 --> 00:54:24,984
Yeah!

873
00:54:27,096 --> 00:54:31,192
And now Bamby will
talk to the public now.

874
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:32,892
Thank you public.

875
00:54:32,935 --> 00:54:36,701
Well, I'll try my best to
fulfill all your expectations.

876
00:54:36,872 --> 00:54:41,309
But now, I am more
spoilt than my father.

877
00:54:42,645 --> 00:54:44,806
There are two types
of people in this world.

878
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:50,016
One who is corrupt and
second those who want to be corrupt..

879
00:54:50,052 --> 00:54:53,078
..and I'm the second type of man.

880
00:54:55,257 --> 00:54:58,954
So, rejoice all you people
because the ultimate solution to..

881
00:54:58,994 --> 00:55:03,328
..every bloody thing in
this country is corruption.

882
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:04,860
Hail corruption!

883
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,595
Hail corruption!

884
00:55:16,779 --> 00:55:19,179
Sir, can I help you?

885
00:55:19,281 --> 00:55:21,749
Sir, pizza. Delivery boy.

886
00:55:21,817 --> 00:55:25,218
Hey our friend here
has got us pizzas here.

887
00:55:26,288 --> 00:55:27,812
Pizza. - Pizza.

888
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:29,051
Oh it's hot!

889
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,285
Enjoy the party buddy.

890
00:55:32,828 --> 00:55:34,022
Sir, bill.

891
00:55:39,902 --> 00:55:41,062
Drink, sir.

892
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:42,634
Me?

893
00:55:49,678 --> 00:55:51,737
Sir, drink. - Yes.

894
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:54,313
He doesn't drink. - Okay.

895
00:55:55,317 --> 00:55:57,842
Soft drink. - Thank you.

896
00:55:57,887 --> 00:55:58,876
You are welcome.

897
00:55:58,921 --> 00:56:00,912
I'll just go to
the ladies' room. - Okay.

898
00:56:03,592 --> 00:56:05,184
Why do the girls
use the bathroom so often?

899
00:56:20,776 --> 00:56:24,542
Oh you are the one who
caught Rohit like a ball.

900
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,604
Aren't you?

901
00:56:26,048 --> 00:56:30,041
Oh then we owe you a good time. - Yes.

902
00:56:31,053 --> 00:56:33,578
Would you like to catch me if I fall?

903
00:56:35,257 --> 00:56:36,690
I'll die.

904
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:39,192
What's your name miss? - Marcha.

905
00:56:39,328 --> 00:56:40,795
Oh my god!

906
00:56:54,243 --> 00:56:55,642
Room inside a room.

907
00:57:11,293 --> 00:57:12,123
Come, come.

908
00:57:12,161 --> 00:57:13,890
Oh no! One more room.

909
00:57:15,564 --> 00:57:16,326
Welcome.

910
00:57:16,532 --> 00:57:17,226
Hello there.

911
00:57:29,311 --> 00:57:32,109
You are handsome. - Thank you.

912
00:57:32,548 --> 00:57:34,311
You've got nice eyes.

913
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:36,711
Oh I'll die for you.

914
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:38,218
You like me? - Yes.

915
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:39,278
No, you like me.

916
00:57:39,321 --> 00:57:40,913
No, you like me.

917
00:57:40,956 --> 00:57:42,753
No, you like me.

918
00:57:42,858 --> 00:57:44,553
No, you like me.

919
00:57:44,593 --> 00:57:45,821
I like you all.

920
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:49,724
I am all of you like, yes babies.

921
00:57:49,865 --> 00:57:50,889
Excuse me.

922
00:57:51,233 --> 00:57:52,359
We are friends with Rohit.

923
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:53,861
Have you seen Lokesh?

924
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:55,871
He is lost swimming.

925
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:57,668
He is diving deep in the ocean of love.

926
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:04,144
Love. Love. 69.

927
00:58:04,179 --> 00:58:06,841
He is mine. - He's mine.

928
00:58:06,882 --> 00:58:08,110
Shut up you nbitch he is mine.

929
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:09,774
He is mine. - He's mine.

930
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:11,250
No fine. - No, he's mine.

931
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:14,779
I'm loving all you together.

932
00:58:14,823 --> 00:58:16,051
Okay, okay, okay.

933
00:58:16,091 --> 00:58:17,820
Inky, pinky ponky.

934
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,321
Pinky's ponky.

935
00:58:20,529 --> 00:58:23,760
Inky pinky ponky.

936
00:58:23,799 --> 00:58:26,700
Inky pinky ponky.

937
00:58:26,802 --> 00:58:28,793
Wow!

938
00:58:39,815 --> 00:58:40,782
Oh no!

939
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:45,620
Sir, sir, Rohit sir.. - I'm
sorry baby, please don't mind.

940
00:58:45,654 --> 00:58:46,746
I'll be next, huh?

941
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:48,989
Who is this old bull huh?

942
00:58:49,024 --> 00:58:50,355
Hey, hey, leave my things.

943
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,754
Sorry darling. You'll be fine.

944
00:58:54,296 --> 00:58:55,957
Sir, sir give my money.

945
00:58:55,998 --> 00:58:57,022
Please.

946
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:59,762
Don't make us laugh any
more. Have mercy on us Jackie Chan.

947
00:59:00,869 --> 00:59:03,963
Oh my god how cute he is like a dog.

948
00:59:04,106 --> 00:59:06,074
I hope I could make him my pet.

949
00:59:07,209 --> 00:59:10,007
Hey guys, look at the
cotton coming out of his ears man.

950
00:59:10,145 --> 00:59:12,613
Jackie Chan, can you
hear what we are saying?

951
00:59:13,148 --> 00:59:14,911
Hello! Ding dong, ding dong.

952
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:17,783
Hey cartoon, you want money?

953
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,150
Yes.

954
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:21,918
Okay, tell your name first. - Nunna.

955
00:59:23,859 --> 00:59:27,556
It might be yours but mine is strong.

956
00:59:28,764 --> 00:59:30,664
You want money Nunna? - Yes.

957
00:59:30,933 --> 00:59:32,195
Here is your money.

958
00:59:32,234 --> 00:59:33,326
Come on.

959
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:36,934
Come on. - Oh!

960
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:40,609
This time I won't raise it up.

961
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,210
Come on jump. Nunna.

962
00:59:42,244 --> 00:59:43,905
Come on. - Come on Nunna.

963
00:59:43,946 --> 00:59:45,743
Jump! Jump! Jump!

964
00:59:45,781 --> 00:59:47,942
Nunna! Nunna! Nunna! - Come on jump!

965
00:59:47,983 --> 00:59:50,008
Nunna! Nunna! Nunna! - Oh!

966
00:59:50,819 --> 00:59:52,309
Come on Jackie Chan jump.

967
00:59:52,354 --> 00:59:54,822
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

968
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:57,155
Nunna! Nunna! Nunna!

969
00:59:57,192 --> 00:59:59,626
Nunna! Nunna! Nunna!

970
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:02,096
Nunna! Nunna! Nunna!

971
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:04,565
Nunna! Nunna! Nunna!

972
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,591
Nunna! Nunna! Nunna!

973
01:00:06,635 --> 01:00:09,365
Nunna! Nunna! Nunna!

974
01:00:09,571 --> 01:00:11,801
Nunna! Nunna! Nunna!

975
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:49,710
Look, there is a
price of every man's prestige.

976
01:00:49,745 --> 01:00:51,042
I too have a price
and you too might have one.

977
01:00:51,647 --> 01:00:54,810
They are assaulting me
without paying any price.

978
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:57,777
Oh god he is mad!

979
01:00:57,986 --> 01:00:59,214
He is a monster.

980
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:01,779
He bit off my ears and also Ria's.

981
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:02,620
You must have him.

982
01:01:02,658 --> 01:01:04,057
Come on Rocco, come on.

983
01:01:04,693 --> 01:01:07,161
Rohit, come quickly, come fast darling.

984
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:10,665
I'll be back baby.

985
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,208
Nice.

986
01:01:23,912 --> 01:01:26,005
If you are done shall we leave?

987
01:01:36,792 --> 01:01:38,316
Is there a key? - Yes there is.

988
01:01:39,094 --> 01:01:40,152
Come sit.

989
01:01:40,896 --> 01:01:42,056
Hail Goddess.

990
01:01:45,834 --> 01:01:47,165
Let's go!

991
01:02:09,057 --> 01:02:10,684
My Guggu!

992
01:02:14,563 --> 01:02:17,726
Lokesh hurry up, the mad
man is still running after us.

993
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,238
Did all the mad men of
Delhi have to run after us tonight?

994
01:02:28,043 --> 01:02:31,911
Great Mr. Captain. Great.

995
01:02:41,857 --> 01:02:43,688
What's the matter Mr. Captain?

996
01:02:43,725 --> 01:02:45,158
You are not driving carefully.

997
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:46,955
Both of them have been spared alive.

998
01:02:52,067 --> 01:02:53,091
Are you fine?

999
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:57,238
I've not taken down the
number else I would've destroyed them.

1000
01:02:59,007 --> 01:03:00,338
It's hurting.

1001
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:02,333
But what will we do now?

1002
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:06,707
Come.

1003
01:03:09,151 --> 01:03:10,345
It's a crazy night.

1004
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:11,778
I've just been saved from getting raped.

1005
01:03:14,756 --> 01:03:16,348
Give my jacket.

1006
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:18,287
No, I'm feeling cold.

1007
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:19,652
Oh no!

1008
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:23,927
I left my waist coat
over there in all this chaos.

1009
01:03:24,366 --> 01:03:25,731
Go and get it.

1010
01:03:26,001 --> 01:03:28,196
Remember that every man
roaming in Delhi at night..

1011
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:29,602
..is a hunter.

1012
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:33,074
Girls are hunted not guys.

1013
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:36,738
I fail to understand
the strange likes of the rich.

1014
01:03:37,112 --> 01:03:38,773
Lokesh, shall I tell something. - Yes.

1015
01:03:38,914 --> 01:03:40,313
You are a good guy.

1016
01:03:41,149 --> 01:03:44,118
But I fail to understand
how you got trapped in this mess.

1017
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:47,950
The police, tape,
politics, what's all this?

1018
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,924
That's nothing.

1019
01:03:50,592 --> 01:03:51,786
You got hurt.

1020
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:55,762
I was just making up to impress you.

1021
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:58,528
Look.

1022
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:02,266
Atma Ram College, M.A
Political Science, first year student.

1023
01:04:02,671 --> 01:04:04,605
I am an ordinary man. Check me for free.

1024
01:04:04,873 --> 01:04:06,807
Not a worker of
NSVP or anything like that.

1025
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:12,080
But I do want to become one
to rip off these corrupt people.

1026
01:04:12,948 --> 01:04:15,109
But to become one you need to bribe.

1027
01:04:15,217 --> 01:04:16,741
11,000 rupees party fund.

1028
01:04:17,819 --> 01:04:21,050
If I got trapped in anything
it is because of that last metro.

1029
01:04:21,823 --> 01:04:24,621
For the sari clad
woman whom I don't even know.

1030
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,119
You are telling the truth, right?

1031
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:27,853
I swear on the goddess.

1032
01:04:32,567 --> 01:04:38,267
Look, one day we'll have
this big a garden in our bungalow.

1033
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:42,269
I'll remove that pitch
and make a swimming pool.

1034
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:45,175
There will be beer
instead of water in the pool.

1035
01:04:45,614 --> 01:04:48,208
All the friends will
take joyful dips in it.

1036
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:49,945
And no tube lights.

1037
01:04:50,185 --> 01:04:52,710
I want to put up flood
lights like this in the garden.

1038
01:04:53,121 --> 01:04:55,089
Yes, and they'll remain
switched off like these ones.

1039
01:04:55,123 --> 01:04:55,919
Why? Why? Why?

1040
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,050
Why will they be switched off?

1041
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:58,752
I'll insert sensors
that work on snap of fingers.

1042
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:00,589
Just snap your fingers
and the lights will be on.

1043
01:05:10,138 --> 01:05:11,230
Oh no!

1044
01:05:11,673 --> 01:05:13,106
I should've asked something else.

1045
01:05:13,642 --> 01:05:14,609
Hands up!

1046
01:05:14,643 --> 01:05:15,610
Hands up!

1047
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,069
Go get him! - Come,
come. - Stop else I'll shoot.

1048
01:05:18,113 --> 01:05:19,808
Come on Lavina. - Catch the scoundrel.

1049
01:05:19,848 --> 01:05:21,679
Stop! Stop! - Listen Lokesh, listen.

1050
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:23,742
Catch him.

1051
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,111
Stop!

1052
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:27,754
Hey you! Stop!

1053
01:05:34,663 --> 01:05:35,687
Hands up!

1054
01:05:36,031 --> 01:05:38,158
Sir, sir I'm telling the truth sir.

1055
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,828
I don't even know that woman sir.

1056
01:05:39,868 --> 01:05:41,699
Why and how did she die..

1057
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:42,897
To hell with the girl.

1058
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:44,704
Come on give the tape.

1059
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:45,900
Which tape?

1060
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:47,008
I swear on your mother.

1061
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:48,304
Hey you girl, where is the tape?

1062
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:52,211
Sir, she doesn't know anything.

1063
01:05:52,848 --> 01:05:53,940
She is innocent.

1064
01:05:55,717 --> 01:05:57,275
Sir, the tape is in this jacket.

1065
01:06:09,531 --> 01:06:10,293
Sir.

1066
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:17,903
Look for the tape, the tape.

1067
01:06:17,939 --> 01:06:18,928
Sir.

1068
01:06:19,941 --> 01:06:20,930
The tape isn't there.

1069
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:22,970
It's in the right pocket.

1070
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:26,136
Give my jacket.

1071
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:27,840
I'm feeling cold.

1072
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:32,345
Yes sir, I got it.

1073
01:06:33,922 --> 01:06:34,854
The tape.

1074
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,154
Why are you
staring at the innocent girl?

1075
01:06:41,863 --> 01:06:43,990
So the ground under
the lover's feet has slipped.

1076
01:06:44,566 --> 01:06:46,329
We were following you.

1077
01:06:47,102 --> 01:06:50,230
Your beloved had called
us by giving a missed call.

1078
01:06:53,975 --> 01:06:56,944
Now you understand why
every friend is important.

1079
01:06:57,913 --> 01:07:01,679
Now, come on pay this girl for her job.

1080
01:07:03,985 --> 01:07:05,509
It's one lakh, my dear.

1081
01:07:12,861 --> 01:07:14,726
Come on hold it.

1082
01:07:15,897 --> 01:07:17,865
Come on take out the
wire or will you make us hear..

1083
01:07:18,233 --> 01:07:19,996
..what you do at home too.

1084
01:07:24,272 --> 01:07:29,676
Dear, this story had started
when you were in the fashion show party.

1085
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:32,745
Hello there.

1086
01:07:32,781 --> 01:07:34,806
It is said that if you want to
drag the donkey to the river banks..

1087
01:07:34,916 --> 01:07:36,611
..then hang a carrot before it.

1088
01:07:37,018 --> 01:07:39,578
So, we looked for your carrot first.

1089
01:07:40,555 --> 01:07:42,250
And then we found you.

1090
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:43,621
Sir, we got that guy.

1091
01:07:43,658 --> 01:07:45,023
He is in the taxi stand close by.

1092
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:47,290
We could not take
the risk of arresting you.

1093
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:49,661
What if you turn out
to be a rebel like Pandit..

1094
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:51,359
..and hand over the tape
further or don't say anything..

1095
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,160
..then it would be over for us.

1096
01:07:53,268 --> 01:07:56,066
We sent the bait to lure you.

1097
01:07:56,104 --> 01:07:58,698
Brother, is there any
auto or taxi stand nearby?

1098
01:07:59,207 --> 01:08:02,574
We just had to show
the carrot to the donkey.

1099
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:03,839
And finally he is a donkey.

1100
01:08:07,082 --> 01:08:10,609
We had thought of making
you unconscious and searching you.

1101
01:08:10,652 --> 01:08:15,680
We had given your
beloved a weapon for it.

1102
01:08:17,325 --> 01:08:18,223
What's this?

1103
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,659
Nothing just rose water.

1104
01:08:19,694 --> 01:08:21,628
My eyes hurt, it's for them.

1105
01:08:22,230 --> 01:08:24,221
It looks less.

1106
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:25,659
Where have you used them?

1107
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:27,524
Excuse me.

1108
01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:29,899
I had put it in his coke in the party.

1109
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:37,542
Lover boy has lost his senses.

1110
01:08:37,779 --> 01:08:39,804
Now the most important question.

1111
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:41,681
Whom do you work for?

1112
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:44,245
Who has conspired against the minister?

1113
01:08:44,686 --> 01:08:47,246
And if you don't
tell us we won't kill you..

1114
01:08:47,822 --> 01:08:50,848
..but will jail you for only 14 years.

1115
01:08:50,992 --> 01:08:52,857
And will kill you every day.

1116
01:08:53,995 --> 01:08:55,019
With ease.

1117
01:08:55,063 --> 01:08:56,155
Sir, what have I done sir?

1118
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:57,927
We'll tell you.

1119
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:00,128
Aarti.

1120
01:09:01,002 --> 01:09:02,629
Ms. Aarti.

1121
01:09:14,749 --> 01:09:15,738
Ms. Anamka.

1122
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:18,917
Not Anamika but Aarti.

1123
01:09:19,654 --> 01:09:20,951
Arti Utaru.

1124
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:24,725
ASI Arti Utaru.

1125
01:09:41,576 --> 01:09:43,271
Sir, shall I undress him?

1126
01:09:44,679 --> 01:09:45,668
Yes, please.

1127
01:09:47,649 --> 01:09:49,116
It happened a long time back.

1128
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:51,549
You and I were having an affair.

1129
01:09:51,786 --> 01:09:53,617
You promised to marry me.

1130
01:09:53,655 --> 01:09:55,179
I became the mother of your child.

1131
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:57,621
Then you went back on
your promise to marry me.

1132
01:09:57,759 --> 01:10:02,628
You mentally tortured me so
badly that I committed suicide.

1133
01:10:03,598 --> 01:10:06,158
At the moment my dead
body is in Safdarjung hospital.

1134
01:10:06,901 --> 01:10:09,335
I have five witnesses to prove it.

1135
01:10:09,938 --> 01:10:13,339
If necessary I can bring five more.

1136
01:10:13,975 --> 01:10:16,239
Congratulations for
14 years of imprisonment.

1137
01:10:19,147 --> 01:10:21,308
But, but Ana.. Ms. Aarti,

1138
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,980
..I'm meeting you
for the first time today.

1139
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,988
So what? How does it matter to us?

1140
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:31,319
Sir, he has been undressed.

1141
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:33,084
Shall I leave now?

1142
01:10:33,795 --> 01:10:34,921
Yes, leave.

1143
01:10:37,332 --> 01:10:40,130
The rest of you go back to duty.

1144
01:10:40,168 --> 01:10:42,363
Sir, shall I go now?

1145
01:10:50,378 --> 01:10:54,041
Sir, keep this money.

1146
01:10:54,382 --> 01:10:55,747
I don't want it.

1147
01:10:56,084 --> 01:10:59,110
Madam, only two
things keeps a person quiet.

1148
01:10:59,354 --> 01:11:00,821
Bribe and bullets.

1149
01:11:01,556 --> 01:11:02,545
Which one do you prefer?

1150
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:10,254
Hello! Yes sir.

1151
01:11:10,865 --> 01:11:12,162
Querishi, talk to him.

1152
01:11:13,601 --> 01:11:14,295
Hello.

1153
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:16,201
Yes sir, the minister
was asking if you have..

1154
01:11:16,237 --> 01:11:17,295
..found that boy or that tape?

1155
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:18,601
Yes. Querishi we've got the tape.

1156
01:11:18,807 --> 01:11:20,240
We are in the stadium
and the tape is in my pocket.

1157
01:11:20,308 --> 01:11:22,833
Great sir! Talk to the minister. - Yes.

1158
01:11:24,312 --> 01:11:25,210
Yes sir.

1159
01:11:25,613 --> 01:11:26,978
Have you got it, Sisodiya?

1160
01:11:27,148 --> 01:11:28,240
Yes sir we've got the tape.

1161
01:11:28,783 --> 01:11:29,909
Thank you sir.

1162
01:11:31,653 --> 01:11:33,018
No sir. We didn't come to know that.

1163
01:11:33,054 --> 01:11:34,021
He is not telling anything

1164
01:11:36,791 --> 01:11:37,815
Yes sir, that'll be fine.

1165
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:39,154
Hey, stop the girl.

1166
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:40,991
No sir. - Madam..

1167
01:11:41,029 --> 01:11:41,893
Come. - There is nothing like that.

1168
01:11:41,963 --> 01:11:42,895
Come. Come. - Okay sir.

1169
01:11:43,398 --> 01:11:44,365
It'll get done, sir.

1170
01:11:44,666 --> 01:11:45,724
Yes. Jai Hind!

1171
01:11:45,867 --> 01:11:46,799
Sir.

1172
01:11:48,703 --> 01:11:50,295
Dhondiyal take back
the money from the girl.

1173
01:11:53,074 --> 01:11:55,338
Shoot both of them.
- Okay sir. - But sir..

1174
01:11:55,377 --> 01:11:57,902
Come on madam. -
Sir, sir wrong have I done?

1175
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:00,540
Come on madam. - What have I done sir?

1176
01:12:00,815 --> 01:12:01,747
Sit.

1177
01:12:03,918 --> 01:12:05,146
Look you get what you do.

1178
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,344
You betrayer, now you too will die.

1179
01:12:07,789 --> 01:12:10,155
Sir, kill her first. Sir.

1180
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:14,061
Shall I waste her by killing her?

1181
01:12:14,562 --> 01:12:15,927
I'll kill her slowly.

1182
01:12:16,631 --> 01:12:20,761
In the dark area over there.

1183
01:12:21,035 --> 01:12:22,093
You'll die first.

1184
01:12:22,737 --> 01:12:24,637
I'll feel ashamed in front of you.

1185
01:12:24,672 --> 01:12:25,661
Please, please sir. - Come on.

1186
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:27,066
Please, please, please sir.

1187
01:12:27,108 --> 01:12:28,006
Sir. - Get ready.

1188
01:12:28,042 --> 01:12:30,567
Sir. Sir.

1189
01:12:30,745 --> 01:12:34,237
The name of Lord Ram
is truth. - No, no, sir.

1190
01:12:43,691 --> 01:12:44,919
Hands up! Hands up!

1191
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:46,017
Hands up!

1192
01:12:50,832 --> 01:12:51,821
Hands up!

1193
01:12:52,834 --> 01:12:54,859
Come on, now give the tape.

1194
01:12:55,103 --> 01:12:57,162
The tape is not with me.

1195
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,106
Sir has taken the tape with him.

1196
01:12:59,841 --> 01:13:01,900
Scoundrel, you've just been slapped now.

1197
01:13:02,076 --> 01:13:05,011
If you try to act smart you'll be shot.

1198
01:13:05,146 --> 01:13:06,340
I'm not lying.

1199
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:08,277
The tape has been taken away by sir.

1200
01:13:09,117 --> 01:13:10,106
Ask him.

1201
01:13:13,354 --> 01:13:15,982
I don't know. - Hey you..

1202
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:19,217
Now you are finished Dhondiyal.

1203
01:13:19,861 --> 01:13:21,624
Even God can't spare you now.

1204
01:13:32,907 --> 01:13:35,034
You broke my Guggu.

1205
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:39,205
Hey, who are you?

1206
01:14:05,573 --> 01:14:06,835
Lokesh.

1207
01:14:07,108 --> 01:14:08,666
Lokesh, stop.

1208
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:10,970
Lokesh! Lokesh! Listen!

1209
01:14:14,582 --> 01:14:16,948
Lokesh! Lokesh, I'm hurt.

1210
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:19,751
Ouch!

1211
01:14:21,322 --> 01:14:22,687
Lokesh!

1212
01:14:24,058 --> 01:14:25,116
Ouch!

1213
01:14:26,027 --> 01:14:27,153
Lokesh!

1214
01:14:28,062 --> 01:14:29,962
Lokesh, can't you hear?

1215
01:14:31,566 --> 01:14:33,124
Lokesh I'm calling you.

1216
01:14:33,167 --> 01:14:35,362
Look, listen to me carefully.

1217
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:37,332
You escaped from
there. It is you good luck.

1218
01:14:38,139 --> 01:14:41,768
If you follow me now
I'll kill you right here.

1219
01:14:42,944 --> 01:14:45,708
You girls should never be trusted.

1220
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:47,147
Really?

1221
01:14:47,248 --> 01:14:48,943
You saved you and helped
you escape from the stadium?

1222
01:14:48,983 --> 01:14:49,813
Tell me.

1223
01:14:49,851 --> 01:14:51,648
You were standing like a statue there.

1224
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,917
I am the one who
helped you escape from there.

1225
01:14:53,955 --> 01:14:55,786
Else you would've
been shot by that inspector.

1226
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:56,891
So you are trying to
show how helpful you are?

1227
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:57,925
Showing how helpful you are?

1228
01:14:58,226 --> 01:15:00,592
You are the one who led to that bullet..

1229
01:15:00,628 --> 01:15:01,526
..that too without any reason.

1230
01:15:01,829 --> 01:15:03,660
One I helped you
thinking you to be a girl.

1231
01:15:03,698 --> 01:15:05,791
I was with you the
whole night and you trapped me.

1232
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:07,299
Why are you
talking to me in this manner?

1233
01:15:07,335 --> 01:15:08,597
Talk to me respectfully.

1234
01:15:08,836 --> 01:15:10,736
You were not
helping me by walking with me.

1235
01:15:10,872 --> 01:15:12,339
Mohan's room is close by.

1236
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:14,098
Let's go there and relax.

1237
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:15,666
You were just
looking for an opportunity.

1238
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:17,644
I know very well
what your intentions were.

1239
01:15:17,812 --> 01:15:19,211
Intentions? Huh?

1240
01:15:19,347 --> 01:15:23,875
You sold me for one lakh and
you are talking of my intentions?

1241
01:15:23,918 --> 01:15:24,942
You cheap.

1242
01:15:28,122 --> 01:15:29,111
You!

1243
01:15:30,625 --> 01:15:32,092
What do you think yourself to be?

1244
01:15:32,126 --> 01:15:33,252
Leave me!

1245
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:39,190
Leave me!

1246
01:15:39,233 --> 01:15:40,325
Let me go.

1247
01:15:41,936 --> 01:15:42,960
Leave me.

1248
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:45,562
Why are you shouting now?

1249
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:46,935
My intentions are not good, right?

1250
01:15:47,141 --> 01:15:48,574
Now I even have an opportunity.

1251
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:49,804
Leave me.

1252
01:15:49,877 --> 01:15:51,037
Leave me.

1253
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:54,007
I was trying to impress you.

1254
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:55,674
Yes, I was looking for an opportunity.

1255
01:15:56,918 --> 01:15:58,783
But I had started liking you.

1256
01:15:59,754 --> 01:16:01,187
I had started believing you.

1257
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:04,852
You talk of intentions, huh?

1258
01:16:34,622 --> 01:16:35,646
Sorry friend.

1259
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:36,987
Forget what's happened.

1260
01:16:37,258 --> 01:16:38,316
Shut up! Lokesh.

1261
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:41,655
I don't want to talk to you.

1262
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:43,594
What do you think? I've trapped you?

1263
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:45,264
I've been trapped because of you.

1264
01:16:46,167 --> 01:16:48,635
Neither had you come
following me to the station nor..

1265
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:50,900
..would that mean inspector caught me.

1266
01:16:51,906 --> 01:16:53,965
I felt that I was
helping him nab a criminal.

1267
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:57,011
I had not asked to pay me one lakh.

1268
01:16:57,045 --> 01:17:01,004
He left me with no option
and told that he'll jail me.

1269
01:17:02,684 --> 01:17:06,814
I felt so bad when I came to
know that you are being trapped.

1270
01:17:07,221 --> 01:17:10,247
That's why I helped
you escape from there.

1271
01:17:10,992 --> 01:17:13,654
But the way you treated me..

1272
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:15,160
Lavina, I am sorry.

1273
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:16,722
Lavina, I'm sorry.

1274
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:30,109
Today I'm missing
your sister-in-law a lot.

1275
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:34,310
Then call her from her
maiden house, Mr. Choudhury.

1276
01:17:34,348 --> 01:17:36,077
Then you'll keep
up the name of the Jats.

1277
01:17:38,019 --> 01:17:41,546
I remember a poem in her name.

1278
01:17:41,689 --> 01:17:43,179
Tell it, tell it.

1279
01:17:43,624 --> 01:17:44,613
Listen to it.

1280
01:17:44,859 --> 01:17:47,692
I miss you badly day and night.

1281
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:49,663
Wow! Wow!

1282
01:17:49,697 --> 01:17:52,598
I miss you badly day and night.

1283
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,893
It keeps me awake all night.

1284
01:17:54,936 --> 01:17:57,200
Great brother. It's very emotional.

1285
01:17:57,238 --> 01:17:59,297
I want to call you right now.

1286
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:02,201
But the girl from the
customer care says that..

1287
01:18:02,243 --> 01:18:05,235
..I have a low balance.

1288
01:18:05,813 --> 01:18:07,246
Wow! Wow!

1289
01:18:07,515 --> 01:18:09,881
It's great!

1290
01:18:10,785 --> 01:18:12,047
Open!

1291
01:18:12,086 --> 01:18:14,520
Why are you not opening?

1292
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:18,183
Hey, have you gone crazy?

1293
01:18:18,326 --> 01:18:19,623
No brother.

1294
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:22,094
I'll open this machine else
I'm not the son of one father.

1295
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:25,028
Oh no!

1296
01:18:47,922 --> 01:18:48,946
Lavina.

1297
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:51,089
Listen!

1298
01:18:51,826 --> 01:18:52,815
You are going on the wrong direction.

1299
01:18:53,094 --> 01:18:54,220
The road is on this side.

1300
01:18:54,729 --> 01:18:55,627
Lavina.

1301
01:18:58,099 --> 01:18:59,157
It's fine.

1302
01:19:00,101 --> 01:19:01,125
How does it matter to me?

1303
01:19:04,839 --> 01:19:06,898
My birthday has been spoilt.

1304
01:19:07,241 --> 01:19:08,868
Don't say so Mr. Captain.

1305
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:10,707
Why won't I say so?

1306
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:42,634
Madam, do you wish to get hunted?

1307
01:19:42,677 --> 01:19:43,575
Excuse me.

1308
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:49,240
Leave me. - Don't shout.

1309
01:19:49,283 --> 01:19:50,250
Lavina.

1310
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:52,717

01:20:18,779 --> 01:20:19,871
Thank you brother.

1330
01:21:00,955 --> 01:21:04,015
Mr. Captain heroine madam wants to go.

1331
01:21:04,058 --> 01:21:05,889
Won't you give her a return gift?

1332
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:08,257
Feed sweets to madam. - Okay.

1333
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:09,957
She is going to become a mother.

1334
01:21:11,098 --> 01:21:12,588
Happy mother's day.

Brother, forgive me brother.

Forgive me.

This is the first time
someone has said sorry to me.

1361
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:10,915
But it's too late now, my friend.

1362
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:13,719

We'll die together.

1366
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:37,006
Are you alive?

01:22:59,607 --> 01:23:01,973
"The body is in danger.""

01:23:03,911 --> 01:23:07,677
"Now take off your dress
quickly, beloved."" - Wow! Wow!

1375
01:23:13,854 --> 01:23:15,549
Don't worry madam.

1376
01:23:15,589 --> 01:23:17,216
Have faith in us in this matter.

1377
01:23:21,829 --> 01:23:23,990
Mr. Captain, the cake is ready.

1378
01:23:24,598 --> 01:23:25,622
Cut it.

1379
01:23:31,005 --> 01:23:33,030
Why have you tied
this cloth on her mouth?

1380
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:35,838
She is too stubborn Mr. Captain.

1381
01:23:36,377 --> 01:23:38,004
How will I kiss
her in English style now?

1382
01:23:38,045 --> 01:23:40,707
Kiss her in Indian style here and there.

1383
01:23:57,965 --> 01:23:59,694
You've slapped her so hard.

1384
01:24:00,134 --> 01:24:02,193
She has completely switched off.

1385
01:24:15,749 --> 01:24:17,546
Run from here. - Go! Go!

1386
01:24:35,269 --> 01:24:36,896
Oh no!

1387
01:24:38,572 --> 01:24:39,971
Just a couple of minutes Mr. Captain.

1388
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:43,267
Don't start. Rape break.

1389
01:24:44,778 --> 01:24:45,870
Why were you looking inside?

1390
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:48,212
Sorry uncle. Sorry.

1391
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:49,614
Sorry uncle sorry.

1392
01:24:49,683 --> 01:24:52,311
You are stopping us
from entertaining ourselves.

1393
01:24:52,653 --> 01:24:53,745
Is it already midnight for you?

1394
01:24:53,787 --> 01:24:56,756
Hey don't talk of midnight.

1395
01:24:56,790 --> 01:25:00,089
No one can do anything
to us we do it to others.

1396
01:25:00,694 --> 01:25:01,683
Look at the sardar.

1397
01:25:01,862 --> 01:25:04,194
He is denying it and saying it himself.

1398
01:25:05,332 --> 01:25:07,857
Hey! - Hey! - Hey!

1399
01:25:08,102 --> 01:25:09,000
Hey!

1400
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:12,063
Who is it?

1401
01:25:12,606 --> 01:25:17,669
Father he was talking about
midnight and he is not even leaving me.

1402
01:25:19,113 --> 01:25:21,104
Leave the boy or you'll be slapped.

1403
01:25:21,148 --> 01:25:26,609
Hey! Shall we catch you then? Huh?

1404
01:25:27,087 --> 01:25:30,113
Why? He is a strong man.

1405
01:25:30,891 --> 01:25:33,985
His one slap and you'll be dead.

1406
01:25:42,002 --> 01:25:43,128
Mr. Captain!

1407
01:25:50,044 --> 01:25:51,306
Mr. Captain, the scoundrels have..

1408
01:25:54,815 --> 01:25:56,146
This fat one.

1409
01:26:22,776 --> 01:26:24,209
98.

1410
01:26:26,247 --> 01:26:27,874
Hey you!

1411
01:26:52,072 --> 01:26:53,664
This scoundrel!

1412
01:27:17,231 --> 01:27:18,198
Aloo paratha.

1413
01:27:18,232 --> 01:27:19,699
Makki ki Roti. Sarson da Saag.

1414
01:27:19,733 --> 01:27:20,757
Lassi. Cooler. Maggi.

1415
01:27:20,801 --> 01:27:22,268
Rope bed. Clarified butter. Butter.

1416
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:23,736
Santa Singh. Banta Singh.

1417
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:28,671
99.

1418
01:27:37,618 --> 01:27:41,213
Whoever utters this
phrase shall be fulfilled.

1419
01:27:41,255 --> 01:27:44,088
Eternal is the holy timeless God.

1420
01:27:52,299 --> 01:27:53,664
Take flowers.

1421
01:27:53,701 --> 01:27:55,828
Clarified butter. Mother's milk.

1422
01:27:55,869 --> 01:27:57,996
It's over.

1423
01:27:58,105 --> 01:28:00,005
There's been a robbery.

1424
01:28:00,107 --> 01:28:02,905
They've disrespected me.

1425
01:28:03,010 --> 01:28:05,069
It's on me. They've disrespected me.

1426
01:28:05,112 --> 01:28:07,046
It's on me.

1427
01:28:23,097 --> 01:28:24,189
Please forgive us.

1428
01:28:24,231 --> 01:28:26,631
We are just joking.

1429
01:28:26,667 --> 01:28:28,066
Oh no!

1430
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:29,160
I'm done.

1431
01:28:29,269 --> 01:28:32,568
I'm done. They disrespected..

1432
01:28:41,014 --> 01:28:43,209
Now say whose midnight is it?

1433
01:28:44,618 --> 01:28:45,983
Ours.

1434
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:48,182
Leave us.

1435
01:28:48,956 --> 01:28:50,617
Why are you disrespecting us?

1436
01:28:50,657 --> 01:28:52,852
Father, they've agreed.

1437
01:28:52,993 --> 01:28:55,962
Yes, so let's allow them to go. - Okay.

1438
01:28:56,563 --> 01:28:57,655
Just a minute brother.

1439
01:28:58,098 --> 01:28:59,087
Where is Lavina?

1440
01:29:01,668 --> 01:29:05,604
Sardar, they've
kidnapped Lavina, my friend.

1441
01:29:05,672 --> 01:29:06,764
Where is she?

1442
01:29:07,708 --> 01:29:09,073
She is in the car.

1443
01:29:09,276 --> 01:29:10,675
Take her.

1444
01:29:11,145 --> 01:29:12,271
You too go.

1445
01:29:15,682 --> 01:29:16,842
Lavina.

1446
01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:18,278
Oh shit!

1447
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:20,880
What have these scoundrels done?

1448
01:29:21,989 --> 01:29:23,820
Sprinkle water on her face. - Yes.

1449
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:27,727
Lavina, are you okay?

1450
01:29:28,061 --> 01:29:29,028
You okay?

1451
01:29:29,129 --> 01:29:29,993
You okay?

1452
01:29:32,199 --> 01:29:33,860
Lokesh.

1453
01:29:42,676 --> 01:29:43,768
Quiet.

1454
01:29:44,912 --> 01:29:46,880
Come. Come.

1455
01:29:50,717 --> 01:29:51,775
Come.

1456
01:29:55,756 --> 01:29:57,587
Thank you, sardar.

1457
01:29:57,858 --> 01:29:59,723
Can I get a shawl for the girl?

1458
01:29:59,893 --> 01:30:01,986
I'll kill you. - Enough!

1459
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:02,893
You bloody dogs.

1460
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:04,591
Enough! Enough!

1461
01:30:04,798 --> 01:30:06,561
Leave us to do the
work of thrashing them.

1462
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:09,965
Brother, take them to
your sister-in-law. - Okay.

1463
01:30:10,637 --> 01:30:12,195
Come, come. Come.

1464
01:30:13,273 --> 01:30:14,570
You!

1465
01:30:15,008 --> 01:30:16,134
Wait brothers.

1466
01:30:16,944 --> 01:30:20,107
I've a better idea of
dealing with them than thrashing them.

1467
01:30:20,347 --> 01:30:22,076
Idea. What idea?

1468
01:30:37,297 --> 01:30:39,288
We were badly insulted today.

1469
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,391
I'm worrying about him.

1470
01:30:43,136 --> 01:30:44,933
He has gone into coma.

1471
01:30:45,706 --> 01:30:46,866
Mr. Captain.

1472
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:50,372
Mr. Captain.

1473
01:30:52,312 --> 01:30:53,404
Mr. Captain.

1474
01:31:03,156 --> 01:31:06,751
Brother, I desperately
feel like spitting on their face.

1475
01:31:07,594 --> 01:31:09,027
Why do you want to
spit? Pee on their face.

1476
01:31:09,129 --> 01:31:10,255
How does it matter to me?

1477
01:31:12,099 --> 01:31:13,566
Come on uncle.

1478
01:31:14,334 --> 01:31:15,767
Come on look in front.

1479
01:31:15,802 --> 01:31:16,791
Don't look back.

1480
01:31:16,937 --> 01:31:17,926
It's a surprise.

1481
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:23,166
Is it feeling hot or not?

1482
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:26,769
It's perfect. Keep going.

1483
01:31:26,813 --> 01:31:27,837
His mileage is good.

1484
01:31:28,582 --> 01:31:31,779
This should be done to
anyone who molests women.

1485
01:31:34,354 --> 01:31:35,912
It shouldn't have ended.

1486
01:31:35,956 --> 01:31:37,583
Great! Keep going, keep going.

1487
01:31:37,791 --> 01:31:39,349
This is pee of revenge.

1488
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,250
It won't finish so soon.

1489
01:31:41,395 --> 01:31:44,193
Father, I want to go to latrine.

1490
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:50,001
Thank god he didn't do it.

1491
01:31:50,604 --> 01:31:53,129
Peeing makes no sense.

1492
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:56,538
And especially on his birthday.

1493
01:31:56,843 --> 01:32:01,837
I say that next time we'll
celebrate Mr. Captain's birthday at home.

1494
01:32:05,919 --> 01:32:10,151
Mr. Captain, shall we
stop somewhere and take bath?

1495
01:32:12,926 --> 01:32:16,123
I'll take bath with that boy's blood.

1496
01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:20,795
Turn the car Choudhury.

1497
01:32:21,168 --> 01:32:22,726
Turn the car. Turn!

1498
01:32:32,112 --> 01:32:35,172
We have no value after marriage.

1499
01:32:35,215 --> 01:32:37,945
We are your slaves, girls.

1500
01:32:37,985 --> 01:32:39,179
Well said brother.

1501
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:40,846
Just let it be.

1502
01:32:40,887 --> 01:32:43,378
You don't even take me
for movies. Yes. - She is right.

1503
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:45,080
I showed you a film yesterday, Dabanng.

1504
01:32:45,125 --> 01:32:49,084
Then? - Really? On Star Gold at home.

1505
01:32:51,965 --> 01:32:52,795
Forget it.

1506
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:54,300
They need just two things.

1507
01:32:54,368 --> 01:32:55,801
Alcohol and chicken. - Yes.

1508
01:32:55,836 --> 01:32:56,803
Everything ends there.

1509
01:32:57,170 --> 01:33:00,901
Oh! You look so beautiful.

1510
01:33:00,941 --> 01:33:02,340
Isn't it? - Yes, true.

1511
01:33:03,343 --> 01:33:05,004
But why are you so sad?

1512
01:33:05,779 --> 01:33:07,576
Your hero has saved you.

1513
01:33:08,248 --> 01:33:10,239
Yes Manjeet was telling us.

1514
01:33:10,617 --> 01:33:14,053
He came running for
5 kilometers to save you.

1515
01:33:14,187 --> 01:33:16,781
The boy has been
clean bowled in your love.

1516
01:33:16,823 --> 01:33:18,347
I really adore it.

1517
01:33:19,726 --> 01:33:22,286
No, no, there is
nothing like that between us.

1518
01:33:22,663 --> 01:33:23,857
Really?

1519
01:33:24,197 --> 01:33:28,031
If there is nothing
like that then it'll happen.

1520
01:33:29,236 --> 01:33:31,033
Come on wear this.

1521
01:33:34,074 --> 01:33:36,201
It'll shine bright.

1522
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:40,637
You know how to
convince others. - Let it be.

1523
01:33:40,681 --> 01:33:42,376
Look, this is what is going to
happen in future with you. - Yes.

1524
01:33:42,582 --> 01:33:44,846
Wow! Great! The
party has become interesting.

1525
01:33:45,052 --> 01:33:47,577
Parminder's dress
looks good on you, Lokesh.

1526
01:33:47,621 --> 01:33:49,054
Thank you. - It has fit you well.

1527
01:33:49,089 --> 01:33:50,181
The boy is handsome.

1528
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:51,648
Where is Lavina?

1529
01:33:53,126 --> 01:33:54,184
Sister-in-law, where is Lavina?

1530
01:33:54,728 --> 01:33:56,855
Look, here is Lavina.

1531
01:34:05,672 --> 01:34:07,867
Sit down friend, sit down.

1532
01:34:08,675 --> 01:34:10,199
Lavina come here.

1533
01:34:10,677 --> 01:34:12,235
Listen to what these guys are telling.

1534
01:34:12,312 --> 01:34:13,904
They must be talking nonsense.

1535
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:20,652
Okay? - Yes sir.

1536
01:34:20,687 --> 01:34:22,177
Rawat, turn on the tape.

1537
01:34:22,322 --> 01:34:23,220
Yes sir.

1538
01:34:23,890 --> 01:34:26,586
You both always
leave your work incomplete.

1539
01:34:26,626 --> 01:34:28,218
Go and catch the girl and the boy.

1540
01:34:28,628 --> 01:34:31,859
Sir, what shall we do about the
people from Adarsh Bharat Yuva Dal?

1541
01:34:32,733 --> 01:34:35,930
They are patriots
we'll sacrifice their lives.

1542
01:34:39,639 --> 01:34:40,867
Come on, come on, start it Rawat.

1543
01:34:40,907 --> 01:34:41,839
Start it.

1544
01:34:57,924 --> 01:35:00,290
Forward it. The sting
operation must be ahead.

1545
01:35:24,251 --> 01:35:25,309
Stop it!

1546
01:35:27,053 --> 01:35:30,853
My grandma used to say
that drinking it is useful.

1547
01:35:31,925 --> 01:35:32,914
Cow's.

1548
01:35:34,094 --> 01:35:35,026
Move aside.

1549
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:44,559
Sir, I feel that you've digested it.

1550
01:35:55,649 --> 01:35:57,913
Kill that boy.

1551
01:35:58,118 --> 01:36:00,882
Take the tape and cut him into pieces.

1552
01:36:01,121 --> 01:36:03,783
Sisodiya, if he remains
alive you won't be spared.

1553
01:36:03,824 --> 01:36:05,223
Understood? Go!

1554
01:36:06,526 --> 01:36:07,515
Shall I go with him, sir?

1555
01:36:07,627 --> 01:36:13,691
All of you go but listen to cut
off his penis before chopping him.

1556
01:36:13,934 --> 01:36:16,061
Now go. Go!

1557
01:36:21,241 --> 01:36:22,208
Did you connect to that boy's number?

1558
01:36:22,242 --> 01:36:23,334
No, it's switched off.

1559
01:36:23,777 --> 01:36:24,937
Scoundrel.

1560
01:36:27,214 --> 01:36:28,181
Be careful.

1561
01:36:31,318 --> 01:36:32,546
Come.

1562
01:36:32,652 --> 01:36:33,619
Leave me.

1563
01:36:34,354 --> 01:36:36,879
Sir. Sir.

1564
01:36:36,990 --> 01:36:38,184
Meet us outside the
station in ten minutes.

1565
01:36:38,325 --> 01:36:39,587
We need to catch that guy again.

1566
01:36:39,659 --> 01:36:41,320
What? - He gave us the wrong tape.

1567
01:36:45,065 --> 01:36:47,158
He is a tough nut.

1568
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:53,364
You girls don't value the guys. - Yes.

1569
01:36:54,007 --> 01:36:57,875
Talk of something
which we should value. - Yes.

1570
01:36:57,978 --> 01:37:01,038
Really? - There is nothing they can do.

1571
01:37:01,214 --> 01:37:02,681
Come on girls
we've seen them let's move.

1572
01:37:02,716 --> 01:37:04,274
They can do nothing. Let's get up.

1573
01:37:04,317 --> 01:37:05,841
Come on, let's go, let's go.

1574
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:32,184
Dhondiyal.

1575
01:40:32,325 --> 01:40:33,917
Put on the speaker. Speaker.

1576
01:40:35,595 --> 01:40:36,755
Hello!

1577
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:37,956
Where are you?

1578
01:40:39,632 --> 01:40:40,792
Why have you called?

1579
01:40:40,934 --> 01:40:43,903
Because you are helping
that boy instead of helping..

1580
01:40:44,104 --> 01:40:45,366
..the country and the government.

1581
01:40:45,605 --> 01:40:48,130
We know that the boy is with you.

1582
01:40:48,208 --> 01:40:49,334
Is he with you or not?

1583
01:40:49,809 --> 01:40:51,276
You've got your tape, right?

1584
01:40:51,344 --> 01:40:52,743
Now what do you want from him?

1585
01:40:52,812 --> 01:40:55,406
Hey you, don't act
too smart the two of you.

1586
01:40:55,615 --> 01:40:58,106
The boy had brought his
doom by giving the wrong tape.

1587
01:40:58,618 --> 01:41:00,848
Hey, what do you mean by wrong tape?

1588
01:41:01,087 --> 01:41:02,611
Have I opened up a library?

1589
01:41:02,822 --> 01:41:04,050
I had only one tape with me.

1590
01:41:04,124 --> 01:41:07,821
Hey you hero finally you spoke
up, you are trying to act too smart.

1591
01:41:08,194 --> 01:41:11,357
We've seen with our own
eyes that Pandit had put..

1592
01:41:11,598 --> 01:41:13,964
..the tape inside your
jacket's pocket in the hotel's lobby.

1593
01:41:14,033 --> 01:41:15,898
And you've handed us this tape?

1594
01:41:16,302 --> 01:41:18,270
You wanted to make
the minister drink urine.

1595
01:41:18,705 --> 01:41:20,730
He has asked to break your neck.

1596
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:26,270
Sir, he disconnected the phone.

1597
01:41:26,913 --> 01:41:28,574
Have you traced the call?

1598
01:41:28,648 --> 01:41:30,775
Yes sir. They are on Gurudwara road.

1599
01:41:32,218 --> 01:41:33,310
Come on.

1600
01:41:33,386 --> 01:41:35,217
Which tape are they talking about now?

1601
01:41:35,822 --> 01:41:39,280
Who is this Pandit who
kept the tape in my waist coat?

1602
01:41:40,293 --> 01:41:41,885
I cannot understand.

1603
01:41:43,396 --> 01:41:44,727
Hey stop!

1604
01:41:44,797 --> 01:41:46,628
Hey what are you
doing? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1605
01:41:46,699 --> 01:41:47,961
Does anyone do such things?

1606
01:41:50,236 --> 01:41:51,294
Oh no!

1607
01:41:51,371 --> 01:41:52,861
What happened?

1608
01:41:52,939 --> 01:41:54,236
My waistcoat.

1609
01:41:54,874 --> 01:41:56,671
If the tape is there
it'll be in my waist coat.

1610
01:41:57,210 --> 01:41:58,609
In that farm house.

1611
01:41:59,145 --> 01:42:00,874
But how shall we go there at this hour?

1612
01:42:02,782 --> 01:42:04,181
No, my son, don't walk to that place.

1613
01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:06,250
It's not safe. The girl is with you.

1614
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:09,779
Parminder! Bring the car keys, my son.

1615
01:42:55,368 --> 01:42:56,995
They all are dead drunk.

1616
01:42:57,070 --> 01:42:58,128
Come on Lokesh.

1617
01:42:58,204 --> 01:42:59,535
Come. - Come, come.

1618
01:42:59,606 --> 01:43:01,767
This was the room.
It'll be somewhere here.

1619
01:43:02,942 --> 01:43:04,204
I've got it. - What's this?

1620
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:09,873
Oh no! Adarsh Bharat Yuva Dal.

1621
01:43:10,283 --> 01:43:12,342
But we must first see
what's there in this tape.

1622
01:43:12,585 --> 01:43:13,950
Yes, let's go.

1623
01:43:16,723 --> 01:43:18,054
Come, come. Here is one.

1624
01:43:24,998 --> 01:43:26,590
What's there in this bloody tape?

1625
01:43:29,035 --> 01:43:30,332
Look, it's very simple.

1626
01:43:30,570 --> 01:43:35,667
In order to stop our government
from dissolving we need six members.

1627
01:43:36,376 --> 01:43:38,276
Two from you and four from you.

1628
01:43:38,344 --> 01:43:41,245
But Mr. Acharya,
everyone's asking money in advance.

1629
01:43:41,314 --> 01:43:44,943
Look, we are taking more
time to bring the 400 crores..

1630
01:43:45,018 --> 01:43:47,043
..then we took to earn it.

1631
01:43:47,186 --> 01:43:51,680
Look, you know that it takes
long to bring money from Swiss bank.

1632
01:43:51,958 --> 01:43:53,653
Mr. Pandit, am I
right? - Yes, absolutely.

1633
01:43:54,794 --> 01:43:59,128
Look, you'll get 15
crores each by tomorrow evening.

1634
01:44:01,868 --> 01:44:03,893
It's Gandhi's birth
anniversary on 2nd October and..

1635
01:44:03,970 --> 01:44:05,699
..there'll be bundles
of currency in your homes.

1636
01:44:07,307 --> 01:44:08,569
Oh shit!

1637
01:44:08,741 --> 01:44:12,142
Yes, my friends from the
media I have two work with you.

1638
01:44:12,211 --> 01:44:15,009
One the Swamiji from
Adarsh Bharat has started..

1639
01:44:15,214 --> 01:44:17,341
..fasting against us.

1640
01:44:17,684 --> 01:44:19,174
He is trying to prove
himself as a big patriot.

1641
01:44:19,252 --> 01:44:20,810
Mr. Pandit. - Yes. - Come here.

1642
01:44:21,688 --> 01:44:24,054
Keep the bag there and you come here.

1643
01:44:24,123 --> 01:44:26,023
Meet him.

1644
01:44:26,092 --> 01:44:28,754
He is Devraj Pandit.

1645
01:44:29,128 --> 01:44:34,657
He is the right hand of the
Swami but he is joined to our body.

1646
01:44:35,868 --> 01:44:41,135
Secondly,unfortunately lot
of my scams is being revealed.

1647
01:44:41,207 --> 01:44:43,698
Show less of them. Try to
divert the attention of the public.

1648
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:45,300
Mr. Acharya, what can we do?

1649
01:44:45,378 --> 01:44:48,370
Your party members are accused
even in the scam of Jansayog report.

1650
01:44:48,715 --> 01:44:50,080
We need to show them.

1651
01:44:50,149 --> 01:44:52,242
You need big news then tell me.

1652
01:44:52,318 --> 01:44:54,786
We'll arrange a blast in
Jantar Mantar. 10-15 people will die.

1653
01:44:54,854 --> 01:44:56,719
It'll be sufficient
news for one week. Show it.

1654
01:44:56,789 --> 01:44:58,620
What do you say Mr.
Pandit? - Yes, absolutely.

1655
01:44:58,691 --> 01:44:59,885
Oh my!

1656
01:44:59,959 --> 01:45:03,725
15 crores will reach
your home by tomorrow evening.

1657
01:45:03,796 --> 01:45:04,990
Sisodiya. - Yes sir.

1658
01:45:05,064 --> 01:45:06,156
Oh my god!

1659
01:45:06,899 --> 01:45:09,163
Holy shit man!

1660
01:45:12,705 --> 01:45:15,003
Move from in front of me.

1661
01:45:15,174 --> 01:45:16,937
Give me that tape. - Tape, tape.

1662
01:45:18,010 --> 01:45:19,238
Come on Lavina, let's go.

1663
01:45:22,315 --> 01:45:23,873
That's some amazing stuff man.

1664
01:45:23,950 --> 01:45:25,178
I want the tape.

1665
01:45:26,853 --> 01:45:28,013
Okay, okay.

1666
01:45:33,893 --> 01:45:34,951
Shit!

1667
01:45:35,228 --> 01:45:36,718
Lavina, come, come.

1668
01:45:43,669 --> 01:45:44,829
What happened?

1669
01:45:45,838 --> 01:45:46,930
Sit down all of you.

1670
01:45:47,106 --> 01:45:48,266
Why are you standing?

1671
01:45:50,743 --> 01:45:52,643
Because Katta is standing.

1672
01:45:53,146 --> 01:45:55,614
And he has decided to take you to task.

1673
01:45:56,015 --> 01:45:57,778
Do we smell?

1674
01:45:58,251 --> 01:46:00,116
No, not at all.

1675
01:46:00,186 --> 01:46:01,949
Smell, smell us you scoundrel.

1676
01:46:02,155 --> 01:46:03,622
Do we smell or not?

1677
01:46:04,223 --> 01:46:05,918
It smells, it smells very bad.

1678
01:46:05,992 --> 01:46:08,290
You'll smell more than us.

1679
01:46:08,528 --> 01:46:10,894
A mixture of all of us. - Cocktail.

1680
01:46:10,963 --> 01:46:13,056
Undress yourself. - What?

1681
01:46:13,566 --> 01:46:15,796
Undress yourself. - Open.

1682
01:46:16,536 --> 01:46:18,003
Hey you!

1683
01:46:18,070 --> 01:46:23,633
I never undressed myself so
many times as I did in this one night.

1684
01:46:32,685 --> 01:46:33,743
Remove your hands.

1685
01:46:34,654 --> 01:46:35,814
A buffalo in your shorts.

1686
01:46:36,155 --> 01:46:37,622
Doesn't it strike?

1687
01:46:37,957 --> 01:46:39,822
It isn't a buffalo.

1688
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:41,991
It is a bull.

1689
01:46:42,061 --> 01:46:45,030
Bull. Turn, turn, let's see its tail.

1690
01:46:46,566 --> 01:46:48,158
He is a free bull.

1691
01:46:48,634 --> 01:46:51,603
Today we'll tie a
string to the bull's tail.

1692
01:46:51,671 --> 01:46:52,831
What do you say Mr. Captain?

1693
01:46:54,207 --> 01:46:56,198
Drop your underpants.

1694
01:46:58,744 --> 01:47:00,211
No one will move from here.

1695
01:47:03,616 --> 01:47:06,278
Everyone should
watch him being disgraced.

1696
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:09,649
Please forgive me Mr. Captain.

1697
01:47:10,523 --> 01:47:11,888
I'm your younger brother.

1698
01:47:11,958 --> 01:47:14,051
I got swayed in the
company of the sardars. - Shut up!

1699
01:47:16,529 --> 01:47:18,690
Drop your underpants.

1700
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,158
Drop your gun.

1701
01:47:24,837 --> 01:47:26,134
What's happening here?

1702
01:47:27,106 --> 01:47:28,664
Is a shooting going on?

1703
01:47:28,941 --> 01:47:30,738
Come on, get going from here.

1704
01:47:32,745 --> 01:47:37,045
Phantom have you
plugged your ears? Drop your gun.

1705
01:47:37,850 --> 01:47:39,181
What if I don't drop it?

1706
01:47:39,652 --> 01:47:42,678
Then I'll shoot your head
and make a lampshade out of it.

1707
01:47:42,755 --> 01:47:44,279
You'll keep emitting light.

1708
01:47:48,661 --> 01:47:50,856
Century brother! Century!

1709
01:48:07,079 --> 01:48:08,910
Mr. Captain!

1710
01:48:09,715 --> 01:48:13,242
You scoundrel, rascal, your mother's..

1711
01:48:14,787 --> 01:48:16,687
What? What were you
saying, sir's mother's?

1712
01:48:16,756 --> 01:48:18,053
Huh? Speak up.

1713
01:48:18,124 --> 01:48:20,991
What were you saying, sir's
mother's? - Blessings, blessings sir.

1714
01:48:21,661 --> 01:48:24,630
If you have any problems then tell me.

1715
01:48:28,134 --> 01:48:29,897
Sir, sir, he just moved.

1716
01:48:33,606 --> 01:48:36,302
When a Jat dies know that..

1717
01:48:37,043 --> 01:48:39,102
..you are done.

1718
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:51,720
When a Jat dies know that..

1719
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:04,033
When a Jat dies know that..

1720
01:49:04,103 --> 01:49:07,561
..you are done.

1721
01:49:18,050 --> 01:49:20,712
Come on baby. - That tape, damn it!

1722
01:49:20,786 --> 01:49:22,253
Please baby, come on.

1723
01:49:22,321 --> 01:49:23,948
What is this baby? Come.

1724
01:49:24,023 --> 01:49:25,581
Sleep baby. - Come.

1725
01:49:25,891 --> 01:49:29,088
Okay baby. I'm coming, huh.

1726
01:49:31,597 --> 01:49:34,930
Yes hero, where is your madam?

1727
01:49:36,202 --> 01:49:37,669
She..

1728
01:49:38,571 --> 01:49:42,098
Madam! Oh madam!

1729
01:49:42,174 --> 01:49:44,904
Bring your sexy self here.

1730
01:49:46,212 --> 01:49:49,978
Come, come.

1731
01:49:52,051 --> 01:49:54,747
Before we carry out the
funeral of your lover we..

1732
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:59,154
..thought of thanking
you for calling us here.

1733
01:50:02,561 --> 01:50:05,086
Mr. Captain, I got swayed
in the company of the sardars.

1734
01:50:05,264 --> 01:50:06,959
Drop your underpants.

1735
01:50:07,333 --> 01:50:09,733
I saw that the Jats had..

1736
01:50:11,270 --> 01:50:13,101
Hello Delhi Police control room.

1737
01:50:13,239 --> 01:50:14,729
Who is towards Chattrapur?

1738
01:50:14,807 --> 01:50:16,138
Who is towards Chattrapur?

1739
01:50:16,208 --> 01:50:19,939
Some Lavina and Lokesh
Duggal's life is in danger.

1740
01:50:20,012 --> 01:50:21,309
Is there any unit nearby?

1741
01:50:21,380 --> 01:50:23,280
Come in 216, come in 216.

1742
01:50:23,349 --> 01:50:25,681
I'm in Chattrapur, I'm going there.

1743
01:50:26,986 --> 01:50:29,045
Bhusan Dhondiyal is my name.

1744
01:50:29,388 --> 01:50:32,357
I take out melting needle from fire.

1745
01:50:32,591 --> 01:50:33,819
What do you say sir?

1746
01:50:33,993 --> 01:50:35,153
Take u-turn.

1747
01:50:38,597 --> 01:50:40,792
The public is in
trouble and I won't come?

1748
01:50:41,367 --> 01:50:43,062
How is that possible?

1749
01:50:43,736 --> 01:50:47,172
I had called 100 to
save you from the Jats.

1750
01:50:47,873 --> 01:50:49,864
I didn't know that
these rascals will come.

1751
01:50:49,942 --> 01:50:52,934
Even our mothers didn't
know that we'll be scoundrels.

1752
01:50:55,147 --> 01:50:57,047
You've worn a nice pair of underpants.

1753
01:51:00,019 --> 01:51:01,179
Thank you sir.

1754
01:51:01,787 --> 01:51:02,913
Come on take it out.

1755
01:51:03,155 --> 01:51:05,180
Sir please sir, even you too.

1756
01:51:05,357 --> 01:51:07,621
This is against law. My underpants.

1757
01:51:07,693 --> 01:51:09,160
Take out the tape, you scoundrel.

1758
01:51:09,228 --> 01:51:10,559
Tape?

1759
01:51:11,564 --> 01:51:13,691
Sir, tape is not with me.

1760
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,058
If you say this again then..

1761
01:51:16,135 --> 01:51:19,730
Sir, sir, sir, the
tape is with them sir.

1762
01:51:19,905 --> 01:51:22,806
What? He is lying, sir. - Yes.

1763
01:51:22,875 --> 01:51:25,070
He is lying, sir. He is clearly lying.

1764
01:51:25,778 --> 01:51:27,973
Do I appear to be
in the position to lie?

1765
01:51:29,148 --> 01:51:33,050
The tape was hidden in my
clothes and they snatched away my clothes.

1766
01:51:33,619 --> 01:51:35,211
Undress yourselves. - Sir. - Undress!

1767
01:51:35,287 --> 01:51:37,585
Undress! - Okay sir.

1768
01:51:53,172 --> 01:51:54,730
There is nothing in it.

1769
01:51:54,940 --> 01:51:56,601
Come on get down.

1770
01:51:56,675 --> 01:51:57,972
Sir, what are you doing? - Sir..

1771
01:51:58,043 --> 01:51:59,772
I'll search everything inside. - Okay.

1772
01:52:01,714 --> 01:52:02,840
Hey!

1773
01:52:05,851 --> 01:52:07,148
Sir, I don't know why they..

1774
01:52:11,123 --> 01:52:12,249
Oh no!

1775
01:52:14,059 --> 01:52:16,721
Come on, tell where the tape is?

1776
01:52:17,296 --> 01:52:20,197
Else the next bullet
will be aimed at her head.

1777
01:52:20,266 --> 01:52:25,670
Sir, please sir, I'll give you the tape.

1778
01:52:27,373 --> 01:52:29,204
Please leave her.

1779
01:52:29,275 --> 01:52:31,743
Just look at the
love this guy has for her.

1780
01:52:31,811 --> 01:52:34,211
I can become a girl to get your love.

1781
01:52:34,814 --> 01:52:36,839
Look, I've left her.

1782
01:52:36,916 --> 01:52:38,247
Now take it out.

1783
01:52:39,752 --> 01:52:41,117
Sir.

1784
01:52:47,026 --> 01:52:48,823
You are a rascal.

1785
01:52:49,361 --> 01:52:53,957
Strange, the work that the
bullet couldn't do was done by this girl.

1786
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:57,164
Come on, give the tape.

1787
01:53:03,642 --> 01:53:06,634
Not there, here.

1788
01:53:08,981 --> 01:53:11,006
Have you come for a
wedding party that you want tape?

1789
01:53:11,083 --> 01:53:13,313
What? Hey you boy give the tape here.

1790
01:53:14,620 --> 01:53:17,282
Hey, does the tape
belong to your father? Say.

1791
01:53:19,758 --> 01:53:21,692
Then is it your father's?

1792
01:53:22,094 --> 01:53:24,028
Come on your game is over.

1793
01:53:24,296 --> 01:53:25,854
Hey you boy give the tape to sir.

1794
01:53:26,198 --> 01:53:28,359
How come you all have come here to die?

1795
01:53:29,768 --> 01:53:31,201
I have called them. - Quereshi.

1796
01:53:31,270 --> 01:53:32,999
Not to die but to kill.

1797
01:53:33,706 --> 01:53:36,072
I can find out even the
melting needle inside fire.

1798
01:53:37,376 --> 01:53:38,741
What do you say sir?

1799
01:53:39,578 --> 01:53:40,704
Take u-turn.

1800
01:53:43,782 --> 01:53:44,908
Quereshi!

1801
01:53:46,619 --> 01:53:49,019
You betrayer.

1802
01:53:49,088 --> 01:53:50,783
Your sins had multiplied.

1803
01:53:50,956 --> 01:53:52,617
The time to stop it had come.

1804
01:53:55,728 --> 01:54:00,097
I'll destroy all of you
if you don't drop the gun.

1805
01:54:00,633 --> 01:54:02,123
What's going on?

1806
01:54:02,534 --> 01:54:04,559
Dhondiyal. - Sir.

1807
01:54:04,770 --> 01:54:05,930
Who has the power now?

1808
01:54:06,005 --> 01:54:12,205
I'm your wife's lover and
my name is Sarfarosh Choudhury.

1809
01:54:12,611 --> 01:54:15,136
This is not a caste war.

1810
01:54:15,648 --> 01:54:17,275
What do you want?

1811
01:54:17,349 --> 01:54:23,652
Give that boy and this
inspector to us. That's all.

1812
01:54:23,856 --> 01:54:25,824
We don't want anything else.

1813
01:54:26,191 --> 01:54:30,753
Look, you can take the
boy after we are done with him.

1814
01:54:31,163 --> 01:54:33,688
But the one whom you
are abusing is our sir.

1815
01:54:33,933 --> 01:54:35,594
We cannot give him to you.

1816
01:54:35,668 --> 01:54:39,764
Then even Lord
Hanuman can't save your sir.

1817
01:54:42,007 --> 01:54:43,872
Nunna!

1818
01:54:43,943 --> 01:54:45,740
Nunna!

1819
01:54:45,778 --> 01:54:48,178
Nunna!

1820
01:55:57,116 --> 01:55:58,208
Lokesh!

1821
01:56:05,758 --> 01:56:07,157
Lokesh, wait there.

1822
01:56:07,793 --> 01:56:08,953
Let's go. Let's go.

1823
01:56:09,028 --> 01:56:10,791
Lokesh! Lokesh, listen to me.

1824
01:56:13,198 --> 01:56:14,893
Lokesh, where are you all going?

1825
01:56:16,568 --> 01:56:17,660
Lokesh!

1826
01:56:17,736 --> 01:56:18,862
Come on.

1827
01:56:18,937 --> 01:56:20,734
Run! Come on, come on.

1828
01:56:20,806 --> 01:56:22,899
Hold on. Yes, let's go, let's go.

1829
01:56:22,975 --> 01:56:24,272
Lokesh, you boy.

1830
01:56:24,343 --> 01:56:25,640
Listent o me.

1831
01:56:27,913 --> 01:56:29,676
Dad, I need to get that tape.

1832
01:56:29,715 --> 01:56:30,909
I'm locked in here.

1833
01:56:30,983 --> 01:56:33,781
The other key is kept on
the window sill in bathroom.

1834
01:56:33,852 --> 01:56:38,687
Listen, Manohar Acharya is
the same guy who had labeled..

1835
01:56:38,757 --> 01:56:41,624
..true charges of
corruption against your father.

1836
01:56:41,827 --> 01:56:45,228
We won't get a better chance to
overturn the government than this one.

1837
01:56:46,131 --> 01:56:48,326
Therefore listen to me carefully.

1838
01:56:48,567 --> 01:56:50,125
Come on, come on, fast.

1839
01:56:50,636 --> 01:56:52,194
Lokesh! Listen, listen to me.

1840
01:56:52,271 --> 01:56:53,795
Hey listen.

1841
01:56:54,339 --> 01:56:55,931
Hey, where are you going?

1842
01:56:56,308 --> 01:56:57,570
Lokesh, stop.

1843
01:56:59,845 --> 01:57:01,176
Lokesh, what are you doing?

1844
01:57:02,514 --> 01:57:03,640
Just a minute.

1845
01:57:05,584 --> 01:57:06,949
Hey!

1846
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:09,148
Hey Lokesh!

1847
01:57:09,888 --> 01:57:11,753
Open the door.
Lokesh, what are you doing?

1848
01:57:11,824 --> 01:57:13,018
Lokesh! - Oh no! - Listen.

1849
01:57:13,092 --> 01:57:14,218
Stop! Hey!

1850
01:57:15,094 --> 01:57:17,221
Listen! Lokesh listen o me.

1851
01:57:17,563 --> 01:57:18,655
Stop!

1852
01:57:19,965 --> 01:57:21,159
Open the door.

1853
01:57:21,233 --> 01:57:22,564
Lokesh!

1854
01:57:25,137 --> 01:57:26,195
Look I won't do anything.

1855
01:57:26,271 --> 01:57:27,795
Stop, listen to me.

1856
01:57:28,006 --> 01:57:30,099
Lokesh! Lokesh, stop.

1857
01:57:31,310 --> 01:57:32,800
Lokesh, open the door.

1858
01:57:32,878 --> 01:57:34,038
Lokesh!

1859
01:57:34,246 --> 01:57:35,235
Listen to me. - Lokesh!

1860
01:57:35,314 --> 01:57:36,542
Open the door.

1861
01:57:41,353 --> 01:57:42,650
Lokesh!

1862
01:57:42,721 --> 01:57:44,746
Lokesh! Listen! - Listen to me.

1863
01:57:46,658 --> 01:57:48,558
Lokesh, Lokesh, what are you doing?

1864
01:57:49,094 --> 01:57:50,186
Open the door, give me the tape.

1865
01:57:50,262 --> 01:57:52,162
No Lokesh, don't give
the tape to this scoundrel.

1866
01:57:52,364 --> 01:57:54,298
All the policemen are
puppets in the hands of the minister.

1867
01:57:54,366 --> 01:57:56,800
This tape must reach the common man.

1868
01:57:57,636 --> 01:57:58,933
He is right Lokesh.

1869
01:57:59,004 --> 01:58:02,030
The public should know how
corrupt Manohar Acharya is. - Okay.

1870
01:58:02,241 --> 01:58:03,731
What will happen if they come to know?

1871
01:58:04,543 --> 01:58:07,171
Someone else who is
corrupt will come in Acharya's place.

1872
01:58:08,313 --> 01:58:10,110
Just think for yourself Lokesh.

1873
01:58:10,182 --> 01:58:12,150
How much would you've
earned for working in one night?

1874
01:58:12,518 --> 01:58:14,611
500? 800?

1875
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:19,279
Today I'm ready to give
you 50 lakhs for this tape.

1876
01:58:19,525 --> 01:58:20,719
Now tell what you have to say.

1877
01:58:20,893 --> 01:58:22,986
If you work for 17 years
except on Sundays then you'll..

1878
01:58:23,529 --> 01:58:25,258
..be able to earn 50 lakhs.

1879
01:58:26,798 --> 01:58:29,961
Lokesh, give this tape to the
people of Adarsh Bharat Yuva Dal.

1880
01:58:30,035 --> 01:58:32,196
Yes, yes. - Okay.

1881
01:58:32,738 --> 01:58:34,797
Lokesh, what are
you doing? Don't be crazy.

1882
01:58:34,873 --> 01:58:36,773
You won't get such an
opportunity in life again.

1883
01:58:36,842 --> 01:58:38,104
Nothing will change
if you give this tape.

1884
01:58:38,177 --> 01:58:40,111
But 50 lakhs can
change your entire life.

1885
01:58:40,345 --> 01:58:43,007
Shut up! Every man
is not saleable like you.

1886
01:58:44,550 --> 01:58:46,848
Look brother, every man
has a price for his prestige.

1887
01:58:46,919 --> 01:58:48,250
I have one and so do you.

1888
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,753
I don't have one.

1889
01:58:52,591 --> 01:58:53,751
Come on give it to me. - Okay, listen.

1890
01:58:55,694 --> 01:58:58,857
If you feel that 50 lakhs is
a small amount then take 1 crore.

1891
01:58:59,598 --> 01:59:03,227
What do you say? - The
person should quote the right price.

1892
01:59:03,602 --> 01:59:06,230
Else everyone's shop
opens up in some way or the other.

1893
01:59:14,112 --> 01:59:17,673
Okay not 1 crore but 2, 2 crores.

1894
01:59:17,749 --> 01:59:19,842
Cash, right now. Hand to hand.

1895
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:23,586
Tell, tell your price.

1896
01:59:23,655 --> 01:59:25,020
This is the opportunity.

1897
01:59:25,691 --> 01:59:27,556
Okay, okay listen.

1898
01:59:27,626 --> 01:59:28,786
5 crores.

1899
01:59:31,797 --> 01:59:33,059
5 crores.

1900
01:59:33,832 --> 01:59:35,060
10 crores.

1901
01:59:35,267 --> 01:59:36,996
What? - I've decided brother.

1902
01:59:37,169 --> 01:59:39,296
The price of my one night is 10 crores.

1903
01:59:49,014 --> 01:59:50,743
Okay final, 10 crores.

1904
01:59:53,252 --> 01:59:54,617
10.

1905
01:59:54,686 --> 01:59:57,154
Lokesh, don't be foolish.

1906
01:59:57,289 --> 01:59:58,688
Give me the tape.

1907
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:02,691
15.

1908
02:00:04,196 --> 02:00:05,925
I want 15 crores.

1909
02:00:07,566 --> 02:00:08,726
I'll give you brother.

1910
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:11,030
I'll give; I'll
give, right now, in hand.

1911
02:00:11,103 --> 02:00:12,627
What are you saying Lokesh?

1912
02:00:12,704 --> 02:00:13,966
Have you lost it?

1913
02:00:14,039 --> 02:00:15,597
Lavina, 15 crores.

1914
02:00:15,674 --> 02:00:17,073
What can't I do with it?

1915
02:00:17,276 --> 02:00:18,766
My entire life will change.

1916
02:00:19,144 --> 02:00:21,806
Forget your anchoring
we can open an even company.

1917
02:00:22,014 --> 02:00:24,039
Look you.. - Lokesh,
listen to me carefully.

1918
02:00:24,383 --> 02:00:25,748
You are selling off
the rights of a common man..

1919
02:00:25,817 --> 02:00:26,977
..in greed of money.

1920
02:00:27,152 --> 02:00:29,382
Watching this tape and
knowing the truth of the minister is..

1921
02:00:29,621 --> 02:00:31,088
..the right of the common man.

1922
02:00:31,156 --> 02:00:32,885
Which common man?

1923
02:00:33,325 --> 02:00:34,917
Which common man are you talking about?

1924
02:00:34,993 --> 02:00:38,053
One who sells his
vote for a bottle of liquor.

1925
02:00:38,230 --> 02:00:40,721
Or the one who never comes to vote.

1926
02:00:40,799 --> 02:00:42,664
Nothing is going to
improve in this country this way.

1927
02:00:43,402 --> 02:00:45,302
Nothing better can
happen in this country.

1928
02:00:45,904 --> 02:00:49,863
And even if I let go this
opportunity to earn 15 crores for..

1929
02:00:50,008 --> 02:00:52,772
..that common man then
how can you guarantee that..

1930
02:00:52,944 --> 02:00:55,606
..they won't vote Manohar
Acharya again for two bottles of liquor?

1931
02:00:56,281 --> 02:00:58,112
Do you take
guarantee for the common man?

1932
02:00:58,650 --> 02:00:59,878
No, right?

1933
02:00:59,951 --> 02:01:01,213
Look you've stopped talking.

1934
02:01:03,288 --> 02:01:04,585
Great my friend!

1935
02:01:05,090 --> 02:01:06,717
Such an impressive lecture.

1936
02:01:07,225 --> 02:01:09,216
This logic has washed off all my sins.

1937
02:01:09,661 --> 02:01:10,787
Wait.

1938
02:01:12,364 --> 02:01:13,661
Take this.

1939
02:01:13,732 --> 02:01:15,097
The key to your good fortune.

1940
02:01:17,369 --> 02:01:18,927
There is an ambassador car down there.

1941
02:01:19,004 --> 02:01:20,767
There are 5 suitcases in the dickey.

1942
02:01:20,939 --> 02:01:22,236
One is yours.

1943
02:01:22,574 --> 02:01:25,270
Count it and be
satisfied and then give me the tape.

1944
02:01:25,844 --> 02:01:26,936
Okay.

1945
02:01:29,314 --> 02:01:30,747
Come on, go.

1946
02:01:39,157 --> 02:01:42,024
If you open this then
our journey together ends here.

1947
02:02:05,751 --> 02:02:07,048
Yes, keep roaming about.

1948
02:02:07,119 --> 02:02:08,211
Look at Mr. Mehta's son.

1949
02:02:08,286 --> 02:02:09,947
He earns 35,000 per month.

1950
02:02:10,021 --> 02:02:12,888
He has bought a
flat. And look at yourself.

1951
02:02:18,096 --> 02:02:19,927
Brother, Mercedes.

1952
02:02:19,998 --> 02:02:22,228
One day your brother
will buy a car like this one.

1953
02:02:31,743 --> 02:02:35,839
I had never pressurized
my brains in my entire life..

1954
02:02:35,914 --> 02:02:38,109
..the way I had done on that night.

1955
02:02:38,817 --> 02:02:42,116
I was neither swimming nor drowning.

1956
02:02:42,621 --> 02:02:47,752
I didn't know if I was in
water or engulfed in tsunami.

1957
02:02:47,826 --> 02:02:50,090
The common man has
his right on this tape.

1958
02:02:50,162 --> 02:02:53,859
I didn't know what god
can do to a man in one night.

1959
02:02:54,366 --> 02:02:56,061
He can do anything.

1960
02:02:56,835 --> 02:02:59,030
Come on. - Yes, anything.

1961
02:03:52,090 --> 02:03:53,216
Hello!

1962
02:03:53,291 --> 02:03:57,159
In today's breaking news a
tape given by an unknown person has..

1963
02:03:57,229 --> 02:03:59,663
..created a stir
in the political circle.

1964
02:03:59,731 --> 02:04:03,599
With the help of the sting
operation done by Sri Sri Shivanand Swami..

1965
02:04:03,768 --> 02:04:06,896
..C.B.I has arrested Chief
Minister Manohar Acharya for..

1966
02:04:06,972 --> 02:04:09,202
..possession of black money
and for buying legislative members..

1967
02:04:09,274 --> 02:04:11,003
..and media with the money.

1968
02:04:11,076 --> 02:04:13,203
Corruption! Shame!
Shame! Corruption! Shame! Shame!

1969
02:04:13,278 --> 02:04:14,905
Corruption! Shame! Shame!

1970
02:04:14,980 --> 02:04:16,311
Corruption! Shame! Shame!

1971
02:04:16,548 --> 02:04:17,810
Corruption! Shame! Shame!

1972
02:04:17,883 --> 02:04:19,180
Corruption! Shame! Shame! -
Sir, what about the 75 crores..

1973
02:04:19,251 --> 02:04:20,309
..that is with the police?

1974
02:04:20,552 --> 02:04:21,849
Sir, the countrymen want an answer.

1975
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:25,549
I would like to tell my
countrymen that I'm clean.

1976
02:04:25,624 --> 02:04:28,024
This is a fake tape. I'm being framed.

1977
02:04:29,628 --> 02:04:31,926
Someone has just thrown a
slipper at Mr. Manohar Acharya.

1978
02:04:31,997 --> 02:04:34,261
You can see that the
police is arresting that man.

1979
02:04:34,566 --> 02:04:37,558
After this stunning disclosure
the public and the opposition parties..

1980
02:04:37,636 --> 02:04:38,864
..have got enraged.

1981
02:04:38,937 --> 02:04:41,030
Rallies are being taken out
against Mr. Manohar Acharya in..

1982
02:04:41,106 --> 02:04:42,334
..different parts of the country.

1983
02:04:42,574 --> 02:04:45,236
You can see here that a
garland of slippers is being..

1984
02:04:45,310 --> 02:04:46,971
..put around the
puppet of Manohar Acharya.

1985
02:04:47,045 --> 02:04:49,036
Two prominent politicians
of Bhartiya Janadesh Party..

1986
02:04:49,114 --> 02:04:52,345
..and Swadesh party has
been suspended for taking bribe.

1987
02:04:52,651 --> 02:04:56,314
DCP Ramcharan
Sisodiya has also been suspended.

1988
02:04:57,088 --> 02:05:00,023
The CEO of News Media
Sailesh Roy and TV Live's President..

1989
02:05:00,091 --> 02:05:02,958
..Sohail Biswas who
were shown in the video..

1990
02:05:03,028 --> 02:05:05,053
..are also being questioned by the CBI.

1991
02:05:05,130 --> 02:05:07,826
You can see that it's
raining slippers behind me.

1992
02:05:07,899 --> 02:05:11,062
The public is enraged and
they are throwing slippers. Oh no!

1993
02:05:11,603 --> 02:05:12,763
Who threw this slipper?

1994
02:05:13,238 --> 02:05:14,535
We are from the media.

1995
02:05:14,606 --> 02:05:16,972
And now we would like to
tell you about the person..

1996
02:05:17,042 --> 02:05:19,010
..for whom all this became possible.

1997
02:05:19,077 --> 02:05:21,637
Adarsh Bharat Yuva
Dal's secretary Ashok Gandhi..

1998
02:05:21,713 --> 02:05:24,341
..says that this young man is
just 23 years old and is a student..

1999
02:05:24,583 --> 02:05:25,914
..of Delhi University.

2000
02:05:25,984 --> 02:05:30,580
He was offered a bribe of
15 crores not to give the tape.

2001
02:05:30,655 --> 02:05:33,590
But he valued his
honesty more than money.

2002
02:05:33,658 --> 02:05:35,717
And he understood his
responsibility towards his country.

2003
02:05:35,794 --> 02:05:38,922
This man handed over five
suitcases containing 15 crores each..

2004
02:05:38,997 --> 02:05:42,558
..that is 75 crores to the government.

2005
02:05:42,634 --> 02:05:44,795
The man has refused
to disclose his name and..

2006
02:05:44,869 --> 02:05:46,860
..he calls himself a common man.

2007
02:05:46,938 --> 02:05:52,570
NTV 24*7 salutes this unknown
hero on behalf of the entire country.

2008
02:05:52,644 --> 02:05:55,636
What a wonderful person! -
Yes man! He is the right guy!

2009
02:05:56,514 --> 02:05:58,175
Who does this nowadays?

2010
02:05:58,249 --> 02:06:00,183
I'm dying to know who he is.

2011
02:06:00,251 --> 02:06:02,685
I would love to meet
him. - Bye, see you, bye.

2012
02:06:10,562 --> 02:06:11,961
Protector.

2013
02:06:43,962 --> 02:06:45,759
Commuters please pay attention.

2014
02:06:45,830 --> 02:06:48,697
This is 11:40's last
metro from kendriya sachivalay..

2015
02:06:48,767 --> 02:06:51,235
..Central
Legislature to Badarpur border.

2016
02:07:04,549 --> 02:07:05,709
Hello there!

2017
02:07:09,020 --> 02:07:10,112
Lokesh!

2018
02:07:12,824 --> 02:07:15,725
What has happened to
you? - This? Just like this.

2019
02:07:16,594 --> 02:07:18,084
It's a long story. I'll tell you.

2020
02:07:18,329 --> 02:07:19,853
Tell something about yourself.

2021
02:07:20,065 --> 02:07:22,898
I've been travelling in this
last metro for the past four nights..

2022
02:07:23,201 --> 02:07:24,293
..just for you.

2023
02:07:24,536 --> 02:07:26,527
You told me that you
are doing one more show here.

2024
02:07:26,738 --> 02:07:27,898
That's the reason.

2025
02:07:29,741 --> 02:07:31,766
Today's show was at Gandhi Auditorium.

2026
02:07:33,044 --> 02:07:34,204
Thank you Bapu.

2027
02:07:34,279 --> 02:07:35,871
Seems Gandhiji will help us to unite.

2028
02:07:36,581 --> 02:07:37,673
That night was
Gandhi's birth anniversary and..

2029
02:07:37,749 --> 02:07:39,239
..today it is
Gandhi Auditorium, isn't it?

2030
02:07:40,919 --> 02:07:42,250
How are you Lavina?

2031
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:44,584
I'm happy but a bit confused.

2032
02:07:44,823 --> 02:07:45,949
Confused?

2033
02:07:46,024 --> 02:07:47,651
About what happened
that night? - That night..

2034
02:07:48,326 --> 02:07:50,692
..my tube light was
switched on after some time.

2035
02:07:50,995 --> 02:07:52,553
But it was finally switched on.

2036
02:07:52,997 --> 02:07:54,328
How come that happened?

2037
02:07:54,566 --> 02:07:56,557
You were defused till I was with you.

2038
02:07:57,502 --> 02:08:02,269
Just after you left the
electrician of my fortune entered.

2039
02:08:15,820 --> 02:08:19,085
It doesn't matter to me if
you keep the suitcase or not.

2040
02:08:19,290 --> 02:08:21,622
Give me the tape or
I'll shoot you right here.

2041
02:08:21,693 --> 02:08:22,887
Hey, leave him.

2042
02:08:22,961 --> 02:08:24,053
Shut up, you scoundrel.

2043
02:08:24,129 --> 02:08:26,029
Look, listen to me. - Shut your mouth.

2044
02:08:26,264 --> 02:08:29,756
It won't take me two seconds
to shoot a saleable dog like you.

2045
02:08:29,834 --> 02:08:31,131
Hey! - Hey!

2046
02:08:31,202 --> 02:08:32,794
You feel bad, right?

2047
02:08:33,004 --> 02:08:34,062
You are a dog.

2048
02:08:34,139 --> 02:08:36,130
Saleable dog belonging to Sisodiya.

2049
02:08:37,008 --> 02:08:38,839
You understand the term dog right?

2050
02:08:39,210 --> 02:08:44,147
Dog is loyal but to
the master who feeds him.

2051
02:08:44,716 --> 02:08:48,743
When a dog loses control he
doesn't leave his mother or sister.

2052
02:08:48,887 --> 02:08:50,582
There is no
difference between you and a dog.

2053
02:08:50,722 --> 02:08:53,282
Because you've set a
rate for your mother land.

2054
02:08:53,358 --> 02:08:55,258
You can also sell your mother. - Hey!

2055
02:08:55,326 --> 02:08:56,987
Quereshi, what are you doing?

2056
02:08:57,061 --> 02:08:58,494
Have you become crazy?

2057
02:08:58,563 --> 02:09:00,030
Look, you are a Muslim..

2058
02:09:00,498 --> 02:09:02,762
..and they belong to the
Hindu party Adarsh Bharat Dal.

2059
02:09:02,834 --> 02:09:05,029
They'll just throw you
out when their work gets done.

2060
02:09:05,103 --> 02:09:06,297
Try to understand.

2061
02:09:06,538 --> 02:09:09,939
Patriots are of the same
religion, you betrayer. Patriotism.

2062
02:09:11,109 --> 02:09:12,804
Come on give the tape else
your dead body will be lying here.

2063
02:09:12,877 --> 02:09:15,004
I'll give 15 crores to you too.

2064
02:09:15,580 --> 02:09:16,842
What do you say?

2065
02:09:17,081 --> 02:09:19,811
Give the tape. -
Lokesh, he won't do anything.

2066
02:09:19,884 --> 02:09:21,044
Don't give him the tape.

2067
02:09:21,119 --> 02:09:23,610
I'll get the tape over your dead body.

2068
02:09:26,024 --> 02:09:27,753
Quereshi, now..

2069
02:09:35,900 --> 02:09:38,232
Give me the tape, damn it.

2070
02:09:39,971 --> 02:09:41,268
I'm not an idiot like him.

2071
02:09:41,339 --> 02:09:44,331
I'll not count till three. I'll
take the tape over your dead body.

2072
02:09:45,009 --> 02:09:46,806
Give me the tape, damn it!

2073
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:49,806
Give me the tape.

2074
02:09:49,881 --> 02:09:51,542
It is my tape.

2075
02:09:51,616 --> 02:09:53,174
Come on give it to me, damn it.

2076
02:09:53,818 --> 02:09:56,218
Come on, bye.

2077
02:10:03,228 --> 02:10:06,664
I could've pulled the
trigger after two seconds.

2078
02:10:08,099 --> 02:10:10,192
But I want to give
you one more chance, Lucky.

2079
02:10:11,269 --> 02:10:14,295
If you sell yourself today you
won't be able to buy back yourself..

2080
02:10:14,372 --> 02:10:16,670
..in your entire life.

2081
02:10:18,776 --> 02:10:20,641
The decision is in your hands.

2082
02:10:22,113 --> 02:10:24,775
Do you want to become a dog or a man?

2083
02:10:28,319 --> 02:10:30,583
Hail India!

2084
02:10:31,289 --> 02:10:32,756
Quereshi.

2085
02:10:39,664 --> 02:10:40,961
Good that he died.

2086
02:10:41,266 --> 02:10:42,631
He was boring me.

2087
02:10:43,701 --> 02:10:44,895
Lokesh!

2088
02:10:45,837 --> 02:10:47,395
Come to your senses, my king.

2089
02:10:48,873 --> 02:10:50,306
All this keep on
happening. Give me the tape..

2090
02:10:50,642 --> 02:10:52,007
..go home and count the money.

2091
02:11:10,895 --> 02:11:12,624
I'm so proud of you Lokesh.

2092
02:11:13,097 --> 02:11:15,122
But why didn't you
disclose your name in the interview?

2093
02:11:15,366 --> 02:11:17,596
You would've become a hero
if you had disclosed your name.

2094
02:11:17,669 --> 02:11:20,729
That's because I did nothing heroic.

2095
02:11:21,272 --> 02:11:23,240
I just did what I felt was right.

2096
02:11:23,741 --> 02:11:26,835
And I don't want useless
credit for not doing anything wrong.

2097
02:11:27,378 --> 02:11:29,778
But you are a hero, my hero.

2098
02:11:32,717 --> 02:11:34,275
Oh no!

2099
02:11:34,352 --> 02:11:35,910
If you had kissed me like this
the other night then I would've..

2100
02:11:35,987 --> 02:11:37,352
..forgotten 75 crores just like this.

2101
02:11:38,189 --> 02:11:39,713
Just a second, just a second.

2102
02:11:40,758 --> 02:11:41,952
Naughty!

2103
02:11:42,093 --> 02:11:43,856
Did you call us madam?

2104
02:11:48,933 --> 02:11:51,299
There is no one naughtier than us.

2105
02:11:52,603 --> 02:11:55,663
Mr. Captain, we've got this fellow.

2106
02:11:57,008 --> 02:11:58,805
Tell us what shall we do?

2107
02:11:59,243 --> 02:12:00,642
Let him go.

2108
02:12:02,580 --> 02:12:04,343
He has made a place
for himself in my heart..

2109
02:12:04,582 --> 02:12:06,846
..by letting go of 75 crores.

2110
02:12:07,318 --> 02:12:08,876
We are useless chaps.

2111
02:12:09,053 --> 02:12:10,918
We even steal bananas and then eat them.

2112
02:12:11,889 --> 02:12:14,824
Kiss her I am not watching.

2113
02:12:16,594 --> 02:12:18,789
Kiss her else we'll kiss her.

2114
02:12:19,197 --> 02:12:20,357
No, no.

2115
02:12:20,698 --> 02:12:23,223
The next station is
Lajpatnagar. - I'll kiss her at home.

2116
02:12:23,301 --> 02:12:25,826
My stop has come. Bye.

2117
02:12:26,170 --> 02:12:27,637
I had almost died there.

2118
02:12:27,705 --> 02:12:29,673
I don't want such
surprises in life. - Really?

2119
02:12:29,741 --> 02:12:31,106
Then what sort of surprise do you want?

2120
02:12:37,215 --> 02:12:38,614
Mercedes?

2121
02:12:39,050 --> 02:12:40,608
It's mine.

2122
02:12:40,918 --> 02:12:42,078
Really? - Yes!

2123
02:12:43,721 --> 02:12:46,189
How did you by such an expensive car?

2124
02:12:46,257 --> 02:12:49,317
I helped the government
nab 75 crores of black money.

2125
02:12:49,394 --> 02:12:52,022
The government awarded me with 10%.

2126
02:12:52,363 --> 02:12:55,628
I bought this car and a flat too.

2127
02:12:55,700 --> 02:12:56,962
Really? - Yes.

2128
02:12:58,903 --> 02:13:00,131
You are a rock star.

2129
02:13:00,304 --> 02:13:01,862
Rock star protector.

2130
02:13:04,008 --> 02:13:06,169
Who says that honesty is not in fashion?

2131
02:13:06,244 --> 02:13:09,680
It's the in thing. Its hit, super hit.
