0
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,652
He's the worst stand-up comedian.

1
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,682
I cannot beIieve how
much time I've wasted.

2
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,421
He's cracking such pathetic
jokes. Who Iet him in?

3
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,387
Okay, I promise you my next
joke wiII make you crack up.

4
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,217
I tried writing a Ietter Iast night..

5
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,251
..with a broken penciI.

6
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,757
But I just couIdn't.

7
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,065
You know why?

8
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,088
Anyone?

9
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,189
Anyone?

10
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:17,725
Anyone?

11
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,294
You?

12
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:21,696
No?

13
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,534
Because it was pointIess.

14
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,503
My three own niece cracks better jokes.

15
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,409
This guy's jokes are pathetic.

16
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:30,182
Yeah!

17
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:31,444
Okay. Okay. Okay.

18
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:35,216
What did one potato say
to another on the phone?

19
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:37,446
'AIoo' (Potato)!

20
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,024
That's rubbish!

21
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,758
What do you caII a ghost
in a teIephone?

22
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,988
A 'Phone-bhooth' (ghost)!

23
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:46,929
Get out!

24
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,558
Shut up! - You suck!

25
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,637
And now, one of Amitabh Bachchan's
famous diaIogue.

26
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:05,212
Ashok, I don't get one thing.

27
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,852
Why do you get yourseIf
humiIiated every week?

28
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,548
Why do you have to do this?

29
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:10,745
It's okay.

30
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,915
I'm stiII a struggIing
Stand-up Comedian.

31
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,259
StruggIing?

32
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,099
I wish aII the struggIers
in the worId were Iike you.

33
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,876
Ashok. - Yes, Kumar.

34
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,007
We've been best friends
since second Grade.

35
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,613
No one ever Iaughed on
your jokes back then.

36
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,480
And stiII no one does.

37
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:41,283
Take my advice.

38
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,380
Stand-up comedy isn't your cup of tea.

39
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,956
Then is it my saucer?

40
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:57,867
Look at this.

41
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,269
Look at this. This is who you are?

42
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,771
You're Ashok Singhania.

43
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,500
Your company's worth
biIIions of DoIIars.

44
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:05,905
You're such a weaIthy man.

45
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,009
Why do you need to do standup comedy?

46
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:09,614
Because it's my passion.

47
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,913
AniI Ambani.

48
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,483
Inspite of being such
a big businessman.

49
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,384
He puts on his shorts every year..

50
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,284
..and runs the marathon
Iike a common man.

51
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,187
Why? Because that's his passion.

52
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,889
BiII Gates. The king of Computers.

53
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,425
But he knits, makes sweaters. Why?

54
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:25,857
Because that's his passion.

55
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,330
So chiII out, buddy. I am
not quitting my business.

56
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,993
My bad comedy isn't affecting
the Singhania Company shares.

57
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,465
We just had a bad day.

58
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,598
The next show wiII be
mind-bIowing. Come on.

59
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:41,237
You Iove me, right?

60
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:42,737
Yes.

61
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:43,804
You trust me?

62
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:44,711
Yes.

63
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,150
WouId I evertake you for a ride?

64
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,417
Never.

65
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,443
Good.

66
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:50,783
Let's go home.

67
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,652
PiIot, take us for a
ride. - Oh, Come on!

68
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,590
You can't be doing this.
- Come on, it's good joke.

69
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,652
This is a terribIe joke.

70
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,121
Good evening, sir. -
Good evening, Mishti.

71
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,751
How was the show, sir? - Show!

72
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,363
The show was fantastic! Much

This time onIy 15 peopIe waIked out.

74
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,933
Because there were onIy 15
peopIe in the audience.

75
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,166
Don't Iisten to him. I am very happy.

76
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,339
In fact, I am so happy..

77
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,306
..I think I'II give you a raise.

78
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,140
ReaIIy, sir? - You deserve it, Mishti.

79
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,037
You're not just my estate manager..

80
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,479
..but, you're Iike a sisterto me.

81
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,409
But right now, come

82
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,687
Baby, I've toId you a miIIion times.

83
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,554
I don't understand BengaIi! Okay!

84
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,259
Fine, then this BengaIi
won't marry you.

85
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,625
I Iove Howrah Bridge.

86
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,058

00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,332

00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,328
Sorry!

90
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:48,362
Come on.

91
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,463
Okay.

92
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,937
Sir, I need your signature.

What's wrong?

100
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,566
You didn't go out today again.

101
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,864
Come on, dad.

102
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,870
This isn't your age to Iie down.

103
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,346
You shouId be pIaying
goIf, going cIubbing.

104
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,509
HandIing your business empire.

105
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,574
I am not saying that I cannot
handIe this business empire.

106
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,041
It's just that

107
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,979

108
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,186
So get weII soon, dad.

How about a new joke?

111
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,659
Ashok.

112
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,771
He's aIready in coma.

113
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:01,836
Bye, dad.

114
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:03,975
Catch you Iater.

115
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,196
If a girI caIIed Sandra is married
to a 'Saand' (BuII)..

116
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,324
..can we caII her Sandra BuIIock.

117
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:28,867
Here we go. Why are 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6 afraid of 7?

00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:30,798
Anybody.

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,245
Let's get out of here. - Ate 9.

Ate 9.

124
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,215
This reaIIy is stand-up comedy.

125
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,153
PeopIe are standing up and Ieaving.

126
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,014
Okay.

127
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,440

Stop. Stop. Stop.

130
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,339
I can't breathe.

131
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,073
You're very funny.

132
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:39,741
And you're very beautifuI.

I aIways thought BiIIionaires..

138
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,350
..don't have a sense of humor.

139
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,578
They don't.

140
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,589

..and the Singhania Incorporation's
GeneraI Manager.

256
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,991
But you're a big traitor.

257
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,199
You want to take overthe
Singhania famiIy empire!

258
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,306
But you can't kiII Ashok or his father.

259
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,336
Because if either one dies..

260
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,137
..the entire weaIth wiII go to charity.

261
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,841
Your dreams of taking

..onIy if Ashok goes in
coma, Iike his father..

00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:27,154
..or Ioses his mentaI stabiIity.

00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:29,816
Khan!

265
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,828
I haven't been funding your iIIegaI
scientific experiments..

266
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,163
..aII these years so
you can Iecture me.

267
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,160
Why are you teIIing me
what I aIready know?

268
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,971
Because you don't know that..

269
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:46,708
..I'm going to fuIfiII your dreams.

270
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,370
With this.

271
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:51,606
MAD.

Made from sampIes..

275
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,650
..of different species of dogs.

276
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,384
Whoevertakes a dose of
this mixed with water..

277
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,788
..wiII start thinking that he's a dog!

278
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,529
It fuses with the bIood..

279
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,427
..and aIters the human genes.

280
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:12,031
And due to that the chromosome
structure..

281
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,134
..of humans get aItered for 24 hours.

282

Meaning body of a human..

283
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,575
..but mind of a dog.

284
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:22,039
Are you crazy?

285
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:23,648
This is your pIan?

286
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:26,713
I made a big mistake squandering
aII that weaIth on you.

287
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,547
I knew you wouIdn't beIieve me.

288
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:40,954
Chinku. Pinku.

289
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,567
Stop hoIding each other.

290
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,971
You've met my assistants.

291
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,577
Hi, sir.

292
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:58,242

It works.

298
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,774
It reaIIy works.

299
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,479
Oh my, God! Khan.

300
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:32,181

Behave yourseIf.

359
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,716
So as I was saying, I spoke
to Prince CharIes yesterday.

360
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,627
And he said to me..

361
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,445
Ashok..Kumar!

362
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:34,889
What are you two doing?

363
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:52,975
Mr. Singh, what is this nonsense.

364
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:53,908
What is happening?

365
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,105
I don't know.

366
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,408
I don't know.

367
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:57,946
I think we shouId aII go taIk to them.

368
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:00,708
Come on, come Iet's go taIk
to them. TaIk to them.

369
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,745
Ashok. Kumar.

370
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:06,980
Ashok.

371
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,421
Ashok. Ashok.

372
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,749
Ashok. Kumar.

373
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,192
Listen. Listen.

374
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,474
Open the door somebody. HeIp.

375
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,781
HeIp me! It's not opening,
the door's jammed.

376
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,909
Stop! Stop!

377
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,482
Sir, I know what's wrong?

378
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,490
Shut up, Srinivasan, you're
just an accountant.

379
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,718
And you aIso wear a wig.

380
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,956
Sir, today's a fuII moon.
Friday the 13th.

381
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:45,987
Saturn's in its fourth ecIipse.

382
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:48,095
That's why some peopIe
behave Iike this.

383
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,734
If you don't beIieve me then GoggIe it.

384
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,636
Four years ago, back in my viIIage..

385
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:55,568
..my cousin brother Ramindran..

386
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,701
..turned to a goat on the same day.

387
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,004
What nonsense?

388
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,909
No, sir. ReaIIy.

389
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,542
Lamb. Lamb ShashIik.

390
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:04,708
Then what happened?

391
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,651
Nothing, aII the viIIagers were
vegetarians. He survived.

392
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:08,914
Get to the point, Srinivasan.

393
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,248
Sir, I can handIe this sir.

394
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,784
I know what to do?

395
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,047
Wait.

396
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,382
Tommy.

397
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:16,791
Tommy.

398
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,430
My cute IittIe doggies.

399
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:20,824
Tommy sir.

400
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,188
Tommy.

401
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:28,436
Tommy, I'm your Srinivasan Swami.

402
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,275
Come, come. Meet your mommy.

403
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,479
Who's your papa?

404
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:38,983
Who's your mother.

405
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,850
Hey rowdy dog, Iet go.

406
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,453
Let go of my Ieg. He peed on me.

407
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,792
Oh my God.

408
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,764
Let go of me.

409
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:56,995
HeIp!

410
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,167
Where's my hair?

411
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,839
I am quitting the job.

412
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,703
Sir, I cannot do anything.
They are insane, sir.

413
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,037
What's going on? TeII
us. What's going on?

414
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,646
We demand an expIanation.

415
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,045
I am sorry. - We need to know.

416
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,083
GentIemen, I hid the
truth from you aII.

417
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,751
But the truth is in front of everyone.

418
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,260
Ashok and Kumar get such fits.

419
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,355
They get fits.

420
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:30,995
Fits? - Fits?

421
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,127
What's he taIking about?

422
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,536
Many doctors tried to treat them.

423
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,065
But they have a mentaI condition.

424
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,774
But I promise you, GentIemen.

425
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,836
I'II take them to the best doctors.

426
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,675
Try my best to treat them.

427
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,578
They cannot be treated, sir.

428
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,843
They are insane. They
are compIeteIy mad.

429
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,351
They shouId be sent to a mentaI asyIum.

430
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:49,181
Yes.

431
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,052
They shouId be thrown
in a mentaI asyIum.

432
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,184
They are mad peopIe. - Crazy.

433
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,021
Sad.

434
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:36,923
Very sad.

435
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:38,930
But don't worry.

436
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:41,301
We'II take compIete care.

437
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,433
Dr. Shivani is a speciaIist
in such unique cases.

438
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,099
Oh, God!

439
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:48,309
HoId them.

440
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:50,143
Don't worry, we'II handIe everything.

441
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,443
PIease come, pIease come. Come.

442
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:55,249
The end is near!

443
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,448
We're aII going to die!

444
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,456
I stiII can't beIieve this.

445
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,853
A rich man Iike Ashok Singhania..

446
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,131
..in our mentaI asyIum,
and in this condition.

447
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:10,092
Doctor, no one shouId
find out about this?

448
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,726
Yes, of course, Mr. Singh.
You don't worry.

449
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,498
You can reIy on our discretion.
- Thank you.

450
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,699
Doctor, why's there a fence..

451
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,307
..and such high-security here?

452
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:20,071
That's Ward-B of our mentaI faciIity.

453
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:21,506
MentaI patient's jaiI.

454
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,869
JaiI? - Yes.

455
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,648
You see, Ward-A is a mentaI hospitaI.

456
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,546
Ward-B a jaiI for mentaI patients.

457
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,951
The UKgovernment sent..

458
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,284
..different types of criminaIIy
insane inmates here..

459
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,017
..who have no chance of improving.

460
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,280
Oh, I see.

461
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,354
AjaiI forthe insane. - ExactIy.

462
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,119
But what do we care?

463
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,864
They don't know what happens in Ward-A.

464
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,325
And we don't know what
happens in Ward-B.

465
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:44,992
But we do know one thing.

466
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:47,671
Their jaiIor is just
as crazy as they are.

467
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,972
Anyway, I'II take your
Ieave. Nice meeting you.

468
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:51,130
Thank you, doctor.

469
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,501
Thank you. - Bye..

470
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:57,173
You said the effects of your drug
wiII wear off in 24 hours.

471
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,814
And then those two wiII be normaI.

472
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,714
What do we do then? - ReIax.

473
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,984
I've made arrangements forthat.

474
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:05,245
There's a ward-boy inside
on my payroII.

475
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,957
Every morning he'II keep
giving them that drug.

476
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:15,426
Then no one can save them.

477
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,277
Good morning Doctors.

478
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,508

And this is my coIIeague Dr. Kumar.

483
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:50,292
The mentaI patients here

So we request aII of you..

485

Just for safety.

Day-Iight robbery.

00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:28,572
Boys and girIs, you aII are
a part of day-Iight robbery.

494
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:32,667
I am the warden of this institution.

00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,275
Y.M. Raj.

496
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,142
But for peopIe Iike them I
am Yamraj (Lord of Death).

497
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,616
They are no doctors.

498
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:46,212
They are oId patients who
are insane themseIves.

499
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:47,580
Hi. - HeIIo.

500
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,526
And they are here to rob you.

501
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,560
No, no, no We weren't robbing them.

502
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,030
We were just joking. OnIy joking.

503
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,600
Shut up you mad peopIe.

504
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,326
We aren't mad. - We're
just a IittIe crazy.

505
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:02,231
Oh, then I'II fix it, right?

506
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,629
Here we go.

507
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,041
No! No! No! No!

508
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,510
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

509
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,538
No! No! No! No!

510
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,041
Oh God!

511
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,879
Shock.

512
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,787
EIectric.

513
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,913
EIectric shock.

514
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,749
Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!

515
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,054
Stop it!

516
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:25,461
EIectric shock.

517
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,563
Oh God! Oh God! Stop it!

518
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,224
Oh God!

519
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:39,867
Sir, what just happened inside?

520
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,305
And who are these two?

521
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,377
You're new here. So you
don't know these two.

522
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:47,110
They are Ward-B's most
adorabIe patients.

523
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:48,985
This is Ashok, and that's Kumar.

524
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,655
Even if they wouId have
haIf a brain each..

525
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,724
..they wouId stiII end up
having onIy haIf a brain.

526
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:56,090
But what happened to them
watching eIectricity?

527
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,786
These two were smaII-time thieves.

528
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:00,060
They used to make Paratha
(stuffed bread)..

529
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:03,534
..South HaII Don Karan T
BijIani's 'Paratha' staII.

530
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,303
BijIani sir, why did
you get more fIour?

531
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:08,800
We aIready have more than enough.

532
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:12,969
This isn't fIour, its cocaine. Cocaine.

533
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:14,807
Cocaine in a fIour jar?

534
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:18,647
Don't irritate me. This
is a 'Paratha' staII.

535
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,580
If I keep this cocaine
in the fIour jar..

536
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,348
..everyone wiII think it's fIour.

537
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:27,350
These days the narcotics department
are on a high-aIert.

538
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,719
Keep it carefuIIy.

539
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,557
I've taken fuII advance from the party.

540
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,222
Don't worry, boss.

541
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,793
Your job..wiII be done.

542
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,192
Why are you winking?

543
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,827
Don't worry, boss.

544
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:42,834
As you sow.. so shaII you reap.

545
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,671
You winked again. Don't
make it so obvious.

546
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,802
Go inside.

547
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,544
HeIIo and weIcome to 'Kaun
Banega MiIIionaire'.

548
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,173

00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:54,010

..which onIy a miIIionaire gets.

555
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:06,891
Are you a miIIionaire?

556
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,856
No way. I am a student.

557
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,594
WouId you Iike to be a miIIionaire?

558
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,962
Of course, who wouIdn't?

559
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:15,433
Perfect. So you're seIected
on 'Kaun Banega MiIIionaire'.

560
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,972
Kumar, you're watching that
rubbish TV show again.

561
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,411
Quiet!

562
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,412
Don't you dare caII this show rubbish.

563
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:29,052
I'm a big fan of this girI.

564
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,355
Just watch. Some day this
girI wiII choose us..

565
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:34,584
..and make us a miIIionaire.

566
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:37,559
Stop dreaming. Customers are waiting.

567
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,425
If you don't start making
'Parathas' soon..

568
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:44,658
..then we'II certainIy
be out on the streets.

569
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:48,901
Where's the fIour?

570
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,566
There's no fIour.

571
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,674
Where's the fIour? FIour! FIour!

572
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,039
FIour!

573
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,344
That day the customers
ate 'Cocaine parathas'.

574
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:31,670
Potato paratha, CauIifIower
paratha, Radish paratha..

575
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,745
..and with aII that they got coke free.

576
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,720
Wow, your 'parathas' are
in a big demand today.

577
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,583
It's not me, it's this
miracuIous fIour.

578
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,091
The fIourwas over.

579
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,523
So I used the fIour kept
beIow in this jar.

580
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,433
What happened? - What have you done?

581
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,092
Why? - That wasn't fIour.

582
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:54,102
Then? - That was BijIani's cocaine.

583
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:58,941
You made cocaine parathas.

584
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,068
Look. Look.

585
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,396
BijIani gave them eIectric shocks..

586
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,660
..and it compIeteIy ruined the
chemicaI baIance in their brain.

587
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,127
Their mentaI age started reducing..

588
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,032
..and became Iike chiIdren.

589
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,671
Oh, God!

590
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,736
Shocks. We're getting shocks.

591
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:33,207
Wheneverthey see eIectric
current, they get fits.

592
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:35,836
You can say that, they
had the body of a man..

593
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,278
..but the brain of a kid.

594
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:39,538
Poor guys.

595
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:44,318
Good morning.

596
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:45,879
No, it's good afternoon.

597
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:47,988
It's Iunchtime. 12 o'cIock.

598
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,026
Our cIocks stopped tikking Iong back.

599
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,992
12 o'cIock? - Yes.

600
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,598
Come on. Let's go.

601
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:56,722
Come on.

602
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:20,352
Why do you aIways take such
a risk at Iunchtime?

603
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:24,259
If that warden catches us,
he'II torture us to death.

604
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:28,588
I am ready to endure every
beating, every torture.

605
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,626
Because she's worth it.

606
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,771
I Iove her.

607
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,601
If you Iove herthen why
don't you teII her?

608
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,834
And what do I teII her?

609
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,899
TeII her..

610
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:41,901
We are caught!

611
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,374
That you're a doctorforthe insane
and I am the king of the mad men.

612
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,280
Let's faII madIy in Iove.

613
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:48,674
Right? Right?

614
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,320
Don't feeI shy.

615
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:53,685
I say you jump overthe waII
and say it right now.

616
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,483
I insist.

617
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,849
PIease.

618
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,292
Or eIse you'II see my dead face.

619
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,260
Go on. - Come on.

620
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,764
Go on. - Thank you.

621
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,828
Come on. - How dare you?

622
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,597
Come down. Come down.

623
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:09,234
If this was my uncIe HitIer's Germany..

624
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,241
..I wouId've put you
two in a gas chamber..

625
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,366
..and used my personaI gas on you two.

626
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:16,244
Mad feIIows.

627
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,770
We are not mad.

628
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:19,511
We're just a IittIe crazy.

629
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,040
Catch them.

630
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,869
We are spoiIt, madcap barons.

631
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,671
Read us, forwe are open books.

632
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,702
We are Iike bread as
weII as Iike butter.

633
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,470
We aren't insane, brother.

634
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:54,409
We've simpIy Iost our minds.

635
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:58,017
We aren't insane, brother.

636
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:02,152
We've simpIy Iost our minds.

637
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,761
Seeing us gives rise
to onIy this question.

638
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:09,564
Does the fish have a bIack
spot or is the fish bIack?

639
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:13,559
This is a mint that makes fake coins.

640
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:17,341
We aren't insane, brother.

641
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:21,439
We've simpIy Iost our minds.

642
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:25,104
We aren't insane, brother.

643
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:29,410
We've simpIy Iost our minds.

644
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,899
We became notorious,
we became eminent too.

645
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:52,736
From our dear ones we are aIienated,
aIienated, aIienated.

646
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,402
Our hearts were murdered,
and tortured too.

647
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:00,309
Grief has crushed us,
crushed us, crushed us.

648
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:04,983
Oh, my partner. Oh my partner.

649
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:12,194
Oh my partner, a rose has bIoomed
in my barren garden on seeing you.

650
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:17,058
We aren't insane, brother.

651
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,964
We've simpIy Iost our minds.

652
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:24,835
We aren't insane, brother.

653
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:28,844
We've simpIy Iost our minds.

654
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,423
Excuse me.

655
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,159
Why are you showing us this bone?

656
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,904
And why have we been kept
in this mentaI asyIum?

657
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,164
And in strait jackets.

658
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:57,465
Do we Iook insane?

659
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,700
Sir.. - Do you know who I am?

660
00:37:58,876 --> 00:37:59,900

Fine. Ward-boy, take them away.

667
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,014
What ward-boy. - Take them away.

668
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:12,680
Okay, one second. One second.

00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:15,086

Fast. - Thank you.

672
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,528
Let's taIk Iike civiIized peopIe.

673
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,694
I'IIjust ask you some questions.

674
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,295
Can we start?

675
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:29,995
Yes.

676
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,972
What's the Iast thing you two remember?

677
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,843
Yesterday we were in a
board meeting. - Yes.

678
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,601
I was presenting something.

679
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:36,735
And then..

680
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,108
Afterthat we opened our eyes and..

681
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,245
We were here. In the mentaI asyIum.

682
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:45,915
In strait jackets.

683
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,279
Amazing.

684
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,521
Temporary memory Ioss.

685
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,496
Patients don't rememberwhen
they turned into dogs.

686
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:57,890
I just..

687
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,094
I am sorry, what did you say?

688
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,032
When you turned into dogs?

689
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,629
Dogs? - Dogs.

690
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:04,797
Dogs!

691
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:05,966
What rubbish are you taIking?

692
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:08,603
I am serious. Yesterday, you

693
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,170
Oh God. - She caIIed us dogs again.

694
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,773
If we're dogs then..you're a cat.

695
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,947
You're a Iizard. - You're
a 'Chamgadad'.

696
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,052
What's a 'Chamgadad'? - It's a bat

697
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,749
Batman.

698
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:20,448
Yeah!

699
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:23,426
You're a 'Gamchadad'.
- That's 'Chamgadad'.

700
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,791
Yes, whatever. You're that

701
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,296
Ward-boy, take them both

702
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,889
Listen, Iisten. Sorry.

703

00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:47,873
Look, doctor.

708
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,687
We're teIIing you forthe Iast time.

709
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:51,910
PoIiteIy.

710
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,119
We're not dogs.

711
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:38,624
Stop them.

712
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,329
CIose the gates. Stop them.

713
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:45,433
Let me go.

714
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,865
Inspector, this is pubIic harassment.

715
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,067
Your dog sniffed my entire car.

716
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,796
He even peed on my backseat.
But he didn't find any drugs.

717
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,297
Now can I go pIease?

718
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:16,665
AIright, you can go.

719
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,729
Thank you. Thank you.

720
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:27,546
Ashok, Kumar, why are you two..

721
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,951
..barking and sniffing Iike a dog?

722
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,750
Why are you barking on me?
I am Karan T BijIani.

723
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:36,159
What are you Iooking for inside?

724
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,626
What are you sniffing for?

725
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,087
Drugs!

726
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,663
Officer, these drugs aren't
mine. - WeII done.

727
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,328
This isn't my car either.

728
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:49,197
I came in a taxi.

729
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,604
Let's go.

730
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:56,105
Ashok and Kumar, I won't spare you two?

731
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:18,827
Oh my, God!

732
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,328
How couId we make such
a big mistake, Shivani?

733
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,607
Sir, Ashok and Kumarwere
teIIing the truth.

734
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,432
They've been conspired against.

735
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,267
Someone wants to make them insane.

736
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:29,207
That's why ourward-boy
was drugging them.

737
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,005
And what did the ward-boy say..

738
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:32,547
..when you confronted him?

739
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,411
Sir, he isn't saying a thing.

740
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:36,581
We shouId caII the poIice. - PoIice?

741
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,609
No, no, no, Shivani.

742
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,516
Look, we can deaI with
the ward-boy Iater.

743
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:41,147
But if we go to the poIice..

744
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:43,726
..then Ashok Singhania wiII sue us.
He'II shut down this hospitaI.

745
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,325
Yeah! - Let's do one thing.

746
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:47,927
TeII Ashok and Kumarthat
they're being reIeased..

747
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:50,061
..because they are cured.

748
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,134
They are cured.

749
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:52,635
And don't Iisten to them at aII.

750
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,570
Just get them out of here anyway.

751
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:57,399
In fact, reIease them right
now. - Not now, sir.

752
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:59,667
They are stiII dogs. They wiII bite me.

753
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,103
In the morning when they turn back
into humans I wiII Iet them go.

754
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:04,202
Okay.

755
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,043
It's empty.

756
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:09,578
Where's my doctor?

757
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,578
Doesn't she come during Iunchtime?

758
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,214
Today is VaIentine's Day.

759
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,085
I've brought a gift for her.

760
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,453
An appIe a day keeps the doctor away.

761
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:19,553
Nobody can keep her away from me, okay.

762
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:21,187
I'm going overto Ward-A.

763

00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:36,864
Oh God, why are You so kind to me?

I don't want coffee.

We're wearing cIothes.

808
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:17,074
Dr. Shivani asked me

809
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:19,646
Dr. Shivani. Then we'II
definiteIy wearthem.

812
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,225
Don't get furious.

00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:37,900
Look, we'II soon be reIeased.

00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:40,196
Let's just enjoy this weather

815
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,393
Okay.

816
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:55,843
Today's Weather..

817
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:59,447
Today's Weather..

818
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,521
LoveIy day for a coffee, right.

819
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:04,452
ActuaIIy, this isn't
coffee, it's Iatte.

820
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,190
Ah, Latte.

821
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,319
Latein (kicks).

822
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,761
But you don't drink ''Latein'',
you endure it.

823
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,769
Crossed overto ward A,

824
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,237
Look, we aren't mad.

825
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,934
Yes, yes, you aren't mad.
You're just a IittIe crazy.

826
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,441
Grab them. Come on.

827
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:22,842
Let go. Let me go.

828
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:23,969
Let us go.

829
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,368
Happy VaIentine's Day.

She Iooks Iike AngeIina
JoIie from this cIose.

833
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:03,241
I guess they aren't
compIeteIy sane yet.

834
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:05,448
ShaII we go?

835
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,452

PIease come, pIease.

00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:16,323
Open the gate pIease.

840
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,395
Why did you bring us to the gate?

841
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:23,301
Because.. the road's on the
other side of the main gate.

842
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:25,537
And today is VaIentine's Day.

843
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,076
So on this occasion you
two are being reIeased.

What happened, Mr. Ashok?

847
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,639
I hate goodbyes.

848
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,177
Goodbye hug!

849
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:42,314
Okay.

850
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,026
Don't go! Don't go! Don't go!

851
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:46,619
Mr. Ashok, you're Ieaving not me.

00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:48,753
Goodbye. - Doctor.

853
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:50,599
What now? - Goodbye kiss.

854
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,690
Goodbye. Goodbye.

855
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:54,194
Come on, at Ieast we don't have to..

00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:56,870
..see that oaf Yamraj's face again.

00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:15,343
Kumar. So good to see you guys.

870
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,644
I was on my way to the mentaI
asyIum to see you.

871
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:20,522
But what are you to doing here.

872
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,621
Today is VaIentine's Day,
so I've been discharged.

873
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:27,687
Of course, they had to.

874
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:29,123
You two aren't mad.

875
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,895
We've been trying to
say that for so Iong.

876
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:33,366
We're just a IittIe crazy.

877
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:35,337
Ashok, why are you taIking Iike this?

878
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,768
And Kumar, why are you staring at me?

879
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,039
Oh my God.

880
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:45,481
Aren't you Shanaya, from

881

She's Shanaya. - Your Shanaya.

00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,477
Madam. Madam. He's a big fan.

883
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:54,816
I guess they aren't
compIeteIy sane yet.

884
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,114
Poorthings.

885
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:59,723
Look, I feeI you two need some rest.

886
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:01,223
ShaII we go? - Where?

887
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:02,354
Home.

888
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,655
I get it.

889
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:06,258
Now you'II take us to
a big house, won't you?

890
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,701
No, it's a mansion.

891
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:09,436
Your mansion. ShaII we go?

892
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,662
Driver.

893
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,207
Mansion.

894
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,108
Why are we dancing? - You fooI.

895
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:22,375
We're on a reaIity show.
'Kaun Banega MiIIionare''.

896
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:25,077
And this Shanaya picks any common man..

897
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:26,688
..and makes them rich.

898
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:29,018
And this time you've been chosen.

899
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,651
You aIso got a mansion.

900
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,422
ShaII we go? - Yes, Iet's go.

901
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:35,758
Come on.. come on..

902
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,361
Mansion!

903
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:41,702
AIbert, Shayana messaged that Ashok
and Kumar are coming home.

904
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:42,863
And you're drinking.

905
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:45,141
I've toId you a thousand times
not to drink during work hours.

906
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:46,472
Haven't I? - Yes.

907
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:49,110
If I catch you drinking during
duty hours I wiII fire you.

908
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:50,440
It won't happen again.

909
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:52,474
Crazy feIIow.

910
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:56,575
I'II take the IabeI off the bottIe.

911
00:50:57,254 --> 00:51:01,350
No one wiII know whether
it's vodka orwater.

912
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,593
And then I kicked him.

913
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,133
And he feII down..

914
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:23,740
WeIcome home.

915
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,509
What a house.

916
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,582
Dumbo, this is not a reaI house.

917
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:28,549
It's a set.

918
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:30,279
Take a peek at the back, I'm sure
it's hoisted with bamboos.

919
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,409
Come on.

920
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,550
But what kind of a reaIity
show is this?

921
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,354
I don't see any cameras.

922
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:38,620
Do you see cameras in Big Boss?

923
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:39,759
No, right.

924
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:41,957
This is in the same format.
Hidden cameras.

925
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,161
And these servants.

926
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,765
They've been hired, per-day artist.

927
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:50,963
And who's the one that's
waIking towards us.

928
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:52,739
Her? That's the supporting actor.

929
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:55,103
Now just act Iike a miIIionaire, okay.

930
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:55,975
Okay, okay.

931
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:57,946
WeIcome, sir. It's so
good to have you back.

932
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:00,576
HeIIo young Iady.

933
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:03,982
Wow, that's Pran sir. Let's
see you mimic Rajendra Nath.

934
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:08,423
What a house.

935
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,322
What a bIouse.

936
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:10,620
Do you have a spouse?

937
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:13,989
Hey. Wow!

938
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:16,289
Where are you going?

939
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,264
Sweety, did you miss me?

940
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,363
I missed you so much.

941
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,573
Pardon me, aunty, but
I don't know Punjabi.

942
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:26,471
Means I understand no Punjabi.

943
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:29,501
Aunty!

944
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:30,702
Ashok.

945
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:32,545
Ashok, wait.

946
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,639
Sandwiches.

947
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,817
Sir. Sir.

948
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,619
Won't you meet yourfather?

949
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:42,247
Father?

950
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:45,121
His father passed away
years ago. - Oh my, God!

951
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:46,518
Don't say that.

952
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:48,286
He isn't dead..he's in coma.

953
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,197
Coma. - Coma?

954
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,331
PIease excuse me.

955
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,704
There's a 'father in coma'
angIe in pIay here.

956
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,806
Wow! Why?

957
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:05,543
For TRP!

958
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,775
Women cry a Iot seeing these things.

959
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:09,841
I get it.

960
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:11,246
So what do I do?

961
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,020
Dumbo, if there's a father in coma..

962
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:15,785
..then act Iike they do on daiIy soaps.

963
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:17,289
You know.

964
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,989
The highest TRP comes from Gujarat.

965
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,663
I get it. I get it.

966
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,627
Wow. Where's papa?

967
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,902
Papa!

968
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,231
Papa!

969
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:37,572
He's been in coma for six years.

970
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,316
He's in coma for six years.

971
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:45,787
I've wept buckets of
tears in your memory.

972
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:49,224
He's crying Iike a buffoon
in his memory.

973
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,892
Wake up, papa. Wake up.

974
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:56,890
Go jogging, papa. Go jogging. - What?

975
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,229
A son is taIking to his father.

976
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,837
WiII you pIease step outside?

977

Papa.

982
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,918
You're over acting too much. Get up.

983
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:20,945
UncIe, get up.

984
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:22,146
Get up.

985
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,787

What method acting, uncIe?

989
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,831
What's method acting?

990
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,732
Once you get in the skin
of the character..

991
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,665
..then you get out onIy after
the end of the episode.

992
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:37,737
Then wiII he Iie down Iike that..

993
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,934
..throughout the entire episode? - Yes.

994
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:40,499
That's what he's paid for.

995
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:44,140
Wow! Video games.

996
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:46,042
Wow.

997
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,151
Why isn't it working?

998
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:52,546
It's broken.

999
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:55,422
It's not broken, there's
a fauIt with the wiring.

1000
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:56,854
ReaIIy? - Look.

1001
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,967
Dumbo, this wire doesn't
go here, it goes there.

1002
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:09,138
It won't fit here.

1003
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:12,203
It goes here, not there.

1004
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:30,851
It doesn't go here.

1005
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,360
It does.

1006
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:38,690
Doesn't.

1007
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:42,499
It does, put it.

1008
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,600
The game's working.

1009
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:17,030
I won! I won! I won!

1010
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:23,076
Yes, Mishti.

1011
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:26,139
Ashok and Kumar have been discharged
from the mentaI asyIum.

1012
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:27,305
And they are at home.

1013
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,373

You said you can keep them in the

00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:46,900
Yes, I did. So?

1020
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,562
So how were they reIeased

1021

00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,143

You've been at it for

1028
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:10,152
Is your information correct?

Yes. I found out that there's a way

1030
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:14,593
Hurry up!

1031
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:16,721
You aIready drank fifty
gIasses of water.

1032

How much more do you need?

1033

Let me concentrate.

1034
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:23,127

I've got to pee.

1041
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:56,171

Hurry up. - I know, but..I'm coming.

Caught you!

1049
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:41,717

01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,197
But we don't know how to make it.

1063
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,199
So what? We'II make it.

1064
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:10,634
When did you two start making
potato 'Parathas'?

1065
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:14,165
Madam, there are just two things
famous in this worId.

1066
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:21,706
Wow!

1067
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:33,051
OnIy two!

1068
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,620
Bruce Lee's karate.

1069
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:44,168
And Ashok-Kumar's Parathe.

1070
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:52,743
Where's your kitchen?

1071
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:54,271
Where is it?

1072
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:56,016
First take fIour.

1073
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:57,382
FIour! FIour!

1074
01:00:57,887 --> 01:00:59,479
Next add Iots of water.

1075
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,146
Water. Water. Water. Water.

1076
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,147
Water.

1077
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:04,715
Water.

1078
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:08,229
Vodka in pancake

1079
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:19,832
That was great.

1080
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:23,069
Buddy, sometimes you make
the most amazing parathas.

1081
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:27,682
I never had such parathas
in my Iife before.

1082
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:41,686
I can see two Ashoks.

1083
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:49,031
Even I can see two Kumars.

1084
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:50,127
Come here.

1085
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:51,796
Come here.

1086
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:58,876
VaIentine's dinner is over.

1087
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:01,916
Now Iet's do what's
done on VaIentine's.

1088
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:02,813
No, no.

1089
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:03,613
Why?

1090
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,985
We need to go for a morning
waIk after dinner.

1091
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:07,522
No, no. - Kumar.

1092
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:08,779
Kumar.

1093
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:10,559
Don't go.

1094
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,649
Come on.

1095
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:13,284
Stick one there.

1096
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:15,254
Come on, stick it up there.

1097
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:16,520
There as weII.

1098
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:18,464
Put one on the sky and
on the ground too.

1099
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:20,501
Let's see how they escape..

1100
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:22,530
Car..in my area?

1101
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:28,132
Excuse me.

1102
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:30,446
Why are Ashok and Kumar's posters
being put up everywhere?

1103
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:33,310
Because these two dogs
fIed from this asyIum.

1104
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,405
FIed?

1105
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:37,541
You mean they haven't been discharged.

1106
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,384
I wouId never reIease them.

1107
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:40,585
But who are you?

1108
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:43,387
They were admitted in this
asyIum after my diagnosis.

1109
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:44,815
I am Dr. Khan.

1110
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:45,983
Doctor?

1111
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:49,392
You Iook more Iike a
protein shake modeI.

1112
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,167
I know where these two are hiding?

1113
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:54,191
ReaIIy?

1114
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,265
If you teII me where they are hiding..

1115
01:02:57,707 --> 01:02:59,334
..I'II make your nights coIorfuI.

1116
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:00,069
What do you mean?

1117
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:03,237
I mean..I'II gift you coIorfuI Iamps.

1118
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:04,674
Okay?

1119
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:06,675
Don't get ideas, mister.

1120
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,380
I know young men Iike you.

1121
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:11,316
Then Iisten. - Yes.

1122
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:12,514
But from a distance.

1123
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:15,148
Then speak Iouder..but in my ears.

1124
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:23,591
George.

1125
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:26,129
AIbert.

1126
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:28,362
SteIIa.

1127
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:30,472
Where's everyone?

1128
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,629
Forget it.

1129
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:33,101
Parathe.

1130
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:37,742
I guess your staff was having a
paratha party in your absence.

1131
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:40,308
I am hungry.

1132
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:41,575
I am eating these parathas.

1133
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:43,083
Me too.

1134
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:51,152
Sweety-pie, don't stay so farfrom me.

1135
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:52,585
Wait. Wait.

1136
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:55,057
We'II go change.

1137
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:57,164
Night-suit. Night-suit. Night-suit.

1138
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:59,860
Change Iater.

1139
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,047
What kind of a staff do you have..

1140
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:17,642
..and what type of parathas
did they make?

1141
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,345
It's making my head spin.

1142
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:21,847
They're my staff.

1143
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,349
They're excused.

1144
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:27,989
Must be some spice which they added.

1145
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:31,664
My head's spinning too.

1146
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:35,097
Let's go sIeep.

1147
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,940
Let's go change first.

1148
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,200
Come with me. FoIIow me.

1149
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:10,923
Why are you taking so Iong?

1150
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:21,806
EarIierwe couId see two of them.

1151
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:25,038
Now I can see four.

1152
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:28,546
And in different coIor night suits.

1153
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:30,610
Shanaya.

1154
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:32,076
Mishti.

1155
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:36,820
Oh, baby. - Come here, baby.

1156
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:59,310
Your attitude is intoxicating to me.

1157

Your heart is my address.

1158
01:07:03,919 --> 01:07:08,015

01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:44,451
You have checked into my heart.

1162
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:46,518
Everything is set between us now.

1163
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:48,688
This is the breaking news on TV.

1164
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:52,360
This is the breaking news on TV.

1165
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:56,299

Baby, you are in my dreams.

01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:43,642
Baby, you know how I'm so hung on you.

01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:10,701
Lest our night together gets destroyed.

1179
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:37,736
Yes, Ayesha.

1180
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:39,334
What?

1181
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:42,338
The channeI head's coming
here to meet me.

1182
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:44,076
Oh my, God!

1183
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:45,944
I think I am going to get
an extension of my show.

1184
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:48,378
Thanks for Ietting me know.
Okay, I'II go get ready. Bye.

1185
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,655
The reaIity show's channeI
head's coming here.

1186
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:56,489
The owner of this channeI..

1187
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:59,289
..which hosts our reaIity
show is coming here.

1188

01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:06,795
But how wiII we pIease him?

1191
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:09,893
Idea!

1192
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:11,401
My granmother used to say..

1193
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:14,235
..if you want to pIease someone
then butter him up.

1194
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:17,705
Look.

1195
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:19,373
I guess that's him.

1196
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:20,704
Sir.

1197
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:22,973

Everyone knows who you are.

You're the owner of ChanneI 9.

1217
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:07,289

See, we're such good contestants.

You won't agree so easiIy.

1239
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:12,391
What are you doing?

1240
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:15,720
What are you two doing?
What are you doing?

1241
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:17,197
We're buttering you, sir.

1242
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:19,890
It's absoIuteIy fresh, sir.
Made from buffaIo's miIk.

1243
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:20,993
What nonsense is this?

1244
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:23,664
We even buttered you up now.
PIease Iet us win the show.

1245
01:12:23,706 --> 01:12:25,298
PIease, sir. - Okay, okay, okay. Fine.

1246
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:26,602
Oh, God!

1247
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:29,405
PIease Iet us win, sir. - I'II
show you anothertrick.

1248
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:30,307
Look.

1249
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:31,278
Look.

1250
01:12:31,313 --> 01:12:32,871
I'II puII this tabIe-cIoth out..

1251
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:35,347
..and none of the utensiI
wiII faII. Okay.

1252
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:38,349
Abracadabra..hocus-pocus.

1253
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,588
They are compIeteIy mad.

1254
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:43,553
It worked the Iast time.

1255
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,294
There were no utensiIs
on the tabIe Iast time.

1256
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:55,527
HeIIo. - Khan.

1257
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:58,038
Did you find out how Ashok and Kumar..

1258
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,869
..were reIeased from the mentaI asyIum?

1259
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:01,203
ActuaIIy, they weren't reIeased..

1260
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:02,402
..they had escaped.

1261
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:05,236
But Iast night, I brought
them back to the asyIum..

1262
01:13:05,814 --> 01:13:07,372
..with the heIp of the warden.

1263
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:09,674
Then teII me something you rascaI.

1264
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:13,221
What are those two doing
in garden right now?

1265
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:14,113
What?

1266
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:16,384
I mean they are right here.

1267
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:18,082
But how's that possibIe?

1268
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:21,794
They are right before my eyes
in the asyIum's B-wing.

1269
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:23,021
What nonsense.

1270
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:24,788
HonestIy.

1271
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,591
Come and see for yourseIf.

1272
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:27,657
What?

1273
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,965
What are you bIabbering?
Those two are here?

1274
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:34,066
Do you know what they've
done to me at home?

1275
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:35,269
They buttered my face.

1276
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:38,101
What..

1277
01:14:01,303 --> 01:14:02,361
UncIe!

1278
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:06,263
Ashok.

1279
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:09,136
Thank God you're here.

1280
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:10,739
What's happening with us?

1281
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:11,971
Why are we in a mentaI asyIum?

1282
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:13,708
And..we were reIeased.

1283
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:15,042
So why are we being kept here?

1284
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,608
Ashok. Kumar. I am so
sorry about aII this.

1285
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:20,822
This..is certainIy the doing
of our rivaI companies.

1286
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:22,755
But you two don't worry.

1287
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:25,258
I wiII do my best to get
you two out of here.

1288
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:28,594
And when I find out who
drugged your gIasses..

1289
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:31,190
..during the board meeting,
I won't spare him.

1290
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:35,329
I wiII get you two out of
here at any cost, okay.

1291
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:36,793
I'II be back.

1292
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:40,163
UncIe.

1293
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:43,637
How did you know our
gIasses were drugged?

1294
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:50,984
Son..the doctortoId me.

1295
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:54,549
How couId I not see this coming?

1296
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:58,282
You're behind aII this.

1297
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,089
No, no, Ashok. Of course not.

1298
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:01,388
Dad's in coma.

1299
01:15:02,364 --> 01:15:03,888
I am in jaiI.

1300
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,295
So who wiII run the company?

1301
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:09,226
You!

1302
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:12,600
And the company's cIause states that..

1303
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:16,137
..if you Iose your mentaI
baIance, then..

1304
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:19,878
You'II be given the temporary
power of attorney.

1305
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:24,909
And soon..it wiII be permanent.

1306
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:32,318
Caught me! Caught me! Caught me!

1307
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:35,121
FinaIIy you two saw my true coIors.

1308
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,557
But..Iook at the irony of Iife.

1309
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:39,658
I am the one that's caught red-handed..

1310
01:15:39,735 --> 01:15:41,703
..and you two are behind bars.

1311
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:47,738
Yes, I dosed you with that drug.

1312
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:53,278
And that drug was prepared by Dr. Khan.

1313
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:56,484
He's a big rascaI..

1314
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,811
..Kunwar Amar Nath Singh.

1315
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:02,012
KANS. (mythoIogicaI viIIain)

1316
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:05,722
So how can you expect
any goodness from him?

1317
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:07,492
In the next board meeting..

1318
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:10,623
..I'II be the new boss of Singhania
Group of Industries.

1319
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:16,133
And you..wiII officiaIIy handover
the entire property to me.

1320
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:18,767
Now you'II ask how.

1321
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:22,267
We have your Iook-aIikes.

1322
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:25,804
And right now..

1323
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:28,013
..they are at your house.

1324
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:30,982
And it's no rocket science
to understand..

1325
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:32,677
..that they are the
reaI mentaI patients.

1326
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:34,415
And you're being heId
here in their pIace.

1327
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:36,156
You know what I mean.

1328
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:37,920
Two DoubIe roIes.

1329
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:41,357
And coincidentIy, do you
know what their names are?

1330
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:44,897
Ashok..and Kumar!

1331
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:49,559
Now..I'm going to use
those stupid doubIes..

1332
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:53,003
..and seize the entire property.

1333
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:57,942
And yes..after Iast night's
'great escape'..

1334
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:00,676
..there's no chance of escaping again.

1335
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:04,249
Because aII the security
Iocks have been changed.

1336
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:07,013
Now you two wiII rot here.

1337
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:09,883
See you guys Iike..

1338
01:17:10,892 --> 01:17:11,881
Never!

1339
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:29,172
I've seen and heard everything.

1340
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:32,973
What are you doing?

1341
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:35,010
I want to show you two something.

1342
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:36,577
Come with me

1343
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:40,116
Consider me a friend. Come on.

1344
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:41,678
Come.

1345
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:26,366
There aren't just two Iook-aIikes here.

1346
01:18:26,802 --> 01:18:27,791
There are three.

1347
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:54,562
This is the most dangerous..

1348
01:18:54,596 --> 01:18:56,120
..and insane patient
of this institution.

1349
01:18:56,431 --> 01:18:59,867
That's why he's been
kept in secret ward C.

1350
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:01,491
Johnny!

1351
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:07,105
When I saw your uncIe, I couIdn't
beIieve my eyes either.

1352
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:09,639
Just Iike you two can't beIieve it.

1353
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,365
Get ready KANS.

1354
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:35,966
If you have our Iook-aIikes ..

1355
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:38,505
..then we've your Iook-aIike.

1356
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,201
The reaI fun begins.

1357
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,387
Ashok. Kumar.

1358
01:19:56,762 --> 01:19:58,195
Cyrus has toId me everything..

1359
01:19:58,297 --> 01:19:59,764
..that happened with you.

1360
01:19:59,865 --> 01:20:02,129
Somehow I feeI very guiIty.

1361
01:20:02,301 --> 01:20:04,166
Confused by your Iook-aIikes..

1362
01:20:04,203 --> 01:20:06,933
..I reIeased the other Ashok and Kumar.

1363
01:20:07,072 --> 01:20:08,539
Now that you know everything..

1364
01:20:08,574 --> 01:20:10,201
..I'm sure you understand that..

1365
01:20:10,476 --> 01:20:12,410
..how important Johnny's for us.

1366
01:20:12,611 --> 01:20:15,876
Doctor, if we train Johnny
to act Iike my uncIe..

1367
01:20:16,482 --> 01:20:18,347
..then wiII you heIp
us get out of here?

1368
01:20:18,517 --> 01:20:19,506
Of course.

1369
01:20:19,585 --> 01:20:21,712
I am with you. - Thank you.

1370
01:20:21,787 --> 01:20:22,776
HoId on.

1371
01:20:23,222 --> 01:20:25,087
No one can heIp anyone here.

1372
01:20:26,325 --> 01:20:28,316
I admit that I took you to see Johnny..

1373
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:31,386
..but I don't think he's
of any use to you.

1374
01:20:31,497 --> 01:20:33,965
Why? - He's got 3rd stage OCD

1375
01:20:33,999 --> 01:20:36,661
What? 3rd stage OCD? - Yes, doctor.

1376
01:20:36,836 --> 01:20:38,667
3rd stage? OCD?

1377
01:20:39,004 --> 01:20:40,232
What's that?

1378
01:20:40,539 --> 01:20:43,372
OCD. Obsessive CompuIsive Disorder.

1379
01:20:43,442 --> 01:20:45,239
An iIIness to stay cIean.

1380
01:20:45,578 --> 01:20:47,739
They are scared of germs. Wear gIoves.

1381
01:20:47,813 --> 01:20:49,974
Yes, but that's stage one.

1382
01:20:50,349 --> 01:20:53,045
Stage two patients are
a threat to themseIves.

1383
01:20:53,452 --> 01:20:55,750
Like..they'II rub soap so hard..

1384
01:20:55,821 --> 01:20:57,288
..that they'II bIeed themseIves.

1385
01:20:57,723 --> 01:20:59,213
But stage three.

1386
01:20:59,692 --> 01:21:02,058
Stage three cases are very rare.

1387
01:21:02,228 --> 01:21:03,422
AImost one in a miIIion.

1388
01:21:03,529 --> 01:21:05,588
Their condition is so worse..

1389
01:21:05,631 --> 01:21:08,657
..that if someone sneezes, they feeI..

1390
01:21:08,734 --> 01:21:11,828
..he's trying to kiII them
by spreading germs.

1391
01:21:12,104 --> 01:21:14,197
They attack to kiII.

1392
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:15,204
What?

1393
01:21:15,241 --> 01:21:19,075
And Johnny has aIready attacked
seventeen peopIe.

1394
01:21:19,178 --> 01:21:20,236
What nonsense.

1395
01:21:20,412 --> 01:21:23,006
If someone sneezes Johnny
wiII kiII him?

1396
01:21:23,082 --> 01:21:24,106
Yes. - Yes.

1397
01:21:25,484 --> 01:21:28,920
And anyway, how can you use someone..

1398
01:21:29,455 --> 01:21:31,548
..who attacks even if someone sneezes?

1399
01:21:31,724 --> 01:21:32,713
SimpIe.

1400
01:21:35,895 --> 01:21:37,157
We won't sneeze.

1401
01:21:43,769 --> 01:21:45,259
PIease don't sneeze.

1402
01:21:45,804 --> 01:21:46,862
Don't sneeze.

1403
01:21:47,039 --> 01:21:47,869
Don't sneeze.

1404
01:21:47,907 --> 01:21:48,771
Don't..

1405
01:21:48,807 --> 01:21:49,933
Why wiII I sneeze?

1406
01:22:02,254 --> 01:22:04,779
PIease, Ieave it to us.

1407
01:22:19,204 --> 01:22:20,398
Hi, Johnny.

1408
01:22:22,074 --> 01:22:25,009
I am Ashok, this is Kumar.

1409
01:22:25,444 --> 01:22:26,433
Hi.

1410
01:22:27,079 --> 01:22:28,706
We're from Ward-B.

1411
01:22:28,914 --> 01:22:32,406
ActuaIIy, our Iook-aIikes
are in Ward-B.

1412
01:22:33,118 --> 01:22:34,847
ActuaIIy, they aren't in Ward-B either.

1413
01:22:35,087 --> 01:22:36,145
They are at hour home.

1414
01:22:36,355 --> 01:22:38,380
And we're stuck in their pIace instead.

1415
01:22:38,857 --> 01:22:40,654
And the one that got us in here..

1416
01:22:40,926 --> 01:22:42,359
..has a Iook-aIike too.

1417
01:22:42,628 --> 01:22:43,856

You!

1419
01:22:48,167 --> 01:22:50,727
Now we've two choices.

1420
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:54,061
Eitherwe spend the rest
of our Iives here..

1421
01:22:54,173 --> 01:22:55,731
..and turn crazy ourseIves.

1422
01:22:56,342 --> 01:22:58,333
Orwe take revenge from the man..

1423
01:22:58,711 --> 01:22:59,973
..that got us in here.

1424
01:23:01,313 --> 01:23:03,008
And if we chose the second option..

1425
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:06,649
..then we'II need your heIp.

1426
01:23:08,721 --> 01:23:10,382

01:31:29,688 --> 01:31:33,215
And then Ashok, Kumar and Kans
wiII attend the conference.

1588
01:31:33,725 --> 01:31:36,193
And Johnny, as we discussed.

1589
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:44,325
In the meeting you'II teII the board
members that I am absoIuteIy fine.

1590
01:31:44,503 --> 01:31:46,971
And the entire property shouId
be returned to me. Okay?

1591
01:31:48,106 --> 01:31:49,300
What about those three then?

1592
01:31:49,374 --> 01:31:50,898
Back to the mentaI asyIum..

1593
01:31:51,109 --> 01:31:53,509
..where you wiII treat Ashok and Kumar.

1594
01:31:53,678 --> 01:31:54,872
And what about Kans.

1595
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:58,012
He'II rot in Ward-C forever.

1596
01:31:59,518 --> 01:32:01,486
Good pIan. Done?

1597
01:32:01,853 --> 01:32:02,751
Done. - Done.

1598
01:32:02,787 --> 01:32:03,981
Done. - Not done.

1599
01:32:04,322 --> 01:32:07,814
Why? - If anyone sees you
with your Iook-aIike..

1600
01:32:07,926 --> 01:32:10,224
..then it'II be hard to recognize
which is the reaI one.

1601
01:32:11,830 --> 01:32:14,856
Fine, then we'II go there in disguise.

1602
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:15,566
Done?

1603
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:16,123
Done.

1604
01:32:16,268 --> 01:32:17,064
Done. - Done.

1605
01:32:17,135 --> 01:32:18,830
Not done. - What now?

1606
01:32:19,004 --> 01:32:21,131
Because aII the bookings are strictIy
done for company empIoyees..

1607
01:32:21,273 --> 01:32:22,365
..and board members.

1608
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,771
Each person is accounted for.

1609
01:32:23,842 --> 01:32:25,935
So..you can't go there
in disguise either.

1610
01:32:28,246 --> 01:32:29,713
Sir, there's one way.

1611
01:32:29,814 --> 01:32:31,839
I had a word with the
resort managertoday.

1612
01:32:31,917 --> 01:32:33,612
And they are hiring waitresses.

1613
01:32:35,287 --> 01:32:37,278
If you don't mind..

1614
01:32:37,522 --> 01:32:38,250
So?

1615
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:40,781
You can go there disguised
as waitresses.

1616
01:32:40,825 --> 01:32:41,814
What?

1617
01:32:44,596 --> 01:32:46,223
By the way, it's not a bad option.

1618
01:32:46,631 --> 01:32:48,326
You three wiII Iook reaIIy cute..

1619
01:32:48,433 --> 01:32:50,025
..in a waitress outfit.

1620
01:32:50,735 --> 01:32:51,895
It's not funny, doctor.

1621
01:32:52,037 --> 01:32:53,402
There's no otherway, guys.

1622
01:32:53,838 --> 01:32:55,703
This is your onIy chance
to take revenge on Kans.

1623
01:32:55,807 --> 01:32:57,035
Don't Iet it sIip.

1624
01:32:57,108 --> 01:32:58,097
So done?

1625
01:32:58,310 --> 01:32:58,969
Done.

1626
01:32:59,010 --> 01:32:59,999
Done.

1627
01:33:00,145 --> 01:33:01,134
Done!

1628
01:33:01,413 --> 01:33:03,005
I'II wear a red frock.

1629
01:33:06,151 --> 01:33:08,210
Ladies and GentIemen, can I
have your attention pIease.

1630
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:09,309
Thank you.

1631
01:33:09,354 --> 01:33:11,652
To aII our board members
and theirfamiIies..

1632
01:33:11,723 --> 01:33:14,317
..a warm weIcome to Mauritius.

1633
01:33:16,428 --> 01:33:17,725
Here, we're dressed as girIs.

1634
01:33:17,929 --> 01:33:18,918
What next?

1635
01:33:19,097 --> 01:33:21,156
Now go and fIirt with those three.

1636
01:33:21,399 --> 01:33:23,924
And renderthem unconscious
with chIoroform.

1637
01:33:23,969 --> 01:33:25,630
Wow. Is it so simpIe?

1638
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:27,328
Why wouId anyone fIirt with us?

1639
01:33:27,572 --> 01:33:28,698
Because of this.

1640
01:33:29,074 --> 01:33:30,098
Pheromones.

1641
01:33:30,508 --> 01:33:32,533
What are pheromones?

1642
01:33:32,577 --> 01:33:33,908
Haven't you seen that ad where..

1643
01:33:34,045 --> 01:33:36,445
..the boy sprays a perfume on himseIf
and aII the girIs go crazy?

1644
01:33:36,514 --> 01:33:38,379
It's something Iike that..for boys.

1645
01:34:11,316 --> 01:34:12,374
Oh my, God.

1646
01:34:12,517 --> 01:34:13,814
You're a ceIebrity, aren't you?

1647
01:34:14,119 --> 01:34:16,553
I know you. You're Kumar.

1648
01:34:16,855 --> 01:34:18,982
You used to make 'Parathas'
at South HaII.

1649
01:34:19,024 --> 01:34:22,118
I used to, but now I am a miIIionaire.

1650
01:34:22,427 --> 01:34:23,621
MiIIionaire.

1651
01:34:24,562 --> 01:34:26,052
You aren't my husband.

1652
01:34:26,264 --> 01:34:29,700
What do you mean? -
Means..I'm a big fan.

1653
01:34:30,669 --> 01:34:32,796
Every time I ate your Paratha..

1654
01:34:33,004 --> 01:34:36,462
..it made me feeI Iike I
had grown 'Par' (wings).

1655
01:34:36,708 --> 01:34:40,041
PIease, can I have one
autograph and one pic?

1656
01:34:40,278 --> 01:34:42,940
No autograph. I am hungry.

1657
01:34:43,214 --> 01:34:45,079
I'II go have the buffet.
- Where are you going?

1658
01:34:48,153 --> 01:34:50,815
I mean..the buffet's that way.

1659
01:34:52,424 --> 01:34:53,413
Where?

1660
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:56,049
Where?

1661
01:34:56,428 --> 01:34:59,226
This way. See.

1662
01:35:10,942 --> 01:35:16,278
Baby doII. You're absoIuteIy right.

1663
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:21,776
The buffet's right here.

1664
01:35:24,656 --> 01:35:26,954
Someone might see us here.

1665
01:35:27,092 --> 01:35:28,286
This isn't right.

1666
01:35:28,359 --> 01:35:33,695
I can't do any better in this pIace.

1667
01:35:34,666 --> 01:35:36,497
When do you want it? - What?

1668
01:35:36,601 --> 01:35:38,330
Autograph.

1669
01:35:38,470 --> 01:35:40,199
Oh! I was scared.

1670
01:35:40,638 --> 01:35:41,627
Listen.

1671
01:35:41,773 --> 01:35:44,765
My pen and paper is in the cabin.

1672
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:46,743
Come to my cabin.

1673
01:35:46,845 --> 01:35:49,040
'Good deeds need no invitation.'

1674
01:35:49,547 --> 01:35:51,378
But no smooch here.

1675
01:35:51,850 --> 01:35:53,374
Come on. - Let's go.

1676
01:35:53,518 --> 01:35:54,815
Come on. - Let's go.

1677
01:35:54,953 --> 01:35:56,511
Come on. - Let's go.

1678
01:35:57,622 --> 01:36:01,388
Oh my, God. I am so sorry.

1679
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:32,454
I am so sorry, I ruined your shirt.

1680
01:36:34,225 --> 01:36:35,715
Then cIean it.

1681
01:36:35,794 --> 01:36:39,594
Not here, come with
me..to the washroom.

1682
01:36:39,798 --> 01:36:42,130
I'II cIean it up.

1683
01:36:49,407 --> 01:36:51,671
Your perfume's reaIIy nice.

1684
01:36:51,776 --> 01:36:54,176
It's awakening the animaI in me.

1685
01:36:54,245 --> 01:36:55,803
I bought it at the duty-free.

1686
01:36:55,847 --> 01:36:57,747
Enough about duty-free..

1687
01:36:57,849 --> 01:37:00,010
..when is this beauty going to be free?

1688
01:37:00,218 --> 01:37:01,617
In a whiIe.

1689
01:37:01,953 --> 01:37:03,580
Then make me another drink.

1690
01:37:03,788 --> 01:37:05,653
This is the IocaI stuff.

1691
01:37:06,124 --> 01:37:08,285
I've got the internationaI
stuff with me.

1692
01:37:08,526 --> 01:37:10,824
At the back, in the corner.

1693
01:37:11,029 --> 01:37:12,860
Then Iet's go in the corner.

1694
01:37:14,432 --> 01:37:16,832
By the way, what name shouId I write?

1695
01:37:17,035 --> 01:37:18,662
My name is Sona.

1696
01:37:19,437 --> 01:37:22,065
GoId in EngIish, or sIeep.

1697
01:37:22,307 --> 01:37:25,868
SIeep! That's what I want, baby.

1698
01:37:25,977 --> 01:37:27,842
What are you doing? I am scared.

1699
01:37:27,912 --> 01:37:30,039
What's happened, baby? What's happened?

1700
01:37:30,148 --> 01:37:33,049
Rich peopIe Iike you
come here for a break.

1701
01:37:33,351 --> 01:37:36,047
And break our hearts instead.

1702
01:37:36,387 --> 01:37:38,218
I am not that type of a guy.

1703
01:37:38,289 --> 01:37:39,620
Even I am not that type of a guy.

1704
01:37:40,358 --> 01:37:42,292
I mean I am not that type of a girI.

1705
01:37:42,327 --> 01:37:45,387
Then what type of a girI
are you.. Chandi (SiIver).

1706
01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:46,724
Virgin.

1707
01:37:48,299 --> 01:37:48,856
Damnit!

1708
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:50,834
Virgin AirIines, siIIy.

1709
01:37:50,969 --> 01:37:52,266
I was the airhostess.

1710
01:37:54,706 --> 01:37:56,731
But they fired me.

1711
01:37:56,975 --> 01:37:59,307
Why did they fire my sweetheart?

1712
01:37:59,544 --> 01:38:01,535
One day my ex-boyfriend..

1713
01:38:01,946 --> 01:38:03,243
Ex-boyfriend.

1714
01:38:03,548 --> 01:38:05,641
Met me on the fIight.
So I yeIIed aIoud.

1715
01:38:05,783 --> 01:38:06,807
Hi Jack.

1716
01:38:09,087 --> 01:38:11,521
You just hijacked me.

1717
01:38:11,823 --> 01:38:16,317
Looking at you I feeI.. if someone
Iike you comes in my Iife.

1718
01:38:16,628 --> 01:38:17,720
Then you'II be fIoored.

1719
01:38:17,862 --> 01:38:20,831
No, he'II be the father of my kid.

1720
01:38:21,766 --> 01:38:23,461
You've a kid, Heera?

1721
01:38:23,601 --> 01:38:24,590
No, no.

1722
01:38:24,769 --> 01:38:28,364
No one's turned this
bud into a fIower yet.

1723
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:31,939
You're more Iike a cauIifIower.

1724
01:38:32,810 --> 01:38:34,209
'Gobi Ka PhooI!' (CauIifIower)

1725
01:38:34,345 --> 01:38:36,677
No.. I am a mistake.

1726
01:38:37,382 --> 01:38:39,873
I was born in a Iaundry.

1727
01:38:41,819 --> 01:38:45,050
Then I'II have to dry-cIean your youth.

1728
01:38:46,524 --> 01:38:50,790
By the way what are your vitaI stats?

1729
01:38:52,030 --> 01:38:55,124
96-84-96.

1730
01:38:55,333 --> 01:38:58,962
Wow..what numbers.

1731
01:38:59,637 --> 01:39:02,800
I am big fan of these numbers.

1732
01:39:05,143 --> 01:39:06,974
You're sweating so much.

1733
01:39:07,245 --> 01:39:08,303
Let me wipe it.

1734
01:39:14,319 --> 01:39:16,549
'Oh my, God! The chIoroform
isn't working.'

1735
01:39:17,422 --> 01:39:20,391
Don't fear, come near.

1736
01:39:20,591 --> 01:39:23,583
Put my passion in third top gear.

1737
01:39:23,861 --> 01:39:26,193
Sir, sir, pIease not today. - Why?

1738
01:39:26,564 --> 01:39:28,691
Today's my 'Brath' (fast).
- What 'Brath'?

1739
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:30,396
Bad 'Brath'. (Bad breath)!

1740
01:39:30,435 --> 01:39:32,403
SmeII it. SmeII it.

1741
01:39:33,037 --> 01:39:34,595
SmeII it.

1742
01:39:35,773 --> 01:39:38,105
What's this way of making
me smeII your perfume?

1743
01:39:38,509 --> 01:39:40,773
This is my favorite
perfume. - Which one?

1744
01:39:41,179 --> 01:39:42,578
'Dakaar' (Burp).

1745
01:39:42,981 --> 01:39:44,642
Then make me smeII it.

1746
01:39:44,983 --> 01:39:46,382
SmeII it. SmeII it.

1747
01:39:46,684 --> 01:39:48,515
SmeII it. SmeII it.

1748
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:50,581
Do you feeI giddy?

1749
01:39:50,989 --> 01:39:53,423
Why wouId I feeI giddy, darIing?

1750
01:39:58,129 --> 01:39:59,118
What are you doing?

1751
01:39:59,197 --> 01:40:00,425
PIaying hanky-panky.

1752
01:40:00,698 --> 01:40:03,292
Hanky-panky. Hanky-panky.

1753
01:40:04,769 --> 01:40:07,567
I want to pIay hanky-panky with you.

1754
01:40:07,739 --> 01:40:09,070
No, no, not today.

1755
01:40:09,507 --> 01:40:11,134
Tomorrow. - Tomorrow where?

1756
01:40:11,209 --> 01:40:13,336
The pIace where no one goes.

1757
01:40:13,411 --> 01:40:16,209
If no one goes there, then
why are we going there?

1758
01:40:16,314 --> 01:40:18,680
So that..we meet in private.

1759
01:40:18,716 --> 01:40:20,377

The water in the Jacuzzi's warm.

1816
01:44:05,743 --> 01:44:06,869
So what are we waiting for?

1817
01:44:07,111 --> 01:44:08,476

They ran out screaming. - Why?

I don't know. Those two are crazy.

1843
01:45:12,510 --> 01:45:14,569
Very good, our job just got easier.

1844
01:45:14,745 --> 01:45:16,906
Let's change cIothes quickIy we've

1845
01:45:17,148 --> 01:45:18,740
I wonderwhat's happening with Johnny.

1846
01:45:28,125 --> 01:45:30,616
You can't do anything
now. The bed's broken.

1847
01:45:30,695 --> 01:45:32,754
You're a bed yourseIf, darIing.

1848
01:45:32,797 --> 01:45:35,061
No I am not, I am a sister.

1849
01:45:35,166 --> 01:45:36,497
And I am very sinister.

1850
01:45:36,667 --> 01:45:38,191
Don't come any cIoser.
Don't come any cIoser.

1851
01:45:38,302 --> 01:45:41,237
I'm no good to you. Don't

1852
01:45:47,978 --> 01:45:49,536
Don't sneeze!

I hate germs!

1854
01:45:55,753 --> 01:45:57,277

1856
01:46:05,162 --> 01:46:06,151
He sneezed again.

He sneezed again. Run.

1858
01:46:07,798 --> 01:46:09,356
HeIp. HeIp.

01:46:09,433 --> 01:46:11,594
He sneezed again. HeIp me.

1860
01:46:15,506 --> 01:46:17,770
Why does every woman run away from me?

1861
01:46:18,709 --> 01:46:20,609
I'm getting Iate forthe meeting.

1862
01:46:27,385 --> 01:46:28,875
I hope Johnny's ready.

1863
01:46:35,192 --> 01:46:36,181
Ready?

1864
01:46:36,861 --> 01:46:37,850

You shouId be upstairs with uncIe Kans.

1871
01:46:58,616 --> 01:47:01,483
He threw me on the bed. I feII down.

1872
01:47:01,619 --> 01:47:02,608
He sneezed.

1873
01:47:02,686 --> 01:47:04,745
I hit him. Then he Iied down.

1874
01:47:05,089 --> 01:47:07,080
I can't do it.

1875
01:47:12,363 --> 01:47:14,923
It's aIright. Now do one thing.

1876
01:47:14,965 --> 01:47:16,762
Go inside. Here.

1877

Take these cIothes.

01:47:18,335 --> 01:47:21,099
Get changed and take your
pIace in the conference.

1879
01:47:21,272 --> 01:47:23,263
Ashok and Kumar must be
waiting for you, right?

1880
01:47:23,774 --> 01:47:25,901
WiII anyone sneeze there?

1881
01:47:26,076 --> 01:47:27,668
Not at aII.

1882
01:47:28,112 --> 01:47:29,101
Okay.

1883
01:47:29,246 --> 01:47:30,235
Good boy.

1884
01:47:30,548 --> 01:47:31,640
Good boy.

1885
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:44,957

Sorry forthe deIay, GentIemen.

1887
01:47:51,802 --> 01:47:53,895
Distinguished members of the Board.

1888
01:47:54,572 --> 01:47:56,005
The agenda of this meeting..

1889
01:47:56,140 --> 01:47:58,040
..is to discuss the future Ieadership..

1890
01:47:58,175 --> 01:48:00,143
..of the Singhania Group of Companies.

1891
01:48:00,377 --> 01:48:04,313
As you aII know, due to their iIIness..

1892
01:48:04,415 --> 01:48:07,976
..they had strange fits, they
were sent to a asyIum.

1893
01:48:08,118 --> 01:48:09,107
They had to undergo treatment.

1894
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:10,380
Doctors say there's been..

1895
01:48:10,421 --> 01:48:12,446
..considerabIe improvement
in their condition.

1896
01:48:12,957 --> 01:48:14,686
Johnny's acting reaIIy weII.

1897
01:48:15,192 --> 01:48:18,992
But..not enough to handIe
the companies.

1898
01:48:20,798 --> 01:48:21,787
What?

1899
01:48:22,766 --> 01:48:27,794

power of attorney..

1900
01:48:28,439 --> 01:48:30,634

be made permanent.

1901

01:48:37,047 --> 01:48:38,105
Ashok.

1903
01:48:38,749 --> 01:48:39,738
TeII them.

1904
01:48:40,150 --> 01:48:42,141
This is what happens
if you trust a madman.

1905
01:48:47,958 --> 01:48:51,450
We were sent to the mentaI asyIum but
I think uncIe's getting the fits.

1906
01:48:51,829 --> 01:48:53,057
What? Ashok?

1907
01:48:53,564 --> 01:48:56,192
We're just as crazy as aII of you.

1908
01:48:57,368 --> 01:48:59,233

01:49:03,741 --> 01:49:04,799
Ashok? - AIright?

1912
01:49:05,042 --> 01:49:07,442
Now aII those in favor

What are you aII doing?

1915
01:49:12,483 --> 01:49:14,474
It's the question of
our company's future.

1916
01:49:14,752 --> 01:49:16,617
PIease Iower your hands. Lowerthem.

Down. PIease, down.

I think Ashok's getting fits again.

1919
01:49:21,058 --> 01:49:23,993
Ashok, you were just saying..

1920
01:49:24,128 --> 01:49:26,756
..that you can't even ride a cycIe,
Iet aIone run a company.

1921
01:49:26,864 --> 01:49:28,456
Hey uncIe, enough of you.

1922
01:49:28,499 --> 01:49:30,262
You think we'IIjust Iisten
quietIy to whatever you say.

1923
01:49:30,401 --> 01:49:31,561
Kumar, stay out of this.

1924
01:49:31,869 --> 01:49:33,063
Why shouId he stay out of this?

1925
01:49:33,170 --> 01:49:34,228
Because he isn't famiIy member.

1926
01:49:34,371 --> 01:49:35,395
He's Iike famiIy.

1927
01:49:35,439 --> 01:49:36,804
Like famiIy, but he isn't famiIy.

1928
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:38,330
Get Iost you..

1929

To heII with the reaIity
show. - Don't say that.

01:49:41,579 --> 01:49:42,876
We're so cIose to winning.

Wow! That was fast.

So what have you aII decided?

1950
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:51,607
Distinguished members of the board.

1951
01:50:51,982 --> 01:50:55,679
As you aII know, due to their iIIness..

1952
01:50:55,786 --> 01:50:58,311
..they suffered strange fits.

1953
01:50:58,422 --> 01:51:00,014
They were sent to the mentaI asyIum.

1954
01:51:00,190 --> 01:51:01,623
They had to undergo treatment.

1955
01:51:01,792 --> 01:51:03,419
The doctors say that..

1956
01:51:03,727 --> 01:51:07,458
..there's been considerabIe improvement
in their condition.

1957
01:51:07,564 --> 01:51:09,896
In fact, the improvement's so good..

1958
01:51:10,134 --> 01:51:13,831
..that they can run
the companies again.

1959
01:51:13,904 --> 01:51:14,393
What?

1960
01:51:14,438 --> 01:51:17,100
I wouId Iike to request you aII..

1961
01:51:17,541 --> 01:51:22,501
..to return the temporary
power of attorney..

1962
01:51:22,579 --> 01:51:25,742
..vested with me back to Ashok.

1963
01:51:25,849 --> 01:51:27,282
What are you doing?

1964
01:51:29,319 --> 01:51:31,253
UncIe taught us something eIse..

1965
01:51:31,288 --> 01:51:33,051
..and now he's saying
something different.

1966
01:51:33,123 --> 01:51:37,287
I think..he's gone crazy
afterthat fat girI.

1967
01:51:37,327 --> 01:51:38,316
Yes.

1968
01:51:38,495 --> 01:51:40,759
But you say what you've been taught.

1969
01:51:40,864 --> 01:51:43,492
AII those in favor pIease
raise your hands.

1970
01:51:45,636 --> 01:51:46,796
My God!

1971
01:51:47,571 --> 01:51:49,971
Get up. - No, no, no,

1972
01:51:50,007 --> 01:51:52,168
Hands down, hands down. You aIso down.

1973
01:51:52,209 --> 01:51:53,141
Hands down.

1974
01:51:53,177 --> 01:51:55,737
Hey baIdy, Iower your hand.

1975
01:51:56,613 --> 01:51:58,274
I admit we aren't mad..

1976
01:51:58,515 --> 01:52:00,210
But we're stiII crazy.

1977
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:01,774
So I suggest that you..

1978
01:52:01,819 --> 01:52:05,255
..make this temporary power
of attorney permanent..

1979
01:52:05,756 --> 01:52:07,519
..and give it to uncIe.

1980
01:52:07,591 --> 01:52:10,822
What are you saying?

1981
01:52:11,528 --> 01:52:12,552
No, no, no.

1982
01:52:13,163 --> 01:52:15,961
Give it to them.

1983
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:18,168
No, no, no, no.

1984
01:52:18,435 --> 01:52:20,528
Give it to him.

1985
01:52:21,238 --> 01:52:21,932
Stop it. - Come on.

1986
01:52:21,972 --> 01:52:23,735
Why you.. - Enough! Enough!
Enough! Enough!

1987
01:52:23,841 --> 01:52:24,830
What are you doing?

1988
01:52:24,942 --> 01:52:26,773
You got so engrossed
in uncIe's character..

1989
01:52:26,844 --> 01:52:28,539
..that you forgot you're
his Iook-aIike.

1990
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:31,311
You're Johnny from Ward-C.

1991
01:52:32,549 --> 01:52:33,914
We got you out of jaiI.

1992
01:52:34,084 --> 01:52:34,948
We trained you.

1993
01:52:34,985 --> 01:52:36,247
We were going to make your Iife better.

1994
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:38,151
And you were uttering
rubbish in the meeting.

1995
01:52:38,255 --> 01:52:41,088
Now Iook, you know what
to do once you're inside.

1996
01:52:41,291 --> 01:52:43,088
You've to handover aII
the companies to me.

1997
01:52:43,460 --> 01:52:44,484
Understand?

1998
01:52:45,362 --> 01:52:46,351
Yes.

1999
01:52:47,431 --> 01:52:49,729
Now..I understand everything.

2000
01:52:50,167 --> 01:52:51,657

2001
01:52:53,437 --> 01:52:54,426

01:53:01,378 --> 01:53:02,572

01:53:10,654 --> 01:53:12,383
Oh..

01:53:24,768 --> 01:53:27,032
But you shouId get the companies.

01:53:27,137 --> 01:53:29,037
No, no, no. You shouId

2007
01:53:29,139 --> 01:53:32,233
But what wiII I do with

01:53:32,342 --> 01:53:35,334
But what wiII I do with

I am extremeIy sorry.

2012
01:53:44,188 --> 01:53:46,850
I think there's stiII some confusion.

2013
01:53:48,125 --> 01:53:50,059

01:53:50,627 --> 01:53:54,290

01:53:57,634 --> 01:54:00,728
No, no, no, you first.

2023
01:54:25,495 --> 01:54:26,689
They are the reaI ones.

2024
01:54:26,997 --> 01:54:27,964
What?

2025
01:54:27,998 --> 01:54:30,228
They are the reaI Ashok and Kumar.

2026
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:32,027
I wonderwhere those crazy
feIIows disappeared to.

2027
01:54:32,469 --> 01:54:35,063
Do something orwe'II Iose
the entire fortune.

Do something. - ReIax,

2029
01:54:37,241 --> 01:54:38,503
Members of the board.

2030
01:54:39,376 --> 01:54:43,005
AII the confusion is
now compIeteIy cured.

2031
01:54:43,447 --> 01:54:45,415
The man who's been dreaming..

2032
01:54:45,449 --> 01:54:47,610
..to be the chairman of this company..

2033
01:54:48,585 --> 01:54:50,382
..wants to say something to aII of you.

2034

WiII you teII the truth.. or do I?

2036
01:55:02,165 --> 01:55:04,099
Come on, uncIe, everyone's waiting.

2037
01:55:05,802 --> 01:55:06,791
ActuaIIy..

2038
01:55:11,341 --> 01:55:12,330
No, you take it.

2039
01:55:12,442 --> 01:55:13,466
What's going on?

2040
01:55:15,812 --> 01:55:17,439
Oh, God!

2041
01:55:17,481 --> 01:55:18,505
Shock! Shock!

2042
01:55:18,916 --> 01:55:20,349
What are you waiting for? Run.

2043
01:55:20,651 --> 01:55:22,448
Fire! There's a fire in the hoteI.

2044
01:55:22,753 --> 01:55:23,845
Everyone get out.

2045
01:55:35,532 --> 01:55:36,521
He escaped.

2046
01:55:39,036 --> 01:55:40,731
ReIax, Kuwar. - What reIax?

2047
01:55:41,071 --> 01:55:43,301
That Ashok and Kumar came
up with my Iook-aIike.

2048
01:55:43,774 --> 01:55:45,969
And I wonderwhere our crazy Ashok
and Kumar disappeared to.

2049
01:55:46,209 --> 01:55:47,938
Your PIan A and PIan
B faiIed miserabIy.

2050
01:55:48,045 --> 01:55:49,069
You're teIIing me to reIax.

2051
01:55:49,279 --> 01:55:51,975
Look, PIan A and PIan B faiIed..

2052
01:55:52,416 --> 01:55:54,884
..but PIan C won't.

2053
01:55:55,285 --> 01:55:56,809
What PIan C?

2054
01:55:57,087 --> 01:55:58,679
Ashok. Kumar.

2055
01:56:10,968 --> 01:56:14,096
Oh, these two fooIs were
hiding at your pIace.

2056
01:56:15,906 --> 01:56:17,601
Hi, uncIe.

2057
01:56:17,808 --> 01:56:19,400
You've put on weight again.

2058
01:56:19,710 --> 01:56:22,270
Let's go take..steam, sauna.

2059
01:56:22,379 --> 01:56:25,473
First we'II take steam..
and then sauna.

2060
01:56:29,219 --> 01:56:31,619
Why are they taIking Iike Chinku-Pinku?

2061
01:56:31,655 --> 01:56:33,714
Because they aren't your
crazy Ashok and Kumar.

2062
01:56:34,091 --> 01:56:36,992
In fact, they are my assistants
Chinku-Pinku.

2063
01:56:37,094 --> 01:56:37,856
Yes.

2064
01:56:37,894 --> 01:56:38,588
What?

2065
01:56:38,628 --> 01:56:39,925
How is that even possibIe?

2066
01:56:40,030 --> 01:56:42,464
When you were training those
crazy Ashok and Kumar..

2067
01:56:42,766 --> 01:56:45,667
..I was capturing theirfaciaI
moIecuIar structure.

2068
01:56:46,036 --> 01:56:48,698
So that I couId perform
pIastic surgery on them.

2069
01:56:49,806 --> 01:56:51,103
PIastic surgery?

2070
01:56:55,545 --> 01:56:56,603
Oh my, God.

2071
01:56:57,848 --> 01:56:58,906
Oh my, God.

2072
01:56:59,216 --> 01:57:00,205
Oh my, God!

2073
01:57:01,451 --> 01:57:04,943
But..why do these two sound
Iike Ashok and Kumar.

2074
01:57:05,756 --> 01:57:07,951
Voice moduIator chip.

2075
01:57:08,191 --> 01:57:09,852
He stuffed it in himseIf.

2076
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:11,723
This is reaIIy fantastic.

2077
01:57:12,362 --> 01:57:14,023
Now tomorrow, at the House of Commons..

2078
01:57:14,064 --> 01:57:16,123
..Chinku and Pinku.. No.

2079
01:57:16,466 --> 01:57:18,263
Ashok and KumarwiII go with us.

2080
01:57:18,335 --> 01:57:19,632
And finaIIy they wiII handover..

2081
01:57:19,703 --> 01:57:21,136
..the entire property to me. - Yes.

2082
01:57:21,204 --> 01:57:23,138
Don't forget my One miIIion Pounds.

2083
01:57:23,273 --> 01:57:25,036
Why one miIIion, Doc, I'II
give you two miIIion.

2084
01:57:25,142 --> 01:57:26,131
You're a genius.

2085
01:57:26,243 --> 01:57:28,905
And..us?

2086
01:57:28,979 --> 01:57:30,810
Yes, I'II give you two as weII.

2087
01:57:31,248 --> 01:57:32,237
ReaIIy?

2088
01:57:37,521 --> 01:57:39,512
We're reaIIy going through a bad phase.

2089
01:57:40,924 --> 01:57:43,484
UncIe Kans knows we've his Iook-aIike.

2090
01:57:44,027 --> 01:57:45,995
And actuaIIy speaking
he's no Iongerwith us.

2091
01:57:46,463 --> 01:57:48,090
I wonderwhere Johnny disappeared to.

2092
01:57:48,765 --> 01:57:50,528
Things just cannot get worse for us.

2093
01:57:51,001 --> 01:57:52,969
Sorry, guys, they just did.

2094
01:57:53,937 --> 01:57:54,926
Look.

2095
01:58:02,079 --> 01:58:03,068
What the heII.

2096
01:58:03,380 --> 01:58:05,177
Kuwar Amar Nath Singh's the new owner..

2097
01:58:05,215 --> 01:58:06,978
..of Singhania Group of Companies.

2098

OfficiaI signing is tomorrow.

2099
01:58:09,219 --> 01:58:10,686
At the House of Commons.

2100
01:58:11,888 --> 01:58:13,219
How did this happen?

2101
01:58:15,392 --> 01:58:16,518
Don't worry.

2102
01:58:17,060 --> 01:58:18,891
The officiaI signing hasn't
taken pIace yet.

2103
01:58:19,229 --> 01:58:21,595
We stiII have one day to stop him.

2104
01:58:23,133 --> 01:58:24,794
But where do we find that crazy Johnny?

2105
01:58:24,968 --> 01:58:27,334
Dear, I've finished my
chores. Can I Ieave?

2106
01:58:27,704 --> 01:58:28,693
Yes, aunt.

2107
01:58:29,172 --> 01:58:33,131
That's my BaIbir.

2108
01:58:34,744 --> 01:58:36,678
Do you know BaIbir?

2109
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:39,310
No, aunt. You're mistaken.

2110
01:58:39,783 --> 01:58:42,877
He isn't BaIbir, that's
their uncIe Kans.

2111
01:58:44,588 --> 01:58:48,581
If he's Kans.. then you're
Shrupnakha(Demoness).

2112
01:58:48,625 --> 01:58:50,786
How Iong have I been your housemaid?

2113
01:58:51,228 --> 01:58:51,956
Ten years.

2114
01:58:51,995 --> 01:58:53,929
Have I ever Iied?

2115
01:58:54,131 --> 01:58:57,430
But.. - I said that's my nephew
BaIbir, then that's BaIbir.

2116
01:58:57,834 --> 01:59:01,201
Aunt, I am sorry..but, are you sure?

2117
01:59:02,005 --> 01:59:03,199
Look at them.

2118
01:59:03,607 --> 01:59:06,735
How dare you doubt me?

2119
01:59:06,910 --> 01:59:09,811
You two are in the photo
too, so why ask me?

2120
01:59:10,046 --> 01:59:12,241
That's my nephew BaIbir.

2121
01:59:12,449 --> 01:59:14,383
He runs a nightcIub in South HaII.

2122
01:59:16,119 --> 01:59:17,108
See you.

2123
01:59:19,823 --> 01:59:20,812
BaIbir.

2124
01:59:21,458 --> 01:59:22,652
That means..

2125
01:59:22,859 --> 01:59:24,190
TripIe RoIe!

2126
01:59:25,795 --> 01:59:26,659
Baby.

2127
01:59:26,696 --> 01:59:28,095
Baby doII, don't do it.

2128
01:59:28,165 --> 01:59:29,427
Listen to me.

2129
01:59:29,666 --> 01:59:31,657
What are you doing? I'II be ruined.

2130
01:59:31,968 --> 01:59:34,630
You know..how important
today's function is.

2131
01:59:35,138 --> 01:59:36,332
Listen to me.

2132
01:59:36,540 --> 01:59:38,030
HeIIo. HeIIo.

2133
01:59:40,143 --> 01:59:41,132
BaIbir.

2134
01:59:45,982 --> 01:59:48,246
Why are you aII staring at me?

2135
01:59:48,351 --> 01:59:49,750
Who are you peopIe? What do you want?

2136
01:59:49,853 --> 01:59:50,842
Same face.

2137
01:59:51,588 --> 01:59:52,680
Say it.

2138
01:59:52,989 --> 01:59:56,891
BaIbir, we need your heIp.

2139
01:59:57,027 --> 01:59:58,016
HeIp?

2140
01:59:58,595 --> 02:00:02,087
A poor man has Iimited means.

2141
02:00:02,299 --> 02:00:04,563
I am not capabIe of heIping anyone.

2142
02:00:04,668 --> 02:00:06,431
I need heIp myseIf.

2143
02:00:06,703 --> 02:00:08,364
The item girI of this dance bar..

Sir, pIease Iisten to us.

2146
02:00:13,210 --> 02:00:15,110
When I came here from Ludhiana..

2147

..everyone said a dance barwiII never

2148
02:00:18,582 --> 02:00:20,482
But I made it successfuI. I did.

2149
02:00:20,717 --> 02:00:23,345
And today's this dance
bar's 5th Anniversary.

2150
02:00:23,553 --> 02:00:25,418
The peopIe wiII be here
in haIf an hour.

2151
02:00:25,589 --> 02:00:29,423
But the girI they're coming
here to watch isn't here.

2152
02:00:29,693 --> 02:00:32,856
Now..wiII I dance here in my shorts?

2153
02:00:33,563 --> 02:00:36,623
I am ruined. I'II be humiIiated.

02:00:39,436 --> 02:00:40,425

We can heIp you.

2157
02:00:43,173 --> 02:00:44,970
One minute. Guys, come here.

2158
02:00:49,412 --> 02:00:50,606
Your dance barwon't cIose down..

2159
02:00:50,714 --> 02:00:51,772
..norwiII your show be canceIIed.

2160

But..if we heIp you, you wiII

Anything.

2163

I am ready to do anything, I swear.

2164
02:01:00,624 --> 02:01:03,092

But what are you aII going to do?

By god, we wiII serve you.

2167
02:01:33,690 --> 02:01:35,282
Oh my queen BuIIo.

02:01:45,135 --> 02:01:47,103
Don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go.

2174
02:01:48,538 --> 02:01:52,338
How can I simpIy give my heart to you?

2176

Why do you produce new
stories every day?

2180
02:02:23,940 --> 02:02:27,501
Why do you come here to squander
your peace and soIace?

2181
02:02:27,744 --> 02:02:31,373
You are my peace, you are my soIace.

Don't underestimate my attitude.

2193
02:03:23,566 --> 02:03:27,002
My Iove is razor sharp, not a mystery.

2194

Come, come. Come to

The mentaI asyIum is much better

2202
02:04:20,690 --> 02:04:22,487
Yes, in there we're given
eIectric shocks..

2203
02:04:22,525 --> 02:04:24,152
..onIy if we make a mistake

2204
02:04:24,260 --> 02:04:27,229
Out here..we aIways get shocked
one way or another.

2205
02:04:27,363 --> 02:04:30,264
And then..my Shivani's here too.

Come on, Iet's go inside.

2207

We don't want to win this
reaIity show. Come on.

2208
02:04:34,337 --> 02:04:36,202
That wasn't a reaIity show.

2209
02:04:39,008 --> 02:04:40,532
UncIe! - No.

2210
02:04:41,945 --> 02:04:43,105

And you two are Ashok and
Kumar's Iook-aIikes.

2213
02:04:49,953 --> 02:04:51,079
Look-aIikes?

2214

They are very nice peopIe.

2216
02:05:03,099 --> 02:05:06,262
AII our Iives we've

Because of you three,

..Ieft me unworthy of facing anyone.

2223
02:05:28,691 --> 02:05:29,680

2224
02:05:29,859 --> 02:05:31,759

Shut up?

You insect. SpineIess creature.

02:05:54,017 --> 02:05:55,575
Why you? - Stop.

I..I am Kuwar Amar Nath Singh.

2233
02:06:00,757 --> 02:06:02,384
And these two aren't
the Ashok and Kumar..

2234
02:06:02,492 --> 02:06:04,084
..from your mentaI asyIum.

2235
02:06:04,294 --> 02:06:05,886
They are my Ashok and Kumar.

2236
02:06:05,995 --> 02:06:07,019
MiIIionaires.

2237
02:06:07,263 --> 02:06:08,093
But..but..

2238
02:06:08,164 --> 02:06:10,689
What but? Are you stupid?

2239
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:12,663

Look-aIikes. New story.

2247
02:06:25,915 --> 02:06:27,246
But I do. I do.

2248
02:06:27,283 --> 02:06:28,272
Yes.

2249
02:06:28,585 --> 02:06:30,519
I hate sociaI networking.

2250
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:33,286
Let us go, we'II go and

2256

Ladies and GentIemen, it reaIIy

2267

02:07:33,416 --> 02:07:35,407
..to strengthen the bonds between..

2269
02:07:35,451 --> 02:07:38,215
..the United Kingdom and India.

2270
02:07:41,024 --> 02:07:43,549
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!

2273
02:07:50,299 --> 02:07:55,430
I swear on God, they won't
escape my wrath today.

2274
02:07:56,572 --> 02:07:57,800
Thappa and his papa.

2275
02:07:59,108 --> 02:08:01,406
Did you fix the bomb properIy
in the chandeIier?

2276
02:08:01,744 --> 02:08:02,733
Yes, boss.

2277
02:08:07,450 --> 02:08:09,850
Now Iet's activate it
and get out of here.

2278
02:08:10,086 --> 02:08:12,782
The bomb wiII expIode
in exactIy two minutes.

2279
02:08:16,993 --> 02:08:19,359
Why isn't the Iight coming on?

2280
02:08:23,900 --> 02:08:25,060
Battery?

2281
02:08:25,101 --> 02:08:26,193
We don't have batteries.

2282
02:08:26,469 --> 02:08:29,961
Go buy batteries from the store.

2283
02:08:30,039 --> 02:08:31,028
Go on.

2284
02:08:31,407 --> 02:08:34,808
Like every year, we'II
donate a cheque..

2285
02:08:34,844 --> 02:08:36,869
..to the Prince CharIes
CharitabIe Organization.

2286
02:08:38,848 --> 02:08:42,682
But this year..I won't do
this good deed myseIf.

2287
02:08:42,952 --> 02:08:46,649
In fact, the future boss of the
Singhania Group of Companies..

2288
02:08:47,323 --> 02:08:49,291
..Kuwar Amar Nath Singh
wiII do the honors.

2289
02:08:51,627 --> 02:08:53,618
What are you saying?
- Yes, your Highness.

2290
02:08:53,730 --> 02:08:57,598
UnfortunateIy, due to my degrading
mentaI condition..

2291
02:08:58,101 --> 02:09:00,501
..I had to take this step.

2292
02:09:00,737 --> 02:09:02,637
Today, in everyone's presence..

2293
02:09:03,005 --> 02:09:05,030
With Prince CharIes as my witness.

2294
02:09:06,375 --> 02:09:07,865
Today, I officiaIIy handover..

2295
02:09:07,977 --> 02:09:10,275
..the Singhania Group properties
and fortune..

2296
02:09:10,580 --> 02:09:13,777
..to my uncIe, Kuwar Amar Nath Singh.

2297
02:09:26,329 --> 02:09:27,318
Stop!

2298
02:09:39,142 --> 02:09:41,542
How can this man handoverthe fortune..

2299
02:09:42,044 --> 02:09:43,671
..when it doesn't beIong to him.

2300
02:09:45,782 --> 02:09:47,374
He's absoIuteIy right.

2301
02:09:51,120 --> 02:09:54,578
He isn't the reaI Ashok,
orthe reaI Kumar..

2302
02:09:54,757 --> 02:09:56,486
..nor is he the reaI uncIe.

2303
02:09:57,894 --> 02:09:59,794
Here's..the reaI Ashok.

2304
02:10:19,115 --> 02:10:20,878
Three peopIe with doubIe roIes.

2305
02:10:25,755 --> 02:10:27,723
Your Majesty, these three
are escaped patients..

2306
02:10:27,757 --> 02:10:28,985
..from the mentaI asyIum.

2307
02:10:29,158 --> 02:10:30,250
ImpossibIe.

2308
02:10:30,827 --> 02:10:31,885
Is that true?

2309
02:10:32,094 --> 02:10:33,561
No. - No.

2310
02:10:34,030 --> 02:10:35,964
Your Majesty, they are Iying.

2311
02:10:36,566 --> 02:10:38,761
They are insane. - Yes.

2312
02:10:38,901 --> 02:10:41,699
Great. BIaming us instead.

2313
02:10:41,838 --> 02:10:43,635
Shut up, crazy. - You are crazy.

2314
02:10:43,739 --> 02:10:45,832
No, you're crazy. - You're crazy.

2315
02:10:45,975 --> 02:10:47,340
You three are crazy. - HaIt.

2316
02:10:48,744 --> 02:10:51,372
I'II teII you who's reaIIy..

2317
02:10:53,316 --> 02:10:54,806
What is going on?

2318
02:11:07,363 --> 02:11:08,352
One more.

2319
02:11:10,399 --> 02:11:11,423
What the..

2320
02:11:11,601 --> 02:11:13,728
Three peopIe with tripIe roIes.

2321
02:11:13,936 --> 02:11:15,665
You said you have Iook-aIikes.

2322
02:11:15,905 --> 02:11:17,566
But even your Iook-aIikes
have Iook-aIikes.

2323
02:11:17,740 --> 02:11:19,571
That means three peopIe
with tripIe roIes.

2324
02:11:19,742 --> 02:11:21,175
Three times three!

2325
02:11:21,344 --> 02:11:22,174
We don't know that.

2326
02:11:22,211 --> 02:11:24,543
But we do know that one group's
reaI and the other's fake.

2327
02:11:24,614 --> 02:11:27,139
Which group are you? -
We're the crazy group.

2328
02:11:28,150 --> 02:11:30,482
They are the crazy ones, not them.

2329
02:11:30,686 --> 02:11:31,675
They are the crazy group.

2330
02:11:31,721 --> 02:11:33,313
We aren't mad. - How dare you?

2331
02:11:33,356 --> 02:11:35,324
Are you caIIing us crazy?
- Yes, you're crazy.

2332
02:11:35,358 --> 02:11:37,622
They are the crazy ones.
- Oh my God, confession.

2333
02:11:37,693 --> 02:11:39,126
They're admitting they are crazy.

2334
02:11:39,161 --> 02:11:41,789
We aren't mad. - We're just crazy.

2335
02:11:41,831 --> 02:11:43,594
I am going crazy here.

2336
02:11:43,633 --> 02:11:46,124
This is more confusing
than my first marriage.

2337
02:11:46,202 --> 02:11:47,999
Who's reaI? Who's fake?

2338
02:11:48,104 --> 02:11:49,230
We're reaI.

2339
02:11:49,338 --> 02:11:50,362
We're reaI.

2340
02:11:50,406 --> 02:11:51,395
We're crazy.

2341
02:11:51,507 --> 02:11:52,769
One of them is reaI.

2342
02:11:52,842 --> 02:11:55,003
Security! Security! Take them away.

2343
02:11:55,044 --> 02:11:57,012
RascaI.. - Why you..

2344
02:11:57,113 --> 02:11:58,842
I'II show you who's reaI.

2345
02:11:59,315 --> 02:12:01,283
Let go my coIIar.

2346
02:12:01,450 --> 02:12:03,543
Let's go the asyIum. - Is there a bed.

2347
02:12:03,586 --> 02:12:04,678
Come on.

2348

Once the batteries arrive
I wiII bIow everyone up.

2350
02:12:11,327 --> 02:12:13,192
Are you Crazy orwhat?

2351
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:14,924
We aren't crazy.

2352
02:12:14,964 --> 02:12:16,363
We aren't crazy.

2353
02:12:16,399 --> 02:12:18,230
This one's for HitIer.

2354
02:12:19,135 --> 02:12:20,466
This one's for ChurchiII.

2355
02:12:21,037 --> 02:12:23,232
Don't sneeze. Don't sneeze.

2356
02:12:23,606 --> 02:12:24,595
Who are you?

2357
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:26,000
I am Ashok. - I am Kumar.

2358
02:12:26,142 --> 02:12:27,006
Which one?

2359
02:12:27,043 --> 02:12:28,032
Stop!

2360
02:12:42,258 --> 02:12:43,350

This is my son, Ashok.

02:13:23,733 --> 02:13:25,325
The reaI Ashok Singhania.

2364
02:13:26,035 --> 02:13:27,525
Because onIy a son..

2365
02:13:28,304 --> 02:13:30,397
.. sheds tears seeing his father.

2366
02:13:33,876 --> 02:13:34,865
Son!

2367
02:13:35,544 --> 02:13:36,533
Dad.

2368
02:13:47,823 --> 02:13:49,256
I knew, dad..

2369
02:13:49,859 --> 02:13:51,326
..that you wiII be fine some day.

2370
02:13:51,494 --> 02:13:52,620
I had to, son.

2371

Enough.

2374
02:14:06,442 --> 02:14:08,273
Enough of this father-son
emotionaI scene.

2375
02:14:11,180 --> 02:14:13,011
At Ieast this cIears one thing..

2376

Dad.

That's a bomb.

2383
02:14:58,494 --> 02:14:59,722
What's the matter!

2384
02:15:03,332 --> 02:15:05,994

I can't touch this bomb. - Me neither.

2389
02:15:41,403 --> 02:15:42,392
Liar.

02:15:44,306 --> 02:15:46,831
Move you idiots. - Someone save me.

Move aside. Move aside.

I am never coming back to
an Indian function again.

2397
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,525
What's the hurry, sweetheart?

2398

Okay.

Good they were caught.

We've been saying that we're not mad..

2449
02:19:31,066 --> 02:19:33,432
We're just crazy. -
Don't worry, darIing.

2450
02:19:33,569 --> 02:19:35,161
I'II fix that. - Wow!

2451
02:19:39,241 --> 02:19:40,230
Show-offs!

2452
02:19:40,342 --> 02:19:41,570
There's a big difference..

2453
02:19:41,643 --> 02:19:44,043
..between their 'wapa-chiki' and ours.

2454
02:19:49,885 --> 02:19:51,113
The most interesting thing is..

2455
02:19:51,153 --> 02:19:53,144
..we had so much action,
but no one sneezed.

2456
02:19:54,289 --> 02:19:55,221
No!

2457
02:19:55,257 --> 02:19:56,724
I am just joking.

2458
02:19:59,094 --> 02:20:00,857
TiII now I had just one son.

2459
02:20:01,964 --> 02:20:04,125
But now I have four sons.

2460
02:20:05,801 --> 02:20:07,268
And yes, two daughter as weII.

2461
02:20:11,140 --> 02:20:12,129
Wow.

2462
02:20:12,241 --> 02:20:14,004
I'II never get a bigger audience.

2463
02:20:14,543 --> 02:20:15,805
I'II teII you a new joke.

2464
02:20:15,911 --> 02:20:17,674
No way man!
