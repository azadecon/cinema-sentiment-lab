1
00:01:56,758 --> 00:01:58,175
Grow up.

2
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,758
Sing a song that starts
with the letter 'M'.

3
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,675
- Hey, Insia has got her guitar out.
Quiet, everyone.

4
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,675
- Quiet, everyone.

5
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:10,133
<i>Secretly, quietly and with care</i>

6
00:03:10,217 --> 00:03:13,675
<i>Secretly, quietly and with care</i>

7
00:03:13,842 --> 00:03:17,883
<i>Patiently I picked a twig here
And a straw there</i>

8
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:20,633
<i>And built myself a dream</i>

9
00:03:22,758 --> 00:03:26,758
<i>With a stitch here and some knitting there</i>

10
00:03:26,842 --> 00:03:30,217
<i>With a stitch here and some knitting there</i>

11
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:32,175
<i>Collecting little patches</i>

12
00:03:32,258 --> 00:03:38,425
<i>I quilted myself a dream</i>

13
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:42,342
<i>Collecting little patches</i>

14
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:46,258
<i>I quilted myself a dream</i>

15
00:03:47,508 --> 00:03:51,050
<i>Oh dream, my dream</i>

16
00:03:51,217 --> 00:03:55,217
<i>Come alive, my dream</i>

17
00:03:55,717 --> 00:03:59,300
<i>Oh dream, my dream</i>

18
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:03,467
<i>Come alive, my dream</i>

19
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:26,967
Insia...

20
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:28,633
Is this a new song?

21
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:30,842
It's really nice. You wrote it?

22
00:04:31,258 --> 00:04:32,383
What are you doing here?

23
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,592
I have an announcement to make.

24
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:39,758
These are the flyers of an inter-school
cultural competition.

25
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:46,050
In every category,

26
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:49,675
the winner gets a laptop
and one year of free internet!

27
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,717
Let me see!

28
00:04:56,925 --> 00:04:59,342
And one more thing, all the best everyone.

29
00:05:34,425 --> 00:05:35,633
Did you have fun, dear?

30
00:05:35,717 --> 00:05:36,967
How was your trip?

31
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,467
I missed you so much.
Let me carry the bag.

32
00:05:47,258 --> 00:05:48,800
You know, on the show Singing Idol,

33
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:50,008
a little boy auditioned.

34
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,133
Shakti Kumaarr was so hard on him...
it was terrible!

35
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,217
What happened to your eyes?

36
00:05:56,717 --> 00:06:00,008
It's nothing.
I opened the kitchen cabinet,

37
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:01,717
and the door hit my eye.

38
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,842
You're right.

39
00:06:02,925 --> 00:06:04,508
I'm really stupid.

40
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:06,800
So, I was saying,

41
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:10,925
Shakti Kumaarr was so mean
that the poor kid broke down.

42
00:06:13,883 --> 00:06:14,967
I am right.

43
00:06:16,217 --> 00:06:17,425
You really are stupid.

44
00:07:01,717 --> 00:07:02,967
Insu!

45
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,675
Get away!
- Hello!

46
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,133
Hello.
- How was your outing?

47
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,175
Be quiet.
- Did you get me any gifts?

48
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:09,717
What gifts?

49
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,675
Two chocolates?

50
00:07:11,217 --> 00:07:12,800
No.
- One chocolate?

51
00:07:13,175 --> 00:07:15,133
Shut up.
- Not even one?

52
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:17,217
No!
- Insia!

53
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,675
Don't you have manners?

54
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:21,425
You didn't even greet me.

55
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,342
Greetings, Grand-aunt.

56
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:25,550
Greetings.

57
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:28,092
Why didn't you get me a gift?
- Get out of here!

58
00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:29,383
Gift... gift. Go!

59
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:33,300
Why are you screaming at Guddu?
- Guddu...

60
00:07:33,383 --> 00:07:35,925
Up to no good, this mother and daughter!

61
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,925
This one. No, this one.

62
00:08:00,925 --> 00:08:02,883
So, judges, what's your verdict?

63
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:07,508
Ten points just for cuteness.

64
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:11,717
Are we judging cuteness?

65
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,383
This is a singing show, Monali. Singing.

66
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:16,758
I know my job. I'm a judge, too.

67
00:08:16,842 --> 00:08:17,925
You are useless.

68
00:08:18,008 --> 00:08:19,508
He can't sing to save his life.

69
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:23,342
Kiddo, you're an insult to talent!

70
00:08:23,592 --> 00:08:25,925
You're an insult to talent!

71
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:28,133
What do you know about talent?

72
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,550
What are you looking at?

73
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:31,592
Now, get out!

74
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,800
<i>Friends, Mr. Shakti is well knownfor his anger.</i>

75
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:43,133
<i>And now it is rumoredthat his wife left him last month.</i>

76
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,258
<i>Obviously he's under stress</i>

77
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:48,425
<i>And frustrated.</i>

78
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:51,342
<i>Well, his marriage seems to be over,</i>

79
00:08:51,425 --> 00:08:53,217
<i>after the break
our astrologer will predict,</i>

80
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,467
<i>whether Salman will finallyget married this year.</i>

81
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,967
Oh, I completely forgot,

82
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,508
Glamour Awards is on TV tonight.

83
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,050
I remembered.

84
00:09:07,675 --> 00:09:09,467
Who do you think will win Best Singer?

85
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,133
I don't know. It's a tough one.

86
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:17,217
Best Music Composer?

87
00:09:18,842 --> 00:09:21,758
Anyone... but Shakti Kumaarr.

88
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,508
He has never won an award in any case.

89
00:09:25,175 --> 00:09:27,050
Earlier, he made such good songs.

90
00:09:27,925 --> 00:09:29,550
But nowadays, when I listen to his songs,

91
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:32,092
it feels like he has remixed
some really nice song,

92
00:09:33,092 --> 00:09:34,800
and that nice song never got made.

93
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:36,467
Mom...

94
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:37,592
Potty.

95
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:38,758
Wait for sometime.

96
00:09:39,675 --> 00:09:40,508
Come.

97
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,550
<i>Let's proceed to the next award,</i>

98
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:48,883
<i>which isthe 'Best Female Playback Singer'.</i>

99
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:50,925
<i>And the nominees for this award are:</i>

100
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:52,383
<i>Monali Thakur...</i>

101
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,550
Sudha Venkat will definitely win.

102
00:09:54,842 --> 00:09:56,217
No, Monali Thakur.

103
00:09:56,592 --> 00:09:57,800
Bet?
- Bet!

104
00:09:57,883 --> 00:10:00,842
Done.
- If I win, I can ask for anything.

105
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:01,967
Okay.

106
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:03,967
Mom, I'm done.

107
00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:06,842
He's done.

108
00:10:07,217 --> 00:10:08,133
I am coming.

109
00:10:08,217 --> 00:10:10,092
Push some more. There maybe some left.

110
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:12,383
<i>Shakti Kummarr!</i>

111
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:28,342
<i>I'm tired of receiving awards.</i>

112
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,217
<i>I'm tired.</i>

113
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:31,758
He'll blabber on now.

114
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:35,300
<i>So, this time I called
Glamour Awards and said, </i>

115
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:39,842
<i>"Glamour Award, this year Shakti
won't receive the award, he'll give it."</i>

116
00:10:39,925 --> 00:10:41,883
Mom!
- Yes?

117
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:42,883
I'm done.

118
00:10:42,967 --> 00:10:46,258
<i>So, here I am to give the award
for the Best Singer...</i>

119
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:48,050
<i>female.</i>

120
00:10:56,425 --> 00:10:58,342
<i>To my protÃ©gÃ©, whom I launched.</i>

121
00:10:58,883 --> 00:11:00,008
<i>Monali Thakur. </i>

122
00:11:01,217 --> 00:11:03,092
<i>Come, Mona. Come, babes.</i>

123
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:33,842
Keep loving me this way
and I'll keep singing such lovely songs.

124
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:35,258
Thank you so much.

125
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:39,008
Babes, you're singing
quite well these days.

126
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,967
<i>But, you've been only screaming
at little children nowadays.</i>

127
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,258
<i>Why don't you write some songs?</i>

128
00:11:47,342 --> 00:11:49,675
<i>Who are you to tell me what to do?</i>

129
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,383
<i>I've won the award, haven't I?</i>

130
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:53,258
<i>I think I've earned the right to speak.</i>

131
00:11:53,342 --> 00:11:54,508
<i>Why are you giving a speech?</i>

132
00:11:54,592 --> 00:11:55,925
<i>Have you won an award?</i>

133
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:57,592
<i>You used to sing jingles
for toothpaste ads,</i>

134
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,883
<i>I groomed you.</i>

135
00:11:59,383 --> 00:12:01,967
They are arguing on television.
They have no shame.

136
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,050
By the way, I won the bet.

137
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:07,508
Yes.

138
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:09,383
So, what do you want?

139
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,800
There's an inter-school
singing competition.

140
00:12:12,592 --> 00:12:13,467
Can I participate?

141
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:17,217
Okay. But, don't tell your father.

142
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:21,050
But, if I get selected for the finals
I will have to go to Mumbai.

143
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:22,175
No, Insu.

144
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:23,217
Then let it go.

145
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:26,092
Your father threatens to break
your guitar every now and then!

146
00:12:26,175 --> 00:12:27,508
He'll never allow it.

147
00:12:27,592 --> 00:12:29,383
You said I could ask for anything.

148
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:33,467
Insu, I said you can ask anything from me.

149
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:34,967
Not from life.

150
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:45,050
Listen, I have an idea.

151
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,342
What?
- Come here.

152
00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:49,258
Stop being so gloomy.

153
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,467
Tell me.

154
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:52,967
Your father will be home late.
- So?

155
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,383
He'll be tired and hungry.

156
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:58,717
Ask him this question, when he's eating.

157
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:00,133
He may agree.

158
00:13:00,217 --> 00:13:01,800
Good idea, Mom.

159
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:03,425
Which song should I sing?

160
00:13:03,758 --> 00:13:06,050
Song...
- Do you know what the first prize is?

161
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:08,133
A laptop and a year of free internet.

162
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:10,508
So, think of a good song.

163
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:11,967
Sing any song.

164
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,842
You'll win for sure.

165
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,633
You're my favorite singer.

166
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,592
Even better than Monali Thakur.

167
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,300
Really.

168
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,467
Go to sleep.

169
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,842
Salam, father.

170
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Can I expect to get some water
in this house?

171
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:36,758
Yes, Father.

172
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,925
How was your trip?

173
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,175
It was good, Father.

174
00:14:56,758 --> 00:14:59,300
Did you learn anything
or did you just waste your time?

175
00:14:59,717 --> 00:15:01,342
No, Father. It was good.

176
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,383
How are you?

177
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,217
Salam.

178
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,967
Father, there's this...

179
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:16,550
Father, there is a...

180
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:17,675
There's less salt.

181
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:18,675
What?

182
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:20,008
Come here.

183
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:21,550
Just coming.

184
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,092
Should I fill my stomach
with your apology?

185
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:32,717
Can a man not expect a decent meal
after working 17 hours?

186
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:42,592
Father...

187
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,175
Najma... Have you packed my bag?
- Yes?

188
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:46,800
Bag?

189
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:49,508
Are you Najma?
- I'm sorry, Father.

190
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:51,967
You are leaving day after, right?

191
00:15:57,842 --> 00:15:59,967
What did I say? When was I leaving?

192
00:16:02,217 --> 00:16:03,425
On the third.

193
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:04,925
What's the date today?

194
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,342
Today is the second.

195
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,425
What does that make tomorrow?

196
00:16:12,883 --> 00:16:15,175
I'm sorry.
- You forget the salt. You forget to pack.

197
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:16,758
Is there anything you remember?

198
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,342
I'm fed up of you.

199
00:16:25,883 --> 00:16:28,925
Say sorry once more,,
and it won't be the plate, it'll be you.

200
00:16:40,508 --> 00:16:41,800
You go inside, I'll clean it.

201
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:24,883
Mom, I think you should leave father.

202
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:29,383
He's not the right husband for you.

203
00:17:34,842 --> 00:17:36,050
Then who is?

204
00:17:36,467 --> 00:17:37,758
Shah Rukh Khan?

205
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,092
Mom, why don't you get it?

206
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:41,342
I'm not joking.

207
00:17:41,508 --> 00:17:43,550
Insu, I've told you a million times.

208
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:45,633
Who will take care of us?

209
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,592
There's your school fees...

210
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:49,258
We can't be depen on your grandfather.

211
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:50,342
Why grandfather?

212
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:52,092
Mom, trust me. I'll take care of us.

213
00:17:52,175 --> 00:17:53,092
Really?

214
00:17:53,425 --> 00:17:54,633
What's your plan?

215
00:17:54,883 --> 00:17:56,133
Just trust me, Mom.

216
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:59,925
Tell me, isn't the destination
decided first and then the route later?

217
00:18:01,342 --> 00:18:02,717
Did the chicken come first or the egg?

218
00:18:03,342 --> 00:18:04,175
What?

219
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,592
Did the chicken come first or the egg?

220
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:09,967
It depends on the situation.

221
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:11,342
Meaning?

222
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:14,592
Meaning, if you want to eat chicken,
the egg comes first,

223
00:18:14,675 --> 00:18:17,300
it hatches into a chicken, which you cook.

224
00:18:17,383 --> 00:18:20,258
But, if you want to have an omelet,
the chicken comes first,

225
00:18:20,342 --> 00:18:22,592
it lays the egg,
which you make into an omelet.

226
00:18:22,675 --> 00:18:26,300
Oh God, Insu! You have
the answer to every question.

227
00:18:26,717 --> 00:18:27,758
No, Mom.

228
00:18:28,258 --> 00:18:29,758
But, we'll find it, won't we?

229
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:34,675
Insu, it's impossible to argue with you.
- Then, don't.

230
00:18:35,175 --> 00:18:36,133
Promise me.

231
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:37,467
What?

232
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,133
If I make a good plan,
you will leave Father.

233
00:18:41,008 --> 00:18:41,925
Insu...

234
00:18:42,008 --> 00:18:43,508
Don't Insu me. Promise me.

235
00:18:44,883 --> 00:18:46,008
Mom, promise me.

236
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,925
Okay... fine...

237
00:18:48,883 --> 00:18:49,842
Go to sleep now. I promise.

238
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:51,675
-Like a definite promise?
-All right, I promise.

239
00:18:51,925 --> 00:18:52,925
A real promise?

240
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:54,050
Yes!

241
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,467
Bye.

242
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,925
Come on... quick.

243
00:19:47,508 --> 00:19:51,508
What about our journey?
I am afraid.

244
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:17,508
Insia.

245
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,675
Insia!

246
00:20:23,008 --> 00:20:25,383
Give me one example of irony.

247
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:28,133
Did this witch have to ask me
a question right now?

248
00:20:28,217 --> 00:20:30,883
I have just got a tune, If I think
about the answer I'll forget it.

249
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:31,842
Are you deaf?

250
00:20:32,425 --> 00:20:34,633
Give me one example of irony.

251
00:20:35,008 --> 00:20:36,508
Should I answer or stay with the tune?

252
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:38,717
Give me our hand.

253
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,342
I said, give me your hand!

254
00:20:41,217 --> 00:20:42,258
Go on, hit me.

255
00:20:56,008 --> 00:20:57,175
You are most welcome.

256
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,758
Guddu, open the door.

257
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,217
How long do you take to open the door?

258
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,175
Sorry... sorry.

259
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:33,217
Give it to me!

260
00:21:38,008 --> 00:21:39,300
What's this?!

261
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:41,883
Mom, what's this?!

262
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:43,592
What?

263
00:21:44,008 --> 00:21:45,508
I have no idea.

264
00:21:45,592 --> 00:21:47,050
Where did it come from, Guddu?

265
00:21:47,342 --> 00:21:48,925
Drama queen!

266
00:22:04,717 --> 00:22:06,217
Mom, how much did it cost?

267
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:08,092
Thousand rupees per kilo.

268
00:22:08,175 --> 00:22:10,092
Your laptop is more expensive
than mangoes.

269
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:13,258
Tell me. Where did you get the money from?

270
00:22:13,508 --> 00:22:14,800
It doesn't matter.

271
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,925
Last night if I had added
salt in the food,

272
00:22:18,008 --> 00:22:20,008
then perhaps you would've won this
in the competition.

273
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,633
But, I forgot.

274
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,050
Tell me honestly.

275
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,217
Did you borrow the money?

276
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,133
I can't accept it. Let's return it.

277
00:22:26,217 --> 00:22:27,717
Are you crazy, Insu?

278
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:30,467
There are so many things in life,
I have not been able to give you,

279
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,633
and nor will I be able to.

280
00:22:32,258 --> 00:22:34,592
Don't rob me of the joy
of seeing you smile.

281
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,592
It comes rarely.

282
00:23:01,342 --> 00:23:02,425
Mom!

283
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:03,467
Yes?

284
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:08,092
Look, the world is so big,
and our Baroda is so small.

285
00:23:08,883 --> 00:23:10,467
Is this Baroda?!

286
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:18,467
<i>Suddenly my eyes have learnt to dance</i>

287
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:22,342
<i>Suddenly my teeth have learnt to sparkle</i>

288
00:23:22,425 --> 00:23:26,217
<i>It feels like this heart of mine
Has just learnt to laugh</i>

289
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,758
<i>Laugh from the depths of my soul</i>

290
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:34,133
<i>Suddenly, my hair has learnt to bounce</i>

291
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:37,342
<i>Suddenly my stains have learnt to vanish</i>

292
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:42,008
<i>It feels like this heart of mine
Has just learnt to laugh</i>

293
00:23:42,092 --> 00:23:45,133
<i>Laugh from the depths of my soul</i>

294
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,758
<i>Suddenly the windows
Have begun to tickle me</i>

295
00:23:50,008 --> 00:23:53,592
<i>Suddenly the chairs
Have begun to tickle me</i>

296
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:59,967
<i>Suddenly every little thing
Is bringing me joy</i>

297
00:24:01,842 --> 00:24:05,633
<i>Suddenly the curries
Have begun to tickle me</i>

298
00:24:06,008 --> 00:24:09,508
<i>Suddenly the flatbreads
Have begun to tickle me</i>

299
00:24:09,717 --> 00:24:14,550
<i>Suddenly every little thing
Is bringing me joy</i>

300
00:24:33,883 --> 00:24:36,467
Who is this?
- No idea, Mom!

301
00:24:38,217 --> 00:24:39,258
Really?

302
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:47,508
<i>Suddenly every little thing
Is bringing me joy</i>

303
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,217
Why are you still awake at this hour?

304
00:26:24,592 --> 00:26:26,800
Mom, I want to upload
my videos on YouTube.

305
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:31,717
How wonderful.

306
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,633
Upload your videos on YouTube,

307
00:26:35,133 --> 00:26:37,133
and send it to your father in Riyadh.

308
00:26:37,467 --> 00:26:39,467
You know what will happen next.

309
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,258
I know, Mom.

310
00:26:41,717 --> 00:26:44,508
Insu, it's 3 am.

311
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:46,758
Stop dreaming and go to sleep.

312
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,925
How is that possible, Mom?

313
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,175
First you tell me to sleep,
then you ask me not to dream?

314
00:26:52,342 --> 00:26:55,008
When I sleep won't I end up dreaming?

315
00:26:55,133 --> 00:26:57,550
You tell me, why do we
wake up every morning?

316
00:26:57,633 --> 00:26:59,633
So that we can realize our dreams.

317
00:26:59,717 --> 00:27:02,300
Otherwise, what's the point
of waking up every day?

318
00:27:02,383 --> 00:27:05,175
Mom, there is no point
to anything without dreams.

319
00:27:05,258 --> 00:27:06,633
Neither to sleep, nor to wake up.

320
00:27:06,717 --> 00:27:08,175
Neither to live, nor to die.

321
00:27:08,258 --> 00:27:10,800
Mom, to dream is a basic right!

322
00:27:10,883 --> 00:27:14,217
Everyone should be allowed this much.
- Insu, how much you talk!

323
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,383
Tell me in one line, what do you want?

324
00:27:16,508 --> 00:27:17,883
Tell me, what is your dream?

325
00:27:17,967 --> 00:27:19,008
What do I want?

326
00:27:19,092 --> 00:27:21,425
Mom, I want the whole world
to hear my voice.

327
00:27:21,508 --> 00:27:24,133
Not just school, or Baroda, or India.

328
00:27:24,217 --> 00:27:26,008
The whole world should know me
as the best singer.

329
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:26,967
Not just you.

330
00:27:27,342 --> 00:27:28,717
That's my dream, too.

331
00:27:29,175 --> 00:27:31,175
And I'm sure it will come true.

332
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:32,508
Go to sleep now.

333
00:27:32,758 --> 00:27:35,092
Let it be, Mom.
It's useless talking to you.

334
00:27:47,175 --> 00:27:48,008
Insu.

335
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:51,300
I have an idea.

336
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,467
What?

337
00:27:58,258 --> 00:27:59,508
What are you doing?

338
00:27:59,592 --> 00:28:00,675
Wait.

339
00:28:01,217 --> 00:28:02,050
Here.

340
00:28:02,717 --> 00:28:03,717
What's this?

341
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,008
An idea.

342
00:28:05,258 --> 00:28:06,383
It's not an idea, it's a burqa.

343
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:07,383
Exactly!

344
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:08,717
What do you mean?

345
00:28:08,925 --> 00:28:10,550
I should wear this and make videos?
- Yes.

346
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:13,258
You want the entire world
to hear you, right?

347
00:28:13,342 --> 00:28:15,175
Why do they have to see your face?

348
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:16,467
They should hear you.

349
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,633
It does matter, Mom. How absurd?

350
00:28:18,717 --> 00:28:19,550
It's a horrible idea.

351
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:21,467
I want to be famous
and you tell me to hide my face?

352
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,050
No. You don't understand.

353
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:24,300
Listen to me.

354
00:28:24,592 --> 00:28:26,425
I'm not telling you
to change your destination.

355
00:28:27,092 --> 00:28:29,217
Just change your route.

356
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,467
You should allow that much.

357
00:28:32,258 --> 00:28:35,633
No, Mom. It's a stupid idea.
It will never work.

358
00:28:44,717 --> 00:28:48,383
To all those who are watching me,
this is my first YouTube video.

359
00:28:48,842 --> 00:28:49,925
My name is...

360
00:28:51,883 --> 00:28:53,550
I can't tell you all my name.

361
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:58,092
But if you like this video
please click 'like'.

362
00:29:13,217 --> 00:29:19,092
<i>Can someone tell me, where am I?</i>

363
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:25,758
<i>Can someone tell me, where I stand?</i>

364
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:32,425
<i>Have I chosen the correct path?</i>

365
00:29:33,217 --> 00:29:39,092
<i>Should I embark on this journey?</i>

366
00:29:40,342 --> 00:29:46,217
<i>I fear my dreams
Will they destroy me?</i>

367
00:29:47,008 --> 00:29:52,675
<i>I fear those close to me
Will they betray me?</i>

368
00:29:53,633 --> 00:29:56,717
<i>Am I the moon?
Or the shadows in it?</i>

369
00:29:57,008 --> 00:30:00,217
<i>Am I the ashes?
Or the raging fire?</i>

370
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,592
<i>Am I the drop?
Or the mighty wave?</i>

371
00:30:03,675 --> 00:30:09,592
<i>Do I bring tranquility?
Or do I unleash a storm?</i>

372
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:32,425
<i>Can someone tell me, who am I?</i>

373
00:30:33,175 --> 00:30:38,800
<i>Do I have a purpose?
A reason to be? Who am I?</i>

374
00:30:39,758 --> 00:30:45,633
<i>Do I believe in myself?</i>

375
00:30:46,508 --> 00:30:52,008
<i>Does my existence even matter?</i>

376
00:30:53,592 --> 00:30:59,467
<i>Whose shoulder do I cry onShould I falter?</i>

377
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:06,050
<i>Who will guide me
Should I lose my way?</i>

378
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:10,258
<i>Am I the moon?
Or the shadows in it?</i>

379
00:31:10,342 --> 00:31:13,467
<i>Am I the ashes?
Or the raging fire?</i>

380
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:16,883
<i>Am I the drop?
Or the mighty wave?</i>

381
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:21,300
<i>Do I bring tranquility?
Or do I unleash a storm?</i>

382
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:53,592
<i>Should I live my truth?
Or remain silent?</i>

383
00:31:53,675 --> 00:31:56,883
<i>Should I bear my soul?
Or break my heart?</i>

384
00:31:56,967 --> 00:32:00,217
<i>Should I cross all boundaries?
Or rein myself in?</i>

385
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,550
<i>Should I keep fighting?
Or just give up?</i>

386
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:07,050
<i>Am I the moon?
Or the shadows in it?</i>

387
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:10,342
<i>Am I the ashes?
Or the raging fire?</i>

388
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:13,675
<i>Am I the drop?
Or the mighty wave?</i>

389
00:32:13,758 --> 00:32:19,633
<i>Do I bring tranquility?
Or do I unleash a storm?</i>

390
00:32:30,383 --> 00:32:35,092
<i>Who am I?</i>

391
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,467
I knew it was a stupid idea.

392
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,550
Your mother put me in a fix.

393
00:34:08,758 --> 00:34:11,842
I already have so many children.
I shouldn't have taken you in.

394
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,842
Everyone knows that I don't take
more than 45 children.

395
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,467
I'm sorry, ma'am. It won't happen again.

396
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,425
Come, now.

397
00:34:17,508 --> 00:34:19,008
Find a place.

398
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,592
Yes, ma'am.
- It's 1173K.

399
00:34:27,675 --> 00:34:30,175
And 1973K.

400
00:34:41,383 --> 00:34:43,050
Ma'am, there's no other place to sit.

401
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:03,467
What is it?

402
00:35:03,883 --> 00:35:05,383
You came late to class.

403
00:35:05,717 --> 00:35:08,342
So, if you want notes,
I can share them with you.

404
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:09,592
Okay.

405
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,842
Hey, Insia.

406
00:35:16,008 --> 00:35:18,175
I added you on Facebook.

407
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,800
You didn't respond.

408
00:35:19,925 --> 00:35:22,133
Are we friends?
- Are we not?

409
00:35:30,342 --> 00:35:31,467
Chintan.

410
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:35,133
Tell me.

411
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,258
Do you have the trigonometry sums solved?

412
00:35:38,633 --> 00:35:39,592
Yes, I do.

413
00:35:39,675 --> 00:35:41,883
You can copy them.
I'll wait outside your house.

414
00:35:42,425 --> 00:35:43,508
Are you a watchman?

415
00:35:43,883 --> 00:35:44,717
No.

416
00:35:44,967 --> 00:35:46,175
You can come inside.

417
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:47,883
Okay.

418
00:35:51,592 --> 00:35:52,508
Insu.

419
00:35:55,217 --> 00:35:56,300
Lay the table.

420
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:01,008
Mom!

421
00:36:01,883 --> 00:36:02,925
Mom.

422
00:36:03,842 --> 00:36:04,758
Mom.

423
00:36:04,925 --> 00:36:06,592
Insu. Easy.
- Come here.

424
00:36:06,675 --> 00:36:07,925
Calm down.

425
00:36:08,342 --> 00:36:09,383
Look, Mom.

426
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,925
This is your video!

427
00:36:11,008 --> 00:36:13,467
Yes, and guess how many people
have watched it?

428
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,342
11,470 people!

429
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:16,425
Seriously?
- Yes.

430
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,300
I have never even met
so many people in my life.

431
00:36:19,383 --> 00:36:20,717
All thanks to this laptop.

432
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,383
Your idea worked, Mom.

433
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:23,592
I told you, didn't I?

434
00:36:23,675 --> 00:36:25,050
Now I'll be a superstar, too!

435
00:36:28,175 --> 00:36:29,842
Insu, listen...

436
00:36:30,342 --> 00:36:32,217
everyone knows a superstar.

437
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,050
You'll have to remain a secret.

438
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:37,842
Or your father will throw us
out of the house along with this laptop.

439
00:36:37,925 --> 00:36:39,258
Try to understand.
- Don't worry, Mom.

440
00:36:39,383 --> 00:36:40,342
Insu.

441
00:36:40,925 --> 00:36:44,092
I mean it.
Your father shouldn't get to know.

442
00:36:44,175 --> 00:36:45,508
How will Father know?

443
00:36:45,592 --> 00:36:46,967
Father doesn't watch YouTube.

444
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,467
Promise. Nothing will happen.

445
00:36:51,508 --> 00:36:52,467
Alright.

446
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
Before your grand-aunt yells,
I'll serve dinner.

447
00:36:56,258 --> 00:36:57,425
Listen. Come here.

448
00:36:57,842 --> 00:36:59,842
What is it now, Mom?
- Your father will be back tomorrow.

449
00:37:00,467 --> 00:37:02,717
He's going to be home all day.
Please keep this thing shut.

450
00:37:03,383 --> 00:37:05,383
Mom, when will Father
get that job in Riyadh?

451
00:37:06,008 --> 00:37:08,425
Once he does, he will be
out of our lives for 11 months, right?

452
00:37:08,508 --> 00:37:11,467
Yes, and during Ramadan,
he'll be in the house 24 hours.

453
00:37:12,592 --> 00:37:14,800
Only one month, right? We'll bear with it.

454
00:37:14,883 --> 00:37:16,092
It's not a bad deal.

455
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,383
Hey, what's your name?

456
00:37:21,467 --> 00:37:22,717
You are so talented.

457
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,758
Your videos are damn good.

458
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:27,092
Do you have a Twitter account
or a Facebook page?

459
00:37:27,175 --> 00:37:28,467
So sad!

460
00:37:28,967 --> 00:37:30,633
You can't show your face?

461
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,508
How does it matter
if she shows her face or not?

462
00:37:34,008 --> 00:37:35,383
What an amazing voice this child has!

463
00:37:35,925 --> 00:37:39,675
Otherwise, videos nowadays are short
on both talent and clothes.

464
00:37:41,258 --> 00:37:43,175
You have such an amazing voice.

465
00:37:43,383 --> 00:37:45,592
When do we get to see your next video?

466
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:46,967
Thank you.

467
00:37:47,175 --> 00:37:48,633
You are not sleepy either?

468
00:37:48,717 --> 00:37:50,133
It's 3 am.

469
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:53,800
I'm in New York.
It's 5.30 in the evening here.

470
00:37:54,383 --> 00:37:55,342
Mom.

471
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:57,050
Mom.

472
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:00,008
Mom, people in New York
are watching my video, too.

473
00:38:00,217 --> 00:38:01,050
Mom.

474
00:38:15,717 --> 00:38:16,592
Salam.

475
00:38:17,383 --> 00:38:18,217
All well?

476
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,133
Yes.

477
00:38:19,217 --> 00:38:20,217
How's Guddu?

478
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,217
He's fine.

479
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:31,925
What's this?

480
00:38:32,467 --> 00:38:33,425
Where did it come from?

481
00:38:33,675 --> 00:38:35,050
Brother sent it.

482
00:38:35,675 --> 00:38:38,675
No one was using it at his house.

483
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:41,717
Has your brother ever sent anything new?

484
00:38:43,883 --> 00:38:46,508
He likes dumping his trash here.

485
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:02,217
Aunt.

486
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,592
Shah Rukh Khan's film is showing.

487
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:08,467
Do you want to watch it?
- Since your uncle passed away,

488
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,675
I haven't gone to the theater.

489
00:39:11,217 --> 00:39:13,508
Shall we go, then?
- That's a great idea.

490
00:39:13,842 --> 00:39:15,550
Insu, too, has been wanting
to watch a film.

491
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,425
Doesn't Insia have assignments to do?

492
00:39:17,717 --> 00:39:19,592
Aren't the 10th grade exams important?

493
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:21,342
Films, television, guitar...

494
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:22,758
Stop everything this year.

495
00:39:23,258 --> 00:39:24,467
And now this laptop...

496
00:39:24,758 --> 00:39:26,217
What use is it?

497
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,550
Come here.

498
00:39:29,175 --> 00:39:31,967
It is very difficult to find a match
for an illiterate, uneducated girl.

499
00:39:32,467 --> 00:39:34,967
I got stuck. Not everyone will.

500
00:39:44,258 --> 00:39:45,175
I'm sorry.

501
00:39:52,092 --> 00:39:53,550
Be careful, Aunt.

502
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,675
Hello, everyone.

503
00:40:21,925 --> 00:40:23,633
Thank you for your likes and comments.

504
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:25,383
Here's my second video.

505
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:27,425
This song is for my mom.

506
00:40:30,592 --> 00:40:34,675
<i>She's a little cute</i>

507
00:40:35,175 --> 00:40:39,258
<i>And a little stern too</i>

508
00:40:39,592 --> 00:40:43,758
<i>She's a little cool</i>

509
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:48,217
<i>And a little old school too</i>

510
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:53,592
<i>She's like a sweet, chilled juice</i>

511
00:40:53,675 --> 00:40:57,133
<i>On a hot summer day</i>

512
00:40:57,717 --> 00:41:02,425
<i>She's like a warm blanket</i>

513
00:41:02,508 --> 00:41:06,425
<i>On a freezing winter night</i>

514
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:10,967
<i>My dearest mom</i>

515
00:41:11,217 --> 00:41:15,383
<i>She's my dearestMy mom</i>

516
00:41:15,842 --> 00:41:20,008
<i>My dearest mom</i>

517
00:41:20,258 --> 00:41:24,883
<i>She's my dearestMy mom</i>

518
00:41:55,258 --> 00:41:59,508
<i>When I'm troubled
She's all tears</i>

519
00:41:59,592 --> 00:42:04,133
<i>In my joy, too
Her tears make her scarf wet</i>

520
00:42:04,383 --> 00:42:08,842
<i>With every tear drop
She weaves blessings</i>

521
00:42:08,925 --> 00:42:13,050
<i>Will someone tell me
Are all moms are like this?</i>

522
00:42:17,008 --> 00:42:20,967
<i>Sometimes she's practical</i>

523
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:25,258
<i>And sometimes she's emotional</i>

524
00:42:26,092 --> 00:42:30,133
<i>Her one smile</i>

525
00:42:30,508 --> 00:42:34,592
<i>Dispels all my worries</i>

526
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:39,342
<i>She's like a master key</i>

527
00:42:39,633 --> 00:42:43,717
<i>Which opens all the locks to my fortunes</i>

528
00:42:44,175 --> 00:42:48,967
<i>I've placed in her care</i>

529
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:52,675
<i>All my trunks, full of dreams</i>

530
00:42:53,217 --> 00:42:57,050
<i>My dearest mom</i>

531
00:42:57,633 --> 00:43:01,967
<i>She's my dearestMy mom</i>

532
00:43:02,258 --> 00:43:06,467
<i>She's my dearestMy mom</i>

533
00:43:06,675 --> 00:43:12,050
<i>She's my dearestMy mom</i>

534
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,633
<i>My dearest mom</i>

535
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:45,675
<i>My dearest mom</i>

536
00:43:45,842 --> 00:43:50,008
<i>My dearest mom</i>

537
00:43:50,258 --> 00:43:56,175
<i>My dearest mom</i>

538
00:44:07,217 --> 00:44:08,050
Chintan.

539
00:44:08,883 --> 00:44:10,008
Does ma'am yell at you?

540
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,175
Yes.

541
00:44:11,258 --> 00:44:12,633
She yells at me more.

542
00:44:14,175 --> 00:44:15,008
Hey!

543
00:44:38,758 --> 00:44:40,550
Ma'am, I'm done.

544
00:44:41,383 --> 00:44:42,758
So fast?
- Yes.

545
00:44:43,175 --> 00:44:44,425
Show it to me.

546
00:44:45,467 --> 00:44:46,467
Wait a minute, Insia.

547
00:44:46,842 --> 00:44:48,008
What's this?

548
00:44:48,758 --> 00:44:51,550
Teacher, I'll come prepared tomorrow
and take the test again.

549
00:44:51,967 --> 00:44:54,883
Get your mom to sign this.

550
00:44:55,175 --> 00:44:57,717
Your mom pleaded with me
to take you in this class.

551
00:44:57,967 --> 00:45:00,592
Taking you in was a waste of my time.

552
00:45:00,883 --> 00:45:02,300
It wasn't the pleading,

553
00:45:02,508 --> 00:45:04,092
it was double the fees that worked on you!

554
00:45:04,175 --> 00:45:05,300
Oh, really?

555
00:45:06,592 --> 00:45:08,758
Your father is the one
paying me 'double fees'.

556
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:11,675
My fees come from his hard earned money.

557
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,133
So, get his signature too.

558
00:45:16,258 --> 00:45:17,883
I'm so sorry, ma'am. I didn't mean...

559
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:19,383
Go, get the signatures.

560
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:20,592
I'm sorry, ma'am. Please...

561
00:45:20,675 --> 00:45:22,467
Go or I will call your home.

562
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:23,800
Get the signatures.

563
00:45:27,675 --> 00:45:29,842
Ma'am, I'm done too.

564
00:45:33,508 --> 00:45:35,342
Insia, what happened?

565
00:45:35,842 --> 00:45:37,008
I'm sorry.

566
00:46:13,592 --> 00:46:14,842
Hey, this is you, isn't it?

567
00:46:15,217 --> 00:46:16,758
What? What rubbish?

568
00:46:17,217 --> 00:46:18,633
And what are you doing here?

569
00:46:19,217 --> 00:46:20,717
I've seen all your videos.

570
00:46:20,925 --> 00:46:23,592
I had a feeling it's you.
Because I recognize your voice.

571
00:46:23,967 --> 00:46:25,925
Everyone at school watches your videos.

572
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,467
Who else knows?

573
00:46:29,342 --> 00:46:31,592
I don't think anyone else knows. Only me.

574
00:46:32,633 --> 00:46:33,717
Hey, just a minute!

575
00:46:33,883 --> 00:46:36,633
You don't want anyone to know,
that's why you wear a burqa, right?

576
00:46:37,342 --> 00:46:38,175
Insu?

577
00:46:38,258 --> 00:46:40,383
Chintan, please take this newspaper
and leave.

578
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:42,675
And don't tell anyone about this, please.

579
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:43,717
Okay. Don't worry.

580
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,925
I keep everyone's secrets.
I never reveal anyone's secrets.

581
00:46:46,925 --> 00:46:48,133
Thanks, Chintan.

582
00:46:48,842 --> 00:46:52,008
By the way,
can I tell you one of my secrets?

583
00:46:52,383 --> 00:46:53,258
Sure.

584
00:46:54,467 --> 00:46:55,342
Well...

585
00:46:57,217 --> 00:47:00,675
What?
- Not because you are a superstar.

586
00:47:00,758 --> 00:47:02,883
I swear to God!
I've loved you way before that.

587
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:05,717
You must have felt it too?

588
00:47:06,008 --> 00:47:07,842
Leave. I have to go home.

589
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,717
Should I go?

590
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,842
Go.

591
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,050
Najma.
- Yes?

592
00:47:20,675 --> 00:47:21,967
Have you taken the newspaper?

593
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,300
The newspaper hasn't come today.

594
00:47:34,092 --> 00:47:35,300
<i>Welcome back, guys.</i>

595
00:47:35,425 --> 00:47:36,342
<i>Bollywood's news...</i>

596
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:37,717
Be sure to deduct his money.

597
00:47:38,467 --> 00:47:39,633
Today's not a holiday.

598
00:47:39,717 --> 00:47:40,592
Sure.

599
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:43,508
<i>- Secret Superstar. </i>

600
00:47:44,342 --> 00:47:46,383
<i>- Anonymous, yet famous. </i>

601
00:47:48,425 --> 00:47:52,633
<i>- Who is this mysterious girl
who won't show us her face?</i>

602
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:55,883
<i>- Is this a marketing strategy? </i>

603
00:47:56,508 --> 00:47:58,550
<i>- If not, then who is this person,</i>

604
00:47:58,633 --> 00:48:02,008
<i>who has taken the Internet by storm
in barely four months? </i>

605
00:48:03,175 --> 00:48:04,508
<i>- Friends... you must've heard...</i>

606
00:48:04,592 --> 00:48:06,300
Father, look at this dinosaur...

607
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,300
I'm sorry, Father.

608
00:48:09,717 --> 00:48:11,217
Why are you always in a hurry, Guddu?

609
00:48:11,467 --> 00:48:15,508
<i>- Coco Money Singh's song
has got one million views.</i>

610
00:48:16,842 --> 00:48:22,425
<i>But our Secret Superstar
has got thirty million views!</i>

611
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,133
<i>Not just that,</i>

612
00:48:24,217 --> 00:48:28,175
<i>her song 'Who Am I?' is trending
on number one on YouTube.</i>

613
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:32,592
<i>- And Superstar Amitabh Bachchan himself
has tweeted about this song.</i>

614
00:48:33,383 --> 00:48:37,383
<i>This afternoon the All India committee
of the Singers' Association,</i>

615
00:48:37,467 --> 00:48:41,967
<i>has boycotted music composer
Mr. Shakti Kumaarr.</i>

616
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:46,467
<i>The committee is deeply upset

617
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:49,342
<i>on the Singing Idol show.</i>

618
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,925
<i>The situation is such</i>

619
00:48:51,008 --> 00:48:55,883
<i>that no singer is ready to singfor Shakti Kumaarr's new film.</i>

620
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:59,258
<i>- Now, the producer will have no choice
but to replace him. </i>

621
00:48:59,383 --> 00:49:00,425
By the way,

622
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:03,800
it's Zahir's daughter's wedding tomorrow.
You have to come, too.

623
00:49:03,967 --> 00:49:06,342
And there's no need to wear a burqa there.

624
00:49:06,967 --> 00:49:09,883
They are very modern. They won't like it.

625
00:49:10,425 --> 00:49:12,050
Guddu, you come with us too.

626
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,842
Hi, ma'am

627
00:49:18,842 --> 00:49:19,967
I'm in love with you.

628
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:23,383
I haven't seen your face,
but I love your voice.

629
00:49:23,467 --> 00:49:24,342
Bye!

630
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,925
Babes, I saw your video.

631
00:49:33,258 --> 00:49:35,133
Hiding your face, eh?

632
00:49:36,675 --> 00:49:38,008
Naughty... naughty!

633
00:49:39,258 --> 00:49:42,092
You have a pretty good voice.
Not bad. You have potential.

634
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,842
If you want to make your future,
then call Shakti.

635
00:49:46,258 --> 00:49:48,842
Yuck!
- My number is 98200...

636
00:49:49,008 --> 00:49:51,008
Couldn't A.R. Rahman have emailed instead?

637
00:49:58,592 --> 00:49:59,800
Go on, talk to him.

638
00:50:07,425 --> 00:50:08,300
What happened?

639
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,508
Father, we had a science test.

640
00:50:14,008 --> 00:50:15,717
The same? 50 percent again?

641
00:50:16,675 --> 00:50:18,633
No, Father, this was just a test
at the private tuition.

642
00:50:19,467 --> 00:50:21,508
I will study harder for the school exams.

643
00:50:22,717 --> 00:50:23,967
How much did you score?

644
00:50:25,342 --> 00:50:27,258
-Thirty.
-Out of?

645
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:29,342
Hundred.

646
00:50:33,467 --> 00:50:34,342
You failed?

647
00:50:35,592 --> 00:50:36,425
Yes, Father.

648
00:50:36,925 --> 00:50:39,383
But this was a surprise test.

649
00:50:39,467 --> 00:50:41,592
I was totally unprepared.

650
00:50:42,175 --> 00:50:44,342
Had I known earlier,
I would've gone prepared.

651
00:50:45,508 --> 00:50:47,508
I need your signature on this.

652
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:02,842
Father, look how strictly
she has assessed it.

653
00:51:12,925 --> 00:51:14,675
Get me your guitar.

654
00:51:15,383 --> 00:51:16,508
What?

655
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:19,550
Father, I'm sorry.

656
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:23,217
I'll study well for the school exams.
I will score 70 percent.

657
00:51:23,508 --> 00:51:25,967
70 percent? You can't even pass!

658
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,842
I said, bring me your guitar.

659
00:51:28,175 --> 00:51:29,550
I'm sorry, Father.

660
00:51:30,675 --> 00:51:33,425
Don't make me ask you again.

661
00:52:07,633 --> 00:52:09,383
Don't restring it till I tell you to.

662
00:52:12,967 --> 00:52:14,758
How is this connected to my exams?

663
00:52:14,842 --> 00:52:16,383
Even if I don't play, I could still fail!

664
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:18,342
Insu! Is this how you talk to your father?

665
00:52:18,425 --> 00:52:20,008
Apologize to him. Listen.
- What did you say?

666
00:52:20,092 --> 00:52:21,092
I'm sorry.

667
00:52:22,717 --> 00:52:24,300
She's just a child. Let her go.

668
00:52:25,133 --> 00:52:27,592
Are you doing me a favor by apologizing?

669
00:52:28,717 --> 00:52:30,092
I'm sorry.
- Let her go.

670
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:35,342
Insu.

671
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,342
Why are you irritating me, Chintan?
Go away.

672
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,883
I'm sorry. Take care.

673
00:53:10,883 --> 00:53:11,883
Say 'Who's there'.

674
00:53:11,967 --> 00:53:13,842
I have a great 'knock, knock' joke.

675
00:53:14,175 --> 00:53:15,508
Why are you bugging me, Chintan?

676
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,008
"Hi, Insia!"

677
00:53:25,592 --> 00:53:28,217
"I see you're in a bad mood."

678
00:53:28,633 --> 00:53:29,800
"I'm a lollipop."

679
00:53:30,217 --> 00:53:31,467
"Why don't you eat me?"

680
00:53:33,092 --> 00:53:36,008
Are you a pet dog?
Why do you always follow me?

681
00:53:36,092 --> 00:53:38,217
Why are you so obsessed with me?
What's your problem?

682
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,842
I've told you off
four times since morning.

683
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:43,092
But you don't understand.
Because you have no self-respect.

684
00:53:43,425 --> 00:53:44,383
I'm sorry.

685
00:53:45,133 --> 00:53:46,300
I'm sorry.

686
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:48,175
I'm extremely sorry.

687
00:54:07,425 --> 00:54:08,550
You're looking like a star.

688
00:54:09,633 --> 00:54:10,842
Come on... hurry up.

689
00:54:11,217 --> 00:54:12,175
How much longer?

690
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:14,175
I'm coming. Just a minute longer.

691
00:54:17,342 --> 00:54:19,175
Insu, eat your food.

692
00:54:19,467 --> 00:54:20,592
And serve grand-aunt, too.

693
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:21,717
We'll be late.

694
00:54:23,258 --> 00:54:24,425
Shall we go?
- Yes.

695
00:54:26,925 --> 00:54:27,967
Will you come like this?

696
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,633
What's wrong?

697
00:54:30,883 --> 00:54:32,217
Something's missing.

698
00:54:32,467 --> 00:54:35,258
Wear that gold necklace
your father gave you, the cheap one.

699
00:54:36,217 --> 00:54:37,883
Otherwise, people will think

700
00:54:37,967 --> 00:54:40,717
that this engineer husband
can't even buy his wife a necklace.

701
00:54:41,633 --> 00:54:42,967
I don't know where I've kept it.

702
00:54:43,592 --> 00:54:45,383
If I start looking for it now,
it'll get very late.

703
00:54:45,842 --> 00:54:48,758
Let's go.
- It's not like we live in a palace!

704
00:54:48,842 --> 00:54:49,967
It's a small house.

705
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:51,675
Look for it. I'll wait.

706
00:54:51,758 --> 00:54:52,967
I remember now.

707
00:54:53,633 --> 00:54:55,300
It's in the bank locker.

708
00:54:58,008 --> 00:54:59,592
Have you taken sleeping pills?

709
00:55:00,925 --> 00:55:02,758
We gave up the locker four months ago.

710
00:55:02,842 --> 00:55:04,883
Don't waste time. Go... find it.

711
00:55:05,342 --> 00:55:07,925
Actually, I forgot to tell you.

712
00:55:08,092 --> 00:55:10,300
I left it at my brother's house.

713
00:55:10,383 --> 00:55:12,633
You had worn it on Eid.
We haven't met your brother after that.

714
00:55:12,717 --> 00:55:13,967
Don't bullshit me!

715
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,300
Go inside.

716
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:17,925
I said, find it. That's it!

717
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:21,217
Nonsense!
- Come, I'll help you find it.

718
00:55:21,967 --> 00:55:23,175
I'll wait here.

719
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:31,342
Mom, you sold the necklace
to buy the laptop?

720
00:55:31,842 --> 00:55:34,217
What else could I do?
There was nothing else to sell.

721
00:55:35,217 --> 00:55:37,175
Why did you sell the gold necklace?

722
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,383
What should we tell Father now?

723
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:41,758
I don't know, Insu.

724
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,550
What should we do?

725
00:55:47,258 --> 00:55:49,425
I'll say that I've kept it somewhere.
I can't find it.

726
00:55:49,508 --> 00:55:50,425
Will Father believe you?

727
00:55:50,925 --> 00:55:52,133
I don't know, Insu.

728
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,050
I don't know what to say.

729
00:55:56,675 --> 00:55:59,050
I'll have to say something.
There's no other way out.

730
00:55:59,258 --> 00:56:01,133
I'll say I've misplaced it.

731
00:56:04,217 --> 00:56:05,550
Let's try that.

732
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:21,092
I'm looking for it. I'll find it.

733
00:56:21,175 --> 00:56:23,883
Insu, look there in that box.

734
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:25,050
I must've kept it there.

735
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,133
Look in that box below.

736
00:56:48,008 --> 00:56:49,342
Can't find it.

737
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,383
Sell the house next without asking me.

738
00:57:03,133 --> 00:57:04,758
Father, listen...
- Did I speak to you?

739
00:57:07,008 --> 00:57:09,133
Father, but...
- Did I speak to you?

740
00:57:12,383 --> 00:57:14,050
I was going to tell you.

741
00:57:14,925 --> 00:57:15,925
Father... listen...

742
00:57:16,175 --> 00:57:18,300
Father, I had insisted... Listen, Father.

743
00:57:18,383 --> 00:57:19,425
Stand here.

744
00:57:20,133 --> 00:57:21,092
Father, listen to me.

745
00:57:21,175 --> 00:57:22,800
I'll definitely sell the laptop tomorrow.

746
00:57:22,883 --> 00:57:24,467
And we will buy a similar necklace.

747
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,300
Father, it's my fault, not hers.

748
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:28,175
Insia, take Guddu and go inside.

749
00:57:28,258 --> 00:57:30,675
I'm telling you the truth.
Mom had nothing to do with this.

750
00:57:30,758 --> 00:57:32,925
Didn't you hear me?
Take Guddu and go inside.

751
00:57:33,008 --> 00:57:34,758
Father, it's not her fault.

752
00:57:34,842 --> 00:57:36,717
I'm responsible for this.

753
00:57:36,925 --> 00:57:39,800
Do you want your brother to see this?

754
00:57:39,883 --> 00:57:40,717
Do you?

755
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:44,925
You should definitely be seeing this
because it's all your fault.

756
00:57:45,008 --> 00:57:47,508
She really had nothing to do with this.

757
00:57:48,008 --> 00:57:48,883
Father...

758
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,675
Insu.

759
00:57:58,967 --> 00:58:00,342
Take Guddu inside.

760
00:58:02,842 --> 00:58:04,050
Go. Go inside.

761
00:58:09,425 --> 00:58:10,800
- Tell me, what else you have sold.

762
00:58:10,883 --> 00:58:15,050
- Don't tell me later, you sold this
and that and forgot to tell me.

763
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:16,675
- What are you looking down for?

764
00:58:16,967 --> 00:58:19,175
- Look at me. I'm asking you something.

765
00:58:19,258 --> 00:58:20,592
- Yes? I'm asking you.

766
00:58:20,675 --> 00:58:21,550
- Answer me.

767
00:58:21,633 --> 00:58:22,467
- Tell me.

768
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:24,133
- Who am I? Am I a dog?

769
00:58:24,217 --> 00:58:25,050
- Am I your servant?

770
00:58:25,133 --> 00:58:27,592
- Put a leash around my neck
and tie me outside.

771
00:58:27,675 --> 00:58:29,175
- Is this what I'm worth?

772
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,175
- Who do you think I am?

773
00:58:33,383 --> 00:58:34,967
- Will you say something?

774
00:58:35,133 --> 00:58:37,550
- Or have you gone mute? Mistake? How?

775
00:58:37,883 --> 00:58:40,175
- How? Did it happen on its own?

776
00:58:40,342 --> 00:58:41,425
- You must've planned it.

777
00:58:41,508 --> 00:58:44,092
- So you didn't plan it?

778
00:58:44,175 --> 00:58:45,758
- Was it involuntary?

779
00:58:46,092 --> 00:58:47,425
- Tell me.

780
00:58:51,925 --> 00:58:53,383
Father, stop it, please.

781
00:58:53,467 --> 00:58:55,550
I don't want the laptop. You can sell it.

782
00:58:55,675 --> 00:58:57,217
I'm admitting that it's my fault.

783
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,550
Right. The laptop.

784
00:58:58,758 --> 00:58:59,800
Where is it?

785
00:59:00,467 --> 00:59:02,550
Najma. Go and get the laptop.

786
00:59:02,717 --> 00:59:03,633
Laptop.

787
00:59:06,967 --> 00:59:07,883
Hurry up.

788
00:59:33,217 --> 00:59:34,133
Throw it out.

789
00:59:36,467 --> 00:59:37,842
Why are you looking at her?

790
00:59:37,925 --> 00:59:39,300
Oh, right! It's your laptop.

791
00:59:39,383 --> 00:59:42,592
And you are the one who wanted it.
So, you should throw it out.

792
01:01:04,258 --> 01:01:08,092
Today, let's turn to page number 22
of our Gujarati textbooks.

793
01:01:08,175 --> 01:01:12,092
We shall recite this beautiful poem called

794
01:01:12,175 --> 01:01:14,967
<i>Mane Joine Udi Jata Pakshi.</i>

795
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:19,425
Which means,
the birds who fly at my sight.

796
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:46,383
You are angry, right? Because you
insulted me in front of everyone?

797
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:49,550
You are the one who should be angry.

798
01:01:49,883 --> 01:01:51,008
I'm sorry.

799
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:54,092
Actually, that was my trick.

800
01:01:55,258 --> 01:01:58,217
Yes, I do the same thing with my mom.

801
01:01:59,008 --> 01:02:02,300
When she's in a bad mood,
I try to cheer her up.

802
01:02:02,842 --> 01:02:04,217
Instead, she yells at me.

803
01:02:04,342 --> 01:02:07,717
And when she does that,
she releases her anger.

804
01:02:08,008 --> 01:02:09,258
Then she's back to normal.

805
01:02:09,467 --> 01:02:11,883
So, I thought I should use
the same trick on you.

806
01:02:17,008 --> 01:02:17,925
No problem. It's okay.

807
01:02:20,342 --> 01:02:21,217
Flatbread?

808
01:02:23,217 --> 01:02:25,175
It's the best flatbread in the universe.

809
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:28,008
Then I'll have to eat it.

810
01:02:32,383 --> 01:02:33,967
You both are friends now, right?

811
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,467
You read his tweet?

812
01:02:36,217 --> 01:02:39,300
I read all your tweets.
And the ones by your fans, too.

813
01:02:39,925 --> 01:02:42,550
That music composer, Shakti Kumaarr,

814
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,050
has also sent you a tweet.

815
01:02:44,133 --> 01:02:45,383
Call him.

816
01:02:45,467 --> 01:02:47,425
You can be a playback singer in his film.

817
01:02:47,508 --> 01:02:48,800
I won't call him.

818
01:02:49,217 --> 01:02:50,967
Why?
- He's not a nice man.

819
01:02:51,383 --> 01:02:52,383
Do you know him?

820
01:02:52,467 --> 01:02:53,342
No!

821
01:02:53,425 --> 01:02:55,175
Then how do you know
that he's not a nice person?

822
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:56,675
I've seen it on the news.

823
01:02:58,925 --> 01:03:00,550
And his wife left him, too.

824
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,425
So, he must not be a nice man.

825
01:03:08,717 --> 01:03:10,592
My mom left my dad, too.

826
01:03:12,925 --> 01:03:14,425
But he is not a bad man.

827
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,675
My mom told me.

828
01:03:17,425 --> 01:03:19,675
I'm sorry, Chintan... I didn't know.

829
01:03:20,842 --> 01:03:21,717
It's not your fault.

830
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,967
Mom tells me, it's nobody's fault.

831
01:03:29,717 --> 01:03:30,883
Will you do me a favor?

832
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,342
Sure, tell me.

833
01:03:32,425 --> 01:03:33,842
My laptop broke.

834
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,092
Will you check my email?

835
01:03:37,008 --> 01:03:38,967
And post on Facebook and Twitter

836
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:40,758
that I won't be uploading videos
for some time.

837
01:03:41,342 --> 01:03:42,675
Due to some personal problem.

838
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:46,425
And, do you want to say anything
to Shakti Kumaarr?

839
01:03:58,175 --> 01:03:59,883
Insia, what's your password?

840
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,467
Give me a pen.

841
01:04:30,758 --> 01:04:32,550
Go... sit!

842
01:05:03,467 --> 01:05:04,508
Chintan.

843
01:05:04,883 --> 01:05:06,217
Chintan!
- Yes?

844
01:05:06,633 --> 01:05:07,592
Your stop.

845
01:05:07,967 --> 01:05:08,800
Oh... I see.

846
01:05:09,717 --> 01:05:11,175
I'll get off at the next stop.

847
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:13,717
Next stop... for sure.

848
01:05:16,883 --> 01:05:18,258
What's your mom like?

849
01:05:19,592 --> 01:05:21,383
Mom is like a child.

850
01:05:22,633 --> 01:05:23,550
What do you mean?

851
01:05:24,092 --> 01:05:28,717
You know how children are cute
but so naive.

852
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:30,758
Always scared.

853
01:05:30,842 --> 01:05:32,217
And very stupid.

854
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:36,633
You have to always explain
what's right for them, and what's not.

855
01:05:36,717 --> 01:05:37,967
Yet they never get it.

856
01:05:38,675 --> 01:05:40,217
Mom is exactly like that.

857
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,717
Absolutely stupid.

858
01:05:42,175 --> 01:05:43,633
How do you know?

859
01:05:44,217 --> 01:05:45,383
Know what?

860
01:05:45,467 --> 01:05:46,758
About children.

861
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:47,842
Do you have any?

862
01:05:51,008 --> 01:05:52,633
I'm sorry. I'm just joking.

863
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:59,008
There are two boys.

864
01:05:59,092 --> 01:06:00,842
This one beats the other.

865
01:06:00,925 --> 01:06:02,592
And he falls into the water...

866
01:06:03,675 --> 01:06:04,633
Salam, Father.

867
01:06:04,717 --> 01:06:05,550
Salam.

868
01:06:05,633 --> 01:06:06,758
How are you, child?

869
01:06:07,508 --> 01:06:10,258
I'm fine. Guddu, open your mouth.

870
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:12,800
What are we celebrating?

871
01:06:13,008 --> 01:06:15,008
Aunt, I've got that job in Riyadh.

872
01:06:16,008 --> 01:06:18,717
In one of the Sheikh's oil rigs.

873
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,258
As a senior engineer.

874
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:21,550
Very good.

875
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:23,842
Did you hear?
- Yes.

876
01:06:23,925 --> 01:06:25,050
Here, have some.

877
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,300
That's such good news.

878
01:06:26,842 --> 01:06:28,925
I'll make a thanks-giving prayer
tomorrow at the mausoleum.

879
01:06:29,217 --> 01:06:31,133
Why not?

880
01:06:31,383 --> 01:06:33,633
And tonight, we'll all eat out.

881
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:36,467
You come too.

882
01:06:36,883 --> 01:06:37,758
Okay, Father.

883
01:06:37,883 --> 01:06:38,842
Here, take it.

884
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,592
You've grown up so much.

885
01:06:49,008 --> 01:06:51,758
In these last few months,
enjoy your freedom.

886
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,842
Then you'll have to start a new life
in a new country.

887
01:06:56,217 --> 01:06:57,133
Right?

888
01:06:58,758 --> 01:07:02,758
Did you know, Zahir's friend lives there?

889
01:07:03,633 --> 01:07:06,800
He's the vice president
of the company I'll be working for.

890
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,467
He has a son.

891
01:07:09,217 --> 01:07:10,092
Razzaq.

892
01:07:10,342 --> 01:07:11,800
He has a travel agency.

893
01:07:12,133 --> 01:07:14,008
He also has a license for Hajj tours.

894
01:07:14,092 --> 01:07:15,883
He's a good boy. You will like him.

895
01:07:15,967 --> 01:07:18,467
Look. He has also sent some photographs.

896
01:07:27,717 --> 01:07:29,050
You knew all along, didn't you?

897
01:07:29,175 --> 01:07:32,508
That if Father got this job, we'll all
have to move with him to Saudi Arabia.

898
01:07:35,383 --> 01:07:37,592
I didn't think he'd get the job, Insu.

899
01:07:38,758 --> 01:07:40,550
Forget it, Mom.
I don't want to talk to you.

900
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:43,967
At least listen to me...
- Mom, please.

901
01:07:46,967 --> 01:07:47,925
Insu.

902
01:07:49,008 --> 01:07:50,425
Everything will be okay.

903
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:52,133
What will be okay?

904
01:07:52,425 --> 01:07:53,425
How?

905
01:07:55,758 --> 01:07:57,217
Mom, I'm telling you let's run away.

906
01:07:57,342 --> 01:07:58,633
Where will we go, Insu?

907
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:00,467
How does it matter?

908
01:08:00,842 --> 01:08:02,717
Anyway, in this house,
no one cares about us.

909
01:08:03,217 --> 01:08:06,133
He just cares about Guddu, doesn't he?
We'll leave Guddu behind.

910
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:07,633
What rubbish, Insu!

911
01:08:07,717 --> 01:08:08,925
If we leave Guddu here,

912
01:08:09,008 --> 01:08:10,717
he will grow up to be
exactly like his father.

913
01:08:10,842 --> 01:08:12,508
So what's the point of our lives?

914
01:08:13,383 --> 01:08:15,467
That we make Guddu
two percent better than him?

915
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,050
What about our lives?

916
01:08:17,133 --> 01:08:18,133
Insu.

917
01:08:19,008 --> 01:08:20,967
Some things are beyond our control.

918
01:08:21,383 --> 01:08:22,925
Wrong, Mom. Wrong!

919
01:08:23,133 --> 01:08:24,550
Everything is in our control.

920
01:08:25,008 --> 01:08:26,758
There's nothing that we can't do.

921
01:08:28,217 --> 01:08:30,842
I'm telling you, Mom.
I'm not going to Saudi Arabia.

922
01:08:31,133 --> 01:08:32,217
I'll run away.

923
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:34,133
And you shouldn't go either.

924
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:37,217
Mom, I'll plan something.

925
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:39,092
Insu...
- Insu... Insu... Insu!

926
01:08:39,175 --> 01:08:41,008
It's useless talking to you.

927
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:08,092
<i>Shakti Kumaarr's lifehas taken a new twist.</i>

928
01:09:08,425 --> 01:09:11,675
<i>The Mumbai Family Court
has ruled against him.</i>

929
01:09:11,758 --> 01:09:13,467
<i>And his wife has won the case.</i>

930
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:18,508
<i>His wife's lawyer, Sheena Sabavala,
has proved in the court,</i>

931
01:09:18,592 --> 01:09:22,133
<i>that he has not one,
not two, but three affairs!</i>

932
01:09:22,467 --> 01:09:24,508
<i>And that too, simultaneously!</i>

933
01:09:24,758 --> 01:09:27,883
<i>Here's what Shakti Kumaarr had to say.</i>

934
01:09:27,967 --> 01:09:29,800
<i>Sir, you lost the case. How do you feel?</i>

935
01:09:29,883 --> 01:09:31,175
<i>Bullshit. It's all rubbish.</i>

936
01:09:31,258 --> 01:09:35,508
<i>My wife's lawyer, Sheena Sabavala,has lied in court.</i>

937
01:09:35,717 --> 01:09:37,383
<i>I will appeal to the Supreme court.</i>

938
01:09:37,467 --> 01:09:39,550
<i>But are the rumors
about your affairs true?</i>

939
01:09:39,883 --> 01:09:41,467
<i>Shut up, you...
- Sir, please, sir.</i>

940
01:09:41,675 --> 01:09:46,092
<i>Now, let's meet the enemy
of such men, Sheena Sabavala.</i>

941
01:09:46,175 --> 01:09:48,675
<i>Ma'am, tell us aboutShakti Kumaarr's case.</i>

942
01:09:49,008 --> 01:09:52,425
<i>Shakti Kumaarr is an ill-mannered
and disgusting man. </i>

943
01:09:52,508 --> 01:09:54,717
<i>I'm very happy with the court's decision.</i>

944
01:09:54,925 --> 01:09:57,467
<i>It's important to teach a lesson
to men like Shakti.</i>

945
01:09:57,925 --> 01:09:59,467
<i>If I'm not mistaken</i>

946
01:09:59,675 --> 01:10:05,175
<i>this is Advocate Sheena Sabavala's11th victory this year.</i>

947
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:11,258
<i>Which means, she has ruined the lives
of 11 men in this one year alone.</i>

948
01:10:12,008 --> 01:10:16,050
<i>Sheena Sabavala has a perfect
track record in family court.</i>

949
01:10:16,508 --> 01:10:19,675
<i>Whether she's up against
a music composer or a mafia don,</i>

950
01:10:22,175 --> 01:10:24,675
<i>So, all the menwho are watching this show...</i>

951
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,217
Chintan.

952
01:10:41,467 --> 01:10:42,425
Come.

953
01:10:42,508 --> 01:10:45,008
I have some work. You carry on.

954
01:10:45,883 --> 01:10:46,800
Okay.

955
01:10:54,675 --> 01:10:56,217
I've saved it. It's in 'contacts'.

956
01:10:56,758 --> 01:10:58,508
But... there's a problem.

957
01:10:58,592 --> 01:10:59,467
What's the problem?

958
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,633
I recharge the phone with my allowance.

959
01:11:01,717 --> 01:11:04,758
There's no money left
on the phone, and I'm broke.

960
01:11:04,883 --> 01:11:06,050
So, I can't call?

961
01:11:06,133 --> 01:11:08,300
No. You can give him a missed call.
- A missed call?

962
01:11:08,842 --> 01:11:09,967
Why will he call me back?

963
01:11:10,092 --> 01:11:11,592
He will. Give it a try.

964
01:11:11,675 --> 01:11:13,258
How do you know he will call back?

965
01:11:13,467 --> 01:11:14,800
I have my fingers crossed!

966
01:11:41,383 --> 01:11:42,633
Try once more, please.

967
01:11:50,967 --> 01:11:53,592
I'm sorry. Tomorrow I'll take an advance
on my allowance.

968
01:11:53,675 --> 01:11:54,758
It's okay. Forget it.

969
01:11:58,092 --> 01:11:59,675
Chintan, go home.

970
01:11:59,758 --> 01:12:01,883
Don't irritate me. I want to be alone.

971
01:12:01,967 --> 01:12:03,467
I'm headed to your building.

972
01:12:03,633 --> 01:12:05,050
My friend stays there.

973
01:12:05,342 --> 01:12:06,300
Which friend?

974
01:12:08,175 --> 01:12:09,092
Jignesh.

975
01:12:09,175 --> 01:12:10,550
There's no Jignesh in my building.

976
01:12:10,633 --> 01:12:11,883
Oh, sorry.

977
01:12:11,967 --> 01:12:15,967
I thought every building in Baroda
would have at least one Jignesh.

978
01:12:16,717 --> 01:12:19,092
Chintan, please don't try
your tricks on me again.

979
01:12:19,175 --> 01:12:20,758
Go home.
- I'm sorry.

980
01:12:33,967 --> 01:12:35,425
Insia... Insu...

981
01:12:35,508 --> 01:12:37,342
He called back. Come quickly!

982
01:12:42,342 --> 01:12:43,883
Hello. Mr. Shakti?

983
01:12:45,508 --> 01:12:46,675
Insia Mallik...

984
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:51,217
My videos are on the internet
by the name of Secret Superstar.

985
01:12:51,758 --> 01:12:53,467
Yes sir, the girl in the burqa.

986
01:12:54,467 --> 01:12:56,258
Sorry, it's my friend's phone.

987
01:12:56,342 --> 01:12:58,342
There's no calling balance on his phone.
So...

988
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:00,758
Sir, Baroda.

989
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:02,675
Today?

990
01:13:02,758 --> 01:13:03,800
Not today, sir.

991
01:13:03,883 --> 01:13:04,842
Tomorrow?

992
01:13:05,092 --> 01:13:06,175
Yes, sir. Tomorrow.

993
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:09,217
But sir, I have one condition.

994
01:13:10,842 --> 01:13:14,175
If the recording goes well,
then you have to help me.

995
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:16,925
That I'll tell you tomorrow.

996
01:13:18,008 --> 01:13:19,258
Promise, sir?

997
01:13:19,758 --> 01:13:20,883
A real promise?

998
01:13:21,883 --> 01:13:22,800
Thank you, sir.

999
01:13:24,217 --> 01:13:26,925
Sir, can I... can you call me back
in two minutes, please?

1000
01:13:27,842 --> 01:13:28,967
Thank you, sir.

1001
01:13:31,883 --> 01:13:34,675
He wants me to go to Mumbai
tomorrow, to record a song.

1002
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,008
Chintan, how will I go?

1003
01:13:37,133 --> 01:13:38,050
By aeroplane.

1004
01:13:38,133 --> 01:13:38,967
Yes, I know.

1005
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:41,717
He said he'll book the flight
and send an airport pickup.

1006
01:13:42,883 --> 01:13:45,508
You'll have to skip school tomorrow.

1007
01:13:46,175 --> 01:13:47,758
I'll give you the class notes.

1008
01:13:48,258 --> 01:13:49,758
And anyway, you don't do your assignments.

1009
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:52,008
By the time school finishes,
you come back.

1010
01:13:53,008 --> 01:13:54,258
What if someone sees me?

1011
01:13:54,342 --> 01:13:56,633
You are the 'Secret Superstar'. 'Secret!'

1012
01:14:00,592 --> 01:14:01,842
There's one more problem.

1013
01:14:02,842 --> 01:14:04,133
I've never flown before.

1014
01:14:06,925 --> 01:14:08,425
- I'll make a plan by tomorrow.

1015
01:14:09,092 --> 01:14:10,883
Insu, wait...
- Mom, I'm getting late.

1016
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,717
Bye, Insu.
- Wait for two minutes.

1017
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,175
Hang on.

1018
01:14:14,467 --> 01:14:16,342
At least take your lunch box.

1019
01:14:16,425 --> 01:14:20,633
- Your mom drops you off at the bus stop.
So, you have to get on it.

1020
01:14:22,425 --> 01:14:24,300
- Don't worry about the ticket.
- Here's your ticket.

1021
01:14:24,508 --> 01:14:25,800
- I'll get its printout.

1022
01:14:28,008 --> 01:14:29,050
Come on, Insu. Hurry up!

1023
01:14:29,133 --> 01:14:30,967
- The bus drops us off
inside the school gate.

1024
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:34,133
- So, you'll have to make
your escape from school.

1025
01:14:34,883 --> 01:14:37,133
- As soon as you reach school,
go to the girls toilet.

1026
01:14:37,592 --> 01:14:38,842
- And, jump out from there.

1027
01:14:52,592 --> 01:14:53,425
Oh, no!

1028
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,925
- I know an escape route.

1029
01:15:05,425 --> 01:15:08,925
- I figured in case of a terrorist attack,
I must have an escape plan.

1030
01:15:09,008 --> 01:15:11,717
Chintan, there's a lock on this!
- Lock?

1031
01:15:14,175 --> 01:15:15,050
Now what?

1032
01:15:15,217 --> 01:15:16,550
I'll think of something.

1033
01:15:17,092 --> 01:15:19,258
I'll be late for the flight.

1034
01:15:19,508 --> 01:15:20,883
It won't break!

1035
01:15:32,383 --> 01:15:33,300
What are you doing?

1036
01:15:33,383 --> 01:15:34,217
Wait.

1037
01:15:39,925 --> 01:15:41,342
You'll have to jump the wall.

1038
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,133
Have you lost it?

1039
01:15:43,217 --> 01:15:44,550
Do you have a better idea?

1040
01:15:44,758 --> 01:15:46,550
How will I get back inside?

1041
01:15:46,633 --> 01:15:48,258
I have eight hours to figure that out.

1042
01:15:48,633 --> 01:15:49,758
I'll think of something.

1043
01:15:50,217 --> 01:15:51,425
Come on, give me your bag.

1044
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,217
Put one foot here.

1045
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,217
And one foot there.

1046
01:16:01,008 --> 01:16:01,967
Yes.

1047
01:16:09,883 --> 01:16:12,467
Land on your feet
or else you will hurt yourself.

1048
01:16:16,508 --> 01:16:17,383
Are you okay?

1049
01:16:17,883 --> 01:16:18,842
Yes, and you?

1050
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:20,383
I'm fine.

1051
01:16:22,425 --> 01:16:23,467
Listen...

1052
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,175
Yes?

1053
01:16:37,717 --> 01:16:39,258
The airport, please.

1054
01:16:41,342 --> 01:16:43,258
Please drive faster.

1055
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,050
- At the airport,
show your school ID and ticket.

1056
01:16:47,133 --> 01:16:47,967
Stop!

1057
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:50,758
- If questioned,
say that your grandfather is unwell.

1058
01:16:50,925 --> 01:16:51,842
Are you traveling alone?

1059
01:16:53,008 --> 01:16:55,175
My grandfather is unwell.

1060
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:56,508
Okay.

1061
01:17:01,008 --> 01:17:03,508
- At the airline counter,
ask for a window seat.

1062
01:17:16,967 --> 01:17:19,675
Mister, that's my seat.

1063
01:17:20,342 --> 01:17:22,008
It's a short flight.
Sit anywhere you want.

1064
01:17:27,092 --> 01:17:29,008
But the window seat is mine.

1065
01:17:29,342 --> 01:17:31,092
How does it matter?

1066
01:17:31,175 --> 01:17:33,092
I'm already sitting here. You sit there.

1067
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:37,675
Mister, that's my seat. Get up!

1068
01:17:53,883 --> 01:17:55,717
- Don't forget to fasten your seat belt.

1069
01:18:02,383 --> 01:18:04,800
- When the plane takes off, you'll see...

1070
01:18:05,717 --> 01:18:08,592
- how big the world is
and how small Baroda is.

1071
01:18:09,592 --> 01:18:12,467
- Your bad mood, your father,
Ms. Sheetal...

1072
01:18:12,717 --> 01:18:15,133
- leaving everyone behind,
you will fly away.

1073
01:18:16,133 --> 01:18:19,550
- I'll wave to you from down here,
but you won't be able to see me.

1074
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,050
Do you need an auto-rickshaw?

1075
01:18:37,133 --> 01:18:38,133
A taxi?

1076
01:18:38,217 --> 01:18:39,175
A hotel?

1077
01:18:39,258 --> 01:18:40,133
Where do you want to go?

1078
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:48,008
Secret Superstar?

1079
01:18:50,008 --> 01:18:50,925
No.

1080
01:18:51,258 --> 01:18:52,592
I'm the airport pickup.

1081
01:18:53,092 --> 01:18:54,133
I'm Ranjeet.

1082
01:18:54,842 --> 01:18:55,717
Come.

1083
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,383
Has Shakti Kumaarr sent you?

1084
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:00,883
Yes, ma'am. Shakti Kumaarr has sent me.

1085
01:19:01,175 --> 01:19:03,342
Now, shall we? Or else we'll be late.

1086
01:19:03,592 --> 01:19:04,508
Come on.

1087
01:19:11,883 --> 01:19:14,258
Unions don't operate on relationships,
but money.

1088
01:19:14,383 --> 01:19:15,717
Give as much as you want.

1089
01:19:17,758 --> 01:19:18,925
I'll call you back.

1090
01:19:42,508 --> 01:19:43,383
What a voice!

1091
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:47,092
My pleasure to meet you, kiddo.

1092
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:55,592
What an interesting journey!

1093
01:19:58,092 --> 01:20:01,258
Baroda, Burqa, YouTube,
Shakti Kumaarr and then...

1094
01:20:01,508 --> 01:20:02,383
Superstar!

1095
01:20:03,675 --> 01:20:06,300
I'll host a launch event for you.
At a five-star hotel. Big time!

1096
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:07,967
Industry, media, trade.

1097
01:20:08,467 --> 01:20:10,800
I'll buy the front page
of Mumbai Times for you.

1098
01:20:16,508 --> 01:20:19,592
Babes, don't mind,
but your name is low on glamour.

1099
01:20:21,008 --> 01:20:23,133
What does it mean? Your name? Insia?

1100
01:20:23,342 --> 01:20:24,967
It means 'woman'.

1101
01:20:25,425 --> 01:20:26,675
Oh! Woman...

1102
01:20:27,092 --> 01:20:27,967
Woman.

1103
01:20:29,675 --> 01:20:31,592
It sounds awful and it's meaning is worse.

1104
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:33,925
What about Shabnam?

1105
01:20:34,675 --> 01:20:35,717
Too old fashioned.

1106
01:20:36,092 --> 01:20:37,633
Sunny?
- That name has been taken.

1107
01:20:38,925 --> 01:20:39,800
Natashha!

1108
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:41,717
Natashha with a double H.

1109
01:20:42,133 --> 01:20:45,175
N-A-T-A-S-S-H-A. Natashha.

1110
01:20:46,217 --> 01:20:47,050
Sir.

1111
01:20:47,675 --> 01:20:50,633
I'm sorry but my identity
needs to remain a secret.

1112
01:20:51,425 --> 01:20:54,425
If my dad finds out, I'll be dead meat.

1113
01:20:56,008 --> 01:20:57,883
Look, sooner or later
the media will find out.

1114
01:20:58,175 --> 01:20:59,508
Whether I tell them or not.

1115
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:03,883
Anyway, we are short on time.
The shoot for the song is in two days.

1116
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:06,633
The album releases in two weeks.
And the film, in two months.

1117
01:21:06,717 --> 01:21:09,050
And you have to get back
to school in six hours.

1118
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:12,467
Ali, play the song.

1119
01:21:39,925 --> 01:21:41,717
<i>I'll speak your words</i>

1120
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,508
<i>I'll sing your praises</i>

1121
01:21:43,592 --> 01:21:46,842
<i>I'll adorn myselfWith the colors of your love</i>

1122
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:59,425
<i>Oh, I dance wild and free</i>

1123
01:21:59,758 --> 01:22:03,342
<i>For you, my sexy lover!</i>

1124
01:22:03,883 --> 01:22:07,633
<i>My sexy lover!</i>

1125
01:22:07,925 --> 01:22:10,675
<i>My sexy lover!</i>

1126
01:22:16,675 --> 01:22:17,633
It's a superhit, kiddo.

1127
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:20,633
Everything is by the grace of God.

1128
01:22:20,758 --> 01:22:22,550
On the mic, kiddo.

1129
01:22:22,633 --> 01:22:24,008
Ranjeet, take her to the mic.
- Okay.

1130
01:22:24,092 --> 01:22:24,925
Come on.

1131
01:22:34,592 --> 01:22:37,425
Ali, is everything ready?
- Yes, sir.

1132
01:22:37,508 --> 01:22:38,633
Okay, well done.

1133
01:22:45,758 --> 01:22:47,883
It's definitely a hit, kiddo. A superhit!

1134
01:22:48,383 --> 01:22:49,425
Just sing it.

1135
01:22:49,675 --> 01:22:50,717
Come on, go for it.

1136
01:22:50,925 --> 01:22:52,467
Sir, I need two minutes.

1137
01:23:09,175 --> 01:23:10,633
Let's start. Ready. Come on.

1138
01:23:13,467 --> 01:23:14,550
Go for it, kiddo.

1139
01:23:19,967 --> 01:23:20,842
Not like this, kiddo.

1140
01:23:27,383 --> 01:23:28,300
Don't you get it?

1141
01:23:40,133 --> 01:23:42,550
Do one thing. Start from the verse.

1142
01:23:42,717 --> 01:23:44,217
We'll patch the moaning later.
- Yes, sir.

1143
01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:47,675
<i>I'll speak your words</i>

1144
01:23:47,925 --> 01:23:49,467
<i>I'll sing your praises</i>

1145
01:23:49,717 --> 01:23:50,842
<i>I'll adorn myself with...</i>

1146
01:23:50,925 --> 01:23:53,050
This is not a hymn, kiddo.

1147
01:23:54,508 --> 01:23:57,008
Sing it with feeling.
Get the feeling of the song.

1148
01:23:59,258 --> 01:24:00,675
<i>I'll speak your words</i>

1149
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:02,425
<i>I'll sing your praises</i>

1150
01:24:05,508 --> 01:24:06,467
You are making a mistake.

1151
01:24:06,967 --> 01:24:08,383
You are singing from your head.

1152
01:24:09,133 --> 01:24:10,967
Do you know where
you should be singing from?

1153
01:24:11,425 --> 01:24:13,133
Heart, sir. From the heart.

1154
01:24:13,508 --> 01:24:14,342
Doomed!

1155
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,342
She wants to sing from the heart.

1156
01:24:17,342 --> 01:24:18,925
You don't have to sing
from your heart, kiddo.

1157
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:20,758
You have to sing with your body.

1158
01:24:21,092 --> 01:24:22,758
Meaning?
- Body language.

1159
01:24:25,092 --> 01:24:26,050
Body language.

1160
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:27,175
Okay?

1161
01:24:27,508 --> 01:24:29,675
You know what, you need
to loosen up. Open up a little.

1162
01:24:29,883 --> 01:24:31,425
Try jogging.

1163
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:32,758
Jogging?
- Yes.

1164
01:24:32,842 --> 01:24:34,633
Where?
- Right there. Spot jogging.

1165
01:24:34,842 --> 01:24:35,675
Come on, I'll show you.

1166
01:24:37,842 --> 01:24:39,008
Yes, go for it. Knees up.

1167
01:24:43,675 --> 01:24:46,342
Yes, well done. Very good.

1168
01:24:50,633 --> 01:24:53,133
Come on. Very good, kiddo.
Buck up, India... buck up, India.

1169
01:24:56,967 --> 01:25:00,258
<i>I'll praise your words
I'll word your song</i>

1170
01:25:21,842 --> 01:25:22,800
Come on. Go for it.

1171
01:25:26,508 --> 01:25:27,467
<i>I'll...</i>

1172
01:25:28,592 --> 01:25:30,175
<i>I'll sing your praises</i>

1173
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:31,425
<i>I'll adorn myself</i>

1174
01:25:39,717 --> 01:25:41,633
Listen, you won't be able to do it.

1175
01:25:42,342 --> 01:25:43,883
Ranjeet will drop you off to the airport.

1176
01:25:47,133 --> 01:25:48,967
There's a huge difference
between singing at home,

1177
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:50,467
and singing in front of the mic.

1178
01:25:50,717 --> 01:25:52,050
It's not everyone's cup of tea.

1179
01:25:52,633 --> 01:25:54,758
You... go back to school.

1180
01:26:05,592 --> 01:26:07,592
Sir, I need to use the toilet.

1181
01:26:26,383 --> 01:26:29,467
- You know Insu, earlier,
he made such good songs.

1182
01:26:29,883 --> 01:26:31,633
- But nowadays,
when I listen to his songs,

1183
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,592
- it feels like he has remixed
some really nice song,

1184
01:26:34,925 --> 01:26:36,967
- and that nice song never got made.

1185
01:26:59,883 --> 01:27:01,550
I told you, she's not good enough.

1186
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:02,883
But you didn't listen.

1187
01:27:03,092 --> 01:27:04,758
As it is, no one wants to work with you.

1188
01:27:04,842 --> 01:27:06,425
Why are you trying to destroy my film?

1189
01:27:06,508 --> 01:27:08,467
I'll find someone.
- Who are you going to find?

1190
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:09,592
Should I sing it by myself?

1191
01:27:09,717 --> 01:27:12,508
Please leave this film. Spare me.
- Sir.

1192
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:15,342
Sir, can you step out
for a minute, please?

1193
01:27:15,467 --> 01:27:16,342
What is it?

1194
01:27:16,675 --> 01:27:18,383
I want to talk to you in private.

1195
01:27:25,883 --> 01:27:28,133
What's up? What's the problem?

1196
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:31,050
Sir, I feel the problem is not with me,
it's with your song.

1197
01:27:31,342 --> 01:27:32,175
I see.

1198
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:37,717
You mean there's no problem with you.

1199
01:27:38,508 --> 01:27:39,883
The problem is with my song.

1200
01:27:40,217 --> 01:27:41,800
Wow... wow! Amazing! I like it!

1201
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,383
That's a new one. Amazing!

1202
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:46,008
Sir, I'm not a professional singer.
- I can see that.

1203
01:27:46,342 --> 01:27:47,842
Sir, actually I'm a listener.

1204
01:27:48,883 --> 01:27:49,925
Ever since I was born...

1205
01:27:50,008 --> 01:27:52,717
my mom made me listen
to Bollywood songs... new, old, all!

1206
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:53,717
So?

1207
01:27:53,925 --> 01:27:54,883
What am I supposed to do?

1208
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,550
I've no interest in your nonsense.

1209
01:28:00,467 --> 01:28:02,508
But you should be interested
in my nonsense!

1210
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:10,592
I read in the news,

1211
01:28:10,842 --> 01:28:12,717
that the Singers' Association
has boycotted you.

1212
01:28:12,883 --> 01:28:15,842
Who are they to boycott me?
I boycott them. Scram! Boycott!

1213
01:28:15,925 --> 01:28:17,508
Sir, let me finish.

1214
01:28:17,925 --> 01:28:20,217
Your song is a romantic song,
but the tune is upbeat.

1215
01:28:20,425 --> 01:28:23,008
The lyrics are good,
but you've ruined them with innuendos.

1216
01:28:23,425 --> 01:28:27,925
It feels like a remixed version
of a great song, which never got made!

1217
01:28:28,633 --> 01:28:30,467
My mom says that, too.

1218
01:28:31,258 --> 01:28:33,258
This song should be one

1219
01:28:33,467 --> 01:28:34,592
from the heart...
- 2007.

1220
01:28:36,467 --> 01:28:37,342
What?

1221
01:28:38,383 --> 01:28:40,842
I made this song ten years ago in 2007.

1222
01:28:42,675 --> 01:28:43,925
This is the remix version.

1223
01:28:45,508 --> 01:28:47,050
The producer kept asking for a party song.

1224
01:28:47,467 --> 01:28:48,592
I spun it around.

1225
01:28:52,217 --> 01:28:53,175
This isn't the original.

1226
01:28:55,592 --> 01:28:59,133
<i>Your words and thoughtsWill flow from me</i>

1227
01:29:00,592 --> 01:29:04,300
<i>In your praise and devotionWill I always sing</i>

1228
01:29:05,258 --> 01:29:10,550
<i>In robes weaved of your love
I'll dress myself</i>

1229
01:29:10,633 --> 01:29:15,133
<i>And merge into your colors</i>

1230
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:21,008
<i>With ornaments bejeweled with your love
I'll decorate myself</i>

1231
01:29:21,092 --> 01:29:25,508
<i>And merge into your radiance</i>

1232
01:29:26,008 --> 01:29:28,717
<i>I dance wild and free</i>

1233
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:34,842
<i>Adorned in you, my love!</i>

1234
01:29:38,508 --> 01:29:39,633
Sir, this is what I will sing.

1235
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:41,050
Exactly this way.

1236
01:29:45,842 --> 01:29:48,508
Nowadays, everyone wants a fast song.

1237
01:29:48,758 --> 01:29:50,592
Sir, that's not true.

1238
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:52,883
Have you heard the songs of Aashiqui 2?

1239
01:29:53,050 --> 01:29:55,175
There are no fast songs in the album.
Yet it was a super hit.

1240
01:30:00,258 --> 01:30:02,592
So sir, let me try it once.

1241
01:30:02,717 --> 01:30:04,633
I'll sing it just the way you did.

1242
01:30:04,717 --> 01:30:06,425
The producer won't agree.

1243
01:30:06,592 --> 01:30:08,050
Sir, let me try once.

1244
01:30:08,258 --> 01:30:10,092
Not with 'body language',
but from the heart.

1245
01:30:10,592 --> 01:30:11,883
Just once. For my sake?

1246
01:30:12,008 --> 01:30:12,842
I see.

1247
01:30:13,258 --> 01:30:14,175
For your sake?

1248
01:30:16,967 --> 01:30:19,175
Sir, it's a lovely song.

1249
01:30:19,758 --> 01:30:22,092
But can I remove the word 'sexy', please?

1250
01:30:22,425 --> 01:30:24,300
Shakti had added that word.

1251
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:26,342
Remove it.

1252
01:30:26,633 --> 01:30:27,925
Ali, cancel this session.

1253
01:30:28,008 --> 01:30:30,550
Load the one from 2007. The old one.

1254
01:30:31,883 --> 01:30:33,508
I'm trying a new version. Check it out.

1255
01:30:33,633 --> 01:30:35,383
Sir, the slow version?

1256
01:30:35,592 --> 01:30:36,675
Why? Do you have a problem?

1257
01:31:08,425 --> 01:31:12,758
<i>Your words and thoughts
Will flow from me</i>

1258
01:31:14,008 --> 01:31:18,675
<i>In your praise and devotion
Will I always sing</i>

1259
01:31:19,217 --> 01:31:24,633
<i>In robes weaved of your love
I'll dress myself</i>

1260
01:31:24,758 --> 01:31:29,883
<i>And merge into your colors</i>

1261
01:31:30,258 --> 01:31:35,758
<i>With ornaments bejeweled with your love
I'll decorate myself</i>

1262
01:31:35,883 --> 01:31:40,800
<i>And merge into your radiance</i>

1263
01:31:40,883 --> 01:31:47,467
<i>I dance wild and free
Adorned in you, my love</i>

1264
01:31:52,092 --> 01:31:58,550
<i>I dance wild and free
Resonating with you, my love</i>

1265
01:32:26,217 --> 01:32:31,383
<i>I've lost my bearings
The world taunts</i>

1266
01:32:31,467 --> 01:32:36,425
<i>I'm beyond consciousness, beyond reason
I've lost myself, they say</i>

1267
01:32:36,633 --> 01:32:41,550
<i>I've lost my identity to you
They scorn me</i>

1268
01:32:42,967 --> 01:32:48,092
<i>But what do they know
The mysteries of this heart?</i>

1269
01:32:48,175 --> 01:32:50,925
<i>By losing myself</i>

1270
01:32:51,008 --> 01:32:53,217
<i>And realizing you</i>

1271
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:58,550
<i>I've found myself, I'm complete
I'm one with myself.</i>

1272
01:33:00,133 --> 01:33:04,008
<i>I'll abandon all ties
And come to you</i>

1273
01:33:05,633 --> 01:33:09,800
<i>All evil aimed at you
Let it befall me</i>

1274
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:16,258
<i>In robes weaved of your love
I'll dress myself</i>

1275
01:33:16,342 --> 01:33:20,800
<i>And merge into your colors</i>

1276
01:33:22,008 --> 01:33:27,508
<i>With ornaments bejeweled with your love
I'll decorate myself</i>

1277
01:33:27,592 --> 01:33:31,717
<i>And merge into your radiance</i>

1278
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:39,008
<i>I dance wild and free
Adorned in you, my love</i>

1279
01:33:43,758 --> 01:33:50,217
<i>I dance wild and free
Resonating with you, my love</i>

1280
01:34:17,258 --> 01:34:23,592
<i>I dance wild and free
Adorned in you, my love</i>

1281
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:35,008
<i>I dance wild and free
Resonating with you, my love</i>

1282
01:34:57,508 --> 01:34:58,467
Wow!

1283
01:35:02,467 --> 01:35:04,467
You have no idea
how I'm feeling right now.

1284
01:35:05,717 --> 01:35:08,383
I feel as though
this was the first recording of my life.

1285
01:35:10,633 --> 01:35:11,675
You won't understand.

1286
01:35:12,675 --> 01:35:15,925
Sir, actually this really was
the first recording of my life.

1287
01:35:16,050 --> 01:35:20,383
<i>With ornaments bejeweled with your love
I'll decorate myself</i>

1288
01:35:25,342 --> 01:35:27,717
Sir, I want to discuss something with you.

1289
01:35:28,633 --> 01:35:30,133
Yes, tell me. What is it?

1290
01:35:30,842 --> 01:35:32,883
Sir, I want your help.

1291
01:35:36,217 --> 01:35:37,508
Your fees, yes. Sorry.

1292
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:39,633
Your friend's name is... Yes, Chintan.

1293
01:35:40,258 --> 01:35:43,550
Should I send him your check?
- No, sir. I don't want money.

1294
01:35:43,758 --> 01:35:45,758
I just need your help.

1295
01:35:47,383 --> 01:35:51,925
Kiddo, once this song releases,
you won't need anyone's help.

1296
01:35:52,967 --> 01:35:56,758
Producers and music composers
will line up outside your house.

1297
01:35:57,550 --> 01:35:59,008
Sir, aren't you divorced?

1298
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:05,008
What do you mean?

1299
01:36:05,217 --> 01:36:06,925
Your wife left you.

1300
01:36:07,425 --> 01:36:09,008
She's taken your kids, too.

1301
01:36:09,258 --> 01:36:10,092
Yes, so?

1302
01:36:10,425 --> 01:36:12,258
I want to meet your wife's lawyer.

1303
01:36:12,967 --> 01:36:14,925
I want to get my parents divorced.

1304
01:36:15,758 --> 01:36:16,800
What? Why?

1305
01:36:23,008 --> 01:36:24,342
I'm sorry. I can understand.

1306
01:36:25,758 --> 01:36:27,050
Don't worry. I'll help you.

1307
01:36:27,258 --> 01:36:29,508
I'll call my lawyer right away.
Kamlesh is a fantastic lawyer.

1308
01:36:29,592 --> 01:36:31,842
No, sir. Not your lawyer.
But your wife's lawyer.

1309
01:36:32,342 --> 01:36:33,717
Who? Sheena Sabavala?

1310
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:34,758
She's crazy.

1311
01:36:35,842 --> 01:36:37,342
Sir, you promised.

1312
01:36:37,425 --> 01:36:39,008
Yes, and I'm not refusing you.

1313
01:36:39,217 --> 01:36:40,633
I'm helping you.

1314
01:36:42,675 --> 01:36:45,342
Hi, Kamlesh.
- Your 'fantastic' lawyer lost your case.

1315
01:36:51,133 --> 01:36:54,300
Kamlesh... listen... I'll...
I'll call you back.

1316
01:37:18,425 --> 01:37:21,592
What do you mean by 'Who?'
Don't pretend you don't know. Hello!

1317
01:37:24,050 --> 01:37:25,758
I know you're busy. I'm not free either.

1318
01:37:25,842 --> 01:37:27,008
I haven't called for small talk.

1319
01:37:27,092 --> 01:37:28,467
I have important work. Need to meet.

1320
01:37:28,675 --> 01:37:29,717
We'll talk when we meet.

1321
01:37:31,217 --> 01:37:33,633
No, this isn't about my divorce.

1322
01:37:33,717 --> 01:37:34,633
It's another matter.

1323
01:37:34,717 --> 01:37:36,925
It's about a girl...

1324
01:37:38,633 --> 01:37:41,050
Age? What's your age?
- I'm 15.

1325
01:37:41,217 --> 01:37:42,383
She's 15 years old.

1326
01:37:46,217 --> 01:37:47,925
How can you even think like that?

1327
01:37:48,175 --> 01:37:50,050
You've gone crazy. You're mad!

1328
01:37:56,175 --> 01:37:57,508
I will take you to the Supreme Court.

1329
01:38:16,633 --> 01:38:18,175
I tried. You saw me.

1330
01:38:18,717 --> 01:38:19,800
You saw what happened.

1331
01:38:46,383 --> 01:38:47,258
Hello, Sheena.

1332
01:38:49,092 --> 01:38:49,967
Listen to me.

1333
01:38:52,008 --> 01:38:54,592
I'm an ill-mannered person. You're right.

1334
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:58,925
Listen to me, babes! I'm begging you.

1335
01:38:59,008 --> 01:39:01,508
Not for me. It's for this little girl.
This innocent child.

1336
01:39:01,592 --> 01:39:02,508
Please.

1337
01:39:02,592 --> 01:39:04,467
She just needs half an hour. That's all.

1338
01:39:04,550 --> 01:39:05,550
Can we come now?

1339
01:39:07,883 --> 01:39:08,800
Next month?

1340
01:39:09,758 --> 01:39:12,217
No, babes, that's too late.

1341
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:14,342
Next week? It's an emergency.

1342
01:39:14,425 --> 01:39:15,300
Next week?

1343
01:39:17,050 --> 01:39:17,967
Next week, good.

1344
01:39:23,550 --> 01:39:24,383
Witch!

1345
01:39:29,967 --> 01:39:31,717
So, see you next week.

1346
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:34,883
I'll send your ticket to your boyfriend.

1347
01:39:34,967 --> 01:39:36,342
What's his name? Yes, Chintan.

1348
01:39:37,383 --> 01:39:39,383
Sir, he's not my boyfriend.
- What?

1349
01:39:39,925 --> 01:39:41,008
He's not your boyfriend?

1350
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:44,217
Then why are you blushing?

1351
01:39:57,550 --> 01:39:58,508
Chintan!

1352
01:40:08,592 --> 01:40:11,133
Mom, the materials I need
for my project are missing.

1353
01:40:11,508 --> 01:40:13,133
Insu. We bought it just a few days ago.

1354
01:40:13,717 --> 01:40:15,800
Where can it disappear?
Did you leave it in school?

1355
01:40:16,883 --> 01:40:19,050
Mom, how will I complete
my school project now?

1356
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:22,008
Guddu, get ready for bed.

1357
01:40:22,258 --> 01:40:23,217
Guddu...

1358
01:40:24,508 --> 01:40:26,133
Have you seen my glue bottle?

1359
01:40:29,425 --> 01:40:30,425
And my brown tape?

1360
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:33,258
No?

1361
01:40:35,383 --> 01:40:37,008
Do you want me to slap you?

1362
01:40:38,550 --> 01:40:40,383
Mom, tell him not to touch my stuff.

1363
01:40:40,467 --> 01:40:43,883
Guddu, how many times have I told you
not to touch her things?

1364
01:40:43,967 --> 01:40:45,925
I was making a gift for Insu.

1365
01:40:46,133 --> 01:40:47,717
There's no need to make me a gift.

1366
01:40:56,217 --> 01:40:57,133
Airport, please.

1367
01:41:06,592 --> 01:41:07,592
Come, kiddo.

1368
01:41:11,092 --> 01:41:14,217
Babe, tell Sheena that Shakti is here.

1369
01:41:15,050 --> 01:41:16,092
She's busy.

1370
01:41:16,467 --> 01:41:18,008
Please wait.
- Oh. Busy?

1371
01:41:19,967 --> 01:41:20,842
"Please wait."

1372
01:41:22,050 --> 01:41:22,925
Come, kiddo.

1373
01:41:38,175 --> 01:41:40,175
Oh my... I'm heart broken.

1374
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:42,633
No, thanks.

1375
01:41:43,633 --> 01:41:45,008
I'm better off "thirsty".

1376
01:42:01,675 --> 01:42:02,508
You go.

1377
01:42:17,550 --> 01:42:18,508
Ma'am.

1378
01:42:20,008 --> 01:42:20,967
My dad...

1379
01:42:21,383 --> 01:42:25,342
he beats my mother...
for every little thing.

1380
01:42:26,842 --> 01:42:29,967
Once, Mom forgot to turn on
the water heater.

1381
01:42:30,467 --> 01:42:31,925
He fractured her bone.

1382
01:43:07,967 --> 01:43:10,383
Babes, have you heard my new song?

1383
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:13,217
Which one, 'Soft and Tender'?

1384
01:43:14,592 --> 01:43:15,550
No, that's old now.

1385
01:43:16,925 --> 01:43:17,758
The new song is...

1386
01:43:18,758 --> 01:43:19,592
'Rough and Ready'.

1387
01:43:21,383 --> 01:43:23,758
Look, Insia. This is a difficult case.

1388
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:27,175
Firstly, Guddu and you are minors.

1389
01:43:29,175 --> 01:43:32,967
Furthermore, your mom's
financial situation isn't strong.

1390
01:43:34,633 --> 01:43:37,342
Anyway, I will prepare a file for you.

1391
01:43:37,550 --> 01:43:38,425
Take it home.

1392
01:43:38,758 --> 01:43:40,842
Read it to your mom
and tell her what's written in it.

1393
01:43:41,175 --> 01:43:42,550
Explain it to her. Okay?

1394
01:43:42,633 --> 01:43:44,592
And then get her to sign on it.

1395
01:43:46,592 --> 01:43:47,508
Alright, ma'am.

1396
01:43:47,883 --> 01:43:52,258
The lines on your palm tells me
that there's a new love in your life.

1397
01:43:58,842 --> 01:43:59,675
Here.

1398
01:44:03,592 --> 01:44:05,758
Ma'am, I can't afford your fees...

1399
01:44:05,842 --> 01:44:08,050
Don't worry. She's a very cheap lawyer.

1400
01:44:08,758 --> 01:44:09,758
I'll handle it. Come.

1401
01:44:12,467 --> 01:44:13,383
Listen.

1402
01:44:18,008 --> 01:44:19,758
No, dear. I was talking to him.

1403
01:44:21,425 --> 01:44:23,675
Perhaps you are not as bad as you seem.

1404
01:44:39,342 --> 01:44:40,425
Sir, may I ask you something?

1405
01:44:41,967 --> 01:44:43,425
Why are you helping me?

1406
01:44:45,633 --> 01:44:46,633
Kiddo, actually...

1407
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:50,217
Our stories are very similar.

1408
01:44:51,050 --> 01:44:51,925
How's that?

1409
01:44:53,342 --> 01:44:57,508
You know, in the past ten years,
I've been divorced twice.

1410
01:44:59,008 --> 01:45:00,550
My brother sued me.

1411
01:45:02,008 --> 01:45:03,508
I pretty much have no family.

1412
01:45:04,592 --> 01:45:07,383
This film industry is my family.
It's my mom, sister., family..

1413
01:45:08,092 --> 01:45:13,008
And, this film industry too,
has never given me an ounce of love.

1414
01:45:14,967 --> 01:45:16,717
They nominate me every year,

1415
01:45:17,967 --> 01:45:19,175
but have never given me an award.

1416
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,967
How does this make our stories similar?

1417
01:45:25,217 --> 01:45:26,175
Anyways...

1418
01:45:26,883 --> 01:45:28,967
how did you learn to play the guitar?

1419
01:45:30,342 --> 01:45:31,425
I was six years old.

1420
01:45:31,883 --> 01:45:33,383
My mom got me a guitar.

1421
01:45:37,008 --> 01:45:38,633
Sir, I want to relocate to Mumbai.

1422
01:45:38,967 --> 01:45:40,008
With my mom.

1423
01:45:41,342 --> 01:45:43,508
I want proper training in music.

1424
01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:46,592
Then, maybe I can be
a part of Singing Idol, too.

1425
01:45:46,675 --> 01:45:49,133
Kids like you don't need Singing Idol.

1426
01:45:50,342 --> 01:45:51,883
Then how will I become a superstar?

1427
01:45:51,967 --> 01:45:53,300
You will become one anyway.

1428
01:45:54,383 --> 01:45:56,967
Talented kids like you are...

1429
01:45:58,967 --> 01:46:00,050
How do I explain?

1430
01:46:02,883 --> 01:46:04,092
You are like bubbles in soda.

1431
01:46:05,050 --> 01:46:06,133
You see these bubbles?

1432
01:46:07,133 --> 01:46:08,842
It's rising one by one, right?

1433
01:46:09,675 --> 01:46:10,508
So?

1434
01:46:11,842 --> 01:46:13,258
Talented kids are like that.

1435
01:46:13,883 --> 01:46:16,175
They rise like this. On their own.

1436
01:46:16,883 --> 01:46:17,842
Nothing can stop them.

1437
01:46:30,633 --> 01:46:31,592
No problem, kiddo.

1438
01:46:31,967 --> 01:46:33,925
Just call me
if you have any problems, okay?

1439
01:46:34,508 --> 01:46:37,883
Tell Chintan to give me a missed call
once you've reached home safely.

1440
01:47:00,342 --> 01:47:01,258
Take care, kiddo.

1441
01:47:32,092 --> 01:47:33,758
Mom, get down, I want to talk to you.

1442
01:47:33,925 --> 01:47:34,925
Not now, Insu.

1443
01:47:35,008 --> 01:47:36,550
Hurry up and start chopping
the vegetables.

1444
01:47:36,633 --> 01:47:38,008
Mom, get down.

1445
01:47:38,592 --> 01:47:41,133
Not now. Later...
- Mom, it's very important. Get down.

1446
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:42,675
Goodness.

1447
01:47:43,675 --> 01:47:44,633
What is it?

1448
01:47:45,050 --> 01:47:45,967
Sit.

1449
01:47:46,717 --> 01:47:48,883
Mom, I... I had gone to Mumbai.

1450
01:47:49,175 --> 01:47:51,883
Shakti Kumaarr, the composer,
had sent me an email.

1451
01:47:52,008 --> 01:47:54,508
He called me to Mumbai to record a song.

1452
01:47:54,592 --> 01:47:55,883
The recording went very well.

1453
01:47:55,967 --> 01:47:58,508
After that Mr. Shakti got me
to meet a lawyer.

1454
01:47:58,592 --> 01:48:00,133
She's a famous lawyer in Mumbai.

1455
01:48:00,675 --> 01:48:02,800
She has given me these divorce papers.

1456
01:48:03,550 --> 01:48:04,758
Please take a look at them.

1457
01:48:07,675 --> 01:48:09,508
Mom, please leave Dad.

1458
01:48:09,883 --> 01:48:11,758
Then we won't have to go to Saudi Arabia.

1459
01:48:11,883 --> 01:48:13,425
I'll become a famous singer.

1460
01:48:13,717 --> 01:48:15,592
And Mr. Shakti said that he would help.

1461
01:48:21,467 --> 01:48:22,550
You went to Mumbai?

1462
01:48:24,467 --> 01:48:25,342
When?

1463
01:48:26,092 --> 01:48:27,925
Last week. And today.

1464
01:48:28,508 --> 01:48:29,758
Mom, the plan is ready.

1465
01:48:29,842 --> 01:48:30,758
In a plane?

1466
01:48:31,675 --> 01:48:32,550
Alone?

1467
01:48:34,342 --> 01:48:35,217
And school?

1468
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:38,550
Mom, I was going to tell you, but...
- Have you grown up so much,

1469
01:48:39,758 --> 01:48:41,050
that you'll go to Mumbai alone?

1470
01:48:41,383 --> 01:48:42,925
You'll get your parents divorced?

1471
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:44,717
But Mom, I told you that I had a plan.

1472
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:45,967
What were you thinking?

1473
01:48:46,383 --> 01:48:49,800
If something had happened to you,
how would I know?

1474
01:48:50,758 --> 01:48:52,300
You met a lawyer, too!

1475
01:48:52,883 --> 01:48:54,383
What were you thinking?

1476
01:48:54,550 --> 01:48:56,217
You thought,
you'll get your parents divorced?

1477
01:48:56,467 --> 01:48:58,508
Did you ask me
whether I want a divorce or not?

1478
01:48:58,758 --> 01:49:00,633
And what is this nonsense about divorce?

1479
01:49:01,092 --> 01:49:02,508
What has your dad done?

1480
01:49:02,717 --> 01:49:04,550
Don't you know what he has done?

1481
01:49:05,508 --> 01:49:07,050
He beats you up all the time.

1482
01:49:07,133 --> 01:49:08,842
He has a bad temper.

1483
01:49:09,092 --> 01:49:11,633
-He doesn't have control. Which man...
-Please, Mom!

1484
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:13,800
What sort of a life are we living?

1485
01:49:14,217 --> 01:49:16,092
We aren't even allowed to breathe.

1486
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:17,883
Now, he will take us to Saudi.

1487
01:49:18,092 --> 01:49:20,758
Marry me off to someone like him.
Without even asking me.

1488
01:49:21,133 --> 01:49:23,967
-I'll suffer the same fate as you.
-Insu.

1489
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:28,175
Everyone has their limitations.
- But I don't, Mom.

1490
01:49:29,008 --> 01:49:31,550
Mom, trust me. I'll make everything okay.

1491
01:49:31,633 --> 01:49:32,842
What will you do?

1492
01:49:34,258 --> 01:49:36,467
My father didn't ask me
before getting me married.

1493
01:49:37,508 --> 01:49:39,717
My daughter didn't ask me
if I want a divorce.

1494
01:49:40,717 --> 01:49:42,675
No one cares about what I want.

1495
01:49:42,758 --> 01:49:43,883
Whatever, Mom!

1496
01:49:44,258 --> 01:49:46,258
I won't go to Saudi.
- That's it, Insu.

1497
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:48,633
This is my world.

1498
01:49:49,342 --> 01:49:51,133
And this is your world, too!

1499
01:49:52,467 --> 01:49:55,717
And in our reality, I've given you
as much freedom as I could.

1500
01:49:58,967 --> 01:50:00,633
But, don't dream of flying beyond this.

1501
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:02,217
Don't!

1502
01:50:03,550 --> 01:50:05,592
We are going to Saudi with your dad.

1503
01:50:06,217 --> 01:50:08,592
I won't let your education stop,
I promise.

1504
01:50:08,675 --> 01:50:11,217
But my dream of becoming a singer
will never come true.

1505
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:12,675
Don't argue with me.

1506
01:50:13,425 --> 01:50:16,300
We are going to Saudi with your dad.

1507
01:50:16,383 --> 01:50:17,925
I won't go to Saudi.

1508
01:50:18,467 --> 01:50:21,050
I can't believe how you can be so stupid.

1509
01:50:21,467 --> 01:50:23,092
Doesn't it make any difference to you?

1510
01:50:23,425 --> 01:50:25,758
My life will be wasted, Mom.

1511
01:50:26,258 --> 01:50:28,967
You are such a coward that
you can't do anything for your daughter!

1512
01:51:51,008 --> 01:51:52,008
The gift?

1513
01:51:53,508 --> 01:51:54,842
It isn't ready yet.

1514
01:52:21,508 --> 01:52:24,008
Give it to me. It's not done yet.

1515
01:52:25,592 --> 01:52:26,508
Insia.

1516
01:52:27,342 --> 01:52:29,300
Now apologize to your mom.

1517
01:52:29,508 --> 01:52:31,050
I won't apologize to mom.

1518
01:52:31,883 --> 01:52:33,383
It's her fault. Not mine.

1519
01:52:33,633 --> 01:52:37,175
Her biggest mistake
is that she gave birth to you.

1520
01:52:38,883 --> 01:52:40,758
Your dad had said,

1521
01:52:41,883 --> 01:52:44,925
"What will you do with a girl?"

1522
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:46,758
"Abort her."

1523
01:52:47,717 --> 01:52:49,258
Najma was adamant.

1524
01:52:50,050 --> 01:52:52,258
Everyone beat her up.

1525
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,633
They dragged her to the doctor.

1526
01:52:56,967 --> 01:52:57,800
Then?

1527
01:52:57,883 --> 01:53:01,050
The doctor said, "It's late today."

1528
01:53:01,258 --> 01:53:03,425
"We will operate on her tomorrow."

1529
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:06,217
They kept her in the hospital all night.

1530
01:53:06,550 --> 01:53:07,883
Didn't you say anything?

1531
01:53:08,383 --> 01:53:11,508
I constantly wonder

1532
01:53:12,050 --> 01:53:16,550
why my mother didn't abort me?

1533
01:53:17,425 --> 01:53:19,842
What good has my life been?

1534
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:22,300
And mom? The operation?

1535
01:53:22,633 --> 01:53:25,092
The next day,
when we went to the hospital,

1536
01:53:25,633 --> 01:53:28,133
your mom had escaped.

1537
01:53:29,258 --> 01:53:30,758
Ten months later,

1538
01:53:31,925 --> 01:53:34,175
when she returned with you,

1539
01:53:34,925 --> 01:53:39,883
she said, "Next time if it's a girl,
we could abort."

1540
01:53:40,425 --> 01:53:42,008
"Let's keep her."

1541
01:53:42,383 --> 01:53:44,300
"This is my Insia."

1542
01:53:45,175 --> 01:53:46,425
Where was I born?

1543
01:53:46,842 --> 01:53:47,883
And where was Mom?

1544
01:53:48,383 --> 01:53:50,300
How does it matter?

1545
01:53:51,925 --> 01:53:55,425
After all, it's your mom's fault,
not yours. Right?

1546
01:53:56,633 --> 01:53:58,842
Why should you apologize?

1547
01:54:02,258 --> 01:54:03,383
Listen.

1548
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:07,883
Najma never wanted you to know all this.

1549
01:54:08,758 --> 01:54:10,175
Don't tell her you know.

1550
01:54:11,092 --> 01:54:12,008
Do you understand?

1551
01:54:12,967 --> 01:54:13,883
But...

1552
01:54:13,967 --> 01:54:17,842
The joy I'm having in telling you this

1553
01:54:19,050 --> 01:54:23,592
is nothing compared to the joy
your mom gets in keeping this from you.

1554
01:55:12,508 --> 01:55:18,842
<i>This great big world
Suddenly seems so small </i>

1555
01:55:22,758 --> 01:55:28,883
<i>I took flight only to crash
Into a glass ceiling </i>

1556
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:36,675
<i>O my heart, stop insisting</i>

1557
01:55:37,050 --> 01:55:42,133
<i>O my heart, stop insisting</i>

1558
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:47,758
<i>Lock your cage from within</i>

1559
01:55:48,050 --> 01:55:51,883
<i>Along with your dreams </i>

1560
01:55:52,383 --> 01:55:57,300
<i>O my heart, stop insisting</i>

1561
01:55:57,550 --> 01:56:02,508
<i>O my heart, stop insisting</i>

1562
01:56:02,758 --> 01:56:08,425
<i>Lock your cage from within</i>

1563
01:56:08,675 --> 01:56:13,092
<i>Along with your dreams </i>

1564
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:15,800
I've spoken to Sheena.

1565
01:56:16,342 --> 01:56:18,258
There are many ways.
You can lodge a police complaint.

1566
01:56:18,592 --> 01:56:20,300
A children's organization here
can help you.

1567
01:56:20,425 --> 01:56:21,258
There's Sheena.

1568
01:56:21,508 --> 01:56:23,092
There's me.
You don't need to waste your life.

1569
01:56:23,758 --> 01:56:26,050
Sir, my mom didn't give up on me.

1570
01:56:29,175 --> 01:56:30,258
It's my turn now.

1571
01:56:31,008 --> 01:56:32,425
How can I desert her?

1572
01:56:32,967 --> 01:56:33,842
But...

1573
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:35,383
What about you, Insia?

1574
01:56:35,675 --> 01:56:37,092
Why are you wasting your talent?

1575
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:42,133
<i>O my heart, stop insisting</i>

1576
01:56:42,467 --> 01:56:47,633
<i>O my heart, stop insisting</i>

1577
01:56:47,717 --> 01:56:53,467
<i>Lock your cage from within</i>

1578
01:56:53,633 --> 01:56:58,842
<i>Along with your dreams</i>

1579
01:56:58,925 --> 01:57:02,800
<i>Along with your dreams</i>

1580
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:06,050
<i>Secret Superstar!</i>

1581
01:57:06,383 --> 01:57:08,800
<i>Friends, a few months ago, </i>

1582
01:57:08,883 --> 01:57:10,967
<i>a mystery girl wearing a burqa,</i>

1583
01:57:11,133 --> 01:57:12,758
<i>uploaded her songs
on her YouTube channel. </i>

1584
01:57:14,175 --> 01:57:17,883
<i>These videos became so popular
that even celebrities and politicians</i>

1585
01:57:18,092 --> 01:57:20,133
<i>appreciated and shared them.</i>

1586
01:57:20,842 --> 01:57:23,425
<i>But a few weeks ago,
this YouTube channel went dormant.</i>

1587
01:57:23,508 --> 01:57:24,633
<i>No more songs!</i>

1588
01:57:25,300 --> 01:57:28,175
<i>There was silence on her
YouTube, Facebook, Twitter pages. </i>

1589
01:57:28,925 --> 01:57:31,550
<i>'Come Back Secret Superstar' pages
began trending,</i>

1590
01:57:31,633 --> 01:57:34,092
<i>and all her fans were upset. </i>

1591
01:57:35,050 --> 01:57:38,050
<i>But today, there is reason to rejoice. </i>

1592
01:57:38,342 --> 01:57:42,133
<i>Because our Secret Superstar
has set foot into the world of Bollywood.</i>

1593
01:57:42,883 --> 01:57:45,883
<i>Let's talk to Shakti Kumaarr about her.</i>

1594
01:57:46,217 --> 01:57:48,300
<i>- Sir, tell us something
about the Secret Superstar.</i>

1595
01:57:50,883 --> 01:57:54,092
<i>There's a pain in her voice
that stems from her heart.</i>

1596
01:57:55,050 --> 01:57:58,300
<i>Her eyes have a passion
that transcends into her voice. </i>

1597
01:57:59,967 --> 01:58:02,758
<i>She's blessed by Jesus.
She's a gifted child... gifted!</i>

1598
01:58:03,217 --> 01:58:04,383
<i>What's her real name?</i>

1599
01:58:04,675 --> 01:58:05,758
How does it matter?

1600
01:58:06,092 --> 01:58:07,383
Her voice is real!

1601
01:58:08,300 --> 01:58:09,800
<i>Will she sing more songs for you?</i>

1602
01:58:10,133 --> 01:58:11,508
<i>God willing!</i>

1603
01:58:11,842 --> 01:58:13,758
'I dance!'

1604
01:58:15,133 --> 01:58:16,092
'I dance!'

1605
01:58:19,883 --> 01:58:23,675
<i>Your words and thoughts
Will flow from me</i>

1606
01:58:25,217 --> 01:58:28,883
<i>In your praise and devotion
Will I always sing</i>

1607
01:58:30,258 --> 01:58:35,675
<i>In robes weaved of your love
I'll dress myself</i>

1608
01:58:35,758 --> 01:58:39,800
<i>And merge into your colors</i>

1609
01:58:39,883 --> 01:58:41,050
Insu...

1610
01:58:45,592 --> 01:58:47,258
Mom, I don't want to dream any more.

1611
01:58:57,925 --> 01:58:59,300
Isn't school over?

1612
01:59:00,133 --> 01:59:01,050
No, Dad.

1613
01:59:01,675 --> 01:59:02,758
Today is the last day.

1614
01:59:03,008 --> 01:59:04,258
When are your exams starting?

1615
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:07,342
From the fifth of the next month.

1616
01:59:07,675 --> 01:59:08,675
And when do they end?

1617
01:59:09,258 --> 01:59:10,383
On the 20th.

1618
01:59:10,925 --> 01:59:13,758
Alright, I'll book the tickets for 20th.

1619
01:59:14,133 --> 01:59:15,425
Start packing.

1620
01:59:15,633 --> 01:59:17,467
Don't leave anything for the last minute.

1621
01:59:17,633 --> 01:59:18,550
Okay?

1622
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:27,217
I'll write it.
You wrote even the last time.

1623
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:28,175
It's my turn now.

1624
01:59:28,967 --> 01:59:30,967
-My turn.
-No.

1625
01:59:38,467 --> 01:59:39,425
Shall I write something?

1626
01:59:51,925 --> 01:59:53,717
Are your tickets booked?

1627
01:59:54,258 --> 01:59:55,092
Insu.

1628
01:59:56,883 --> 01:59:57,758
Shall we go?

1629
02:00:14,217 --> 02:00:15,675
Ma'am, just a minute.

1630
02:00:16,550 --> 02:00:17,550
I'm Chintan.

1631
02:00:18,008 --> 02:00:18,883
Insia's friend.

1632
02:00:19,883 --> 02:00:22,175
The 'pav bhaji' that you sent
for lunch the other day was amazing.

1633
02:00:23,050 --> 02:00:24,425
I didn't let Insia have it.

1634
02:00:24,508 --> 02:00:25,592
I finished everything.

1635
02:00:28,675 --> 02:00:29,800
Will you have ice cream?

1636
02:00:31,467 --> 02:00:32,383
No.

1637
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:36,383
Ma'am, today is the last day of school.

1638
02:00:37,425 --> 02:00:40,258
So, if you don't mind,
can Insia and I go for ice cream?

1639
02:00:41,050 --> 02:00:42,300
We'll be back in ten minutes.

1640
02:00:44,092 --> 02:00:45,633
Promise. Please?

1641
02:00:45,842 --> 02:00:46,758
Please?

1642
02:00:50,258 --> 02:00:52,550
Go.
- Thank you, ma'am. Let's go.

1643
02:00:52,633 --> 02:00:54,258
Go.
- Come.

1644
02:00:54,550 --> 02:00:57,175
Go!
- Come on.

1645
02:00:58,675 --> 02:00:59,550
Listen.

1646
02:01:04,883 --> 02:01:06,217
Your dad has gone to Ahmedabad.

1647
02:01:06,467 --> 02:01:07,758
He'll return late at night.

1648
02:01:08,217 --> 02:01:10,050
You can stay out longer,
but come back by evening.

1649
02:01:12,633 --> 02:01:13,633
Come.

1650
02:01:18,050 --> 02:01:20,883
Babes, your song has become a superhit.

1651
02:01:21,925 --> 02:01:23,342
Yes, sir. I've seen it.

1652
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:25,967
It's always shown on TV.

1653
02:01:26,217 --> 02:01:28,092
And Mom has bought its CD.

1654
02:01:28,633 --> 02:01:29,758
- There's more good news.

1655
02:01:29,842 --> 02:01:32,883
What?
- Glamour Awards has nominated you.

1656
02:01:33,925 --> 02:01:34,758
Best Singer.

1657
02:01:34,967 --> 02:01:36,883
What? Really?

1658
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:38,758
And me, too.
- Wow, sir.

1659
02:01:38,842 --> 02:01:40,133
I can't believe it.

1660
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:41,217
When is it?

1661
02:01:41,383 --> 02:01:42,717
On the 20th. In Mumbai.

1662
02:01:42,967 --> 02:01:43,925
You should come.

1663
02:01:45,008 --> 02:01:48,133
No, sir. I won't be able to come.
You know that.

1664
02:01:48,675 --> 02:01:50,550
But you will surely win the award.

1665
02:01:51,425 --> 02:01:52,592
Fat chance.

1666
02:01:53,217 --> 02:01:54,800
No, sir. Don't say that.

1667
02:01:55,092 --> 02:01:56,592
I'm sure, you will win it this time.

1668
02:01:58,258 --> 02:01:59,258
Listen.

1669
02:02:01,383 --> 02:02:03,383
Don't forget me when you go to Saudi.

1670
02:02:05,258 --> 02:02:06,175
Keep in touch.

1671
02:02:06,633 --> 02:02:08,008
How can I forget you?

1672
02:02:09,342 --> 02:02:10,758
You have done so much for me.

1673
02:02:12,092 --> 02:02:14,133
God bless, kiddo.

1674
02:02:21,008 --> 02:02:22,092
Don't be sad.

1675
02:02:22,508 --> 02:02:23,842
You are anyway the best singer.

1676
02:02:25,092 --> 02:02:26,342
And you, a best friend.

1677
02:02:30,217 --> 02:02:31,300
Let's celebrate today.

1678
02:02:31,675 --> 02:02:32,550
What?

1679
02:02:32,842 --> 02:02:34,383
I read on twitter...

1680
02:02:35,133 --> 02:02:38,425
"Don't cry it's over, smile it happened."

1681
02:02:39,008 --> 02:02:41,008
You read this on Twitter?
- Yes.

1682
02:02:41,842 --> 02:02:42,967
Who tweeted it?

1683
02:02:43,467 --> 02:02:45,050
Break up Quotations.

1684
02:02:46,842 --> 02:02:52,300
<i>At 7.30 in the morning</i>

1685
02:02:52,758 --> 02:02:57,967
<i>At 4.45 in the evening</i>

1686
02:02:58,050 --> 02:03:03,675
<i>When the first rains fall</i>

1687
02:03:03,758 --> 02:03:09,717
<i>When the summer holidays
Come to an end</i>

1688
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:14,050
<i>Sometimes in joy
Sometimes in sorrow</i>

1689
02:03:14,258 --> 02:03:18,508
<i>And sometimes for no reason at all</i>

1690
02:03:22,175 --> 02:03:24,550

<i>Whenever I pass by your house</i>

1695
02:04:09,508 --> 02:04:15,133
<i>I'll wait a little for you</i>

1696
02:04:15,217 --> 02:04:20,883
<i>I know, I won't see you there </i>

1697
02:04:20,967 --> 02:04:26,508
<i>I know, I'll end up getting delayed</i>

1698
02:04:32,633 --> 02:04:38,342
<i>When I have tea and cookies
In the morning</i>

1699
02:04:38,425 --> 02:04:43,717
<i>When I have cold coffee
In the evening</i>

1700
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:49,383

How did your exam go?

1706
02:05:17,467 --> 02:05:18,467
Good.

1707
02:05:19,758 --> 02:05:20,883
I'm going to Mumbai.

1708
02:05:21,633 --> 02:05:22,842
To attend the Glamour Awards.

1709
02:05:23,883 --> 02:05:25,383
Mr. Shakti has arranged a pass for me.

1710
02:05:34,217 --> 02:05:39,092
<i>I love you</i>

1711
02:05:39,425 --> 02:05:45,008
<i>I love you</i>

1712
02:05:59,883 --> 02:06:01,842
Sir, load this too.

1713
02:06:05,175 --> 02:06:06,092
Careful.

1714
02:06:26,008 --> 02:06:27,092
I need to use the toilet.

1715
02:06:27,258 --> 02:06:28,175
Hold this.

1716
02:06:29,508 --> 02:06:30,467
Watch the luggage.

1717
02:06:39,592 --> 02:06:40,592
I...

1718
02:06:45,467 --> 02:06:48,008
Ma'am, my husband has gone to the toilet.

1719
02:06:48,092 --> 02:06:49,175
He'll be back in two minutes.

1720
02:06:49,258 --> 02:06:50,925
No problem. Please step out of the queue.

1721
02:06:51,258 --> 02:06:52,592
No... please check these.

1722
02:06:52,675 --> 02:06:54,842
Mom, don't worry. I'll take care of it.

1723
02:06:56,050 --> 02:06:57,758
From here to Mumbai,
then Mumbai to Riyadh.

1724
02:06:57,842 --> 02:07:01,050
You'll get the boarding passes to Riyadh
at the Mumbai International airport.

1725
02:07:01,675 --> 02:07:04,717
You'll have to check in your bags
again at Mumbai airport.

1726
02:07:07,925 --> 02:07:08,967
I have another request.

1727
02:07:10,217 --> 02:07:11,800
These three seats together.

1728
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:13,592
And these two seats behind them.

1729
02:07:13,883 --> 02:07:14,800
Okay, ma'am.

1730
02:07:22,133 --> 02:07:23,050
Done?

1731
02:07:30,508 --> 02:07:31,425
Come on, then.

1732
02:07:36,133 --> 02:07:37,425
It happens every time.

1733
02:07:37,925 --> 02:07:39,717
Someone takes my window seat.

1734
02:07:43,550 --> 02:07:44,592
That's my seat.

1735
02:07:59,467 --> 02:08:00,717
Come, take the window seat.

1736
02:08:12,467 --> 02:08:16,717
<i>Monali Thakur, Sudha Venkat, Geet Singhal,
have been joined this time, </i>

1737
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:21,050
<i>by our first-time nominee,
Secret Superstar.</i>

1738
02:08:21,383 --> 02:08:23,008
<i>For her beautiful song...</i>

1739
02:08:23,092 --> 02:08:26,508
Secret Superstar sings really well.
- Yes.

1740
02:08:26,925 --> 02:08:28,383
She'll definitely win the award.

1741
02:08:28,550 --> 02:08:31,092
Yes, she should win the award.

1742
02:08:33,008 --> 02:08:34,425
Where are the rest of the passengers?

1743
02:08:37,883 --> 02:08:39,300
Hello!
- Yes.

1744
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:41,175
Why don't you dive into the television?

1745
02:08:41,342 --> 02:08:43,175
Come on.

1746
02:08:43,383 --> 02:08:44,258
Guddu, move to the side.

1747
02:08:44,342 --> 02:08:46,342
Stand here or you'll get hurt.

1748
02:08:47,092 --> 02:08:49,133
Sir, this needs a fragile tag.
- Okay.

1749
02:08:49,217 --> 02:08:52,175
On these two as well.
- I'll do it. Don't worry.

1750
02:08:57,758 --> 02:08:58,967
Sir, you have extra baggage.

1751
02:08:59,050 --> 02:09:00,217
You'll have to pay for it.

1752
02:09:00,508 --> 02:09:02,008
What rubbish!

1753
02:09:02,258 --> 02:09:04,342
Every bag is under 25kg.
I weighed them myself.

1754
02:09:04,425 --> 02:09:05,675
Sir, it is not about the weight.

1755
02:09:06,133 --> 02:09:07,467
You have an extra bag.

1756
02:09:08,342 --> 02:09:11,425
You are allowed to check in ten bags,
but you've checked in eleven bags.

1757
02:09:12,425 --> 02:09:14,133
How much will I have to pay?

1758
02:09:14,300 --> 02:09:15,550
Sir, 4,500 rupees.

1759
02:09:27,550 --> 02:09:28,425
What's this?

1760
02:09:29,133 --> 02:09:30,092
Where has this come from?

1761
02:09:30,842 --> 02:09:32,133
Tell me.
- It's Insu's guitar.

1762
02:09:32,342 --> 02:09:35,008
So? Are we taking her there
to play the guitar?

1763
02:09:36,508 --> 02:09:38,758
When will you both stop obsessing
over the guitar?

1764
02:09:41,550 --> 02:09:42,467
Insia.

1765
02:09:43,133 --> 02:09:45,050
Pick up the guitar.

1766
02:09:47,675 --> 02:09:50,050
Yes... and dump it in the dustbin.

1767
02:09:50,258 --> 02:09:51,133
Over there.

1768
02:09:52,592 --> 02:09:53,967
There is no need for a guitar there.

1769
02:09:58,050 --> 02:09:59,842
Do you think I'll pay 5,000 rupees
for that junk?

1770
02:10:12,592 --> 02:10:13,550
Listen...

1771
02:10:14,758 --> 02:10:17,383
Insu has nothing but her guitar.

1772
02:10:17,925 --> 02:10:20,633
There's so much luggage anyway,
so let's take her guitar too.

1773
02:10:20,967 --> 02:10:23,133
It's not a guitar, it's junk.

1774
02:10:23,633 --> 02:10:26,592
The same junk that's in both your heads.

1775
02:10:33,133 --> 02:10:34,133
It's not junk.

1776
02:10:34,842 --> 02:10:35,758
It's Insu's guitar.

1777
02:10:44,092 --> 02:10:45,717
If you say the word 'guitar' once more,

1778
02:10:45,800 --> 02:10:48,717
you have no idea,
how hard I'll slap you right here.

1779
02:10:50,050 --> 02:10:50,883
Get it?

1780
02:10:51,717 --> 02:10:52,842
In fact, it's not even a guitar.

1781
02:10:54,592 --> 02:10:55,508
It's Insia's dream.

1782
02:10:57,508 --> 02:10:59,342
And without dreams
there's no point to anything.

1783
02:11:02,008 --> 02:11:04,008
Neither to sleep, nor to wake up.

1784
02:11:04,425 --> 02:11:06,508
Neither to live, nor to die.

1785
02:11:07,758 --> 02:11:09,092
To dream is a basic right.

1786
02:11:09,633 --> 02:11:11,508
Everyone should be allowed this much.
- Hey!

1787
02:11:12,633 --> 02:11:13,550
Have you lost it?

1788
02:11:14,217 --> 02:11:16,550
I've told you once that
the guitar will stay here. That's it!

1789
02:11:21,675 --> 02:11:22,550
Alright.

1790
02:11:23,342 --> 02:11:24,342
The guitar will stay here.

1791
02:11:27,425 --> 02:11:28,342
Along with Insu,

1792
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:30,883
Guddu,

1793
02:11:32,050 --> 02:11:32,925
and me.

1794
02:11:36,008 --> 02:11:37,425
We are not coming to Riyadh with you.

1795
02:11:41,258 --> 02:11:42,092
Hold it!

1796
02:11:46,217 --> 02:11:47,717
There are cameras everywhere.

1797
02:11:49,217 --> 02:11:50,758
If you hit me,

1798
02:11:52,508 --> 02:11:55,592
we'll take the footage from security
and upload it on YouTube.

1799
02:11:57,258 --> 02:11:58,550
Insu has a channel on it.

1800
02:11:59,967 --> 02:12:00,925
Haven't you seen it on TV?

1801
02:12:01,550 --> 02:12:02,633
The burqa clad girl.

1802
02:12:03,425 --> 02:12:05,092
The one who sings and plays the guitar.

1803
02:12:06,133 --> 02:12:07,133
She has millions of fans.

1804
02:12:08,217 --> 02:12:09,342
They'll all see you.

1805
02:12:11,133 --> 02:12:12,383
Before any of this happens,

1806
02:12:13,633 --> 02:12:16,133
it's best that you go to Riyadh.

1807
02:12:31,758 --> 02:12:33,633
Enough is enough! Stop this nonsense.

1808
02:12:34,217 --> 02:12:35,342
I'm your husband.

1809
02:12:35,592 --> 02:12:37,717
You can't move from here
without my permission.

1810
02:12:38,717 --> 02:12:39,592
Hold this, Insu.

1811
02:12:42,925 --> 02:12:44,217
What's happening? Can't you hear me?

1812
02:12:45,175 --> 02:12:47,175
Can't you hear or have you gone deaf?

1813
02:12:47,508 --> 02:12:48,633
Why are you opening this bag?

1814
02:12:49,425 --> 02:12:50,425
What's this?

1815
02:12:50,633 --> 02:12:51,633
What file is this?

1816
02:12:52,633 --> 02:12:54,758
Can't you hear me?
I'm talking to you. Look here.

1817
02:12:55,883 --> 02:12:57,508
What are you doing?

1818
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:00,925
What file is this?
What are you signing on?

1819
02:13:01,133 --> 02:13:02,842
What are you signing on?

1820
02:13:02,925 --> 02:13:04,467
What's this?

1821
02:13:06,133 --> 02:13:07,092
I can't read.

1822
02:13:07,425 --> 02:13:08,258
You can.

1823
02:13:09,675 --> 02:13:11,967
It's written here
that if I complain to the police,

1824
02:13:12,758 --> 02:13:13,800
you'll be arrested.

1825
02:13:17,675 --> 02:13:18,967
You'll definitely lose the children.

1826
02:13:19,967 --> 02:13:21,175
I might get your house, too.

1827
02:13:23,758 --> 02:13:26,633
If you get arrested,
you'll lose your job in Riyadh.

1828
02:13:27,633 --> 02:13:28,717
And your life will be ruined.

1829
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:31,133
Why take the risk?

1830
02:13:34,133 --> 02:13:37,675
It's best you go from here
and leave us alone.

1831
02:13:40,717 --> 02:13:41,592
Come on, Insu.

1832
02:13:49,133 --> 02:13:50,758
- Sir, are you checking in?

1833
02:13:50,925 --> 02:13:52,300
- Shall I give your boarding passes?

1834
02:13:53,092 --> 02:13:55,508
- You are blocking the queue.
Are you going to board the flight?

1835
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:57,217
Excuse me, sir. I'm talking to you.

1836
02:13:57,300 --> 02:13:58,175
I can hear you!

1837
02:13:58,967 --> 02:13:59,883
I'm not deaf!

1838
02:14:02,508 --> 02:14:03,342
Najma!

1839
02:14:04,050 --> 02:14:06,217
Where are you going? Listen to me.

1840
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:08,508
The passports and luggage are lying there.

1841
02:14:08,675 --> 02:14:11,050
Insia, explain to your mom.

1842
02:14:11,342 --> 02:14:12,675
It's all about the guitar, right?

1843
02:14:12,883 --> 02:14:14,383
We'll take the guitar along.

1844
02:14:14,467 --> 02:14:16,633
Listen, I'm ready to take the guitar.

1845
02:14:16,717 --> 02:14:19,592
Ma'am, once you step out,
you won't be allowed back in.

1846
02:14:20,717 --> 02:14:22,342
Nothing could be better than that.

1847
02:14:26,883 --> 02:14:28,175
Najma!

1848
02:14:29,050 --> 02:14:30,342
Listen to me!

1849
02:14:55,717 --> 02:14:56,758
But Mom...

1850
02:14:58,008 --> 02:14:59,258
What will we do now?

1851
02:15:00,092 --> 02:15:01,133
Where will we go?

1852
02:15:21,008 --> 02:15:23,592
Ma'am, may I use your cell phone
to make a call?

1853
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:26,008
It's urgent, please. Just one call.

1854
02:15:26,467 --> 02:15:27,342
Thank you so much.

1855
02:15:28,967 --> 02:15:29,800
Insu.

1856
02:15:30,258 --> 02:15:31,383
Call Shakti Kumaarr.

1857
02:15:32,383 --> 02:15:34,842
It's the night of the awards, right?
Let's just go there for now.

1858
02:15:36,092 --> 02:15:37,133
We'll figure the rest later.

1859
02:15:40,550 --> 02:15:41,508
When will they be here?

1860
02:15:41,758 --> 02:15:42,633
Any minute.

1861
02:15:49,467 --> 02:15:50,508
How are you?

1862
02:15:51,133 --> 02:15:53,300
Insia's mom, I'm very happy to meet you.

1863
02:15:53,883 --> 02:15:55,050
Fantastic!

1864
02:15:55,383 --> 02:15:56,425
Shakti's entry.

1865
02:15:58,008 --> 02:15:58,883
Hold it.

1866
02:15:59,092 --> 02:16:00,008
Where are your passes?

1867
02:16:01,467 --> 02:16:02,883
Don't you recognize her?

1868
02:16:03,758 --> 02:16:04,592
No.

1869
02:16:05,883 --> 02:16:06,758
Wait.

1870
02:16:08,258 --> 02:16:10,175
She's the YouTube singer.

1871
02:16:27,758 --> 02:16:30,217
- If you are done with your nonsense,
can we do some important work?

1872
02:16:30,467 --> 02:16:34,008
- Yes, of course. Let's get on
with what we've been paid for.

1873
02:17:09,300 --> 02:17:11,425
Monali Thakur.

1874
02:17:12,967 --> 02:17:13,842
What rubbish!

1875
02:17:15,508 --> 02:17:16,383
It's all rubbish.

1876
02:17:33,342 --> 02:17:34,717
Ever since I was a little girl

1877
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:37,383
and used to sing on stage,

1878
02:17:38,508 --> 02:17:39,633
I had just one dream.

1879
02:17:40,842 --> 02:17:42,300
To win these awards.

1880
02:17:43,967 --> 02:17:45,717
And every time I'm in the audience

1881
02:17:45,800 --> 02:17:47,633
and the nominations were announced,

1882
02:17:48,508 --> 02:17:52,217
I always wish that I win, not anyone else.

1883
02:17:53,842 --> 02:17:54,925
But, this time...

1884
02:17:57,050 --> 02:17:58,092
something didn't feel right.

1885
02:18:00,800 --> 02:18:01,717
Today,

1886
02:18:02,633 --> 02:18:03,758
amongst us,

1887
02:18:05,008 --> 02:18:06,467
there's a new star.

1888
02:18:08,717 --> 02:18:10,175
And compared to her voice,

1889
02:18:11,842 --> 02:18:13,925
my voice seems to pale.

1890
02:18:16,758 --> 02:18:17,925
Secret Superstar...

1891
02:18:19,300 --> 02:18:22,842
If you're here amongst us today,

1892
02:18:23,550 --> 02:18:25,925
please come up,

1893
02:18:26,217 --> 02:18:27,633
and collect your award.

1894
02:18:28,342 --> 02:18:29,217
Because I...

1895
02:18:30,883 --> 02:18:32,050
I can't accept this award.

1896
02:18:32,550 --> 02:18:33,425
Go on.

1897
02:18:35,550 --> 02:18:36,592
Go. They're calling you.

1898
02:18:37,133 --> 02:18:38,133
Insu, go.

1899
02:18:38,592 --> 02:18:41,508
Secret Superstar, are you here?

1900
02:18:41,842 --> 02:18:42,925
Is Secret Superstar there?

1901
02:18:43,508 --> 02:18:44,508
Secret Superstar...

1902
02:18:46,217 --> 02:18:47,217
Are you here?

1903
02:18:49,133 --> 02:18:50,425
The Secret Superstar is here.

1904
02:18:50,508 --> 02:18:51,508
Put a spotlight on her.

1905
02:18:51,592 --> 02:18:53,092
Give her a big hand.

1906
02:18:55,592 --> 02:18:56,842
Move the jib! Cameras on her!

1907
02:18:59,050 --> 02:19:00,717
Insu, go.
- Insu, go.

1908
02:19:00,800 --> 02:19:03,008
You should go.
- They're calling you. Go.

1909
02:19:03,342 --> 02:19:04,383
Go.

1910
02:19:04,967 --> 02:19:06,217
Claim your window seat.

1911
02:20:51,800 --> 02:20:54,508
You all think
that I'm the 'Secret Superstar'.

1912
02:20:56,717 --> 02:20:57,675
But I'm not.

1913
02:21:01,342 --> 02:21:02,508
I was six years old

1914
02:21:04,300 --> 02:21:05,758
when mom got me a guitar.

1915
02:21:07,675 --> 02:21:08,592
How?

1916
02:21:10,633 --> 02:21:12,508
She stole money from my dad's wallet.

1917
02:21:14,592 --> 02:21:15,883
She had a necklace.

1918
02:21:16,592 --> 02:21:17,508
Her last ornament.

1919
02:21:19,633 --> 02:21:22,508
She sold that and bought me a laptop.

1920
02:21:26,508 --> 02:21:30,508
Dad wanted to end my story
when I was in my mom's womb.

1921
02:21:33,633 --> 02:21:35,050
But she didn't let it happen.

1922
02:21:37,717 --> 02:21:39,717
My mom has written my story.

1923
02:21:41,800 --> 02:21:42,925
And she continues to write it.

1924
02:21:46,133 --> 02:21:50,217
Singing songs and winning awards,
have always been my dream.

1925
02:21:52,675 --> 02:21:55,175
But some people aren't allowed to dream.

1926
02:21:58,217 --> 02:21:59,633
The freedom to dream...

1927
02:22:01,550 --> 02:22:03,092
Well, my mom gave me that, too.

1928
02:22:08,300 --> 02:22:10,175
So, who's the superstar here?

1929
02:22:11,467 --> 02:22:12,342
Me?

1930
02:22:13,550 --> 02:22:14,467
Or my mom?

1931
02:22:17,967 --> 02:22:18,883
Mom...

1932
02:22:20,508 --> 02:22:21,675
You are not stupid.

1933
02:22:23,633 --> 02:22:24,758
You're a genius.

1934
02:22:27,300 --> 02:22:28,425
You are not a coward.

1935
02:22:30,217 --> 02:22:31,300
You're a fighter.

1936
02:22:36,883 --> 02:22:38,675
You aren't childish at all, Mom.

1937
02:22:43,425 --> 02:22:45,133
You are the world's best mom.

1938
02:23:18,758 --> 02:23:25,133
<i>She's my dearestMy mom</i>

1939
02:23:26,842 --> 02:23:32,842
<i>She's my dearestMy mom</i>

1940
02:23:34,800 --> 02:23:41,717
<i>She's my dearestMy mom</i>

1941
02:23:42,675 --> 02:23:49,675
<i>She's my dearestMy mom</i>

1942
02:24:49,967 --> 02:24:53,425
Friends, this is Shakti Kumaarr's
first YouTube video.

1943
02:24:54,258 --> 02:24:57,550
And I dedicate it to the Secret Superstar,

1944
02:24:58,258 --> 02:24:59,342
whom I launched!

1945
02:25:01,175 --> 02:25:02,592
So, presenting my new song,

1946
02:25:02,967 --> 02:25:04,967
fresh off the block,
recorded just yesterday.

1947
02:25:36,508 --> 02:25:38,842
<i>I'll speak your words</i>

1948
02:25:38,925 --> 02:25:40,675
<i>I'll sing your praises</i>

1949
02:25:40,758 --> 02:25:44,217
<i>I'll adorn myself
With the colors of your love</i>

1950
02:25:51,717 --> 02:25:53,300
<i>I'll dance like you</i>

1951
02:25:53,383 --> 02:25:55,092
<i>I'll sway like you</i>

1952
02:25:55,175 --> 02:25:58,592
<i>I'll adorn myself
With the jewels of your love</i>

1953
02:26:06,425 --> 02:26:09,633
<i>I dance wild and free</i>

1954
02:26:10,050 --> 02:26:15,092
<i>I dance wild and free
For you, my sexy lover</i>

1955
02:26:16,217 --> 02:26:19,550

<i>Everybody in the house</i>

1961
02:26:56,467 --> 02:27:00,425
<i>Very hot, whiskey shot
Got me high without a sip</i>

1962
02:27:00,550 --> 02:27:04,342
<i>I'm doomed now
Left to lay in the fields</i>

1963
02:27:07,508 --> 02:27:11,258
<i>I've got cash, you have beautiful lips
Let's meet and party hard</i>

1964
02:27:11,467 --> 02:27:14,842
<i>Chicken roast, manchurian
I'll have a go at them both</i>

1965

My sexy lover</i>
