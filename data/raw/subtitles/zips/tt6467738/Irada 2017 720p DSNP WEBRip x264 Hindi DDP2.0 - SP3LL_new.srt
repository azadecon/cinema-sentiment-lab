00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,555
<i>Those who watch while others burn...</i>

2
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:46,862
<i>Your straw houses will soon be graves...</i>

3
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:50,691
<i>When winds stoke the flames of death,</i> . ..

4
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:53,405
<i>How long will you be saved?</i>

5
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:11,156
Come on, come on!

6
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:27,246
Yeah, that's it... smooth strokes,
smooth strokes...

7
00:04:31,868 --> 00:04:34,904
Okay, five more, five more...

8
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:39,699
Rhythmic breathing,
rhythmic breathing...

9
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:42,534
...Stronger, stronger, stronger!

10
00:04:50,828 --> 00:04:52,080
Any letters?

11
00:04:53,286 --> 00:04:56,899
Papa, looks like there's good news!

12
00:04:57,754 --> 00:05:01,302
You need to follow the commander's
orders before you take flight...

13
00:05:01,362 --> 00:05:03,375
...Miss Fighter Pilot!

14
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:04,272
Papa!

15
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,451
Shut the box.

16
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:07,275
I've shut it... Papa please
let me check it once!

17
00:05:07,363 --> 00:05:08,745
And close the gate!

18
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:15,789
Papa please!

19
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,785
Miss Fighter Pilot!
You can't disobey orders like that.

20
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:22,851
Okay, read it out.

21
00:05:27,854 --> 00:05:28,757
What happened?

22
00:05:30,376 --> 00:05:31,432
Don't tell me...

23
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:40,185
Rejected on basis of endurance
and physical fitness.

24
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:06,708
200 meters in 2 minutes...

25
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:13,126
500 meters in two minutes...

26
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:18,357
lam not numbers!

27
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,932
lam not numbers!

28
00:07:29,276 --> 00:07:34,805
Come on faster,
faster, ls that fastest you can go?

29
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:36,015
Come on!

30
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:41,442
Bloody hell! Rhythmic
breathing... Rhythmic breathing!

31
00:07:42,522 --> 00:07:47,126
Shit! Back, back, five more!

32
00:07:50,183 --> 00:07:54,079
Smooth strokes, smooth strokes,
how many times I have to tell you...

33
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,385
You're supposed to swim,
not wade!

34
00:07:55,386 --> 00:07:56,027
Back...

35
00:07:56,854 --> 00:07:59,226
Go. Come on stronger!

36
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:07,325
Come on... one more time back...

37
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:12,819
Riya, Riyal

38
00:08:15,718 --> 00:08:17,154
Riyal

39
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:28,908
She swims for a good
45 minutes everyday, Doctor.

40
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:30,881
Non-stop. Every single day.

41
00:08:31,422 --> 00:08:34,361
Today we did an hour,
but I know her strength!

42
00:08:34,422 --> 00:08:37,807
Relax, I think this is something else.

43
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:39,891
I need to examine her further.

44
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:48,900
So...

45
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,489
...where were we?

46
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,694
You save your queen.

47
00:09:56,711 --> 00:10:00,031
You see, it starts in the lungs, and
then starts spreading all over the body.

48
00:10:01,371 --> 00:10:02,808
It's a galloping Cancer.

49
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:17,397
What stage?

50
00:10:20,044 --> 00:10:21,513
It's a pretty advanced stage.

51
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,021
L-low long will she...

52
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:28,826
I can't be sure.

53
00:10:29,524 --> 00:10:30,645
Maybe a month.

54
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:41,178
Chemo?

55
00:10:41,366 --> 00:10:45,459
You can try your luck,
but it's like killing a fly with a sword.

56
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:33,660
Riya...

57
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:36,973
...what have you done, my love!

58
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:39,972
What have you done?

59
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:43,322
Riya?

60
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:47,092
I read the report.

61
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,555
So what? Listen to me.

62
00:11:57,493 --> 00:12:00,432
There are no targets in life.

63
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:03,249
The real battle is here...

64
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:06,466
...you can't lose it.

65
00:12:08,218 --> 00:12:09,916
You can't give up.

66
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:14,353
From tomorrow, no targets or agendas.

67
00:12:16,358 --> 00:12:17,892
Tomorrow is another day.

68
00:12:20,635 --> 00:12:22,529
From now on, there's no agenda.

69
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:23,890
No training.

70
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:26,325
None of this.

71
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,350
Q Kay-

72
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:32,996
<i>Okay. . ...</i>

73
00:12:34,424 --> 00:12:36,949
Then let's kill the
fly with the sword tomorrow.

74
00:14:33,738 --> 00:14:35,632
Hey, stop!

75
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:00,806
Wanna hear a story?

76
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:06,174
In high school, I had a classmate
who didn't like the way I talked.

77
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:09,371
During our farewell party...

78
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:11,826
...| took him to the pool
and dunked him into the water...

79
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:13,802
...till he was scared shitless.

80
00:15:14,723 --> 00:15:16,737
That's how I've achieved everything.

81
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:18,395
If you come in my way,
you go down under.

82
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,935
I know everything.

83
00:15:20,915 --> 00:15:24,082
Blood group scam, reverse boring.

84
00:15:24,554 --> 00:15:25,991
I know all about it.

85
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:29,252
What are you trying to
prove by being James Bond, eh?

86
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,740
That the blood reports
show traces of Uranium?

87
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,886
No one knows jackshit about
Reverse boring in this town.

88
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:39,406
Ammonium Nitrate
and Chromium are toxic...

89
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,810
...no one cares about all this.

90
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:45,149
Everyone's on their own trip here.

91
00:15:45,588 --> 00:15:47,602
Taking their wives
out on romantic dinners...

92
00:15:48,206 --> 00:15:50,349
...or taking their girlfriends
out for disco Bollywood nights...

93
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,072
...that is life for them.

94
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:56,251
The truth is that people here are
now used to drinking this poison...

95
00:15:56,313 --> 00:15:58,109
...and that's good for my business.

96
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,180
And now you know it.

97
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:04,582
You think you can bury the truth?

98
00:16:04,868 --> 00:16:07,459
Someone's going to expose you soon!

99
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:09,371
It doesn't end here!

100
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,447
You can't stop this!

101
00:16:15,306 --> 00:16:17,799
You can't stop this!

102
00:16:41,192 --> 00:16:41,965
Praise the Lord!

103
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:42,664
Praise the Lord!

104
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:44,161
The funds have already arrived.

105
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,798
You're never late, I must say!

106
00:16:45,853 --> 00:16:48,476
Well, I aim to please!

107
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:49,907
Keep this.

108
00:16:50,257 --> 00:16:53,457
And give this to that
gentleman there, will you?

109
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,634
Tell him it's from me.

110
00:16:57,502 --> 00:16:59,995
It's a dirty joke.

111
00:17:00,982 --> 00:17:03,985
Sir, that gentlemen sent this for you.

112
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:15,961
<i>On the path to conquer the throne,
Some of your pawns must die...</i>

113
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:19,817
<i>If your eyes aim the big kill,
you must learn to eat humble pie.</i>

114
00:17:19,878 --> 00:17:23,393
Ah, what poetry!
Who is this, Gha|ib's Uncle?

115
00:17:23,612 --> 00:17:24,766
He's a motivational speaker.

116
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:27,161
Looking for funds for his new book.

117
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:30,006
Don't look back or
he'll latch on to you.

118
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,050
And bug you with his letters.

119
00:17:31,273 --> 00:17:35,550
Ladies and Gentlemen, I would
now like to call upon the Honorable...

120
00:17:35,614 --> 00:17:40,850
Chief Minister of state Ms Braitch
to felicitate Mr Paddy. FSharma,

121
00:17:40,913 --> 00:17:44,331
...the managing director
of PPFPL for his decade...

122
00:17:44,392 --> 00:17:47,266
...long commitment to
sustainable business practices.

123
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:52,662
Ladies and Gentlemen, the Global
Ten Award goes to Mr Paddy I: Sharma.

124
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,637
Are your legs glued? Get the trophy!

125
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:00,553
Wonderful, isn't it- Getting
this from your lucky charm, eh!

126
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:01,957
Thank you.

127
00:18:06,703 --> 00:18:08,140
Thank you everyone.

128
00:18:10,694 --> 00:18:11,815
Bloody criminal!

129
00:18:11,938 --> 00:18:13,407
Sustainable award, huh?

130
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:16,290
Receiving fancy awards while
you get Anirudh Dutt abducted?

131
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:20,143
He had all the evidence against you,
that's why you kidnapped him right?

132
00:18:20,174 --> 00:18:21,164
Everyone knows what dirty games...

133
00:18:21,227 --> 00:18:22,990
...you've been playing
behind this glitzy fagade.

134
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:26,150
I will expose you!
I will expose all of you!

135
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:28,513
Leave me. Leave me!

136
00:18:36,388 --> 00:18:39,458
Fools rush in where
angels fear to tread.

137
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:43,610
Shakespeare said it eons ago,
but the curtains are rising now.

138
00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:47,539
Being the poster boy of Forbes,
or dabbling in number games...

139
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:49,162
...| don't understand this.

140
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,663
I understand only golf and jazz.

141
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:58,128
So let the jazz begin!
And enjoy the evening.

142
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:04,872
Move it! Move back please!

143
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:07,039
We will answer all your
queries but for now move back

144
00:19:09,585 --> 00:19:11,218
l-low did you do it'?

145
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:15,818
At the Doon School Farewell party,

146
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,625
you pushed Dukki into
the pool, around 7 pm.

147
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:22,392
Did you save him or did he drown?

148
00:19:28,322 --> 00:19:30,052
There's muck on your collar.

149
00:19:30,108 --> 00:19:31,099
Start the car.

150
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,565
Open the door!

151
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,942
You slung mud at him, right?

152
00:20:08,189 --> 00:20:09,146
Anirudh's bitch!

153
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,267
Your pretty face
will burn in acid now.

154
00:20:10,327 --> 00:20:12,122
You have been playing
sting journalist for too long.

155
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,225
Tonight, you'll be on breaking news!

156
00:20:19,744 --> 00:20:21,790
This isn't a city of big movie heroes.

157
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,678
It's a city buried in ashes.

158
00:20:24,244 --> 00:20:26,616
Anyone can go missing here, anytime.

159
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,479
Everyone wants to fight
their battles with us.

160
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:33,253
Totally. File a missing complaint.

161
00:20:33,437 --> 00:20:35,614
After all, the law reigns supreme.

162
00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:40,875
Right. But you guys run a
parallel system at PPFPL, don't you?

163
00:20:40,938 --> 00:20:42,799
You get Anirudh out of this!

164
00:20:43,236 --> 00:20:44,259
You know I won't stop at this.

165
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:46,912
Oh madam,
don't try and act smart, okay?

166
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,658
People literally shit
bricks in front of us.

167
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:50,965
They shiver, stutter
and break into a cold sweat.

168
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:57,447
So spare your shenanigans for your
fancy tea parties! Not here, got it!

169
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,808
<i>In a moment you became a stranger</i>

170
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,388
<i>Didn't even stop to look back...</i>

171
00:21:12,602 --> 00:21:16,727
<i>Consumed in your love</i>

172
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:21,420
<i>I wait in hope...</i>

173
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,550
Oh <i>my</i> love...

174
00:21:23,902 --> 00:21:27,221
<i>My</i> sweet beloved

175
00:21:27,668 --> 00:21:28,821
Oh <i>my</i> love...

176
00:21:28,881 --> 00:21:31,439
<i>My</i> sweet beloved

177
00:21:31,562 --> 00:21:34,566
<i>There's no one like you...</i>

178
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:39,644
<i>Soaked in a stream of your memories...</i>

179
00:21:40,308 --> 00:21:44,171
<i>Soaked in a stream of your memories...</i>

180
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:47,140
<i>I cried the whole night...</i>

181
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:49,158
<i>Oh my beloved...</i>

182
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,029
<i>My sweet beloved. ....</i>

183
00:21:52,181 --> 00:21:56,371
<i>There is no one like you</i>

184
00:22:01,374 --> 00:22:06,457
<i>Bereft of your love</i>

185
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:11,312
<i>I am swirling in the delirium of oneness</i>

186
00:22:11,812 --> 00:22:16,633
<i>They say Pm so consumed by you</i>

187
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,459
<i>That I've lost sense of day and night</i>

188
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:27,454
<i>It's this distance
of Jove that I can't bear</i>

189
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:28,931
<i>I pine for you as you have</i>

190
00:22:28,984 --> 00:22:31,096
<i>Stolen my nights</i> away

191
00:22:32,368 --> 00:22:34,098
Smile... Smile...

192
00:22:34,156 --> 00:22:35,091
Smile... Smile...

193
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,007
Smile... Smile!

194
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:40,573
I have a surprise for you!

195
00:22:40,731 --> 00:22:42,015
Let me show you.

196
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:47,181
and here it is kept...

197
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:58,775
<i>Oh my beloved...</i>

198
00:22:59,149 --> 00:23:01,576
Come back to me...

199
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,544
<i>MY love!</i>

200
00:23:04,606 --> 00:23:07,393
Come back to me...

201
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:10,103
<i>As the world ceases to exist</i>

202
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,533
<i>Let's</i> rejoice <i>in</i> our togetherness

203
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:14,501
Come <i>my</i> beloved

204
00:23:14,757 --> 00:23:16,934
Come <i>my</i> beloved

205
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:30,337
Come back, <i>my</i> sweet love...

206
00:24:15,244 --> 00:24:17,193
Check, has the motor started?

207
00:24:17,446 --> 00:24:19,144
It's started!

208
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:21,984
The waste line is on.

209
00:24:22,298 --> 00:24:23,996
Pump the chemical
waste into the ground.

210
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,667
Dispose off the waste into the canal.

211
00:24:30,852 --> 00:24:32,419
And the remaining chemical waste,
dump it into the fields.

212
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,802
Security, what's that machine flying up there?

213
00:25:03,027 --> 00:25:04,442
Stop!

214
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,000
Stop!

215
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:35,559
Age?

216
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:37,056
26 years.

217
00:25:37,372 --> 00:25:37,916
Name?

218
00:25:37,978 --> 00:25:39,361
<i>Arﬂrudh Du“.</i>

219
00:25:39,415 --> 00:25:40,439
Any wounds?

220
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,231
5 wounds on the Body
and on the head as well.

221
00:25:42,288 --> 00:25:44,682
Those are just scratches, not wounds.
Count the fingers.

222
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:46,567
All intact.

223
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:47,818
Ears?

224
00:25:47,874 --> 00:25:49,027
Intact, sire.

225
00:25:49,885 --> 00:25:52,224
Here, put a stamp on
this and a sheet on him.

226
00:25:52,693 --> 00:25:53,978
Hey, come here fast with the sheets!

227
00:25:54,098 --> 00:25:55,088
Come on, quick!

228
00:25:58,439 --> 00:25:59,973
Cover the body properly.

229
00:26:11,877 --> 00:26:12,236
Hello

230
00:26:12,292 --> 00:26:14,273
Wow, buddy- what a player you are!

231
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:16,865
The girl slings mud on your face...

232
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:19,032
...and you send her boyfriend
straight to heaven! Clean bowled!

233
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:20,593
I'll call you after my meeting.

234
00:26:20,654 --> 00:26:21,612
Cool.

235
00:26:26,113 --> 00:26:27,201
Close your mouth!

236
00:26:28,315 --> 00:26:29,882
Stop eating noisily.

237
00:26:30,837 --> 00:26:32,535
You were born with a set of ten teeth.

238
00:26:33,965 --> 00:26:36,685
Everyone would tell me,
you've given birth to a witch!

239
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,874
And I would say, how can it be'?
She's my flesh and blood!

240
00:26:40,605 --> 00:26:42,748
Bu you actually turned
out to be a monster!

241
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:47,052
Ate your father whole!
And it still didn't satiate your hunger?

242
00:26:48,201 --> 00:26:52,261
Why did you do it,
why did you kill him!

243
00:26:52,574 --> 00:26:54,946
And now you want to kill me too?

244
00:27:17,216 --> 00:27:18,272
That's the body.

245
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:04,215
Happy Birthday, Riya.

246
00:29:09,987 --> 00:29:11,718
Excuse me, can I have a light?

247
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,637
Thank you!

248
00:29:23,393 --> 00:29:25,059
It's no coincidence
that you're here, is it?

249
00:29:25,116 --> 00:29:27,456
Absolutely not.
It's a well thought out plan.

250
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,241
L-low do you know about
the Doon school incident'?

251
00:29:29,841 --> 00:29:35,751
Dukki- your childhood buddy
is now a farmer in Bihar.

252
00:29:37,437 --> 00:29:40,256
Your daughter Ivlitali. ..

253
00:29:41,203 --> 00:29:43,119
...EDM is her national anthem.

254
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,427
Who the hell are you?

255
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:45,609
I'm a writer.

256
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,370
I believe in one shot.

257
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:51,235
Would you like a cigar?

258
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:52,192
No thanks.

259
00:29:53,652 --> 00:29:56,819
This is my book, check it out.

260
00:29:57,164 --> 00:30:00,483
If you approve,
you could fund the launch.

261
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:01,449
Why?

262
00:30:02,877 --> 00:30:06,708
Those who live on ocean shores,
should beware of tidal waves.

263
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,510
Have a look.

264
00:30:10,952 --> 00:30:12,814
You fund so many causes.

265
00:30:14,304 --> 00:30:17,210
You spent 5000 crores
on the Life fountain Lab!

266
00:30:19,156 --> 00:30:20,821
This is a pittance in comparison.

267
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:27,748
You opened 2 pro><y accounts
for the Life fountain lab, didn't you?

268
00:30:29,242 --> 00:30:30,679
Used Jeetu for it...

269
00:30:34,221 --> 00:30:35,375
Another request.

270
00:30:36,776 --> 00:30:39,595
You must launch the
book with your own hands.

271
00:30:43,415 --> 00:30:45,363
The media is hungry for a scoop.

272
00:30:57,427 --> 00:30:59,028
Ladies and Gentlemen:

273
00:30:59,087 --> 00:31:02,537
I call upon Parabjeet Walia to
introduce his book, One Shot!

274
00:31:05,088 --> 00:31:07,646
Thank you, thank you very much.

275
00:31:09,876 --> 00:31:14,545
They say there can
be only one Lion in a forest...

276
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:18,497
...and only one leader among men.

277
00:31:20,951 --> 00:31:23,803
The rest merely exist...

278
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:29,003
That's why it's important to grab
the first opportunity and get ahead.

279
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,529
Life doesn't give you many chances.

280
00:31:35,092 --> 00:31:38,510
It's all about one shot.

281
00:31:43,327 --> 00:31:46,146
<i>Mere rabbis-rousing is not my aim...</i>

282
00:31:48,434 --> 00:31:52,462
<i>The who/e effort is
to make the wheels turn...</i>

283
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:57,603
<i>Yes, the walls have begun
to tremble like curtains...</i>

284
00:31:58,137 --> 00:32:01,141
<i>But the point is that the foundations
must shake and churn...</i>

285
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,215
<i>If not in my heart,
your heart shall behold...</i>

286
00:32:06,755 --> 00:32:11,164
<i>Wherever the ﬁre be,
but for sure it must burn.</i>

287
00:32:25,556 --> 00:32:27,950
2 blasts took place
at the PPFPL factory.

288
00:32:28,078 --> 00:32:30,537
The first explosion was minor,
which set off the alarms.

289
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:31,688
The factory was then evacuated.

290
00:32:31,748 --> 00:32:33,098
The second explosion was humongous,

291
00:32:33,121 --> 00:32:34,721
Considering the intensity of the blast.

292
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:37,208
The fact that there were
zero casualties draws suspicion.

293
00:32:37,271 --> 00:32:39,415
ls the state witnessing
terrorism again?

294
00:32:39,537 --> 00:32:41,779
So far, no RDX has been found.

295
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:43,692
But why was the factory evacuated?

296
00:32:44,134 --> 00:32:46,028
We are surrounded
by so many questions...

297
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,290
...and the nation
wants to know the answer!

298
00:32:48,411 --> 00:32:51,230
Ma'am, do you think this was a terrorist
attack? ls there a foreign hand?

299
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:54,135
No need for all this commotion.

300
00:32:54,188 --> 00:32:57,061
Whatever happened is terrible,
we strongly condemn it.

301
00:32:57,092 --> 00:32:58,790
Investigations are on...

302
00:32:58,848 --> 00:32:59,806
...but at this point we
have no verified information...

303
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:01,600
...on the involvement
of any terrorist groups.

304
00:33:01,817 --> 00:33:03,798
But I'll make you a promise...

305
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:07,089
...whoever the culprits are,
we'll nab them before Diwali.

306
00:33:07,147 --> 00:33:07,855
Mefam!

307
00:33:07,913 --> 00:33:09,448
Mefam!

308
00:33:38,971 --> 00:33:40,027
Wait outside.

309
00:33:40,343 --> 00:33:42,258
3O missed calls!
I have other stuff to attend to...

310
00:33:42,322 --> 00:33:44,271
Whoever did this,
had it all planned well in advance.

311
00:33:45,163 --> 00:33:46,698
I'll chase him down right
to where he lives and murder him!

312
00:33:48,163 --> 00:33:49,448
I'm not gonna leave him!

313
00:33:50,078 --> 00:33:51,167
Relax, mister.

314
00:33:51,578 --> 00:33:54,038
I want all my insurance
money in one week flat.

315
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:58,196
My company is worth 6000 crores.
I want more than that! Got it'?

316
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:00,453
Look, it's all gonna get sorted.

317
00:34:00,516 --> 00:34:03,586
Since it's a blast, it will
be assumed to be a terrorist attack.

318
00:34:03,676 --> 00:34:04,829
The case is bound to
go to the central government.

319
00:34:04,889 --> 00:34:06,935
I'm not interested in any
of your bureaucratic nonsense.

320
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,133
I want my money. When and hovv will
you get it back, is what I wanna know!

321
00:34:10,316 --> 00:34:12,177
All these platitudes of yours,
keep them for the press.

322
00:34:13,922 --> 00:34:16,513
Okay, calm down.

323
00:34:18,678 --> 00:34:20,279
Come, sit- let's talk.

324
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:21,557
Tell me.

325
00:34:23,115 --> 00:34:24,498
Have you heard you
the story about the horses?

326
00:34:25,604 --> 00:34:27,367
Just hear me out.

327
00:34:28,765 --> 00:34:31,671
Not all horses are the same,
there are race-horses...

328
00:34:31,733 --> 00:34:33,268
...and there are those
used at marriage processions.

329
00:34:34,382 --> 00:34:36,842
And then there is the
horse of the government...

330
00:34:36,904 --> 00:34:39,363
...which we will now
ride like the groom's horse...

331
00:34:40,607 --> 00:34:42,882
...the louder the wind pipes
will blow, the faster it will trot.

332
00:34:44,022 --> 00:34:46,743
We have this officer, Arjun Ivlishra.

333
00:34:47,373 --> 00:34:50,476
All we need to do is close the files.
It's an open the shut case.

334
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:53,412
You'll get your money,
no need to stress.

335
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:01,967
Ride any horse you please...

336
00:35:02,025 --> 00:35:03,690
...but if this isn't fixed,
the next election...

337
00:35:03,748 --> 00:35:05,761
...poster will show a different face

338
00:35:06,557 --> 00:35:08,473
...and the money will
go to someone e|se's account.

339
00:35:08,887 --> 00:35:10,302
Got it?

340
00:35:12,463 --> 00:35:14,378
Don't get so hyper, sir.

341
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:17,959
Chill out... Trust me,
we'll sort everything.

342
00:35:38,572 --> 00:35:40,999
Why you all are wearing dirty uniforms?
All the donations I give- are they useless?

343
00:35:41,062 --> 00:35:42,857
Go, tell your principal, okay?

344
00:35:42,881 --> 00:35:44,448
Send me a cup of tea.

345
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:47,227
Update all of them, okay?

346
00:35:56,511 --> 00:35:59,167
Come on in! l-low can I serve you'?

347
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,764
Tea or coffee?

348
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:02,673
No, thank you.

349
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:06,985
Ivlanipur, Kargil, Anantnag, eh?

350
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,733
Been through pretty rough waters.

351
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,811
Now you want to relax in
air-conditioned offices, don't you'?

352
00:36:11,864 --> 00:36:12,920
The Prime Minister's office.

353
00:36:13,013 --> 00:36:14,450
Just doing my bit for the family...

354
00:36:14,513 --> 00:36:17,517
Of the family,
for the family, by the family.

355
00:36:18,216 --> 00:36:19,783
That's what democracy is really about.

356
00:36:20,067 --> 00:36:21,286
Surely you know how it is'?

357
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,463
You're absolutely correct, ma'am.

358
00:36:22,525 --> 00:36:26,933
Shut the case, chill and have
a blast this Diwali with your family.

359
00:36:26,994 --> 00:36:29,813
Yes. The case will be shut in a week.

360
00:36:29,867 --> 00:36:30,640
Perfect.

361
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:32,645
There's just some
problem with evidence...

362
00:36:32,675 --> 00:36:33,960
...but I'm gathering
all the information...

363
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,336
You have information;
give it to the broadcasting ministry.

364
00:36:38,899 --> 00:36:40,761
Let's cut to the chase.

365
00:36:41,262 --> 00:36:43,341
It's an open and shut case.

366
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,235
Just wrap it up and get rid of it,
without a sound.

367
00:36:47,837 --> 00:36:48,893
Yes ma'am.

368
00:36:49,114 --> 00:36:50,203
Good bye.

369
00:36:51,029 --> 00:36:52,085
Good bye.

370
00:36:56,072 --> 00:36:58,119
They have hoarded tons of
money and filled their coffers.

371
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,905
And they can't even
keep a chair inside?

372
00:37:00,765 --> 00:37:01,668
So, what's the price

373
00:37:01,754 --> 00:37:03,256
IPS officers are commanding in
the marriage market nowadays?

374
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:04,854
<i>2 Groves.</i>

375
00:37:05,201 --> 00:37:07,509
Nice, then you've hit the jackpot!

376
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,445
No sir. I don't think like that.

377
00:37:11,043 --> 00:37:13,186
I will marry the girl I like, not
the one who brings the heftiest dowry.

378
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,963
Actually we need that
change in the country...

379
00:37:16,053 --> 00:37:17,751
And we will bring that change.

380
00:37:18,128 --> 00:37:21,741
Speaking of change...
Do you have change of 500 rupees?

381
00:37:22,629 --> 00:37:23,304
Yes Sir.

382
00:37:23,363 --> 00:37:27,836
Do me a favour, take these 500
rupees and get me a cigarette pack.

383
00:37:28,087 --> 00:37:30,035
Lets blow away your 'change' in smoke!

384
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:38,242
Change...

385
00:37:38,876 --> 00:37:41,978
As long as the entire system
doesn't change, no one will change.

386
00:37:42,834 --> 00:37:44,880
They are all Scoundrels.

387
00:37:46,505 --> 00:37:47,278
Here, sir.

388
00:37:55,953 --> 00:37:57,107
See, there's your change.

389
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:06,399
I-Ii. I am Maya. I am a journalist
and I have some classified info...

390
00:38:07,922 --> 00:38:08,946
Hi. I am Maya.

391
00:38:09,008 --> 00:38:10,609
I am a journalist and I have some...

392
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:12,845
...classified information
that I would like to...

393
00:38:13,381 --> 00:38:15,362
No, no, no...

394
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,908
Hi. I'm Maya. lam ajournalist
and I have some classified...

395
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,144
...information that
I would like to share with you.

396
00:38:24,521 --> 00:38:27,427
I'm sorry I've arrived
at your home unannounced...

397
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:29,699
...but this will be useful to you.

398
00:38:32,692 --> 00:38:35,087
Maya! Such a nice name, Maya.

399
00:38:36,171 --> 00:38:38,598
Sorry, I shouldn't have
come here unannounced but..

400
00:38:38,852 --> 00:38:40,866
Hmm... Even I wasn't supposed
to be here, but here I am.

401
00:38:41,725 --> 00:38:42,051
Q Kay-

402
00:38:42,108 --> 00:38:44,982
I have this research and
lam sure it will be helpful to you.

403
00:38:46,161 --> 00:38:47,119
Not here...please keep it there

404
00:38:47,183 --> 00:38:48,750
There, right there.

405
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:50,697
Thank you.

406
00:38:53,855 --> 00:38:55,683
These white collar companies...

407
00:38:55,737 --> 00:38:57,751
While you're at it,
just keep this bottle there as well?

408
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,278
On the right corner. Thank you.

409
00:39:04,994 --> 00:39:06,409
All the muck lurking
behind the facade of these...

410
00:39:06,654 --> 00:39:08,255
...white collar companies,
it's all here for you to see.

411
00:39:08,314 --> 00:39:10,621
And that is PPFPL.

412
00:39:11,505 --> 00:39:14,738
L-low long have you been here Maya'?

413
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,624
Long enough to know that all
the high-rises in this city

414
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:20,516
Have their foundations
deep below in hell.

415
00:39:20,571 --> 00:39:23,423
Oh. No, I just wanted
to know where do you get...

416
00:39:23,475 --> 00:39:25,173
...the yummiest Chickpea
gravy and bread in town?

417
00:39:26,253 --> 00:39:27,309
You know the kind that...

418
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:32,670
Please go through that research.

419
00:39:33,562 --> 00:39:34,944
Yeah I will. I will.

420
00:39:35,382 --> 00:39:36,317
Thank you.

421
00:39:38,828 --> 00:39:42,986
Excuse me! Dolphin Chowk has the best
Chickpea gravy and bread in town...

422
00:39:43,202 --> 00:39:44,421
...Just let Sir know.

423
00:39:44,478 --> 00:39:45,251
Yes ma'am.

424
00:39:46,393 --> 00:39:47,808
L-low are you, buddy'?

425
00:39:47,862 --> 00:39:50,005
I'm okay, you tell me?

426
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:51,702
Same here, life's chugging along.

427
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:53,584
Are you surely coming
home this Diwali?

428
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:54,857
Or do I have to cajole
mom to buy me crackers?

429
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:56,353
I will be there for sure.

430
00:39:56,735 --> 00:40:02,809
Rocket, Anar, Chakri, Deepika bomb,
Katrina bomb, Priyanka bomb...

431
00:40:02,832 --> 00:40:04,726
Ask your mom to sanction
the budget for all of them.

432
00:40:04,971 --> 00:40:07,464
We will burst them together. Okay?

433
00:40:07,524 --> 00:40:10,343
Do call mom once in a while.

434
00:40:10,365 --> 00:40:12,063
She is a nuclear bomb!

435
00:40:15,536 --> 00:40:17,963
Sir, our industry has a fool-proof
trip system for safety.

436
00:40:18,026 --> 00:40:19,560
A safety team came
from Germany to check.

437
00:40:19,941 --> 00:40:22,183
The reactor has been under surveillance

438
00:40:23,676 --> 00:40:24,764
What's your role here, sir?

439
00:40:25,176 --> 00:40:26,427
Sir I am the Main wire here.

440
00:40:27,122 --> 00:40:27,960
You mean chief?

441
00:40:28,144 --> 00:40:31,214
No sir, main wire. lam the only
source and link to the head command!

442
00:40:31,272 --> 00:40:35,267
L-laha. So how old is the plant'?

443
00:40:35,325 --> 00:40:36,163
1 O years

444
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:37,211
And how long have you been here'?

445
00:40:37,241 --> 00:40:37,948
1 O years

446
00:40:38,007 --> 00:40:40,727
Any major accidents in the past?
Fire outbreak etc?

447
00:40:40,784 --> 00:40:41,589
Nothing sir.

448
00:40:41,646 --> 00:40:42,419
Fire safety?

449
00:40:42,475 --> 00:40:43,858
Sir the whole plant has a definite,
fixed fire...

450
00:40:43,912 --> 00:40:45,806
...installation system,
with fire water pumps.

451
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:49,468
but when the alarm went off, I don't
know why the safety system failed.

452
00:40:51,126 --> 00:40:53,237
Who was on duty at the time,
near the reactor?

453
00:40:53,297 --> 00:40:55,669
Bhagat Singh. Here sir,
this is the full employee list.

454
00:40:58,212 --> 00:40:59,202
Please call Bhagat Singh.

455
00:40:59,265 --> 00:41:04,054
Sir he is on leave for the last 5 days
due for his wife's cancer treatment.

456
00:41:06,352 --> 00:41:08,495
What are the chemicals
used in the reactor?

457
00:41:13,565 --> 00:41:15,394
It's highly confidential.

458
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:17,625
Only boss knows.

459
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,598
Just like Grand Ma's recipe, right?

460
00:41:20,013 --> 00:41:22,473
They will take the
secret to their graves.

461
00:41:22,598 --> 00:41:25,504
All American restaurants are just
like that! 'Secret recipe', they say.

462
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,189
Awful food but secret recipe!

463
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,773
Good. Nice meeting you.

464
00:41:31,695 --> 00:41:33,045
Secret recipe...

465
00:41:38,814 --> 00:41:40,380
Keep her under keen observation, okay?

466
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:42,843
Yes sir.
She's in my circle of suspicion.

467
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,696
Suspicion?

468
00:41:47,846 --> 00:41:49,446
This is a daily affair for them sir.

469
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:52,542
Ivlartyﬁs day was observed yesterday,
and they're still at it.

470
00:41:52,602 --> 00:41:53,408
Who is the new Martyr in town?

471
00:41:53,528 --> 00:41:56,663
Sir on 17th Nov 1928, when Lala Lajpat
Rai was murdered for protesting...

472
00:41:56,879 --> 00:41:59,949
...against Simon Commission,
Bhagat Singh took his revenge.

473
00:42:00,008 --> 00:42:03,077
Sir whenever I read about
Bhagat Singh, I get goosebumps.

474
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:07,485
For the deaf to hear,
blasts are needed... He was so right!

475
00:42:10,221 --> 00:42:12,464
For the deaf to hear,
blasts are needed.

476
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:16,040
Of course.

477
00:42:16,637 --> 00:42:20,349
Sir, but weren't we going
straight to the scene of crime?

478
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:21,753
Where are you going?

479
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:25,583
Sir, you came back?
Did you forget something?

480
00:42:25,831 --> 00:42:28,454
I didn't forget.
Just got reminded of something.

481
00:42:28,575 --> 00:42:30,556
As I keep remembering,
I will keep visiting you.

482
00:42:30,618 --> 00:42:31,554
Yes. Yes.

483
00:42:31,608 --> 00:42:33,306
L-low long have you known Bhagat Singh'?

484
00:42:33,587 --> 00:42:34,904
For the past 3 years.

485
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:37,774
Earlier he was employed in the packaging
unit, got promoted 5 days ago.

486
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:39,115
Who promoted him?

487
00:42:39,173 --> 00:42:39,652
I did.

488
00:42:39,906 --> 00:42:40,516
Why?

489
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,733
I savv his qualifications. He was a
gold medalist from Punjab University.

490
00:42:44,791 --> 00:42:45,694
One minute.

491
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:47,349
Please send Bhagat Singh's file.

492
00:42:48,206 --> 00:42:51,787
And he knew all about chemicals.
He'd been after me for a while...

493
00:42:51,845 --> 00:42:54,403
One minute.
Sir, here, this is his certificate.

494
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:58,391
He was an expert in his field,
so I promoted him.

495
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:00,214
Please check his bag.

496
00:43:00,271 --> 00:43:05,092
Bag? Why bag? Sir,
you are unnecessarily suspecting me.

497
00:43:05,314 --> 00:43:07,687
Sir, I'm a man of clean character.

498
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:09,624
Of course,
your character shines in your eyes.

499
00:43:09,784 --> 00:43:12,472
Been flying high, eh?
What is it, Meow-Meow?

500
00:43:13,103 --> 00:43:14,388
Looks like hash, from your fingers.

501
00:43:14,412 --> 00:43:15,533
Shoulcfve at least washed your hands!

502
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:17,286
Where you were you that day?

503
00:43:17,827 --> 00:43:20,134
This book, Sir. One Shot.

504
00:43:20,189 --> 00:43:22,431
I was at the launch
event with Paddy Sir.

505
00:43:22,487 --> 00:43:26,831
And I recorded a video as well.
Here, listen to the author's speech.

506
00:43:27,818 --> 00:43:29,712
<i>He fumed you, Mr Mukhytaar.</i>

507
00:43:30,148 --> 00:43:31,650
The certificate is fake.

508
00:43:35,957 --> 00:43:37,013
Keep this as evidence.

509
00:43:37,074 --> 00:43:39,316
Sir... Sir this is my phone.

510
00:43:39,373 --> 00:43:40,276
Evidence.

511
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:47,928
Where did the nail cutter go?

512
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:50,419
Check inside.

513
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,286
Yes Sir!

514
00:43:51,342 --> 00:43:52,724
Check all the rooms!

515
00:43:52,746 --> 00:43:54,574
Check that bedroom, anything there?

516
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:55,588
Open it, check properly!

517
00:43:55,652 --> 00:43:56,609
Did you find anything there

518
00:44:07,206 --> 00:44:08,457
Sir what did you just do?

519
00:44:09,345 --> 00:44:11,489
It's for protection from
bad cosmic events.

520
00:44:13,782 --> 00:44:14,717
Here, keep this.

521
00:44:15,952 --> 00:44:17,519
ls it evidence?

522
00:44:17,803 --> 00:44:19,817
No I like the fragrance.
I'm taking it home.

523
00:44:21,474 --> 00:44:22,497
Bow down to God.

524
00:44:43,338 --> 00:44:43,948
Keep this as well.

525
00:44:45,828 --> 00:44:47,243
You want to take this home as well?

526
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:49,310
This is evidence.

527
00:44:54,383 --> 00:44:55,155
Yes sir

528
00:44:55,691 --> 00:44:58,989
have marked some local phone numbers,
I want to trace their locations.

529
00:44:59,043 --> 00:45:01,666
Let me know when and where
these SIM Cards were used.

530
00:45:01,883 --> 00:45:02,624
Okay Sir!

531
00:45:05,363 --> 00:45:07,344
Didn't I ask you to give
me Bhagat Singh's bio-data?

532
00:45:07,373 --> 00:45:08,211
Yes sir.

533
00:45:11,204 --> 00:45:12,161
Thank you.

534
00:45:14,013 --> 00:45:17,431
Sir, we have traced the SIM,
Location says Nepal Patan.

535
00:45:17,493 --> 00:45:20,790
Inform Nepal authorities, this
man needs to be arrested on sight.

536
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:21,779
Okay Sir!

537
00:45:22,823 --> 00:45:24,586
Papa when are you coming back?

538
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:27,741
I defeated Som in a kabaddi match!

539
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,390
Saw the Spiderman movie too.

540
00:45:30,706 --> 00:45:34,255
Are you listening, Papa!
Mummy is getting thinner...

541
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:36,422
She doesn't eat properly,
I think she's dieting.

542
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,294
And do you know,
her hair is falling too.

543
00:45:39,484 --> 00:45:40,322
Are you there, Papa?
Can you hear me?

544
00:45:43,954 --> 00:45:47,698
ivlaa'm. The prime accused of the case
Bhagat Singh has committed suicide

545
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,442
So bring him back to life.

546
00:45:50,561 --> 00:45:52,455
Dig him out of his grave,
do whatever you must...

547
00:45:52,508 --> 00:45:55,196
But I want his
confession statement.

548
00:45:56,561 --> 00:45:57,138
lvlaa'm I feel...

549
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,944
Shove your feelings
up your backside, okay?

550
00:46:01,253 --> 00:46:03,049
This isn't a bloody
charity organisation!

551
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:07,543
Gurnaam, who will wash the glass?
Your Dad?

552
00:46:08,116 --> 00:46:12,905
You think the government gives
free meals? I'm gonna spank your ass!

553
00:46:12,968 --> 00:46:16,288
Do as I say, don't make me repeat myself!

554
00:46:17,181 --> 00:46:20,055
Yes, what was I saying...

555
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:23,184
I need the statement
before the press conference.

556
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,264
Got it?

557
00:46:25,768 --> 00:46:26,824
Yes

558
00:46:28,736 --> 00:46:31,424
<i>WHORE BITCH]</i>

559
00:46:32,726 --> 00:46:34,588
Why are you dragging PPFPL into this?

560
00:46:34,641 --> 00:46:38,386
Because they do ground water contamination
the region that we are in today...

561
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,584
ls now the cancer belt of our country.

562
00:46:40,738 --> 00:46:44,318
Reverse boring is a dangerous
way to dispose chemical waste.

563
00:46:44,377 --> 00:46:47,348
Factories like PPFPL don't
have waste treatment plants...

564
00:46:47,665 --> 00:46:51,594
...so they use this illegal but
convenient method of Reverse Boring.

565
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:56,571
Thousands of gallons of poison is injected
deep underground through a pipe.

566
00:46:56,634 --> 00:47:03,252
lmagine- the water, the soil,
even the crops...

567
00:47:03,305 --> 00:47:04,491
Everything gets infested with toxins.

568
00:47:04,549 --> 00:47:06,377
And that is chemical contamination.

569
00:47:06,433 --> 00:47:09,730
You can check for yourself,
the infected pumps

570
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,896
have been marked red,
they are banned.

571
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:15,568
If I get posted there, I'm done for.

572
00:47:15,626 --> 00:47:19,370
When I was shooting my documentary,
I saw for myself.

573
00:47:19,424 --> 00:47:21,470
Every home has a cancer patient.

574
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:27,628
Where were you that day?

575
00:47:27,883 --> 00:47:31,366
Sir. One Shot. I was at
the launch event with Paddy Sir.

576
00:47:31,425 --> 00:47:34,277
And I recorded a video as well.

577
00:47:36,788 --> 00:47:40,978
<i>Mere rabbis-rousing is not my aim...</i>

578
00:47:41,289 --> 00:47:43,270
<i>The who/e effort is
to make the wheels turn...</i>

579
00:47:43,332 --> 00:47:45,541
<i>Yes, the walls have begun
to tremble like curtains...</i>

580
00:47:45,598 --> 00:47:48,318
<i>But the point is that the foundations
must shake and churn...</i>

581
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:53,457
<i>If not in my heart,
your heart shall behold...</i>

582
00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:59,426
<i>Wherever the ﬁre be,
but for sure it must burn.</i>

583
00:47:59,483 --> 00:48:00,920
The foundations must shake...

584
00:48:02,707 --> 00:48:07,083
...54321.

585
00:48:09,313 --> 00:48:11,011
What's the deal here?

586
00:48:21,028 --> 00:48:22,856
This the emblem of NSG

587
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,280
Show me Parabjeefs bank details.

588
00:48:42,574 --> 00:48:44,620
This bugger has a clean record, ya!

589
00:49:53,626 --> 00:49:55,640
He sleeps on a pretty hard bed.

590
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:01,163
Who has been sending these
couplets to Bhagat Singh and why?

591
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:07,803
<i>The game of death is
clenched in your ﬁst...</i>

592
00:50:07,862 --> 00:50:10,997
<i>The north star looks down at you,
through the skies and mist.</i>

593
00:50:11,054 --> 00:50:12,969
There is definitely a cryptic
code message in this couplet.

594
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,310
Fist...

595
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:20,636
...V\/hat's in my fist?

596
00:50:22,577 --> 00:50:24,971
The fist is formed
by clenching the 5 fingers.

597
00:50:27,237 --> 00:50:28,173
Five fingers.

598
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:31,294
Five.

599
00:50:32,503 --> 00:50:34,005
My fist denotes the numerical 5...

600
00:50:37,642 --> 00:50:39,438
A game has players.

601
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,681
Boxing has 2 players.

602
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:42,632
Volleyball has 5 players.

603
00:50:42,686 --> 00:50:44,319
Basketball has 6

604
00:50:44,345 --> 00:50:47,382
Cricket and hockey have 11 players...

605
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,990
<i>The North star sees you from the sky...</i>

606
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:54,912
North star means the brightest star..

607
00:50:55,773 --> 00:50:58,745
The North Star is the brightest star.

608
00:51:00,337 --> 00:51:01,872
November is the 11th month...

609
00:51:06,562 --> 00:51:07,552
...Which means... 5.

610
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:14,072
5th November!

611
00:51:14,095 --> 00:51:15,564
He's quite a cunning rascal!

612
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:17,616
Fist...

613
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:21,734
This is smart guy.

614
00:51:22,586 --> 00:51:23,772
Smart gUY-

615
00:51:44,673 --> 00:51:47,231
So I was just doing
some research on you.

616
00:51:47,992 --> 00:51:52,694
We||- 1971 Bangladesh War,
Param Vir Chakra...

617
00:51:52,749 --> 00:51:57,189
...Operation Blue Star in 1984,
NSG Phantom Kargil...

618
00:51:59,612 --> 00:52:01,113
It's an honour to meet you Sir.

619
00:52:01,686 --> 00:52:04,212
Thank you. Not that you're
any less accomplished.

620
00:52:05,133 --> 00:52:08,746
Na><a| operations in Anantnag,
Ivlanipur, Kupwara...

621
00:52:09,985 --> 00:52:11,651
...Candidate for a gallantry award.

622
00:52:11,996 --> 00:52:13,530
Where were you on the 5th of November?

623
00:52:14,071 --> 00:52:17,368
By the way, the Kupvvara
operation- was it real or fake?

624
00:52:18,795 --> 00:52:20,395
5th November. Where where you?

625
00:52:21,796 --> 00:52:22,982
At my book launch.

626
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:23,976
Prior to that?

627
00:52:24,093 --> 00:52:26,172
If I keep an account of every second,
of every day then..

628
00:52:26,232 --> 00:52:28,953
then I will end up losing my mind.

629
00:52:29,168 --> 00:52:30,834
That's why I don't keep so
many tabs on myself.

630
00:52:33,063 --> 00:52:34,020
Where were you after retirement?

631
00:52:34,116 --> 00:52:34,824
Surely you remember that!

632
00:52:36,446 --> 00:52:39,233
I was seeking divine knowledge
in the company of great poets.

633
00:52:39,287 --> 00:52:40,158
Uh huh.

634
00:52:41,361 --> 00:52:43,343
<i>Those who Watch While others burn,</i>

635
00:52:43,372 --> 00:52:45,930
<i>Your straw houses will soon be graves,</i>

636
00:52:47,522 --> 00:52:49,894
<i>When Winds stoke the flames of death,</i>

637
00:52:50,012 --> 00:52:51,775
<i>How long will you be saved?</i>

638
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:55,161
<i>I kept quiet when they came for him,</i>

639
00:52:56,491 --> 00:52:57,776
<i>And thus the next turn was mine,</i>

640
00:52:59,779 --> 00:53:01,760
<i>As you stay mum while they murder me,</i>

641
00:53:03,481 --> 00:53:05,147
<i>You're going to be the next in line.</i>

642
00:53:07,089 --> 00:53:08,950
Your poetry is rather...revealing.

643
00:53:09,578 --> 00:53:12,266
That blast too,
wasn't it in one of your poems?

644
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:14,181
There was some code in that couplet...

645
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:19,419
<i>The ﬁre in my veins, must run through
yours too... Something like that?</i>

646
00:53:19,793 --> 00:53:22,764
<i>If not in my heart,
your heart shall behold,</i>

647
00:53:22,793 --> 00:53:24,871
<i>The ﬁres must bum...
Right!</i>

648
00:53:25,347 --> 00:53:27,296
It's a verse by the great poet
Dushyant, actually.

649
00:53:27,709 --> 00:53:32,530
In between facing and shooting guns,
I've developed quite a fondness for poetry.

650
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,779
L-low do you know Bhagat Singh'?

651
00:53:33,869 --> 00:53:34,446
Whiskey?

652
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:35,917
No, I'll have water.

653
00:53:37,221 --> 00:53:39,463
This whole operation
must have cost a bomb.

654
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:41,082
L-low did you get the money'?

655
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,495
It's safe, bottled.

656
00:53:47,371 --> 00:53:48,557
You have a wife?

657
00:53:49,222 --> 00:53:50,060
Yes.

658
00:53:50,244 --> 00:53:51,017
Girlfriend?

659
00:53:51,106 --> 00:53:52,096
Heh, no.

660
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:54,401
Ah, that's why you're asking all these
questions without a trace of evidence.

661
00:53:57,361 --> 00:53:58,102
Got kids?

662
00:53:59,053 --> 00:53:59,957
I have a son.

663
00:53:59,979 --> 00:54:01,230
Speak to him often?

664
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:02,760
Yeah, we spoke just the day before.

665
00:54:02,788 --> 00:54:05,444
He's in Patna, I'm here...
So we speak on the phone.

666
00:54:06,682 --> 00:54:09,207
The next time you speak, ask him

667
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:13,137
Does he see corpses in his dreams?

668
00:54:15,588 --> 00:54:17,960
Do deathly voices ring in his ears?

669
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,088
Have you got his blood tested?

670
00:54:22,322 --> 00:54:23,737
Your daughter's name is Ria, right?

671
00:54:26,089 --> 00:54:26,829
Yes.

672
00:54:27,621 --> 00:54:28,524
Where is she?

673
00:54:28,674 --> 00:54:30,405
Have you checked your son's nails?

674
00:54:30,462 --> 00:54:31,551
If they're turning yellow?

675
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,143
Where is she?

676
00:54:33,431 --> 00:54:35,989
Are his lips turning blue?

677
00:54:36,877 --> 00:54:37,813
Why did you choose Bhagat Singh?

678
00:54:37,835 --> 00:54:40,012
Does he wake up at night,
screaming and panting?

679
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:42,976
Does he see dead bodies,
getting sucked into a poisonous swamp?

680
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:44,800
What bloody swamp
are you talking about?

681
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:47,476
And stick to answering
what I'm asking you!

682
00:54:52,263 --> 00:54:53,765
This toxic swamp
filled with toxic water.

683
00:54:58,359 --> 00:55:02,006
This... I guess you forgot
this the last time?

684
00:55:04,136 --> 00:55:05,834
What can I say.
It's a professional hazard.

685
00:55:11,701 --> 00:55:14,389
The next time I visit,
get some Single Malt.

686
00:55:14,862 --> 00:55:18,246
I like Single Malts...
And I know you can afford it.

687
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,507
Sir I'm coming from scene of crime

688
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:26,226
I smell a huge conspiracy here.

689
00:55:26,704 --> 00:55:29,131
Sir, reverse boring,Chemicals
the factory blasts...

690
00:55:29,513 --> 00:55:30,764
This is the wheat bowl of India, Sir...

691
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:32,455
Which has fallen into
the jaws of a cancer epidemic.

692
00:55:32,705 --> 00:55:36,569
These 3O days of being posted here
has changed my entire thought process!

693
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,083
3O days have changed
your thought process?

694
00:55:40,524 --> 00:55:41,961
You're getting lots of big thoughts?

695
00:55:42,408 --> 00:55:45,792
Stay here for 3 months, all your big
thoughts will get fused like light-bulbs!

696
00:55:45,856 --> 00:55:46,367
Got it?

697
00:55:46,717 --> 00:55:47,011
Sorry Sir!

698
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:49,974
Don't tell me about your
nonsensical thoughts! Idiot.

699
00:55:50,037 --> 00:55:51,061
I'm so sorry.

700
00:55:54,888 --> 00:55:55,628
Get out

701
00:56:00,538 --> 00:56:02,138
Hello Little Master, what's up?

702
00:56:02,198 --> 00:56:05,517
I'm good Papa.
You're having your medicines, right?

703
00:56:06,316 --> 00:56:09,831
<i>Papa, the hero of Singham gives
the bad guys such a royal thrashing!</i>

704
00:56:09,891 --> 00:56:11,360
Have you ever bashed
up any criminals like that?

705
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:15,832
Policemen like that only exist in movies,
those who go around giving flying Kicks.

706
00:56:16,658 --> 00:56:21,512
And you stop watching all these films,
just takes you away from reality!

707
00:56:23,233 --> 00:56:24,168
Okay, listen?

708
00:56:24,222 --> 00:56:25,092
Yes?

709
00:56:25,563 --> 00:56:27,425
Do you dream often?

710
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:28,858
Yeah, of course!

711
00:56:28,947 --> 00:56:31,766
<i>I dream that you've turned into Singham
and are bashing up all the goons!</i>

712
00:56:34,213 --> 00:56:35,083
Goodnight.

713
00:56:35,554 --> 00:56:36,578
Good night papa.

714
00:56:38,969 --> 00:56:39,775
<i>Singham!</i>

715
00:56:40,629 --> 00:56:43,600
Sir, this room is like
a shrine to Paddy Sir.

716
00:56:44,331 --> 00:56:47,563
It's a shining testament
to his honesty and integrity.

717
00:56:49,023 --> 00:56:50,438
It seems you watch a lot of movies!

718
00:56:50,556 --> 00:56:52,950
Yes, first day, first show,
I'm always there at Gazala!

719
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,564
Blood reports?

720
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,993
Yes, all in order! Life Fountain Lab.

721
00:56:59,078 --> 00:57:00,744
They've been tested
at the Chandigarh Lab.

722
00:57:01,855 --> 00:57:05,502
In fact, Paddy Sir organizes
a blood donation camp every 6 months.

723
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:09,367
When I see his love for the city,
I get really emotional

724
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,600
Do you get emotional or are you terrified?

725
00:57:13,506 --> 00:57:17,337
So, what was the last film
you saw that you really enjoyed?

726
00:57:17,783 --> 00:57:18,719
<i>Singham.</i>

727
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,664
<i>Gosh, this Singham
follows me everywhere!</i>

728
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:39,937
Yes.

729
00:57:40,605 --> 00:57:43,131
I came to you with all the facts.

730
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:45,721
I'm the one who lost Anirudh.

731
00:57:45,744 --> 00:57:49,521
And you got me followed? Come on!

732
00:57:51,745 --> 00:57:53,922
You know,
I'm glad that blast happened.

733
00:57:54,011 --> 00:57:57,015
If it were up to me,
I'd blow up Paddy's bedroom.

734
00:57:57,299 --> 00:57:59,062
Watch him e><p|ode to shreds.

735
00:57:59,246 --> 00:58:00,780
You should be scared.

736
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,268
These are some strong
statements you are making.

737
00:58:04,736 --> 00:58:06,564
Looks like you didn't
read any of the research.

738
00:58:07,353 --> 00:58:09,019
If you would've,
you'd be the one getting scared.

739
00:58:09,684 --> 00:58:12,622
Everyone would be clear- who
made this plan, who is the victim.

740
00:58:12,684 --> 00:58:14,578
Everything would be cleared!

741
00:58:17,185 --> 00:58:18,273
L-low brave are you'?

742
00:58:21,046 --> 00:58:21,819
Wait.

743
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:35,667
This is Anirudh's post-modem report.

744
00:58:37,198 --> 00:58:38,156
The real one.

745
00:59:10,011 --> 00:59:13,113
What classified report
did Anirudh find?

746
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:17,228
Anirudh had caught hold
of the real blood samples...

747
00:59:17,672 --> 00:59:22,853
...which proved that there
were traces of cancer to be found.

748
00:59:23,513 --> 00:59:29,227
This entire Mother Teresa act that PPFPL
puts up with their blood donation drives?

749
00:59:29,865 --> 00:59:31,084
It's a big scam!

750
00:59:35,323 --> 00:59:36,706
Welcome to Radio FM.

751
00:59:36,728 --> 00:59:38,709
Do you know,
today is ‘Safe Water Day‘?

752
00:59:38,739 --> 00:59:41,558
But drinking the water of
our city is an invitation to death.

753
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:46,313
You'd probably be safer
consuming rat poison!

754
00:59:46,335 --> 00:59:49,339
So be safe,
be alert and think before you drink.

755
00:59:59,774 --> 01:00:00,351
Oye!

756
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:01,439
Yes Sir.

757
01:00:03,571 --> 01:00:05,237
What water did you use to make tea?

758
01:00:05,966 --> 01:00:07,152
Tap water, Sir.

759
01:00:09,157 --> 01:00:11,268
Get all your stuff here.

760
01:00:12,732 --> 01:00:14,974
From now on, you're going to
make tea right in front of me, got it?

761
01:00:15,062 --> 01:00:17,457
With this water, here catch!

762
01:00:18,701 --> 01:00:21,259
If you use tap water next time,
I'm gonna throw you in jail!

763
01:00:21,319 --> 01:00:22,440
Get that? - Sorry sir!

764
01:00:31,948 --> 01:00:33,385
What filth these guys have been up to!

765
01:00:38,428 --> 01:00:41,628
Talisker. 1O years Single Malt.
As per you request!

766
01:00:44,237 --> 01:00:48,013
Talisker is great, but I haven't
got the answer to my question.

767
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:52,409
Riya.

768
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,114
Her death certificate.

769
01:01:03,612 --> 01:01:04,450
What were you thinking?

770
01:01:04,729 --> 01:01:08,561
That if you destroy PPFPL,
Riya's soul would rest in peace?

771
01:01:09,229 --> 01:01:09,588
Huh?

772
01:01:10,538 --> 01:01:11,147
Revenge...

773
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:13,383
ls that what it is?

774
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:19,769
Not just the water,
even the blood here is owned by PPFPL.

775
01:01:21,742 --> 01:01:23,788
This city is alive only on paper.

776
01:01:23,977 --> 01:01:26,502
In reality, everyone's
e><piry date has already passed.

777
01:01:26,625 --> 01:01:30,457
Fountain Lab.
Mr Paddy is its biggest funder.

778
01:01:30,615 --> 01:01:34,327
Even their DNA samples
are made to order.

779
01:01:34,446 --> 01:01:37,798
And that's why you
got Riya's hair sampled?

780
01:01:38,372 --> 01:01:39,145
<i>Dawn?</i>

781
01:01:46,863 --> 01:01:48,016
You want PIVIO? Huh?

782
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,793
Tulsi Ram Hospital Bikaner,

783
01:01:55,385 --> 01:01:58,259
you'll get a confessional statement
from Bhagat Singh's widowed wife.

784
01:02:04,673 --> 01:02:05,217
Thank you

785
01:02:07,642 --> 01:02:09,916
Why do you want to
needlessly become a martyr?

786
01:02:13,483 --> 01:02:15,181
Bhagat Singh committed suicide.

787
01:02:16,037 --> 01:02:16,581
I'm sorry.

788
01:02:17,026 --> 01:02:18,180
Why sorry?

789
01:02:23,187 --> 01:02:24,340
About PPFPL...

790
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,651
Bhagat did it.

791
01:02:26,985 --> 01:02:28,586
He did it for my treatment.

792
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:30,083
For him.

793
01:02:33,592 --> 01:02:35,225
I'm ready to give a statement.

794
01:02:36,817 --> 01:02:38,417
I got a letter.

795
01:02:39,434 --> 01:02:42,373
The stranger who wrote it
knew everything about Bhagat.

796
01:02:42,976 --> 01:02:46,176
His problems, his helplessness.

797
01:02:47,701 --> 01:02:49,563
That he was buried in debt.

798
01:02:50,669 --> 01:02:51,572
Everything!

799
01:02:52,138 --> 01:02:54,990
I don't know how that
stranger knew about all this.

800
01:02:55,616 --> 01:02:57,282
All I knew is that.

801
01:02:58,617 --> 01:03:00,794
..money was to come into our account.

802
01:03:03,341 --> 01:03:06,160
It was a small price to
pay to secure our child's future.

803
01:03:07,235 --> 01:03:08,705
He paid it, my Bhagat.

804
01:03:18,918 --> 01:03:20,866
Can I ask for something
in exchange for this?

805
01:03:22,588 --> 01:03:23,329
Yes.

806
01:03:23,705 --> 01:03:25,980
Kindly take the return journey via train.

807
01:03:27,057 --> 01:03:30,409
Train number 54701.

808
01:03:35,483 --> 01:03:36,028
Q Kay-

809
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:45,481
Give me the file?

810
01:03:52,273 --> 01:03:52,785
Get the car.

811
01:03:52,816 --> 01:03:53,328
Yes Sir.

812
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:11,523
Uncle, don't smoke.
I have cancer. You'll get it too!

813
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:18,264
Tikoo, how many times have
I told you not to go alone'?

814
01:04:18,894 --> 01:04:20,461
Wait, slowly...

815
01:04:29,427 --> 01:04:32,083
He has bone cancer,
so his grip is weak...

816
01:04:33,098 --> 01:04:34,480
Which side do you belong to?

817
01:04:34,822 --> 01:04:35,366
As in?

818
01:04:35,779 --> 01:04:37,249
I mean, are you a patient
or an insurance agent?

819
01:04:37,726 --> 01:04:39,293
It's the cancer train, so I asked.

820
01:04:42,706 --> 01:04:45,014
Your hair looks fine!
So I guess there's no chemo involved.

821
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,590
Are you done, son?

822
01:04:48,164 --> 01:04:49,731
Go back to Bhatinda by train.

823
01:04:50,271 --> 01:04:53,656
Train number 54701.

824
01:04:54,324 --> 01:04:56,784
Blood, blood, blood!
A positive, B positive...

825
01:04:56,846 --> 01:04:57,455
blood, blood!

826
01:04:57,739 --> 01:04:58,861
Today's rate is 150 per packet!

827
01:04:58,889 --> 01:05:00,804
Yes! Buy two and get one free!

828
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,631
Blood, blood, blood, blood!

829
01:05:02,687 --> 01:05:04,156
Yes, anyone? Blood, blood!

830
01:05:04,443 --> 01:05:06,337
A Positive, B Positive, O Positive,

831
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:07,607
A Negative, B Negative!

832
01:05:07,666 --> 01:05:09,332
Chemo! First stage, Second stage!

833
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:10,708
Buy two and get one free!
- Chemo, Chemo Chemo, Chemo!

834
01:05:10,794 --> 01:05:12,046
Chemo package insurance,

835
01:05:12,136 --> 01:05:13,453
Chemo insurance, Chemo insurance!

836
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:15,076
Yes Uncle! Chemotherapy,

837
01:05:15,136 --> 01:05:18,042
Chemo, chemo, chemo...

838
01:05:20,019 --> 01:05:23,632
Look you know you are at the third
stage, there is no chance of survival.

839
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:25,192
So might as well secure
your family's future?

840
01:05:25,478 --> 01:05:29,026
As soon as the last rites are done,
the money gets credited into the account.

841
01:05:29,053 --> 01:05:30,914
My cut is 25 percent.

842
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:32,405
Come on, get it signed.

843
01:05:33,425 --> 01:05:34,677
What stage are you at?

844
01:05:35,979 --> 01:05:38,091
Chemo, Chemo Chemo!
First stage, Second stage!

845
01:05:38,118 --> 01:05:41,829
<i>The region that we are in today
is now the cancer belt of our country!</i>

846
01:05:41,916 --> 01:05:43,712
<i>Every home has a cancer patient now.</i>

847
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:08,699
<i>AH the high-rises in this city have
their foundations deep below in heH.</i>

848
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:13,331
<i>Ahirudh had caught hold
of the real blood samples.</i>

849
01:06:13,357 --> 01:06:15,272
<i>There were traces
of cancer to be found.</i>

850
01:06:20,315 --> 01:06:22,938
<i>This city is alive only on paper.</i>

851
01:06:23,092 --> 01:06:25,944
<i>In reality,
everyone's expiry date has passed.</i>

852
01:07:43,337 --> 01:07:45,764
The planning was the easiest bit.

853
01:07:47,072 --> 01:07:50,424
Because the combat was with one's own.

854
01:07:53,232 --> 01:07:55,887
A year of planning
and 3O seconds of combat.

855
01:07:59,999 --> 01:08:02,557
Only the right pest
can destroy the Paddy.

856
01:08:08,744 --> 01:08:10,987
I saw him on the cancer
train the first time.

857
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:13,926
That resourceful panther,
Sunday Singh.

858
01:08:14,842 --> 01:08:18,586
Used to fake blood reports at PPFPL.

859
01:08:19,182 --> 01:08:21,740
The most noble sacrifice in the world!

860
01:08:21,928 --> 01:08:23,114
Blood donation!

861
01:08:23,396 --> 01:08:24,354
Blood donation!

862
01:08:24,418 --> 01:08:25,539
Blood donation!

863
01:08:25,694 --> 01:08:29,274
Your very own blood donation drive!

864
01:08:33,387 --> 01:08:36,174
Expert at forging
fake certificates- Ricky.

865
01:08:44,654 --> 01:08:45,394
And..

866
01:08:46,729 --> 01:08:49,385
The insider- Bhagat Singh.

867
01:08:50,368 --> 01:08:52,317
I was aware of every
vein that ran through PPFPL.

868
01:08:57,294 --> 01:09:01,321
The money would reach them, and
the messages would reach Bhagat Singh.

869
01:09:01,699 --> 01:09:04,899
I had expertise in coding hence
all the messages were coded.

870
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:08,499
Each of them had their
own circumstances and dreams.

871
01:09:08,913 --> 01:09:10,927
Bhagat Singh's wife had cancer.

872
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:13,326
Sunday, the middleman.

873
01:09:13,541 --> 01:09:16,360
He had only one goal,
to make money at any cost.

874
01:09:17,116 --> 01:09:20,186
And Ricky's dream was to go to Canada.

875
01:09:21,233 --> 01:09:22,355
He also had cancer.

876
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:26,605
After the blast, I sent all three of them away

877
01:09:28,065 --> 01:09:31,417
In all this ,even today Bhagat
Singh was the one who got martyred.

878
01:09:36,332 --> 01:09:38,247
Terrorists only kill
a few thousands of people.

879
01:09:38,343 --> 01:09:42,271
These people are destroying the lives
of generations with their poison.

880
01:09:43,226 --> 01:09:45,120
The problem is of chemical contamination.

881
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:47,790
That is the potential cause of cancer.

882
01:09:48,972 --> 01:09:50,702
Shaheed Bhagat Singh had said,

883
01:09:51,429 --> 01:09:54,433
"For the deaf to hear,
blasts are needed".

884
01:09:54,908 --> 01:09:55,811
That's what I did,..

885
01:09:57,143 --> 01:09:59,669
..did such an explosion that their
eardrums were shattered.

886
01:10:04,931 --> 01:10:06,248
That day with my daughter, I died too.

887
01:10:08,187 --> 01:10:08,797
I just...

888
01:10:10,485 --> 01:10:12,825
wanted to destroy them
before I got reduced to ashes.

889
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:22,265
Do you think being good is a scam?

890
01:10:28,999 --> 01:10:33,538
Whether you call it the system,
a scam or life itself...

891
01:10:34,807 --> 01:10:36,058
That's what it is.

892
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:42,311
The fingers that pull my
trigger run strictly on orders.

893
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:46,874
I'm no superman,
who can override the system.

894
01:10:48,437 --> 01:10:51,256
But I'm not so weak either
to get crushed under it.

895
01:10:54,278 --> 01:10:55,530
Had studied it in Physics

896
01:10:56,704 --> 01:10:58,598
Balance defines equilibrium.

897
01:11:00,503 --> 01:11:01,527
That's exactly what I'm doing Sir.

898
01:11:02,641 --> 01:11:03,250
Balancing.

899
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:05,585
You're thinking the right thing.

900
01:11:14,739 --> 01:11:15,218
So...

901
01:11:18,122 --> 01:11:20,103
What beckons me?

902
01:11:22,048 --> 01:11:23,681
Asylum or custody?

903
01:12:11,204 --> 01:12:14,655
<i>Sleep my Child,</i>

904
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:18,901
<i>Sleep my Child,</i>

905
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:22,954
<i>I tuck you into</i> a <i>blanket</i>

906
01:12:23,173 --> 01:12:26,624
<i>Like the clouds cradle the moon</i>

907
01:12:26,876 --> 01:12:30,490
<i>I tuck you into</i> a <i>blanket</i>

908
01:12:30,611 --> 01:12:33,615
<i>Like the clouds cradle the moon</i>

909
01:12:34,313 --> 01:12:37,926
<i>The winds caress your cheeks</i>

910
01:12:38,048 --> 01:12:41,466
<i>As the universe fades
into tranquillity</i>

911
01:12:41,783 --> 01:12:45,907
<i>Like the clouds cradle the moon...</i>

912
01:12:52,443 --> 01:12:56,372
<i>Let the night sweep you</i> away

913
01:12:56,497 --> 01:13:00,110
<i>Into the land of dreams</i>

914
01:13:00,264 --> 01:13:03,779
Let <i>your</i> eyes soak <i>in</i> sweet bliss

915
01:13:03,934 --> 01:13:06,753
<i>As you rest in serenity</i>

916
01:13:06,807 --> 01:13:10,039
<i>l sing you</i> a <i>lullaby</i>

917
01:13:10,446 --> 01:13:13,798

01:13:14,245 --> 01:13:17,444
<i>l sing you</i> a <i>lullaby</i>

01:13:17,755 --> 01:13:21,053
<i>l sing you</i> a <i>lullaby</i>

920
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:24,906
<i>A little lullaby</i>

<i>l sing you</i> a <i>lullaby</i>

922
01:13:28,959 --> 01:13:32,442
<i>l sing you</i> a <i>lullaby</i>

01:13:32,598 --> 01:13:36,397
<i>A little lullaby</i>

924
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:59,379
<i>The fireflies play with you</i>

925
01:13:59,442 --> 01:14:03,023
<i>A game of hide and seek</i>

926
01:14:03,081 --> 01:14:06,880
<i>Heavenly rainbows await you</i>

927
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:10,360
<i>In the skies above</i>

928
01:14:10,742 --> 01:14:14,094
<i>As the dainty dewdrops</i>

929
01:14:14,157 --> 01:14:17,803
<i>Tickle your little feet</i>

930
01:14:17,891 --> 01:14:21,538
<i>May the night stand still</i>

931
01:14:21,626 --> 01:14:24,478
<i>And nudge the dawn</i> away

01:14:24,530 --> 01:14:28,013
<i>l sing you</i> a <i>lullaby</i>

01:14:28,234 --> 01:14:31,466

01:14:35,703 --> 01:14:39,000
<i>A little lullaby</i>

936
01:14:54,886 --> 01:14:58,750
<i>From behind the trees of heaven</i>

937
01:14:58,812 --> 01:15:02,425
<i>Angels call out to you</i>

938
01:15:02,515 --> 01:15:06,162
<i>As they shield you from the evil eye</i>

939
01:15:06,281 --> 01:15:09,220
<i>And all the pain in the world</i>

940
01:15:10,016 --> 01:15:13,434
<i>The breeze ﬂies in</i>

941
01:15:13,814 --> 01:15:17,166
<i>And genﬂy opens the window</i>

942
01:15:17,357 --> 01:15:20,938
<i>As the fragrance of calm</i>

943
01:15:20,996 --> 01:15:23,783
<i>Wraps you in its embrace</i>

944
01:15:23,837 --> 01:15:27,353
<i>l sing you</i> a <i>lullaby</i>

945
01:15:27,539 --> 01:15:31,186
<i>A little lullaby</i>

<i>l sing you</i> a <i>lullaby</i>

947
01:15:34,976 --> 01:15:38,807
<i>A little lullaby</i>

948
01:15:52,692 --> 01:15:54,325
My days are numbered, Papa.

949
01:15:56,395 --> 01:15:57,995
This wasn't in your
target plan, right?

950
01:16:02,203 --> 01:16:07,668
No, I forgot your target was for
me to run 200 meters in 2.5 mins.

951
01:16:08,491 --> 01:16:10,406
300 meters in 5 mins.

952
01:16:11,492 --> 01:16:12,363
Jogging...

953
01:16:13,472 --> 01:16:15,170
Daily showers in cold water.

954
01:16:17,046 --> 01:16:19,256
Air-force. Pilot.

955
01:16:20,749 --> 01:16:21,772
I knew it...

956
01:16:22,888 --> 01:16:23,845
That's why..

957
01:16:25,601 --> 01:16:28,191
I tried to be a son
rather than a daughter.

958
01:16:29,655 --> 01:16:31,070
As good as I could...

959
01:16:33,708 --> 01:16:39,335
But you know this
being good is a scam.

960
01:16:39,389 --> 01:16:43,253
It's all a scam.

961
01:16:43,859 --> 01:16:46,928
It's all a scam. Bloody scam.

962
01:16:53,402 --> 01:16:57,527
The sound of this running brook
that we are hearing right now...

963
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:00,682
I'll never be able to hear it again.

964
01:17:04,988 --> 01:17:10,833
I won't be able to feel the wind.

965
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:14,478
I won't ever be...

966
01:17:17,597 --> 01:17:19,230
able to see the mountains.

967
01:17:21,044 --> 01:17:21,654
This...

968
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:26,541
I want to live.

969
01:17:28,099 --> 01:17:34,585
I want to live.
l-low does it feel to breathe'?

970
01:17:36,302 --> 01:17:38,674
L-low does it feel to
have a man around you'?

971
01:17:47,761 --> 01:17:50,036
I failed you, sweetheart.

972
01:17:53,698 --> 01:17:55,493
I failed as a father.

973
01:18:01,454 --> 01:18:02,478
Goodnight Ria.

974
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:10,080
Today the report of an fire
accident has come in from Mensa Road.

975
01:18:10,136 --> 01:18:12,183
The Police has not given any official
statement confirming the nature of death.

976
01:18:12,243 --> 01:18:14,071
Whether it was suicide or murder.

977
01:18:14,254 --> 01:18:17,998
But Parabjeet Wa|ia's
charred corpse has been found.

978
01:18:18,084 --> 01:18:19,586
Sir please sir, we need to go in!

979
01:18:19,712 --> 01:18:21,475
Sir please sir, we need to go in!

980
01:18:22,425 --> 01:18:23,296
Sir please!

981
01:18:23,351 --> 01:18:24,505
Why are you pushing?

982
01:18:25,649 --> 01:18:26,389
Jai Hind sir

983
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:27,154
Sir please!

984
01:18:27,213 --> 01:18:27,539
Sir please!

985
01:18:27,596 --> 01:18:28,238
Sir please!

986
01:18:28,394 --> 01:18:29,135
Sir please!

987
01:18:30,948 --> 01:18:32,417
Sir one question please!

988
01:18:41,002 --> 01:18:41,710
Sir.

989
01:18:41,768 --> 01:18:44,522
Nobody will go beyond this point.
Block this area.

990
01:18:44,673 --> 01:18:45,609
Keep everybody inform ed.

991
01:18:47,227 --> 01:18:48,283
Sir is also here.

992
01:20:01,183 --> 01:20:06,168
Can you hear this voice?
Listen closely.

993
01:20:08,652 --> 01:20:09,871
This voice.

994
01:20:13,217 --> 01:20:14,719
It follows me day and night.

995
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:19,572
Doesn't let me sleep,
always keeps ringing in my ears

996
01:20:21,101 --> 01:20:23,343
From my ears to my breath.

997
01:20:26,144 --> 01:20:27,613
From the breath to my veins.

998
01:20:30,421 --> 01:20:31,803
From the veins to
my entire bloodstream.

999
01:21:14,725 --> 01:21:17,479
Hello. Hello.

1000
01:21:19,035 --> 01:21:19,743
Hello?

1001
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:48,116
Beauty care.

1002
01:22:46,748 --> 01:22:51,602
Sorry, I've come at the wrong time,
but Jeetu tried to threaten me again.

1003
01:22:57,410 --> 01:22:58,248
Wow.

1004
01:23:02,549 --> 01:23:05,868
Ammonium nitrate, selenium,
chromium, uranium, arsenic.

1005
01:23:05,964 --> 01:23:08,391
Everything is in the
ground water.

1006
01:23:09,794 --> 01:23:11,776
The reactor has DCIVI and Methanol...

1007
01:23:11,901 --> 01:23:14,524
But it only becomes poisonous
when the quantity is large.

1008
01:23:15,413 --> 01:23:18,167
And only Jeetu can solve this puzzle.

1009
01:23:18,413 --> 01:23:21,101
Because he has all
the confidential reports.

1010
01:23:22,179 --> 01:23:24,769
Aah. That was good.

1011
01:23:25,946 --> 01:23:26,904
That was good.

1012
01:23:27,733 --> 01:23:30,258
What is this? ls this even safe?

1013
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:31,317
Safe?

1014
01:23:31,532 --> 01:23:33,165
That is the purest form of water.

1015
01:23:33,511 --> 01:23:35,078
<i>Vodka and water.</i>

1016
01:23:35,362 --> 01:23:36,613
There is no better cocktail on earth.

1017
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:40,054
I thought its a cocktail of chemicals.

1018
01:23:41,905 --> 01:23:43,320
This town is a rainforest of venom,

1019
01:23:43,756 --> 01:23:45,999
where all the snakes
have their hoods raised.

1020
01:23:46,629 --> 01:23:50,406
Who is biting whom, no one knows.

1021
01:23:51,002 --> 01:23:53,821
And you know the official
term for this chemical chutzpah

1022
01:23:54,769 --> 01:23:57,141
is cocktail of chemicals.

1023
01:23:57,195 --> 01:23:58,316
Cocktail of chemicals.

1024
01:23:59,046 --> 01:24:05,087
Abdul, please drop Madam
to the Ajit Bibi road police station.

1025
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:07,958
Police station... But
why police station?

1026
01:24:09,802 --> 01:24:14,537
What would Jeetu like?
Cheese popcorn or butter popcorn?

1027
01:24:15,676 --> 01:24:16,666
I think butter popcorn.

1028
01:24:17,209 --> 01:24:17,753
What?

1029
01:24:17,814 --> 01:24:19,991
He seems the butter popcorn type.

1030
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:29,118
Would you like some popcorn?

1031
01:24:30,678 --> 01:24:32,626
Without popcorn one can't enjoy a film.

1032
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:34,859
What are you doing here?

1033
01:24:36,041 --> 01:24:39,720
To make a case we require a dead body.
I thought we might use your corpse.

1034
01:24:40,094 --> 01:24:42,619
What have I done?

1035
01:24:42,999 --> 01:24:44,088
Attempt to murder.

1036
01:24:45,584 --> 01:24:49,992
Maya Singh has filed
an FIR against your name.

1037
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:54,078
And this is Anirudh's post
mortem report. The authentic one.

1038
01:24:55,128 --> 01:24:59,700
You killed everyone, but made
a slight mistake. You left Maya alive.

1039
01:25:00,235 --> 01:25:01,226
That was a blunder on your part.

1040
01:25:02,502 --> 01:25:03,307
What do you want?

1041
01:25:03,555 --> 01:25:06,243
I want the secret recipe
of Paddy's chemical kitchen.

1042
01:25:08,183 --> 01:25:09,119
The reactor's chemical formula.

1043
01:25:10,322 --> 01:25:10,997
Huh?

1044
01:25:16,131 --> 01:25:17,066
I'll take your leave now.

1045
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:48,627
Yes, Jeetu?

1046
01:25:48,976 --> 01:25:51,219
Boss, that bloody clog followed
me to Gazala, the cinema!

1047
01:25:51,625 --> 01:25:53,965
Who? Arjun Ivlishra?

1048
01:25:54,307 --> 01:25:56,832
Boss, he has all the evidence.
He knows it all.

1049
01:25:56,988 --> 01:25:58,654
He even has Anirudh's
real post mortem report.

1050
01:25:58,935 --> 01:26:00,600
He said my name is
attached to all the crimes.

1051
01:26:00,818 --> 01:26:02,581
But you assured me that he
works under the Chief Minister.

1052
01:26:02,797 --> 01:26:05,964
But he is an entirely different beast.
He was asking about the reactor.

1053
01:26:06,787 --> 01:26:07,744
Did you blurt anything out?

1054
01:26:07,808 --> 01:26:11,106
No no. But he will
soon visit my house.

1055
01:26:11,383 --> 01:26:12,286
Please do something soon, boss.

1056
01:26:12,341 --> 01:26:14,290
I can't manage the
situation any longer.

1057
01:26:14,798 --> 01:26:18,347
Don't get stressed.
Go home and relax.

1058
01:26:19,906 --> 01:26:20,580
I'll look into the matter.

1059
01:26:21,694 --> 01:26:22,815
Okay. Okay Boss.

1060
01:27:49,185 --> 01:27:50,654
3 lines of cocaine,

1061
01:27:51,131 --> 01:27:52,927
but he hadn't sniffed even one.

1062
01:27:54,675 --> 01:27:57,907
The residue of the coke
is on the left nostril,

1063
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:00,175
whereas he is right handed.

1064
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:04,418
Shoulcfve been on the right.

1065
01:28:06,421 --> 01:28:09,621
If you look carefully,
there are marks on the neck.

1066
01:28:11,209 --> 01:28:12,907
They're definitely not birthmarks.

1067
01:28:14,656 --> 01:28:15,591
It's murder.

1068
01:28:21,614 --> 01:28:22,670
You use Davidoff?

1069
01:28:23,178 --> 01:28:24,909
No Sir, Lacoste.

1070
01:28:37,318 --> 01:28:39,016
<i>Those who Watch While others burn,</i>

1071
01:28:39,266 --> 01:28:41,443
<i>Your straw houses will soon be graves</i>

1072
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:44,765
<i>When winds stoke the ﬂames of death</i>

1073
01:28:45,011 --> 01:28:47,025
<i>How long will you be saved?</i>

1074
01:28:48,458 --> 01:28:51,277
Only Jeetu can give us
the answers to these questions.

1075
01:28:51,682 --> 01:28:53,630
He has all the confidential reports!

1076
01:28:53,693 --> 01:28:55,555
Like Grandma's recipe, eh?

1077
01:28:55,991 --> 01:28:58,386
They will take the
secret to their graves.

1078
01:28:59,790 --> 01:29:02,446
<i>I kept silent when they came for him,</i>

1079
01:29:03,396 --> 01:29:05,029
<i>And thus the next turn was mine,</i>

1080
01:29:05,312 --> 01:29:07,227
It's an open and shut case.

1081
01:29:07,386 --> 01:29:10,870
Just wrap it up and get
rid of it, without a sound.

1082
01:29:11,408 --> 01:29:13,781
<i>As you stay mum while they murder me,</i>

1083
01:29:14,345 --> 01:29:15,760
<i>You're going to be the next in line.</i>

1084
01:29:31,326 --> 01:29:32,447
Come on in.

1085
01:29:34,007 --> 01:29:34,997
Lord Shiva's picture?

1086
01:29:35,730 --> 01:29:36,786
<i>Jai Bhoienath!</i>

1087
01:29:38,061 --> 01:29:41,032
In your honour, we've made
Smoked Potato Mash today.

1088
01:29:42,848 --> 01:29:44,743
Potatoes go along with
pretty much any dish.

1089
01:29:45,721 --> 01:29:48,148
But no one orders it
at fancy 5 star hotels.

1090
01:29:48,531 --> 01:29:49,205
Why?

1091
01:29:52,552 --> 01:29:56,232
Because the potato
is a poor little thing.

1092
01:29:57,181 --> 01:29:58,715
A hero along with everything,

1093
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,095
but on its own, a zero.

1094
01:30:02,255 --> 01:30:03,692
Why did Parabjit visit your house?

1095
01:30:05,671 --> 01:30:09,469
You have a good life, a nice family
and kids- why are you messing around?

1096
01:30:11,129 --> 01:30:12,762
Ma'am I was just going to arrest him,
actually.

1097
01:30:15,534 --> 01:30:17,449
All you guys with cushy salaried jobs,
you turn into dogs.

1098
01:30:17,545 --> 01:30:18,122
Puppies.

1099
01:30:18,949 --> 01:30:20,745
Going around sniffing pointlessly.

1100
01:30:20,896 --> 01:30:24,129
A life of luxury awaits
you at the IBM's office,

1101
01:30:24,184 --> 01:30:26,524
and here you are rolling
about in this muck.

1102
01:30:27,152 --> 01:30:32,453
Paddy is our fundraiser.

1103
01:30:32,707 --> 01:30:35,134
DCIVI, Reverse boring...

1104
01:30:35,324 --> 01:30:36,706
these things are like balls of wool.

1105
01:30:37,112 --> 01:30:40,083
The more you try to unspool,
the more you get entangled.

1106
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:41,269
Pass the potato!

1107
01:30:43,846 --> 01:30:45,131
You don't want to
become a potato, do you?

1108
01:30:46,113 --> 01:30:47,680
If you're with us,
you'll remain a hero.

1109
01:30:49,943 --> 01:30:52,664
Nothing here moves
without my permission.

1110
01:30:53,614 --> 01:30:55,595
There's a press conference next week.

1111
01:30:56,167 --> 01:30:57,604
Parabjifs already committed suicide.

1112
01:30:58,337 --> 01:31:00,384
Just prove that he was mentally unstable.

1113
01:31:01,147 --> 01:31:03,803
I want the brief on my
table as soon as possible.

1114
01:31:04,882 --> 01:31:06,830
Or what's gonna happen,
Mr Arjun Mishra...

1115
01:31:07,562 --> 01:31:11,078
ls that you'll be transferred
to a Na><a|ite area.

1116
01:31:11,776 --> 01:31:15,324
Soon enough, your smiling face
will be in a frame like this,

1117
01:31:15,383 --> 01:31:17,429
ready to be garlanded and hung
on your wall in your loving memory.

1118
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:19,096
You're a sensible guy.

1119
01:31:21,352 --> 01:31:22,440
Care for some dessert?

1120
01:31:23,873 --> 01:31:24,809
No thanks, ma'am.

1121
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:26,014
Have some.

1122
01:31:27,129 --> 01:31:30,513
Get used to the perks
of the Phil's office... Eh?

1123
01:31:31,821 --> 01:31:33,040
By the way,
you can keep the gift there.

1124
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:34,766
Yes.

1125
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:39,715
What are you staring me for now serve?

1126
01:32:04,443 --> 01:32:05,466
How's it going, buddy?

1127
01:32:05,879 --> 01:32:07,446
Have you booked your tickets to Patna?

1128
01:32:07,826 --> 01:32:09,721
Katrina, Priyanka, Deepika bomb...

1129
01:32:09,837 --> 01:32:11,023
I've bought all the crackers!

1130
01:32:11,306 --> 01:32:12,775
We'll burst them together!

1131
01:32:12,933 --> 01:32:15,785
Listen bud, go for it
and burst them all by yourself.

1132
01:32:16,987 --> 01:32:19,001
So you're not coming
this time as well?

1133
01:32:20,977 --> 01:32:22,512
<i>It's time for me to become
your favorite Singham.</i>

1134
01:32:23,179 --> 01:32:25,454
Really'? Yay! Bash 'em all up together!

1135
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:33,783
Yes Sir.

1136
01:32:34,095 --> 01:32:34,803
Good job!

1137
01:32:34,926 --> 01:32:35,731
Thank you, Sir!

1138
01:32:36,203 --> 01:32:36,845
All set?

1139
01:32:37,256 --> 01:32:37,898
Yeah, I think.

1140
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:41,829
Davidoff? Coolvvater. Nice!

1141
01:32:42,555 --> 01:32:44,830
Sharp! Like a police dog.

1142
01:32:45,714 --> 01:32:47,129
Well, sometimes I bite too!

1143
01:33:00,493 --> 01:33:03,345
Madam, technology is
an amazing thing, isn't it?

1144
01:33:03,398 --> 01:33:05,379
You never know when it sneaks
up on you and bites you in the ass.

1145
01:33:05,537 --> 01:33:06,472
Have a look!

1146
01:33:07,483 --> 01:33:10,302
Lord Shiva's third
eye... it sees everything!

1147
01:33:15,719 --> 01:33:16,361
What do you want?

1148
01:33:16,421 --> 01:33:18,793
If you asked me 1O days back,
I might have asked for a good price.

1149
01:33:18,814 --> 01:33:20,796
For now, just read this.

1150
01:33:22,071 --> 01:33:22,680
Thank you!

1151
01:33:23,826 --> 01:33:25,622
<i>Resign now and save your ass.</i>

1152
01:33:26,315 --> 01:33:29,667
<i>l ‘m sure you can handle the rest.
After all, you're</i> a <i>politician.</i>

1153
01:33:44,701 --> 01:33:45,757
With a heavy heart,

1154
01:33:49,617 --> 01:33:53,742
I'd like to put in
my resignation today.

1155
01:33:57,149 --> 01:33:59,489
These tears are for my father,

1156
01:33:59,895 --> 01:34:02,137
who gave up his life for the people.

1157
01:34:02,703 --> 01:34:06,448
These tears are for the sacrifices
that I have made, for all of you.

1158
01:34:06,693 --> 01:34:09,697
Power and money flow like a stream,

1159
01:34:10,013 --> 01:34:11,711
from the top, right to the bottom.

1160
01:34:12,470 --> 01:34:14,365
Not from the middle, Mr Paddy!

1161
01:34:16,397 --> 01:34:18,030
The government belongs to its people.

1162
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:21,157
We're here to serve their interests,
not your greed!

1163
01:34:21,377 --> 01:34:26,231
You think you own the state?
Spreading your filth everywhere?

1164
01:34:26,611 --> 01:34:28,657
So many revolutions have
sprung from this rich land of ours,

1165
01:34:28,686 --> 01:34:31,560
and you want to drain
it with your reverse boring?

1166
01:34:32,325 --> 01:34:34,371
I owe everything
to the people of this state!

1167
01:34:34,432 --> 01:34:38,971
I'm not going to let
a cancer train run over them!

1168
01:34:40,337 --> 01:34:45,006
I had promised you that the
investigation will be done.

1169
01:34:45,061 --> 01:34:47,749
I'm really shocked

1170
01:34:50,678 --> 01:34:54,390
to tell you that the factory
blasts were done by Bhagat Singh

1171
01:34:54,508 --> 01:34:58,568
and his comrades Vicky
Bhullar and Sunday Singh,

1172
01:34:59,296 --> 01:35:01,277
whose lives were ruined
because of your factory!

1173
01:35:01,659 --> 01:35:03,041
They took revenge!

1174
01:35:04,084 --> 01:35:07,948
My heart bleeds to think that all of
this happened right in front of my eyes!

1175
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:11,627
I'd be insulting my father's legacy,

1176
01:35:11,809 --> 01:35:13,703
if I don't bring in a revolution!

1177
01:35:14,682 --> 01:35:17,337
If I let all these
sacrifices won't go in vain!

1178
01:35:17,746 --> 01:35:20,304
That's why I'm resigning.

1179
01:35:23,555 --> 01:35:24,905
But I'm not going anywhere.

1180
01:35:26,077 --> 01:35:27,938
I'm going to stay here
and serve the people!

1181
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:32,110
She's talking rubbish!

1182
01:35:34,631 --> 01:35:35,501
Utter lies!

1183
01:35:35,876 --> 01:35:37,607
Madam what's the reason
for your resignation?

1184
01:35:37,632 --> 01:35:39,547
Madam do you feel this Reverse Boring scandal

1185
01:35:39,610 --> 01:35:41,080
will usher in a new era in politics?

1186
01:35:41,143 --> 01:35:42,427
Sir,Sir,Sir, Please. ..

1187
01:35:43,505 --> 01:35:45,268
Sir Reverse Boring
is a criminal offence,

1188
01:35:45,324 --> 01:35:47,403
Sir you will have to compensate the people.

1189
01:35:47,463 --> 01:35:48,072
Yes absolutely...

1190
01:35:48,101 --> 01:35:49,386
Ground water is banned
because of your factories!

1191
01:35:49,474 --> 01:35:51,933
Industrial contamination has been
regarded as criminal offence

1192
01:35:51,963 --> 01:35:52,703
It's rubbish?

1193
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:54,843
Madam said it and you believed it?

1194
01:35:54,964 --> 01:35:56,978
Do you have any evidence?

1195
01:35:57,070 --> 01:35:57,745
Evidence?

1196
01:35:59,465 --> 01:36:00,553
It's right behind you.

1197
01:36:15,711 --> 01:36:16,767
Hello...

1198
01:36:17,562 --> 01:36:18,433
Hello, Paddy Sir?

1199
01:36:19,126 --> 01:36:23,251
The factory waste that we
were pumping into the ground...

1200
01:36:23,627 --> 01:36:24,781
The chemical level was pretty high.

1201
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:27,303
It's gotten leaked into
the municipal pipeline.

1202
01:36:27,649 --> 01:36:30,207
Stop all this! ls this a circus?

1203
01:36:30,937 --> 01:36:32,123
You know who you are talking to?

1204
01:36:32,181 --> 01:36:33,368
I own the state!

1205
01:36:33,905 --> 01:36:35,919
The CM, she runs on my orders.

1206
01:36:36,267 --> 01:36:38,542
Do all your protests outside!

1207
01:36:39,108 --> 01:36:41,601
It won't even take me 2 minutes to
make you disappear into thin air! Got it?

1208
01:36:41,661 --> 01:36:42,783
Eh, don't touch me!

1209
01:36:46,354 --> 01:36:47,344
Take him away!

1210
01:36:47,439 --> 01:36:49,006
You're screwed, Arjun Ivlishra!

1211
01:36:50,057 --> 01:36:51,275
Trying to threaten me, the rascal.

1212
01:36:56,281 --> 01:36:57,881
<i>What are you looking at?
Didn't you watch Singham?</i>

1213
01:36:58,707 --> 01:37:00,568
No, but now I must.

1214
01:37:12,368 --> 01:37:13,392
(Protests) DOWN WITH PPFPL!

1215
01:37:13,453 --> 01:37:15,183
PPFPL is in the midst of controversy.

1216
01:37:15,241 --> 01:37:17,995
The pumpimg of chemicals into
the ground due to Reverse Boring

1217
01:37:18,049 --> 01:37:19,845
has spread cancer throughout the city.

1218
01:37:19,901 --> 01:37:24,636
PPFPL will have to pay a fine to the
tune of 15000 crores corporate debt.

1219
01:37:24,752 --> 01:37:26,962
PPFPL hasn't just claimed victims,

1220
01:37:27,083 --> 01:37:30,380
but has affected entire
families across the state.

1221
01:37:30,562 --> 01:37:32,706
All their offices are
being seized and sealed.

1222
01:37:32,764 --> 01:37:34,015
As the controversy rages on,..

1223
01:37:34,105 --> 01:37:37,077
PPFPL has been revealed to
be a chemical mafia organization.

1224
01:37:38,893 --> 01:37:41,353
(Protests) Paddy F Sharma,
drown in hell!

1225
01:37:41,606 --> 01:37:43,108
(Protests) Paddy F Sharma,
drown in hell!

1226
01:37:43,170 --> 01:37:45,630
(Protests) Paddy F Sharma,
drown in hell!

1227
01:37:45,692 --> 01:37:48,348
(Protests) Paddy F Sharma,
drown in hell!

1228
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:26,335
Cheers!

1229
01:38:28,815 --> 01:38:31,405
Thanks for skipping the post-modem.

1230
01:38:31,911 --> 01:38:32,749
Welcome.

1231
01:38:33,602 --> 01:38:35,300
Whose body was it, by the way?

1232
01:38:35,805 --> 01:38:37,241
L-low does it matter, Sir'?

1233
01:38:44,998 --> 01:38:46,054
So, did you get to the PIVIO?

1234
01:38:47,902 --> 01:38:51,037
It's funny.
I've been promoted so many times.

1235
01:38:52,148 --> 01:38:56,817
But I've never felt
like my son is proud of me.

1236
01:38:57,670 --> 01:39:00,772
Now for the first time, I've been
demoted, and he thinks I'm a hero.

1237
01:39:03,447 --> 01:39:05,014
So, Naxals...

1238
01:39:05,107 --> 01:39:06,522
Yes Na><a|..

1239
01:39:11,203 --> 01:39:12,999
So what name have you thought of,
for your passport?

1240
01:39:13,725 --> 01:39:14,814
John F Kennedy,

1241
01:39:15,545 --> 01:39:16,350
John Lennon,

1242
01:39:16,629 --> 01:39:17,467
John Abraham...

1243
01:39:18,481 --> 01:39:19,505
No? No Johns?

1244
01:39:20,715 --> 01:39:22,609
Che Guevara.

1245
01:39:23,652 --> 01:39:24,523
Suits you well!

1246
01:39:25,631 --> 01:39:26,589
Birds of a feather...

1247
01:39:29,238 --> 01:39:29,912
Good.

1248
01:39:30,164 --> 01:39:30,741
Cheers!

1249
01:39:30,802 --> 01:39:31,737
Cheers!
