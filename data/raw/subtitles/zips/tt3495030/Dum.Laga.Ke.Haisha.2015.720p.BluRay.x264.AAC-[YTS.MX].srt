3
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:44,001
HEAVE-HO, CARRY THAT LOAD

4
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:50,001
Three things in this world...

5
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,792
...bring tears to my eyes

6
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:54,917
Papa's shoe

7
00:00:55,626 --> 00:00:57,167
English exams

8
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:59,167
And singer Kumar Sanu's voice

9
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,042
All painful

10
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:19,626
You...

11
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:34,292
You are the answer to
my every question

12
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:51,417
You are the heart
of all my stories

13
00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:12,167
Didn't I tell you?

14
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,792
Don't record with headphones.
You'll burst your ear-drums

15
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:18,251
- What did you say?
- What did I say?

16
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:22,042
The Rishikesh priest asked us
to see the girl

17
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:23,917
He wants us to come to
the temple tomorrow

18
00:03:25,251 --> 00:03:28,167
Finish the recording today

19
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,667
What is this mess?
Throw this out

20
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:33,626
Yes, Papa

21
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:36,251
Here's 20 rupees

22
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:37,667
Yes, Papa

23
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:41,417
Don't let the cows get into
the shop

24
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:42,417
Yes, Papa

25
00:03:52,251 --> 00:03:54,417
Jaya! Did you bring the lemon pickle?

26
00:03:57,167 --> 00:04:00,042
Have you got money
for the temple?

27
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:09,876
Prem, get in the back.
There's no time

28
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,376
Hurry up!

29
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:22,876
Ma, my saree is untying

30
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:25,542
I told you to tie it with a pin

31
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:27,417
Hold it

32
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:29,417
Let your father pass

33
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:33,917
Hold your breath in

34
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:36,751
Tuck your saree in

35
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:42,042
Cover your head. We're going to
a temple, not to your college

36
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,626
I can't find the saree end

37
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:52,792
- What are you doing?
- Why didn't you oil your hair?

38
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:53,917
Tell him...

39
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,126
...to sit with confidence

40
00:04:57,501 --> 00:04:59,417
No need to misbehave

41
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:01,917
You're our only son, our pride

42
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:06,167
Don't chomp on your food.
Don't spit when you talk

43
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:09,667
You talk as though I'd
never seen a girl before

44
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:13,667
You want some water?

45
00:05:14,042 --> 00:05:15,917
How far is the temple?

46
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:19,792
Someone's getting restless
to see the girl

47
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:33,292
Let's introduce ourselves

48
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:37,167
The girl's father, Madan Pal

49
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:41,751
The boy's father,
Chandra Prakash Tiwari

50
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:44,167
His wife, Subhadra Rani

51
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:46,876
Boy's mother, Shashi Tiwari

52
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:52,376
Boy's sisters, Jaya and Hema
and their husbands

53
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:56,917
She's my younger sister.
Prem's aunt, Naintara

54
00:05:57,417 --> 00:06:01,501
I think the boy and girl should
introduce themselves

55
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:02,792
Absolutely

56
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:07,001
Sandhya

57
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:10,292
Sandhya

58
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,917
Prem, introduce yourself

59
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:15,292
You've done it, Papa

60
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:25,001
One person missing, Samar.
Sandhya's younger brother

61
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:28,501
He has exams,
so he isn't here

62
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:31,042
- Is Sandhya educated?
- A degree in teaching

63
00:06:31,126 --> 00:06:34,126
She's wanted to teach
since childhood

64
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:37,292
She even taught her dolls maths

65
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:43,542
Ask him yourself

66
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:47,126
She asks if Prem is educated

67
00:06:48,751 --> 00:06:51,417
Prem has a degree in Commerce

68
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:54,167
He's always been keen
on accounting

69
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:57,167
He's more interested in
bank notes than books

70
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:09,292
Think it over and tell me

71
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:11,667
I already have

72
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:13,376
What do you say?

73
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:18,667
The girl is lovely. Did you
notice her good nature?

74
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:22,042
She didn't speak.
You talk of her nature

75
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:26,042
Being silent in front of her elders
is a sign of a good nature

76
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:30,167
So you prefer the girls who
waste time in your shop...

77
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:31,792
...recording songs?

78
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:35,167
You listen! She's a nice girl.
That's it

79
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:38,042
A nice girl! And her appearance?

80
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:39,667
What's wrong?

81
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,042
Is she blind, deaf, mute, crippled?

82
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,792
Saw her size? Huge

83
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:48,751
You're no movie star,
you high school dropout

84
00:07:51,126 --> 00:07:53,376
It's the food these days

85
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:57,417
Your sister put on pounds
after she got married

86
00:07:57,417 --> 00:08:00,292
Her husband still loves her

87
00:08:00,376 --> 00:08:03,292
They chose each other.
What choice do I have?

88
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:05,376
To hell with your choice

89
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:09,042
Your choice will turn your parents
into paupers

90
00:08:09,126 --> 00:08:12,667
Papa, talk to him gently,
he'll understand

91
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,292
So, you try

92
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:16,251
Listen, son

93
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:21,876
If she was attractive, we'd have
to buy her cosmetics

94
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:27,501
She'll earn money. She's going to
be a teacher

95
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:30,542
- It'll help us
- I will not marry her

96
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:33,501
- That's it
- How dare you!

97
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:40,751
Do it, Prem. For the family's sake

98
00:08:58,042 --> 00:09:02,167
I'll look for a lovely special girl

99
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:10,001
Not temporary, someone permanent

100
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:22,042
I'll look for a big earner,
sober and sweet

101
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:26,292
Not temporary, someone permanent

102
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:44,042
Eyes like a golden fairy

103
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,042
A magic wand in her hand

104
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:50,042
I'll look for the perfect bride

105
00:09:50,126 --> 00:09:54,042
He'll have a bike and a car,
good manners too

106
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:58,542
I'll consider him,
that's if he's faithful

107
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:04,042
She'll go with me to visit Shimla,
Kullu Manali

108
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:08,042
But not forget to buy veggies on
her way home from work

109
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:11,126
That's the one for me

110
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:19,917
I'll look for a graduate, a lively,
cheeky type

111
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:23,667
Not a fellow who looks old and grumpy

112
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:27,626
He's a man who masters
household chores

113
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:31,501
No, no ordinary type, you see

114
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:36,417
A deluxe model will suit me

115
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:06,876
Are you ok?

116
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,792
My head is about to explode

117
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:21,751
Take a pill. You'll feel better

118
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:26,792
You want to die at your
own wedding?

119
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:47,417
I told you - don't drink milk
after Chow mien

120
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:54,417
Papa, it's his allopathic meds.
He's throwing them up

121
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:56,626
No one stops him

122
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,542
Give him some soda,
he'll be ok

123
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:12,667
I really like the scent of marigolds

124
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:15,792
Welcome

125
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,542
See how beautiful the room looks

126
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:21,667
Prem's aunt hand-picked the flowers

127
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:24,542
- Prem loves them
- She sneezed

128
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:27,417
You have a cold?

129
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:29,876
I'm allergic to flowers

130
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:35,001
We'll get rid of them
in the morning

131
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:38,292
The room is decorated
with a lot of love

132
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:41,417
Remove all the flowers

133
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:53,626
Where is it?

134
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:59,542
Don't rush things in bed

135
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:03,292
Let her get a job first.
Babies can come later

136
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,667
On paid maternity leave

137
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:07,667
You feeling ok?

138
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:05,167
The bathroom?

139
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:07,542
Change here

140
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:09,126
Ok

141
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:12,251
Wait. I'll go out

142
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,251
You can come in

143
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:07,876
Sandhya

144
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:11,542
- A call for you
- Coming, Mummyji

145
00:16:38,251 --> 00:16:40,542
Hope I didn't wake you

146
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:46,292
- How did you get this number?
- So, how was last night?

147
00:16:46,376 --> 00:16:49,167
He behaved like a child...

148
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:51,417
... abandoned somewhere

149
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:57,667
He slept in one corner of the bed,
me on the other

150
00:16:58,042 --> 00:17:01,792
Listen, I'll call you later. Bye

151
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:14,792
Wake the Prince of Celibacy
out of his slumber

152
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:16,917
Don't talk so loud

153
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:19,001
She can hear you

154
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:22,667
You worry about being overheard.
But not about your son

155
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:26,667
Don't blame him. She could've
made the first move

156
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:29,042
She's arrogant

157
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:31,667
Just because she's educated

158
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,626
She didn't even greet me
at the wedding

159
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:37,417
Giggled away with her family

160
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:41,292
Sure! We aren't in her league

161
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:44,042
Why blame the poor girl?

162
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:46,792
Think of how she must feel

163
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:49,792
Our son is work-shy.
He's so arrogant

164
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:53,667
A boy like him should be
taught a lesson

165
00:17:55,126 --> 00:17:56,667
Good morning, Mr. Groom

166
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:59,417
- Where to?
- The Youth Club

167
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:02,126
The Youth Club will ruin you

168
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:05,792
You want to become a freedom
fighter. Can't kill a fly

169
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,417
- We'll talk later
- Wait a minute

170
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:10,626
Yes, we'll talk later.
Look at me

171
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:13,542
Look at me. Well?

172
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:19,001
You can hit me if you want.
I'll do as I please

173
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:22,042
One whack will sort you.
Where's my shoe?

174
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:24,542
Don't hit him

175
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:29,917
How sweet! She's made us tea

176
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:36,251
Prem is at the Youth Club. He loves
working out, since childhood

177
00:18:36,292 --> 00:18:38,917
Is your family into fitness?

178
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:42,792
Only Papa. I do yoga at home

179
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:45,667
It shows

180
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:52,792
We salute those great men

181
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:56,667
The great men who have given us
the wisdom of life

182
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:03,917
We bow a hundred times to
those great men

183
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:10,126
Remember the martyr Bhagat Singh

184
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:12,542
The leader Subhas Chandra Bose

185
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:15,292
Shivaji Maharaj and Vajpayeeji

186
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:19,042
Do you think any of these great men
lacked focus?

187
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,876
No

188
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:22,417
So, let's promise ourselves

189
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,542
To let their lives inspire us

190
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:27,917
To follow in their footsteps

191
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,001
Of course!

192
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:32,917
- I have news. Prem is married
- Congratulations!

193
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:35,626
- That calls for a party
- Yes

194
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:38,251
Papa is against inviting riff-raff

195
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:42,042
I agree with him. I'm against
parties too

196
00:19:42,126 --> 00:19:43,167
So be it!

197
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:46,917
Study hard, ok?

198
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,501
Give it to Jaya

199
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:54,126
- Take care of our Prem
- Sure

200
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:58,001
Give us a missed call.
Ring once, and you ring twice

201
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:01,042
Go safely

202
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:04,167
I don't know what's
happening to me

203
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:07,542
So run away

204
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:09,417
Who is stopping you?

205
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,001
I couldn't make high school

206
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:16,417
The computer course was in English.
I'm zero at it

207
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:19,251
Papa pushed me into marrying

208
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:22,001
And you're saying I must run away?

209
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:29,167
Mom, it's the first day.
Things take time

210
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:32,042
I woke up late today

211
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:34,876
The alarm didn't ring

212
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:37,376
No action and you wake up late

213
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:40,917
If this goes on, your in-laws
will send you home

214
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:44,542
Mridula can't keep anything
to herself

215
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:54,292
God has been kind to you.
You married a video tape guy

216
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:57,542
Ask him to show you an erotic film

217
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:00,542
It'll give you ideas

218
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:04,667
Rebel

219
00:21:05,251 --> 00:21:08,292
Rebel until you find a way out

220
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:12,792
I can't rebel. But in the bedroom
I can

221
00:21:13,292 --> 00:21:14,626
It's my battlefield

222
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:17,751
If he is a little shy,
make the first move

223
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:20,751
Pleasing your husband is
your responsibility too

224
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:24,417
Walk slowly, please

225
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:31,251
I've finished engineering.
Have some sweets

226
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:32,376
Prem!

227
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:35,542
Straight and first right. You'll see
Vijay's shop. I have work

228
00:21:35,542 --> 00:21:37,292
Aren't you coming?

229
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:40,417
Just take one piece - not
the whole box

230
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:44,792
You know Vijay. What will I do
in a ladies' store?

231
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:46,667
- See you later
- Listen!

232
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,042
Namaste, sister-in-law

233
00:21:55,251 --> 00:21:58,042
- Will you have some tea?
- No, thanks

234
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:00,626
Where's Prem?

235
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:02,292
He's busy

236
00:22:03,292 --> 00:22:04,751
I need some stuff

237
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:08,751
- These bangles are lovely
- Not bangles

238
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:10,042
Something like that

239
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:16,417
See this

240
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,167
No. Next to that

241
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:25,376
- This one?
- The one above

242
00:22:26,626 --> 00:22:30,292
Sister, show them to her.
I have work

243
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,167
Can I help?

244
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:35,876
A nightgown?

245
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:39,167
- Sure. Any undergarments?
- Only the nightgown

246
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:45,167
It will really suit you

247
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:48,542
That's fine

248
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,376
And this is the inner...

249
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:53,417
All right. I'll take it

250
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:11,792
Tell me when you're done
inspecting them

251
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:14,751
I was looking at their handbags

252
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:16,167
Sure you were

253
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:24,001
Hey Prem, is that your wife?

254
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:25,292
Yes

255
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:28,042
- You brought your wife shopping?
- I'm Sandhya

256
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:28,917
That's Pervin

257
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:32,167
Very pretty. Visit me some day

258
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:35,167
I live nearby. Drop by sometime

259
00:23:35,292 --> 00:23:37,917
- Hurry!
- Just shut up and wait

260
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,792
Tehmina, get my purse

261
00:23:43,292 --> 00:23:47,417
- Let me talk
- Why do you want to talk to her?

262
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:53,251
Have some sweets. I've just
finished my engineering degree

263
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:56,167
Easy. I have to give some
to the others

264
00:23:57,542 --> 00:24:01,501
What was the big hurry?
You didn't let me talk

265
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:07,501
Why are you getting angry?
What have I done?

266
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:13,042
I am talking to you

267
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:16,292
Take me to the government library

268
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:19,292
Ok, I'll walk home

269
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:10,667
- I'm telling you straight
- This is a library

270
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,417
I don't like talking to people

271
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:26,917
Who asked you to talk?
I was talking

272
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:28,792
What's your problem?

273
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:32,751
I don't like chatting with
all those shopkeepers

274
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:36,126
I don't like being interrupted either

275
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:41,167
Does it bother you if
I talk to someone?

276
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,667
You don't know these people

277
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:48,417
When I am alone, they will
get after me

278
00:25:49,042 --> 00:25:51,417
Where's the celebration?

279
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:53,667
My father was right

280
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:57,667
People here like keeping
their money locked up

281
00:26:27,292 --> 00:26:32,542
Sandhya wants to see a film. Papa
is setting up the VCR

282
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:36,917
She should've got her own TV.
Why must we miss the soap?

283
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:41,917
Nothing happens in those soaps.
You won't miss anything

284
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:45,292
I'm hanging up. Ask Hema to call

285
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:49,292
Can I please close the window?

286
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:52,376
Sure. Lock it

287
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:06,042
Listen

288
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,667
Please close the window

289
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:10,626
The window

290
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:27,542
Can you set up the VCR?

291
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:07,876
Are you ready?

292
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:22,292
"Martyrs' Day"

293
00:28:23,751 --> 00:28:25,417
Aren't you watching?

294
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:27,292
Not in the mood

295
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:30,667
Send the TV back

296
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,542
- I'll tell Papa...
- Why tell Papa?

297
00:28:34,376 --> 00:28:37,251
We'll watch it together

298
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:45,792
Put the light off

299
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:44,417
Quilt?

300
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:14,626
Water?

301
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,751
Our child just became a man

302
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:49,042
Bless us, Lord

303
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:51,167
Where are you going?

304
00:30:51,626 --> 00:30:55,626
I want to share the good news
with my daughters

305
00:30:56,542 --> 00:30:58,167
Tell them tomorrow

306
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:14,292
Did you see the whole film?

307
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:18,042
I don't get tired halfway like you

308
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:20,126
I saw it till the end

309
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:28,251
Who heats the water at your place?

310
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:30,251
We have a geyser

311
00:31:31,126 --> 00:31:32,792
- Did you have breakfast?
- No

312
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:37,751
How did your exams go?

313
00:31:37,792 --> 00:31:40,292
Maths was tough as usual

314
00:31:40,626 --> 00:31:42,167
Make sure you pass

315
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:46,001
No one in our family has failed.
I want top marks

316
00:31:46,501 --> 00:31:51,126
You talk like your family inherited
the world's brains

317
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:56,167
She is Prem's aunt

318
00:31:58,376 --> 00:31:59,417
You leaving?

319
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:00,751
She's going

320
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:03,626
- Let your brother eat
- I've eaten

321
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:06,626
They don't eat much.
But every grain shows

322
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:11,792
It's called metabolism

323
00:32:12,292 --> 00:32:13,751
My respects

324
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:18,167
Where's Prem?

325
00:32:18,251 --> 00:32:21,417
What are you doing?
Help her with the luggage

326
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:27,042
Give my regards to your father

327
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:28,626
Travel safe

328
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:45,667
I left a list of songs on the table

329
00:32:45,751 --> 00:32:48,542
- Record them for me
- If I have the time

330
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:50,667
Come on the 4th

331
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:53,792
- Why?
- Why do you think?

332
00:32:53,876 --> 00:32:55,667
Let's go, Samar

333
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,042
I couldn't say no to Papa
about marrying

334
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:11,792
I couldn't stop myself last night

335
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:16,251
Domestic life is going to
drag me into quicksand

336
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:20,667
What can I teach a person
who has no will power?

337
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:24,251
I feel suffocated. What will
power do you mean?

338
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:28,626
Don't live in denial.
Just accept the reality

339
00:33:29,376 --> 00:33:32,042
How can I accept someone
I am not attracted to?

340
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:48,542
How do I look?

341
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:51,167
Do whatever, you will always
look a witch

342
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:53,876
Want a slap?

343
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:02,042
This is my life now

344
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,126
A gravitational pull is sucking me

345
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:08,042
Accept defeat then

346
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:11,292
It's not gravity

347
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:14,001
The pleasure in bed
is pulling you

348
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:17,542
Don't be ashamed of pleasure

349
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:22,167
It is not pleasure.
It's compulsion

350
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:27,001
So enjoy your compulsions.
Why else are you on earth?

351
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:35,917
All objects in this universe
are drawn to one another

352
00:34:38,501 --> 00:34:41,167
The law of gravity

353
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:48,167
So why do some objects
not meet...

354
00:34:48,292 --> 00:34:50,417
...and stay fixed in their place?

355
00:34:50,876 --> 00:34:51,917
Although...

356
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:57,501
...they want to reach out to
one another, they cannot

357
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:14,292
Play

358
00:35:14,376 --> 00:35:16,292
- From here?
- Press

359
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:19,292
Listen to the sound

360
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,292
Son, is this a CD?

361
00:35:21,376 --> 00:35:25,417
A CD - a compact disc.
This is the future

362
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:27,542
Give up the old stuff

363
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:34,042
Listen to the sound

364
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:38,501
Really good

365
00:35:39,042 --> 00:35:43,251
I'll get you a good deal. About 150K.
Plus a CD player

366
00:35:43,376 --> 00:35:45,417
How much for this lot?

367
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,542
There are no buyers for this

368
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:51,542
Cassettes are only sold as scrap

369
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:54,292
No one cares for them

370
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:58,626
We'll have to start the business
from scratch

371
00:35:58,917 --> 00:36:01,417
Why can't we get a loan?

372
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:07,126
I haven't repaid the loan I took
for my daughter's wedding

373
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:09,542
I told you

374
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:11,917
No borrowing money

375
00:36:13,042 --> 00:36:14,792
Suggest something then

376
00:36:15,251 --> 00:36:18,001
I suggest you put the radio
under your pillow

377
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:20,417
Listen to Kumar Sanu's love songs

378
00:36:20,626 --> 00:36:21,792
We'll manage somehow

379
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:26,751
- When do you get Sandhya?
- On the 4th

380
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:28,667
That's today

381
00:36:29,001 --> 00:36:31,917
She's waiting for him
and he's busy hogging

382
00:36:32,376 --> 00:36:33,751
Give him more food

383
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:43,542
Why don't you call him?

384
00:36:43,626 --> 00:36:45,292
He could call me

385
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:47,292
Are you keeping score?

386
00:36:47,417 --> 00:36:49,792
Anyway I'm better than he is

387
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,417
Papa, please eat

388
00:36:53,292 --> 00:36:55,167
Samar, come and eat

389
00:36:56,292 --> 00:36:59,917
Don't give me too much.
Leave something for Prem

390
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:01,792
There's no need

391
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:24,292
I'll go check

392
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,542
Prem, welcome

393
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:37,376
We were expecting you

394
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:42,251
- God bless you, son
- Get him some snacks

395
00:37:44,251 --> 00:37:45,501
Hello, brother-in-law

396
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:48,542
- Give him a plate
- No, thanks

397
00:37:48,626 --> 00:37:50,876
- I have an early start
- Eat something

398
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:53,042
No thanks

399
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:58,417
Shall we go?

400
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:04,626
Prem, keep this money

401
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:06,751
No, please no

402
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:08,667
Take it. It's for good luck

403
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:11,292
Keep it. Buy something for me

404
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,376
Hold on to your bag

405
00:38:43,292 --> 00:38:45,626
- What's wrong?
- I'm hungry

406
00:38:46,126 --> 00:38:48,126
But you said you ate

407
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:59,417
Sit here. I'll sit over there

408
00:39:01,167 --> 00:39:03,542
Give me some kachori
with onions

409
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:05,292
You eat onions?

410
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:09,501
- Yes. But my family don't
- My family eats onions

411
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:13,167
Must you go on about your family?

412
00:39:13,376 --> 00:39:16,542
We eat onions. We don't sleep
before 12

413
00:39:16,626 --> 00:39:19,167
What can I do if you all lie?

414
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:23,667
At least I know something
about you now

415
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:25,667
You smoke?

416
00:39:26,126 --> 00:39:28,501
And drink. No one drinks
in your family?

417
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:29,292
No

418
00:39:40,376 --> 00:39:42,251
Don't tell anyone

419
00:39:42,751 --> 00:39:44,876
Will your father hit you?

420
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:48,792
I am not scared of anyone

421
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:52,001
You're the fearless
warrior of the family

422
00:39:52,042 --> 00:39:53,376
Eat up

423
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:03,126
- Want some?
- No, thank you

424
00:40:10,626 --> 00:40:14,501
The threads of endearment...

425
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:18,792
...are entangled in your fingers

426
00:40:29,626 --> 00:40:33,167
I cannot find a way...

427
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:37,042
...to untie the knot

428
00:40:37,126 --> 00:40:42,042
My life is like that star...

429
00:40:48,292 --> 00:40:53,167
...that passes through the clouds

430
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,292
You must be a little crazy

431
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:50,001
To have chosen me

432
00:41:52,417 --> 00:41:55,542
How did you hear...

433
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:58,917
...my unspoken words?

434
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:07,626
What's wrong?

435
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:09,292
I want some water

436
00:42:09,751 --> 00:42:11,292
I'll get it

437
00:42:20,876 --> 00:42:24,001
The girls today know everything

438
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,792
What's good or bad for them

439
00:42:29,042 --> 00:42:33,417
Good or bad... they also
enjoy their youth more

440
00:42:34,001 --> 00:42:36,292
But what does Prem know?

441
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:40,542
Weren't you excited when
you were young? Wasn't I?

442
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:44,376
It's their time to have fun

443
00:42:46,001 --> 00:42:47,792
Need something?

444
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:51,876
He was feeling hot

445
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:56,667
You're shameless! Hush

446
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:11,876
Here

447
00:43:43,751 --> 00:43:45,542
Did you record my songs?

448
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:48,792
What?

449
00:44:03,501 --> 00:44:05,167
The spices are on the top shelf

450
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:09,042
- Sugar and tea down below
- Where's my medicine bottle?

451
00:44:09,126 --> 00:44:11,667
I threw it out. The meds had expired

452
00:44:11,876 --> 00:44:15,001
You threw it out?
I bought it two months ago

453
00:44:15,042 --> 00:44:18,876
Expired pills are not good
for the health

454
00:44:19,417 --> 00:44:23,292
Don't show off your education.
I know what expiry means

455
00:44:23,376 --> 00:44:25,292
I was trying to help

456
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:28,001
Why do you keep taunting me?

457
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:30,792
I asked about my medicine bottle

458
00:44:31,292 --> 00:44:34,667
If you must, here it is

459
00:44:35,917 --> 00:44:38,251
Answering back, eh?

460
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:39,792
We'll talk later

461
00:44:40,042 --> 00:44:43,501
The way you talk. Making
a mountain out of a molehill

462
00:44:43,542 --> 00:44:44,792
You should be grateful

463
00:44:45,042 --> 00:44:46,126
Without me...

464
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:48,751
Prem wouldn't have married
a fat girl like you

465
00:44:48,792 --> 00:44:51,417
As if Prem was some movie star

466
00:44:51,542 --> 00:44:53,167
If you made him marry me...

467
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:56,376
...you should've taught him
how to treat me

468
00:44:57,376 --> 00:44:58,542
Listen to her!

469
00:44:59,792 --> 00:45:01,667
I was married too

470
00:45:01,792 --> 00:45:05,792
I ran a house, but I never
answered back

471
00:45:07,501 --> 00:45:09,417
Don't talk to your elders like that

472
00:45:10,251 --> 00:45:13,667
No one cares about me. They only
think of themselves

473
00:45:14,417 --> 00:45:16,542
- What is it?
- Ask your dear aunt

474
00:45:19,292 --> 00:45:20,917
Where are you going?

475
00:45:24,292 --> 00:45:26,167
Just ask me to unpack

476
00:45:29,876 --> 00:45:31,417
Why did you marry me?

477
00:45:33,292 --> 00:45:35,876
Get my clothes. I'm late

478
00:45:36,251 --> 00:45:38,667
Here. I'm late

479
00:47:34,917 --> 00:47:36,792
Greetings

480
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:39,917
- Raghubir, what brings you here?
- For you

481
00:47:40,001 --> 00:47:41,876
- What is it?
- Sweets

482
00:47:41,917 --> 00:47:44,667
And an invite

483
00:47:44,792 --> 00:47:46,001
A wedding invite?

484
00:47:46,376 --> 00:47:48,126
Nirmal's wedding?

485
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:52,126
Congratulations!
Listen, everybody. Prem

486
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:56,417
They met at college? So that's
what they teach nowadays

487
00:47:57,126 --> 00:47:59,376
She's a dentist

488
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:02,917
Prem got left behind because
of English. Otherwise...

489
00:48:03,042 --> 00:48:05,417
Stop it! Call Sandhya

490
00:48:05,501 --> 00:48:09,001
She is busy. Why call her?

491
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:13,792
I called out for you

492
00:48:14,667 --> 00:48:17,417
But Prem took you away

493
00:48:19,917 --> 00:48:22,292
You must come to my party

494
00:48:23,042 --> 00:48:24,001
Ok

495
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:25,542
Saying okay won't do

496
00:48:26,126 --> 00:48:29,376
Sandhya, he won't listen to me,
so...

497
00:48:29,417 --> 00:48:32,542
...grab him by his ears
and bring him there

498
00:48:33,042 --> 00:48:35,376
Have your tea. It's getting cold

499
00:48:51,042 --> 00:48:52,542
I told my father-in-law...

500
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:56,792
...to hire a community centre.
We'll have 500 guests or more

501
00:48:56,917 --> 00:49:00,042
A 21-gun salute for my family

502
00:49:00,126 --> 00:49:03,167
They agreed. Their gift.
Made in Japan

503
00:49:03,251 --> 00:49:05,167
Amazing sound

504
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:07,501
What song do you want hear?

505
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:10,542
- Any song
- Which song?

506
00:49:10,626 --> 00:49:13,292
I am a cut from the
old matrimonial school

507
00:49:13,626 --> 00:49:16,917
Prem is the new generation

508
00:49:17,001 --> 00:49:21,042
I fancy matrimony, but my
girl's father doesn't fancy me

509
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:25,376
Our Youth Club leader said
we must avoid domesticity

510
00:49:25,751 --> 00:49:28,417
Why think now? You're halfway there

511
00:49:28,917 --> 00:49:31,667
Marrying Deepti is not wrong

512
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:34,167
Show her photograph to Prem

513
00:49:36,292 --> 00:49:39,417
That's Deepti. Fresh as a rose

514
00:49:42,251 --> 00:49:44,917
Anyway, tell me how's married life?

515
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:47,292
Can't you tell?

516
00:49:53,376 --> 00:49:57,542
- If Sandhya sees you drinking...
- She can go to hell

517
00:49:57,626 --> 00:50:00,876
Prem, you're drunk.
Give me your glass

518
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:02,292
Sir, I respect you...

519
00:50:02,876 --> 00:50:05,542
I listen to your advice. Don't
say anything now

520
00:50:07,417 --> 00:50:09,167
Leave me alone

521
00:50:10,126 --> 00:50:13,167
My father ruined my life.
I stood no chance

522
00:50:13,417 --> 00:50:16,167
None of you help me one bit

523
00:50:16,417 --> 00:50:18,542
Control yourself, Prem

524
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:21,417
Nirmal, my friend.
You got it right

525
00:50:22,126 --> 00:50:26,626
You worked hard. You're
a gentleman. I'm illiterate

526
00:50:27,042 --> 00:50:29,417
And your Deepti - she's perfect

527
00:50:30,251 --> 00:50:32,417
- She'll make you happy
- I know

528
00:50:32,917 --> 00:50:35,792
No one asked if I wanted a life
like this

529
00:50:36,542 --> 00:50:41,667
Papa hitched me up. We're like
oxen under a plough

530
00:50:42,251 --> 00:50:43,917
Wait, Prem

531
00:50:47,876 --> 00:50:50,792
Sandhya is a good girl.
Looks aren't everything

532
00:50:50,876 --> 00:50:53,751
Then why show me
Deepti's photograph?

533
00:50:53,792 --> 00:50:55,417
Why do you love Suman?

534
00:50:55,542 --> 00:50:57,292
You're like my brother

535
00:50:57,376 --> 00:50:58,501
Drop it!

536
00:50:58,542 --> 00:51:02,667
She's so fat. I don't feel
like touching her

537
00:51:05,126 --> 00:51:08,126
Sleep with Sandhya one night...

538
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:09,917
...you'll know what hell is

539
00:52:20,501 --> 00:52:22,251
Stop him!

540
00:52:22,292 --> 00:52:24,126
I'll kill him

541
00:52:24,917 --> 00:52:27,876
You hit me

542
00:52:36,917 --> 00:52:40,292
I hit my sister, thanks to you

543
00:52:41,917 --> 00:52:43,667
Stop him

544
00:52:45,417 --> 00:52:46,501
Where to?

545
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:50,167
Let's sit down
and sort things out

546
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:53,417
Papa has hit him enough

547
00:52:53,542 --> 00:52:56,126
Prem's father knows what's best
for him

548
00:53:02,001 --> 00:53:06,001
- Take my shoe and beat him
- Never mind, Papa

549
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:09,042
It's not his fault. It's yours

550
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:14,042
You should've helped him study,
instead of getting him married

551
00:53:15,251 --> 00:53:16,417
Don't go

552
00:54:08,042 --> 00:54:10,917
What are you doing?

553
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:13,126
Tell me, will you?

554
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,792
You gave my room to Samar

555
00:54:14,792 --> 00:54:18,167
No phone. No letter.
How come you're back?

556
00:54:18,792 --> 00:54:21,126
I've left Prem. No more questions

557
00:54:21,167 --> 00:54:23,417
Left him? Are you crazy?

558
00:54:25,542 --> 00:54:28,001
Did he hit you? I'll sort him out

559
00:54:28,042 --> 00:54:31,042
Look! She tore up my school files

560
00:54:31,126 --> 00:54:32,667
How will I get an A+?

561
00:54:33,501 --> 00:54:37,167
Don't eye my room! I'll fix you too

562
00:54:37,251 --> 00:54:39,876
Why are you waiting?
Call her in-laws

563
00:54:39,917 --> 00:54:42,917
- Ask her what happened
- Don't dare call them

564
00:54:43,001 --> 00:54:44,792
Over my dead body

565
00:54:44,917 --> 00:54:49,876
As if you were sparkling with life.
Why are you here?

566
00:54:50,292 --> 00:54:53,542
He does not need me.
I do not need him

567
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:56,292
He wanted a wife

568
00:54:57,167 --> 00:54:59,042
He has no manners

569
00:55:00,001 --> 00:55:02,292
He insulted me in front of
the whole neighborhood

570
00:55:02,876 --> 00:55:05,751
He called me a fat cow,
and other things, mother

571
00:55:05,792 --> 00:55:08,417
But you are a fat cow

572
00:55:09,417 --> 00:55:12,917
Men are men. They talk nonsense
when they're angry

573
00:55:13,001 --> 00:55:14,917
Why argue with him?

574
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:18,501
Even if he was rude, you're smart.
You should've kept mum

575
00:55:18,792 --> 00:55:22,126
Kept mum?
I gave him a tight slap

576
00:55:22,167 --> 00:55:25,126
He won't talk to a woman like that
for the rest of his life

577
00:55:25,167 --> 00:55:29,251
This is what too much education
does to a girl

578
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,042
No need for your tears, mother

579
00:55:31,167 --> 00:55:34,542
Nothing happened. I am intact

580
00:55:34,626 --> 00:55:36,167
Have some shame

581
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:39,126
Be modest in front of your father

582
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:40,292
Explain to her

583
00:55:40,792 --> 00:55:43,417
Listen, women have to...

584
00:55:43,542 --> 00:55:45,501
That's enough

585
00:55:47,626 --> 00:55:48,667
Please listen

586
00:55:59,042 --> 00:56:02,792
The warhorse Chetak galloped,
setting the earth on fire

587
00:56:03,042 --> 00:56:07,126
When Chetak rode into the battlefield,
the enemy was destroyed

588
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:10,792
Now it is time for you to run.
Fly with the wind

589
00:56:11,542 --> 00:56:12,667
Enough

590
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:15,417
Time is short and the task is hard

591
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:17,667
We have to win

592
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:18,626
Sure

593
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:21,001
Being sure will not make you win

594
00:56:21,042 --> 00:56:22,167
Sure

595
00:56:23,042 --> 00:56:23,792
Ok

596
00:56:23,917 --> 00:56:27,167
Use your brawn and brains
to win this race

597
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:28,126
How?

598
00:56:28,417 --> 00:56:29,876
Hop on, son

599
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:40,542
That's it

600
00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:44,167
This is how you'll win

601
00:56:44,251 --> 00:56:46,167
Son, get off now

602
00:56:50,292 --> 00:56:51,876
Start exercising

603
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,042
Why, sir?

604
00:56:55,292 --> 00:56:56,751
Are they avoiding me?

605
00:56:56,792 --> 00:57:02,792
Nothing of the sort. We're busy
preparing for the contest

606
00:57:03,542 --> 00:57:05,417
Am I not invited?

607
00:57:06,376 --> 00:57:08,792
We wanted to invite you but after
what happened

608
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:10,417
Yes, sure

609
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:14,042
You hypocrite. Lecturing me
and licking Nirmal's boots

610
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:17,792
Mind your language

611
00:57:17,917 --> 00:57:21,876
Just because my wife left me,
everyone is ignoring me

612
00:57:23,876 --> 00:57:25,542
Calm down. Let's talk

613
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:27,167
I know you people

614
00:57:27,292 --> 00:57:29,542
They're enjoying my predicament

615
00:57:29,876 --> 00:57:32,167
Stop talking nonsense

616
00:57:32,292 --> 00:57:33,917
Let go. I'll slap you

617
00:57:34,876 --> 00:57:35,917
You'll hit me?

618
00:57:36,042 --> 00:57:36,917
Scum

619
00:57:37,042 --> 00:57:40,792
- Showing me your pretty wife's photo
- Don't drag her into this

620
00:57:40,917 --> 00:57:42,251
I'll drown you

621
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,792
What's all this?

622
00:57:45,042 --> 00:57:45,626
Go

623
00:57:45,667 --> 00:57:47,667
He's upset. I'll talk to him

624
00:57:47,751 --> 00:57:49,542
I've had my eye on him

625
00:57:49,876 --> 00:57:51,792
No unruly boys here

626
00:57:52,251 --> 00:57:55,292
- He'll be ok
- Take him away

627
00:57:57,792 --> 00:57:59,167
Throw cold water on him

628
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:01,251
He's too hot-headed

629
00:58:05,667 --> 00:58:07,167
Aunty, you don't worry at all

630
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:08,667
These days the law is with women

631
00:58:08,792 --> 00:58:11,542
You should believe in yourself
and the power of women

632
00:58:11,667 --> 00:58:14,417
You know there are many amendments
favouring women these days

633
00:58:14,542 --> 00:58:16,376
Sandhya's case is super strong

634
00:58:16,792 --> 00:58:20,417
- Will they stay together?
- She's talking about divorce

635
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:23,042
- Then why is she smiling?
- Must she cry?

636
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,417
Water

637
00:58:27,292 --> 00:58:28,417
Move!

638
00:58:30,417 --> 00:58:34,626
Did you change your surname
on your passport, or...?

639
00:58:34,917 --> 00:58:36,001
No

640
00:58:36,042 --> 00:58:37,751
Did you give any dowry?

641
00:58:37,792 --> 00:58:40,376
Any TV, VCR, sofa scooter,
anything?

642
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:43,542
- Who is giving us a TV?
- She asks if we gave anything

643
00:58:43,626 --> 00:58:45,292
Let me talk

644
00:58:46,626 --> 00:58:49,501
We spent about 20,000

645
00:58:49,542 --> 00:58:51,667
Jewelry, clothes, etc

646
00:58:51,792 --> 00:58:54,126
Madam, we spent very little cash

647
00:58:54,167 --> 00:58:58,417
- Her jewelry is still with her mother
- In the bank locker

648
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:02,417
What about my humiliation?
Who pays for that?

649
00:59:02,542 --> 00:59:04,542
Sandhya, that's not how you speak to
your parents

650
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:06,876
They also want your good
Say sorry

651
00:59:06,917 --> 00:59:10,292
Stop stirring up my daughter.
We educated her

652
00:59:11,417 --> 00:59:12,667
She wants sister to apologise

653
00:59:12,792 --> 00:59:14,917
- To whom?
- To you, for being rude

654
00:59:15,542 --> 00:59:17,376
Sandhya, don't lose heart, ok?

655
00:59:17,417 --> 00:59:19,917
Just concentrate on your exams

656
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:23,417
Aunty, don't take tension

657
00:59:23,501 --> 00:59:25,501
Divorce is very cool these days

658
00:59:25,542 --> 00:59:28,042
It's the means to a happy life

659
00:59:28,792 --> 00:59:30,376
I did not study law

660
00:59:30,876 --> 00:59:34,251
But I know we had a happy marriage

661
00:59:35,126 --> 00:59:36,042
I am sure

662
00:59:36,876 --> 00:59:38,167
Come with me

663
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:44,917
Are you drunk?

664
00:59:45,917 --> 00:59:48,542
Don't be stupid.
Go, get your wife back

665
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:50,167
Like hell. I won't

666
00:59:51,126 --> 00:59:56,167
I'm won't be a loser anymore. I'll
make something of my life

667
00:59:57,917 --> 01:00:01,917
Good movie lines, that's how
film heroes talk

668
01:00:02,417 --> 01:00:06,251
People like us must live
connected to reality

669
01:00:06,626 --> 01:00:08,417
I'll re-sit my high school exam

670
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:10,792
I will not live with my gloomy family

671
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:14,792
Are you nuts? You're a married man

672
01:00:15,501 --> 01:00:19,417
Your wife will soon be a teacher and
you want to carry a school bag?

673
01:00:20,167 --> 01:00:21,251
Look at me

674
01:00:21,667 --> 01:00:26,417
Don't I dream of becoming an actor?
Look at the ham actors today

675
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:30,917
My father forced me to live here.
I'm wasting my life

676
01:00:33,917 --> 01:00:38,376
My only hope is that Suman's father
accepts me

677
01:00:38,417 --> 01:00:39,417
Then life is set

678
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:41,667
You love Suman, right?

679
01:00:42,626 --> 01:00:46,167
If her father marries her to someone
else, would you do nothing?

680
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:49,417
There's a big difference between
reality and the movies

681
01:00:50,292 --> 01:00:52,292
Do you know the truth of my life?

682
01:00:53,792 --> 01:00:54,876
"36B"

683
01:00:55,876 --> 01:00:59,042
"Sister, 36D. The elastic is strong
and long-lasting"

684
01:00:59,167 --> 01:01:02,917
Dog! Siding with my enemies.
I'm better off alone

685
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:09,292
Do as you please

686
01:01:34,042 --> 01:01:36,417
- Saraswati Coaching Centre?
- Yes

687
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:39,542
I want to re-sit the high school
exam

688
01:01:39,626 --> 01:01:42,001
Show me your certificates

689
01:01:47,917 --> 01:01:50,042
She's made bland food

690
01:01:50,126 --> 01:01:52,292
Don't interrupt.
Let me see the recipe

691
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:55,626
She'll make us sick, dieting

692
01:01:55,667 --> 01:02:00,251
I won't stop you. Eat what you like.
This is for me

693
01:02:01,292 --> 01:02:05,042
This is the last straw.
First she left her husband

694
01:02:05,126 --> 01:02:07,501
Now she's dividing the kitchen

695
01:02:07,542 --> 01:02:10,626
- What are you cooking?
- Poison. Want some?

696
01:02:11,126 --> 01:02:13,167
No. You go ahead

697
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:40,792
Papa?

698
01:03:42,542 --> 01:03:45,542
- A new CD shop is opening
- Whose shop is it?

699
01:03:47,667 --> 01:03:48,667
It's here

700
01:03:49,126 --> 01:03:52,251
- Isn't this Nirmal's shop?
- Let's see

701
01:03:54,292 --> 01:03:56,501
How can one market have two
recording shops?

702
01:03:57,126 --> 01:03:58,917
Is this Nirmal's shop?

703
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:00,251
Yes, it is

704
01:04:01,042 --> 01:04:02,917
When does it open?

705
01:04:03,292 --> 01:04:05,667
The opening ceremony is over

706
01:04:06,792 --> 01:04:07,917
We're in trouble

707
01:04:14,126 --> 01:04:17,792
What will happen to our business
if you open a music store, Nirmal?

708
01:04:19,376 --> 01:04:21,292
You have everything

709
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:24,417
A decent wife, too

710
01:04:24,751 --> 01:04:29,042
He misbehaved at the Youth Club.
I came because of my father

711
01:04:29,501 --> 01:04:31,667
Be polite, Nirmal

712
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:35,417
Don't act pious, Nirmal. It took you
no time to ruin us

713
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:39,126
Have pity. His wife dumped him

714
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,167
Not surprising

715
01:04:41,292 --> 01:04:45,042
You got him married to that hippo
against his will

716
01:04:46,001 --> 01:04:47,876
I'll break your head

717
01:04:48,167 --> 01:04:50,001
See how he behaves!

718
01:04:52,542 --> 01:04:55,917
- Think before you talk, sister
- What did I say?

719
01:04:58,167 --> 01:05:00,167
The shop is our bread and butter

720
01:05:02,167 --> 01:05:05,751
We are not here to do charity either

721
01:05:06,167 --> 01:05:09,417
You must be happy. Bankrupting others

722
01:05:09,792 --> 01:05:13,042
You're just jealous.
Jealous of our success

723
01:05:13,126 --> 01:05:15,667
Success? My foot!

724
01:05:15,876 --> 01:05:18,251
We know your father paid a bribe
to get you into college

725
01:05:19,501 --> 01:05:23,376
Who is stopping you from using
your brain cells?

726
01:05:23,417 --> 01:05:27,251
The only thing that's free is whining.
That's all you do

727
01:05:27,292 --> 01:05:29,542
Stop taunting me

728
01:05:33,542 --> 01:05:36,001
Have some cake first

729
01:05:36,042 --> 01:05:38,251
It's her birthday. Some respect

730
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:43,292
Happy birthday

731
01:05:44,917 --> 01:05:45,917
Happy birthday

732
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:49,917
I'll give you a chance to save
your shop

733
01:05:50,167 --> 01:05:52,167
Take part in the wife-carrying
contest

734
01:05:52,292 --> 01:05:54,917
Win and the shop is yours

735
01:05:55,042 --> 01:05:57,251
Nirmal, don't talk rubbish

736
01:05:57,292 --> 01:05:58,917
This is too much

737
01:05:59,917 --> 01:06:01,001
I'm serious

738
01:06:01,042 --> 01:06:03,917
You'll never learn.
Go, open your shop!

739
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:06,751
We have 15 years of experience
recording tapes

740
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:11,292
If I was married...

741
01:06:11,417 --> 01:06:15,042
- ...I'd take part in the contest
- Naina, keep quiet

742
01:06:15,417 --> 01:06:17,542
That's enough from them

743
01:06:17,751 --> 01:06:20,292
Take part in the
wife-carrying contest

744
01:06:20,417 --> 01:06:23,167
I will not. Let my father carry you

745
01:06:23,292 --> 01:06:25,292
You will carry your wife and run

746
01:06:25,417 --> 01:06:27,417
It's your birthday, but don't talk rot

747
01:06:27,542 --> 01:06:30,251
I have told him. He'll run

748
01:06:30,542 --> 01:06:32,542
- I won't
- Yes, you will

749
01:06:36,167 --> 01:06:37,501
Has she gone senile?

750
01:06:37,751 --> 01:06:40,417
Haven't we been humiliated enough?

751
01:06:41,792 --> 01:06:43,001
What's wrong?

752
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:45,167
Why is she lying down?

753
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:47,292
- She tripped
- How come?

754
01:06:47,542 --> 01:06:48,792
Are you ok?

755
01:06:49,667 --> 01:06:50,542
What's wrong?

756
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:54,542
The divorce notice

757
01:06:55,501 --> 01:06:56,917
The bet is off

758
01:06:58,626 --> 01:06:59,292
No

759
01:07:01,667 --> 01:07:03,876
Yes, we get it

760
01:07:09,251 --> 01:07:11,542
Hurry! The judge is leaving

761
01:07:11,626 --> 01:07:14,542
Hope I don't leave this world
before him

762
01:07:15,042 --> 01:07:15,917
What is it?

763
01:07:17,001 --> 01:07:18,417
I'll sit in front

764
01:07:22,792 --> 01:07:25,292
- What shall I do?
- Take my hand

765
01:07:27,542 --> 01:07:29,251
Push me

766
01:07:30,917 --> 01:07:33,501
Going to bring the girl back?

767
01:07:34,626 --> 01:07:37,501
You must wish us bad luck,
right?

768
01:07:39,292 --> 01:07:41,292
Drive carefully

769
01:07:45,417 --> 01:07:49,542
Sinister man. He curses everyone

770
01:07:50,292 --> 01:07:53,167
Your sister's husband went to
the mountains looking for God

771
01:07:53,417 --> 01:07:55,792
Pervin's husband is in jail

772
01:07:56,251 --> 01:07:58,792
The bra seller can't convince his girl

773
01:07:59,167 --> 01:08:01,792
And Prem has a divorce notice

774
01:08:02,126 --> 01:08:05,292
Chant in the name of your mother,
not God

775
01:08:05,792 --> 01:08:08,042
She keeps talking nonsense

776
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:13,292
What did I say wrong?

777
01:08:17,917 --> 01:08:19,917
There'll be lots of crying

778
01:08:20,042 --> 01:08:20,876
Stay calm

779
01:08:20,917 --> 01:08:23,626
So cry once and for all

780
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:25,001
I'm very proud of you, Sandhya

781
01:08:25,042 --> 01:08:28,001
Is everyone here getting divorced?

782
01:08:28,042 --> 01:08:31,292
- Is that right, Prem?
- It's a divorce court

783
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:33,792
Stop talking

784
01:08:34,542 --> 01:08:37,667
Is there anything I should know?

785
01:08:37,792 --> 01:08:42,001
- What's that?

786
01:08:43,376 --> 01:08:46,792
No need to beg Sandhya.
Papa will carry you and run

787
01:08:46,876 --> 01:08:48,792
No way

788
01:08:52,751 --> 01:08:56,376
Why is God punishing us?

789
01:08:58,542 --> 01:09:00,542
A disaster

790
01:09:00,876 --> 01:09:04,042
Don't cry. We're the guilty ones

791
01:09:04,917 --> 01:09:09,042
Who wants a "divorced" sign
outside their house?

792
01:09:09,501 --> 01:09:10,917
Look what happened to me

793
01:09:17,417 --> 01:09:20,501
Sandhya Varma, Prem Prakash
Tiwari. Divorce Petition

794
01:09:22,001 --> 01:09:25,917
Tiwari is accused of insulting
Sandhya Varma in public

795
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:28,167
Hurting her physically
and emotionally

796
01:09:28,417 --> 01:09:31,167
She asks the court to grant
her divorce

797
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:35,917
The Tiwaris must pay a divorce
settlement of 50,000 rupees

798
01:09:37,126 --> 01:09:40,792
But she filed for divorce.
Is it mutual consent?

799
01:09:41,417 --> 01:09:42,167
Yes

800
01:09:43,667 --> 01:09:44,917
Was it a love marriage?

801
01:09:45,167 --> 01:09:48,626
Just a marriage, no love

802
01:09:49,042 --> 01:09:50,751
Then why did you marry him?

803
01:09:52,542 --> 01:09:53,542
I liked him

804
01:09:54,126 --> 01:09:55,042
And you?

805
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:59,792
Financial pressure. Sandhya
would teach and earn

806
01:10:00,376 --> 01:10:03,917
Papa wanted a bride
who earned a salary

807
01:10:04,292 --> 01:10:05,542
So I agreed

808
01:10:06,292 --> 01:10:09,667
Anything happened -
kisses, intercourse, etc?

809
01:10:09,792 --> 01:10:14,167
- I won't discuss private matters
- He loves humiliating me in public

810
01:10:14,792 --> 01:10:18,167
- Hitting me made you proud?
- I am ashamed of that

811
01:10:18,626 --> 01:10:23,417
- You humiliated me
- As though you didn't do the same

812
01:10:23,667 --> 01:10:26,792
And what's this ridiculous
settlement demand?

813
01:10:26,917 --> 01:10:29,501
- Don't you know our situation?
- What about me?

814
01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:31,876
Did you think before slapping me?

815
01:10:33,792 --> 01:10:34,917
Quiet, please!

816
01:10:35,792 --> 01:10:37,626
Do the family members
want to say anything?

817
01:10:37,917 --> 01:10:40,417
Your Honour, what can I say?

818
01:10:40,501 --> 01:10:44,167
You're wise. Misunderstandings
are commonplace

819
01:10:44,417 --> 01:10:47,292
That doesn't mean separating.
Just come home

820
01:10:47,626 --> 01:10:50,792
Prem's father and I fought too

821
01:10:51,042 --> 01:10:53,876
Once I added extra salt
in his mother's food

822
01:10:54,042 --> 01:10:57,042
He hit me hard with his shoe.
But I didn't leave home

823
01:10:57,251 --> 01:11:00,667
Am I talking Greek? I'm asking her
to come back

824
01:11:00,876 --> 01:11:04,792
Do only men have the right to talk?
Must we just cook and clean?

825
01:11:04,876 --> 01:11:08,042
This is your chance. File a case
of domestic violence

826
01:11:10,042 --> 01:11:14,417
Discuss your emotional
matters outside the court

827
01:11:16,542 --> 01:11:22,042
As per the Marriage Act, the court
asks you to live together for 6 months

828
01:11:22,292 --> 01:11:25,542
If matters are not resolved by then...

829
01:11:25,917 --> 01:11:28,792
..the court will approve the
divorce papers

830
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:39,042
Sandhya, come back.
We're pleading with you

831
01:11:39,167 --> 01:11:41,042
I'll get my room back

832
01:11:41,292 --> 01:11:43,292
Forget the law. Just come back

833
01:11:43,501 --> 01:11:46,251
- Ask him to say sorry
- Prem, come here

834
01:11:46,542 --> 01:11:48,542
The one who slapped first,
apologises first

835
01:11:49,167 --> 01:11:51,792
Who insulted me in public?
Apologise!

836
01:11:51,917 --> 01:11:52,876
All right

837
01:11:53,792 --> 01:11:54,542
Sorry

838
01:11:58,042 --> 01:12:02,167
She's your new mother.
You'll look after her now

839
01:12:02,626 --> 01:12:04,001
Hold this

840
01:12:04,667 --> 01:12:06,042
Please come

841
01:12:07,042 --> 01:12:09,751
I'm already feeling better

842
01:12:11,001 --> 01:12:14,626
The time has come to carry
your personal load

843
01:12:14,667 --> 01:12:18,292
Right here in the heart of Rishikesh

844
01:12:19,542 --> 01:12:22,376
All husbands! Flex your muscles

845
01:12:22,626 --> 01:12:25,667
All wives, lose some weight

846
01:12:32,917 --> 01:12:37,126
The winner gets 10,000 rupees

847
01:12:44,501 --> 01:12:49,792
"Heave-ho, carry that load"
The wife carrying contest

848
01:13:20,126 --> 01:13:21,542
Can I say something?

849
01:13:22,792 --> 01:13:26,501
It's not "of" Monday.
It's "on" Monday

850
01:13:26,917 --> 01:13:29,667
And we say "in" August.
Not "on" August

851
01:13:29,876 --> 01:13:32,167
The preposition is used differently

852
01:13:32,917 --> 01:13:34,042
Why did you touch my book?

853
01:13:34,626 --> 01:13:35,751
I was just...

854
01:13:35,876 --> 01:13:39,126
But why? Don't show off
your education

855
01:13:39,876 --> 01:13:43,167
Ok. I know you're very smart.
I know nothing

856
01:13:43,667 --> 01:13:45,792
I'm a fool and uneducated

857
01:13:46,626 --> 01:13:48,917
But stop putting me down

858
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:51,667
Listen, bear with me

859
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:54,667
Better we accept the farce
happily

860
01:13:55,042 --> 01:13:56,126
I'll go in six months

861
01:13:56,292 --> 01:13:57,667
"In" and not "on"

862
01:14:11,751 --> 01:14:13,917
Leave this in room 12

863
01:14:14,292 --> 01:14:17,876
I am a student...
Roll Number 317

864
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:25,542
- Take a seat
- Thank you

865
01:15:09,792 --> 01:15:10,917
Dear Teacher...

866
01:15:12,042 --> 01:15:13,667
I am 25 years old

867
01:15:14,876 --> 01:15:18,917
This is my third attempt at
the English exam

868
01:15:20,001 --> 01:15:23,167
My father was right. I'm a loser

869
01:15:23,792 --> 01:15:27,792
My struggle to make something
of my life ends here

870
01:15:28,917 --> 01:15:31,167
If you feel any pity...

871
01:15:31,501 --> 01:15:35,501
...or this letter moves you,
or your eyes moisten...

872
01:15:35,917 --> 01:15:38,876
...or if you're unmoved and want
to throw away my letter

873
01:15:39,126 --> 01:15:40,667
Or give me a zero

874
01:15:41,001 --> 01:15:45,042
Remember you are zeroing
the fate of a family

875
01:16:07,792 --> 01:16:09,251
Today I accept...

876
01:16:09,751 --> 01:16:13,126
...that I have failed my family,
my wife...

877
01:16:13,542 --> 01:16:15,292
...and myself

878
01:16:16,501 --> 01:16:17,917
Prem Prakash

879
01:16:26,001 --> 01:16:27,417
Start serving

880
01:16:35,251 --> 01:16:38,042
Give Prem some of this tasty
steamed food

881
01:16:41,917 --> 01:16:46,751
Why the long face? Sandhya has
made a delicious meal

882
01:16:47,167 --> 01:16:48,626
We'll eat together

883
01:16:49,251 --> 01:16:52,876
- I am not hungry
- We've been waiting for you

884
01:16:53,292 --> 01:16:55,667
Papa closed the shop early today

885
01:16:56,792 --> 01:16:58,292
Have you already eaten?

886
01:16:59,542 --> 01:17:00,667
You're drunk?

887
01:17:00,917 --> 01:17:03,667
Freshen up. He is coming

888
01:17:05,751 --> 01:17:09,917
I must say boiled vegetables
taste delicious

889
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:12,876
Spices cause acidity

890
01:17:13,376 --> 01:17:16,001
Sandhya has made great food

891
01:17:16,667 --> 01:17:18,667
Lentil broth

892
01:17:19,376 --> 01:17:22,667
- It's really tasty
- I forgot to add carom seeds

893
01:17:22,792 --> 01:17:25,501
It'll taste even better tomorrow

894
01:17:25,542 --> 01:17:27,917
- It's fine
- Have more then

895
01:17:31,417 --> 01:17:35,417
Let Sandhya have the cottage cheese

896
01:17:35,542 --> 01:17:39,042
No, Papa. Let him have it

897
01:17:39,126 --> 01:17:40,251
Eat up

898
01:17:44,001 --> 01:17:48,376
I was thinking - Prem and
Sandhya should partake...

899
01:17:49,417 --> 01:17:52,001
...in the wife-carrying championship

900
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:53,667
Great idea

901
01:17:54,251 --> 01:17:55,376
No, Papa

902
01:17:55,626 --> 01:17:58,376
It's embarrassing. It's too strange

903
01:17:58,751 --> 01:18:00,292
What's strange about it?

904
01:18:00,667 --> 01:18:03,042
Prem's father carried me
and ran four times

905
01:18:04,792 --> 01:18:07,167
That's another thing we didn't win

906
01:18:08,292 --> 01:18:13,167
Prem is very keen to participate
in the contest. Right?

907
01:18:14,292 --> 01:18:18,001
Sure. Why do you think that
I brought her back?

908
01:18:19,501 --> 01:18:22,542
He's always had a sense
of humour

909
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:26,667
See that?

910
01:18:43,792 --> 01:18:47,542
Couldn't you have played along
and had your meal?

911
01:18:50,001 --> 01:18:51,792
I can't pretend

912
01:18:52,917 --> 01:18:55,292
You all know the tricks

913
01:18:56,626 --> 01:18:58,501
You must know me by now

914
01:18:59,042 --> 01:19:01,542
I know nothing of the world

915
01:19:02,042 --> 01:19:04,417
You must think I am blighted

916
01:19:05,417 --> 01:19:07,667
- Come here
- What are you doing?

917
01:19:11,501 --> 01:19:14,167
My family's affections are a sham.
Lies!

918
01:19:14,292 --> 01:19:16,501
They are eating what they prefer

919
01:19:16,917 --> 01:19:19,501
We were hungry

920
01:19:19,542 --> 01:19:22,917
It's my fault. I tricked her
into coming back

921
01:19:23,042 --> 01:19:26,001
She'd run the race, save our shop,
get a job too

922
01:19:26,042 --> 01:19:27,292
It's all my fault

923
01:19:27,417 --> 01:19:29,417
Let me end my life

924
01:19:30,167 --> 01:19:33,167
- What are you doing?
- I'll kill myself

925
01:19:37,126 --> 01:19:41,792
You've been sweet-talking Sandhya,
she doesn't care about us

926
01:19:41,917 --> 01:19:43,667
Where are the matches?

927
01:19:45,042 --> 01:19:48,792
Sandhya, diet or exercise...
makes no difference

928
01:19:49,917 --> 01:19:52,292
Someone will love you
as you are

929
01:19:52,417 --> 01:19:53,751
It's all a sham

930
01:19:54,626 --> 01:19:59,126
The whole neighborhood
can watch me burn

931
01:19:59,167 --> 01:20:01,626
Where are the matches?

932
01:20:03,042 --> 01:20:05,417
Prem Prakash Tiwari -
Roll No. 317

933
01:20:11,417 --> 01:20:12,417
What happened?

934
01:20:12,667 --> 01:20:15,792
Well, he wrote his English exam
in Hindi

935
01:20:18,251 --> 01:20:20,417
He had planned to commit suicide

936
01:20:22,167 --> 01:20:25,626
This is all family matters. It's ok

937
01:20:26,626 --> 01:20:30,792
Suicide? He couldn't even kill
a mosquito

938
01:22:11,167 --> 01:22:14,042
Did you really want to kill yourself?

939
01:22:16,792 --> 01:22:18,876
Did you really love me?

940
01:22:20,251 --> 01:22:22,292
You never gave me the chance

941
01:22:23,042 --> 01:22:26,292
To express myself or to feel

942
01:22:29,542 --> 01:22:31,917
I am unworthy of being loved

943
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:36,917
You know...

944
01:22:38,876 --> 01:22:41,167
I was very keen on marriage

945
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:45,542
But no one told me what
marriage really is

946
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:50,667
As if anyone told me. I was misled too

947
01:22:52,792 --> 01:22:54,876
Be smarter the next time

948
01:23:04,292 --> 01:23:08,001
Will you invite me to your wedding
if you found someone?

949
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:10,251
Who will marry me?

950
01:23:12,001 --> 01:23:13,792
I'll find you someone...

951
01:23:14,501 --> 01:23:18,292
...who loves and respects you,
cares for you

952
01:23:19,667 --> 01:23:22,042
That's what I thought you'd do

953
01:23:29,292 --> 01:23:30,126
Sorry

954
01:23:42,542 --> 01:23:43,667
It's all right

955
01:23:44,626 --> 01:23:49,042
I'll find you someone you are not
ashamed of

956
01:23:49,917 --> 01:23:52,376
Who doesn't brag about her education

957
01:23:53,542 --> 01:23:55,251
Where's a girl like that?

958
01:23:55,917 --> 01:23:58,542
As if there were dozens of suitors
for me

959
01:24:22,876 --> 01:24:25,501
Papa, let's sell the shop

960
01:24:26,917 --> 01:24:30,167
Your call. You wanted a music shop

961
01:24:31,751 --> 01:24:33,251
I'm off, aunt

962
01:24:37,042 --> 01:24:39,417
- Bless you
- Wait

963
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:42,167
I'm coming

964
01:24:52,126 --> 01:24:53,167
See that?

965
01:24:54,417 --> 01:24:58,667
They wanted you back
for their selfish reasons

966
01:25:00,501 --> 01:25:02,542
A team spirit is needed

967
01:25:03,917 --> 01:25:07,542
True. We aren't a team
nor are we as one

968
01:25:08,417 --> 01:25:09,542
Never mind

969
01:25:17,376 --> 01:25:18,251
Listen

970
01:25:19,417 --> 01:25:20,376
Best of luck

971
01:25:34,917 --> 01:25:35,917
Go straight

972
01:25:37,667 --> 01:25:38,792
Namaste

973
01:25:43,751 --> 01:25:45,001
Sandhya Varma?

974
01:25:45,626 --> 01:25:47,876
Documents, please

975
01:25:50,876 --> 01:25:54,167
My file? I had it with me

976
01:25:54,417 --> 01:25:58,042
You came for an interview
and forgot your papers?

977
01:25:58,126 --> 01:26:00,876
I can't understand. I had the file

978
01:26:02,667 --> 01:26:05,167
Can I come back tomorrow?

979
01:26:05,251 --> 01:26:08,667
The interview is for today,
not tomorrow

980
01:26:10,876 --> 01:26:12,167
Namaste

981
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:14,751
You forgot your file

982
01:26:16,792 --> 01:26:17,792
Your file

983
01:26:20,167 --> 01:26:20,917
Who is he?

984
01:26:22,542 --> 01:26:23,501
My husband

985
01:26:23,917 --> 01:26:25,417
Your husband?

986
01:26:27,167 --> 01:26:28,001
My papers

987
01:26:34,042 --> 01:26:35,501
Quite impressive

988
01:26:36,292 --> 01:26:37,876
Have you gone through them?

989
01:26:39,542 --> 01:26:41,001
We have no vacancy here

990
01:26:41,417 --> 01:26:43,251
But there's a job in Meerut

991
01:26:43,626 --> 01:26:47,417
If your family allows you,
you could work there

992
01:26:50,626 --> 01:26:53,251
I'll persuade them. Don't worry

993
01:26:53,626 --> 01:26:55,792
- Is it possible?
- Yes

994
01:27:03,001 --> 01:27:04,001
12 feet

995
01:27:05,917 --> 01:27:07,542
Business is bad

996
01:27:09,792 --> 01:27:12,792
I've been saying that for a while

997
01:27:13,251 --> 01:27:15,876
I know. Put the shop on sale
at once

998
01:27:16,792 --> 01:27:18,501
Inform us soon

999
01:27:26,917 --> 01:27:31,001
"Wife-carrying contest"

1000
01:28:19,501 --> 01:28:21,292
I've made your song tape

1001
01:28:22,667 --> 01:28:25,042
I've left the tape here

1002
01:28:34,251 --> 01:28:35,042
Welcome

1003
01:28:37,917 --> 01:28:39,917
Did you hear about the interview?

1004
01:28:41,167 --> 01:28:41,917
No

1005
01:28:43,292 --> 01:28:45,292
I'm sure you'll get the job

1006
01:28:45,917 --> 01:28:47,417
How do you know?

1007
01:28:49,917 --> 01:28:50,917
I just know

1008
01:28:56,001 --> 01:28:57,542
May I say something?

1009
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:01,167
You can leave whenever
you feel like

1010
01:29:01,626 --> 01:29:03,042
No one will stop you

1011
01:29:04,792 --> 01:29:06,917
My family is jinxed

1012
01:29:08,417 --> 01:29:11,501
There is no point suffering
on our account

1013
01:29:17,167 --> 01:29:18,626
Think about your future

1014
01:29:20,542 --> 01:29:21,542
Ok?

1015
01:29:29,751 --> 01:29:31,042
It'll turn out fine

1016
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:42,042
I have the job

1017
01:29:44,292 --> 01:29:45,167
In Meerut

1018
01:30:07,542 --> 01:30:09,167
So you've decided?

1019
01:30:12,876 --> 01:30:15,792
There's no one here to stay for

1020
01:30:19,042 --> 01:30:22,167
There are very few buses
to Meerut from here

1021
01:30:23,542 --> 01:30:28,126
If someone wants to see me,
they'll find a way

1022
01:30:31,417 --> 01:30:32,751
Have you lived alone?

1023
01:30:33,917 --> 01:30:34,667
No

1024
01:30:36,251 --> 01:30:38,751
Never had a broken marriage
either

1025
01:30:51,917 --> 01:30:55,167
I am Siddhesh, your husband's
brother

1026
01:30:59,167 --> 01:31:03,126
Yes? How come you thought
of me after so many years?

1027
01:31:05,376 --> 01:31:09,542
Sister-in-law? Sorry, I didn't
recognise your voice. Bad news

1028
01:31:09,917 --> 01:31:12,251
Your husband has died

1029
01:31:13,542 --> 01:31:17,542
He went to the Himalayas on
a pilgrimage. He died in a landslide

1030
01:31:17,917 --> 01:31:20,542
He died the day he left me,
15 years ago

1031
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:23,667
Can you come for his last rites?

1032
01:31:23,917 --> 01:31:27,042
What connection do I have
with your family anymore?

1033
01:31:27,376 --> 01:31:30,917
Did he ever call or write to ask
if I was dead or alive

1034
01:31:31,376 --> 01:31:34,292
I thought I should at least inform you

1035
01:31:35,167 --> 01:31:36,667
Who was it?

1036
01:31:38,376 --> 01:31:39,626
Siddhesh

1037
01:31:41,167 --> 01:31:42,542
What did he say?

1038
01:31:48,667 --> 01:31:50,876
I am a widow

1039
01:31:52,292 --> 01:31:55,042
I've been a widow for years anyway

1040
01:31:57,542 --> 01:31:58,542
Meaning?

1041
01:32:00,667 --> 01:32:02,042
Greetings, uncle

1042
01:32:06,292 --> 01:32:07,292
Where's Prem?

1043
01:32:08,792 --> 01:32:10,542
Are you ready for the race?

1044
01:32:11,042 --> 01:32:14,126
As long as you race when you
carry my funeral pyre

1045
01:32:14,917 --> 01:32:16,292
What's wrong?

1046
01:32:20,542 --> 01:32:22,626
That's enough

1047
01:32:24,042 --> 01:32:24,792
Come

1048
01:32:29,792 --> 01:32:31,417
Can I come in?

1049
01:32:32,042 --> 01:32:33,667
The door's unlocked

1050
01:32:44,667 --> 01:32:47,001
Vijay came to take you for the race

1051
01:32:47,417 --> 01:32:48,917
Your Papa told him to go

1052
01:32:55,751 --> 01:32:58,417
Look, I never got a chance...

1053
01:33:00,167 --> 01:33:02,042
...to be a wife

1054
01:33:02,167 --> 01:33:05,542
To have a family.
I've just lived as a widow

1055
01:33:11,667 --> 01:33:15,792
This is your time. You both
should make the most of it

1056
01:33:17,542 --> 01:33:19,917
No one is running in that race

1057
01:33:20,667 --> 01:33:22,417
What's the use?

1058
01:33:22,792 --> 01:33:26,917
Thinking of what's useful has done
nothing for us

1059
01:33:27,667 --> 01:33:32,126
Doesn't matter if you win or lose.
Do it for yourselves

1060
01:33:32,417 --> 01:33:35,001
Forcing never achieved anything

1061
01:33:35,751 --> 01:33:37,501
He doesn't want to

1062
01:33:37,542 --> 01:33:39,417
As if you do

1063
01:33:40,167 --> 01:33:43,292
Why ask if you don't want to race?

1064
01:33:44,376 --> 01:33:46,792
Haven't we lost enough face
in the town?

1065
01:33:47,417 --> 01:33:49,542
We've lost everything

1066
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:52,626
Nothing left to mock

1067
01:33:53,042 --> 01:33:54,751
If there's nothing to lose...

1068
01:33:54,792 --> 01:33:56,917
...then why not run for yourselves?

1069
01:34:00,501 --> 01:34:02,126
Can't you carry me?

1070
01:34:05,542 --> 01:34:06,876
Of course I can

1071
01:34:08,001 --> 01:34:10,542
I didn't go to the Youth Club
for nothing

1072
01:34:15,542 --> 01:34:18,001
Shall I ask your mother
to phone your sisters?

1073
01:34:20,126 --> 01:34:21,292
Why not?

1074
01:34:42,292 --> 01:34:46,792
"Heave-ho, carry that load!"

1075
01:35:27,001 --> 01:35:28,292
I'll be back

1076
01:35:33,251 --> 01:35:34,542
You're here!

1077
01:35:37,667 --> 01:35:39,001
I've signed you on

1078
01:35:43,417 --> 01:35:45,917
Our honour is in your hands

1079
01:35:47,626 --> 01:35:48,667
God bless

1080
01:35:51,792 --> 01:35:53,792
Make sure you win

1081
01:35:54,542 --> 01:35:57,792
Don't pressure us. It's enough
that we're running

1082
01:35:58,001 --> 01:36:00,042
Why are you negative?

1083
01:36:14,292 --> 01:36:15,417
Look who is here

1084
01:36:17,917 --> 01:36:21,667
Can you carry her, Prem? Or do you
need your Papa's help?

1085
01:36:22,292 --> 01:36:23,167
Well, sir?

1086
01:36:26,917 --> 01:36:29,501
- What are you doing here?
- To hell with...

1087
01:36:30,001 --> 01:36:31,792
...my father and her father too

1088
01:36:32,042 --> 01:36:34,167
We got married this morning

1089
01:36:34,792 --> 01:36:35,542
Well done!

1090
01:36:39,292 --> 01:36:40,751
Brothers and sisters

1091
01:36:41,126 --> 01:36:44,917
The time has come to shoulder the
responsibilities of marriage

1092
01:36:45,292 --> 01:36:48,792
Let's see who makes it to the end

1093
01:36:49,001 --> 01:36:51,751
You'll face many obstacles

1094
01:36:57,417 --> 01:37:00,042
Who will win 10,000 rupees?

1095
01:37:00,167 --> 01:37:04,292
To inaugurate this race
we have with us the voice...

1096
01:37:06,792 --> 01:37:09,917
...that has captured
the heart of millions

1097
01:37:45,251 --> 01:37:52,542
I request Kumar Sanu to ring
the bell and start the race

1098
01:37:53,626 --> 01:37:55,167
One...

1099
01:38:20,792 --> 01:38:23,792
Run, Prem Prakash Tiwari!

1100
01:38:41,126 --> 01:38:45,042
Open your eyes, tie your shoelaces

1101
01:38:45,167 --> 01:38:49,042
Fire your breath like a bullet

1102
01:38:59,126 --> 01:39:01,042
Be careful

1103
01:39:01,876 --> 01:39:04,251
Both feet in one tyre, then the next

1104
01:39:04,417 --> 01:39:05,626
It's not easy

1105
01:39:05,917 --> 01:39:08,251
If you were in my place you'd know

1106
01:39:08,792 --> 01:39:10,042
Hold tight

1107
01:39:20,626 --> 01:39:23,126
I knew the Youth Club leader
was a fraud

1108
01:39:23,167 --> 01:39:25,751
The flying horse was no help

1109
01:39:30,126 --> 01:39:32,667
Prem Tiwari and Sandhya Varma...

1110
01:39:32,751 --> 01:39:35,626
...are advancing slowly

1111
01:39:39,542 --> 01:39:41,626
You look good together

1112
01:39:42,042 --> 01:39:44,417
- You too
- Can you talk later?

1113
01:39:45,042 --> 01:39:46,292
You never learn

1114
01:39:53,042 --> 01:39:57,251
Run like a true man,
kick up a dust storm

1115
01:39:57,917 --> 01:39:59,292
Will you make it?

1116
01:40:01,292 --> 01:40:02,917
Aren't I doing ok?

1117
01:40:03,542 --> 01:40:06,792
- Don't let go
- I won't. Look ahead

1118
01:40:13,042 --> 01:40:17,042
Scale all walls, cross all rivers

1119
01:40:23,417 --> 01:40:25,542
- What's wrong?
- It tickles

1120
01:40:26,042 --> 01:40:27,417
Ok?

1121
01:40:53,542 --> 01:40:54,667
Are you ok?

1122
01:40:55,792 --> 01:40:57,792
Deepti

1123
01:40:58,792 --> 01:41:01,001
- Here
- I'm hurt

1124
01:41:01,042 --> 01:41:02,417
You crazy?

1125
01:41:03,251 --> 01:41:06,167
- Hurry
- What the hell?

1126
01:41:10,417 --> 01:41:11,501
What happened?

1127
01:41:13,001 --> 01:41:15,792
- What's so funny?
- Just look at you face

1128
01:41:17,001 --> 01:41:18,917
As if you looked lovely

1129
01:41:25,042 --> 01:41:29,001
If people are jealous, so what?
No need of modesty

1130
01:41:29,042 --> 01:41:33,126
If anyone tries to sneak away,
show him up

1131
01:41:33,167 --> 01:41:37,292
The thing that knows no end,
soak forever in that madness

1132
01:41:58,876 --> 01:42:03,042
The ground trembles
wherever your foot treads

1133
01:42:29,126 --> 01:42:32,917
I don't want to leave.
Keep me with you

1134
01:43:20,042 --> 01:43:23,292
There! The winners
of this year's contest...

1135
01:43:23,417 --> 01:43:26,292
...Prem and Sandhya

1136
01:43:28,042 --> 01:43:30,042
Looks like they're not done yet

1137
01:43:50,292 --> 01:43:54,667
My heart was never as carefree
as now

1138
01:44:06,626 --> 01:44:08,417
Like a letter...

1139
01:44:08,501 --> 01:44:12,792
...that found a new address

1140
01:44:21,542 --> 01:44:24,042
We walk on empty roads

1141
01:44:24,626 --> 01:44:27,876
With our eyes closed

1142
01:44:27,917 --> 01:44:32,292
Ending up in a faraway place.
Aimlessly

1143
01:44:36,042 --> 01:44:39,792
The threads of endearment...

1144
01:44:39,917 --> 01:44:43,626
...are entangled in your fingers

1145
01:44:43,667 --> 01:44:47,792
I cannot find a way...

1146
01:44:47,917 --> 01:44:52,001
...to untie the knot

1147
01:45:27,501 --> 01:45:30,292
I don't care about my tears

1148
01:45:31,542 --> 01:45:34,667
But there is someone whose
tears I cannot see

1149
01:45:36,292 --> 01:45:37,376
Sandhya

1150
01:45:40,792 --> 01:45:44,667
Now you will see a song
composed by Anu Malik

1151
01:45:45,292 --> 01:45:46,876
Lyrics by Varun Grover

1152
01:45:46,917 --> 01:45:50,001
Sung by Sadhana Sargam and
Kumar Sanu
