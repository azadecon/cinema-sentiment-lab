1
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:24,810
The jury finds Mr. Aakash Rana
guilty on all accounts.

2
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,090
I just want to present my
side of the story to the court.

3
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,490
His hindu marriage with British
nationalist Mrs. Nikita Malhotra

4
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,780
...is considered illegal
according to the laws of England.

5
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,300
Our marriage is not illegal.

6
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:43,400
The court orders to seize Mr. Aakash
Rana's assets and bank accounts.

7
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,090
But my visa is valid. And
I am married to a British citizen.

8
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,890
After hearing the appeal
of the UK border agency...

9
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,770
...the court orders to deport
Mr. Aakash Rana immediately.

10
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,130
We are not criminals.

11
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,420
And bars him from
returning to UK ever again.

12
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,010
See, I am not a criminal.

13
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,060
I want to take my wife along.

14
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,750
I want justice.

15
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,810
Hi.

16
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,760
Good to see you, sir.

17
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,020
How are you?

18
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,590
Still alive, sir.

19
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,900
But we faced really terrible
days since you left.

20
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,830
Did you get any news?

21
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,330
I've been looking for
it since a long time, sir.

22
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,180
God willing, we'll soon succeed.

23
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,780
Taxi!

24
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,210
This is a garage?

25
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,730
A garage of stolen vehicles.

26
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,210
They don't come here to
get repaired, but disappear.

27
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,580
Steal a car from a
posh locality in London.

28
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,300
Remove the parts and
sell them in the gray market.

29
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,570
All in two hours.

30
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,010
Hey.

31
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,290
Hey.
- Jojo.

32
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,070
You?

33
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,380
Aadil.

34
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,720
Come on.
- Wait here for a moment.

35
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,230
Who is he?

36
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,790
He's with me.

37
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,870
Do you have the packages?

38
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,710
Show me the money.
- Package first.

39
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,030
Show me the money.

40
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,670
Show me the stuff.

41
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Show me the money.

42
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,020
Show me the stuff.

43
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,170
That's one hell lot
of C4s you got here, boys.

44
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,830
That shit could
blow London sky high.

45
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,240
What's the idea?

46
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,270
You'll know soon.

47
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,170
Come on, man. Run.

48
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,150
Run. Run.

49
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,760
Cops. Run.

50
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,110
You brought a cop.

51
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,590
He's not a cop.
- Move.

52
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,820
Move. Move.

53
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Down.

54
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,840
Team One, move in there.

55
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,400
Team Two, move in there.

56
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,940
Move! Move!

57
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,760
Move it!

58
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,970
Let's all go down.

59
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,140
Move.
- Move.

60
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,570
Team One, move.

61
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
Team One, move.

62
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,480
He's also down.

63
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,200
Move. Move. Watch it. Watch it.

64
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,750
Aadil run.

65
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,960
"Come on,
everybody, do you want to play?"

66
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,140
"Do you want to get hot?
Do you want to get wet?"

67
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,710
"At night if you have...
- Laila. Laila."

68
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,320
"If you have the company of...
- Laila. Laila."

69
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,940
"In your arms just...
- Laila. Laila."

70
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,870
"I can make Majnu go crazy."

71
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,960
"I am Laila. I am Laila."

72
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,850
"I am Laila. I am Laila."

73
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,260
"I am Laila. I am Laila."

74
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,870
"I am Laila.
Everybody's beloved Laila."

75
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,510
"I am Laila. I am Laila."

76
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,650
"I am Laila.
Everybody's beloved Laila."

77
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,010
"At night if you have...
- Laila. Laila."

78
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,770
"If you have the company of
- Laila. Laila."

79
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,350
"In your arms just...
- Laila. Laila."

80
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,300
"I can make Majnu go crazy."

81
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,640
"I am the talk of the town."

82
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:13,780
"I rule everyone's
dreams without a crown."

83
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,590
"If you spend a night with me."

84
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,070
"On fire your body will be."

85
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,870
"You'll never be
able to forget me."

86
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,150
"I can make Majnu go crazy."

87
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,750
"Put up your hand in
the air and say Laila."

88
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,590
"Everybody say La momma Laila."

89
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,790
"She's a Laila."

90
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,170
"Where's a Laila?"

91
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,930
"Come on, my Laila.

92
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,020
"Every Friday I apply
kohl in my eyes."

93
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,420
"In a party when I look up..."

94
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,200
"Everybody if you see her.

95
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,350
"Tell me what you see."

96
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,770
"I want to shake your body."

97
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,890
"Start it again."

98
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,930
"Every Friday I apply
kohl in my eyes."

99
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:28,610
"In a party when I look up..."

100
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,390
"16 to 55,
no matter what's the age."

101
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,770
"To get me,
everyone has just one craze."

102
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,810
"Looking at me,
hearts beat faster in rage."

103
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,420
"I can make Majnu go crazy."

104
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,540
"Laila. Laila."

105
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,090
"I am Laila.
Everybody's beloved Laila."

106
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,780
"I am Laila. I am Laila."

107
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,980
"I am Laila. I am Laila."

108
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,980
"I am..."

109
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,580
"At night if you have...
- Laila. Laila."

110
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,170
"If you have the company of...
- Laila. Laila."

111
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,840
"In your arms just...
- Laila. Laila."

112
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,310
"I can make Majnu go crazy."

113
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,150
We're closed.
- Steve, they're with me.

114
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,020
So far whatever you
did for was for us.

115
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,540
Now it's our turn.

116
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,620
Nowadays,
you don't get respect easily.

117
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,370
You have to snatch it.

118
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,500
I hope we'll get
our share by tomorrow.

119
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:27,110
He's a combination of
a statesman and a film star.

120
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,160
He's companionate,
enthusiastic, humorous...

121
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,010
...and has a strong
sense of public duty.

122
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,230
That my friends, is Arjun Khanna.

123
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,770
Arjun, I personally feel that
you've decided to retire too early.

124
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,070
It is truly a loss for us, Arjun.

125
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,870
You'll be surely missed
by us and our community.

126
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,840
To Arjun Khanna,
policeman extraordinaire.

127
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,760
Thank you.

128
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,230
Thank you, Levi.

129
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,650
Thank you for saying such
wonderful things about me.

130
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,180
Now, can I have a copy
of the speech, for my in-laws?

131
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,010
In my entire life,
I've realized that...

132
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,730
...there are three things
you should never try to do.

133
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,870
First, never try to kiss
a girl leaning away from you.

134
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,860
Second, never climb a
friend leaning towards you.

135
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,620
And third, never try to
keep such a wonderful gathering...

136
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,930
...away from drinks and fine dine.

137
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,790
So, ladies and gentlemen,
please join me in my memories.

138
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,920
Let's party.

139
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,700
Yeah!

140
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,080
Packed your books?
- Yes.

141
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,360
All of them?
- Yes, of course.

142
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,110
Packed your lunch?
- Yes, Daddy.

143
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,300
Make sure you have it.
Did you call your mother?

144
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,150
Yes.
- What is the pickup time?

145
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,970
I have done it!
Where is your ticket?

146
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,520
Daddy, don't worry.
I'm a big girl now.

147
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,890
I am all grown up now.

148
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,000
Okay, big girl,
I've a surprise for you.

149
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,280
Surprise?

150
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
Wow.

151
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,360
A new cell phone.

152
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,560
Thank you, Daddy.
- Here's the charger.

153
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,530
Thank you.

154
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:43,970
I have added all the contacts.

155
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,700
Just in case. Okay?

156
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:52,990
Bye, Daddy.

157
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,150
I love you.
- I love you, too.

158
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,900
Go. Go. Go.
- Bye. Yeah.

159
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,780
If you could tell Suzan
to mail final presentations, too.

160
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,280
Come on.

161
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,380
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

162
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,320
This is your co-driver,
Sean Sadler...

163
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,490
...welcoming you to
112 Virgin Train service.

164
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,620
It's this one, sir.
- Thank you.

165
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,090
On our journey today
we will calling at Wigan...

166
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,980
I'm late. Don't say it.

167
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,480
Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

168
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,110
Morning.
- Good morning.

169
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,240
Morning, Rita.

170
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,060
Morning, Leno.

171
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,090
The forces tell me it's
time for me to go home to sleep.

172
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,380
Any updates?

173
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,420
I had a problem on
a train that had stalled...

174
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,930
...under Southampton country line.

175
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,070
I had to diverse some
passengers via Northampton.

176
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,740
Good morning,
Railway control security.

177
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,820
May I help you, please?

178
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,540
Just a moment.

179
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,710
Hello, this is the Railway
Security Chief speaking.

180
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:01,800
Hello.

181
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,220
There's a bomb on
London-Glasgow 112.

182
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,110
If the speed drops
below 60 the bomb explodes.

183
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,580
Do not stop the train.

184
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,610
Do not stop the train.

185
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,620
Excuse me, sir.
- Yeah?

186
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,300
You are needed inside, urgently.

187
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,120
Yeah. Thanks fine.

188
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,460
Hi, guys.
- Good morning.

189
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,090
Hello, sir.
- Hey, Radhika.

190
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,350
How is your cold?
- Absolutely fine, sir.

191
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,430
We've a situation.

192
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
Okay.

193
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,730
Good morning, gentlemen.
So, what's happened?

194
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,760
There's a bomb threat.
- Trigger station?

195
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,500
London-Glasgow.
Train 112.

196
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,570
Did you say the
London-Glasgow express?

197
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,080
Radhika,
there's a bomb threat on 112.

198
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,050
The bomb can explode
if its speed goes below 60.

199
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,220
Perhaps someone is playing a prank.
But I'm not taking any chances.

200
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,300
What?

201
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,700
Okay, listen up, everyone. Guys.

202
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,650
Guys. Guys. Come on, listen up.

203
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,910
There's a bomb threat on
London-Glasgow Express, No. 112.

204
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,300
I want each and every
one of you to concentrate.

205
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,130
Radhika, keep the track
of 112 clear. - Yes.

206
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,490
John, get me the
driver on the line.

207
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,430
Sir. You're needed inside,
urgently.

208
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,650
I told you there's
a bomb on the train.

209
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,380
If you think it's a hoax then...

210
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,780
You...

211
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,310
Give me the phone.

212
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,940
Hello. Hello.

213
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,140
Just rewind. Quickly.

214
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,490
Stop. Play.

215
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,870
'It's a hoax then... '

216
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,130
'You... '

217
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,790
Hello. He's on line.

218
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,390
Who are you?

219
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,210
I just heard you abuse.

220
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,060
What do you want?

221
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,110
Who are you?

222
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,520
My name is Sanjay Raina.

223
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,140
Railway Traffic Controller.

224
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,800
My name isn't more important
than 500 passengers' lives.

225
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,540
But your good sense
could save their lives.

226
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,210
Hence, listen carefully.

227
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,820
If you this is a hoax then
I have planted a similar bomb...

228
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,200
...on London Manchester
Goods Train 509.

229
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,960
It is currently running
at the speed of 15m/hr.

230
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,460
In a while the train will ascend.

231
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,500
While ascending its speed
will reduce by 5 miles.

232
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,530
And the bomb will explode.

233
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,190
If you want to save the drivers...

234
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,150
...then they should jump
off it before the bomb explodes.

235
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,740
Hello.

236
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,310
A bomb. Come on, jump.

237
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,820
All the exchange points
that I am concerned about...

238
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,070
Sir, he hasn't lied.

239
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,930
Goods train just blew off.
There was a bomb on that train.

240
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,380
What about the drivers?

241
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,190
Sir, they jumped off
before the bomb exploded.

242
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,680
But there were minor injuries.

243
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,410
Find out the exact position
and speed of the train.

244
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,590
Right, sir.
- Fast.

245
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,120
And John, I want the position

246
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,770
of all the trains coming
in the opposite direction.

247
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,040
Bring it over.
- Yes, sir.

248
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,890
Sir, it has just crossed
Chelsea on the North Line.

249
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,390
And the speed is 90m/hr.

250
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,750
Good. Ask the driver
to maintain the speed...

251
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,870
...and not to reduce it at
any cost, unless I say so. - Sir.

252
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,050
John, inform all stations, 112
will not be making scheduled stops.

253
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,130
Okay, sir.

254
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,460
Radhika, check all lines,
crossings and signals.

255
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,940
There shouldn't be any
obstructions on the track.

256
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,020
Right, sir.

257
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,190
Hi, sir. It's Richard speaking.

258
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,870
Sir, I've got the
train driver on the line.

259
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,810
What's his name, John?

260
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,710
Give me the headphones.
- Richard. - Richard.

261
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,140
Richard.
- Sir.

262
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,000
We have reason to believe
there is a bomb on your train.

263
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,580
We have no official
confirmation yet.

264
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,600
But we are not taking
any chances, Richard.

265
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,600
Richard. Richard.

266
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,250
Richard, get a hold of yourself
and listen to me very carefully.

267
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,340
What is your speed right now?

268
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,330
110 miles per hour, sir.

269
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,820
We should be reaching
our next station in 20 minutes.

270
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,440
We could stop and do checks there.

271
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,050
No. No. No. No. No, Richard.
You'll do nothing of that sort.

272
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,180
If you reduce your speed to less
than 60m/hr the bomb will go off.

273
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,310
Do you hear me?

274
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,920
Radhika, how long will it take
to reach Glasgow at this speed?

275
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,100
Sir, approximately 10 hours.

276
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,910
Okay, Richard, now concentrate.

277
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,700
You bring your
speed down to 70m/hr.

278
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,570
That will make your journey
to Glasgow to about 12 hours.

279
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,790
Wish you luck.
- Sanjay.

280
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
Sanjay.

281
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,800
This is Sanjay Raina.
Our head traffic controller.

282
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,490
Detective inspector Allen fisher.

283
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,180
Senior investigative officer.

284
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,020
Good morning.

285
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,940
Has the bomber called again?
- No, not yet.

286
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,390
Well, he might.
So, we need to be prepared.

287
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,470
Where's the control room?
- It's this way, sir.

288
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,950
Sir, sir. Excuse me, sir.

289
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,520
Can I have a quiet word?

290
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,590
Sir, we've an emergency situation.

291
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,590
And this is an emergency
joining call for you.

292
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,490
When we go to Jammu
we'll do a lot of shopping.

293
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,690
You two will have
to go to India alone.

294
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,310
Why, is everything fine?

295
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,110
There's an emergency, Alka.

296
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,190
The department has called
me to the office for an urgent job.

297
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,420
I am sorry, Alka.

298
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,840
I think I will have
to work for another day.

299
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,520
Mamma was right.
You can never retire.

300
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,480
Why aren't we stopping?

301
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,200
Are we supposed
to be stopping here?

302
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,500
How can this be?

303
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,150
My ticket is valid to this station.

304
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,000
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Where's the train manager?

305
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,780
Excuse me.

306
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,260
Could you tell us what's going on?

307
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,770
Yeah. Why haven't we stopped?

308
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,710
Please, be calm.
There is nothing to worry about.

309
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,640
You sure passed our
station without stopping.

310
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,940
How can you tell me not to worry?

311
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,780
Sir, please. Sit down.
- No. No. No.

312
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,430
Shut up and tell
us what's going on.

313
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,380
Calm down.

314
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,460
Excuse me.

315
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,960
Why didn't he tell
us why didn't he stop?

316
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
What's going on?

317
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,970
This is Chief Inspector
Shivan Menon, narcotics branch.

318
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,640
Please open the door.

319
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,590
Is there any problem?

320
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:19,970
Yes, sir.

321
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,470
The metropolitan police
have confirmed a bomb blast...

322
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,610
...that occurred this
morning on a Northern Railway.

323
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,660
That a Manchester bound
goods train exploded...

324
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,090
...this morning near York.

325
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,660
I am currently standing outside
Platform 10 at Euston station.

326
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,010
That a similar bomb
has been placed on...

327
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,410
...the London-Glasgow train
112 that left this morning

328
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,530
Police suspect this is
where the bomb was planted.

329
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,460
Sir, is there some sort of crisis?

330
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,820
Many trains have been stopped.

331
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,240
Sir, there was a blast on 509...
- No comments.

332
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,760
Are all the tracks
ahead of it clear?

333
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,500
Sir, they are clear
for the next three stations.

334
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,440
A lot of trains are getting delayed
because of these diversions.

335
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,500
There cannot be any issue
greater than this, at the moment.

336
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,930
See, I don't care.
- Sir...

337
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:09,390
Even if I've to cancel every single
train in the whole of England.

338
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:09,960
Yeah.

339
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,160
If you do what I say...
- Sir, but... Sir.

340
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,770
Just do what I say.
- Arjun Khanna.

341
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,710
Counter Terrorism Command.

342
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,780
Sanjay Raina.
Railway Traffic Controller.

343
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,950
I heard that you spoke
to the bomber. - Yes.

344
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,780
You handled the situation well,
Mr. Raina.

345
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:25,020
In spite of you talking
to him he didn't blast the train.

346
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,820
Otherwise police's job
would have gotten easier.

347
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Sir.

348
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,210
Excuse me.

349
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,380
Mr. Raina, how long will
it take the train to reach Glasgow?

350
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,530
About 101/2 hours.

351
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,000
Yes, Miranda?

352
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,340
These are the trains that were
diverted to the south-east line.

353
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,420
And which is this one?

354
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,590
It's alright. Just give it to me.

355
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
Who could it be?

356
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,380
Not a terrorist.

357
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,360
If he would've been one,
he couldn't have called to inform.

358
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,200
He would've called after the
incident to claim responsibility.

359
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,350
If he is not a terrorist
then what does he want?

360
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,790
Get me that.

361
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,450
You spoke to the bomber, Mr. Raina.

362
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,070
It's your job to give
me the details. - Fine.

363
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,710
Was he an Indian or a Pakistani?

364
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,980
I think an Indian.
- Why do you think so?

365
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,500
Because he was talking
in Hindi and not Urdu.

366
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,190
Which accent was he talking in?
Gujarati, Bengali, Punjabi?

367
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,270
Look,
-Sir.

368
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,890
Sir, we have a huge problem here.

369
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,280
Train 308 is on our track
coming from the opposite direction.

370
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,350
Oh, God.

371
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,630
We diverted all the other trains,
except this one.

372
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,410
How far is 308 from the other one?

373
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,730
10 minutes.
- Change the track.

374
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:25,910
We can't do that, sir.
- Why?

375
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,440
Because there are only
two tracks in that area.

376
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,680
And there is already a stopped
goods train on that track.

377
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,620
There should be an exchange
line before the station.

378
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,780
Ken, get me your aerial
feed on the large monitor.

379
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,260
Okay. This is our train.

380
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,150
And on the same track
308 is coming towards us.

381
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,830
And on this track there
is just one exchange line.

382
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,750
Sir, this is the maintenance line.

383
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:52,590
You cannot change the track
with the speed of more than 50m/hr.

384
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,590
The train will topple.
- Even I know that.

385
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:58,320
Railways, as a safety precaution,
sets the limits 15-20 miles lower.

386
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,870
We'll have to take this
turn at the speed of more than 60.

387
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,470
We have to take that chance.
- But sir...

388
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,200
We have to take that chance,
Radhika.

389
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,280
How long it will take for our
train to reach the exchange point?

390
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,800
Three minutes.

391
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,230
And 308?
- Sir, five minutes.

392
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,430
Sir... - If both the trains
have to cross safely then...

393
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,760
...both have to reach their
exchange point at the same time.

394
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:24,150
Radhika, tell the driver of
308 to come towards us at 97m/hr.

395
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,030
Are you sure, sir?
- Just do it, Radhika.

396
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,710
John, give me the headphones.

397
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,530
Richard, hear me carefully.

398
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,350
There's an inbound
train coming your way.

399
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,740
You have to reduce
your speed to 65m/hr.

400
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,690
Do it now, Richard.

401
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,110
But 65m/hr is too close
to the trigger point.

402
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,740
Damn it, Richard. You have
to take that risk or it's over.

403
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,980
Do it now.

404
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,580
Kevin, you be on your toes.

405
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,110
You make the change when
they give you the signal.

406
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,080
You hear me, Kevin?

407
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,830
Three. Two. One.

408
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:08,970
Now.

409
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,040
Now.

410
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:46,050
It's time not for celebrate.
This is just the beginning, guys.

411
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,650
Please get back to work.
Thanks. Thank you.

412
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,290
Yes, Vikas?

413
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,740
Sir, I've checked the database of...

414
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,180
...all Indian and Pakistani
history-sheeters.

415
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,150
All of them are under the
watchful eyes of our officers.

416
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,870
I don't think he
is one of them. - Okay.

417
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,890
That means he's a new scoundrel.

418
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,180
Okay, do one thing.

419
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,770
Reach Railway's goods station.
I'll meet you there.

420
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,440
"Without you..."

421
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,000
"Without you I feel restless."

422
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,430
"I feel restless."

423
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,540
"Without you..."

424
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,990
"Without you I feel restless."

425
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,370
"I feel restless."

426
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:22,440
"You are my life."

427
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:30,290
"You are my happiness."

428
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:37,780
"You are my prayer."

429
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:47,120
He's get a British citizenship
if he marries you.

430
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,990
And also be the
proprietor of my wealth.

431
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,750
And yet, you want to
make him my son-in-law.

432
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,350
Whether or not you
make him your son-in-law...

433
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,040
...I surely want
him to be my husband.

434
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,120
Oh, shut up.

435
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,310
What is his stature, after all?

436
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,260
Father, show some respect.

437
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,540
He's better educated than you are.
He's an engineer.

438
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,560
Nikita, if you want to
spend your life with them...

439
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,530
...then you'll have
to leave this house.

440
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,270
Aakash, come on.

441
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,470
"I swear."

442
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,820
"I swear, beloved."

443
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,180
"I am..."

444
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,470
"I am crazy about you."

445
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,880
"How do I live?"

446
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,410
"How do I live, tell me."

447
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,710
"I can't die either."

448
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,190
"I swear."

449
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,480
"I swear, beloved."

450
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,950
"I am..."

451
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,280
"I am crazy about you."

452
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,650
"How do I live?"

453
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,170
"How do I live, tell me."

454
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,020
"I can't die either."

455
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:16,410
"You are my life."

456
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:23,560
"You are my prayer."

457
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:27,920
"Without you..."

458
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,760
"Without you I feel restless."

459
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,190
"I feel restless."

460
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,150
"How do I say it?"
"Where do I go?"

461
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,170
"Who do I worship?"

462
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,830
"Who do I worship?"

463
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:21,790
Excuse me. Manish Solanki.
He's in Ward A, bed four.

464
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,180
Okay. One moment.

465
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,220
The payment has to be
made before the operation.

466
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,930
Sir, I have checked
the entire CCTV footage.

467
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:33,970
I couldn't see anyone.

468
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,000
Okay, when did
the goods train come?

469
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,440
Here, sir. On this track.

470
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,200
This area, sir.

471
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,390
Forceps.

472
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:48,950
Vikas.

473
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,890
I want the footage of the
past 24 hours from this camera.

474
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,640
Is this your bike?

475
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,220
Yes, it is.
- How many bikes do you have?

476
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,450
Five in total.

477
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,370
And all five of them
were with you last night?

478
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,500
No, three of them were with me.

479
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,300
Two of them are in the
garage getting repaired.

480
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,660
Where's the garage?

481
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,990
The Alfa point center.
Over on Richard Street.

482
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,590
Thank you.

483
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,250
Railway Control Security.
May I help you?

484
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,430
I want Sanjay.

485
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,250
Sanjay here.

486
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:48,340
Stay close to the phone or this
train won't stay close to the ground.

487
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,280
Okay.

488
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,260
What do you want?

489
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
10 million euros.

490
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:54,810
Old currency.

491
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,300
Why this silence?

492
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,350
You aren't paying from your pocket.

493
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,460
10 million isn't
much for 500 lives.

494
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
Listen...

495
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,560
You have one hour.

496
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,640
Exactly.

497
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,080
Yes, Vikas?

498
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,180
Sir, the bomber has
asked for 10 million euros.

499
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,190
Then the bomb will surely blow.

500
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,960
The ministry won't
pay up so easily.

501
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,180
What's the ministry's take on it?

502
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,910
They haven't taken
any decision as yet, sir.

503
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,960
Will they take a decision
after the bomb explodes?

504
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,080
Anyway, keep me posted.

505
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,240
The smoke meter's diaphragm...

506
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,730
Greetings.

507
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,090
Welcome.

508
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,230
What happened? Your car stalled?

509
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,310
Police.

510
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,960
Look, sir, I will tell you.

511
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,060
I am sure Mrs. Khanna
must have lodged a complaint.

512
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:51,090
Mrs. Khanna on purpose
wears skimpy clothes...

513
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,180
...and passes by my window.
I get compelled to whistle. I...

514
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,580
How many people work in here?

515
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,910
Here? Only six.

516
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,140
Everyone has a permit.

517
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,800
Everyone?
- Two don't.

518
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,110
It will come. I am trying.

519
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,240
Where are they?
- Here.

520
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,360
Novice. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

521
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,460
Hurry up.

522
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,310
Say hello to sir.

523
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,360
Hello.

524
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,220
Where's the other one?
The dark egg?

525
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,180
Sir, he didn't come today.
- He didn't?

526
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,010
I look at their innocent faces
and give them work and get trapped.

527
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,180
Where were you last night?
- I was with Mrs. Patil.

528
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,610
My wife, sir.

529
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,160
Where were you?

530
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,420
I was here, at work, sir.
- Alone?

531
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,020
Tell him.
- No, sir. Aadil was with me.

532
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:29,850
Who is Aadil?

533
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,440
The one I told you about.
The boy working without a permit.

534
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,710
The other mechanic.

535
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,070
He was with you the entire night?

536
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,440
Yes. No.

537
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:39,410
He had left to test the bike.

538
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,490
What time?

539
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,960
At 10 or 11pm.

540
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,130
Which bike?

541
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,760
Chip Shop's owner's bike.

542
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,300
Fish and chips' bike?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

543
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,970
Do you know Aadil? His whereabouts?
Where does he stay?

544
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,350
Do you have his address?

545
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,260
Sir, he didn't have a permit.
I just appointed him.

546
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,960
So, now we don't have documents.

547
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,560
One day you too will go
to jail along with such boys.

548
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,210
Vikas. Immediately send
a sketch artist to Alfa Garage.

549
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,560
We need a sketch
of a boy named Aadil.

550
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,370
Yeah!
- I guess we have got our guy.

551
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,190
What? There's a bomb?

552
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,750
What? A bomb on the train?
- There's a bomb on the train.

553
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,010
Listen, everybody.
There's a bomb on the train.

554
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,450
Oh, my God.
- Are you sure?

555
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,750
You lie to us.

556
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,860
Everybody, there's a bomb
on the train. - What?

557
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,360
How do you know it.
- It's all over the news.

558
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,800
There's a bomb.

559
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,140
Get inside.
Why don't you tell us.

560
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,690
Why don't you tell
us that we're in dangerous.

561
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,300
Shut the door.
- And get inside.

562
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,170
Leave him alone.
- There's a bomb on the train.

563
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,150
Don't push it.

564
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:49,570
Go back to your seats and sit down.
Everybody.

565
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,280
Stop it.
- You...

566
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,070
I'll blow your head
off if you touch anybody.

567
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,180
Okay? Go back to your seat.

568
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,880
Go.

569
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,170
Yes, there's a bomb on this train.

570
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,180
We can't stop or even
reduce the speed below 60m/hr.

571
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,200
Or the bomb will explode.

572
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:20,440
We can either panic right
now and make things hard...

573
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,520
...or we can stay calm and...

574
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,800
...trust the government
to get us out of this mess.

575
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,430
The position of the
British government...

576
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:30,660
...on terrorist acts is very clear.

577
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:35,180
There will be no
negotiation whatsoever.

578
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,160
Let's make it official.

579
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,100
All in favor raise your hands.

580
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:53,200
Mr. Khanna doesn't seem
to agree with our opinion.

581
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,720
May I ask you exactly
what do you have in mind?

582
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,670
I think we should
have the money ready.

583
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:05,090
Sir, all I am asking you
to is make the money visible.

584
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,180
It will be a tool
for me to negotiate.

585
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,340
A way to get the
boomer out in the open.

586
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,060
It will be just a bait.

587
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,830
And if you lose the
criminal and the money?

588
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,600
Sir...

589
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,190
You've believed in me for 23 years.

590
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,520
And I never failed to deliver.

591
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,240
You called me back from retirement
all because of your trust.

592
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,910
Just trust me one last time.

593
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,500
And I promise you...

594
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,310
I'll not lose the money
or the passengers on the train.

595
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,340
I'll get him.

596
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,570
Sir, Aadil's sketch has matched.

597
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,420
This is his file from
the immigration department.

598
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,280
Aadil Khan.

599
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:46,630
He came here from India, 7
years ago, on a tourist visa, sir.

600
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,970
With a music troupe.

601
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,170
He neither went back
nor did he ever get caught.

602
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,540
Dispatch his photo and all his
details to all the police stations.

603
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,740
Bus stations.
Police stations. Airports.

604
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:57,610
Everywhere.
Keep the police officers ready.

605
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,640
Yes, sir.

606
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,780
What's the news on the train?

607
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,640
The conductors have checked
all the compartments.

608
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,780
They didn't find any bomb, sir.

609
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,230
This means the bomb isn't
controlled by a lunatic.

610
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,030
This bomb is now
controlled by speed.

611
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,260
Listen, Vikas.

612
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,500
From Railway Control Centre take
the details of the next bridge.

613
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:14,970
I need 4- 5 high speed
cameras under that bridge.

614
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:18,480
I ant clear pictures
of every compartment's base.

615
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,080
Dear, I'm a little busy.
Can I... - Daddy...

616
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,230
Am I going to die?

617
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,280
What are you saying, Pia?

618
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:40,590
Everyone here is saying
that there is a bomb in the train.

619
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:42,220
Everyone is going to die.

620
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:45,360
No.

621
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:48,750
I am concentrating
only on your train.

622
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,330
I won't let anything happen to you.

623
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:53,810
Promise?

624
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:57,870
I promise.

625
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,340
Excuse me, Dr. Renu.
- Yes?

626
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,080
Please report to the front desk.
There's a telephone call for you.

627
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:09,450
Okay.

628
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,150
Hello. - Hello, Renu?
Renu, don't hang up.

629
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,030
Is Pia alright?

630
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,650
Renu...
- Coffee.

631
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:24,110
Pia is on a train.

632
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,290
And we've just got the news
that there is a bomb in that train.

633
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:33,760
Then stop the train
and get Pia out.

634
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:35,830
We cannot do that.

635
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,190
Until I don't inform you
anything about the train...

636
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:42,880
...don't believe in
what anyone else says.

637
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:45,770
I'll keep in touch.

638
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:47,610
Okay?

639
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,730
That way, sir.

640
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:55,810
Stop.

641
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,160
Now rewind.

642
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:01,710
Stop.

643
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:03,980
Zoom.

644
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:08,200
Bomb squad reports?
- That way, sir.

645
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,930
They say that the goods
train too had a similar bomb.

646
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,030
You see, sir,
there is an electronic dynamo.

647
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,510
It's sensor is attached
to the wheel of the train.

648
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:18,220
If the speed of the
train goes below 60...

649
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,710
...the dynamo will activate the
trigger and the bomb will explode.

650
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,320
It's all mentioned here, sir.

651
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,780
Under which compartments
is the bomb placed?

652
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:25,720
Four and seven.

653
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,210
Connect me to the
engineering department.

654
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:29,400
Send all the passengers
in the first three compartments.

655
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,990
Separate the rest of
the compartments from them.

656
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,130
I think that should work.

657
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:35,650
I don't think that's possible.
What you are saying is impossible.

658
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,590
Why is it not possible?

659
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:41,220
If we switch off the main
hydraulics of the train then...

660
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,280
You don't understand.

661
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,290
This train runs on
an automatic system.

662
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:47,160
If you switch off the hydraulics,
the train will stop right there.

663
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,480
And that bomb will explode.

664
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,470
You mean to say there
is no way to stop the train?

665
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,950
There is no way you can stop
that train... - If there was any...

666
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,470
I would've stopped it.

667
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,230
My daughter is on that train.

668
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:58,470
My daughter is on that train.

669
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,670
Hello.

670
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:08,820
Sanjay.

671
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,420
Sanjay, my money?
- It's ready.

672
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,300
Do you have any idea
of how many innocent lives...

673
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,560
...you are putting in danger?

674
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:18,610
If you get caught you'll die.
Why are you playing with your life?

675
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,860
One shouldn't love life too much.

676
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,260
In the end,
everyone has to lose it.

677
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:27,880
Look, I can help you
if you have been wronged.

678
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:30,460
You won't be able to catch
me even if you talk for long.

679
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,820
Give me my money, otherwise...
- Where to the money delivered?

680
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:35,790
Who are you?

681
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:37,530
Arjun Khanna.
Counter Terrorist Command.

682
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:39,230
I'll get your money.
Where should I get it?

683
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:41,100
Mr. Khanna, put the money in a bag.

684
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:43,040
There should be no
tracking device in it.

685
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,140
Nor should there
be any officer with you.

686
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,790
You should come alone.

687
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:51,230
Till I don't get the money no one will
know the way to defuse the bomb.

688
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,740
Gleynamand collage. Sorry.

689
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,080
In 20 minutes.

690
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,910
Are you Mr. Arjun Khanna?

691
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,390
Yes, Father.

692
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:35,810
Then I guess this belongs to you.

693
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:39,220
A gentleman delivered
it to us this morning.

694
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,300
He said you'll be
coming to collect it.

695
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:46,480
Did you happen to see his face?
- Sorry, I didn't.

696
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,630
He was wearing some kind of helmet.

697
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:50,420
But he did seem to
be in a great hurry.

698
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,220
Hello.

699
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,630
Mr. Khanna?
- Speaking.

700
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:55,710
Get into a car.

701
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:57,800
Get out through the
forth gate and take a left.

702
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,630
Go straight and take another left.

703
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,120
It will take you to an
unpaved road. Keep driving.

704
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,110
It was that scoundrel's call.

705
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:07,760
Vikas, I'm calling you.
You'll get this mobile's number.

706
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:10,140
As soon as the
bomber calls again...

707
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,290
...trace his exact
location and tell me.

708
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:13,750
I'm taking this car.

709
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:27,210
Did you see "the inn" board?

710
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,680
Yes.

711
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,890
Turn right from there.

712
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:43,480
Half a kilometer away you will
see an "animal crossing" board.

713
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:45,440
Take a left from there.

714
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:46,670
Okay.

715
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:51,890
Sir. Sir.

716
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,400
Yes, Vikas. Tell me.

717
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,050
Sir, the call got traced.

718
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,500
What's the exact location?

719
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,070
Alexandra, Bun No. 67 Hogway.

720
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:00,630
Okay. Go for him and get him alive.

721
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:02,430
I'll keep him busy.
- Okay, sir.

722
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,650
Come on, guys.
Let's get inside. Let's move.

723
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:07,470
Animal crossing road.

724
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:16,240
Got it. I got it.

725
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,400
Turn right.

726
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,550
Hello.

727
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:39,550
I can't see any Richards
Farm's board here.

728
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,000
Mr. Khanna, I guess
you aren't paying attention.

729
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:43,820
I think I'll have to hang up.

730
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,490
Yes, I can see it. I can see it.

731
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:22,660
This is the police.
You've been surrounded.

732
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:25,900
Slowly come out with
your hands over your head.

733
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:28,610
There is no other way out for you.

734
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,720
Freeze.

735
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:50,190
Don't take a wrong
turn at any cost today.

736
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,430
It can prove to be dangerous.

737
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:52,870
Stop the car near
the Rapid's board.

738
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:58,510
He watches a lot of English movies.

739
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,810
I'll have to give him that.

740
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:04,820
Will you tell us what to do next.

741
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,480
Get out of the car.

742
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:17,200
By now you must have
reached a riverbank.

743
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:20,770
Yes.

744
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:25,710
There, below a tree, there's
a yellow waterproof suitcase.

745
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,580
Got it?

746
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,740
Keep the money in it.

747
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,720
Now throw the
suitcase in the water.

748
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:05,340
I said, throw the suitcase
in the water and walk away.

749
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:01,970
I want all units to setup a two
kilometer radius around this area.

750
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,610
All highway routes
should be blocked.

751
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:08,090
No vehicle should be allowed
to pass without being checked.

752
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:21,500
Please stop otherwise
we will have to open fire.

753
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:23,310
This is your last warning.

754
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:27,660
Please stop otherwise
we will have to open fire.

755
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,230
This is your very last warning.

756
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:32,120
...is escaping.

757
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:57,140
Move. Move.

758
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:38,870
Every time I think you
cannot do anything more stupid...

759
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:39,980
...you prove me wrong.

760
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,530
What do you think of yourself.

761
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:42,940
Who told you to give in?

762
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,920
How are we going
to stop the train now?

763
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,810
Hey, look, if you can't handle it,
you should've left it to us.

764
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:49,170
You are an amateur.

765
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,560
It was an accident.

766
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,870
You coming back was the accident.

767
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:54,720
We needed him alive.

768
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:00,520
The bomber is still alive.

769
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:01,940
She was not the bomber.

770
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,020
She?

771
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,160
Don't look confused.

772
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,400
There's more than one
person involved in this crime.

773
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:11,470
So, how do you intend to proceed?

774
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:13,820
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

775
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,130
As you know, Alan, that
investigations are based on leads.

776
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,480
And I have one.

777
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:21,660
Vikas.
- Sir.

778
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,030
I got this hospital bill
from that girl's pocket.

779
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:25,740
Get all the details possible.

780
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:27,800
And do this fast.
We are running out of time.

781
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,560
Miss, please come with us.
- I can't.

782
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:01,100
She's getting off.

783
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:08,740
Come on, get her.

784
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:18,580
No. Please let me go.
Let me go, please.

785
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,800
Please. I have not done anything.

786
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,730
What's happening?
What's happening out here?

787
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:26,560
Please, don't hand
me over to the police.

788
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:29,120
They will send me back to India.
Please.

789
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,280
It's my...
It's a question of my life.

790
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:35,840
Along with mine, my family's
life will also get ruined.

791
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,730
Please. Let me go. Please.

792
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:42,040
I haven't done anything wrong.

793
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:46,120
I'm scared for my life.

794
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:48,010
Please, sir.

795
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:09,020
Hello?

796
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:11,560
Did everything go well, sir?

797
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:14,730
Hello?

798
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:16,850
Where are you?

799
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:18,490
Where is Megha?

800
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:19,890
Megha is dead.

801
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:23,870
No. Oh, God.

802
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:25,990
Aadil.
- No!

803
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:27,070
Aadil!

804
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:37,000
Moments ago,
a high speed chase on the M25...

805
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,620
...has resulted in the death
of the London railway bomber.

806
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,640
Authorities have said that the
bomber, a female in her twenties...

807
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:44,980
...was trying to escape
on her dirt-bike...

808
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:47,490
...and had a fatal accident
during the chase with the police.

809
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,340
Hello?
- Hello, Sanjay?

810
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,850
Sanjay, tell me the truth.

811
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:59,990
Everyone here is telling
me a different story.

812
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:03,700
I had told you, no matter what
anyone tells you about this train...

813
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,140
...don't believe in it.

814
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,760
But in the news they are
showing that the bomber is dead.

815
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,720
That train won't stop.

816
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,800
Media...

817
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,290
Media has gone crazy.

818
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:17,470
The bomber is a guy.
He is still alive.

819
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:19,360
And I am talking to him.

820
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:22,180
I hope you are not saying
so just to calm me down.

821
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:26,200
Do one thing.
Talk to her. You'll feel better.

822
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:33,870
Hello?

823
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:34,950
Hello.

824
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:36,470
Hello, Pia?

825
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:37,580
Mamma?

826
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:39,330
Are you alright, dear?

827
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:42,710
Yes. But how did you get my number?

828
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:45,340
Your father gave it to me.

829
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:46,980
You spoke to him?

830
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:48,560
Yes, dear.

831
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:54,730
The bomber is dead.

832
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:56,890
It's all over.

833
01:04:57,490 --> 01:04:59,150
We are all going to die.

834
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:00,810
I'm not die like this.

835
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:03,580
I bet we can jump off this train.
- Please sit down.

836
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:06,580
How are you going to defuse the
bomb if the bomber is already dead?

837
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,190
The bomber is not dead.

838
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,400
How do you know?

839
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:11,930
My daddy is a chief
of railway control centre.

840
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:13,920
What's your name?
- Pia.

841
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:14,800
Pia Raina.

842
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,460
Okay, Pia,
what did your father say?

843
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:19,030
He told my mother that
the bomber is not dead.

844
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,770
Can I talk to your father?

845
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,680
I found sister-in-law's address.

846
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:46,790
She's a teacher in
some kindergarten school.

847
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:49,430
I didn't get any other information.

848
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:59,180
Megha's brother's operation
was to take place today.

849
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:00,260
Of what?

850
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:03,220
He has started lose vision.
Both his eyes.

851
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:06,360
The operation is very expensive.

852
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:10,070
And if he doesn't get it done,
he can go blind.

853
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:18,150
I think they have found
out that we are Indians.

854
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:27,460
Unit four, are you in position?

855
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,420
In position, sir. Shall I go in?
- No.

856
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:31,010
Hold your positions.

857
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,470
Nobody approaches the
target without my orders.

858
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:41,730
Aadil, run.

859
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:52,060
Hey.

860
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:03,500
Hey, stop.
- Stop. - No.

861
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:22,930
Hey.

862
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:29,690
Stop.

863
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:32,580
Come

864
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:33,750
Whoa, whoa.

865
01:07:36,830 --> 01:07:37,960
Get him. Get him.

866
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:50,110
Just kill him.

867
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:57,390
Whoa

868
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:12,680
Move!

869
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,850
No. Get him.

870
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:03,060
Watch it, man.

871
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:37,370
Get him.

872
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,590
Stop, or I shoot.

873
01:09:45,090 --> 01:09:47,180
Get down, everybody get down.

874
01:09:58,410 --> 01:09:59,410
I've got him.

875
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:13,160
Clear the bridge. Clear the bridge.

876
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:20,140
Stop. I said stop.

877
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:21,880
Damn it.

878
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:54,960
Drive.

879
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:32,700
Good morning.
- Good morning.

880
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:34,740
Here. Have some sweets.

881
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:37,610
Sweets? What are we celebrating?

882
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,880
Remember, I had told
you about my brother, Manish?

883
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:44,040
He has got an admission
in an engineering college here.

884
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:46,330
Oh, that's nice.

885
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:49,080
But how did he come to UK?

886
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,570
He didn't come through
illegitimate means like us, sir.

887
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:53,250
He has come legally.

888
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:54,820
He has got student visa.

889
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:56,900
Then you deserve
double congratulations.

890
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:58,490
He'll be an engineer like me.

891
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:00,690
This has been possible
only because of you.

892
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,800
You had done a lot of favors.

893
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,880
My parents...
- Enough. Enough. Enough.

894
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,070
Give me the sweets.

895
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,080
This is a routine check.
Stay where they are.

896
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,060
This is the UK Border Agency.

897
01:12:21,190 --> 01:12:23,200
Everybody stay where they are.

898
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,820
Wait a minute. Sir, please.

899
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,770
Sir, people from the immigration
department are outside.

900
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,270
They are checking
everyone's papers.

901
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:39,350
What should we do?

902
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:47,900
Aadil. You leave with Megha.

903
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:50,160
Sir, but you?

904
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:51,880
I'll take care of them.
You both leave.

905
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,670
But, sir, you too.
- Just stop it.

906
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:54,880
I said go.

907
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:57,610
Come on, Megha, let's go.
- Go.

908
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:13,320
Hi, Officer.
Is there a problem here?

909
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:16,660
My name is Peter Harvey from
the Department of Immigration.

910
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:19,310
And a few of them
don't seem to have...

911
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:23,050
...the proper documentation
to work in the UK.

912
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:25,940
I guess I am not aware of that.

913
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:27,520
What's your job here, sir?

914
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:29,990
I am the CEO.
- And who owns the company?

915
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:32,520
My wife.
- Can I see your papers, please?

916
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:38,000
I have applied for my
citizenship and work permit.

917
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:40,220
I have a copy of that.
- Sir, without citizenship...

918
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:42,400
...and work permit you
cannot work in this country.

919
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:44,750
I'm afraid you
have to come with us.

920
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:03,370
It's okay.
It's okay. It's almost done.

921
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:05,710
Just relax.

922
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,720
May I know who he is?

923
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:15,420
Someone who has nothing to lose.

924
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:17,340
And you?

925
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:21,580
Someone who has lost everything.

926
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:22,910
Let's go.

927
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:31,320
Thanks, Doctor.

928
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:01,070
I think we should stop right here.

929
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:04,890
Why?

930
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,970
Our intention was to commit
a crime and get our lives back.

931
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:14,460
Without endangering anyone's life.

932
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:19,320
Megha has lost her life.

933
01:15:21,170 --> 01:15:22,380
And you are injured.

934
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,750
I don't want the money
at the expense of your life.

935
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:33,440
It's no use backing out now, sir.

936
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,810
Megha is dead.

937
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:39,890
And if I didn't have the
hope that you would return...

938
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:43,360
...then I would've
hanged myself long back.

939
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:46,350
Who do we fear?

940
01:15:47,530 --> 01:15:51,240
If we don't win,
what do we have to lose?

941
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:56,690
And if we win,
we have our lives ahead of us.

942
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:05,170
Give it here.

943
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:07,350
Yeah, Sanjay here.

944
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:09,430
Everyone in this world
wants to go to heaven.

945
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:11,980
But no one wants
to die to go to heaven.

946
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,030
Your mistake will today
take those passengers to heaven.

947
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:16,330
The deal is off.

948
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:28,510
Have you gone mad?

949
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,290
Who the hell do you think you are?

950
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:34,850
When the government
had given you the money...

951
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:37,380
...to give to the bomber
then why did you have to act smart?

952
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:40,220
You should have quietly given
the money and defused the bomb.

953
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:43,430
That money was a means
to catch those scoundrels.

954
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,240
Not to fulfill their demands.

955
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:47,740
Now just calm down.

956
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:49,580
Now don't you tell me to calm down.

957
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,510
I've been trying my best
to save the train since morning...

958
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:54,620
...so that you get time
for your investigation.

959
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,040
A lot of time has been wasted,
but the little hope that we had...

960
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:59,640
...you have ruined that as well.

961
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:02,850
Mr. Sanjay, I understand.
- No, you don't understand.

962
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:04,910
Because you don't have anyone
close to you on that train.

963
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:07,970
Shut up. Everyone in that
train has a near and dear one.

964
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:10,710
I don't need a reason
to save people's lives.

965
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:12,670
It's my job. It's my duty.

966
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:14,370
He will call back.

967
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:15,810
Why will he call back?
How do you know so?

968
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:18,000
I'm telling you, he will call.
- Why will he call?

969
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,570
Because he won't leave
without taking his money.

970
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:22,920
He will not call. - It's him.
- He will call.

971
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:24,870
It's him.

972
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:34,160
Hello. - Take the money and
go St. Georges hall.

973
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,300
And don't do anything stupid thi

974
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:37,680
Last chance.

975
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:10,370
Excuse me, mister. This is for you.

976
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:16,380
Who gave you this? Hey, listen.

977
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,640
Put the bag in the
trash can behind you.

978
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:57,720
Keep an eye on the green dustbin.

979
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,150
I repeat...
Green dustbin.

980
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:05,400
Alpha Team, talk to me.

981
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:08,100
No, sir. Nothing yet.

982
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,420
Snipers.
Keep an eye on the green dustbin.

983
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:13,560
No fatal shots.
I want this guy alive. - Okay.

984
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,090
Here's your coffee, sir.

985
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:22,280
Okay. Thank you.

986
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:32,520
Sir, I've just seen
something in his hand.

987
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,010
Bravo Team, do you see anything?

988
01:19:42,090 --> 01:19:44,740
No sir, still looking. Nothing yet.

989
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:47,340
He will come. We will see him soon.

990
01:19:57,930 --> 01:20:00,180
Target confirmed.
Approaching drop point.

991
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:01,720
Everyone, now, stay calm.

992
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,150
Be focused. Be focused.

993
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:10,470
Negative, sir.

994
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:20,180
Can I have a word with you, please?

995
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:24,540
They've found a suspect.

996
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,400
That's his picture.

997
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:35,070
'Do you have the packages?'

998
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:37,970
'What's the idea?
- You'll know soon.'

999
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:46,210
Stay back.

1000
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:48,200
Move. Move. Move.

1001
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,620
Hey. Where's the emergency brake?
- I don't know, man. Calm down.

1002
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:52,560
Go ahead.
You'll show me the emergency brake.

1003
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:53,640
Stay back.

1004
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,730
Move. Move. Move. Stay down.

1005
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:02,930
The emergency brakes have to be
put on anyhow before any station.

1006
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:04,440
Where is the breaks.
There.

1007
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:09,930
Why aren't they working?

1008
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:11,670
The driver has jammed the brakes.

1009
01:23:14,810 --> 01:23:17,070
Open up or I'll
blow the door. - Stop.

1010
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:26,200
If you got to shoot someone,
shoot me.

1011
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:48,520
We got to get off this train.
We got to get off this train.

1012
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,300
We got to get off this train.
We are going to die. - Shut up.

1013
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:51,850
We are going to die.
- Shut up.

1014
01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:54,310
It's true. It's true.
- What's true?

1015
01:23:54,490 --> 01:23:57,090
I sold the explosives to him, okay?

1016
01:23:57,170 --> 01:24:00,330
I saw him at the railway station.

1017
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:01,470
Saw whom?

1018
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:03,020
The bomber.

1019
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:05,460
You know him?
- Yes.

1020
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:06,550
Who's he?

1021
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:10,010
His name is Aadil Khan.
- Where does he stay?

1022
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:17,760
Hello?

1023
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:18,930
Job's done.

1024
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,610
Yes. Yes.

1025
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:22,720
Yes.

1026
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:24,410
How are you feeling?

1027
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:26,590
Now I'm feeling great, sir.

1028
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,440
Okay, I'm coming.
I will be back in five minute.

1029
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:32,130
Okay.

1030
01:25:13,230 --> 01:25:15,490
Come on!
Come on.

1031
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:25,030
Keep moving back. Back.
- Keep moving back. - Back.

1032
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:26,980
Please. Come on.

1033
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:28,650
Please back.

1034
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:30,340
Move back.

1035
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:34,180
Move back.

1036
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:52,100
Hello. - Aadil, try leaving
through the back door.

1037
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:55,500
No, sir.
Police has surrounded the place.

1038
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:57,000
Then I'll come upstairs.

1039
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:00,680
Don't try to save me,
you too will die.

1040
01:26:00,870 --> 01:26:02,810
Then we will die together.
- Come on, move back.

1041
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:04,980
Please leave, sir.

1042
01:26:05,490 --> 01:26:06,490
Just go.

1043
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:07,810
Get back.

1044
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:09,160
Get back.

1045
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:34,500
Team A, cover. Cover.

1046
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,860
Drop your weapons.
You're surrounding.

1047
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:57,740
Come out with your hands up.

1048
01:26:58,200 --> 01:26:59,630
Come on immediately.

1049
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:02,260
Drop your weapons. You're arrested.

1050
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:03,910
Come out with your hands up.

1051
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:06,480
Immediately.

1052
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:17,860
If you move, you'll die.

1053
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:21,300
Me or we?

1054
01:28:56,420 --> 01:29:00,590
The investigation strategy
was to get the bomber alive...

1055
01:29:00,670 --> 01:29:02,670
...defuse the bomb
and save the passengers.

1056
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:03,970
And what are you doing?

1057
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:06,820
Killing them one by one.
Who the hell do you think you are?

1058
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:07,940
Dirty Harry?

1059
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,060
He blew himself up.

1060
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:12,230
It was a suicide.

1061
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:15,340
Oh, so, now,
what do you suggest we do?

1062
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:19,250
Catch the real bomber.

1063
01:29:20,490 --> 01:29:22,100
The man who has the money.
- Yeah.

1064
01:29:22,430 --> 01:29:26,640
The idea of the money
was to use it as bait.

1065
01:29:27,790 --> 01:29:31,720
Hey, he's lost all the money.
He's killing all the bombers.

1066
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,690
He screwed up the whole operation.

1067
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:36,970
For all we know, he could
be a part of the conspiracy.

1068
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:40,200
And gets his share of money
when he gets back to India.

1069
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:41,500
What did you say?

1070
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:43,680
Another word and I'll
break your jaw. - Sir.

1071
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,210
I'll break your jaw.
- Sir. Sir. No, sir.

1072
01:29:45,290 --> 01:29:46,380
Vikas, let go of me.

1073
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:48,510
Let me teach him a lesson.
- Sir, please. Please. Stop.

1074
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:50,280
What does he think of himself?
- Yes.

1075
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:52,570
Get him off me.
- You foreigner!

1076
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:54,850
Let it be, Vikas, I will show him.
- No, sir.

1077
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:56,700
Get him off me.
- Sir, let it be.

1078
01:29:56,780 --> 01:29:58,050
Leave me.
- Sir. Let it be, sir.

1079
01:29:58,130 --> 01:30:00,190
Listen to what he is saying.
- Let it be, sir. Please.

1080
01:30:02,010 --> 01:30:04,220
We are getting defamed
because of such scoundrels.

1081
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:09,980
One man plants a bomb
and because of that...

1082
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,240
...his community and
his country gets slandered.

1083
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:21,420
Today it's either me or the bomber.

1084
01:30:28,270 --> 01:30:29,220
Sanjay here.

1085
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:31,710
There's a restaurant
at Alford Lane. Delhi Darbar.

1086
01:30:32,290 --> 01:30:33,920
There's a table
booked in your name.

1087
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:35,930
You'll find an
envelope on the table.

1088
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,280
It contains the instructions
on how to defuse the bomb.

1089
01:30:58,940 --> 01:31:00,680
"I am dew."

1090
01:31:01,730 --> 01:31:04,770
"You are my dawn."

1091
01:31:05,310 --> 01:31:07,820
"I am love."

1092
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:10,140
"You are my world."

1093
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:14,220
"I am the speaker."

1094
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:17,390
"You are my prayer."

1095
01:31:17,950 --> 01:31:20,390
"I am the ground."

1096
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:22,950
"You are my sky."

1097
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:27,080
"We met,
in spite of being worlds apart."

1098
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,350
That's my husband. He's my husband.

1099
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,830
"Nothing came between us."
- He's my husband.

1100
01:31:33,910 --> 01:31:40,060
"Let me spend my life with you,
beloved."

1101
01:31:40,210 --> 01:31:46,450
"Let me spend my life with you,
beloved."

1102
01:31:46,530 --> 01:31:48,050
Aakash.
- "In your arms..."

1103
01:31:48,130 --> 01:31:49,580
"In your path..."

1104
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:51,130
"In your arms..."

1105
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:52,650
"In your path..."

1106
01:31:52,810 --> 01:31:55,990
"Let me spend my life."

1107
01:31:56,070 --> 01:32:02,620
"Let me spend my life with you,
beloved."

1108
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,220
I tried hard to look for you.

1109
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,340
Phone calls, letters, emails.

1110
01:32:30,990 --> 01:32:32,310
But I didn't get any reply.

1111
01:32:33,650 --> 01:32:35,530
Then I thought of
asking your father.

1112
01:32:36,970 --> 01:32:38,030
All I got was abuses.

1113
01:32:38,110 --> 01:32:40,060
I was in prison for six months.

1114
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:45,280
The loan we took was in my name.

1115
01:32:46,990 --> 01:32:49,270
After you left, I couldn't
repay the loan on my own.

1116
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:53,700
First I went under trial
and then I was imprisoned.

1117
01:33:02,370 --> 01:33:03,370
Our child?

1118
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:07,070
He's playing outside.

1119
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:10,290
He?

1120
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:26,260
Daddy.

1121
01:33:41,610 --> 01:33:42,950
How did he recognize me?

1122
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:51,270
I've been telling your son about
you since the last four years.

1123
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:55,050
And everyday, he looks at
this picture and waits for you.

1124
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,370
What is your name?
- Aakash.

1125
01:34:05,350 --> 01:34:07,050
Go out and play, Aakash.

1126
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:13,510
The name Aakash
holds some hope to it.

1127
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:16,110
I wish you were here.

1128
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,130
I wish we were together.

1129
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:21,920
I couldn't find a name better
than Aakash to live with this hope.

1130
01:34:26,330 --> 01:34:27,790
Nikita, I'm here to take you.

1131
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:40,770
Come back, man. Come back.

1132
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,590
The letter that you had
kept for us in Delhi Darbar...

1133
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:50,400
...got burnt with the restaurant.

1134
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:52,260
We are making an appeal.

1135
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:54,520
Call us for the last
time and tell us...

1136
01:34:54,730 --> 01:34:56,590
...how do we disarm this bomb.

1137
01:34:56,670 --> 01:34:57,830
This is an appeal.

1138
01:34:57,910 --> 01:34:59,130
Thank you. That's it.

1139
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:01,680
How much time do we have?

1140
01:35:01,810 --> 01:35:03,890
Sir, two hours.

1141
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:06,390
Okay. One second.

1142
01:35:06,810 --> 01:35:09,900
Ask the rescue team,
if we run another train...

1143
01:35:10,650 --> 01:35:12,570
...parallel to this one,
at the same speed...

1144
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:17,960
...can they transfer the passengers
from one train to another?

1145
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:22,850
Come on. Come on.

1146
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,660
Come on. Come on.

1147
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:46,470
Come on you can do it.
Come on.

1148
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:48,700
Move your hand. Come on.

1149
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:51,110
You rigth there.
Come on. Come on.

1150
01:35:51,660 --> 01:35:52,910
Keep moving.

1151
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:54,750
Keep moving.

1152
01:35:57,510 --> 01:35:58,590
Grab my hand.

1153
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,190
Come on. Steady. Steady.

1154
01:36:01,550 --> 01:36:02,550
Be careful.

1155
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:12,080
Come on!

1156
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:13,040
Keep closing.

1157
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:14,230
Come on, Come on.

1158
01:36:14,490 --> 01:36:16,470
Don't look down.

1159
01:36:17,790 --> 01:36:19,850
Don't look down.
Keet going.

1160
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:21,510
I can't.

1161
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,850
Please. Come on.
Go!

1162
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:26,140
Keep closing.

1163
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:40,660
Faster, faster.

1164
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:42,610
Leave the belt.

1165
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:45,710
You can do it.
Faster. Faste.

1166
01:36:46,730 --> 01:36:48,330
Give me your hand.

1167
01:36:48,410 --> 01:36:50,870
Turn off your belt, sir.

1168
01:36:50,950 --> 01:36:52,610
Give me your hand.

1169
01:36:52,690 --> 01:36:55,380
Turn off your belt, sir.
Give me your hand.

1170
01:36:55,650 --> 01:36:57,680
Come on. Just go in.
Down. Help it.

1171
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:07,710
Mr. Manish.
Someone's come to see you.

1172
01:37:11,070 --> 01:37:12,070
Who is it?

1173
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:15,800
I'm Megha's friend.

1174
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:19,930
She has told me about you.
And I came here to...

1175
01:37:20,590 --> 01:37:22,620
You are here to pay
the fees for the operation?

1176
01:37:25,730 --> 01:37:26,730
Yes.

1177
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,010
I'm here to pay the fees.

1178
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:30,860
You are brother Aakash, right?

1179
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,040
No, I'm Arjun.

1180
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:37,420
Which Aakash are you talking about?

1181
01:37:38,390 --> 01:37:39,490
Aakash Rana.

1182
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:42,620
My sister treated
him like a brother.

1183
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,350
She had said that
he and brother Aadil...

1184
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:48,230
...will come to meet
me before the operation.

1185
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:52,210
Surprising. Aadil never
told me anything about Aakash.

1186
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:57,140
Four years ago, he was their boss.

1187
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,540
Then, all of a sudden,
he had to shut down the company...

1188
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:02,150
...and go to a foreign country.

1189
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:05,340
I heard that he came
back a few days back.

1190
01:38:05,630 --> 01:38:07,700
Yes, Megha was saying
something about it.

1191
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:09,570
I don't remember
the company's name.

1192
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:11,200
What was the name of the company?

1193
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:12,400
Global services.

1194
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:14,640
Global services.

1195
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:16,510
Okay.

1196
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,580
Sister said she'll be
back before the operation.

1197
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:34,350
Hello, Vikas.

1198
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:37,160
Do a background
check on Aakash Rana.

1199
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,560
We deported him to
India 4-5 years ago.

1200
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:42,970
He used to work here in
a company called Global Services.

1201
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,900
I want details of his family,
his friends.

1202
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:46,580
I want details of his every move.

1203
01:38:48,910 --> 01:38:52,370
Excuse me.
Please charge for Manish Solanki.

1204
01:38:52,450 --> 01:38:54,360
I think it's Ward E, bed four.

1205
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:56,580
Sorry, what name?
- Manish Solanki.

1206
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:58,690
Oh, everything has
already been paid for, sir.

1207
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:01,540
By whom?
- Oh, he was just here.

1208
01:39:01,620 --> 01:39:04,000
He left the ward.
Just time a corridor.

1209
01:39:15,670 --> 01:39:17,810
Vikas, that scoundrel is here.

1210
01:39:18,330 --> 01:39:20,170
He just paid the hospital bill.

1211
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:22,570
I am getting all doors
and exits of the hospital closed.

1212
01:39:22,870 --> 01:39:24,260
You quickly send backup.

1213
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:28,370
Please call security.

1214
01:39:35,890 --> 01:39:37,300
This is Detective Arjun Khanna.

1215
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:38,720
Counter Terrorism Command.

1216
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:41,340
The train bomber has
been spotted in your hospital.

1217
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:43,700
Yes. The train bomber has
been spotted in your hospital.

1218
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:47,720
I want you to lock all your doors,
exits, anything to get of here.

1219
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:50,010
Nobody moves out of the
hospital till the police comes.

1220
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,890
Come with me, I want to
see his face. - Sorry?

1221
01:39:53,090 --> 01:39:54,870
I mean I want you to identify him.

1222
01:39:55,130 --> 01:39:56,590
I want you to identify him.
Please come with me.

1223
01:39:56,670 --> 01:39:57,670
Okay.

1224
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:50,620
Please calm down.

1225
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:55,210
All of you please calm down.

1226
01:41:06,970 --> 01:41:07,970
There he is.

1227
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:11,330
He's gone that way.

1228
01:41:58,210 --> 01:41:59,210
Police.

1229
01:42:01,630 --> 01:42:02,630
Come out.

1230
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:08,540
No.

1231
01:42:09,150 --> 01:42:10,150
Open the boot.

1232
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:21,100
Sorry.

1233
01:43:03,150 --> 01:43:04,170
CTC.
- Sir.

1234
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:05,720
This is Anne.

1235
01:43:05,950 --> 01:43:08,220
She has seen the suspect
and she'll be able to identify him.

1236
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:11,400
I want every person, every car,
every boot to be checked, now.

1237
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:12,700
Yes, sir.
- Yes.

1238
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,200
Yes, Vikas?

1239
01:43:16,050 --> 01:43:17,560
Sir, there are some
Air India tickets booked...

1240
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:18,670
...under Aakash Rana's name.

1241
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:19,900
The flight leaves at eight.

1242
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:21,720
Some Nikita Rana and
a child are with him.

1243
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:23,300
Where are you at the moment?

1244
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:24,570
I'm going to the headquarters, sir.

1245
01:43:24,650 --> 01:43:26,040
Go to the airport, right away.

1246
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:27,760
And go directly to
the check-in counter.

1247
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:30,740
And see to it that no one boards
the flight using those tickets.

1248
01:43:30,890 --> 01:43:32,460
Are you listening? I'm on my way.

1249
01:43:43,850 --> 01:43:45,930
So, we went up to look
at the security cameras.

1250
01:43:46,010 --> 01:43:47,520
Then we came down here...

1251
01:44:02,590 --> 01:44:03,590
Sir.

1252
01:44:06,310 --> 01:44:07,380
So far no man named Aakash Rana...

1253
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:08,600
...has showed up
at the check-in counter.

1254
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:09,910
Now the counter has closed, sir.

1255
01:44:09,990 --> 01:44:12,140
And there is no booking
on this name on any other flight.

1256
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:23,830
Thoroughly crosscheck any
Indian or Asian you come across.

1257
01:44:23,910 --> 01:44:24,910
Sir.

1258
01:44:26,710 --> 01:44:29,150
Did you get any
photo or ID of Aakash?

1259
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:31,290
That will take a little time, sir.

1260
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:33,910
Immigration department will send
us a photo as soon as they find it.

1261
01:44:43,230 --> 01:44:45,270
If he isn't taking flight then...

1262
01:44:45,950 --> 01:44:48,050
...there is only one way
to get out of this country.

1263
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:50,060
When does the train to Paris leave?

1264
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:53,090
Sir, I think, the last train
leaves in an hour and a half.

1265
01:44:55,620 --> 01:44:57,040
He has made a fool out of us.

1266
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:58,430
Come on, let's go.

1267
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:20,670
'The letter that you had
kept for us in Delhi Darbar... '

1268
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:22,630
'... got burnt
with the restaurant.'

1269
01:45:22,770 --> 01:45:24,300
'We are making an appeal.'

1270
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:28,820
'Call us for the last time and tell
us, how do we disarm this bomb.'

1271
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:31,170
'This is an appeal.
Thank you. That's it.'

1272
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:36,870
Sir, the ministry has sent orders.

1273
01:45:37,020 --> 01:45:39,150
We'll have to stop the
train at Glasgow station.

1274
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:44,170
Sir, according to them,
they have got the station vacated.

1275
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:46,800
And a 90 Members Rescue team is
also provided there.

1276
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,000
This is not possible.
They have lost their mind.

1277
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:51,230
The train cannot enter
the station at this speed.

1278
01:45:51,310 --> 01:45:53,090
Anyway,
if the speed goes below 60...

1279
01:45:53,170 --> 01:45:55,120
...the bomb will explode
before it reaches the station.

1280
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:57,190
No, sir.
They aren't reducing the speed.

1281
01:45:57,350 --> 01:45:59,260
They want the train
to crash against...

1282
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:01,480
...the break-ribbons and
sandbags at the speed of 60.

1283
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:03,310
Sir, the fire brigades
is already there.

1284
01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:05,780
They have also started
spraying the anti-fire chemicals.

1285
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:08,630
Doctors, paramedics, police.
Everyone is on standby.

1286
01:46:09,230 --> 01:46:11,530
Even the passengers are being
shifted to the last compartment.

1287
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:13,540
That will kill more
than half the people.

1288
01:46:13,620 --> 01:46:16,080
Sir, they say that at least
some people will get saved.

1289
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:17,910
This is ridiculous.
This is stupidity.

1290
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:19,250
Sir, it's him.

1291
01:46:21,450 --> 01:46:22,400
Yes. Sanjay.

1292
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:23,690
There is no bomb on the train.

1293
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:24,960
You can stop the train.

1294
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:26,450
No, no. you are lying.

1295
01:46:27,610 --> 01:46:28,970
Bomb squad has confirmed it.

1296
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:31,120
I saw the bombs under the train.

1297
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:34,130
Yes, there are.
But they aren't activated.

1298
01:46:35,930 --> 01:46:38,840
I had written the same in the letter
I had send to the restaurant.

1299
01:46:39,380 --> 01:46:42,660
Listen, please, don't play
with the lives of innocent people.

1300
01:46:42,990 --> 01:46:44,650
I cannot say anything
more than that.

1301
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,030
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1302
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:50,790
The bomber just called.

1303
01:46:51,090 --> 01:46:52,940
He said that the bombs are
fake and that they won't go off.

1304
01:46:53,020 --> 01:46:54,020
He is a liar.

1305
01:46:55,410 --> 01:46:56,990
We can't take that chance.

1306
01:46:58,210 --> 01:47:01,650
We follow the ministry's orders
and stop the train at Glasgow only.

1307
01:47:01,780 --> 01:47:02,920
To hell with the orders.

1308
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:04,780
I am stopping the train right now.

1309
01:47:05,010 --> 01:47:08,250
You cannot override the ministry.
You understand!

1310
01:47:08,330 --> 01:47:09,510
Oh yes, I can.

1311
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:11,530
I'm in-charge here.
These are my people.

1312
01:47:11,610 --> 01:47:13,530
And they will do exactly
what I tell them to do.

1313
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:18,540
But sir, why do you trust him?

1314
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:22,810
Had he been a liar,
he wouldn't have called.

1315
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:24,480
What?

1316
01:47:25,610 --> 01:47:28,830
He wouldn't have
called if it's a lie.

1317
01:47:30,140 --> 01:47:31,310
If this goes wrong...

1318
01:47:34,190 --> 01:47:36,100
...you are going down for life.

1319
01:47:37,230 --> 01:47:38,230
John...

1320
01:47:39,430 --> 01:47:40,490
...Stop the train.

1321
01:47:55,370 --> 01:47:56,370
Hello?

1322
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:58,200
I will wait for you at the station.

1323
01:47:59,570 --> 01:48:00,570
I hope you come.

1324
01:48:02,820 --> 01:48:03,820
Yes, I'm coming.

1325
01:48:44,670 --> 01:48:45,670
Yes?

1326
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:49,530
Are you... Nikita Rana?

1327
01:48:50,060 --> 01:48:51,060
Yes?

1328
01:49:27,210 --> 01:49:28,490
Nikita, take a good look.

1329
01:49:29,030 --> 01:49:30,920
The lives of 500 people
now rests in your hands.

1330
01:49:31,450 --> 01:49:34,490
Inform me as soon as you spot him.

1331
01:49:47,490 --> 01:49:48,490
Excuse me.

1332
01:49:50,710 --> 01:49:51,670
He's here.

1333
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:52,750
Okay, good.

1334
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:54,390
Move closer to him.

1335
01:49:55,580 --> 01:49:56,580
Go to him.

1336
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:00,480
Authorities have confirmed
that the bomb on...

1337
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:02,830
...the Glasgow bound
train 112 was a hoax.

1338
01:50:03,380 --> 01:50:06,510
The high tension ordeal
which lasted 14 hours today...

1339
01:50:06,650 --> 01:50:07,880
...has finally ended.

1340
01:50:08,270 --> 01:50:10,870
There were no reports
of causalities as passengers...

1341
01:50:10,950 --> 01:50:13,510
...started disembarking
the express train minutes earlier.

1342
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:17,300
There was no bomb
connected to the train.

1343
01:50:17,460 --> 01:50:18,650
Everyone's safe.

1344
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:22,390
All the passengers of 112 have
alighted from the train safely.

1345
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:41,430
Don't look at my site.

1346
01:50:52,030 --> 01:50:53,030
Nikita?

1347
01:50:53,450 --> 01:50:54,450
Nikita?

1348
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:58,340
Nikita, can you hear me? Nikita?

1349
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:15,700
Where is he?

1350
01:51:16,990 --> 01:51:18,510
I'm asking you, where is he?

1351
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:21,660
Please tell me where is he.

1352
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:23,310
Sorry, that wasn't Aakash.

1353
01:51:23,390 --> 01:51:24,800
What do you mean he wasn't Aakash?

1354
01:51:24,950 --> 01:51:26,890
He wasn't Aakash but someone else.

1355
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:28,590
I know you saw him.

1356
01:51:28,810 --> 01:51:29,900
I saw you looking at him.

1357
01:51:29,980 --> 01:51:31,620
Don't lie to me. Don't lie to me.

1358
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:33,510
You are the one lying to me.

1359
01:51:33,910 --> 01:51:35,240
You told me he's a bomber.

1360
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:38,360
Yes. Yes. He's a bomber.

1361
01:51:38,930 --> 01:51:41,110
And this is your only
chance to save the passengers.

1362
01:51:41,190 --> 01:51:42,590
Once again you are lying.

1363
01:51:42,870 --> 01:51:44,150
Everyone is safe.

1364
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:45,980
All the news channels
are showing it.

1365
01:51:46,060 --> 01:51:47,340
Someone was playing a prank.

1366
01:51:47,670 --> 01:51:49,960
And you want to punish
my husband for it?

1367
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:52,920
Just because if entered
this country illegally?

1368
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:55,840
Just because he wants
to meet his wife and child?

1369
01:51:57,910 --> 01:51:59,310
Why are you not getting this?

1370
01:51:59,610 --> 01:52:01,260
He is a criminal
according to the law.

1371
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:03,040
And you are helping a criminal.

1372
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:05,550
Your law has given
a very harsh punishment.

1373
01:52:06,310 --> 01:52:08,120
He just wanted to help people.

1374
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:11,730
Do you have any idea
how many lives and families...

1375
01:52:11,810 --> 01:52:13,920
...has your law ruined?

1376
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:16,240
Let him go.

1377
01:52:16,610 --> 01:52:18,400
He wants to leave
this place for good.

1378
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:20,510
I won't let that happen.

1379
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,310
I will arrest him.

1380
01:52:22,470 --> 01:52:23,470
It's my duty.

1381
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:26,200
You... you...
- I cannot help you in it.

1382
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:28,600
You can find him on your own.

1383
01:52:29,310 --> 01:52:30,310
Please.

1384
01:52:30,890 --> 01:52:33,070
Please. Please try to help me.

1385
01:52:33,830 --> 01:52:34,830
No.

1386
01:52:46,890 --> 01:52:47,890
Daddy.

1387
01:52:52,470 --> 01:52:54,570
No. No. That's not him.

1388
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:56,550
That's not Aakash.

1389
01:52:57,770 --> 01:52:58,930
That's not him.

1390
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:02,540
That's not him. No.

1391
01:54:03,140 --> 01:54:06,530
The bomber is on level one.
Send back up immediately.

1392
01:55:41,070 --> 01:55:42,160
Can I go now?

1393
01:55:43,690 --> 01:55:44,770
You have go...

1394
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:47,700
But to a prison.

1395
01:55:52,430 --> 01:55:53,950
Surrender yourself.

1396
01:55:57,230 --> 01:55:58,810
You don't have a choice.

1397
01:55:59,060 --> 01:56:00,390
I still have a choice.

1398
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,220
Don't compel me.

1399
01:56:03,310 --> 01:56:04,370
You are a criminal.

1400
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:08,000
You cannot escape your punishment.

1401
01:56:08,310 --> 01:56:10,780
You don't need to be a
criminal to endure a punishment.

1402
01:56:12,370 --> 01:56:14,050
It's the same even
if you are innocent.

1403
01:56:14,810 --> 01:56:15,980
What wrong had I done?

1404
01:56:16,950 --> 01:56:18,880
I tried to fulfill
a dream of a good life...

1405
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:20,480
...through hard work and honesty.

1406
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:22,660
It was called cheating. A fraud.

1407
01:56:23,030 --> 01:56:24,660
I helped the ones in need.

1408
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:26,770
It was called sabotage. A murder.

1409
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:29,840
When I married the one I loved,
it was called rape.

1410
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:31,890
Yet I got punished.

1411
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:34,370
Everyone was taken away from me.

1412
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:37,600
My wife, my child,
my friends, my hopes, my future.

1413
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:38,680
Everything.

1414
01:56:41,990 --> 01:56:43,820
You, too,
must be having a wife, a child.

1415
01:56:44,510 --> 01:56:45,510
Ask your heart...

1416
01:56:46,610 --> 01:56:48,720
...what would have you
done had you been in my place?

1417
01:56:50,820 --> 01:56:52,710
And still,
if you think that I am wrong...

1418
01:56:54,100 --> 01:56:55,230
...then take the gun.

1419
01:56:55,620 --> 01:56:56,620
And shoot me.

1420
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:02,150
I am going, to my child.

1421
01:57:03,580 --> 01:57:07,280
I want to hug him and
sleep one night peacefully.

1422
01:57:10,350 --> 01:57:11,370
No.

1423
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:34,820
'We had a lot of dreams
which stayed as dreams.'

1424
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:39,650
'There was love,
thank God, it stayed intact.'

1425
01:57:41,970 --> 01:57:43,430
'If you are reading this
letter then it's certain...'

1426
01:57:43,510 --> 01:57:45,310
'... that I've gone
very far away from you.'

1427
01:57:46,390 --> 01:57:48,290
'One man made a mistake
and two had to suffer.'

1428
01:57:51,210 --> 01:57:54,350
'One man made a mistake
and two had to suffer.'

1429
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:58,220
'For all my mistakes and
all the promises I didn't keep...'

1430
01:57:58,570 --> 01:57:59,670
'Please forgive me.'

1431
01:58:00,220 --> 01:58:01,760
'And do me two favors.'

1432
01:58:02,590 --> 01:58:04,420
'Tell Aakash that his father was ...

1433
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:06,800
...a good man caught
up in a bad situation.'

1434
01:58:07,450 --> 01:58:10,200
'Who died fighting for
his love and his right.'

1435
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:16,160
'And secondly, there is a
cheque enclosed with this letter.'

1436
01:58:16,890 --> 01:58:20,760
'Send half the amount to Megha's
brother and Aadil's mother.'

1437
01:58:21,940 --> 01:58:23,720
'And if we meet again
in the next life... '

1438
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:27,620
'... I promise, that story
will have a beautiful ending.'

1439
01:58:28,860 --> 01:58:29,860
'Until then... '

1440
01:58:30,940 --> 01:58:31,940
'I love you.'

1441
01:59:10,580 --> 01:59:16,090
"The road was leading ahead."

1442
01:59:16,730 --> 01:59:22,470
"There was danger behind."

1443
01:59:29,140 --> 01:59:34,670
"The road was leading ahead."

1444
01:59:35,330 --> 01:59:40,550
"There was danger behind."

1445
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:47,120
"Speedy sight said..."

1446
01:59:47,700 --> 01:59:52,500
"...the one who got
scared was destroyed."

1447
01:59:52,930 --> 01:59:55,760
"It goes on fast and faster."

1448
01:59:56,050 --> 01:59:59,030
"The game to fear of fear goes on."

1449
01:59:59,190 --> 02:00:04,680
"Everybody wants to win the race."

1450
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,160
"Play with speed."

1451
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:15,490
"Everybody... speed, speed, speed..."

1452
02:00:18,830 --> 02:00:20,580
"Everybody plays."

1453
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:27,950
"Speed, speed, speed..."

1454
02:00:53,890 --> 02:00:56,860
"Somewhere it is linked
and somewhere it turns."

1455
02:00:57,020 --> 02:00:59,860
"The road is broken at places."

1456
02:00:59,940 --> 02:01:03,020
"The land is lost.
The world is lost."

1457
02:01:03,210 --> 02:01:06,220
"Relationships are lost."

1458
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:11,430
"Life does not stop."

1459
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:17,940
"Life does not stop."

1460
02:01:18,020 --> 02:01:21,120
"It goes on fast and faster."

1461
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:24,110
"The game to fear of fear goes on."

1462
02:01:24,280 --> 02:01:29,480
"Everybody wants to win the race."

1463
02:01:29,560 --> 02:01:34,650
"Play with speed."

1464
02:01:35,140 --> 02:01:39,180
"Everybody... speed, speed, speed..."
