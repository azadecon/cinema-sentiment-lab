1
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,270
O Lord Ganesha,
of Curved Trunk, Large Body

2
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,270
and with the
Brilliance of a Million Suns

3
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,180
Please make all my work

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,890
Free of obstacles, always

5
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,680
'Before becoming doctors,
we have to take an oath.'

6
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,890
'It's called a Hippocratic oath.'

7
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,930
'There are some vows like
always supporting truth.'

8
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,680
'We will consider each
life precious and respect it.'

9
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,720
'We will consider our patients
more important than ourselves.'

10
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,770
'It's easy to take oaths.'

11
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,600
'But it's very difficult
to adhere to the oaths.'

12
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,220
'And our story
begins at that crossroad.'

13
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,310
'Dr. Asthana was our
country's most famous..'

14
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,310
'..and the best general surgeon.'

15
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,060
'People call him God of Surgery.'

16
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,520
'And I used to
consider him my mentor.'

17
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,930
'And to learn surgery from him..'

18
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,520
'..I was doing my internship
in Shekhawat General Hospital.'

19
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,890
Sir, who is this celebrity patient?

20
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,850
The entire media has
gathered here to cover his news.

21
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,390
He is Laxman Gagal.
- Gagal?

22
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,140
Gagal who is one of
top 100 business tycoons?

23
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,310
Yes.

24
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,930
What has happened to him?
- Accident.

25
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,890
What the hell is happening here?

26
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,020
This is not a Goddamn circus!

27
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,140
Move back!
- Get OR2 prepped up.

28
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,720
Dr. Riya.
- Yes, sir.

29
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,640
You will be with the patient,
Dr. Romesh. - Sir.

30
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,350
Hi, doctor. My name is Amit Gagal.
That's my father.

31
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,810
Amit Gagal, there are three things.

32
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,810
Keep your family away from me.

33
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,520
Don't ask me about
the patient's wellbeing repeatedly.

34
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,720
I will get irritated.

35
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,020
And thirdly, I am the best.

36
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,220
No one can save your
father besides me.

37
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,680
Is that clear? Out.

38
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,520
Nurse.

39
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,600
Sir, the heart rate is going down.

40
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,810
Sir, it has dropped to 60.

41
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,970
BP is low?
- Sir, it's 90.

42
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,680
Nurse, get me the drip fast.

43
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,930
Doctor, he is sinking.
- Just five minutes. I am almost done.

44
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,890
Sir, heart rate has dropped to 40.

45
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,270
Intracardiac adrenaline, Dr. Romesh.

46
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,680
Here, sir.

47
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,930
Nurse, quickly.

48
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,220
Sir.
- Jab it between third and fourth rib.

49
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,890
Sir, straight in the heart?

50
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,720
Jab it now. We are
losing him. Come on.

51
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,680
What are you thinking?
Jab it now. Come on.

52
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,100
Jab it..

53
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,350
Who allowed you in
the operation theatre? Damn it.

54
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,270
Give it to me. Get out.

55
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,470
Oh, God! His BP has gone down to 55.

56
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,720
Atropine 100.

57
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,220
His BP is going down, doctor.

58
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,470
His BP is going down.

59
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,720
Atropine, one ampoule, nurse. Now.

60
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,930
Quick, nurse.

61
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,350
Heart rate is down to 20, sir.

62
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,140
Pulse is down. Doctor, Bradycardia.

63
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,810
Nurse, give it to me.

64
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,770
Charge to 200.

65
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,970
Charged.

66
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,520
Sir! Sir! Sir!

67
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,720
Hold on! Hold on!
- How is he, sir?

68
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,560
Mr. Gagal had multiple rib
fractures and ruptured spleen.

69
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,470
The operation was successful.
He is in the ICU.

70
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,180
Under observation.

71
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,970
He will be alright soon. Thank you.
- Sir, when will Mr. Gagal..

72
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,520
..be able to resume his normal life?
- Sir! Sir! Sir!

73
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,140
Sir, for how long will
he be in the hospital?

74
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,810
Sir! Sir, I am very sorry about
what happened in the OT today.

75
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,310
Stay in the ICU with Mr. Gagal.

76
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,470
If there is any emergency,
press the code blue button.

77
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,140
Yes, sir.

78
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,430
You couldn't jab an injection.

79
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,060
I hope you will be
able to press a button.

80
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,770
Sir, I am..

81
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,180
Hey, you!

82
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,310
You have still not gone to sleep?

83
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,180
It's 6:30 in the morning.

84
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,560
It's 11 in Sidney.
It's a live match. How can I sleep?

85
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,890
How come you are
suddenly interested in cricket?

86
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,310
Some cute new cricketer?

87
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,390
Just you.

88
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,270
It's okay.

89
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,060
I know that you are
upset that I am upset. But...

90
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,060
What Dr. Asthana said was right.

91
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,930
I did freeze.

92
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,390
I don't know what had happened to me.

93
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,930
It's okay. It happens.

94
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,180
It was our first surgery.

95
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,810
And...in this situation many
experienced doctors also tremble.

96
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,350
That's why we are interns.

97
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,680
So that we can face such kind
of situations and pressures.

98
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,270
As it is, it's not easy to jab
an injection into someone's lungs.

99
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,720
Especially if he is
a famous celebrity.

100
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,430
It means, I am a good
human being and a bad doctor.

101
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,560
Only a good human
being can be a good doctor.

102
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,930
By the way, a good
human being, a good doctor.

103
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,060
Now be a good lover too.

104
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:06,720
"Let my slow
heartbeats in your heart rise."

105
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:18,390
"Let your sweet fragrance
on my breath intensify."

106
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:25,390
"Let's unravel
all the knots of the heart."

107
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:31,970
"Let's leave our dreams
under the care of the breeze."

108
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,390
"Come on. Let's live a little."

109
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,390
"Let's relish a bit of the sky."

110
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,180
"Let's break the ground."

111
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,810
"Let's destroy the world in love."

112
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,770
"Come on. Let's live a little."

113
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,720
"Let's relish a bit of the sky."

114
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,600
"Let's break the ground."

115
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,100
"Let's destroy the world in love."

116
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,640
I had lunch. Yes.
- How are your studies going on?

117
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,140
My studies are also going on fine.
- Riya.

118
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,600
Riya, where is my underwear?

119
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,180
Listen, Riya..
- Tell me.

120
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,270
Papa, I will call you back.
I can't hear your voice.

121
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,470
Bye.
- Hello.

122
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,470
Romesh, what are you doing?
It was papa's call.

123
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,810
He doesn't know we live together.

124
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,770
I am a small town girl.
I am not a foreigner.

125
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,140
Okay. Fine. But where
did you keep my underwear?

126
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,140
Here. Here.

127
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:33,020
"My eyes got familiar with yours."

128
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,140
"Similar."

129
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:45,430
"Your eyes matched mine similarly."

130
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,520
"It's your effect.
- Your effect."

131
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,770
"I am impatient.
- Impatient."

132
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,770
"It's your prayer."

133
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,640
"I am obvious to everyone."

134
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,560
"Come on. Let's live a little."

135
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,600
"Let's relish a bit of the sky."

136
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,390
"Let's break the ground."

137
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,970
"Let's destroy the world in love."

138
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,970
"Come on. Let's live a little."

139
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,180
"Let's relish a bit of the sky."

140
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,720
"Let's break the ground."

141
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:23,310
"Let's destroy the world in love."

142
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,810
He doesn't need any introduction.

143
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,430
He is as important for us
as Sachin is for cricket.

144
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,560
Hi. - If Dr. Asthana
had not been with us..

145
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,520
..we wouldn't have got funds
for the new pediatric ward.

146
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,720
Now I would like Dr.
Asthana to say a few words.

147
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,640
What do I say?
He has made me Tendulkar.

148
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,600
But he is also as
important for our hospital..

149
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,310
..as BCCI is for our
Indian cricket team.

150
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,220
We can neither live with
him nor live without him.

151
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,600
Yes?

152
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,140
Hello.
- Hi, doctor.

153
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,970
Doctor, this is my son Ankur.

154
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,310
Since last night he
has a severe stomachache.

155
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,560
I don't know what it is.

156
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,060
Come, son. Come here.

157
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,220
Come.

158
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,270
Sit.

159
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,430
Any vomiting?

160
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,270
No. He didn't vomit.
He said he feels like vomiting.

161
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,270
But he didn't vomit.
- Okay.

162
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,470
I gave him a painkiller.

163
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,520
But it didn't make any difference.
- Okay.

164
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,220
Mrs..
- Nandita. You can call me Nandita.

165
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,680
Nandita, I can't be sure just now.

166
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,680
But this could be appendicitis.

167
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,270
I think it might be better
if you admit him for tonight.

168
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,970
But doctor, how come
suddenly appendicitis?

169
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,310
I mean.. - No. No. No.
This is not a serious situation.

170
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,060
It's a very common problem.

171
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,560
Actually, appendix is
that part of our body..

172
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,770
..without which we
can easily function.

173
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,020
For instance, tonsils.

174
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,720
We call it vestigial organs.

175
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,770
Like a tail?
- Yeah. Like a tail.

176
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,470
The only problem is that
for 100% confirmation..

177
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,390
..we will have to get
his sonography done.

178
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,310
And that's possible
only tomorrow morning.

179
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,430
So I think its better that you
let him stay here for tonight.

180
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,390
Because if he is in pain at home..

181
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,970
..it will just get difficult.

182
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,720
Fine.

183
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,270
I will get him admitted.
- Okay. Very good.

184
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,850
Don't be scared.

185
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,680
Excuse me.
- Yes, sir.

186
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,020
Ankur Arora is in which room?

187
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,390
On the second floor, room number 201.
- Thank you.

188
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,640
Welcome.

189
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,970
What are you doing here? - The question
is what are you doing here?

190
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,720
What the hell is happening?

191
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,350
And suddenly, what happened to Ankur?

192
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,890
The doctor thinks it is appendicitis.

193
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,100
He said to admit him. Or else
there might be some complication.

194
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,970
So I got him admitted.

195
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,220
Good. But you didn't
call me up. That's not good.

196
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,060
I would have come with you.
- Actually, it was very late.

197
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,600
I didn't want to disturb you.

198
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,770
Now you are being really formal.

199
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,430
You are not just my employee,
but also my friend.

200
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,970
You should have called me up.

201
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,270
You know, I am always there for you.

202
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,020
Sit.

203
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,770
Sandwich.

204
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,060
I am not hungry.
- Eat.

205
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,430
Look, eat. Otherwise acidity and
all that nonsense will happen.

206
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,970
Along with the kid, we will
have to admit the mother too.

207
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,220
Do you know? Since morning he was
telling me he has a stomachache.

208
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,850
I thought he was making an excuse..

209
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,140
..so that he doesn't
have to go to school.

210
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,270
I am so stupid.

211
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,770
So stupid.

212
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,810
Ankur.

213
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,140
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

214
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,310
You kept telling me the whole day.

215
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,680
I couldn't understand.

216
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,350
You must have been in
a lot of pain, right?

217
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,060
You were in pain, weren't you?

218
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,890
Mama is so stupid.

219
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,470
Mama, don't worry. I am okay.

220
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,270
It's not paining now. I am fine, mom.

221
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,310
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

222
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,430
I am so sorry.

223
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,180
Who is the next patient?
- Ankur Arora, sir.

224
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,270
Good morning, doctor.
My name is Nandita Arora. And..

225
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,180
Who admitted him?
- Me, sir.

226
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,970
The patient was in pain
and complaining of nausea.

227
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,770
I had a doubt it is appendicitis.

228
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,270
So I thought it's better to admit him.

229
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,970
Did you do sonography?
- No, sir.

230
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,560
So how do you know its appendicitis?

231
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,470
It could be ureteric stones.

232
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,220
Sir, he was complaining
of stomachache. So I..

233
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,430
It could be intussusception.

234
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,180
Sir, there was no
complaint of blood in the stool.

235
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,930
And the pain was also not severe.

236
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,970
Viral gastroenteritis.

237
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,100
Sir, there was no fever.
And no diarrhea also.

238
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,850
Your diagnosis is right.

239
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,890
Your decision of
admitting him is also right.

240
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,560
Get CT scan done.
We will know the level of infection.

241
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,890
Yes, sir.
- Are you his mother?

242
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,640
You shouldn't ignore appendicitis.
It's not good.

243
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,520
We might have to operate him
once we get the scan reports.

244
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,560
The OT is not available today.

245
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,100
So the operation will
take place tomorrow.

246
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,430
As such, the pain is less.
So, no problem.

247
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,140
Whatever you think
is fine. And if you..

248
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,430
Sir, actually, OT is available today.

249
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,600
OT is not available today.

250
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,140
No, sir. There was a
gallbladder surgery.

251
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,270
It has been canceled. So..
- OT is not available today.

252
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,470
The operation will
take place tomorrow.

253
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,680
Don't you do that to me ever again.

254
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,220
Don't try to cut me off in front
of my patient. - Sir, I was just..

255
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,020
When I am saying OT is not available..

256
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,180
..it means OT is not available.

257
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,470
Sir, I was informed that the
surgery has been cancelled.

258
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,270
So I thought of informing you.
- Dr. Romesh.

259
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,310
I know the surgery has been cancelled.

260
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,930
I know OT is available.

261
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,140
But the kid will stay
here tonight. You know why?

262
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,350
Because I am saying it.

263
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,220
Simple.

264
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,560
If you want to be a
successful doctor, remember that..

265
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,470
..along with being a profession,
it's a business too.

266
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,560
You need money for treatment.

267
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,100
These modern machines,
medicines, staff..

268
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,270
..hasn't come free.

269
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,430
It has been bought with money.

270
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,180
To run the hospital you need
money and not just goodness.

271
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,470
Without money, there
will be no hospitals.

272
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,060
Without hospital, no treatment.

273
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,310
If you sympathize
with them, tell them..

274
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,430
..to stop going to expensive
beauty parlors for a month.

275
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,680
They will save money.

276
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,100
If she can't even do
this for her son..

277
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,770
..then she shouldn't
expect anything from us.

278
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,930
One patient's money comes
to another patient's aid.

279
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,350
So they bloody well
pay for each other.

280
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,600
Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

281
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,060
Do you understand, Dr. Romesh?

282
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,310
I am asking you, Dr. Romesh.
Do you understand?

283
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,810
Sir, we understand. We all understand.

284
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,770
What you are saying makes sense.

285
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:23,310
Try to understand.
Learn something from her.

286
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,970
Take it easy.

287
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,640
Hey, champ. You okay in there?

288
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,970
Yeah. Okay.

289
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,850
I am not scared.

290
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,270
Good.

291
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,100
Shall I ask you a question?

292
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,470
Sure. - Can people die
during asendipitis operation?

293
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,520
Its not asendipitis.
It's appendicitis.

294
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,220
And, no. No one dies
in this operation.

295
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,770
They just survive.

296
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,350
And we won't let you die.

297
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,180
Are you sure?
- Very sure.

298
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:21,720
Is it just appendix?
Or any other complication?

299
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,180
Only appendicitis.

300
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,060
But if you and Dr. Asthana want..

301
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,850
..we can conduct many more tests.

302
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,810
So that this hospital can do business.

303
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:36,970
Romesh, I was just..
- You understand everything.

304
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,140
I am getting bored.

305
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,680
For how long will I have to lie down?

306
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,520
Just 10 minutes more, champ.

307
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,390
Shall I tell you something?

308
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,390
But don't tell mom.

309
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,810
Sure. I am an expert
in keeping secrets.

310
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:06,220
You see, I don't feel
good that I am sick.

311
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,020
Because mom is sad because of me.

312
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,310
She was already sad.

313
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,220
And...and she is sadder now.

314
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,770
Don't worry. You will be fine.

315
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,220
She thinks I don't know anything.

316
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,890
I am a kid.

317
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,020
But I am not a kid.

318
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,680
I know papa has left us forever.

319
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,020
I even know that mom
doesn't cry in front of me.

320
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,430
She cries alone in her bedroom.

321
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,850
Make me alright. I will earn a
lot of money once I grow up.

322
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,600
Only for mom.

323
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,390
I will buy many presents for her.

324
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,930
I will always keep her happy.

325
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,970
I won't leave her like papa.

326
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,970
Romesh, it's not fair.

327
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,310
You are venting out
Asthana's anger on me.

328
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,850
I was just easing the tension
between Dr. Asthana and you.

329
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,180
That's all. It was really
getting out of control.

330
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,100
Do you know, Riya?

331
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,680
When I was small,
my mother used to tell me..

332
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,220
..when a person's courage wanes..

333
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,770
..he becomes more cunning.

334
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,970
And when I was small,
my mother had also told me.

335
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,720
Instead of unnecessary bravery,
it's better to keep quiet.

336
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,770
Fight only when you can fight.

337
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,390
Not when you don't
have the power to fight.

338
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,970
Tomorrow, Dr. Asthana
won't let me come in the OT..

339
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,390
..for Ankur's operation.

340
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,890
Take care of the kid.

341
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,930
Please.

342
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,270
I will.

343
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,140
And now, will you
break your oath of silence?

344
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,970
I love you.

345
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,020
That's the problem.

346
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,270
I love you too.

347
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,770
Mama...I am hungry.

348
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,600
You can't eat now, Ankur.

349
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,970
Your operation is after an hour, son.

350
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,890
Come on. Be a brave boy.

351
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,970
Eat later.

352
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,560
You are mama's brave boy.

353
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,930
Okay?

354
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,890
Good morning, Ankur.
- Hi.

355
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,060
Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.

356
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,220
Ma'am, this is a list
for the surgical kit.

357
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,930
You have to buy it
from the surgical shop.

358
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,890
The unused items will be returned.

359
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,270
Will you get it if I pay you money?

360
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,270
We don't have anyone else here.

361
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,930
I am sorry, ma'am.

362
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,140
Actually, the hospital staff
is not allowed to take money.

363
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,680
And I think it won't take you long.

364
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,270
The shop is not crowded in
the morning. That's why.

365
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,220
Bye, Ankur. Thank you, ma'am.
- Bye.

366
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,100
You will be okay?

367
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,770
I will get it and be back soon.

368
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,020
Send your Gina that yap yap thing.

369
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,060
Whatsapp, mom.

370
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,310
Whatsapp.

371
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,720
Okay. I got it.

372
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,100
Whatsapp.
- Whatsapp.

373
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,140
Carefully. Careful. Careful.

374
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,520
You are not scared, are you?
- No, mom.

375
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,930
The doctors will take care of you.

376
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,390
And uncle Ajay will take care of you.

377
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:30,560
Naughty. - Of course I will.
And that's a promise.

378
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,020
Stop it.

379
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,100
Bye, mom.
- Bye, son.

380
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,350
See you, champ.

381
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,220
Good morning, Ankur.

382
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,680
Your stomach is empty, right?

383
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,100
You didn't eat anything
in the morning, did you?

384
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,100
No.
- Very good.

385
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:55,890
Nurse, take this.

386
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,430
Nurse.

387
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:06,430
Actually, when mom went down,
I was very hungry.

388
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,930
So I ate a few biscuits.

389
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,930
Don't tell mom.

390
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,390
Or else she will be very angry.

391
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,180
Excuse me, sir.
- Yes. It's a black diamond, sir..

392
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,060
Sir, the appendicitis
patient Ankur Arora.. - What?

393
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,890
He is not MBM, sir.
- What?

394
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,720
Sir, that patient Ankur Arora..

395
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:29,680
..ate a few biscuits. Sir,
his stomach is not empty.

396
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:32,560
I can't postpone the operation
because of a few biscuits, Rosina.

397
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,890
There is a queue for operations.

398
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,020
But sir, the operation is
scheduled within an hour. - Yes..

399
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,100
So I will use ryles tube.
Why is that used?

400
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:42,390
Sir, to clear the patient's
stomach before the operation.

401
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,310
Exactly. It will be done. Now go.

402
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,770
Yes. No. My wife is not coming.

403
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,140
You can introduce me to anybody.

404
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,350
Of course.

405
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,020
Okay. Yeah. It's okay. Bye.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

406
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,770
Yes? - Sir, this is
standard disclaimer form.

407
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,020
A routine operation formality.
So ma'am has to sign here.

408
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,310
Just sign here.

409
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,020
We are ready, sir.
- Good.

410
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,430
Is everything okay, sir?

411
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,770
I am forgetting something.

412
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,930
I had to do something. What was that?

413
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,770
Damn! My phone.

414
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,140
Remove it.

415
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,020
Switch it off.
- Sir.

416
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,520
Scalpel please.

417
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,180
Dr. Romesh.

418
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,470
What are you doing here?

419
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,390
I thought you would be in the surgery.

420
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,770
No. Actually,
I am just an intern here.

421
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,520
Dr. Asthana is
conducting the operation.

422
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,770
So nothing to worry about.
He is the best.

423
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,180
A good stitch, sir.

424
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,600
Thank you, Dr. Riya.

425
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,850
Thank you very much everybody.

426
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,390
Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir.

427
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,850
Doctor.
- Hello.

428
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,350
Ankur?
- Yes. He is alright.

429
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,640
He will regain consciousness soon.

430
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,560
Thank you.. - I have got the
email for the Geneva convention.

431
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,680
I will reply in two days.

432
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,560
Ankur, show me your tongue.

433
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,560
Show me your tongue.

434
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,060
Yes. Good.

435
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,270
Open your eyes.

436
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:21,810
Open your eyes. This too. Good boy.

437
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,520
Okay. Fine. Okay.

438
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,770
Oh, my God!

439
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,180
He is vomiting. He is aspirating.

440
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,810
Oh, God! Nurse,
suction machine. Quick.

441
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,020
Yes, sir.

442
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,020
Sir, his oxygen
saturation is dropping.

443
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,020
Oh, God! Quickly, nurse.

444
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,560
Nurse, call Dr. Asthana immediately.
- Yes, doctor.

445
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:57,020
Doctor. Dr. Asthana.
- Hold on.

446
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,720
Keep him under observation for two
more days. - Okay, sir. - Doctor.

447
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,930
Appendicitis patient
is aspirating in the OT.

448
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,930
Damn! Ryles tube! Damn!

449
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,220
I cannot see anything.
Give me the tool.

450
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,430
Okay.

451
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,890
Hold it. Oh, no! It is a mess.

452
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,100
What's going on?
- He aspirated, doctor.

453
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,930
Why didn't anyone tell me that he
ate something before the operation?

454
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:25,640
Intubator. - There is a lot of vomit.
Let me clean this first.

455
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,520
Sir, oxygen saturation is down to 60.

456
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,270
Just intubate him.
The oxygen is not reaching his brain.

457
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,810
Nurse, quick. Get the tube.

458
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,470
Give me the tube.
- Sir, oxygen saturation is down to 50.

459
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,560
I cannot see anything.
There is food all over.

460
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,270
You are not doing this
for the first time, doctor.

461
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,430
You have done this a thousand times.

462
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,600
Now don't disappoint me. Please.

463
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,430
I cannot see any damn thing, doctor.

464
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,470
Damn! Telescope.

465
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,770
Ventilator.

466
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,220
Saturation is down.

467
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,890
It's in. It's in.

468
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,180
The tube is in esophagus
and not in the trachea.

469
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,850
There is no way,
doctor. Come on. Take it out.

470
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,810
Oh, God!
- Saturation down to 35.

471
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,390
It's in the trachea now.

472
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,890
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

473
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,310
His reading, Dr. Riya?

474
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,430
Saturation is 110. Improving.

475
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,720
It's going up, sir.

476
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,890
Just check him please.
- What?

477
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,100
Just check the boy.

478
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,770
Ankur.

479
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,140
Ankur, open your eyes.

480
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:43,600
Ankur. Ankur, can you hear me?
Open your eyes, Ankur.

481
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,270
Ankur, open your eyes. Open your eyes.

482
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,970
Ankur, can you hear me? Ankur,
open your eyes.

483
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,270
Ankur, open your eyes. Ankur. Ankur.

484
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,720
He is not responding.

485
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,350
We have lost him.
- What?

486
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,180
He is in hypoxia.

487
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,470
He is in coma?

488
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,350
I messed up.

489
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:20,720
For the first time in
life...I have messed up.

490
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:23,970
What happened, doctor?

491
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,310
Rosina told me the
patient...ate a few biscuits..

492
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,390
..before the operation.

493
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,520
What!

494
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,720
I had to use Ryle's tube.

495
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,520
I forgot.

496
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,520
Damn!

497
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:04,220
Look...we are all doctors.

498
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:08,020
So...doctors support each other.

499
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:16,430
Whatever happened in the
operation theatre will remain here.

500
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:22,470
But, doctor..
- It's not just...my mistake...doctor.

501
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,140
You should have also checked.

502
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,390
But..
- Okay. Okay.

503
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,270
Whatever
happened...won't be disclosed.

504
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,310
Is that clear?

505
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,770
But Dr. Asthana, if someone asks us..

506
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,560
..how did the child slip into coma..

507
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,220
..why have we kept him on ventilator,
what will we say?

508
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:47,770
Yes. So...we will say
postoperative atelectasis.

509
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,890
His lung collapsed.

510
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,600
He couldn't breathe
during the operation.

511
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,180
His lung was collapsing. So we...

512
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,890
..kept him on ventilator.

513
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,310
But still he slipped into coma.

514
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,060
We can say that. We are doctors.

515
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,180
But..

516
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:15,470
You guys have to decide
whether you are with me or..

517
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,140
Because if you are not
with me, you are against me.

518
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:30,020
And after that your degrees,
experience, influence..

519
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,520
..won't come in handy.

520
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:39,220
You know that very well, doctor.

521
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,470
At least not in this country.

522
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,770
Nobody can touch me.

523
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:52,810
So don't look at me
like I am some criminal.

524
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,930
Okay? So it's clear. Okay? It's done.

525
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,060
You can leave please.

526
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,560
Riya, wait. No. You can go.

527
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,560
Inform his family.

528
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,720
Okay?

529
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,520
Do as I said.

530
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:32,890
Is that clear?

531
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,310
First let him be
discharged from the hospital.

532
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,140
I have no idea.

533
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,310
We will go. We will go. Okay, then..

534
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,390
I am not sure. Yes.
Maybe about a week.

535
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,850
Fine.

536
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,560
Yes.

537
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,720
I know you would love that.

538
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,220
Yes. Yes, doctor?

539
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,890
There is a complication.
- Complication?

540
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:21,930
Your son, after the
operation his lungs collapsed.

541
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,600
What?
- It doesn't usually happen.

542
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,270
But it's a rare case.

543
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,640
After the operation,
oxygen didn't reach his brain.

544
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,350
And he has slipped into coma.

545
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,390
We have kept him on ventilator.

546
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,600
And we are giving him antibiotics.

547
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,390
And we are shifting him to ICU soon.

548
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,640
Usually in such cases,
the patient comes out of coma..

549
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,060
..in a day or two.

550
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,560
Please don't worry.

551
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,140
Ankur is this
hospital's responsibility.

552
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,310
Just..

553
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:59,020
What is this? You
forgot the bag in the car?

554
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:09,600
Lalita..
- His mother..

555
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,720
How was it?

556
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,390
Coffee?

557
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,850
Here.
- Thanks.

558
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,270
What happened, Riya?

559
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,850
What happened? Is something wrong?

560
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,770
Riya, what's happened?

561
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,310
What?
- I don't feel good.

562
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,310
But, Riya..

563
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,970
He is in coma.
Because of lung collapse.

564
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,060
That's what the doctors are saying.

565
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,430
They will give him
strong antibiotics..

566
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,600
..shift him to ICU.

567
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,560
How did this happen?

568
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,640
Such a small kid is in coma.

569
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:35,140
Doctor, how serious is this?

570
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,810
It's serious.

571
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,390
Ajay!
- Yeah!

572
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,600
Ajay, I have read
Smith & Morison's contract.

573
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,310
Talk to them once. I think it is fine.

574
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,600
Read it once and then talk. Okay?

575
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,470
Talk to them. What are you doing?

576
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,680
You haven't slept since 24 hours.

577
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,680
Please go home and rest.

578
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,270
I am here with Ankur.
I will take care of him.

579
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,850
How will you take care?
How can you take care?

580
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:19,310
What does he want?
He doesn't need anything.

581
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,220
He can't ask for anything,
neither can he eat nor drink.

582
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,890
He doesn't need anything. He doesn't.

583
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,220
Neither friends nor mother.

584
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:31,930
Nandita, come on.

585
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,640
What are you doing? There is
a lot of office work pending.

586
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,020
So what if he is ill?
What can someone do?

587
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,180
What can someone do?

588
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,520
Life doesn't stop.
It goes on. It goes on.

589
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,720
Work goes on.

590
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,850
What difference does it make
whether someone is ill or..

591
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,520
Make the call. Talk to them.

592
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,310
Finalize the contract..

593
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:36,930
Yes, sir?

594
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,770
Nurse, please send Rosina.
- Yes.

595
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,310
What's the need to show
efficiency at the wrong place?

596
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:55,060
Why did you write that Ankur ate
something an hour before surgery?

597
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,100
But sir, I informed you..
- I know.

598
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,350
That's why I am telling you.

599
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,180
Now we will have to
increase the time span.

600
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,470
But why, sir? What happened?

601
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:19,270
I forgot to use Ryle's tube.
- Oh, my God, sir!

602
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,640
Sir, the kid Ankur..
- Is in coma.

603
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,600
And...sir, hospital rules.

604
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,930
To hell with the hospital rules.

605
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:40,140
Whose hospital is this?
- Mr. Shekhawat and yours, sir.

606
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:48,060
And whose job is it to uphold
the reputation of the hospital?

607
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,770
Yours, sir.
- That's what I am doing.

608
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,640
Let it be. Keep this money.

609
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:02,770
Return to your village or city
or wherever you have come from.

610
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,140
If there is an inquiry,
I will handle it.

611
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:08,520
Is this nine fine? Natural?

612
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,970
Yes, sir.
- Sure? Okay. Okay. Okay.

613
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:34,220
Nurse. Nurse, patient number
23 Ankur Arora..

614
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:35,680
..room number 104.

615
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:37,060
Which nurse was on duty?

616
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,390
Wait a minute, sir.
I will just check. - Yes. Please.

617
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,220
Please be quick.

618
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,970
Here. I have it, sir.
- Yes.

619
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,220
Nurse Rosina.
- Okay. Where is she right now?

620
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:56,600
Sir, I don't know. If her duty is over,
she will be at home.

621
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,270
Duty is over?
Her duty is till 9:00 p.m.

622
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:01,430
How can she just..
- I have no idea, sir.

623
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,020
But she has left for the day.

624
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,680
Where does Rosina live?

625
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,640
Upstairs. Room number 28. First floor.

626
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:40,970
Hey!

627
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,890
Riya.

628
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:55,970
What happened in the OT today?

629
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:01,060
Riya, what happened to Ankur?

630
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,310
I told you. His lungs collapsed.

631
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:07,270
I am not asking what lies
you are telling the world.

632
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,560
I am asking what actually happened.

633
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,310
The answer won't
change by asking repeatedly.

634
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,390
His lungs collapsed.
- Is it?

635
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:17,600
If his lungs collapsed,
why wasn't bronchoscopy advised?

636
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,770
Why was he
straightaway put on antibiotics?

637
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:21,890
No chest x-ray, no ABG analysis.

638
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,100
Straightaway magnamycin.

639
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,310
Please, Romesh. Not I, but Dr. Asthana
decides the line of treatment.

640
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,520
You guys are treating him
for aspiration pneumonia.

641
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,720
Because he vomited after
the operation. Yes or no?

642
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:32,640
No. It was a lung collapse.

643
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:34,850
Riya, look into my eyes.

644
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,100
Tell me the truth.
Just tell me what happened?

645
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,600
Romesh, please.
This isn't your problem.

646
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,310
This is my problem.
This is my problem.

647
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,640
I promised the kid that
nothing will happen to him.

648
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,890
And right now, he is in coma.

649
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:48,270
You are saying it isn't my problem.

650
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,390
Romesh, stop..
- Riya, just tell me.

651
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,140
After the operation,
did he vomit in the OT?

652
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:55,430
Romesh, stop it.
I told you what happened.

653
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,930
No, Riya. You are lying.
Who are you trying to save?

654
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:01,100
I am not lying.
I am not saving anyone.

655
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,850
Riya, we have become
doctors to save peoples' lives.

656
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:09,520
Not to run the hospital for business.

657
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,060
Our job is to end people's suffering.

658
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,640
And not be a cause of their suffering.

659
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:15,600
Today, a mother is questioning God.

660
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,100
Why is He doing this to her?

661
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,310
She doesn't know that
it's not God's fault.

662
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:23,220
It's the fault of those
people who are trying to be God.

663
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:28,850
Riya, please for
God's sake open the door.

664
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:30,350
And tell me the truth.

665
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,930
Please. I beg you.

666
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:45,810
"Why aren't you like your reflection?"

667
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:52,430
"Why isn't your
disposition like your face?"

668
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:04,680
"Why aren't you like your reflection?"

669
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:11,350
"Why isn't your
disposition like your face?"

670
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:14,930
"Why do faces change?"

671
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:18,100
"Why doesn't it support us?"

672
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:24,680
"Life, you are envious of my dreams."

673
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:27,890
"What kind of void is this?"

674
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,020
"It engulfs my heart."

675
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:37,060
"Your absence makes
me cry inconsolably."

676
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:43,270
"Why aren't you like your reflection?"

677
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:49,970
"Why isn't your
disposition like your face?"

678
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,270
You are not ready yet?
Shall we go home?

679
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:04,930
No. I am here today. I have some work.

680
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:17,220
It's tough.

681
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:27,930
"You have so many grievances from me."

682
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:34,270
"This chasm has
devoured our closeness."

683
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:41,060
"I am living in bits and pieces."

684
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:47,390
"Life, why do you
have so many complains?"

685
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:51,020
"Now I have a grievance from God."

686
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:54,060
"It's the gift of time."

687
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,970
"Now I am aloof from myself."

688
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,600
"Without you."

689
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,640
"Why do faces change?"

690
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:06,810
"Why doesn't it support us?"

691
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:10,810
"Life, you are envious of my dreams."

692
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:12,810
Come on. You have to eat.

693
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:19,060
"Why aren't you like your reflection?"

694
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:26,140
"Why isn't your
disposition like your face?"

695
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,930
Reading? - Eighty ... Sir?
- Dopomine drip, please.

696
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,600
Doctor, what's happening?
What happened?

697
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,890
Take her out.
- Ma'am.

698
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,310
Please go out.
- Is he okay?

699
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,810
Nandita.
- What's happening, doctor?

700
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:04,140
Nandita!
- Doctor. - Please let's go out.

701
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,270
Let them be..

702
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:10,270
..two ampoules. Fast.

703
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,890
Sir, the ABG report has come.

704
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:14,310
Shows metabolic acidosis.

705
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:15,850
Sodium bicarb.

706
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,270
What the..

707
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,890
Defibrillator.
- Sir.

708
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,470
Hydropine, two ampoules.

709
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:46,350
Come on. Come on.

710
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:53,970
Come on, young man. Come on.

711
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,220
Readings?

712
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,310
Sir, not recording.

713
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:09,140
Come on.

714
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:11,640
Come on.

715
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:47,890
Oh, God!

716
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:11,850
Is my son dead?

717
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,600
Doctor?

718
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:23,520
Is my son dead?

719
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:04,470
"Everything has come to a standstill."

720
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:10,890
"Time came to a
standstill when you paused."

721
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:17,520
"You are lost in yourself."

722
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:23,850
"Now you are not concerned about me."

723
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:27,430
"Life, get a grip."

724
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,470
"Change a bit."

725
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,430
"Have some mercy and be tender."

726
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:37,180
"Why are you being stubborn?"

727
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:40,220
"Why do faces change?"

728
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:43,310
"Why doesn't it support us?"

729
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:49,680
"Life, you are envious of my dreams."

730
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:55,470
"Why aren't you like your reflection?"

731
00:54:55,970 --> 00:55:03,180
"Why isn't your
disposition like your face?"

732
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,810
Well played, doc.

733
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,310
Sir.

734
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:19,890
What are you doing here?

735
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,310
Sir, I want to talk to you.

736
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:27,470
About what?
- Sir, about Ankur Arora.

737
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,100
What about Ankur...Arora?

738
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:34,640
Sir, everyone makes a mistake.

739
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:38,720
If we hide that mistake and if
that mistake costs someone's life..

740
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:42,140
..it's considered murder..
- What mistake? What mistake?

741
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:44,640
Sir, you know I am talking
about Ankur. He died because of..

742
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:45,850
..Pneumothorax.

743
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:47,140
Didn't you see the death certificate?

744
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:50,140
He died because of lung failure.

745
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:57,020
Do you know what you are doing?

746
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:00,430
You are insulting a reputed doctor.

747
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:04,350
Romesh, if I take
this insult seriously..

748
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,310
..I will throw you
out of the hospital.

749
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:09,560
And you won't be
able to do internship..

750
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,810
..in any hospital in the world.

751
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:12,470
And I am saying it sincerely.

752
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:16,720
So don't mess with me.

753
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:18,930
Sir, you can stop me
from becoming a doctor.

754
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,850
But just once tell
his mother the truth.

755
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:23,350
He died not because of illness
but because of your negligence.

756
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:24,720
Sir, please.

757
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:27,430
Sir, accept this truth in
front of his mother. Sir, please.

758
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,600
Goodnight, sir.

759
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,270
Sir, she has the
right to know the truth.

760
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:32,640
Sir, I consider you my mentor.
Sir, I worship you.

761
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:34,390
Sir, please don't lie.

762
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,100
Why do you feel ashamed
to accept your mistake?

763
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,470
In this profession of saving lives..

764
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,770
..you don't always
succeed in saving lives.

765
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,270
This is the truth.

766
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:42,270
Just accept it. It's better for you.

767
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,560
Romesh, it happens in
the medical profession.

768
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:47,850
It will keep happening.

769
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:50,100
Sir, if this has been happening..
- Enough. Enough.

770
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:52,600
We won't discuss this again.
Do you understand?

771
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,140
No, sir. I can't understand.

772
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:02,770
You won't agree like this.
I don't have time for this nonsense.

773
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,680
Come on.

774
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,270
Thanks.

775
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:17,810
What I was saying is..

776
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:20,520
Romesh.

777
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:29,560
Hello.
- Hello, son. Sit.

778
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,970
Do you know? Papa
was repeatedly asking..

779
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,560
..about you and not about me.

780
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,770
I have ordered soup for you.

781
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:43,100
No. I was just telling Riya
that this is the last year..

782
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,060
..of your internship.

783
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:48,140
And very soon you guys
will have to decide..

784
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:50,850
..what you have to do in this field.

785
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:53,640
That's it. I was concerned about that.

786
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:58,890
I have told papa
I want to do cardiology.

787
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:02,600
But papa is saying
I should do neurology.

788
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,060
Riya, mark my words.

789
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,680
Neurology is the future of medicine.

790
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:11,100
And robotic technology has
also become very advanced.

791
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,350
Your soup, sir.
- Because of that income is also good.

792
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,140
Romesh, have soup.

793
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:19,430
Romesh. Romesh.

794
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,720
What is this, Riya?

795
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:33,390
What the hell is the matter with you?

796
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:35,310
Do you realize you insulted papa?

797
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:36,930
He was saying
something to you, and you..

798
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:39,140
And Asthana is playing
badminton somewhere.

799
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,850
We are planning our future.

800
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:46,770
And there, a mother is
mourning her son's death.

801
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:49,850
She still doesn't know
the reason for his death.

802
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:54,640
Yes. She is mourning. Her son is dead.

803
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,220
And I am really sorry for that.

804
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:58,270
I am sorry we are not
doing what we should be doing.

805
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,970
So you tell me. What should we do?

806
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,270
We should stop living?
We should also mourn?

807
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:04,350
Truth.

808
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:08,350
You know what truth means?

809
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,470
We just have to tell that
mother the truth. Nothing else.

810
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,470
That you guys killed her son.

811
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,020
All of you have murdered Ankur Arora.

812
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,180
This is not the truth.

813
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:22,930
Today, seeing you, I am wondering..

814
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,430
..are you the same Riya I love?

815
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,600
Or are you the one
whom I don't even know?

816
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:31,140
What do you mean?
- You have become like them. Like them.

817
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:34,020
Like them? I have become like them?

818
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:35,270
Yes, you have.

819
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:38,470
Like the ones who build
their palace on someone's tomb.

820
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:40,020
Romesh, please don't say that.

821
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,560
I know I lied to you.
But what could I do?

822
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:45,060
I did not have any other choice.

823
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:46,520
You didn't have a
choice yesterday, Riya.

824
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,720
Today, you have a choice.

825
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:50,430
You will rectify the
wrong that has been done.

826
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,140
You will have to take
this decision today.

827
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,600
Right now.

828
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:56,270
Are you out of your mind?

829
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:58,470
Do you think I will go
against Shekhawat, Dr. Asthana..

830
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,270
..and the entire medical fraternity?

831
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:03,140
That too for the child who is dead.

832
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:05,720
Yes. That's what I think.

833
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:10,350
So also understand that
if we do this, we will be ruined.

834
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,600
Our dreams, our future,
our career. Everything.

835
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,430
So let us be ruined.

836
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:18,350
Romesh, please try to understand.

837
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:20,310
Papa has paid 80
lakhs as capitation fees.

838
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:22,020
So that I can be a successful doctor.

839
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:23,350
I can't just throw it away because..

840
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:24,930
..your conscience is pricking you.

841
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:30,470
Try to understand. Such accidents
are common in this profession.

842
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:34,770
So fine.

843
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:41,100
Today decide whether you
are with me or against me.

844
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:46,060
Decide? Against who? Against myself?
Is that what you want?

845
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:50,020
Romesh, I was also in the OT.

846
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,890
I am a witness to that incident.

847
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:54,810
I am a part of that incident
because I have hidden the truth.

848
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:56,350
If this matter is disclosed,
there could be..

849
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:57,890
..legal action against me.

850
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,930
I might have to go to court
and I might be sent to prison.

851
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:02,520
Please try to understand.

852
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,350
You can't see that unknowingly..

853
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:06,220
..you are going against me.

854
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,270
You are fighting me.
- Maybe.

855
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:11,890
And maybe everyone's
wellbeing lies in this.

856
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:16,770
I am not responsible
for that accident.

857
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,890
I won't let my life be ruined.

858
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,520
I have never seen truth ruining lives.

859
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:24,970
So tell me, Riya.

860
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:30,180
With me...or against me.

861
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:33,140
Romesh.
- With me or against me?

862
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:37,100
Romesh, please.
- Riya, with me or against me?

863
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,560
Romesh, you are
making a grave mistake.

864
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,100
Riya, answer me.
With me or against me?

865
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:45,770
Fine. So listen.
I am against you. Against you.

866
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:21,640
Are you strolling in a park?

867
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:24,140
Are you crazy?

868
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:49,060
When Arjun asked Lord Krishna,
"What is Brahma?"

869
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,390
He answers his questions.

870
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:56,640
God even talks about karma,
yoga and divine devotion.

871
01:02:56,970 --> 01:03:00,810
It's written in Shrimad
Bhagavad that the supreme truth..

872
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:04,350
..is also known as Brahma,
Supreme Being or God.

873
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:08,180
Even a living being is called Brahma.

874
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:10,850
Arjun asks about the soul.

875
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,100
Why are you standing outside? Come in.

876
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:19,310
I am sorry.
I shouldn't have come here now.

877
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:22,890
But, I had to give you this letter.

878
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:24,270
So, I thought..

879
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:28,020
What's in it?

880
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:33,140
Please read it when you get the time.

881
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,970
See you. Thank you.

882
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:47,680
"Dear Nandita. I know
Ankur will never return.

883
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:50,770
"But, as his mother you've a right.."

884
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:55,640
"..to know what happened with him.

885
01:03:57,060 --> 01:04:03,270
"Because, what you know is
far away from the truth."

886
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,390
"What the hospital
told you isn't true?"

887
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,720
"And, you've a right
to know the truth."

888
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:37,430
He was lying on this table.

889
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:41,520
After the operation was over.

890
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:48,180
'Oh my, God. He's vomiting.'

891
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:50,430
'Oh God!'
- 'He's aspirating.'

892
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,140
'Oh, God! Nurse. Intussception machine,
quickly. - He's..'

893
01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:53,930
'Sir, his oxygen
saturation is dropping.'

894
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:55,430
'Call doctor Asthana, right now.
- Yes, sir.'

895
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,470
You don't know what to do
in a situation like this.

896
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:02,350
Except for the fact
that something went wrong.

897
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,640
'I cannot see anything.'

898
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:04,930
'Laryngoscope, fast.'

899
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,720
'What's happening?'
- 'He aspirated, doctor.'

900
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:08,470
'Why didn't anyone tell me..'

901
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,310
'..he ate something before
the operation?' - 'Ventilator.'

902
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:11,560
'No, doctor.'

903
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,520
'There's lot of vomit,
let me clean this first.'

904
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:14,810
'Nurse, quick.
- Sir.'

905
01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:17,220
'Oxygen saturation's down.
- I cannot see anything.'

906
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:18,220
'There's food all over.'

907
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:19,680
'You are not doing this
for the first time, doctor.'

908
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:21,270
'You've done this a thousand times.
Streetscape.'

909
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,930
'Ventilator.
- Saturation's .5 sir.'

910
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:26,390
'The trachea's normal, sir.
- Are you sure?'

911
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,680
'Yes, sir.'

912
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,140
'Reading, Dr. Riya.
- It's going up, sir.'

913
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:38,680
'Please check, please.
- What?'

914
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:40,100
'Just check him.'

915
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:45,810
'Ankur. Ankur. Open your eyes.'

916
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:48,810
'Ankur. Open your eyes.'

917
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:50,270
'Ankur.'

918
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:51,470
'Ankur, can you hear me?'

919
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:52,770
The brain went dead.

920
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,720
Coma.

921
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:13,560
Oh, God. Baby.

922
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:19,560
My baby. My baby.

923
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:22,470
My baby.

924
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,390
I should've been here.

925
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:48,560
Oh, God.

926
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:51,600
Nandita, she's Kajori Sen.

927
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:52,850
Our advocate.

928
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:58,680
Mrs. Nandita Arora, we can definitely
file a case against them.

929
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:00,310
It may be tough.

930
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:05,470
But, we can demand a big
amount as compensation.

931
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:10,310
What price will they
pay for Ankur's life?

932
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:13,850
10 crores? 20 crores? 100?

933
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:18,180
That won't bring my son back.

934
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:19,640
So, what do you want?

935
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:23,520
Maybe, after this case..

936
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:27,060
..this won't happen with anyone else.

937
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:31,640
Shekhawat. The owner.

938
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,020
He's an influential man.

939
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:40,060
So, obviously,
he'll have powerful connections.

940
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:47,180
So, I hope you understand.
- I do, I do.

941
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:56,770
But, one doesn't stop
fighting with the fear of losing.

942
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:02,350
And Dr. Romesh. I hope..

943
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:05,350
..the doctors of your medical
fraternity will be against you.

944
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,390
They will never forgive you.

945
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:12,180
I will file this case.
We will defend it.

946
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:15,560
But, you can stand down if you like.

947
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:17,600
Save your career.

948
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:20,770
I can save my career..

949
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:24,020
..but what about my conscience?

950
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:34,640
Good morning, dear.
- Good morning, papa.

951
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:36,930
Sir, tea?
- Yes. Prepare the breakfast quickly.

952
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:38,180
I've to leave for office.
- Yes.

953
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:40,310
What are you eating, dear?
- Cornflakes.

954
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:41,600
Very good.

955
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:56,270
Hello.

956
01:08:57,890 --> 01:08:59,020
Just a minute.

957
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:02,970
Sir, there's an urgent call for you.
- Fine. Go.

958
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,220
Hello.
- Sir, I'm speaking from Zee News.

959
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,680
Mrs. Arora, has filed a case of
Medical Negligence against you.

960
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:14,600
Would you like to comment on it?

961
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:19,850
Damn!

962
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:31,220
..there is an intern's hand in this..?

963
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:35,890
Excuse me.

964
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:44,890
Dr. Riya Srivastav. Sit down.

965
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:50,310
Tea? Coffee?

966
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:54,850
I'm sorry. I am Rajiv Mallani.

967
01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:00,270
Mr. Mallani will be
defending our case.

968
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:02,390
In the Ankur Arora case..

969
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:05,850
..there were four other doctors
present along with Dr. Asthana.

970
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:09,560
You were one of them.

971
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,140
After that incident in
the operation theatre..

972
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:17,220
..did you talk to anyone outside?

973
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:23,020
Dr. Riya, anything that
you know and we don't?

974
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,720
If there's anything, then say it now.

975
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:33,270
Otherwise,
Dr. Asthana's reputation, mine..

976
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:36,430
..in fact, this
hospital will be a big joke.

977
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:40,770
And, we'll have to pay a big price.

978
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:43,680
So, in case there's anything?

979
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:51,100
Priya. Everyone knows about
your relation with Romesh.

980
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:53,930
You two stay together
in the Living Quarters.

981
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:59,020
People objected, but I said its love.

982
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:00,350
Let it blossom.

983
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,770
Speak up, Dr. Riya.

984
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:06,470
Was it Dr. Romesh?

985
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:08,770
Riya.

986
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:12,180
What did you tell Dr. Romesh?

987
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:14,310
Say it.

988
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:18,180
Speak up!

989
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:39,520
I'm taking my stuff.

990
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:46,310
And...keep this.

991
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:53,140
I don't need it now.

992
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:09,470
I told them.

993
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:12,720
I couldn't lie.

994
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:18,270
They wanted to know how
others learnt about that incident.

995
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:21,680
I said it was you.

996
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,310
You went to the lawyer.

997
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,930
So, why are you feeling bad about it?

998
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,390
I'm doing what I should.

999
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:41,100
You do what you should.
- Romesh.

1000
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:45,680
I am helpless, not bad.

1001
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:52,810
No, you're not,
I'm more helpless than you.

1002
01:12:54,430 --> 01:12:56,020
But, I've already made a decision.

1003
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:59,100
That I will support the truth,
not run from it.

1004
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,930
Truth? What truth?

1005
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:08,350
A truth that's ruining our future.

1006
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:10,310
Truth doesn't ruin anyone, Riya.

1007
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:13,640
But evading the truth can ruin you.

1008
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:31,520
Come in.

1009
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:41,520
My resignation.

1010
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:48,390
You're a fine example of
bravery and foolishness, Dr. Romesh.

1011
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:52,720
Maybe.

1012
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,640
It's better than being
arrogant and careless.

1013
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,810
Dr. Asthana.

1014
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:05,390
It's easier to point
fingers at others, Dr. Romesh.

1015
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:08,270
Don't forget what happened in
the operation theatre that day.

1016
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,770
Your hands froze while
administering an injection.

1017
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:14,680
Careless?

1018
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:16,520
If it wasn't for me..

1019
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:21,850
..then Lakshmi would've died.
- I remember, sir.

1020
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:24,310
You saved his life.

1021
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:27,970
And, I also remember..

1022
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,560
..you didn't allow me in the
operation theatre after that.

1023
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:32,350
That's right.

1024
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:34,220
That should happen with you.

1025
01:14:35,310 --> 01:14:36,390
You're right.

1026
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,020
I made a mistake and I was kicked out.

1027
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,220
Now, it's your turn.

1028
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:47,810
So, you want me to
sacrifice my position..

1029
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:51,430
..the hospital's reputation for you.

1030
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:55,140
You don't need to do anything.

1031
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:58,140
Now, I'll do
whatever needs to be done.

1032
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:06,310
You won't be able to do anything.

1033
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:11,180
I will finish you.

1034
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,020
My career hasn't started,
so what will you finish.

1035
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:20,350
I've nothing to lose.

1036
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:23,970
And, you have everything.

1037
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:39,060
My Lord, this year
on the 9th of June..

1038
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:41,470
..a terrible incident occurred.

1039
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:47,100
An eight year old boy
undergoing appendix operation died.

1040
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:49,970
Because the hospital
his mother chose..

1041
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:55,270
..trusted, wasn't fit to
undertake a simple operation.

1042
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:59,270
And if they were capable,
they were careless.

1043
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:01,560
Whatever the reason.

1044
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:05,270
But, the innocent boy
had to pay with his life.

1045
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:08,560
Your Honour, that day
before the operation..

1046
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,520
..Dr. Asthana was
informed that Ankur..

1047
01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:13,970
..ate some biscuits an hour ago.

1048
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:19,060
In such cases, doctors use a
special tube called Ryle's tube.

1049
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:21,720
To siphon the food out of the stomach.

1050
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:27,470
But, Your Honour. This tube wasn't
used during the operation.

1051
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:30,810
Why? Because they forgot.

1052
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:33,970
The biscuits in Ankur's
stomach became poisonous.

1053
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:35,810
And spread to his lungs.

1054
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:37,140
He went into coma.

1055
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:38,930
Cerebral hypoxic.

1056
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:42,270
And two days later, he died.

1057
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:46,470
Your Honour, the
prosecution will now prove..

1058
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:50,100
..that the hospital wasn't
just careless, but also criminal.

1059
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:52,850
We'll prove that the
doctor's actions..

1060
01:16:52,970 --> 01:16:55,060
..was nothing less
than 1st degree murder.

1061
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:58,640
We'll also prove that in
order to hide their crime..

1062
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:03,100
..they aren't just guilty,
but also culprits.

1063
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:07,140
I didn't make any chart, Your Honour.

1064
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,970
Nor am I going to
comment on this profession.

1065
01:17:10,810 --> 01:17:12,600
Because I completely trust..

1066
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:14,310
..the doctors of
Shekhawat General Hospital.

1067
01:17:14,770 --> 01:17:16,720
That, day during the operation..

1068
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:21,270
..Ankur Arora's lungs collapsed.

1069
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:24,560
In medical terms, it's
called Neumo-thorax.

1070
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:26,970
In this condition,
the patient can't breathe.

1071
01:17:27,270 --> 01:17:29,060
The vital organs don't get oxygen.

1072
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:30,890
The oxygen doesn't reach the brain.

1073
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:33,020
And, the patient slips into coma.

1074
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:34,720
And, that is exactly what happened..

1075
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:36,140
..to Ankur Arora that day.

1076
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:40,770
Abusing the doctors,
defaming the hospitals..

1077
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:43,560
..blackmailing them is easy.

1078
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:47,560
Because they care
about their reputation.

1079
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:51,930
They become easy targets.

1080
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:55,930
In fact, Your Honour, this is
a case of extortion, blackmail.

1081
01:17:56,060 --> 01:18:00,560
And, why should we bow before
such blatant blackmail, extortion?

1082
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:20,060
You took my advice of
defending medical legal cases.

1083
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:23,850
You've made a good name for
yourself by winning four cases.

1084
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:26,560
Romesh had to come to you.

1085
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:29,180
If you're smart,
we can delay this a lot.

1086
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,430
Shekhawat has very deep pockets.

1087
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,180
Time to make my new office,
and your new bungalow.

1088
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:41,060
So...what do I have to do now?

1089
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:43,720
Just keep humiliating
the hospital in the court.

1090
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:47,100
And go easy on Dr. Asthana.

1091
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:49,600
Keep saving him as long as you can.

1092
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:52,140
The case will stay pending.

1093
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:53,850
And the judge won't be
able to pass a verdict.

1094
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:58,020
And I will make sure that
the confusion continues.

1095
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,680
I have to go now.

1096
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,100
Bye, my dear opposition lawyer.

1097
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:10,850
You're always leaving.

1098
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:15,100
Always in a hurry.
- I'm a busy man.

1099
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:23,770
We were supposed to
talk about us today?

1100
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:29,470
What? That I am married
and we don't have a future.

1101
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:39,270
I know.

1102
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:42,350
But I forget.

1103
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:54,470
Mr. Bhargav. What do you do?

1104
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,100
I am a handwriting expert.

1105
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:00,520
So tell me, was your
expertise put to use..

1106
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,390
..in cases like these before?
- Yes, many times.

1107
01:20:03,850 --> 01:20:05,560
I don't remember how many times.

1108
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:06,850
Oh, I see.

1109
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,060
Your Honour.
This is the blow up of a ledger..

1110
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:13,390
..where Ankur's details were lodged.

1111
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,430
The details before his operation.

1112
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:19,720
It's written here
"Time before last meal, nine hours".

1113
01:20:19,970 --> 01:20:21,180
Meaning nine hours.

1114
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:24,430
Mr. Bhargav. Please tell the court..

1115
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,220
..what do you find out
after reading this page?

1116
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:30,140
For a common man,
this is just a number.

1117
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:35,390
Number nine. But for me,
it's number one.

1118
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:39,350
Which has been turned to nine.

1119
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:44,270
Here, by turning it like this.

1120
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:47,640
And, it's been done by
two people, not one person.

1121
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:50,890
With two different pens,
at two different times.

1122
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:53,020
Whenever we write
something on the paper..

1123
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:55,970
..fine impressions
appear on the paper.

1124
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:59,060
And we can see them
only through a computer.

1125
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:00,890
Normally, when a man writes..

1126
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:03,430
..impressions appear on the paper.

1127
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,140
But, when he changes something..

1128
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:07,470
..he does it with a light hand.

1129
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:09,020
Carefully.

1130
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:11,970
So, there are less
impressions on that side.

1131
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:15,310
Even on this paper,
there are impressions everywhere.

1132
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:19,220
Except, for this nine,
where it's less..

1133
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:20,770
..which was changed.

1134
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:22,890
What can I tell the court now?

1135
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:24,680
It's all clear.

1136
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:27,850
Two different people can't
write on the same paper..

1137
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:30,350
..at the same place,
and the same time.

1138
01:21:30,930 --> 01:21:32,180
So, it's obvious.

1139
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:35,060
Someone's changed that to nine.

1140
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:39,350
Your Honour.
We don't know who stole this ledger.

1141
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:43,350
We don't know whether
Dr. Asthana is behind it or not.

1142
01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:45,640
But, someone has definitely done it.

1143
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:47,770
And, the funny thing is.

1144
01:21:47,890 --> 01:21:51,770
According to this ledger,
if Ankur ate something..

1145
01:21:51,890 --> 01:21:53,350
..nine hours before the operation..

1146
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:55,720
..then, it was 1 o'clock at night.

1147
01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:00,680
And, I don't have to be
a genius to understand..

1148
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:05,600
..that no patient eats
at 1 o'clock at night.

1149
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:12,890
You're talking on the phone again.

1150
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:15,560
That means you won't come today.

1151
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,930
Not just at night, but we'll meet
less during the day as well.

1152
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:19,680
As long as this case is going on.

1153
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:22,680
If anyone sees us together,
we'll be in trouble.

1154
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:25,020
You're right.

1155
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:28,310
But, I wanted to tell you something.

1156
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:30,350
It's urgent.
- What?

1157
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:34,850
Not over the phone, we've to meet.

1158
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:39,640
Now. Please.

1159
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:52,430
What happened?

1160
01:22:58,600 --> 01:22:59,680
I am pregnant.

1161
01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:04,770
I thought something's
wrong with the case.

1162
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,310
Don't worry, the case is fine.

1163
01:23:13,310 --> 01:23:14,520
Is this why you wanted to meet?

1164
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:19,220
We could've talked
about this on the phone.

1165
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:23,770
Yes, we could.

1166
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:35,680
It's a small procedure.

1167
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:38,680
Abort it.

1168
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,720
There's a special on me
on the 10 o'clock news.

1169
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:51,220
They will praise me.

1170
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:53,520
I'm going to watch that.

1171
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:56,310
Call me when it's done.

1172
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:28,100
Kajori's trying to prove..

1173
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:30,020
..that it's the
hospital's carelessness.

1174
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,310
Not Dr. Asthana.

1175
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:33,470
She's trying to confuse the issue.

1176
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:36,390
"Anyone can steal the ledger,
anyone can write on it."

1177
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:37,640
"This...that."

1178
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:39,560
Smart move.

1179
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:42,060
The court can't punish just anyone.

1180
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:48,310
As our lawyer, it's her duty
to prove Dr. Asthana guilty.

1181
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:49,930
But, she isn't doing that.

1182
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:52,770
That's why I followed her.

1183
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:57,180
I saw her with Mallani. Shocking.

1184
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:00,270
She's trying to confuse us.

1185
01:25:00,350 --> 01:25:01,470
And, we're caught.

1186
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,720
Can't she understand a child is dead?

1187
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,930
She's taking
advantage of that, for money?

1188
01:25:09,310 --> 01:25:10,390
I want to meet her.

1189
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,270
I want to meet her right now. Come on.

1190
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:32,390
Kajori, open the door.

1191
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:34,770
We know you're inside.
We want to talk to you.

1192
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:44,350
Kajori, open the damn door!
We know you're inside!

1193
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:47,890
Break down the door.

1194
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:50,020
Break down the door.
Just break the damn door.

1195
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,310
Just break it!
- Yes.

1196
01:25:58,270 --> 01:25:59,350
Oh, God.

1197
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:08,060
Ajay, call an ambulance. Quickly.

1198
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:26,310
The doctors are saying she's fine.

1199
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:30,680
She swallowed...

1200
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:33,770
She had an allergic reaction.

1201
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:34,930
She barely managed to survive.

1202
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:37,270
What?
- Abortion pills.

1203
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,180
She was pregnant.

1204
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:09,220
How are you feeling?

1205
01:27:23,390 --> 01:27:24,470
I am...

1206
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:27,770
I am sorry.

1207
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:34,970
Forgive me.

1208
01:27:40,270 --> 01:27:41,560
I promise..

1209
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:47,350
He.. he was wronged

1210
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:56,470
Can you forgive me?

1211
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:14,020
Now you will know what it
means to lose your child.

1212
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:24,770
You can fight this
better than anyone else.

1213
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:37,100
Three days later
Dr. Romesh Sharma came home..

1214
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:41,810
..and told me how my son Ankur died.

1215
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:48,220
Your witness, please.

1216
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:54,810
Do you recognize this form?

1217
01:28:57,890 --> 01:29:01,220
It's the same form you signed
before your son's operation.

1218
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:07,220
Are these your signatures?

1219
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:11,140
Do you sign any
paper without reading it?

1220
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,220
Without knowing what's written in it?

1221
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:18,930
What?
- No, I don't.

1222
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:22,930
Then, please read out point two
in these operation guidelines.

1223
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:32,310
Patient should be NBM,
6-8 hours before operation.

1224
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:36,720
NBM. Meaning, Nothing
By Mouth, Your Honour.

1225
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:39,180
It's clearly written on this form..

1226
01:29:39,470 --> 01:29:45,350
..patient cannot eat anything
6-8 hours before the operation.

1227
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:47,140
He has to stay on a empty stomach.

1228
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:50,520
And, the patient's mother's
signatures are on this form.

1229
01:29:50,810 --> 01:29:54,180
A mother that's blaming
the doctors for carelessness.

1230
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:56,020
But, she's forgetting..

1231
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:58,270
..she made the
biggest careless mistake.

1232
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:03,140
She let her son eat biscuits
one hour before the operation.

1233
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:04,930
Ask her, Your Honour.

1234
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:07,470
What was she doing when
her son was eating biscuits?

1235
01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:09,100
Staring at him?

1236
01:30:09,350 --> 01:30:10,430
Watching television?

1237
01:30:10,770 --> 01:30:13,060
Or fixing an appointment
with the beauty salon?

1238
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:18,680
Your witness.

1239
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:36,060
Mrs. Arora, what is
Myocardial Infraction?

1240
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:37,970
Do you know that?
- No.

1241
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:41,600
It's a heart attack. Acute coryza.

1242
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:44,060
You must be familiar
with these terms. - No.

1243
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:45,720
No?

1244
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:48,310
Common cold. Cephalalgia.

1245
01:30:48,890 --> 01:30:52,020
You must have heard this.
- I don't know all that.

1246
01:30:52,970 --> 01:30:54,060
Headache.

1247
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:58,770
Don't you
know...according to my friend here..

1248
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:01,640
..you should've known
all medical information..

1249
01:31:01,770 --> 01:31:04,430
..before admitting
your son in that hospital.

1250
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:05,680
Objection, Your Honour.

1251
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:07,850
The prosecution is
trying to lead the witness.

1252
01:31:07,970 --> 01:31:09,100
Excuse me.

1253
01:31:10,270 --> 01:31:11,850
Do you know what ED stands for?

1254
01:31:13,930 --> 01:31:15,270
I thought you know.

1255
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:17,720
Erectile dysfunction.

1256
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:24,310
Sorry.
- Your Honour, please answer me.

1257
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:26,720
Did you know the meaning of NBM?

1258
01:31:28,270 --> 01:31:29,560
Objection overruled.

1259
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:32,520
Your Honour, whether
the common people..

1260
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:35,520
..know about these medical
terms or not, doesn't matter.

1261
01:31:35,770 --> 01:31:39,890
What matters is that the
treating doctors should know.

1262
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:43,850
And especially a fantastic
surgeon like Dr. Asthana.

1263
01:32:15,020 --> 01:32:16,140
What the hell are you doing?

1264
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:22,270
What do you mean?
- I mean you've to stretch this case.

1265
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:24,970
You don't need to win it.
- I see.

1266
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:29,520
Is that what I had to do?
- Sorry, I forgot.

1267
01:32:29,930 --> 01:32:31,430
What?
- Yes, I forgot.

1268
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:33,310
Because, I am in a hurry.

1269
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:35,640
I've to watch
television at 10 tonight.

1270
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:37,970
Hear my praises on the news.

1271
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:39,720
Only mine.

1272
01:32:40,850 --> 01:32:41,930
No one else.

1273
01:32:42,350 --> 01:32:45,470
Your anger is for the
rascal you had to abort.

1274
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:51,850
No. It's for the
rascal I had to sleep with.

1275
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,220
You're a compromising woman.

1276
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:56,350
And nothing else.

1277
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:58,930
I made you a lawyer.

1278
01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:02,270
You will stand against me.

1279
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:04,060
I am still a compromising woman.

1280
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:08,600
The only difference is,
this time I'm standing for the truth.

1281
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:10,810
Not the body.

1282
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,600
I will blow you away in the court.

1283
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:15,770
Go ahead.

1284
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,720
But remember, Rajiv Mallani.

1285
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:24,100
This time, you're facing
two mothers, not two women.

1286
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:27,520
We'll eradicate you from existence.

1287
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:31,020
Just like women like us say.

1288
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:36,470
We won't touch, and disrobe you.

1289
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:15,770
"The light was missing."

1290
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:20,970
"The daylight was low."

1291
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:28,390
"There was fog."

1292
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:32,810
"And, my eyes were wet."

1293
01:34:34,390 --> 01:34:37,140
"The clouds have cleared."

1294
01:34:37,270 --> 01:34:40,270
"The sky's clear now."

1295
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:45,180
"I can see a clear ray of light now."

1296
01:34:45,310 --> 01:34:57,060
"The ambience...
is filled with rays if light."

1297
01:34:57,350 --> 01:35:07,220
"Now...the ambience...
is filled with rays if light."

1298
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:08,390
Hello.

1299
01:35:09,310 --> 01:35:12,390
Hello.

1300
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:16,850
"My crime.."

1301
01:35:16,970 --> 01:35:18,100
Hello, who is it?

1302
01:35:21,310 --> 01:35:34,560
"Now... the ambience...
is filled with rays if light."

1303
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:43,850
Are you sure we'll find her here?

1304
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:47,220
Mallani had told me.

1305
01:35:47,770 --> 01:35:50,310
They've hidden her here in Goa.

1306
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:53,060
She's here.

1307
01:35:53,810 --> 01:35:54,890
100%.

1308
01:35:58,180 --> 01:35:59,270
There she is.

1309
01:35:59,350 --> 01:36:00,600
One with the priest.

1310
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:03,270
You will be alright.
Christ is with you my child.

1311
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:05,390
Yes, Father.
- Go.

1312
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:13,270
Hi. My name's Kajori Sen.

1313
01:36:13,770 --> 01:36:15,020
I am a lawyer.

1314
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:18,680
You must know,
we've filed a case against..

1315
01:36:18,810 --> 01:36:22,180
..Dr. Asthana and the hospital
in the Ankur Arora case.

1316
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:24,890
Rubina. Listen to me please.

1317
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:27,060
I don't know anything.

1318
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:29,270
And, please leave me alone.

1319
01:36:37,390 --> 01:36:38,520
Rubina.

1320
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:42,470
Listen to me.

1321
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:46,180
There was a boy, Ankur.

1322
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:49,720
You saw him with your own eyes.

1323
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:52,770
You looked after him.

1324
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:56,180
He told you that he ate something.

1325
01:36:57,270 --> 01:37:01,520
And, you went to Dr. Asthana, worried.

1326
01:37:04,430 --> 01:37:06,470
Do you remember that
boy's face, Rubina?

1327
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:10,560
Tell me, do you
remember that boy's face?

1328
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:16,810
He's no more, Rosina.

1329
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:20,310
He's dead.

1330
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:26,600
His mother performed his last rites.

1331
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:29,140
He's turned to dust.

1332
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:39,270
Your Honour. Prosecution
would now like to call..

1333
01:37:39,390 --> 01:37:41,060
..Nurse Rosina to the witness box.

1334
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:45,060
Who? I am sorry, Your Honour.

1335
01:37:46,180 --> 01:37:48,600
Rosina's name isn't
on the witness list.

1336
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:50,350
She cannot take the stand.

1337
01:37:50,470 --> 01:37:53,930
Moreover, the defense needs time
to prepare his cross-examination.

1338
01:37:54,310 --> 01:37:56,140
My Lord, she's a reluctant witness..

1339
01:37:56,270 --> 01:37:57,720
..and very important to the case.

1340
01:37:59,270 --> 01:38:00,770
The witness can take the stand.

1341
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:03,890
The defense will be granted
time to prepare their case.

1342
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:07,220
But, the witness will have to
be called again for the defense.

1343
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:09,930
Do you agree, Ms. Sen?
- I agree, My Lord.

1344
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:23,810
Tell the court your
name and your designation.

1345
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:26,180
My name is Rosina D'costa.

1346
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:29,850
I am a ward nurse in
Shekhawat General Hospital.

1347
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:33,430
But, you just returned
from Goa. Is that right?

1348
01:38:33,970 --> 01:38:37,140
Yes. I had taken a
leave for a few days.

1349
01:38:37,930 --> 01:38:41,430
Rosina. Is it true
that you took leave..

1350
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:44,020
..on the day Ankur slipped into coma?

1351
01:38:45,890 --> 01:38:46,930
Yes.

1352
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:50,770
And, is it true that Dr. Asthana..

1353
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:53,850
..paid you a huge sum, that day?
- Yes.

1354
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:55,680
That's true.

1355
01:38:55,970 --> 01:38:57,430
But, there's another truth.

1356
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:01,270
Dr. Asthana was sending you away..

1357
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,850
..because you were
the first one to inform him..

1358
01:39:04,270 --> 01:39:08,520
..that Ankur ate some
biscuits before the operation.

1359
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:10,220
Isn't that right?

1360
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:21,520
Its okay, Rosina.
No need to be scared.

1361
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:23,430
You can tell the truth here.

1362
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:26,560
Did you tell Dr. Asthana about this?

1363
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:29,600
Rosina. Look at me.

1364
01:39:29,890 --> 01:39:32,140
Don't be scared. Tell the truth.

1365
01:39:32,770 --> 01:39:35,270
Say it.
- No.

1366
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:38,720
Nothing like that happened.

1367
01:39:39,430 --> 01:39:43,350
What? What are you saying, Rosina?

1368
01:39:43,470 --> 01:39:45,850
I didn't know whether the
child ate something or not.

1369
01:39:45,970 --> 01:39:48,930
And, I don't know what you're saying.

1370
01:39:49,970 --> 01:39:51,140
I don't know.

1371
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:52,720
Rosina, why are you lying?

1372
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:54,270
Rosina.

1373
01:40:00,890 --> 01:40:01,970
Silence!

1374
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:04,520
Silence in the court!

1375
01:40:05,020 --> 01:40:07,600
Your Honour,
the witness has turned hostile..

1376
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:09,350
..and she be excused.

1377
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:13,970
The court will reconvene at
Monday morning, at 9 o'clock.

1378
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:17,560
Rosina, why..
- Come on, sit down.

1379
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:46,470
I didn't lay a finger.
And you're defamed.

1380
01:40:59,140 --> 01:41:00,180
What now?

1381
01:41:03,270 --> 01:41:04,350
Nothing.

1382
01:41:06,140 --> 01:41:09,520
We don't have
evidence against Asthana.

1383
01:41:14,310 --> 01:41:17,560
As of now, we've lost this case.

1384
01:41:36,350 --> 01:41:39,560
'Do people die in an
appendix operation?'

1385
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:43,520
'No, no one dies because of it.
And we won't let you die.'

1386
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:46,310
'Are you sure?
- Very sure.'

1387
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,930
Yes, stop here. Stop. Stop.

1388
01:42:57,560 --> 01:42:58,600
Here's your fare.

1389
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:06,770
Romesh.
- Come with me.

1390
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:07,970
Where?

1391
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:14,930
What happened?
- Just a second.

1392
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:16,060
What happened?

1393
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:19,060
What's wrong?
- I don't know myself.

1394
01:43:26,020 --> 01:43:28,180
This here. You see this.

1395
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:29,640
This is vomit.

1396
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:31,140
This thread was around Ankur's neck..

1397
01:43:31,270 --> 01:43:32,390
..during the operation.

1398
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:34,180
His vomit is on the thread.

1399
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:37,930
It's dried up, but it's adequate.
- For what?

1400
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:39,430
DNA finger printing.

1401
01:43:40,060 --> 01:43:42,680
This vomit contains
Ankur's DNA. His vomited acids.

1402
01:43:42,810 --> 01:43:44,470
And traces of what he ate.

1403
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:46,390
But how will we prove that..

1404
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:50,140
..the vomit particles on
this thread is Ankur's,

1405
01:43:50,270 --> 01:43:52,350
The DNA of any child
is made of two sets.

1406
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:54,180
Half the set belongs to the father..

1407
01:43:54,310 --> 01:43:55,810
..and the other half to the mother.

1408
01:43:56,270 --> 01:43:58,770
If we compare Ankur's DNA with yours..

1409
01:43:58,890 --> 01:44:00,520
..it will be a 50% exact match.

1410
01:44:00,810 --> 01:44:01,970
And that will prove..

1411
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:04,310
..that the vomit particles on
this thread belongs to Ankur.

1412
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:07,270
And if they prove in court that..

1413
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,970
..Ankur vomited before the operation.

1414
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:13,100
And those particles
stuck to this thread, then?

1415
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:15,180
If he had vomited
before the operation..

1416
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:17,180
..then his medical reports
would have anti-emetics..

1417
01:44:17,310 --> 01:44:19,100
..which is a
medicine to stop vomiting.

1418
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:20,270
Which is not there.

1419
01:44:20,350 --> 01:44:21,890
He never vomited before the operation.

1420
01:44:22,890 --> 01:44:24,560
And after the
operation he was in coma.

1421
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:26,970
He could've only have
vomited during the operation.

1422
01:44:27,310 --> 01:44:29,890
Romesh. You're a bloody genius.

1423
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:37,600
Your Honour. With your permission..

1424
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:39,770
..the prosecution requests
for four days of recess.

1425
01:44:39,890 --> 01:44:41,140
Only four days.

1426
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:42,890
And why do you want this time?

1427
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:45,270
I want to prepare
some more for this case.

1428
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:48,140
The court grants
prosecution four days time.

1429
01:44:49,180 --> 01:44:52,220
But, this time's being granted
for the benefit of this case.

1430
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:55,310
Not to push the hearing further.
- I assure you, My Lord.

1431
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:56,640
That won't happen.

1432
01:44:56,770 --> 01:44:58,600
The court is adjourned for four days.

1433
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:01,850
This is not a good sign.

1434
01:45:03,270 --> 01:45:04,430
She is up to something.

1435
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:06,770
Kajori didn't demand
time for no reason.

1436
01:45:09,270 --> 01:45:10,640
She's definitely found something.

1437
01:45:10,770 --> 01:45:11,810
What do you mean?

1438
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:14,930
What did they find?
- I don't have a clue.

1439
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:19,020
But, I don't want to look like
a fool in the court. - Then?

1440
01:45:20,970 --> 01:45:22,310
How will we find out?

1441
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:27,220
Rajiv, you don't want to
be embarrassed in the court.

1442
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:29,890
I don't want to be
embarrassed in front of everyone.

1443
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:32,520
Me and my company's
become the butt of jokes..

1444
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:34,100
..due to this case.

1445
01:45:35,890 --> 01:45:37,220
I don't want any more damage.

1446
01:45:38,140 --> 01:45:40,310
Find out what it is.
- I understand, sir.

1447
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,390
This game's going to
get a little dirty.

1448
01:45:46,310 --> 01:45:48,390
I suggest you two stay away from it.

1449
01:45:49,180 --> 01:45:50,850
Now, I'll do
whatever needs to be done.

1450
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:54,430
I've Kajori's number.

1451
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:57,810
Nandita's number must be
in the hospital records.

1452
01:45:59,310 --> 01:46:00,430
And Romesh..

1453
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,220
Does Romesh still has
the same number, Riya?

1454
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:12,430
Has it changed?
- No, sir. It hasn't.

1455
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:21,970
Go to the ward.
- Okay, sir.

1456
01:46:27,390 --> 01:46:30,310
Yes, Mallani.
- I've Romesh's cell phone records.

1457
01:46:31,770 --> 01:46:33,350
What's this Technomate Lab?

1458
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:36,470
He's been calling this place
many times in the last two days.

1459
01:46:36,850 --> 01:46:37,970
Technomate.

1460
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:41,140
It's a lab where DNA
fingerprinting is done.

1461
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:44,180
And there are few
such labs in our city.

1462
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:46,270
Any idea why he was
calling this place.

1463
01:46:46,350 --> 01:46:48,310
What's the point of DNA
fingerprinting in this..

1464
01:46:51,930 --> 01:46:55,890
Unless, he's found the vomit samples.

1465
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:59,470
Maybe? - And what if this
maybe turns to definitely?

1466
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:02,100
Then, Mallani, we're..

1467
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:21,810
This is a perfect match. Right.

1468
01:47:24,270 --> 01:47:25,350
Check it.

1469
01:47:26,270 --> 01:47:28,220
And, let's all leave.

1470
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:30,770
It's time to close the lab.
- Yeah, sure.

1471
01:47:30,890 --> 01:47:32,560
Just give me a second.
- Yeah. - Thank you.

1472
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:06,890
Oh, God!

1473
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:10,640
A car's been
following us, from the lab.

1474
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:15,930
Hurry up, hurry up.
- Step on it.

1475
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:32,310
Who's it?

1476
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:52,810
Oh, my God.
- Careful, careful.

1477
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:55,270
Careful..

1478
01:48:55,350 --> 01:48:56,640
Oh God, it's a blind lane.

1479
01:48:58,180 --> 01:48:59,310
Oh, no!

1480
01:48:59,390 --> 01:49:00,520
Get out! Get out. Quick. Fast.

1481
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:02,180
Run.

1482
01:49:02,270 --> 01:49:03,310
Just run.

1483
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:07,020
That way. There.

1484
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:30,930
I don't know what happened?
- No idea.

1485
01:49:31,060 --> 01:49:33,310
Everything was fine when I switched off
he computer last night.

1486
01:49:33,890 --> 01:49:37,350
This morning, there was
no data, no DNA samples.

1487
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:39,470
So, you don't have
another copy of that report.

1488
01:49:39,890 --> 01:49:41,850
And we can't get that
test done again? - No, man.

1489
01:49:41,970 --> 01:49:44,520
I am really sorry. All the samples
have been contaminated.

1490
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:46,470
But you must have some security.

1491
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:48,100
Some CCTV or something.

1492
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:49,430
You know, that's the thing.

1493
01:49:50,220 --> 01:49:52,560
All the footages from the
CCTV camera has been erased.

1494
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:54,850
I've know clue who was here.

1495
01:49:55,850 --> 01:49:58,520
All I know is, as of now
we've lost everything.

1496
01:49:58,930 --> 01:50:00,060
Okay.

1497
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:06,140
But this is criminal.

1498
01:50:06,270 --> 01:50:08,060
We can report this to the police.

1499
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:13,430
We can't prove a thing,
how will we prove this?

1500
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:17,140
She's right.

1501
01:50:17,270 --> 01:50:19,350
But it's a crime to
tamper with evidence.

1502
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:21,390
And they also attacked us last night.

1503
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:23,220
Yes. The law's there.

1504
01:50:24,270 --> 01:50:25,680
But we've no proof..

1505
01:50:25,810 --> 01:50:27,520
..to show that we had evidence.

1506
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:28,720
Meaning?

1507
01:50:29,850 --> 01:50:30,890
Is it all over?

1508
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:35,220
There's one thing that can be done.

1509
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:38,930
And only Romesh can do it.

1510
01:51:05,890 --> 01:51:09,560
Speaking to you can get me in trouble.

1511
01:51:10,470 --> 01:51:13,390
The hospital staff's here too.
- I know.

1512
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:15,810
Just two minutes.

1513
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:18,930
What is it?
- You must know.

1514
01:51:20,270 --> 01:51:25,680
We had evidence to put
you all away for very long.

1515
01:51:29,270 --> 01:51:30,390
But we don't have
that evidence anymore.

1516
01:51:31,850 --> 01:51:33,060
They've been snatched.

1517
01:51:34,810 --> 01:51:37,930
Romesh, I don't want to fight.
- I am not here to fight, Riya.

1518
01:51:39,470 --> 01:51:41,430
In fact, I'm here to make a request.

1519
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:47,270
It's your turn to
testify in the court tomorrow.

1520
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:51,850
Tell the truth, Riya.

1521
01:51:53,770 --> 01:51:55,390
You were in the
operation theatre that day.

1522
01:51:56,020 --> 01:51:58,220
You saw everything, heard everything.

1523
01:51:59,020 --> 01:52:01,220
You're the only witness to this crime.

1524
01:52:03,970 --> 01:52:05,140
My last hope.

1525
01:52:08,930 --> 01:52:10,390
Please, Riya, I beg of you.

1526
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:20,970
Swear on The Gita.
You'll only speak the truth..

1527
01:52:21,270 --> 01:52:22,810
..and nothing but the truth.

1528
01:52:24,390 --> 01:52:27,270
Yes. I will speak the truth.

1529
01:52:34,100 --> 01:52:38,560
Dr. Riya, you don't need to be scared.

1530
01:52:39,180 --> 01:52:40,520
We're with you.

1531
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:45,970
On the 9th of June this year,
were you present in the OT..

1532
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:50,600
..when Ankur was being operated on.

1533
01:52:52,810 --> 01:52:54,640
Yes. I was there.

1534
01:52:55,390 --> 01:52:58,020
What happened to
the child after the operation?

1535
01:53:00,770 --> 01:53:03,600
Dr. Riya, what happened to the child?

1536
01:53:04,270 --> 01:53:05,350
Tell us.

1537
01:53:08,770 --> 01:53:10,180
After the operation..

1538
01:53:23,390 --> 01:53:24,600
Speak up, Dr. Riya.

1539
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:26,680
Speak up.

1540
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:31,890
After the operation,
Ankur's lungs collapsed.

1541
01:53:59,430 --> 01:54:01,140
Your Honour,
the defense would like to move..

1542
01:54:01,270 --> 01:54:02,520
..for a motion of dismissal.

1543
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:05,850
This case is ruining the image
of Shekhawat General Hospital.

1544
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:08,270
And is keeping a busy
and important surgeon..

1545
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:09,810
..like Dr. Asthana away from his work.

1546
01:54:10,060 --> 01:54:11,850
This is nothing but a
waste of public money.

1547
01:54:17,890 --> 01:54:21,470
Since the prosecution
has no more witnesses..

1548
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:26,140
..and they couldn't prove
that Master Ankur Arora..

1549
01:54:26,270 --> 01:54:28,140
..died due to the
negligence of doctors.

1550
01:54:28,850 --> 01:54:33,310
So, I agree with the
defense and dismiss this case.

1551
01:54:33,930 --> 01:54:36,890
The case of Arora versus
Shekhawat General Hospital..

1552
01:54:37,020 --> 01:54:38,180
..stands dismissed.

1553
01:55:18,850 --> 01:55:19,970
Thank you.

1554
01:55:36,140 --> 01:55:39,430
Riya. What is this?

1555
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:43,180
You're leaving your
internship incomplete.

1556
01:55:45,350 --> 01:55:47,680
Yes, sir.
- What nonsense?

1557
01:55:49,430 --> 01:55:51,180
You did so much for us.

1558
01:55:52,180 --> 01:55:54,060
We can do much for you in return.

1559
01:55:55,100 --> 01:55:57,100
We can make you the top
surgeon of this hospital.

1560
01:55:59,060 --> 01:56:01,770
The favor that you did to us..
- Favor?

1561
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:04,890
What favor, sir?

1562
01:56:06,850 --> 01:56:10,270
I lied. I betrayed my profession.

1563
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:12,930
I cannot stay here.

1564
01:56:13,890 --> 01:56:16,850
This burden..
- What burden?

1565
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:19,850
What crime did you commit?

1566
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:21,850
What did you do wrong?

1567
01:56:23,140 --> 01:56:26,060
We sir, not me?

1568
01:56:31,140 --> 01:56:34,060
We just made one mistake, Riya.

1569
01:56:35,350 --> 01:56:36,520
Just one.

1570
01:56:37,220 --> 01:56:38,810
And it led to this chaos.

1571
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:42,350
And, so what if we made a mistake?

1572
01:56:44,020 --> 01:56:45,270
Do only humans make mistakes?

1573
01:56:46,430 --> 01:56:47,560
Doesn't God make mistakes?

1574
01:56:48,140 --> 01:56:49,600
Still, we bow before Him.

1575
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:51,600
I..

1576
01:56:52,850 --> 01:56:53,970
I am just fed up of this nonsense.

1577
01:56:54,100 --> 01:56:56,470
But, you're not God.
- I am God!

1578
01:56:57,810 --> 01:56:59,430
I pulled thousands of
souls back from death..

1579
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:01,890
..the ones your God
was allowing to die.

1580
01:57:03,770 --> 01:57:05,560
I've the same power as He does.

1581
01:57:07,140 --> 01:57:09,140
If I should be
punished for my mistake..

1582
01:57:09,270 --> 01:57:11,390
..then why do we spare Him?

1583
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:15,180
I just forgot to use a tube.

1584
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:17,720
I forgot to get some
biscuits out of his stomach.

1585
01:57:17,970 --> 01:57:19,100
So, I am the culprit?

1586
01:57:19,810 --> 01:57:20,850
And Him?

1587
01:57:22,220 --> 01:57:24,640
He kills so many
children before they're born.

1588
01:57:26,270 --> 01:57:28,560
Or, makes them a cripple.

1589
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:30,310
He's not accounted for that.

1590
01:57:33,850 --> 01:57:35,140
Why do you spare Him?

1591
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:36,810
He's God!

1592
01:57:39,270 --> 01:57:41,350
When your God gives pain to people..

1593
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:43,930
..infects them with sicknesses,
they come to me..

1594
01:57:44,060 --> 01:57:45,390
..and I cure their pain.

1595
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:48,020
So, if he's God then
I am a bloody doctor!

1596
01:57:53,020 --> 01:57:57,020
I am as powerful as
your so-called God.

1597
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:02,850
If he's no criminal even after
making thousands of mistakes..

1598
01:58:02,970 --> 01:58:05,430
..then for making one
mistake neither am I.

1599
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:08,100
So, yes, I am God!

1600
01:58:08,220 --> 01:58:11,430
Get that clear! I am God!

1601
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:30,350
Fine, sir.

1602
01:58:32,270 --> 01:58:36,310
If you consider
yourself God, you can do that.

1603
01:58:37,930 --> 01:58:41,270
But right now, I'm finding it
difficult to be a human being.

1604
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:46,720
Thank you and goodbye.

1605
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:15,720
Hello, doctor.

1606
01:59:30,140 --> 01:59:33,680
Aren't you the same
doctor that's on TV..

1607
01:59:35,180 --> 01:59:36,720
I am God!

1608
01:59:37,970 --> 01:59:40,270
I pulled thousands of
souls back from death..

1609
01:59:40,390 --> 01:59:41,970
..the ones your God
was allowing to die.

1610
01:59:43,770 --> 01:59:45,640
I've the same power as He does.

1611
01:59:45,770 --> 01:59:47,930
If I should be
punished for my mistake..

1612
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:49,270
..then why do we spare Him?

1613
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:52,310
I just forgot to use a tube.

1614
01:59:52,770 --> 01:59:54,850
I forgot to get some
biscuits out of his stomach.

1615
01:59:55,180 --> 01:59:56,270
So, I am the culprit?

1616
01:59:56,970 --> 01:59:58,140
And Him?

1617
01:59:59,270 --> 02:00:01,850
He kills so many
children before they're born.

1618
02:00:02,890 --> 02:00:04,930
When your God gives pain to people..

1619
02:00:05,270 --> 02:00:07,520
..infects them with sicknesses,
they come to me..

1620
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:09,020
..and I cure their pain.

1621
02:00:09,140 --> 02:00:11,470
So, if he's God then
I am a bloody doctor!

1622
02:00:12,220 --> 02:00:13,390
Doctor?
- Not now, later.

1623
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:15,600
Just two minutes.
- Please go.

1624
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:24,520
I am as powerful as
your so called God.

1625
02:00:26,850 --> 02:00:28,520
Hello.
- Dr. Asthana speaking.

1626
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:30,060
Give the phone to your sir.
- Yes, sir.

1627
02:00:31,310 --> 02:00:33,890
Sir. Dr. Asthana.

1628
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:40,220
Sir's in the bathroom.
- No need to say anything.

1629
02:00:40,930 --> 02:00:42,470
Tell him I've understood everything.

1630
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:44,140
Coward!

1631
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:47,600
Get out of the way.

1632
02:01:03,890 --> 02:01:05,430
Dr. Asthana, we've a
warrant against you.

1633
02:01:18,140 --> 02:01:19,930
Dr. Riya will please stand.

1634
02:01:24,020 --> 02:01:27,140
Dr. Riya has broken her
oath taken in the court.

1635
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:28,930
Lied to the court.

1636
02:01:29,430 --> 02:01:33,180
That was just a way
to expose the truth.

1637
02:01:33,680 --> 02:01:36,100
The court respects her intentions.

1638
02:01:36,970 --> 02:01:40,390
Since she swore in the court of law..

1639
02:01:41,100 --> 02:01:44,770
..the court fines her Rs.20,000.

1640
02:01:49,140 --> 02:01:51,430
Shekhawat Hospital is
guilty of negligence..

1641
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:53,020
..beyond reasonable doubt.

1642
02:01:53,310 --> 02:01:55,390
And the court, on this day..

1643
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:58,350
..12th December, 2012..

1644
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,850
..orders Shekhawat Hospital..

1645
02:02:01,270 --> 02:02:05,520
..to pay a compensation of Rs.10
crores to Ankur Arora's mother..

1646
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:07,560
..within the next 15 days.

1647
02:02:10,180 --> 02:02:12,890
And, the court finds Dr.
Asthana guilty..

1648
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:14,970
..for Ankur Arora's death.

1649
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:17,310
And sentences him to
three years of imprisonment..

1650
02:02:17,430 --> 02:02:19,270
..under section 304.

1651
02:02:19,350 --> 02:02:20,680
The court is dismissed.

1652
02:02:20,810 --> 02:02:26,720
"Everything seems still."

1653
02:02:26,970 --> 02:02:32,850
"The moment has
stopped where you did."

1654
02:02:33,270 --> 02:02:39,640
"You're lost in yourself."

1655
02:02:39,770 --> 02:02:46,020
"You don't have any memory of me."

1656
02:02:46,390 --> 02:02:49,520
"Life, better mend your ways."

1657
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:52,600
"Better change for the good."

1658
02:02:52,890 --> 02:02:55,560
"Have pity, don't be so harsh."

1659
02:02:55,680 --> 02:02:59,310
"Don't be so stubborn."

1660
02:02:59,390 --> 02:03:02,270
"Why do people change?"

1661
02:03:02,350 --> 02:03:05,520
"Why aren't they always with us?"

1662
02:03:05,640 --> 02:03:11,770
"Life, you're jealous of my dreams."

1663
02:03:11,890 --> 02:03:17,600
"Why aren't you like your image?"

1664
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:25,350
"Why aren't you like
what you seem to be?"

1665
02:04:02,970 --> 02:04:08,810
"You've so many complaints with me."

1666
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:15,310
"Our love's lost in these distances."

1667
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:22,020
"I've been living by the moment."

1668
02:04:22,140 --> 02:04:28,390
"Why does life has
so many complaints?"

1669
02:04:28,850 --> 02:04:31,890
"You keep reminding us."

1670
02:04:32,020 --> 02:04:35,100
"Reminding us every moment."

1671
02:04:35,220 --> 02:04:41,430
"Brings us close to you."

1672
02:04:41,560 --> 02:04:44,680
"Why do people change?"

1673
02:04:44,810 --> 02:04:47,850
"Why aren't they always with us?"

1674
02:04:47,970 --> 02:04:54,390
"Life, you're jealous of my dreams."

1675
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:57,560
"What's this void?"

1676
02:04:57,680 --> 02:05:00,850
"It torments the heart."

1677
02:05:00,970 --> 02:05:06,850
"And makes the heart weep."

1678
02:05:06,970 --> 02:05:12,970
"Why aren't you like your image?"

1679
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:19,720
"Why aren't you like
what you seem to be?"
