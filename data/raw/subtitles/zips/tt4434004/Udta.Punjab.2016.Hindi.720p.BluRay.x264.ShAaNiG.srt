1
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:17,585
Take out the packet.

2
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:23,960
Come on, Shamsher. Go for it!

3
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:41,960
Hurry up.

4
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:36,626
<i>Look! Look! Look! Look...</i>

5
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:40,585
<i>Look up you wasted folk,
Right here into my face.</i>

6
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:44,126
<i>Hold your arms tight,
I'm shooting up this place!</i>

7
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:47,876
<i>Life's a thrill ride,
I'm gonna hit top</i> speed

8
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:51,376
<i>Freedom and liberty,
It's all in the weed.</i>

9
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:54,835
<i>Don't shy away from high,
Screw those asking why!</i>

10
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:58,376
<i>If they don't let you try,
Just shoot them in the eye!</i>

11
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:01,960
<i>I'll sing in my jammies,
I'll sing in the nude,</i>

12
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:05,460
<i>Got a problem?
Get off my hood!</i>

13
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:08,960
<i>I am what I am,
The coolest dude!</i>

14
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:12,418
<i>Don't mess with me,
I'm an eagle on the prowl.</i>

15
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:14,126
<i>I'm the daddy of swag,
Tsunami unleashed!</i>

16
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:16,043
<i>Fans across the world,
No time to pause.</i>

17
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,626
<i>All groove to my song,
Thugs or cops alike.</i>

18
00:06:17,793 --> 00:06:19,501
<i>Don't bullshit me,
I can read the future.</i>

19
00:06:19,501 --> 00:06:21,460
<i>You follow your god,
I need no nurture.</i>

20
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:49,668
<i>Oh darling white one,
Oh darling white one,</i>

21
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:52,460
<i>You're our beloved happiness!</i>

22
00:06:52,668 --> 00:06:56,126
<i>Oh sweet sugar, oh sweet sugar,</i>

23
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:59,001
<i>One sniff is eternal bliss.</i>

24
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:02,210
<i>Punjab is flying high!</i>

25
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:12,668
<i>Oh brother Romeo</i>

26
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:15,335
<i>This is your true Juliet!</i>

27
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:18,501
<i>Draw up that line,</i>

28
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:22,001
<i>Snort the heaven inside.</i>

29
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:28,085
<i>Punjab is flying high!</i>

30
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:52,001
<i>They shall soar,</i>

31
00:07:52,543 --> 00:07:55,668
<i>The ones who sniff it all.</i>

32
00:07:55,668 --> 00:07:59,085
<i>You shall win,</i>

33
00:07:59,251 --> 00:08:03,960
<i>And will meet your
Lucy in the sky.</i>

34
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:06,876
<i>Punjab is flying high!</i>

35
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:24,460
<i>She is white but
She speaks Punjabi.</i>

36
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:27,876
<i>She rules the mighty state of Punjab!</i>

37
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:31,251
<i>She's a ball of fire,
Roll up in her charm.</i>

38
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:34,960
<i>Shoot up your nerves,
Her love's crawling in</i>

39
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:41,960
<i>Her love is crawling in!
Her love is crawling in!</i>

40
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:45,376
<i>In the country, markets,
She's everywhere</i>

41
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:48,835
<i>She's a friend to
Traders of the dark world</i>

42
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:52,501
<i>In weddings, funerals,
She's everywhere</i>

43
00:08:52,876 --> 00:08:56,126
<i>In parties, dark alleys,
She quietly sneaks in</i>

44
00:08:56,293 --> 00:08:59,376
<i>She cuts across boundaries,
across times</i>

45
00:08:59,793 --> 00:09:03,001
She's <i>always there,
In your living, in dying</i>

46
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,710
<i>Trade your life with her euphoria.</i>

47
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:06,460
<i>It's her time now.</i>

48
00:09:06,626 --> 00:09:08,126
<i>Boy, girl, woman, man,
You can't escape her</i>

49
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:10,210
<i>She'll strike a blow,
You scream with joy!</i>

50
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:20,126
<i>Like a kite,</i>

51
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:26,085
<i>Punjab is flying in the air!</i>

52
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:34,126
<i>A Punjab of myriad colors,</i>

53
00:09:34,918 --> 00:09:41,376
<i>Has blown up in white.</i>

54
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:54,376
<i>WELCOME TO PUNJAB!
(THE LAND OF FIVE RIVERS)</i>

55
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:47,001
Hello...

56
00:10:47,418 --> 00:10:50,626
This is Bhandi speaking...

57
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:55,001
Told you not to get
Shamsher along.

58
00:10:55,293 --> 00:10:57,626
The loser can't aim.

59
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,501
You think I have
nothing better to do?

60
00:11:02,418 --> 00:11:03,626
I can't find it.

61
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:08,501
Just can't!
You are making a fool out of me.

62
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,210
I don't have time for all this.

63
00:11:13,043 --> 00:11:15,251
Oh no, sister fucker!!!
Patrol officers are here!

64
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:23,001
I'll be busted, assholes!

65
00:11:55,793 --> 00:11:57,876
<i>Tommy Singh in the house!</i>

66
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:04,543
<i>Listen up!</i>

67
00:12:04,543 --> 00:12:08,001
<i>Tommy's got a tongue
sharp like Ecstasy.</i>

68
00:12:08,251 --> 00:12:11,376
<i>Tommy's lips taste
like Heroin's intimacy.</i>

69
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:15,126
<i>Tommy's c*&k is white
as Coke's supremacy!</i>

70
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:19,001
<i>Tommy's c*&k is white
as Coke's supremacy!</i>

71
00:12:19,293 --> 00:12:26,626
<i>C*&k-coke, coke-c*&k,
C*&k-coke, oh yeah, I am so high!</i>

72
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:45,585
Shut it down!

73
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:49,418
Bro, this is fucking killer stuff!

74
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:51,210
I am telling you, we are
going to kill it, the market is...

75
00:12:51,418 --> 00:12:53,751
Coke-c*&k, coke-c*&e...
It's going to be an anthem, man.

76
00:12:53,751 --> 00:12:55,501
I can see it.
I can so fucking see it, man.

77
00:12:55,668 --> 00:12:58,418
Yo, bro! Coke-c*&k is the stuff.
Coke- c*&k is the scene

78
00:12:58,418 --> 00:13:00,001
This is the international stuff.

79
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:02,126
I tell you,
this is going to be the next swag!

80
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:05,418
UK, Canada...
Tommy, you are a bloody poet!

81
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:06,376
'GABRU!'

82
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:11,001
Isn't it a super hit?

83
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,501
Can <i>we</i> hear the rest of the songs?

84
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,501
The thing is... it's work in progress.

85
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:21,460
Sunday... probably Monday...
Wednesday it'll be done for sure!

86
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:24,210
Have been hearing that
since three months.

87
00:13:24,418 --> 00:13:26,418
The release date has been
pushed twice already.

88
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:28,376
The hoardings have gone up twice.

89
00:13:28,793 --> 00:13:31,960
You know what?
We didn't sign up for this.

90
00:13:32,293 --> 00:13:35,251
Son, hear me out.
Could you talk to him...

91
00:13:36,293 --> 00:13:37,626
I'm really sorry.

92
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,751
We'll just have to call
the deal off, yeah?

93
00:13:41,043 --> 00:13:42,626
Bye!
- We can work something out.

94
00:13:42,793 --> 00:13:48,376
I've been away for dozen years,
brought myself a little frock.

95
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:53,460
Tommy sets off a party,
as he yanks his white c*&k!

96
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:58,876
Coke-c*&k, coke-c*&k...

97
00:13:59,126 --> 00:14:03,585
Time to let your mind unblock,
Coke-c*&k, coke-c*&k...

98
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:10,710
Those who bug, give 'em a sock.
Coke-c*&k, coke-c*&k...

99
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:14,251
<i>Motherfuckers!</i>

100
00:14:17,043 --> 00:14:18,626
The deal is off!

101
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,001
Juggle your nuts now!

102
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:29,251
<i>Fuck!</i>

103
00:14:33,668 --> 00:14:35,876
Hello, Tommy. Are you there? Hello.

104
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,876
You fired me, asshole!

105
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:40,626
No no, Tommy.
You are misunderstanding me.

106
00:14:41,168 --> 00:14:41,626
Yes, you did.

107
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:45,126
No, Tommy.
Don't say that. You know...

108
00:14:45,293 --> 00:14:47,001
it just wasn't working out... okay?

109
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:50,501
Wasn't working out?
Sister fucker, who am I?

110
00:14:51,001 --> 00:14:54,085
Your girlfriend?
Am I your fucking girlfriend?

111
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:56,501
What do you want me to say, Tommy?

112
00:14:56,793 --> 00:14:57,501
Say it to my face.

113
00:14:58,418 --> 00:14:59,710
You fired me.

114
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:01,126
Say it.

115
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:04,251
Say it.
- Alright, man.

116
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:07,126
I fired you. Yeah, got it?

117
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:10,376
He says that he's fired me.

118
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,376
<i>He fired me, fucker!</i>

119
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:15,001
Nobody fires Tommy!

120
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:17,085
Alright.

121
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,710
Brother, brother...
- Nobody.

122
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,376
Give it to him, fucker!

123
00:15:20,376 --> 00:15:23,376
Speedy, you sister fucker,
listen to me!

124
00:15:23,793 --> 00:15:27,960
Tommy's got record labels queuing
till Jalandhar & Chandigarh.

125
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:31,251
Only Tommy fires Tommy.
Are you fucking Tommy?

126
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:33,126
Listen up, fucker!
- What the fuck are you laughing at?

127
00:15:33,126 --> 00:15:38,251
Fucker, you Whatsapp dad begging
for a concert with Tommy?

128
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:40,751
Suck on that!
- You shit!

129
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:43,126
Fucking shit!
- And what is your worth?

130
00:15:43,126 --> 00:15:44,501
The best record labels in
the world want Tommy!

131
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:46,585
Not you!
You bloody ear-grease!

132
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:49,501
Who's the GABRU!?
- Who's your Daddy?!

133
00:15:49,501 --> 00:15:51,460
Ask your hot wife who's the GABRU!?

134
00:15:52,043 --> 00:15:54,418
Speedy, we'll split
your behind open...

135
00:15:54,418 --> 00:15:57,126
and do a concert in there,
- You fucker!

136
00:15:57,626 --> 00:15:58,501
You!!

137
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:01,710
I fire you. I double fire you.

138
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:04,626
Speedy, you bought an S-class?

139
00:16:04,626 --> 00:16:06,960
Move... move!

140
00:16:11,043 --> 00:16:12,501
You fucker!

141
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:16,626
Nobody fires Tommy!

142
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:17,876
Be careful.

143
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,126
Only Tommy fires Tommy!

144
00:16:19,293 --> 00:16:20,626
I'm the GABRU!

145
00:16:21,168 --> 00:16:24,001
Speedy, <i>l'll</i> fuck you over!

146
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:25,835
Ram into his bloody car!

147
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:28,001
Overtake him from the right
and make him stop!

148
00:16:28,543 --> 00:16:31,335
Speedy, you motherfucker!

149
00:16:40,043 --> 00:16:41,751
Ambush his damn car, fucker!

150
00:17:11,418 --> 00:17:12,126
Be careful, bro.

151
00:17:12,293 --> 00:17:14,001
Fuck, are you crazy?

152
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:16,376
Do you find this funny?

153
00:17:17,043 --> 00:17:20,085
Do you? The deal's off
and you're laughing?

154
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:23,001
You are past your expiry date, babe.

155
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,335
It's over.

156
00:17:25,668 --> 00:17:27,585
Really?
- Really.

157
00:17:27,918 --> 00:17:31,085
And so are you, Tommy.
So are you!

158
00:17:47,418 --> 00:17:49,501
Why are the lights off?

159
00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:52,501
Switch on the lights.

160
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:54,126
Anyone home?

161
00:17:55,793 --> 00:18:02,751
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!

162
00:18:02,751 --> 00:18:06,251
Tommy, the GABRU!

163
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:10,126
Party!

164
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:19,376
There are cities in Mexico...

165
00:18:19,751 --> 00:18:21,126
where the cops can't put a foot in.

166
00:18:21,543 --> 00:18:22,251
Really?

167
00:18:22,418 --> 00:18:24,126
Drug lords are the bloody law.

168
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:27,376
Don't get me wrong...

169
00:18:27,543 --> 00:18:30,085
but what have the police done here?

170
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,335
The situation is the same.

171
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:37,251
The situation is the same?
- Yes, brother.

172
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:41,876
Stop that sister fucker!

173
00:18:42,168 --> 00:18:42,960
Stop him.

174
00:18:44,793 --> 00:18:46,626
Stop him!
- Get him down.

175
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,960
Get down.

176
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:02,210
Brilliant!

177
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:03,751
Where are your papers?

178
00:19:05,168 --> 00:19:06,376
It is election time.

179
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:08,626
Driving without papers, asshole?

180
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:12,126
Look at the packaging.

181
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:13,835
With proper branding.

182
00:19:14,293 --> 00:19:16,001
First it was those mini-vans

183
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:17,251
now they're getting them in trucks.

184
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:20,501
This is what they call progress.

185
00:19:21,418 --> 00:19:23,126
<i>Green revolution,</i> part <i>two.</i>

186
00:19:23,418 --> 00:19:24,960
But what about our progress?

187
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:27,876
Our cut is still the same.
Fucking 10,000 rupees!

188
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,501
Can <i>we</i> get anything in 10,000?
- No.

189
00:19:30,918 --> 00:19:33,876
I think they've taken
the Punjab police for granted.

190
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:36,376
There's no regard
for law and order here.

191
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,251
If this continues,
Punjab will become Mexico.

192
00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:42,126
Sister fucker, you will turn Punjab into Mexico?
- No, sir.

193
00:19:42,126 --> 00:19:43,501
I will not, sir!

194
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:44,751
I feel he surely will.

195
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:47,626
No, sir. I will not
turn it to a Mexico. Never!

196
00:19:47,793 --> 00:19:50,668
Tell your boss to up
our commission.

197
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:53,126
It's a red light here!

198
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:54,251
No green light.

199
00:19:54,418 --> 00:19:56,751
Yes, sir.
- Fuck off!

200
00:19:57,751 --> 00:20:00,085
Make it quick... move!

201
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:03,876
See... cop power?

202
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:05,376
Yes.

203
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:08,960
Who is calling?
Yes, sir.

204
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,710
<i>I'll</i> be there... right away.

205
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:14,626
Go to hell!

206
00:20:16,543 --> 00:20:17,335
Let's go, Sartaj.

207
00:20:17,543 --> 00:20:20,710
<i>I'll</i> show you what
'law and order' can do.

208
00:20:21,376 --> 00:20:26,751
<i>"Baby, come sit in my car
We'll celebrate your happy birthday</i>

209
00:20:26,918 --> 00:20:31,751
<i>"Baby, come sit in my car
We'll celebrate your happy birthday</i>

210
00:20:39,043 --> 00:20:42,376
<i>Unleash the dog
Till the dawn is to crack.</i>

211
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:50,960
<i>Set the world on fire,
Time to payback.</i>

212
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:58,335
<i>Unleash the dog
Till the dawn is to crack.</i>

213
00:20:58,793 --> 00:21:02,751
<i>Set the world on fire,
Time to payback.</i>

214
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:06,751
<i>Infinite lines of coke,
Who keeps a track?</i>

215
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:07,751
The cops are here!

216
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,626
<i>Punjab is flying high!</i>

217
00:21:10,793 --> 00:21:13,835
Stop this nonsense.
- Party is over!

218
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:16,751
Sir! This is a birthday...
- Stop it!

219
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:18,251
Sir, this is a birthday party.

220
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:19,251
Where is Tommy?

221
00:21:19,251 --> 00:21:21,751
Sir, Tommy is not here.
It is a birthday party.

222
00:21:21,751 --> 00:21:22,751
Where is Tommy?

223
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:24,960
Sir, Tommy is not here.
Back off!

224
00:21:25,543 --> 00:21:27,168
Sir, Tommy is not here.

225
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,626
He's lying.
- Liar!

226
00:21:28,626 --> 00:21:30,585
I am not lying. I swear on you.

227
00:21:31,543 --> 00:21:33,126
What happened?

228
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,960
Gracing us with your presence at <i>3</i> am?

229
00:21:36,543 --> 00:21:37,710
Is there a problem?

230
00:21:38,168 --> 00:21:40,293
Get some tea and cookies.
We've got guests.

231
00:21:40,293 --> 00:21:43,126
No need for that.
We have orders from the top.

232
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:47,251
Get Tommy here. Or all these
sister fuckers will gets arrested.

233
00:21:48,168 --> 00:21:52,376
Tommy?
He left for London yesterday.

234
00:22:34,126 --> 00:22:35,126
Who's the GABRU?

235
00:22:37,668 --> 00:22:39,043
I'm the GABRU.

236
00:22:39,043 --> 00:22:39,751
What?

237
00:22:41,043 --> 00:22:41,960
I didn't hear that.

238
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:45,085
I'm the GABRU.

239
00:22:48,043 --> 00:22:49,001
Haven't you eaten?

240
00:22:49,376 --> 00:22:50,751
I'm the GABRU.

241
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:52,501
I still can't hear you.

242
00:22:52,668 --> 00:22:58,626
I'm the GABRU.

243
00:23:00,793 --> 00:23:04,126
Didn't Tommy go to London?

244
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:08,626
So apparently he is here.

245
00:23:08,918 --> 00:23:13,335
But he has given up cocaine.
Doesn't even touch it.

246
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:20,210
Listen up sister fuckers!
I am the fucking GABRU!

247
00:23:28,293 --> 00:23:30,126
Tommy Singh's arrest is
the latest development...

248
00:23:30,293 --> 00:23:33,585
in the drug crisis that has been
plaguing Punjab for the last few years...

249
00:23:33,793 --> 00:23:38,126
And we have with us eminent politician
MP - Mr. Maninder Brar

250
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:41,001
Instead of taking concrete
steps to tackle the drug menace...

251
00:23:41,251 --> 00:23:43,835
Why is the government going
for soft targets like Tommy Singh.

252
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:45,501
People like Tommy Singh -

253
00:23:45,668 --> 00:23:49,043
they are the ones who are encouraging
drug addiction in our society

254
00:23:49,043 --> 00:23:52,085
with their music,
with their choice of lifestyle.

255
00:23:52,751 --> 00:23:55,210
Look at the kind of videos
they are making.

256
00:23:56,126 --> 00:24:00,168
I think the youth of Punjab deserves
a better role model than Tommy Singh.

257
00:24:00,168 --> 00:24:01,001
Bloody phoney!

258
00:24:01,168 --> 00:24:04,001
- The milk's come to a boil.
Turn off the stove!

259
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:05,251
- Please understand this.

260
00:24:06,251 --> 00:24:06,876
Breakfast!

261
00:24:07,293 --> 00:24:09,585
Drop Balli off to college.
He's still asleep.

262
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:11,418
Good morning to you also!

263
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:16,376
Phagwara's boy transformed from
Punjab's Gabru to a menace to society.

264
00:24:17,793 --> 00:24:18,376
Greetings.

265
00:24:18,543 --> 00:24:21,585
Greetings, son. You ready?

266
00:24:22,418 --> 00:24:23,501
Good morning, grandma.

267
00:24:23,668 --> 00:24:25,251
Bless you, son.

268
00:24:25,251 --> 00:24:26,960
I am very worried about Balli.

269
00:24:27,418 --> 00:24:30,001
He wears sunglasses even at home.

270
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,376
Even at home?
- Doesn't study at all.

271
00:24:31,376 --> 00:24:32,710
Let me talk to him.

272
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:34,960
Balli!

273
00:24:36,251 --> 00:24:37,126
Balli!

274
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:39,501
Balli!

275
00:24:43,251 --> 00:24:43,876
Get ready.

276
00:24:44,668 --> 00:24:45,376
Aren't you late for college?

277
00:24:46,793 --> 00:24:47,751
And remove this idiot's poster.

278
00:24:51,293 --> 00:24:53,626
With your precious vote,

279
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:57,251
make Rajveer Singh Pehlwan win.

280
00:24:57,418 --> 00:25:01,085
His victory is yours as well.

281
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:05,835
Please vote for him!

282
00:25:06,168 --> 00:25:09,585
Vote for Rajveer Singh!

283
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:22,376
Listen...

284
00:25:23,168 --> 00:25:23,876
Come here...

285
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:28,751
Need money?

286
00:25:33,126 --> 00:25:35,501
If I find you at a coffee shop,
<i>l'll</i> thrash you.

287
00:25:37,918 --> 00:25:39,001
Thank you!

288
00:25:50,043 --> 00:25:54,335
Yeah, I'm on my way.
I"m getting it.

289
00:25:57,668 --> 00:25:58,626
Give me two today.

290
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:08,710
Faster.

291
00:26:11,668 --> 00:26:13,126
Greetings.

292
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,251
Greetings. How are you?

293
00:26:20,918 --> 00:26:23,043
Why? You took very long.

294
00:26:23,043 --> 00:26:26,335
You know, Punjab roads are a mess.

295
00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:29,751
Here's the stuff you asked for.

296
00:26:29,918 --> 00:26:32,626
This one is white
and this is the pink stuff.

297
00:26:34,168 --> 00:26:37,876
This one is for five grand
and this is for 10.

298
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:39,460
This one is very good as well.

299
00:26:39,626 --> 00:26:41,376
Try it once

300
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:43,876
and you'll surely ask for more!

301
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:49,501
What are you doing here?

302
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:52,626
My stomach is hurting.

303
00:26:53,293 --> 00:26:54,501
I need to go to the doctor.

304
00:26:54,668 --> 00:26:56,543
Get back by 12 o'clock.

305
00:26:56,543 --> 00:26:58,001
Or <i>I'll</i> cut your entire day's pay.

306
00:26:58,293 --> 00:26:59,501
Run along.

307
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:01,626
There's a shortage.

308
00:27:02,293 --> 00:27:03,626
Check the stuff.

309
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:15,251
That soap. The red one.

310
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:16,626
The one on top?

311
00:27:22,876 --> 00:27:25,251
There used to be a huge crowd

312
00:27:25,418 --> 00:27:26,626
at the tea stall earlier.

313
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:28,251
Who drinks tea these days?

314
00:27:28,543 --> 00:27:31,460
They are all drugged out at the ruins.

315
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:41,876
Did you see Tommy's pose?

316
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:44,251
Take that, yo, sister fucker!

317
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:46,835
His brother caught Tommy.

318
00:27:47,293 --> 00:27:48,835
Did-k!

319
00:27:52,376 --> 00:27:53,001
Idiot!

320
00:27:55,168 --> 00:27:58,835
Don't take it to heart, my love.

321
00:28:02,418 --> 00:28:03,626
Who are you?

322
00:28:04,293 --> 00:28:05,751
What are you looking at?

323
00:28:07,793 --> 00:28:08,960
Do you want stuff?

324
00:28:10,043 --> 00:28:11,251
What do you have?

325
00:28:12,168 --> 00:28:12,960
Powder.

326
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:15,210
Heroin?

327
00:28:15,418 --> 00:28:17,251
What?
- Heroin?

328
00:28:17,501 --> 00:28:19,376
Yes. That. Heroin.

329
00:28:20,251 --> 00:28:22,001
I don't have any money. Ask them.

330
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:24,585
You ask them. And take a commission.

331
00:28:26,543 --> 00:28:27,376
How much?

332
00:28:28,168 --> 00:28:29,210
How much can you offer?

333
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:30,626
3000 is the going rate.

334
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,001
How much do you have?

335
00:28:33,251 --> 00:28:34,210
Three.

336
00:28:34,418 --> 00:28:36,251
Come tomorrow.
<i>I'll</i> have it arranged.

337
00:28:36,418 --> 00:28:37,376
Full three grams, right?

338
00:28:37,626 --> 00:28:38,376
Kilos!

339
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:41,501
Three kilos!

340
00:28:42,168 --> 00:28:44,751
Where did you get that much stuff?

341
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:46,835
Do you really want it?
Or should I leave?

342
00:28:49,001 --> 00:28:50,710
Nobody can buy it here.

343
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:54,126
There is someone in town.
Raja, he is...

344
00:28:54,126 --> 00:28:55,251
Give me his mobile...

345
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:57,751
Number...

346
00:28:59,376 --> 00:29:03,585
9988... I will take 10 percent.

347
00:29:03,751 --> 00:29:05,460
What?
- 10 percent. 10!

348
00:29:05,668 --> 00:29:06,876
No. Five percent.

349
00:29:09,251 --> 00:29:11,001
Alright)!-

350
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,376
He's back.

351
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:16,876
Brother of a cop!

352
00:29:18,668 --> 00:29:21,085
Again... already?

353
00:29:21,418 --> 00:29:22,210
Easy, bro!

354
00:29:22,876 --> 00:29:24,126
Give it an hour at least.

355
00:29:24,376 --> 00:29:26,376
Get lost.

356
00:29:27,043 --> 00:29:29,126
Don't act like a roadie, bro!

357
00:29:35,168 --> 00:29:37,251
Balli...! Balli...!

358
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:03,585
Give me the blood pressure set. Hurry!

359
00:30:05,543 --> 00:30:07,876
Is that what you do in college?

360
00:30:14,418 --> 00:30:15,626
Balli?

361
00:30:16,168 --> 00:30:17,335
Doctor...

362
00:30:17,876 --> 00:30:19,251
Is he going to make it?

363
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:20,376
Wait outside.

364
00:30:20,543 --> 00:30:22,001
The doctor is coming. Please.

365
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:24,876
So call the doctor. Who is the doctor?

366
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:26,126
Please wait outside.
- Balli...

367
00:30:26,293 --> 00:30:28,126
Inform the traffic police.

368
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:32,626
Turn him on his side.
How many times should I tell you?

369
00:30:40,043 --> 00:30:42,085
Open your eyes, kiddo.

370
00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:45,210
Show me the readings.

371
00:30:49,668 --> 00:30:51,001
Get the IV line started.

372
00:30:51,293 --> 00:30:53,626
Prepare a Naloxone injection.
Double dose.

373
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:54,751
Madam...

374
00:30:56,043 --> 00:30:57,001
Will he be okay?

375
00:30:57,543 --> 00:30:58,960
Please wait outside.

376
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:02,251
Please wait outside. Please.

377
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:06,626
If you have any sort of addiction -

378
00:31:06,793 --> 00:31:10,043
alcohol or drugs
- you just let us know.

379
00:31:10,043 --> 00:31:13,043
We will get you off any addiction.

380
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:15,918
Cough syrup, smack or heroin...

381
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:18,376
we have a solution...

382
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,085
You can have it

383
00:31:20,876 --> 00:31:22,251
Give it to your mate

384
00:31:22,418 --> 00:31:23,626
To your family.

385
00:31:23,876 --> 00:31:25,376
We will cure everyone.

386
00:31:26,376 --> 00:31:29,251
Madam, thank you.

387
00:31:31,918 --> 00:31:34,543
What did he have? Heroin?

388
00:31:34,543 --> 00:31:36,251
Hard to say right now.

389
00:31:36,418 --> 00:31:38,710
But he's been doing it for a while.

390
00:31:38,918 --> 00:31:40,126
Heavy dosage.

391
00:31:40,126 --> 00:31:42,126
No, madam.
The boys must have forced him.

392
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,001
My Balli isn't the kind.

393
00:31:46,126 --> 00:31:47,210
Have you seen his hands?

394
00:31:48,168 --> 00:31:50,460
His veins are turning blue,
thanks to the needles.

395
00:31:51,793 --> 00:31:55,376
"My boy is not like that,
it's the others!"

396
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:58,376
Madam...

397
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,335
Madam...

398
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:04,960
Sorry, madam. I had no idea.

399
00:32:07,251 --> 00:32:08,876
I was just checking, madam...

400
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:10,751
Will he be able to give it up?

401
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:12,001
It is up to him.

402
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:13,501
And his environment.

403
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:16,751
At such high dependence,
a person loses comprehension.

404
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:18,918
He is my younger brother.

405
00:32:18,918 --> 00:32:20,876
Dad left me to raise him.

406
00:32:23,418 --> 00:32:25,376
After he's discharged,
bring him to my clinic.

407
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:28,793
Maqbool road,
opposite Rajju's mansion.

408
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:30,585
We'll do our best.

409
00:32:31,543 --> 00:32:32,835
Okay?

410
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:50,126
Hello.

411
00:32:50,418 --> 00:32:52,460
Stuff... Do you want stuff?

412
00:32:56,543 --> 00:32:58,876
Wrong number.
- Three kilos of heroin.

413
00:32:59,126 --> 00:33:01,210
I will not call again.

414
00:33:05,793 --> 00:33:06,960
How much?

415
00:33:08,376 --> 00:33:09,835
Three thousand.

416
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:12,126
Write down the address.

417
00:33:16,376 --> 00:33:17,626
Just a second.

418
00:33:28,543 --> 00:33:29,626
Birdbrain!

419
00:33:29,793 --> 00:33:36,251
One, ten, hundred, thousand...

420
00:33:36,418 --> 00:33:38,751
ten thousand!

421
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:56,501
Is anyone there?

422
00:33:57,168 --> 00:34:02,085
Please let me talk to Mr. Brar.

423
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:04,793
Maninder Brar, MP

424
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:08,210
I performed at his daughter's wedding.

425
00:34:08,501 --> 00:34:10,376
I am Tommy Singh.

426
00:34:10,376 --> 00:34:12,835
Let me talk to him.

427
00:34:16,001 --> 00:34:17,960
Let me talk to him.

428
00:34:27,626 --> 00:34:29,710
At least give me water.

429
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:34,710
I should at least get water,
sister fuckers!

430
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:37,876
This is wrong, sister fuckers!

431
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:40,293
It's 'human rights', sister fuckers!

432
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:43,376
Give me water right now!

433
00:34:43,376 --> 00:34:46,585
Give me water!

434
00:34:52,793 --> 00:34:54,210
What happened?

435
00:34:54,501 --> 00:34:56,418
<i>You want to go home'?</i>

436
00:34:56,418 --> 00:34:57,501
Go then.

437
00:34:57,876 --> 00:35:00,085
The bail can happen later, sir.

438
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:03,335
You're a celebrity, after all. VIP!

439
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,626
Kartar, take out the jeep.

440
00:35:07,418 --> 00:35:09,501
We have to drop sir back home.

441
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:12,835
This way, sir.

442
00:35:15,793 --> 00:35:19,626
Sister fucker, so you are the GABRU?

443
00:35:20,793 --> 00:35:23,126
Sister fucker,
you're spoiling the youth.

444
00:35:23,126 --> 00:35:24,626
You fucker!

445
00:35:24,793 --> 00:35:26,251
You are the GABRU, right?

446
00:35:34,793 --> 00:35:37,751
Become a man first, then a VIP.

447
00:35:37,918 --> 00:35:39,585
Loser!

448
00:36:16,126 --> 00:36:24,001
<i>Ambarsar is high, Jalandhar,
Ludhiana and Moga, every burb.</i>

449
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:27,501
<i>You try it too, brother,
Don't fear, don't curb.</i>

450
00:36:27,793 --> 00:36:35,085
<i>Daddy is high, brother is high,
Uncles are digging it on the sly,</i>

451
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:39,501
<i>Strong and the weak snort it alike
Let the white power strike.</i>

452
00:36:40,376 --> 00:36:42,293
We were in the 8th grade

453
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:44,501
when your first song released.

454
00:36:45,168 --> 00:36:47,210
We are your fans since.

455
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:49,876
We want to be like you.

456
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:51,710
The GABRU!

457
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,751
The first time I injected myself,

458
00:36:54,918 --> 00:36:58,001
I swear,
all I could see was your face!

459
00:37:00,376 --> 00:37:04,376
Mother fuckers!
You've killed your mother.

460
00:37:04,376 --> 00:37:06,376
And now you sing songs here?

461
00:37:06,543 --> 00:37:08,335
Aren't you ashamed!

462
00:37:11,501 --> 00:37:13,460
She was not giving us money.

463
00:37:13,793 --> 00:37:17,126
We needed to have our fix.
What else could we do.

464
00:38:01,543 --> 00:38:06,501
<i>Tales of a lonely night,</i>

465
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:10,751
<i>Lone in a daze,
Nobody in sight</i>

466
00:38:11,126 --> 00:38:15,835
<i>Don't turn back to look
Don't turn back to look</i>

467
00:38:16,251 --> 00:38:18,876
<i>Faces lurking around the brook.</i>

468
00:38:19,251 --> 00:38:22,210
<i>Fear stings like a venomous snake</i>

469
00:38:24,043 --> 00:38:27,585
<i>Distant dreams grin at my fate.</i>

470
00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:35,001
<i>Look what just crept up from behind</i>

471
00:38:35,418 --> 00:38:38,960
<i>Fear of the unknown
Turning me blind.</i>

472
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:44,835
<i>Keep an eye,
Tread with caution</i>

473
00:38:45,043 --> 00:38:47,626
<i>Eerie faces, beaming so often.</i>

474
00:38:48,043 --> 00:38:52,626
<i>Fear stings like a venomous snake</i>

475
00:38:52,793 --> 00:38:56,085
<i>Distant dreams grin at my fate.</i>

476
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:02,251
<i>Fear stings like a venomous snake</i>

477
00:39:02,418 --> 00:39:05,751
<i>Distant dreams grin at my fate.</i>

478
00:39:08,418 --> 00:39:11,043
<i>The world is shrinking into a dot</i>

479
00:39:11,043 --> 00:39:13,376
<i>I can't breathe,
I'm left to rot.</i>

480
00:39:13,543 --> 00:39:15,918
<i>Draw me a few lines,
I beg of you.</i>

481
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:18,001
<i>Let me snort happiness,
I beg of you.</i>

482
00:39:18,293 --> 00:39:20,626
<i>Alcohol fades in
comparison to its high.</i>

483
00:39:20,626 --> 00:39:23,043
<i>I see god in my veins
When I shoot up and fly.</i>

484
00:39:23,043 --> 00:39:27,793
<i>My veins throbbing with desire
Just one inhale, and I'll retire</i>

485
00:39:27,793 --> 00:39:30,085
<i>I feel empty, I feel lonely.</i>

486
00:39:30,293 --> 00:39:32,376
<i>I am agitated, I can't go on.</i>

487
00:39:32,751 --> 00:39:34,751
<i>My body is trembling,
My soul on fire</i>

488
00:39:35,043 --> 00:39:37,085
<i>Death is crooning,
Feels like my pyre</i>

489
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:39,710
<i>My gullet is dry as a bone</i>

490
00:39:39,876 --> 00:39:42,251
<i>Life is leaving me
One breath at a time.</i>

491
00:39:42,251 --> 00:39:44,585
<i>When will this misery end
When will I end?</i>

492
00:39:44,793 --> 00:39:47,376
<i>I run and hide
From nobody but myself.</i>

493
00:39:47,376 --> 00:39:48,501
I think she is the same girl...

494
00:39:48,501 --> 00:39:49,585
Faster!

495
00:40:02,543 --> 00:40:04,876
Bro, why is she running
into the fields?

496
00:41:04,918 --> 00:41:07,626
Kuku, stop her, sister fucker!
What is she doing?

497
00:41:07,626 --> 00:41:09,626
Yes, sir.
- Run... run!

498
00:41:09,626 --> 00:41:13,751
Ruining our stuff, bitch!

499
00:41:28,293 --> 00:41:31,001
Here you go, Jackie Chan.

500
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:52,126
Greetings.

501
00:41:52,126 --> 00:41:53,585
Greetings to you too.

502
00:41:54,043 --> 00:41:56,001
Will you have some buttermilk?

503
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:10,585
Greetings.

504
00:42:11,293 --> 00:42:12,460
Bhandi at your service, sir!

505
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:15,376
Look at me!

506
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:18,501
She is from Bihar.

507
00:42:18,918 --> 00:42:21,251
A labourer in Karnail Singh's farm.

508
00:42:22,043 --> 00:42:25,710
Such meticulous planning, the bitch!

509
00:42:27,043 --> 00:42:30,126
That explains the
fucking missing delivery.

510
00:42:32,793 --> 00:42:35,876
Sister fucker!

511
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:47,710
Let Jackie Chan have him.

512
00:42:47,918 --> 00:42:48,960
Let's go, sister fucker!

513
00:42:53,043 --> 00:42:56,001
Listen... don't kill him.

514
00:42:57,126 --> 00:42:58,876
He is family.

515
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,876
Take him to the fields.

516
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,751
Sir, what to do with her?

517
00:43:11,168 --> 00:43:14,001
She isn't family, right?

518
00:43:24,418 --> 00:43:28,251
Child, the stuff was worth 10 million.

519
00:43:30,418 --> 00:43:34,126
If you wanted to throw it,

520
00:43:34,293 --> 00:43:37,126
then why did you steal it?

521
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:32,876
Let me go.

522
00:44:32,876 --> 00:44:33,918
Just for a little while.

523
00:44:33,918 --> 00:44:35,001
It won't take long.

524
00:44:46,001 --> 00:44:48,126
Leave me!
- Bitch

525
00:44:53,293 --> 00:44:56,876
Leave me.
- Listen to me.

526
00:45:05,543 --> 00:45:09,251
Leave me. Let me go.

527
00:45:24,126 --> 00:45:25,960
Come.
- Calm down.

528
00:45:26,168 --> 00:45:28,751
Now grab me.

529
00:45:35,501 --> 00:45:37,085
Grab her.

530
00:45:38,668 --> 00:45:39,876
Leave me.

531
00:45:40,376 --> 00:45:44,126
I'll teach her a lesson.
Hold her down.

532
00:45:45,501 --> 00:45:47,585
Leave me, motherfuckers!

533
00:46:07,543 --> 00:46:09,876
"After a whole week..."

534
00:46:10,043 --> 00:46:13,376
"Tommy Singh was finally
released from prison today."

535
00:46:13,543 --> 00:46:17,001
"While agreeing to his bail,
the court has specified..."

536
00:46:17,168 --> 00:46:21,793
"that his celebrity status
shouldn't warrant any leniency."

537
00:46:21,793 --> 00:46:23,335
Move aside.

538
00:46:25,918 --> 00:46:28,251
- Tommy, who is the GABRU?

539
00:46:28,251 --> 00:46:30,251
- Where has the GABRU gone?
- Where has Tommy, the GABRU gone?

540
00:46:30,918 --> 00:46:33,960
At least let me get inside. Move.

541
00:46:45,168 --> 00:46:46,751
A single person takes to drugs.

542
00:46:48,918 --> 00:46:52,126
But, it affects the entire family.

543
00:46:53,251 --> 00:46:55,501
Initially,
drugs are taken for pleasure.

544
00:46:56,126 --> 00:47:00,376
Later, drugs become their life goal.
- Open the door, I beg you!

545
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:04,835
Love, friends, family,
career, education...

546
00:47:05,168 --> 00:47:05,835
Nothing remains!

547
00:47:06,043 --> 00:47:09,626
What do I do with you?

548
00:47:10,043 --> 00:47:11,126
Leave him, Sartaj.

549
00:47:11,293 --> 00:47:13,043
Let him go, son. Let him go.

550
00:47:13,043 --> 00:47:14,335
Leave him.

551
00:47:15,793 --> 00:47:17,251
I'm away from home all day.

552
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:19,001
How do I know what's happening here?

553
00:47:19,168 --> 00:47:21,376
You all should've
taken care of him.

554
00:47:28,043 --> 00:47:30,085
Everything that is
beautiful within the person,

555
00:47:31,668 --> 00:47:37,876
his adorations in life,
drugs finishes off everything.

556
00:47:39,918 --> 00:47:41,876
I am not reciting hearsay.

557
00:47:45,918 --> 00:47:47,001
I have seen it with my own eyes.

558
00:47:53,418 --> 00:47:54,751
Sign here.

559
00:48:00,293 --> 00:48:02,418
Mother, I want to go home.

560
00:48:02,418 --> 00:48:04,168
Don't worry, son.

561
00:48:04,168 --> 00:48:05,626
Just a little longer.

562
00:48:06,501 --> 00:48:08,668
Shyam, take him to the ward.

563
00:48:08,668 --> 00:48:10,251
Go with them, kiddo.

564
00:48:11,668 --> 00:48:12,751
- Thank you, Doctor.

565
00:48:13,751 --> 00:48:14,876
Let's go, my dear.

566
00:48:15,376 --> 00:48:16,876
Thank you, Madam.

567
00:48:16,876 --> 00:48:19,126
Now it's all up to you. Thank you.

568
00:48:21,918 --> 00:48:23,710
Wait a moment.
- Yes?

569
00:48:34,168 --> 00:48:37,835
Next time, don't come here
in your uniform.

570
00:48:38,751 --> 00:48:39,751
Why?

571
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:41,376
What were you saying the other day?

572
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:44,751
You weren't aware of what was
happening with your brother?

573
00:48:45,001 --> 00:48:47,668
Have any idea what's
happening in Jashanpura?

574
00:48:47,668 --> 00:48:50,501
In Amritsar? In Tarn Taran?
In all of Punjab?

575
00:48:51,251 --> 00:48:52,876
Do you have any idea?

576
00:48:53,251 --> 00:48:54,793
You're an Assistant Inspector, right?

577
00:48:54,793 --> 00:48:55,835
Which department?

578
00:48:56,668 --> 00:48:58,126
What is the matter, madam?

579
00:48:58,126 --> 00:48:59,751
Why are you talking to me like this?

580
00:49:00,001 --> 00:49:02,751
What's your 'cut'
for not having an idea?

581
00:49:03,751 --> 00:49:06,126
Ten thousand a week, isn't it?

582
00:49:06,126 --> 00:49:08,001
Then why have you got him here?

583
00:49:08,001 --> 00:49:10,376
Take him to a private clinic in Delhi.

584
00:49:10,376 --> 00:49:11,543
What is it, Madam?

585
00:49:11,543 --> 00:49:13,001
Because I am silent...

586
00:49:13,001 --> 00:49:14,501
What will you say?

587
00:49:14,876 --> 00:49:17,126
It doesn't bother you
to ruin a generation.

588
00:49:17,293 --> 00:49:18,918
But when it <i>comes</i> to
your brother, it hurts?

589
00:49:18,918 --> 00:49:20,085
Madam...

590
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,251
This is what he's addicted to.

591
00:49:25,043 --> 00:49:27,751
A combination of Pheniramine
and buprenorphine.

592
00:49:28,668 --> 00:49:31,085
You must've seen
this bottle somewhere.

593
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:33,710
Or do you have no idea about this too?

594
00:49:37,126 --> 00:49:39,418
They are two separate drugs...

595
00:49:39,418 --> 00:49:42,001
that should only be
sold with prescription.

596
00:49:42,168 --> 00:49:46,126
But thanks to you, the producers are
combining these drugs...

597
00:49:46,126 --> 00:49:48,668
and sellers are openly selling them

598
00:49:48,668 --> 00:49:51,376
by the name of 'Chaand',
in every chemist shop.

599
00:49:51,376 --> 00:49:53,210
For a mere 50 rupees.

600
00:49:53,501 --> 00:49:55,835
The price of your brother's life!

601
00:50:01,918 --> 00:50:02,960
It's my turn tonight.

602
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:05,876
Let them go, baby.

603
00:50:06,751 --> 00:50:07,751
Let them go.

604
00:50:13,126 --> 00:50:13,960
All good?

605
00:50:15,001 --> 00:50:17,335
Do you want to do her?

606
00:50:20,293 --> 00:50:21,251
She looks good.

607
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:22,501
Let go.

608
00:50:22,751 --> 00:50:24,876
I need to buy a phone, sir.
- Buy it next time.

609
00:50:26,876 --> 00:50:27,960
Will you buy it for me?

610
00:50:31,043 --> 00:50:33,751
Sir, what are you doing?

611
00:50:33,918 --> 00:50:36,126
He's a regular on this route.

612
00:50:36,126 --> 00:50:38,960
Sir, leave him, he'll die.

613
00:50:39,668 --> 00:50:42,626
Leave him.
- What happened?

614
00:50:51,793 --> 00:50:53,126
Let it go.

615
00:50:55,001 --> 00:50:56,668
Are you out of your mind?

616
00:50:56,668 --> 00:50:59,835
It is Pehelwan's truck, sister fucker!
Get him water.

617
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:05,418
It happens. He just lost it.

618
00:51:05,418 --> 00:51:07,835
Hey, get him bandaged.

619
00:51:08,168 --> 00:51:12,376
Here, take this, go on.

620
00:51:12,918 --> 00:51:15,210
You leave the truck at Pehelwan's.

621
00:51:15,918 --> 00:51:16,501
Okay, sir.

622
00:51:16,918 --> 00:51:17,710
Don't mention anything to anyone.

623
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:19,126
Hurry up.

624
00:51:22,043 --> 00:51:23,501
There is a system.

625
00:51:23,668 --> 00:51:25,710
And everyone has to follow it.

626
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:29,501
I can handle him being beaten up.

627
00:51:30,251 --> 00:51:33,210
But how can you damage his truck?

628
00:51:35,543 --> 00:51:37,335
It is Pehelwan's truck!

629
00:51:39,126 --> 00:51:41,001
Pehelwan is a Member of Parliament.

630
00:51:41,543 --> 00:51:44,085
Yet he pays our cut. Doesn't he?

631
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,251
He can have both of us suspended.

632
00:51:46,418 --> 00:51:48,085
Brother, I want to go home.

633
00:51:48,293 --> 00:51:50,001
Go home.

634
00:51:50,751 --> 00:51:52,335
Take care of Balli.

635
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:53,626
Go.

636
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,376
Whatsapp me if there is a problem.

637
00:52:49,543 --> 00:52:52,876
- Make it quick. There's a lot to finish.

638
00:52:54,626 --> 00:52:55,876
- No Issues.

639
00:52:56,126 --> 00:52:58,501
- Everything is in control.

640
00:52:59,293 --> 00:53:00,626
- No, no. It's okay.

641
00:53:01,043 --> 00:53:02,501
- Hey, boss is here.

642
00:53:14,043 --> 00:53:15,751
- Come. Have some tea.

643
00:53:29,626 --> 00:53:33,876
[Vote for Rajveer Singh!
Vote for barbell!]

644
00:53:47,626 --> 00:53:52,376
<i>You are not my mother</i>

645
00:53:53,168 --> 00:53:59,876
<i>But an enemy.</i>

646
00:54:04,293 --> 00:54:13,126
<i>You've sent me to exile too soon.</i>

647
00:54:38,293 --> 00:54:39,835
Hello, baby.

648
00:54:46,043 --> 00:54:47,501
Baby...

649
00:54:48,168 --> 00:54:49,626
Look here!

650
00:54:51,543 --> 00:54:52,960
Look here!

651
00:54:53,793 --> 00:54:55,251
Smile please...

652
00:55:00,876 --> 00:55:02,626
It's nice.

653
00:55:03,918 --> 00:55:05,626
You look pretty.

654
00:55:17,501 --> 00:55:19,751
Tell me if you need anything.

655
00:55:21,043 --> 00:55:22,585
Anything for you.

656
00:55:41,751 --> 00:55:44,001
We've spoilt you.

657
00:56:28,668 --> 00:56:30,043
She is quite petite.

658
00:56:30,043 --> 00:56:31,585
She looked okay on the phone.

659
00:56:33,251 --> 00:56:34,126
New phone?

660
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:37,751
Yes, sir. I bought it for 8000 rupees.

661
00:56:38,793 --> 00:56:41,876
Eight thousand! You aren't worth it.

662
00:56:43,543 --> 00:56:45,585
New phone!

663
00:56:55,293 --> 00:56:56,501
She won't bite, right?

664
00:56:57,251 --> 00:57:00,126
No, sir. She's well trained now.

665
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:37,460
Hey, Tommy. My darling child!

666
00:58:38,168 --> 00:58:39,376
Do one thing...

667
00:58:39,668 --> 00:58:42,210
Just make one hit number!

668
00:58:42,668 --> 00:58:44,876
Just one monster hit song!

669
00:58:45,293 --> 00:58:48,501
And then there is that
anti-drug concert.

670
00:58:48,668 --> 00:58:51,960
It's the best step for our image.

671
00:58:52,501 --> 00:58:54,751
Will help the case too.

672
00:58:55,501 --> 00:59:00,876
Public will know that our Tommy
is no more into drugs.

673
00:59:01,418 --> 00:59:02,460
He's clean now.

674
00:59:33,418 --> 00:59:37,751
Told you it's not happening.

675
00:59:38,293 --> 00:59:39,251
Told you!

676
00:59:51,001 --> 00:59:52,626
Uncle...

677
00:59:54,043 --> 00:59:57,460
I think our bro here
can probably do with some inspiration.

678
01:00:04,376 --> 01:00:05,960
Sister fuckers!

679
01:00:07,418 --> 01:00:12,501
Your 'inspiration'
sent my boy to jail.

680
01:00:12,501 --> 01:00:14,876
Now, if you even mention it...
- I am sorry, uncle.

681
01:00:22,876 --> 01:00:24,501
I want to go to London.

682
01:00:27,918 --> 01:00:29,876
I want to go to London!

683
01:00:31,543 --> 01:00:32,960
I have to go to London.

684
01:00:34,126 --> 01:00:34,960
You shut up!

685
01:00:36,168 --> 01:00:37,335
Killed your mother!

686
01:00:38,043 --> 01:00:41,501
I want to go to London!

687
01:00:43,001 --> 01:00:44,835
Going to London, fuckers!

688
01:00:45,751 --> 01:00:48,001
Open the door, Monty.

689
01:00:48,001 --> 01:00:50,835
I say open the door.
- Please, sir.

690
01:00:51,668 --> 01:00:55,501
Please, sir. Stop.

691
01:00:55,501 --> 01:00:58,376
Please don't.
- I'll shoot!

692
01:00:58,376 --> 01:01:01,251
No... no!
- Move away.

693
01:01:01,251 --> 01:01:03,251
Bro, what are you doing?
- Get out of my way.

694
01:01:03,251 --> 01:01:05,376
<i>I'll</i> shoot.
- No... no!

695
01:01:05,668 --> 01:01:07,543
Son...

696
01:01:07,543 --> 01:01:11,751
Son, the court will decide
if you can go or not.

697
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:14,543
You only do your concert.

698
01:01:14,543 --> 01:01:16,668
I don't want to do the concert.
I want to go.

699
01:01:16,668 --> 01:01:18,793
Please let me go, uncle.

700
01:01:18,793 --> 01:01:20,126
Sister fucker!

701
01:01:20,668 --> 01:01:23,460
You'll shoot me? Me?

702
01:01:24,001 --> 01:01:26,126
I made you a star.

703
01:01:26,543 --> 01:01:30,626
Your father had abandoned you, sister fucker!.
- I want to go, uncle.

704
01:01:30,626 --> 01:01:34,918
I got your younger sister married, fucker!
- I want to go...

705
01:01:34,918 --> 01:01:38,376
And you'll shoot me? Shoot me!

706
01:01:38,668 --> 01:01:39,501
Let me go.

707
01:01:39,501 --> 01:01:40,751
Shoot... shoot!

708
01:01:54,751 --> 01:01:56,960
- Call your mom in the morning.

709
01:02:04,626 --> 01:02:06,460
Get up Kiddo.

710
01:02:07,501 --> 01:02:10,085
Get up, child. Easy!
- No!

711
01:02:10,918 --> 01:02:12,001
Have the medicine.

712
01:02:12,001 --> 01:02:14,960
Have. You'll feel better.
- I won't!

713
01:02:15,418 --> 01:02:16,251
It isn't bitter.

714
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:17,626
Very good!

715
01:02:56,793 --> 01:02:59,210
They're luring voters with drugs this
election, not alcohol or blankets.

716
01:02:59,668 --> 01:03:01,126
Trucks are loaded with this stuff.

717
01:03:01,293 --> 01:03:04,626
Godowns are getting filled.
It's a well organized operation.

718
01:03:04,918 --> 01:03:07,335
Party workers will be
distributing them in every village.

719
01:03:07,918 --> 01:03:11,126
I will drag Pehelwan
by his balls to jail.

720
01:03:11,918 --> 01:03:14,876
I will either lose
my job or I will get shot.

721
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,335
You decide if you want to
take it to the media.

722
01:03:20,293 --> 01:03:23,251
It may get difficult to
hush the matter later.

723
01:03:24,043 --> 01:03:26,876
Might get your name
on all the front pages too!

724
01:03:31,668 --> 01:03:33,001
Fighting from within the system...

725
01:03:33,293 --> 01:03:35,876
and shouting slogans
from the sidelines...

726
01:03:35,876 --> 01:03:37,710
You'll realise the difference
with this case, madam.

727
01:03:45,793 --> 01:03:48,376
Hey listen... hello!

728
01:03:49,043 --> 01:03:51,751
What's the point in arresting
Pehelwan alone?

729
01:03:51,918 --> 01:03:52,960
What?

730
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:56,293
There is a Pehelwan sitting
in every district.

731
01:03:56,293 --> 01:03:57,168
So?

732
01:03:57,168 --> 01:03:59,501
Pehelwan is just a dealer
of these drugs.

733
01:03:59,501 --> 01:04:02,251
The manufacturers are
the ones to be arrested.

734
01:04:02,251 --> 01:04:04,001
Find out about their factory.
Raid them.

735
01:04:04,001 --> 01:04:06,126
Madam, have you seen my uniform?

736
01:04:06,293 --> 01:04:08,043
How many stars do I have?

737
01:04:08,043 --> 01:04:09,043
One star.

738
01:04:09,043 --> 01:04:10,501
What does one star mean?

739
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:13,001
D.l.G.? Commissioner?

740
01:04:13,001 --> 01:04:14,751
I am only an Assistant.

741
01:04:14,751 --> 01:04:17,626
You said that this stuff is being
made to lure voters.

742
01:04:17,793 --> 01:04:19,668
So there must be
a political connection.

743
01:04:19,668 --> 01:04:22,001
There is no political connection.
This is politics!

744
01:04:22,001 --> 01:04:24,293
The sermons that you give
on TV about narco politics.

745
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:25,043
This is it.

746
01:04:25,043 --> 01:04:26,626
So many MPs are dealers themselves.

747
01:04:26,626 --> 01:04:30,876
We can shout from the rooftops,
no one will listen to us.

748
01:04:33,668 --> 01:04:35,376
Election Commission.

749
01:04:36,793 --> 01:04:39,043
Elections will take place in a month.

750
01:04:39,043 --> 01:04:41,751
Right now, the Commission
is powerful in the state.

751
01:04:42,168 --> 01:04:44,126
Add media pressure to that,

752
01:04:44,293 --> 01:04:46,335
they'll be forced to take action.

753
01:04:46,626 --> 01:04:49,626
But everything has to be
done before the elections.

754
01:05:02,293 --> 01:05:04,418
I am sorry about yesterday.

755
01:05:04,418 --> 01:05:06,335
Hang on.
I just want to talk to you.

756
01:05:09,751 --> 01:05:12,126
Sir, I am just a driver.

757
01:05:12,418 --> 01:05:13,501
From the factory to the godown,

758
01:05:13,501 --> 01:05:15,043
and godown to the factory.

759
01:05:15,043 --> 01:05:16,751
I don't know about these games.

760
01:05:17,793 --> 01:05:19,585
Your factory is in Barotiwala

761
01:05:20,168 --> 01:05:21,960
near the Himachal border, isn't it?

762
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:23,793
Come, let's take a ride.

763
01:05:23,793 --> 01:05:26,751
No, sir. I will lose my job.

764
01:05:26,918 --> 01:05:30,626
I came from my village
just to earn a living.

765
01:05:40,543 --> 01:05:42,043
I have to arrange for
my sister's wedding, too.

766
01:05:42,043 --> 01:05:43,751
<i>Fuck off!</i>

767
01:05:53,418 --> 01:05:55,376
I've been snooping around
the factory for four days, madam.

768
01:05:56,418 --> 01:05:58,126
Inside out.

769
01:05:58,418 --> 01:05:59,626
Took lot of pics too.

770
01:06:01,668 --> 01:06:03,501
From outside, the factory appears
to be shut for long.

771
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:05,126
Just some guards outside.

772
01:06:06,793 --> 01:06:08,376
Work happens in the morning shift.

773
01:06:09,501 --> 01:06:11,501
9 AM through 7 PM.

774
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:12,626
Covertly.

775
01:06:16,293 --> 01:06:18,251
I searched everywhere but
I found nothing.

776
01:06:18,793 --> 01:06:20,251
Looked into the workshop, too.

777
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,876
Inspected the machines.

778
01:06:23,793 --> 01:06:25,501
I saw some oil bottles there

779
01:06:25,918 --> 01:06:27,585
but no names on them.

780
01:06:30,751 --> 01:06:32,710
No factory signboard either.

781
01:06:34,876 --> 01:06:37,251
We won't get information
about the owners from here.

782
01:06:51,168 --> 01:06:55,126
These are the chemicals used
to make this drug.

783
01:06:55,376 --> 01:06:58,501
Ethanol, Hydrochloric Acid, Methyl,
Paraben, Maleic Acid, Opium.

784
01:07:00,001 --> 01:07:01,251
They aren't easy to procure.

785
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:03,960
Some are imported...
and some are controlled.

786
01:07:04,293 --> 01:07:05,335
Like Opium.

787
01:07:06,043 --> 01:07:08,710
Only two places in India where
opium is legally manufactured...

788
01:07:09,293 --> 01:07:11,126
Neemuch and Ghazipur.

789
01:07:11,918 --> 01:07:14,376
Detailed paper work is required
to source opium from there...

790
01:07:14,918 --> 01:07:15,876
with thorough inspection.

791
01:07:16,543 --> 01:07:18,626
Any random company
can't procure from there.

792
01:07:19,501 --> 01:07:22,501
It is issued to licensed
pharmaceutical companies only.

793
01:07:25,793 --> 01:07:28,376
Now, if they are procuring such large
amounts of opium...

794
01:07:28,751 --> 01:07:35,960
it means either a pharma company or
its employee is supplying them illegally.

795
01:07:36,543 --> 01:07:40,876
And they are doing all the paper
work behind a bogus company.

796
01:07:41,376 --> 01:07:44,751
If we find out the name of
this company and its owner

797
01:07:45,251 --> 01:07:48,001
we'll understand the entire
political nexus, Sartaj.

798
01:07:48,168 --> 01:07:50,126
That's it. Their game will be over.

799
01:07:50,918 --> 01:07:52,501
I'm slow in these matters.

800
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:54,710
I barely made it past college.

801
01:07:55,668 --> 01:07:57,501
I've been at it since four days.

802
01:07:57,501 --> 01:08:00,001
Whatever I could find, I have.

803
01:08:00,501 --> 01:08:01,876
You can take someone's help.

804
01:08:01,876 --> 01:08:03,126
Whose help can I take?

805
01:08:03,293 --> 01:08:06,126
If anyone in the
department finds out...

806
01:08:07,168 --> 01:08:10,960
Think, Sartaj. Think of something.

807
01:08:11,793 --> 01:08:13,251
Are you bloody mad?

808
01:08:13,626 --> 01:08:16,001
Only you know this chemical business.

809
01:08:16,168 --> 01:08:18,376
Are you out of your mind? No way!

810
01:08:18,668 --> 01:08:20,251
We will go after the shift is over.

811
01:08:20,251 --> 01:08:21,960
Except for two watchmen,
nobody is going to be there.

812
01:08:22,376 --> 01:08:23,251
We don't have to go today.

813
01:08:23,543 --> 01:08:24,626
Maybe after a couple of days.

814
01:08:25,001 --> 01:08:26,460
This is not my job, Sartaj.

815
01:08:27,626 --> 01:08:30,376
I am a doctor. A lady at that.

816
01:08:31,501 --> 01:08:34,168
All the men in Punjab
are drugged out, madam.

817
01:08:34,168 --> 01:08:36,626
Now it's up to the ladies.

818
01:08:37,918 --> 01:08:40,001
You have saved Balli's life.

819
01:08:40,001 --> 01:08:42,001
I won't let anything happen to you.

820
01:08:44,543 --> 01:08:46,710
Careful!

821
01:08:47,918 --> 01:08:52,001
Where is Tommy's Diet Coke?

822
01:08:52,001 --> 01:08:53,001
I had the Diet Coke kept.

823
01:08:53,001 --> 01:08:55,251
Where is the Diet Coke?
- Where is the Diet Coke, sister f****r!?

824
01:08:56,168 --> 01:08:57,376
Get the Diet Coke.

825
01:08:57,543 --> 01:08:59,460
This should have been put first.

826
01:09:00,001 --> 01:09:01,376
Careful.

827
01:09:01,376 --> 01:09:02,751
Get it fast.

828
01:09:06,001 --> 01:09:07,835
Son, it happens.

829
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:10,501
It was cocaine's withdrawal symptom

830
01:09:10,668 --> 01:09:11,876
Love you...

831
01:09:12,376 --> 01:09:15,126
Hug <i>me</i> as well, daddy.

832
01:11:21,293 --> 01:11:23,251
How are you?
- All okay?

833
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:24,751
Do you want a dose?
- No.

834
01:11:24,918 --> 01:11:27,043
Our man's shooting up at the back.
Go join.

835
01:11:27,043 --> 01:11:28,626
I have a bad stomach.

836
01:11:28,793 --> 01:11:30,626
Okay then.

837
01:11:30,876 --> 01:11:33,293
They've put us on a double shift.

838
01:11:33,293 --> 01:11:35,043
They think we are dogs.

839
01:11:35,043 --> 01:11:36,001
Why don't you say something?

840
01:11:36,168 --> 01:11:39,751
There's no point to it.
Who cares about us?

841
01:11:43,501 --> 01:11:47,960
Tommy! Tommy!

842
01:11:51,293 --> 01:11:54,376
Move aside.

843
01:13:28,418 --> 01:13:34,751
There was an election rally at Jashanpura,
organized by Maninder Brar...

844
01:13:35,001 --> 01:13:38,001
He addressed over thousand people...

845
01:13:38,168 --> 01:13:44,251
He raised the issue of
drugs ruining the youth...

846
01:13:44,418 --> 01:13:48,460
He appealed to the people,
asking their support in this issue.

847
01:13:48,793 --> 01:13:52,001
I want to tell the youth of Punjab...

848
01:13:52,293 --> 01:13:55,876
that this whole fight,

849
01:13:56,293 --> 01:13:58,210
this war on drugs,

850
01:13:58,793 --> 01:14:01,876
is above all, an individual war.

851
01:14:03,918 --> 01:14:06,001
We're with you in this war.

852
01:14:06,626 --> 01:14:08,210
We are here to support you.

853
01:14:08,918 --> 01:14:11,376
I appeal to the the youth of Punjab,

854
01:14:11,668 --> 01:14:14,210
to fight it back!

855
01:14:14,418 --> 01:14:16,168
My dear young ones, march on!

856
01:14:16,168 --> 01:14:17,251
We are with you.

857
01:14:17,543 --> 01:14:19,001
My dear young ones, march on!

858
01:14:19,918 --> 01:14:21,001
We are with you.

859
01:14:32,543 --> 01:14:34,835
Hey, Kaka, Lucky, Sonu!

860
01:14:35,043 --> 01:14:37,460
Get up all of you!
She's running away.

861
01:15:45,376 --> 01:15:46,335
Found anything?

862
01:15:51,001 --> 01:15:51,835
Look at this.

863
01:15:52,876 --> 01:15:54,501
They want to ruin all of Punjab.

864
01:15:57,418 --> 01:15:58,501
What are they on to?

865
01:16:04,543 --> 01:16:06,376
There is nothing here, Sartaj.

866
01:16:09,751 --> 01:16:10,751
Let's look over there.

867
01:16:24,918 --> 01:16:26,376
Come on. Let's get going.

868
01:16:26,918 --> 01:16:28,626
Wasn't it a day off today?

869
01:16:32,876 --> 01:16:35,126
- Sir, the Ghazipur goods are here.

870
01:16:36,793 --> 01:16:39,960
Sartaj, I think this
is the consignment

871
01:16:40,293 --> 01:16:42,335
This is what we were looking for.

872
01:16:42,793 --> 01:16:44,460
Do you have a safety pin?

873
01:16:47,501 --> 01:16:49,751
Come out as soon as I call you. Okay?

874
01:16:50,001 --> 01:16:50,710
<i>Okay.</i>

875
01:16:50,918 --> 01:16:53,251
Don't worry. I am here.

876
01:17:04,918 --> 01:17:07,085
- Be careful.

877
01:17:09,793 --> 01:17:12,126
- Watch it, it's heavy.

878
01:17:17,126 --> 01:17:17,918
- Keep it here.

879
01:17:17,918 --> 01:17:19,335
- Hurry.

880
01:17:20,668 --> 01:17:22,501
- Get that here.

881
01:17:23,668 --> 01:17:25,335
- Faster.

882
01:17:30,418 --> 01:17:32,001
- Move it.

883
01:17:33,918 --> 01:17:35,668
- <i>Easy...'</i>

884
01:17:35,668 --> 01:17:37,376
- I got it...

885
01:17:37,376 --> 01:17:38,876
[Opium and Alkaloids]

886
01:17:38,876 --> 01:17:40,376
- Move it.

887
01:17:49,668 --> 01:17:52,876
Good job.
Brother, please take over.

888
01:17:53,626 --> 01:17:54,626
What happened?

889
01:18:03,043 --> 01:18:04,710
What's with the power?

890
01:18:05,001 --> 01:18:06,626
I think the power has gone out.

891
01:18:06,793 --> 01:18:07,626
Even I know that.

892
01:18:07,793 --> 01:18:09,043
The power has not gone.

893
01:18:09,043 --> 01:18:10,251
There are lights outside.

894
01:18:10,251 --> 01:18:11,418
Only our factory is blacked out.

895
01:18:11,418 --> 01:18:13,251
I think the fuse must have blown.

896
01:18:13,418 --> 01:18:14,793
Why are you standing here
and talking about it?

897
01:18:14,793 --> 01:18:15,793
Do something.

898
01:18:15,793 --> 01:18:16,626
Come on.
- Come.

899
01:18:16,793 --> 01:18:18,001
Check if there's a lose connection.

900
01:18:18,168 --> 01:18:20,251
Turn the damn generator on!

901
01:18:20,793 --> 01:18:22,543
Just find some help.

902
01:18:22,543 --> 01:18:24,126
Everything is okay here...

903
01:18:24,126 --> 01:18:25,668
Did you find anything?

904
01:18:25,668 --> 01:18:27,001
No. Everything is okay here.

905
01:18:27,668 --> 01:18:29,460
Turn the damn generator on!

906
01:18:38,168 --> 01:18:40,460
This damn power cut!

907
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:45,126
Thank God, the power's back on.

908
01:18:45,126 --> 01:18:47,960
Everybody back to work.

909
01:18:48,626 --> 01:18:49,251
What was the problem?

910
01:18:49,418 --> 01:18:51,251
The fuse was down.

911
01:19:47,126 --> 01:19:48,126
Come on hurry up.

912
01:19:50,043 --> 01:19:50,835
Come on.

913
01:19:51,918 --> 01:19:52,876
Sartaj...

914
01:19:53,168 --> 01:19:55,001
Sartaj, come on.

915
01:19:57,043 --> 01:19:58,085
<i>Leave it. I'll ride.</i>

916
01:20:00,293 --> 01:20:01,085
Sit tight.

917
01:20:36,043 --> 01:20:41,585
Stop!

918
01:21:09,126 --> 01:21:12,501
Tommy, try the blonde look.

919
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:14,251
It will suit you.

920
01:21:15,293 --> 01:21:17,210
GABRU, The Great!

921
01:21:31,043 --> 01:21:32,751
My hero...

922
01:21:35,376 --> 01:21:37,210
The crowd is in a crazy mood.

923
01:21:37,793 --> 01:21:39,085
Rock the show!

924
01:21:40,293 --> 01:21:41,376
Daddy, relax!

925
01:21:41,543 --> 01:21:42,626
You're adding to the pressure.

926
01:21:43,001 --> 01:21:45,751
What is your problem?

927
01:21:46,043 --> 01:21:49,710
We're just talking.
None of your business.

928
01:22:00,376 --> 01:22:01,335
I can't do this.

929
01:22:04,418 --> 01:22:06,751
Ricky, enough already!

930
01:22:06,751 --> 01:22:09,001
You want to turn him into Lady Gaga?

931
01:22:09,543 --> 01:22:10,251
Funny, eh?

932
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:13,001
Get lost.

933
01:22:13,876 --> 01:22:16,001
<i>I will</i> thrash you.

934
01:22:17,793 --> 01:22:19,876
Brother, I understand.

935
01:22:20,418 --> 01:22:23,710
If there's no fuel in the car,
will it run?

936
01:22:23,918 --> 01:22:25,751
<i>Never.</i>

937
01:22:26,293 --> 01:22:29,501
And our car is a
Range Rover.

938
01:22:30,043 --> 01:22:34,085
When you drive a Range Rover,
you need more fuel.

939
01:22:36,918 --> 01:22:38,251
Fuel.

940
01:22:38,876 --> 01:22:40,251
Now you tell me,

941
01:22:40,543 --> 01:22:42,085
who's the GABRU?

942
01:22:43,001 --> 01:22:43,835
Say it!

943
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:46,001
Get ready quickly.

944
01:22:46,251 --> 01:22:47,251
I am out of here.

945
01:22:49,168 --> 01:22:51,585
And yeah, I love you, too!

946
01:23:16,376 --> 01:23:17,876
Where is it?

947
01:23:21,376 --> 01:23:22,876
Can I say something, madam?

948
01:23:23,543 --> 01:23:24,501
Go on.

949
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:27,626
I...

950
01:23:31,918 --> 01:23:33,001
Sartaj...

951
01:23:33,418 --> 01:23:35,210
I want to take you on a date.

952
01:23:35,626 --> 01:23:36,710
Sartaj...

953
01:23:37,001 --> 01:23:38,460
Will you come to
a coffee shop with me?

954
01:23:38,751 --> 01:23:40,001
Sartaj?

955
01:23:56,918 --> 01:23:58,751
Madam...

956
01:24:00,043 --> 01:24:01,876
I've never seen a lady like you.

957
01:24:03,293 --> 01:24:05,376
You are surrounded by filth.

958
01:24:06,543 --> 01:24:08,876
Yet, you are absolutely clean.

959
01:24:11,168 --> 01:24:12,501
Dignity.

960
01:24:15,376 --> 01:24:17,376
Okay. Now get up.

961
01:24:22,418 --> 01:24:24,751
You sitting too far away, madam.

962
01:24:27,293 --> 01:24:28,876
Do you know?

963
01:24:30,001 --> 01:24:31,751
What hit me the most...

964
01:24:32,501 --> 01:24:37,501
Life's <i>worst</i> tragedy, Madam,

965
01:24:41,168 --> 01:24:45,376
To lose someone you love,

966
01:24:49,543 --> 01:24:52,001
And not being able
to do anything about it.

967
01:24:52,418 --> 01:24:54,251
Father had passed away.

968
01:24:55,418 --> 01:24:57,251
If my brother had too...

969
01:24:58,543 --> 01:25:00,835
That day, you didn't save
him, but me instead.

970
01:25:03,501 --> 01:25:06,001
Sartaj, look at me.

971
01:25:07,418 --> 01:25:08,001
Look at me.

972
01:25:08,168 --> 01:25:10,626
Now show me your tongue.

973
01:25:11,251 --> 01:25:13,835
Martyr Sartaj Singh.

974
01:25:15,543 --> 01:25:17,751
Nothing is going to happen to Balli.

975
01:25:19,043 --> 01:25:20,210
Nothing.

976
01:25:22,418 --> 01:25:23,626
Are you sure?

977
01:25:24,793 --> 01:25:25,876
Promise.

978
01:25:28,251 --> 01:25:31,501
Brave warrior-madam, Preet Sahni!

979
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:34,335
Commander, drugs on war.

980
01:25:35,251 --> 01:25:37,960
Not drugs on war,
war on drugs.

981
01:25:39,043 --> 01:25:40,418
And I am no hero.

982
01:25:40,418 --> 01:25:41,835
I am only trying.

983
01:25:43,793 --> 01:25:46,210
There are two wars going on in Punjab.

984
01:25:47,043 --> 01:25:48,751
The one you and I are fighting

985
01:25:49,543 --> 01:25:52,501
against people like Pehelwan,
against the system.

986
01:25:54,001 --> 01:25:56,210
That is easy.

987
01:25:57,876 --> 01:26:00,126
The real war on drugs...

988
01:26:00,126 --> 01:26:03,126
is the one that people
like Balli are fighting.

989
01:26:03,543 --> 01:26:05,085
With themselves.

990
01:26:08,168 --> 01:26:10,251
If they win, we win.

991
01:26:12,293 --> 01:26:13,751
If they lose, Punjab...

992
01:26:16,251 --> 01:26:17,460
loses!

993
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:23,751
And so, Punjab has lost!

994
01:26:26,168 --> 01:26:27,751
Sartaj...

995
01:26:28,251 --> 01:26:29,501
What happened?

996
01:26:33,293 --> 01:26:35,335
Okay. Come here.

997
01:27:28,918 --> 01:27:31,376
Where could she be?
- Look over there!

998
01:27:53,793 --> 01:28:02,335
Presenting Tommy, the GABRU!

999
01:28:26,918 --> 01:28:29,126
Bro, are you okay?

1000
01:28:32,626 --> 01:28:35,001
Rock and roll, bro.

1001
01:29:21,168 --> 01:29:27,001
GABRU!

1002
01:29:42,793 --> 01:29:48,085
GABRU!

1003
01:29:49,543 --> 01:29:51,126
Have you seen him?

1004
01:29:52,543 --> 01:29:54,085
Has anyone seen GABRU?

1005
01:29:56,293 --> 01:29:58,251
How will you see him?

1006
01:30:00,626 --> 01:30:03,001
Some are lying in the gutters.

1007
01:30:05,126 --> 01:30:07,751
Swimming in their own vomit.

1008
01:30:08,418 --> 01:30:10,960
And some have already
made it to the other side.

1009
01:30:11,251 --> 01:30:12,376
Dead!

1010
01:30:12,793 --> 01:30:14,626
Sing us a song already!

1011
01:30:15,418 --> 01:30:17,751
<i>I willsing a song, too.</i>

1012
01:30:18,126 --> 01:30:20,126
First, hear what I have to say.

1013
01:30:21,543 --> 01:30:23,251
Meet me.

1014
01:30:24,668 --> 01:30:26,751
Do you want to meet him?

1015
01:30:28,043 --> 01:30:33,251
Do you want to meet
the real Tommy Singh?

1016
01:30:34,626 --> 01:30:36,126
Statutory warning -

1017
01:30:36,293 --> 01:30:39,126
He's no GABRU!

1018
01:30:39,418 --> 01:30:41,751
Now, do you want to meet him?

1019
01:30:42,043 --> 01:30:46,210
Then... here is Tommy
Singh in 3,2,1...

1020
01:30:46,501 --> 01:30:48,751
<i>[L-O-S-E-R]</i>

1021
01:30:50,793 --> 01:30:53,210
This is Tommy Singh.

1022
01:30:54,043 --> 01:30:55,210
Loser!

1023
01:30:57,668 --> 01:31:01,001
A small town boy,
Tejender Singh Loser,

1024
01:31:03,376 --> 01:31:08,251
Scored a visa and went to
Birmingham, once upon a time.

1025
01:31:09,876 --> 01:31:12,543
Somehow his music worked.

1026
01:31:12,543 --> 01:31:15,376
Otherwise, he would be driving a cab.

1027
01:31:16,543 --> 01:31:18,585
Or waiting tables.

1028
01:31:19,668 --> 01:31:22,376
He scraped through high school.

1029
01:31:24,168 --> 01:31:26,501
He just knew one thing.

1030
01:31:28,418 --> 01:31:29,501
Drugs.

1031
01:31:32,793 --> 01:31:35,126
And he sang about it.

1032
01:31:38,043 --> 01:31:40,501
And you folks thought
it was philosophy?

1033
01:31:45,918 --> 01:31:51,751
You folks are bigger
losers than I am, fuckers!

1034
01:31:52,543 --> 01:31:55,835
Come on, sing the song already!

1035
01:31:56,043 --> 01:31:58,835
And you're the biggest loser,

1036
01:31:59,001 --> 01:32:00,876
since you still don't get it!

1037
01:32:01,043 --> 01:32:03,751
We aren't here for your sermons.

1038
01:32:04,043 --> 01:32:05,293
Sing or get lost!

1039
01:32:05,293 --> 01:32:06,626
Sing or get lost.

1040
01:32:06,626 --> 01:32:14,001
Sing or get lost!

1041
01:32:25,251 --> 01:32:26,918
You want to hear a song?

1042
01:32:26,918 --> 01:32:28,501
Do you?

1043
01:33:33,251 --> 01:33:35,126
Where's the car? Fuck!

1044
01:33:35,293 --> 01:33:37,126
Where is the Range Rover?

1045
01:33:38,668 --> 01:33:39,460
Oh damn!

1046
01:33:58,501 --> 01:34:01,126
He must be here somewhere.

1047
01:34:01,626 --> 01:34:03,126
Get the car quickly.

1048
01:34:27,293 --> 01:34:28,751
Stay back!

1049
01:34:29,793 --> 01:34:32,876
Let me hide.

1050
01:34:35,418 --> 01:34:36,876
Who are you?

1051
01:34:36,876 --> 01:34:38,043
Tommy.

1052
01:34:38,043 --> 01:34:39,043
A dog?

1053
01:34:39,043 --> 01:34:41,376
A singer. Tommy Singh.

1054
01:34:43,168 --> 01:34:44,751
Please let me hide.

1055
01:34:45,668 --> 01:34:47,543
Over there.

1056
01:34:47,543 --> 01:34:49,751
Thank you.
- Shut up!

1057
01:35:15,668 --> 01:35:17,001
Do you have stuff?

1058
01:35:24,418 --> 01:35:26,001
Who you hiding from?

1059
01:35:28,168 --> 01:35:29,126
From myself.

1060
01:35:29,293 --> 01:35:30,085
Huh?

1061
01:35:30,876 --> 01:35:32,001
From myself.

1062
01:35:33,918 --> 01:35:34,960
Moron.

1063
01:35:35,543 --> 01:35:37,001
The biggest one.

1064
01:35:38,043 --> 01:35:39,626
Not bigger than me, Tommy boy.

1065
01:35:39,626 --> 01:35:41,293
Oh, come on!

1066
01:35:41,293 --> 01:35:43,585
I am the champion of morons.

1067
01:35:44,043 --> 01:35:46,001
His Highness Moron Number One.

1068
01:35:48,168 --> 01:35:50,001
Look where I've landed up.

1069
01:35:50,918 --> 01:35:53,335
You think I lost my way here?

1070
01:35:53,668 --> 01:35:55,501
If you hear my story,
you'll shit your pants.

1071
01:35:55,668 --> 01:35:57,626
Let it be.

1072
01:35:58,418 --> 01:36:00,251
It is even written on my head.

1073
01:36:00,668 --> 01:36:04,085
<i>Look.</i>

1074
01:36:05,043 --> 01:36:06,085
<i>Look.</i>

1075
01:36:12,168 --> 01:36:14,376
That's L-O-S-E-R written.
- Yes, loser.

1076
01:36:15,501 --> 01:36:16,668
They mean the same thing.

1077
01:36:16,668 --> 01:36:18,210
How so?

1078
01:36:18,793 --> 01:36:21,210
A loser is a loser,
a moron is a moron.

1079
01:36:25,668 --> 01:36:27,585
That makes sense.

1080
01:36:28,668 --> 01:36:30,876
A loser is a loser...

1081
01:36:31,126 --> 01:36:32,876
and a moron is a moron.

1082
01:36:42,501 --> 01:36:44,876
Wear it.

1083
01:36:50,001 --> 01:36:52,876
I was wondering...

1084
01:36:54,126 --> 01:36:56,001
I wont be able to do it alone.

1085
01:37:00,418 --> 01:37:02,376
Will you commit suicide with me?

1086
01:37:04,793 --> 01:37:06,001
Get lost!

1087
01:37:08,001 --> 01:37:09,960
I am not that big a moron.

1088
01:37:11,793 --> 01:37:14,626
Loser, don't you plant
these ideas in my head.

1089
01:37:14,626 --> 01:37:16,001
Hit me. You also fucking hit me.

1090
01:37:16,001 --> 01:37:17,293
Then why are you talking rubbish?

1091
01:37:17,293 --> 01:37:19,710
What else should I do?

1092
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:22,501
Who wants to hear
the fucking right thing?

1093
01:37:22,668 --> 01:37:26,001
They only want rubbish which
I've said for four years.

1094
01:37:26,168 --> 01:37:28,001
Made <i>me</i> a pop star! The Fuck!

1095
01:37:28,293 --> 01:37:30,751
A pop star at fucking 22!

1096
01:37:31,043 --> 01:37:33,376
Asian underground number three.

1097
01:37:33,626 --> 01:37:35,876
Tommy, the GABRU!

1098
01:37:35,876 --> 01:37:38,001
And now... poof!

1099
01:37:39,876 --> 01:37:45,043
Think... if someone tells you
that your best times are over.

1100
01:37:45,043 --> 01:37:46,501
And they won't come back.

1101
01:37:46,668 --> 01:37:48,251
The stuff is finished.
Party over!

1102
01:37:48,251 --> 01:37:49,585
Go home.

1103
01:38:16,918 --> 01:38:17,960
Sorry.

1104
01:39:24,626 --> 01:39:27,876
Run away!

1105
01:39:31,751 --> 01:39:33,126
Bloody loser!

1106
01:39:33,543 --> 01:39:35,376
Why won't the good times come?

1107
01:39:35,543 --> 01:39:38,251
Look what's become of me...

1108
01:39:38,251 --> 01:39:39,751
I am no moron.

1109
01:39:39,751 --> 01:39:42,001
Hockey champion,
district player!

1110
01:39:42,001 --> 01:39:44,501
I thought I'd see good times
if I played state level.

1111
01:39:44,501 --> 01:39:46,626
But my father dropped dead.

1112
01:39:46,626 --> 01:39:47,543
When I got over that...

1113
01:39:47,543 --> 01:39:49,501
my hockey stick was
replaced with a sickle.

1114
01:39:49,668 --> 01:39:53,085
Left home, reached Sarhota
village to work in the farms.

1115
01:39:53,626 --> 01:39:55,793
One day a packet flew from the skies.

1116
01:39:55,793 --> 01:39:59,251
I thought, if I sold it,
I'd finally see good times.

1117
01:39:59,918 --> 01:40:02,418
That's it. The biggest fuck up!

1118
01:40:02,418 --> 01:40:03,876
I got busted, damn it!

1119
01:40:03,876 --> 01:40:05,793
They've turned me into an animal.

1120
01:40:05,793 --> 01:40:07,126
They took turns to do me...

1121
01:40:07,293 --> 01:40:09,626
Sometimes all motherfuckers together.

1122
01:40:09,793 --> 01:40:13,043
Do you know what
I've been through, loser?

1123
01:40:13,043 --> 01:40:14,626
Do you know? Do you?

1124
01:40:22,126 --> 01:40:25,751
Besides this,
everything else.

1125
01:40:26,918 --> 01:40:28,251
Do you understand?

1126
01:40:37,626 --> 01:40:38,835
Let's leave.

1127
01:41:02,293 --> 01:41:09,626
There's this big billboard
I can see from the window

1128
01:41:12,876 --> 01:41:17,376
An ad for a Goa holiday.

1129
01:41:21,543 --> 01:41:25,126
That's all I keep staring at
all the time, without a blink.

1130
01:41:26,918 --> 01:41:30,751
Because I believe that,
that is my 'good time'.

1131
01:41:32,043 --> 01:41:35,501
And that day will come.

1132
01:41:35,501 --> 01:41:38,001
And when it does, I will ask it.

1133
01:41:39,168 --> 01:41:42,085
Where were you all this while?

1134
01:41:42,543 --> 01:41:45,876
Waiting for me to be decimated?

1135
01:41:45,876 --> 01:41:47,835
Is that what it takes for you to come?

1136
01:41:48,418 --> 01:41:51,168
But here I am and
I refuse to fall apart!

1137
01:41:51,168 --> 01:41:54,501
I am standing right here!

1138
01:42:03,418 --> 01:42:05,001
Still waiting.

1139
01:42:11,418 --> 01:42:14,960
Your Punjab failed me, loser!

1140
01:42:17,626 --> 01:42:20,126
I've never touched a cigarette.

1141
01:42:20,293 --> 01:42:23,501
And now I'm hooked to the needle.

1142
01:42:27,168 --> 01:42:29,085
Why don't you quit it?

1143
01:42:32,626 --> 01:42:33,835
What?

1144
01:42:35,168 --> 01:42:36,501
Punjab?

1145
01:42:37,668 --> 01:42:39,376
Or the needle?

1146
01:42:40,418 --> 01:42:42,085
What is your name?

1147
01:43:35,793 --> 01:43:37,001
Sartaj?

1148
01:44:27,126 --> 01:44:31,126
Punjab police filed a case against Tommy
Singh for lewd and Lascivious behaviour.

1149
01:44:31,293 --> 01:44:35,376
The court has issued a non-bailable
warrant against Tommy Singh.

1150
01:44:35,376 --> 01:44:37,626
The Punjab government
has condemned this...

1151
01:44:37,793 --> 01:44:41,085
and has asked for Tommy's
immediate arrest.

1152
01:44:41,876 --> 01:44:45,251
Forgive her.
- I'm going to kill the bitch!

1153
01:44:45,418 --> 01:44:47,085
If the boss found out...

1154
01:44:47,376 --> 01:44:49,001
No. I will talk to her.

1155
01:44:49,168 --> 01:44:50,626
Please forgive her.

1156
01:44:50,793 --> 01:44:51,668
Brother...

1157
01:44:51,668 --> 01:44:53,043
Relax, let me handle it.

1158
01:44:53,043 --> 01:44:54,751
What is left of her anyway?

1159
01:44:55,418 --> 01:44:57,793
She's a chewed out bone.
Let's chop and throw her.

1160
01:44:57,793 --> 01:44:59,751
No. Let me talk to her.

1161
01:44:59,751 --> 01:45:03,335
Assure them you won't do it again.

1162
01:45:03,501 --> 01:45:04,501
<i>She won't.</i>

1163
01:45:04,668 --> 01:45:06,876
Bunch of sister fuckers!

1164
01:45:08,126 --> 01:45:10,001
Keep her under control.

1165
01:45:27,251 --> 01:45:29,001
I am really mad at you.

1166
01:45:31,043 --> 01:45:32,918
Baby, understand.

1167
01:45:32,918 --> 01:45:34,626
You can't manage
on your own.

1168
01:45:35,543 --> 01:45:37,335
Do you know how
expensive heroin is?

1169
01:45:38,543 --> 01:45:40,751
You'll have to sleep with
someone for money.

1170
01:45:41,043 --> 01:45:42,751
Will you like that?

1171
01:45:43,918 --> 01:45:46,251
They're only going to use you.

1172
01:45:48,543 --> 01:45:51,960
But, Sonu loves you, baby.

1173
01:45:53,543 --> 01:45:55,335
Baby...

1174
01:45:58,668 --> 01:46:02,335
Don't run away again. Okay?

1175
01:46:17,126 --> 01:46:18,001
Sartaj!

1176
01:46:19,126 --> 01:46:19,835
Come here!

1177
01:46:20,876 --> 01:46:21,501
<i>Look.</i>

1178
01:46:23,251 --> 01:46:25,251
Some Virender Singh
is behind all this.

1179
01:46:25,543 --> 01:46:26,876
The owner of Deluxe Pharmaceuticals.

1180
01:46:28,126 --> 01:46:30,251
Deluxe Pharmaceuticals is
the front in whose name...

1181
01:46:30,418 --> 01:46:32,626
government controlled
opium is being sourced.

1182
01:46:33,293 --> 01:46:34,335
It's a fake company.

1183
01:46:34,543 --> 01:46:36,210
There is nothing about it online.

1184
01:46:36,418 --> 01:46:38,376
The telephone numbers
also don't work.

1185
01:46:39,043 --> 01:46:40,501
But guess what I did?

1186
01:46:41,293 --> 01:46:43,543
I logged on to Registrar of
Companies website

1187
01:46:43,543 --> 01:46:45,085
and found out owner details.

1188
01:46:46,043 --> 01:46:48,626
It's some Virender Singh
from village Havelian.

1189
01:46:49,418 --> 01:46:50,585
Who is this Virender Singh?

1190
01:46:52,543 --> 01:46:54,876
I thought the owner would
be a big politician.

1191
01:46:55,418 --> 01:46:56,501
I don't know.

1192
01:46:57,168 --> 01:47:00,126
Could be a political stooge.

1193
01:47:08,543 --> 01:47:09,626
Madam...

1194
01:47:12,126 --> 01:47:14,126
Last night...

1195
01:47:14,918 --> 01:47:16,126
Are you okay now?

1196
01:47:16,126 --> 01:47:18,001
Balli, stop.

1197
01:47:23,126 --> 01:47:25,376
Let me go.
- Wait.

1198
01:47:27,543 --> 01:47:29,751
Chetan, hold him.

1199
01:47:29,918 --> 01:47:32,251
Balli, listen...

1200
01:47:41,293 --> 01:47:43,001
Thorazine, quick!

1201
01:47:43,001 --> 01:47:44,376
Balli?

1202
01:47:58,418 --> 01:48:00,251
Stop. Drop me here.

1203
01:48:12,251 --> 01:48:14,793
On Radio Bollywood,
I am your RJ Manveer.

1204
01:48:14,793 --> 01:48:19,251
It's 9 AM. Tommy Singh's been
absconding for the past 12 hours.

1205
01:48:19,626 --> 01:48:20,501
<i>Bro, Tommy'.!</i>

1206
01:48:21,168 --> 01:48:23,001
What's going on, brother?

1207
01:48:26,168 --> 01:48:28,251
Tommy, you have any idea...

1208
01:48:35,543 --> 01:48:36,876
I have lots to tell you.

1209
01:48:37,043 --> 01:48:37,626
What happened?

1210
01:48:37,626 --> 01:48:38,876
Come with me.
- What happened?

1211
01:48:39,168 --> 01:48:40,626
Sit down.

1212
01:48:41,043 --> 01:48:42,751
First let's check into a hotel.

1213
01:48:42,751 --> 01:48:45,043
I have to freshen up.

1214
01:48:45,043 --> 01:48:47,918
I haven't eaten since last night.

1215
01:48:47,918 --> 01:48:51,001
And there's this girl
that I have to save.

1216
01:48:52,918 --> 01:48:55,876
For once think of someone
other than yourself, asshole!

1217
01:48:56,126 --> 01:48:59,418
Do you know where my dad is, Tommy?

1218
01:48:59,418 --> 01:49:01,126
They've put him in jail.

1219
01:49:01,501 --> 01:49:05,168
The police must be beating him
asking him where Tommy is.

1220
01:49:05,168 --> 01:49:06,626
If it were up to me, Tommy...

1221
01:49:06,626 --> 01:49:09,376
I'd hand you over
to the police myself.

1222
01:49:11,543 --> 01:49:15,585
But you do as you please,
you're on your own now.

1223
01:49:17,126 --> 01:49:18,293
And forgive me.

1224
01:49:18,293 --> 01:49:20,876
Jassi, listen.
- I don't want to listen.

1225
01:49:20,876 --> 01:49:22,168
It's not what you think.

1226
01:49:22,168 --> 01:49:26,168
The girl's in deep trouble,
some heroin mafia shit.

1227
01:49:26,168 --> 01:49:28,251
We need some money
to get her released.

1228
01:49:28,418 --> 01:49:31,626
After that I will do
whatever you ask...

1229
01:49:32,001 --> 01:49:33,001
Surrender.

1230
01:49:34,668 --> 01:49:35,960
You were my hero.

1231
01:49:36,418 --> 01:49:39,168
When you came from London,
I danced with joy.

1232
01:49:39,168 --> 01:49:40,585
'My cool cousin!'
'My cool cousin!'

1233
01:49:41,043 --> 01:49:43,001
Sisterfucker!
Now just look at this 'cool cousin'.

1234
01:49:44,043 --> 01:49:45,210
GABRU's crew tee.

1235
01:49:46,418 --> 01:49:48,126
I used to wear it with pride.

1236
01:49:53,043 --> 01:49:55,210
To hell with it, sisterfucker!

1237
01:49:56,418 --> 01:49:57,251
Jassi.

1238
01:49:57,251 --> 01:50:00,085
There's no love in your heart,
only cocaine.

1239
01:50:00,668 --> 01:50:02,001
Remember that, f****r!

1240
01:50:02,168 --> 01:50:03,751
Listen up.
- Jassi is dead.

1241
01:50:03,751 --> 01:50:04,585
Your uncle is dead.

1242
01:50:04,876 --> 01:50:06,876
It's not what you think.

1243
01:50:07,043 --> 01:50:08,835
We have to save her!

1244
01:50:23,293 --> 01:50:25,501
Sometimes I get high
with just your touch.

1245
01:50:30,918 --> 01:50:35,835
<i>"Girl, I am standing by your side,
Won't budge an inch even if I died."</i>

1246
01:50:36,126 --> 01:50:40,960
<i>"Girl, I am standing by your side,
Won't budge an inch even if I died."</i>

1247
01:50:41,293 --> 01:50:44,043
<i>For you, my white angel,
I quit the white powder</i>

1248
01:50:44,043 --> 01:50:46,335
<i>Hide me, don't let me cower.</i>

1249
01:50:46,543 --> 01:50:48,751
<i>For you, my white angel,
I quit the white powder,</i>

1250
01:50:48,918 --> 01:50:51,251
<i>Hide me, don't let me cower.</i>

1251
01:50:55,751 --> 01:50:57,835
Sir, we've reached Sarhota.

1252
01:50:58,043 --> 01:51:00,126
Is this Sarhota?
- Yes.

1253
01:51:11,668 --> 01:51:14,001
There this girl, from your village.

1254
01:51:14,418 --> 01:51:15,335
Which block?

1255
01:51:16,043 --> 01:51:17,126
Don't know.

1256
01:51:18,251 --> 01:51:19,251
Name?

1257
01:51:19,543 --> 01:51:20,585
Don't know that either.

1258
01:51:21,793 --> 01:51:24,001
Idiots get me riled,
early in the morning!

1259
01:51:25,293 --> 01:51:27,043
She may be from Bihar.

1260
01:51:27,043 --> 01:51:28,751
From Bihar?

1261
01:51:29,918 --> 01:51:34,626
Maybe at Karnail Singh's fields?
Lot of women from Bihar work there.

1262
01:51:36,251 --> 01:51:37,626
She ran away.

1263
01:51:38,168 --> 01:51:39,835
Didn't <i>even</i> take her stuff along.

1264
01:51:40,418 --> 01:51:42,626
Who did she go with?

1265
01:51:43,043 --> 01:51:44,001
Do you know anything?

1266
01:51:44,876 --> 01:51:46,543
No idea, sir.

1267
01:51:46,543 --> 01:51:48,835
She was the silent type.

1268
01:51:49,043 --> 01:51:50,626
Her name?

1269
01:51:51,293 --> 01:51:53,251
She had a strange name.

1270
01:51:54,376 --> 01:51:57,251
Pushpa, what was
the hockey girl's name?

1271
01:51:57,418 --> 01:52:00,626
What do I know?
I used to call her 'birdbrain'.

1272
01:52:27,543 --> 01:52:30,376
Who is the dealer over here?

1273
01:52:31,418 --> 01:52:32,501
Tell me, you fucker!

1274
01:52:34,001 --> 01:52:38,751
You can take some from me if you want.

1275
01:52:38,751 --> 01:52:42,001
Supply is down.

1276
01:52:42,501 --> 01:52:43,501
Cut it out!!

1277
01:52:46,918 --> 01:52:48,251
What happened?

1278
01:52:49,043 --> 01:52:52,251
Our dealer,
Bhandi, is in the hospital.

1279
01:52:53,543 --> 01:52:57,876
His gang beat him up over a bad deal.

1280
01:52:59,668 --> 01:53:02,585
Okay then, have a nice day!

1281
01:53:03,293 --> 01:53:06,335
Holy shit! Doesn't he
look just like Tommy?

1282
01:53:06,626 --> 01:53:08,710
Yeah, bro!

1283
01:53:09,168 --> 01:53:11,001
[GABRU]

1284
01:53:39,126 --> 01:53:43,210
Why would an MD of a pharma
company live here?

1285
01:53:44,543 --> 01:53:46,376
You listening?

1286
01:53:46,543 --> 01:53:47,501
Praise the lord!

1287
01:53:54,543 --> 01:53:55,751
That's a nice house.

1288
01:53:55,918 --> 01:53:57,710
Grace of God.

1289
01:53:59,418 --> 01:54:01,376
Mobiles don't work in our village.

1290
01:54:01,668 --> 01:54:03,710
But I have a phone at home.

1291
01:54:04,251 --> 01:54:07,418
You can speak to Virender
if you want

1292
01:54:07,418 --> 01:54:08,460
No, that's fine.

1293
01:54:08,668 --> 01:54:11,001
Since we were around,
we thought we'd say hello.

1294
01:54:11,001 --> 01:54:12,126
It's been a while.

1295
01:54:13,418 --> 01:54:14,710
What's he up to these days?

1296
01:54:14,918 --> 01:54:16,793
Same. Driving.

1297
01:54:16,793 --> 01:54:18,043
Private car?

1298
01:54:18,043 --> 01:54:22,126
Yes. With Amar Pal Singh.

1299
01:54:26,043 --> 01:54:29,001
Mr. Brar's son-in-law.

1300
01:54:30,001 --> 01:54:31,293
Maninder Brar?

1301
01:54:31,293 --> 01:54:32,543
Yes.

1302
01:54:32,543 --> 01:54:34,543
I remember.

1303
01:54:34,543 --> 01:54:37,251
Virender had mentioned
that they are like family

1304
01:54:37,918 --> 01:54:40,210
Hey, get the family album.

1305
01:54:47,418 --> 01:54:52,501
Mr. Brar's entire family had danced
at my son's wedding.

1306
01:54:54,293 --> 01:54:56,585
There was so much pomp.

1307
01:54:58,876 --> 01:55:00,251
Virender is looking so good.

1308
01:55:00,418 --> 01:55:01,501
Of course.

1309
01:55:02,418 --> 01:55:03,460
We must be going.

1310
01:55:34,168 --> 01:55:36,001
Left from here.
- Yes.

1311
01:55:38,043 --> 01:55:39,501
Oh no.

1312
01:55:43,793 --> 01:55:45,001
What happened?

1313
01:55:46,001 --> 01:55:47,626
Police.

1314
01:55:58,668 --> 01:55:59,626
Greetings.

1315
01:55:59,626 --> 01:56:00,876
What is it?

1316
01:56:01,418 --> 01:56:03,043
How is everything?
- All good.

1317
01:56:03,043 --> 01:56:05,126
I was saying...

1318
01:56:05,126 --> 01:56:07,668
Get out of here, bloody junkies!

1319
01:56:07,668 --> 01:56:08,418
Get lost!

1320
01:56:08,418 --> 01:56:10,001
Relax, will you.

1321
01:56:10,168 --> 01:56:11,251
What happened to the boy?

1322
01:56:11,418 --> 01:56:15,376
I think he's got an attack.

1323
01:56:21,293 --> 01:56:23,751
Doctor!

1324
01:56:33,501 --> 01:56:35,626
Don't hit me more.

1325
01:56:35,626 --> 01:56:37,876
No. Don't worry. Be quiet.

1326
01:56:38,126 --> 01:56:39,835
I am your brother.

1327
01:56:40,043 --> 01:56:43,251
Your brother's been beaten
to pulp, my man.

1328
01:56:43,418 --> 01:56:45,001
I know, bro. I know.

1329
01:56:45,168 --> 01:56:46,626
But there this girl.

1330
01:56:46,626 --> 01:56:49,668
Fuckers fed me to Jackie.

1331
01:56:49,668 --> 01:56:51,126
Listen to me.

1332
01:56:51,126 --> 01:56:53,168
Fucker, chewed out my bones.

1333
01:56:53,168 --> 01:56:54,126
Bloody listen!

1334
01:56:54,126 --> 01:56:57,751
This girl from Bihar who is in
trouble with the heroin mafia.

1335
01:56:57,918 --> 01:57:00,585
It's very important that I meet her.

1336
01:57:00,918 --> 01:57:04,626
I've never done anything for anyone.

1337
01:57:04,626 --> 01:57:06,835
Let me do this once.

1338
01:57:07,043 --> 01:57:08,001
It'll set me free.

1339
01:57:12,543 --> 01:57:16,251
Sorry. Listen to me.

1340
01:57:16,418 --> 01:57:17,501
Listen to me.

1341
01:57:17,501 --> 01:57:21,876
After a long time,
there's a tune in my head.

1342
01:57:23,168 --> 01:57:25,376
And it is thanks to the girl.

1343
01:57:26,001 --> 01:57:28,585
Ever since I've met her,

1344
01:57:29,043 --> 01:57:31,501
I just don't feel like taking cocaine.

1345
01:57:32,126 --> 01:57:35,168
I've got my 'mojo' back.

1346
01:57:35,168 --> 01:57:38,126
You know mojo, man. It's back!

1347
01:57:39,543 --> 01:57:40,751
Tommy?
- Yes.

1348
01:57:40,918 --> 01:57:41,501
Tommy.

1349
01:57:41,668 --> 01:57:43,376
Dude.

1350
01:57:43,376 --> 01:57:44,501
Where is the girl?
- THE Tommy.

1351
01:57:44,501 --> 01:57:46,585
Where is the girl?

1352
01:57:48,543 --> 01:57:49,376
Sing me a song.

1353
01:57:49,543 --> 01:57:50,626
Just one song.
- Who is inside?

1354
01:57:50,626 --> 01:57:51,793
I can't sing here.

1355
01:57:51,793 --> 01:57:53,585
It'll make me feel lot better.

1356
01:57:54,918 --> 01:57:55,501
Tell me.

1357
01:57:55,668 --> 01:57:57,210
Sing-
. okay-

1358
01:57:58,543 --> 01:58:00,043
You'll have to tell me then!

1359
01:58:00,043 --> 01:58:01,210
Sure.

1360
01:58:02,043 --> 01:58:04,210
Just one song!
- Okay, calm down!

1361
01:58:07,418 --> 01:58:15,501
<i>A girl whose name is Love,</i>

1362
01:58:16,543 --> 01:58:25,126
<i>She is lost... is lost... is lost.</i>

1363
01:58:27,043 --> 01:58:34,960
<i>Her saintly charm,
her sublime beauty.</i>

1364
01:58:35,376 --> 01:58:43,460
<i>She is lost... is lost... is lost.</i>

1365
01:58:45,501 --> 01:58:53,126
Her face is ethereal,

1366
01:58:53,543 --> 01:59:00,710
<i>Warmth, like Mary's embrace.</i>

1367
01:59:01,293 --> 01:59:03,001
Sultanpura.

1368
01:59:04,043 --> 01:59:05,043
What?

1369
01:59:05,043 --> 01:59:06,835
Sultanpura.

1370
01:59:13,293 --> 01:59:15,043
Catch him.

1371
01:59:15,043 --> 01:59:17,001
Don't let him get away.

1372
01:59:17,001 --> 01:59:18,210
I won't spare you today.

1373
01:59:31,418 --> 01:59:38,210
<i>A girl whose name is Love,</i>

1374
01:59:38,751 --> 01:59:44,126
<i>She is lost... is lost... is lost.</i>

1375
01:59:47,418 --> 01:59:54,418
<i>A girl whose name is Love,</i>

1376
01:59:54,418 --> 02:00:00,251
<i>She is lost... is lost... is lost.</i>

1377
02:00:02,793 --> 02:00:10,126
<i>Her saintly charm,
her sublime beauty.</i>

1378
02:00:10,418 --> 02:00:16,585
<i>She is lost... is lost... is lost.</i>

1379
02:00:18,418 --> 02:00:24,001
<i>She is lost... is lost... is lost.</i>

1380
02:00:26,668 --> 02:00:33,751
Her face is ethereal,

1381
02:00:34,168 --> 02:00:41,376
<i>Warmth, like Mary's embrace</i>

1382
02:00:42,668 --> 02:00:50,210
Her smile makes the flowers bloom.

1383
02:00:50,543 --> 02:00:58,335
<i>Her gait feels like a moving sonnet.</i>

1384
02:00:59,043 --> 02:01:05,960
<i>Tall as a cypress in winter,</i>

1385
02:01:07,168 --> 02:01:13,876
<i>Young as a budding ember.</i>

1386
02:01:14,543 --> 02:01:22,376
Yet she knows what the eyes speak.

1387
02:01:27,418 --> 02:01:34,376
<i>A girl whose name is Love,</i>

1388
02:01:34,626 --> 02:01:40,251
<i>She is lost... is lost... is lost.</i>

1389
02:01:59,293 --> 02:02:06,626
<i>A girl whose name is Love,</i>

1390
02:02:06,626 --> 02:02:12,751
<i>She is lost... is lost... is lost.</i>

1391
02:02:15,543 --> 02:02:23,126
<i>Her saintly charm,

1392
02:02:24,626 --> 02:02:29,376
<i>She is lost... is lost... is lost.</i>

1393
02:02:30,918 --> 02:02:38,251
<i>She is lost... is lost... is lost.</i>

1394
02:02:41,043 --> 02:02:42,126
Done?

1395
02:02:54,501 --> 02:02:56,001
So, Chandigarh tomorrow at seven?

1396
02:02:56,626 --> 02:02:57,376
Yes.

1397
02:02:58,918 --> 02:03:00,876
Let's give the Election commission
a couple of days.

1398
02:03:01,126 --> 02:03:03,876
If nothing happens,
we will approach the media.

1399
02:03:04,168 --> 02:03:05,876
But I am sure, it'll work out.

1400
02:03:08,043 --> 02:03:09,501
Thank you, madam.

1401
02:03:11,168 --> 02:03:14,085
Whenever <i>I'll</i> look into the
mirror to tie my turban...

1402
02:03:15,126 --> 02:03:17,210
I'll feel a little less ashamed.

1403
02:03:24,251 --> 02:03:26,210
Okay... ta ta!

1404
02:03:34,418 --> 02:03:36,585
Madam, I've been wanting
to say something

1405
02:03:36,793 --> 02:03:38,001
I messed it up that evening.

1406
02:03:39,043 --> 02:03:41,876
The thing is that... you are so...

1407
02:03:44,918 --> 02:03:46,751
You are so perfect that...

1408
02:03:50,168 --> 02:03:51,626
Ta ta!

1409
02:04:03,668 --> 02:04:08,501
Sartaj. Sartaj, wait up.

1410
02:04:13,418 --> 02:04:15,876
Tomorrow when we're done...

1411
02:04:16,043 --> 02:04:17,751
do you want to have coffee with me?

1412
02:04:19,418 --> 02:04:20,626
At a cafe?

1413
02:04:22,876 --> 02:04:24,501
You came all the way
to ask me this?

1414
02:04:25,168 --> 02:04:26,126
Yes.

1415
02:04:30,126 --> 02:04:30,960
<i>Okay.</i>

1416
02:04:31,793 --> 02:04:32,751
Okay?

1417
02:05:13,793 --> 02:05:15,335
What happened, kiddo?

1418
02:05:15,626 --> 02:05:18,001
The water is over. I am thirsty.

1419
02:05:18,168 --> 02:05:20,710
Thirsty? What did you
have for dinner?

1420
02:05:21,501 --> 02:05:23,585
Give me your jug.

1421
02:05:23,876 --> 02:05:25,376
Where are you?

1422
02:05:31,293 --> 02:05:32,626
Give it to me.

1423
02:05:32,793 --> 02:05:34,335
This is not a toy.

1424
02:05:35,043 --> 02:05:36,251
This is not a toy.

1425
02:05:36,918 --> 02:05:38,376
Some one will get hurt.

1426
02:05:39,043 --> 02:05:40,376
Give it to me.

1427
02:06:10,793 --> 02:06:15,876
Everything okay?

1428
02:06:18,668 --> 02:06:22,751
Kiddo, let's go in.

1429
02:06:26,418 --> 02:06:28,876
Listen to me, Balli.

1430
02:06:32,376 --> 02:06:37,960
Let me go.
- Balli, wait!

1431
02:08:17,626 --> 02:08:20,501
Motherfucker! Were you
warming your balls here?

1432
02:08:28,418 --> 02:08:30,001
You haven't told anyone, right?

1433
02:08:30,168 --> 02:08:31,626
How can you say that, sir?

1434
02:08:31,626 --> 02:08:33,126
Your cousin is my cousin.

1435
02:09:00,543 --> 02:09:02,835
It's okay... Don't stress.

1436
02:09:04,168 --> 02:09:05,626
Your brother, Jujhar is here.

1437
02:09:06,793 --> 02:09:08,626
There's a safe-house in Sultanpura.

1438
02:09:09,751 --> 02:09:11,626
Go underground there for some time.

1439
02:09:13,876 --> 02:09:15,501
Don't lose hope.

1440
02:09:16,876 --> 02:09:17,626
Alright?

1441
02:09:18,918 --> 02:09:19,960
Nopi.

1442
02:09:21,626 --> 02:09:22,168
Sir.

1443
02:09:22,168 --> 02:09:24,001
Take him to the safe-house.

1444
02:09:24,376 --> 02:09:25,376
I'll inform them.

1445
02:09:25,376 --> 02:09:26,210
Okay, let's go.

1446
02:09:50,918 --> 02:09:52,251
Hold her head.

1447
02:09:54,668 --> 02:09:56,251
Come on.

1448
02:09:56,418 --> 02:09:58,085
Switch on the light.
- Yes sir.

1449
02:09:58,293 --> 02:09:59,626
I'll create a crime scene here.

1450
02:09:59,793 --> 02:10:02,376
You wash the blood outside. Quick!

1451
02:10:20,376 --> 02:10:21,876
Where are you?

1452
02:10:22,043 --> 02:10:23,876
Sorry, I was riding.

1453
02:10:25,293 --> 02:10:25,876
- What happened?

1454
02:10:26,126 --> 02:10:27,376
Come to the clinic.

1455
02:10:27,543 --> 02:10:29,126
Balli has created a mess.

1456
02:11:07,501 --> 02:11:09,335
Motherfucker!

1457
02:11:26,168 --> 02:11:28,960
Be careful. The floor is wet.

1458
02:12:11,043 --> 02:12:12,376
Motherfucker!

1459
02:14:07,043 --> 02:14:16,001
Today, a large number of Punjab youth
is in drug addiction.

1460
02:14:16,168 --> 02:14:22,335
Many house have
at least one drug addict.

1461
02:14:23,418 --> 02:14:32,626
Sir, if this vicious narco-politics
is not stopped,

1462
02:14:33,168 --> 02:14:37,001
Punjab will soon become like Mexico.

1463
02:14:38,043 --> 02:14:40,876
I hear that Mexican
girls are really hot.

1464
02:14:41,043 --> 02:14:43,751
J Lo... Jennifer Lopez.

1465
02:14:43,918 --> 02:14:47,001
Such a derriere can be found only
in Mexico, or in Punjab.

1466
02:14:47,168 --> 02:14:48,585
Really?
- Isn't it?

1467
02:14:52,126 --> 02:14:53,126
<i>Fucker.</i> I

1468
02:14:57,793 --> 02:15:03,001
You should've at least kept
my name out of the list.

1469
02:15:05,293 --> 02:15:06,501
Mine's there, too.

1470
02:15:08,501 --> 02:15:12,251
As kid brothers, we weren't shy to
even show each others' dicks.

1471
02:15:14,293 --> 02:15:18,085
I got you this job.
I helped you keep it too.

1472
02:15:19,918 --> 02:15:21,876
And you betrayed me for that bitch?

1473
02:15:24,918 --> 02:15:26,460
It's not about you or me.

1474
02:15:27,751 --> 02:15:28,751
Then who is it about?

1475
02:15:31,168 --> 02:15:32,001
Punjab.

1476
02:15:32,543 --> 02:15:35,210
Fucker, you think
Punjab belongs to your daddy?

1477
02:15:38,251 --> 02:15:39,835
Motherfucker!

1478
02:15:40,626 --> 02:15:41,585
Son...

1479
02:15:42,543 --> 02:15:44,126
Too late to save now...

1480
02:15:45,293 --> 02:15:48,501
Lands are dry and kids are high.

1481
02:16:15,293 --> 02:16:17,001
Good morning, baby.

1482
02:16:17,376 --> 02:16:18,751
Bed tea for...

1483
02:16:19,168 --> 02:16:20,585
What are you doing?

1484
02:17:51,918 --> 02:17:53,376
Don't shoot.

1485
02:19:43,626 --> 02:19:44,251
There's a dog there.

1486
02:19:44,418 --> 02:19:45,585
Come this way.

1487
02:19:47,793 --> 02:19:48,501
Be careful.

1488
02:20:07,626 --> 02:20:10,085
Hey you... Girl!

1489
02:20:10,918 --> 02:20:12,876
At least tell me your name.

1490
02:21:19,293 --> 02:21:21,585
Is the Sultanpura massacre
leading to a can of worms?

1491
02:21:21,751 --> 02:21:23,001
What's in that file at crime scene...

1492
02:21:23,168 --> 02:21:26,251
that's got Punjab government
to swing into action?

1493
02:21:26,418 --> 02:21:30,376
An Inquiry Committee has
been set up against MP Brar.

1494
02:21:30,376 --> 02:21:37,335
I beg the media not to drag
my family in this matter.

1495
02:21:37,876 --> 02:21:39,876
Why speculate the
involvement of my family?

1496
02:21:40,168 --> 02:21:42,960
Sir... Sir!

1497
02:21:44,418 --> 02:21:46,668
Tommy, how are you?

1498
02:21:46,668 --> 02:21:49,626
Let it be.
You don't miss me.

1499
02:21:50,543 --> 02:21:51,626
You are busy in jail, too?

1500
02:21:51,793 --> 02:21:59,876
<i>'The weather is crazy today.'</i>

1501
02:22:00,793 --> 02:22:05,793
What is this green stuff?

1502
02:22:05,793 --> 02:22:07,751
Get me some buttermilk.

1503
02:22:17,251 --> 02:22:19,126
I don't understand her, too.

1504
02:22:19,126 --> 02:22:21,501
Remember,
a brother before a lover. Okay?

1505
02:22:23,126 --> 02:22:24,501
He is asking your name.

1506
02:22:34,418 --> 02:22:35,876
Mary Jane.

1507
02:22:36,043 --> 02:22:37,626
Eh?

1508
02:22:37,626 --> 02:22:39,043
As in, my beloved?

1509
02:22:39,043 --> 02:22:41,876
You guys!
Her name is Mary Jane.

1510
02:22:41,876 --> 02:22:44,460
Not your Jane.
My Jane, my Mary Jane.

1511
02:22:44,751 --> 02:22:46,251
Mary Jane, my beloved!

1512
02:22:46,543 --> 02:22:48,501
Mary Jane, my beloved!

1513
02:22:52,251 --> 02:22:53,001
Spoke to her?

1514
02:24:15,251 --> 02:24:20,543
<i>Born along the blessed five rivers</i>

1515
02:24:20,543 --> 02:24:25,751
<i>Bred in this soil, our motherland.</i>

1516
02:24:25,751 --> 02:24:31,835
<i>Brother, now don't sing out of tune</i>

1517
02:24:32,043 --> 02:24:36,960
<i>God is watching over us from above.</i>

1518
02:24:37,418 --> 02:24:41,126
<i>But us earthlings are lost
In our own trance.</i>

1519
02:24:41,418 --> 02:24:46,126
<i>So question your conscience.</i>

1520
02:24:46,543 --> 02:24:51,460
<i>Peep in the mirror within.</i>

1521
02:24:51,876 --> 02:24:56,751
<i>Know this, the eternal truth:</i>

1522
02:24:57,043 --> 02:25:03,501
<i>His divinity is in every being.</i>

1523
02:25:03,793 --> 02:25:07,210
<i>Live it, celebrate it!</i>

1524
02:25:09,043 --> 02:25:12,501
<i>Live it, celebrate it!</i>

1525
02:25:14,251 --> 02:25:17,626
It's the essence of our existence.

1526
02:25:19,501 --> 02:25:23,501
<i>Live it, celebrate it!</i>

1527
02:25:44,876 --> 02:25:47,376
<i>Watch over yourselves.</i>

1528
02:25:47,543 --> 02:25:49,960
<i>Look for the path of righteousness.</i>

1529
02:25:50,168 --> 02:25:55,126
<i>Beloved mother is
waiting with open arms</i>

1530
02:25:55,293 --> 02:25:58,043
<i>Let's ward off the
evil that hurts our land.</i>

1531
02:25:58,043 --> 02:26:00,626
<i>Let's exorcise this demon.</i>

1532
02:26:01,168 --> 02:26:04,960
<i>Come back home, now!</i>

1533
02:26:06,168 --> 02:26:11,126
<i>Don't let these tears turn you weak.</i>

1534
02:26:11,293 --> 02:26:14,960
<i>A promise you owe to your land.</i>

1535
02:26:15,293 --> 02:26:20,085
<i>So question your conscience.</i>

1536
02:26:20,376 --> 02:26:25,085
<i>Peep in the mirror within.</i>

1537
02:26:25,668 --> 02:26:30,710
<i>Know this, the eternal truth:</i>

1538
02:26:30,918 --> 02:26:36,960
<i>His divinity is in every being.</i>

1539
02:26:37,793 --> 02:26:41,085
<i>Live it, celebrate it!</i>

1540
02:26:43,001 --> 02:26:46,251
<i>Live it, celebrate it!</i>

1541
02:26:48,168 --> 02:26:51,501
It's the essence of our existence.

1542
02:26:53,418 --> 02:26:56,501
<i>Live it, celebrate it!</i>
