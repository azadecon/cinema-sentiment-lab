1
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:32,535
What's that?

2
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,635
Not that.

3
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,397
What is it?

4
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:39,534
Not that. No!

5
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:45,909
What's this for?

6
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,811
People have an eye on you.

7
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,351
To get their hands on you.

8
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,721
Will you kill them all?

9
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,855
I will if needed...

10
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,867
They are well-connected people.

11
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,330
It's hard to escape them.

12
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,497
I will abduct you.

13
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,501
I like your attitude.

14
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,810
Don't waste them unnecessarily...

15
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,452
I can't go through all this.

16
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,552
I know.

17
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,556
You need to be 'Handled with Care'.

18
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,600
The elections are
coming up next year.

19
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,673
I was thinking of
running as a candidate.

20
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,571
You will lose.

21
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:49,808
I know.

22
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,442
First time is only
to gain experience.

23
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,882
Next time, I will surely win.

24
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,547
And then, we'll get married. Proudly.

25
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,584
Okay?

26
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,322
You mean, another five years.

27
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,656
Oh, yes, five years.

28
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,368
What if you lose again?

29
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,295
Then I'll have to abduct you.

30
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,506
Why don't we get engaged till then?

31
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,168
Here.

32
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:31,312
Prince lnderjeet Singh
with Princess Ranjana.

33
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:08,447
What's this for, sister-in-law?

34
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,186
Param's got a job
with the police force.

35
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,524
Very good. Bravo.

36
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,529
He's younger to you.

37
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,789
Yes, but he's still my brother.

38
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,630
Now he's a police officer.

39
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,476
On his way to Jhansi.

40
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,779
Where are you going
dressed so quaintly?

41
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,445
Did you join the circus?

42
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,588
There's a political
meeting at the town square.

43
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,588
I've been invited to give a speech.

44
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,757
If you find the time,
come and root for me.

45
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:46,395
Don't start abusing instead.

46
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,324
Otherwise, I will have to come
down to the police station again...

47
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,366
to bail you out.

48
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:54,336
Father, people love
to hear me cuss as well.

49
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,237
You're a teacher,
but people call me 'Raja Bhaiyya'.

50
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:09,713
Good day, Raja Bhaiyya.

51
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:10,978
Everyone's here?

52
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,688
We're just waiting for Mr. Mehra.

53
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,348
Go inside and take a seat.

54
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,482
Who is Mehra?

55
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,254
Did you tell him I am coming?
- Yes, I did.

56
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,227
Come on, let's go. - Let's Go.

57
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,732
This way. - Listen.

58
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,700
Keep this. That's 2000. - Yes.

59
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,499
Publish my photo
in the newspaper. - Yes.

60
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:29,937
Come, brother. This way.

61
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:32,736
Come, brother.

62
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,310
Are the arrangements okay?
- Wonderful.

63
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,914
Hello, sir. -Welcome, Mr. Mehra.

64
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,388
Take it.

65
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,674
Will I have to come
down to the police station?

66
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:50,953
Stop.

67
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,415
Stop.

68
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:00,622
Stop.

69
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,270
Listen to me, brother.

70
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:12,440
Brother... listen to me.

71
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,539
Stand up. - Brother...

72
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,482
I paid you for the
entire face. - Yes.

73
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,552
All you published was my hand.

74
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,917
Yes.

75
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,451
I will return your money.

76
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,425
All of it. Every cent.

77
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,797
What? - I swear.
I will return the money.

78
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,264
You think I was beating
you for the money.

79
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,493
No...

80
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:50,439
Experts feel that this
election will be fought...

81
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,743
on just one issue,
and that's division of the state.

82
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,482
The government will have to...

83
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,554
I hope you will cure me
before the next elections, Bakshi.

84
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,888
You will be walking without
any support within a year.

85
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,799
That's my guarantee.

86
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,629
Slowly.

87
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,808
Which fool brought these video games?

88
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,974
He doesn't want me to get well soon.

89
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,945
I want to dance without
anyone's support.

90
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,393
Greetings, Her Highness.

91
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,859
Son, I want to see you dance as well.

92
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,025
Greetings, Rani Ma.

93
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:46,863
After you're cured...

94
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,838
your first duty is to
give this family a successor.

95
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:58,009
Your daughter-in-law
is no longer fit for this job.

96
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,311
She's just my official wife now.

97
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,985
And the government's
good for nothing.

98
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,792
Then get married again.

99
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,789
How did come up with that idea?

100
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,866
It's like showing
Switzerland to the blind.

101
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:24,965
Ranjana. Bunny's daughter.

102
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,809
Did you have a word? - Yes.

103
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,481
So, should we start
packing for Switzerland?

104
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:50,391
Hello, It's Rudra Singh.

105
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,864
Hi, Rudy. How are you?

106
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,830
There's a problem.

107
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,809
Official? - No, personal.

108
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,437
Woman.

109
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:08,881
The government took away our powers,
but not nature.

110
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,449
So, who was it?

111
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:15,321
Dhanraj Makhija,
a businessman from Agra.

112
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,296
I would get him small
tenders in my area.

113
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,832
One day he visited me
in the hotel with his wife.

114
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,260
This time,
it was a 2 million bridge tender.

115
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,835
Rudra Pratap. Remember I told you...

116
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,602
I'm sure the bridge was
constructed the same day.

117
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,904
The rascal made a video.

118
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,239
He's threatening me now.

119
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,575
Wants all the tenders in the area.

120
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,350
A businessman,
who's not scared of the MLA.

121
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:44,417
You must be the only
politician in the country...

122
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,248
who doesn't scare anybody.

123
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,585
Forget that, what's the solution?

124
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:53,797
Makhija's trying to blackmail you,
using his wife.

125
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,464
Possible.

126
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,801
Maybe he wants to
get rid of his wife too.

127
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,299
But, I'm sure his wife
has no clue about it.

128
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,604
And you will tell her.

129
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,575
And explain her everything
while wiping her tears.

130
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:14,179
Where to bring him, how?

131
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,481
And yes, he should be alone.

132
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,948
We've been going around in circles.

133
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,551
Was it the one we just passed by?

134
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,991
How would a factory
look in such a small space?

135
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,195
Rudy's giving us a big contract.

136
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,956
He wants us to see the land.

137
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,325
But you've no patience.

138
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,194
It's not about patience.

139
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,702
We're no longer in Rudy's area.

140
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,831
And this is Aditya
Pratap Singh's area.

141
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,772
Yes, so what? They're friends.

142
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:39,934
Maybe they're planning
something together.

143
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,473
Be quiet.

144
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,836
No need to fear anyone.

145
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,598
Except me.

146
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,307
Inform the police 15 minutes later.

147
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,343
Send 50,000 to the police station.

148
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:25,581
Yes.

149
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:48,442
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!

150
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:53,347
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!

151
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,784
Let's get out of here.

152
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,388
Yes. - Sir, the police
have arrested my son-in-law.

153
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:03,324
They arrested him for stealing.
- Call from the CM's office.

154
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,326
Say that I will call him later.

155
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,556
And, Kanhaiyya, call the SP?

156
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:11,760
The irrigation process between
Satpalgaj to Mejha is stalled.

157
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,793
The budget's been sanctioned.

158
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,929
But ma'am hasn't signed it yet.

159
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,831
Leave the file here.
Collect it in the evening.

160
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,342
And, take me to Choti Rani,
I want to talk to her.

161
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,439
Yes.

162
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,819
Rudy. I'll see you
in 10 minutes. - Okay.

163
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,886
Choti Rani!

164
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,758
Madhvi.

165
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,630
Madhvi!

166
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:08,821
Madhvi!

167
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:17,959
You!

168
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,803
When did you arrive?

169
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,902
You're not well.

170
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,767
I am absolutely fine.

171
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,968
First, go wear something decent.

172
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,447
I've forsaken all
decency in front of you.

173
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,249
So, why this formality?

174
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,184
You call me by my name now.

175
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:47,496
Earlier, you would say
'Choti Rani' so romantically.

176
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,892
Let me warn you. - Yes.

177
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,699
Don't try to seduce me.

178
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,463
I won't fall for that again.

179
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,538
And you don't look
nice doing all this.

180
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,608
I feel like paying for it.

181
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,809
Fine, pay me.
That will make me happy.

182
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:11,410
You've become so cheap.

183
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,621
I don't have loose
change to spare for you...

184
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,823
You're the local MLA.

185
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,292
I'm leaving this file behind.

186
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,591
Sign them when you're
back to your senses.

187
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:25,934
Kanhaiyya.

188
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,360
Saheb. I need some money...

189
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:28,961
Kan haiyya.

190
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,332
I've spent it all.

191
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,931
Saheb. Saheb, please.

192
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,533
Saheb, I really need money.

193
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,350
Come on, move your hands faster.

194
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,287
It'll start raining any moment.

195
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,296
Bunny uncle's sent an invitation.

196
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:54,823
Polo Match.

197
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,457
Will you go?

198
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,459
No.

199
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,794
He didn't reply to my proposal.

200
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,964
No need to go.

201
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,633
I wouldn't have if you hadn't
shown me Ranjana's picture.

202
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:08,704
We'll go.

203
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,573
We will all go.

204
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,614
We've to win this match.

205
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,790
Greetings, Her Highness.

206
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,354
Hello, Her Highness.

207
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:27,630
Polo match?

208
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,728
Looking for a groom for Rachna?

209
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,997
You know everything that
goes around in this kingdom.

210
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,463
I'll come to you when
I start looking for one.

211
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,972
How are you, Madhvi?
- Very well, uncle.

212
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,403
Is Vishi back from Dubai?

213
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,274
He'll be here soon.

214
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,903
Maybe his flight is delayed.

215
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,544
Welcome.

216
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,248
Hi Aditya.

217
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,663
Did you forget about my proposal...

218
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,958
or, you didn't
think it was important?

219
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,330
Let's go inside and talk.

220
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,562
People are eagerly waiting for you.

221
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,000
Hello, Sheena, how are you? - Hello?

222
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:13,942
How are you?

223
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,872
I'm fine, how about you?

224
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,336
Yeah.

225
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,779
Hi.

226
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,941
Hello, Ranjana. - Hello.

227
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:22,879
How are you?
- I'm fine, how about you?

228
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,351
So, what're you up to these days?

229
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:25,854
Looking nice. - You too.

230
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,355
Thank you.

231
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,556
Cheers.

232
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:36,494
Hello.

233
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,397
Sir's busy in a meeting.

234
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,696
He'll call you back later.

235
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,895
Yes, sir.

236
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,671
Didn't you take
a bullet in the chest?

237
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:51,839
Your master survived as well.

238
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,050
Yes. - How?

239
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:01,488
Those who speak less, live longer.

240
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:06,618
So you think by doing
this we'll be richer.

241
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,288
You can consider that.

242
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,560
With four different states,
we'll receive more funds.

243
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:12,691
More development.

244
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,397
But, you will still be
in power in all the four states.

245
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:16,996
You will benefit
from the development.

246
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:20,605
I... am not in favor
of dividing Uttar Pradesh.

247
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:24,374
This can be your personal view,
but the other MLA's...

248
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:25,812
That's them.

249
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:27,646
Ask them.

250
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,975
Listen. Where did they come from?

251
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,846
They are sitting there.

252
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,518
I see. - Yes.

253
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,350
I see.

254
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,585
Hello, Virender Singh.

255
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:42,927
Look, I must know the
number of MLA's supporting us.

256
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,695
Only after that,
will I bring this up in the assembly.

257
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,839
Mr. Tiwari. -Yes.

258
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:56,707
We'll discuss this
personally and let you know.

259
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,279
Fine. But, hurry up.

260
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,942
Because the CM's facing
a lot of pressure.

261
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,709
And, please control him.

262
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,483
Every issue is a
matter of pride for him.

263
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,580
We'll let you know soon.

264
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,818
What happened?

265
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,792
I'm certainly losing this election.

266
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:14,386
Because there's been
no development in my area.

267
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,226
And now, no one will
vote you for who you are.

268
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,626
And now, we're running independently.

269
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,226
Where will the funds come from?

270
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:22,728
Quiet!

271
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:25,831
People address us as 'Rajaji' (king).

272
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,743
If we separate, we'll lose power.

273
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,405
We'll have to join his party and
then, I'll be called a politician.

274
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,483
It's not music to my ears.

275
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,852
There are other
ways to collect funds.

276
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,719
Let's discuss this later.

277
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,551
It's time.

278
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,389
The horses must be getting restless.

279
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,329
Come on.

280
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:49,622
Let's move.

281
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:50,825
Let's go.

282
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,696
Bunny uncle.

283
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,429
We need to talk.

284
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:56,804
Don't worry.

285
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:58,467
It's a different issue.

286
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,668
Is it true? - One moment.

287
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,375
Is everything okay? -Yes thank you.

288
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:15,657
What were you doing?

289
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:16,949
We've guests over.

290
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,558
I was with them.

291
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,357
Yes, I saw them coming.

292
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,196
They didn't look royal to me.

293
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:26,362
They look more like
government officials.

294
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:31,536
They've lost what we still maintain.

295
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,673
Do you get it?

296
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,340
They can't ride a horse?

297
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,971
What do you want to say?

298
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:41,246
Are they discussing your marriage?

299
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,347
Not that I heard of.

300
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,680
You want to marry Ranjana.

301
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,485
H ow?

302
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,921
Okay, you might start
walking in a year or two.

303
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,862
But you're a married man.

304
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:57,629
Bunny uncle,
you sound like a democratic.

305
00:25:58,356 --> 00:25:59,699
I am a king!

306
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,303
I can afford an extra wife.

307
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,303
And I don't need any
government fund for that.

308
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,468
I heard that Aditya
Pratap Singh's here too.

309
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,370
Yes.

310
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,471
How does he look?

311
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,182
They all look the
same on a wheelchair.

312
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,185
Helpless.

313
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,385
He took a bullet, but survived.

314
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:26,557
I know.

315
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,495
Do you know why he survived?

316
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,532
He has to die by my hands.

317
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,375
It's not possible. - Only if you try.

318
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,343
And you can.

319
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,872
You're a king, so am I.

320
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:50,819
But your blood's cooled down,
not mine.

321
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,649
Hello.

322
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:55,717
Yes, son.

323
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:57,852
What?

324
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,684
Who... who's with you?

325
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,885
Pardon me, Your Highness.
But, master wants to speak.

326
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:05,653
Don't you see I'm
speaking over the phone.

327
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,854
It's important.

328
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,354
This is just as much important.

329
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,429
Call from Dubai?

330
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:19,405
I heard that your son Vishi
was caught red-handed with drugs.

331
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,709
They've strict laws.

332
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,848
And drugs is a serious of fence.

333
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:32,487
You're such a lowly man.

334
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,749
If I can get your son in
trouble in Dubai from here...

335
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:40,853
then your home's
just 300 kilometers away.

336
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:46,625
I can get Ranjana abducted.

337
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:51,839
Many kings have abducted
their brides in the past.

338
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,875
We don't call them lowly but gallant.

339
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:02,751
A few affluent Sheiks in
Dubai studied with me in London.

340
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,243
We're good friends.

341
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,581
Come down to my place with the token.

342
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,784
I'll keep Ranjana happy.

343
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:27,674
You have forgotten our
relationship by mistake.

344
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,303
Didn't you think it
necessary to keep it in mind?

345
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:37,183
If I can get your son in
trouble in Dubai from here...

346
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:41,280
then your home's
just 300 kilometers away.

347
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:54,494
Father, did you just fire a bullet?

348
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,902
Yes. I did.

349
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,241
But why?

350
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,641
I wanted to kill myself.

351
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,677
But then, I thought about you.

352
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:10,015
Sit.

353
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,389
That's fate.

354
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,424
Sure you got a job,
but where did you get transferred?

355
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:19,654
Do you get me?

356
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,389
Listen.

357
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:25,026
God's trying to say something to you.

358
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,398
Here, talk to brother.

359
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,771
Yes, Param. When are you joining?

360
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,469
Speak slowly.

361
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,744
No, I could send...
- Yes, Your Highness.

362
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,409
I'll send your stuff over.

363
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,810
You mean, I am more like security.

364
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,414
If you hand me over,
brother will be set free.

365
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,354
We've been humiliated, dear.

366
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,726
Aditya Pratap Singh has mortified us.

367
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:54,294
I am retaliating.

368
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,588
And you are my weapon.

369
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:58,799
That doesn't make sense.

370
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,891
What can I possibly do?

371
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,402
I am not sending you alone.

372
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,665
Your Highness,
lnderjeet Singh's here.

373
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,568
Send him in.

374
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,312
Your Highness.

375
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,217
You played well today.

376
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,444
Three of our riders were tired...

377
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,020
otherwise,
I would have scored two more goals.

378
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,311
And then...

379
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,321
Why did you hit the
ball towards Aditya Singh?

380
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,457
It was a mistake.

381
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,892
I wanted to turn,
but the horse didn't...

382
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,895
so the shot went straight.

383
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,361
You did the right thing.

384
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,798
What?

385
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:40,837
I know that wasn't a mistake.

386
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,434
You were trying to fuel the war...

387
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,809
your grandfather lost
to Aditya Singh's family.

388
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:49,012
You were just inflaming that.

389
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,821
It was a mistake, Your Highness.

390
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,285
I couldn't control myself.

391
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,057
Aditya Singh wants to marry Ranjana.

392
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,350
When I refused...

393
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,691
he got my son arrested
for drugs in Dubai,

394
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,661
I'm giving my approval
for the engagement.

395
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:07,863
But... I want Aditya
Singh dead before the wedding.

396
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:11,497
The government wants
to finish his power.

397
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,532
And I want his honor...

398
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,680
You can take his life,
if you're interested.

399
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:21,844
Look.

400
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,687
Channel your anger properly.

401
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:29,786
Kings don't look
nice out on the streets.

402
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,724
Please listen to me...

403
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:34,763
I just don't understand.
This doesn't feel right.

404
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:35,922
Your Highness.

405
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:40,332
I can end my war by
taking Aditya Singh's life.

406
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:45,567
But, finishing his power
and honor will take time.

407
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:51,610
And, after that's done,
I would like to marry Ranjana.

408
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:53,772
Trying to take advantage?

409
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,011
That means,
I will have to fight with you next.

410
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,718
I accept.

411
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:33,346
You want this war, don't you?

412
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:34,944
So be it.

413
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,745
And it'll be a fierce one.

414
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,218
Swear on you.

415
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,776
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

416
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,507
Come with me. Ratan.

417
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,243
Yes, Her Highness.
- What are you doing?

418
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,877
See whether the red lamp's
been lit or not. Okay?

419
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:14,650
Light-up all the lamps.

420
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:16,452
Hurry up, and I want this polished...

421
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,595
Listen. What's going on here?

422
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,493
The master has thrown a party...

423
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,859
Go.

424
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:57,463
I hope you didn't have
a problem finding the place.

425
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,000
No, not at all.

426
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:07,369
We saw a polo match
after a long time.

427
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,705
Greetings.

428
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:10,544
Hello.

429
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:11,978
Hello, Madhvi.

430
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,342
I didn't know Saheb's thrown a party.

431
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,645
He didn't tell you? - No.

432
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:21,314
No one tells me anything these days.

433
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,660
You don't talk to me either.

434
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,230
We would if you stay in your senses.

435
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,726
Don't create a scene today, Madhvi.

436
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:33,733
Why?

437
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,205
Anything special?

438
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,417
Your presence here is supporting.

439
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,694
You know I was against it.

440
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:07,522
Glittering dreams.

441
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:11,730
Beautiful dreams.

442
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,632
Glittering dreams.

443
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:19,432
Beautiful dreams.

444
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:23,510
But... if you wake up...

445
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:27,511
Dreams shatter like glass... Hey.

446
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:31,311
Some fall here, some there.

447
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:35,215
Hey.

448
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,457
Some fall here, some there.

449
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:43,791
Hey.

450
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:01,906
Careful with that platter.

451
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:05,685
The drink's untouched.

452
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:09,884
Don't let it slip.

453
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,727
Or it's no good.

454
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,231
All those dreams in your eyes.

455
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,890
Will spill over.

456
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,192
All those dreams in your eyes.

457
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,531
Will spill over.

458
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:25,402
Some which got spilt over..

459
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:29,236
Some magical dreams.

460
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:33,342
Some fall here, some there.

461
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:37,346
Hey.

462
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:41,418
Some fall here, some there.

463
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:45,889
Hey.

464
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:15,281
Love's divided here...
like a deck of cards.

465
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:23,494
If you win the game, you get lucky.

466
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:27,702
These mischievous dreams
are just an illusion.

467
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:31,035
These mischievous
dreams are an illusion.

468
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:38,713
If you let dust gather on it,
it's worth nothing.

469
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:42,740
Some fall here, some there.

470
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,352
Hey.

471
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,850
Glittering dreams.

472
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:55,355
Beautiful dreams.

473
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,767
Glittering dreams.

474
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,862
Beautiful dreams.

475
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,990
Goodnight, Aditya, love you.

476
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,351
Bye, Rudy. Bye-

477
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,632
When will Vishi return?

478
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,738
He'll be back in a day or two.

479
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,374
All this is against everyone's will.

480
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:43,567
Forsake your anger.

481
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,374
It's the beginning of a new relation.

482
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:46,914
I'm not uttering a word.

483
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,844
You asked Ranjana to stay back.

484
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:51,542
Did I say a word?

485
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,847
The only reason I asked
Ranjana to stay back...

486
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:56,686
is so that she could
understand me, know me better.

487
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,554
If she stays here...

488
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:59,491
What will the people
say if she stays here?

489
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,290
I want her to see her defamed.

490
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:05,294
So that anyone thinks twice
before sending a proposal.

491
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:23,234
Come closer, because
this moment won't come again.

492
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:33,886
Take me in your arms,
and let those tears fall.

493
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:40,613
Wonder if love will
ever dwell in these eyes.

494
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:51,890
We might not meet
again in this lifetime.

495
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:02,213
Hold me close...

496
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,547
Stop that music!

497
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:08,918
This night may...

498
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:26,338
Glory to... - Madhvi ma'am!

499
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:32,813
Glory to... - 'Choti Rani'!

500
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:43,517
Did you sleep properly?

501
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,320
Yes.

502
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:50,889
I know you like photography.

503
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:53,767
What else do you like?

504
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:57,497
Why don't you tell me
about your likes and dislikes?

505
00:44:57,928 --> 00:44:59,566
I'll keep it in mind.

506
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:02,341
My likes and dislikes
are not the law here.

507
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:03,707
Seems like that.

508
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:06,939
If I make a mistake,
I'll be punished.

509
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,706
Don't say that.

510
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,978
I fell in love with your picture.

511
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:19,454
Remember,
I'll just be an image for you.

512
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,890
I won't make a mistake.

513
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:29,432
I will keep trying...
to bring you to life.

514
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:32,702
Remember.

515
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:35,002
The day I get up from this chair...

516
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,635
I'll marry you.

517
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:47,583
Greetings.

518
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:53,420
Greetings.

519
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,499
I get it.

520
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,438
I'll call you later.

521
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,508
How's everything?
- Everything's fine.

522
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,551
No problem at all.

523
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:18,779
It's all your grace.

524
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:21,618
I meant our area.

525
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,416
There's prosperity in our area.

526
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:25,653
Everyone's happy.

527
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:29,396
What do you do?

528
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:31,625
I am the PA to His Highness.

529
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:33,334
His Highness?

530
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,559
I mean, your PA.

531
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,536
What are his appointments for today?

532
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:42,442
Nothing important.

533
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,341
I can see there's nothing
special going on here.

534
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:46,979
People are simply loathing around.

535
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:48,238
Loathing.

536
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:50,443
Where's the money?

537
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,949
Where does he keep the money?

538
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:53,487
Money?

539
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:58,222
Madam.

540
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,251
There's no money here.

541
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:01,828
Only sir keeps them.

542
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,467
I need some money.

543
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:11,700
Madam... I've some money.

544
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:13,739
I'll take them from sir later.

545
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:23,376
How far is Jagdishpur?

546
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:50,904
How long will you keep
up with this hunger strike?

547
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,403
Greetings, Her Highness.

548
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,311
Until our last breath.

549
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:55,644
Come, sit.

550
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,717
How can they mow down
our fields and build a highway?

551
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,756
That will change the entire
geography of the village.

552
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,956
Her Highness,
what are you doing here?

553
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,559
What brings you here?

554
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:11,929
It's a hunger-strike,
I thought I should pay you a visit.

555
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,502
If I don't, who else will?

556
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:21,473
Our battle is with
the central government.

557
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,772
It's not your fault.

558
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:25,470
And, it's not in your power.

559
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,980
So, what can you do?

560
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:30,480
I know it's not within my power.

561
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,551
But your grief's intolerable.

562
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:41,526
Who's drinking?

563
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:45,395
Umesh, you?

564
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:46,900
Everyone's here on a hunger-strike...

565
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,333
and you're drunk.

566
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,735
This is an agitation,
tie him up to the tree.

567
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,005
Rascal.

568
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,503
Let me know if you need anything.

569
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,374
We need a lot of things,
Her Highness.

570
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:03,317
I'll leave.

571
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,887
I'll send you some help.

572
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:12,619
Who is that?

573
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,590
Hello, Madhvi.

574
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:17,825
I hail from this area.

575
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,400
I'm returning after
a number of years.

576
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:22,493
So, I want to make an investment.

577
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:24,805
Nothing special. I just
want to do something for my land.

578
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:26,602
Is he the new collector?

579
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,870
I'm not expecting profits,
just a big name for myself.

580
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,712
First tell me your name...

581
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:34,178
"then I'll tell you
a way to make it big.

582
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:35,375
Inder.

583
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:37,347
Inderjeet Singh...

584
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,390
You take your name with pride.

585
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:48,396
What can I do for you, Mr...
lnderjeet Singh.

586
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:52,697
Just your support,
and soon you'll feel proud too.

587
00:49:56,293 --> 00:50:00,264
Why do I get always get men?

588
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,535
Why not poets?

589
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:08,476
I will learn, gradually.
In your company.

590
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:14,252
You don't make a poet.

591
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:16,515
They're born.

592
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:23,321
You love someone.

593
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,762
You never love someone.

594
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,937
One always falls in love.

595
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:32,935
And it shows.

596
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:34,469
Leave that.

597
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:35,937
What do you want?

598
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,636
I'll be right back.

599
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:51,652
This is a donation for your party.

600
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:57,557
I won independently.

601
00:50:57,754 --> 00:51:01,861
I have no party. - Yes.

602
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:10,267
It's our first meeting,
I can't be too brazen.

603
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:29,430
Keep up the hunger-strike.

604
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:30,554
We'll keep up this hunger-strike.

605
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:32,429
Don't give up. - Never.

606
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,660
Glory to... - Madhvi ma'am!

607
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,829
Glory to... - 'Choti Rani'!

608
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:50,609
Let's form a party then.

609
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:52,948
You're now my treasurer.

610
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,347
A man, poet and a treasurer.

611
00:51:57,247 --> 00:51:59,591
I need all three to look after me.

612
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:01,621
Do you have a card?

613
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:05,294
It's under print.

614
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,310
You try.

615
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:21,876
Guns don't interest me.

616
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,251
I'm not interested in guns either.

617
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:29,287
It's a necessity to stay alive.

618
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:38,923
I've... taken up photography.
Like you.

619
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,964
Pick up the gun.

620
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,399
Here you go.

621
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,274
Take this.22.

622
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:52,674
It's a one of the best rifles.

623
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:54,947
Take it,
Vishi will be set free tomorrow.

624
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:18,638
You won't applaud, right?

625
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:21,276
Because, I might like it.

626
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:22,636
Right.

627
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,642
Hand me that gun. Come on.

628
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,373
Looking at your condition...

629
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:32,544
its best to keep
this gun away from you.

630
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:39,451
You don't always need
a gun to kill someone.

631
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:41,591
Just like you took mine.

632
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,320
No bullets fired.

633
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:45,932
No accusations. Right?

634
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,331
How do you like it here?

635
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,003
Feels nice.

636
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:57,535
You're getting used to this place.

637
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:00,779
It's been just two days
and you're already lying.

638
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,178
Madhvi!

639
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:04,947
Sorry.

640
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,522
What's wrong, Sunder? - Sir...

641
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,614
Yes, dear. I know.

642
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:40,986
It's a mad house.

643
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:43,224
But I feel bad for Madhvi.

644
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:44,650
I think she needs a doctor.

645
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:47,524
That woman is very smart.

646
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,988
Inder met her today.

647
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:54,531
He charmed her and
she was more than willing.

648
00:54:55,425 --> 00:55:00,033
She said You can be my treasurer.

649
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,903
Father, I'll talk to you later.

650
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:03,838
Okay, dear. No problem.

651
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:23,330
Do you have a license for this gun?

652
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,826
What the...

653
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:26,229
Look at you.

654
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:28,999
Something's still missing.

655
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,371
You're just...
Greetings. - Okay, okay.

656
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:35,007
I'm new on this job.
Give me some time.

657
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:36,403
Soon, I'll look fitting.

658
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,807
He's joined the police force.

659
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:40,404
And do you know where
he's been posted?

660
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:41,646
Here.

661
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:43,445
That's been bothering me as well.

662
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,520
I mean, out of all the places in UP.

663
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,549
It's such a big coincidence,
Your Highness.

664
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:51,555
This isn't fluke,
someone's pulling the strings.

665
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:54,559
We aren't fighting without a reason.

666
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:56,889
We're building an army.

667
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,219
You need to check these files.

668
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:24,383
Requests from irrigation,
forest and PWD departments.

669
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:36,498
Greetings, madam.

670
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:42,741
It's nice to see you here.

671
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,742
There's a lawyer, Madhukar Asthana.

672
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:46,606
He's filed a PIL against the DM...

673
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:48,910
regarding the road construction.

674
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,277
He's really troubled.

675
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:54,418
And wants your help.

676
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:58,322
What's... a PIL?

677
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,459
Sir.

678
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:05,924
Greetings, sir.

679
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:07,399
Yes.

680
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:09,360
He wants to speak to you.

681
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,336
Yes.

682
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,931
Suddenly, you just realized
your responsibilities.

683
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,501
Good.

684
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:17,572
You know how to sign.

685
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,838
Just sign where I tell you to.

686
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:24,211
If you need some money
take it from Sunder.

687
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:27,413
Sir has sent some money.

688
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:31,617
I don't need it.

689
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:34,285
Sir... -You can go.

690
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:37,225
Go.

691
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:50,003
Does the car run smoothly?
- Yes, sir. It does.

692
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:52,003
Kanta. - Yes, Your Highness.

693
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:54,680
The shrubs have outgrown.
Get them trimmed.

694
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:57,375
Your Highness, I'll get
some clothes stitched. - Yes.

695
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,545
Ranjana has sent some designs,
they're just right.

696
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:02,623
No need to ask me for everything.

697
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:05,654
It's your money,
I'll have to keep an account.

698
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,453
I'll deduct it. -What?

699
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,323
Deduct? How?

700
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:10,955
From your dowry.

701
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:14,530
Yes, that's right.

702
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:16,761
Madhvi's calling.

703
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:23,404
I think she needs you.

704
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:26,872
Keep your clothes on.

705
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:29,245
She's takes them off.

706
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:31,916
If your clothes come off...

707
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:34,888
you'll never be
able to repay my debt.

708
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:40,186
No, Your Highness.

709
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:42,388
I'm not that weak.

710
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:45,957
Focus on the issue. - Yes.

711
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:48,461
That's the only weakness
we kings have...

712
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:50,398
which turns into our defeat.

713
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:52,734
Right? - Yes, that's true.

714
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:14,924
It's lnder.

715
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:17,329
You called? - Yes.

716
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:21,394
Hello - I...

717
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:24,701
Hello.

718
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:28,340
I... need help. - Help for what?

719
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:36,211
I want to learn politics.

720
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:41,454
I want to learn politics.

721
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:48,394
Madhvi, just like poets are born,
so are politicians.

722
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:50,824
Why do you want to
learn such a vile thing?

723
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:56,302
Just maintain your decree,
I will handle the politics.

724
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:57,268
Okay?

725
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:06,304
Hello, Mr. Tiwari - Hello.

726
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:08,371
Good morning, sir.

727
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:23,694
Sir, there's a letter
from the Ministry.

728
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:29,226
And, there's another letter...

729
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:30,870
Yes.

730
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:33,503
Sir, the Collector
from Mejha is here.

731
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,710
And ajournalist from the Indian Age.

732
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,607
Indian Age? - Yes, sir.

733
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:39,536
Send him in. -Yes, sir.

734
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,445
Listen. -Yes, sir.

735
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:44,040
Is it a man or a woman?

736
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:46,877
It's a man. - I see.

737
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:48,916
Fine, send him in.

738
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:51,551
Sir, your signatures... - Go out.

739
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:20,416
Good morning, sir. - Good morning.

740
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,512
Please close the door.

741
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:24,022
I see.

742
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,760
I am lndrajeet Singh,
from the Indian Age. - Okay.

743
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,926
We're starting a new column.

744
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:38,033
We'll be publishing the profiles...

745
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:39,602
of the top five
politicians of the state.

746
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:40,833
Profile?

747
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,407
Please take a seat.

748
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:44,603
Look, everyone publishes
about their work.

749
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:46,405
How's the personality?

750
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:48,345
Personality! How is it?

751
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:51,518
I mean, Prabhu Tiwari
as a person is...

752
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:52,947
He's nice.

753
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:55,283
So, shall we start? - Yes, please.

754
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:56,719
Ready?

755
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:57,917
No problem.

756
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:05,490
Are you sensitive? - What?

757
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:10,637
I mean feelings, emotions?
- Sensitive?

758
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:11,933
Sensitive.

759
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:15,966
Yes. I am a sensitive man.

760
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:22,906
So, what is Prabhu Tiwari?

761
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:29,247
Suppose, we need to describe
him in one word. -Yeah.

762
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:30,958
So what example will you give?

763
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:35,488
An honest man.

764
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,758
No, no human.
Compare yourself to something.

765
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:41,935
Something like Prabhu
Tiwari is like water. - Yeah.

766
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:43,833
Calm.

767
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,866
Or he's like fire.

768
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:47,032
Or like a cycle.

769
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:48,468
Cycle?

770
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,472
It keeps running without fuel.

771
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:52,045
More output, less expensive.

772
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:56,849
Then Prabhu Tiwari... is an ox!

773
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:59,977
Ox? - A hard working ox!

774
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:03,849
Ox!

775
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,955
That can have other meanings, sir.

776
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:09,485
What?

777
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:11,296
You're not smart.

778
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,524
Then forget it.

779
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:14,862
Your next question please.

780
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,631
Allow me... - Just delete it.

781
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:20,401
Say that you're a tomato. - Tomato?

782
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:21,839
It looks nice.

783
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:25,276
Use it in pickles,
or in food, eat it raw, it's healthy.

784
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:26,472
Everyone eats it.

785
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:30,950
It does have a lot of variety?
- Yes. Of course.

786
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:32,811
Mr. lnder, excuse me.

787
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:34,855
That makes two. - Two tomatoes?

788
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:38,391
No. One is sensitive.

789
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:41,660
And the second is tomato.

790
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:43,594
Yes, right. Okay.

791
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,723
This is lndrajeet speaking, and...

792
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,731
Prabhu Tiwari is a very,
very sensitive tomato...

793
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:51,966
So, sir. Do you like reading?

794
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:53,229
Reading? - Yes.

795
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,003
I like reading a lot.

796
01:03:56,966 --> 01:04:00,243
In fact...
I've read more autobiographies.

797
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,748
Pundit Nehru. Gandhiji.

798
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,342
What are human values? - What?

799
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,454
Human values. - I see.

800
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:09,989
You know, human.

801
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:13,454
First, know the people...

802
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:15,187
then become their leader.

803
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:18,432
You can dream about
the moon later...

804
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,728
first learn to live on earth.

805
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:21,824
Wow.

806
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:24,530
Just a second. Let me write it down.

807
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:27,702
I always write these things down.

808
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:33,839
Excuse me.

809
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:39,512
The laptop...

810
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:41,781
What... is it? - Please don't bother,
please, please.

811
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,552
The door's opened too.

812
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:50,555
Ramcharan!

813
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,459
Do you know how to turn this off,
Mr. lnder?

814
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,730
I'll try. - Please. Please.

815
01:04:56,826 --> 01:04:57,896
Who touched my laptop?

816
01:04:57,994 --> 01:05:00,941
Who touched my laptop?
- Just a minute.

817
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:14,686
Mr. lnder,
you've seen such a vile thing...

818
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:15,949
But, please don't
forget to mention...

819
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:18,453
that I am a honest man.

820
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:23,855
Would... you...
like a cold drink? - Yes...

821
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:25,454
Let it be. - No...

822
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:26,726
Let it be. - Pande...

823
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:27,823
Sir, don't bother.

824
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,562
Send two cold drinks...
- Let it be...

825
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:31,535
Immediately!

826
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,366
That's not done.

827
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:36,935
What other hobbies do you like?

828
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:40,004
Nothing much.

829
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:41,679
Do you every cry?

830
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:46,216
It's my... humble request.

831
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:48,448
Don't mention these things, please.

832
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:49,887
It's not for the interview.

833
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:51,981
I meant,
bad days are around the corner.

834
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:53,750
I've heard that the
Chief Minister's changing.

835
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:56,656
He's facing difficulties
dividing the states.

836
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:58,993
Who told you that?

837
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,166
The CM's not being changed.

838
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:03,463
Those four MLAs, the four kings.

839
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,204
They aren't agreeing.

840
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:08,333
Aditya Pratap Singh's stopping them.

841
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,508
You seem to have
a lot of information.

842
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:11,734
How do you know?

843
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:13,914
I am a reporter, sir. Journalist.

844
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:17,174
I know in which direction
the wind is blowing, and how?

845
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:18,616
Tell me something else.

846
01:06:22,244 --> 01:06:23,951
How about I fix
a meeting with Madhvi?

847
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:26,352
What good will that do?

848
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:27,989
We need Saheb's approval.

849
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,457
Madhvi doesn't listen to Saheb now.

850
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,466
I will make Madhvi join your party...

851
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:35,661
and you give her some small post.

852
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:38,895
Something like a Welfare program.

853
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:42,437
Mr. lndrajeet. -Yes.

854
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:47,875
Did you play this adult film?

855
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,452
Independent MLA candidate
Madhvi Singh from Devgarh...

856
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:06,261
was appointed President
of 'Women's Welfare Program'.

857
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:37,864
It's just cheat, lies and deceit.

858
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:42,358
It's a place for selfishness.
- I take your leave.

859
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:45,337
I only compromised for Ranjana.

860
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:46,899
That's all.

861
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,535
Revenge is bloody.

862
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:53,307
Greed, desires, lust, anger.

863
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:56,907
Revenge is bloody.

864
01:07:57,006 --> 01:08:00,647
Greed, desires, lust, anger.

865
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:04,324
Every culprit's innocent.

866
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:07,417
There's anger in love.

867
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:11,629
Even the dead are restless.

868
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:15,463
Jealousy's your only strength.

869
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:41,488
Who was he?

870
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:43,530
The Prince of Jagdalpur.

871
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:47,325
I have just barged in.
Lam climbing up your stairs.

872
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,463
The colours of the walls are fine.

873
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:55,564
We'll need some curtains.

874
01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:57,268
Yes, change them.

875
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:55,498
Princess?

876
01:09:57,726 --> 01:09:59,672
Your fragrance...

877
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:03,705
How are you?

878
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:09,348
Just...

879
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,783
Can't sleep.

880
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:17,923
Let me help you.

881
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:31,730
How does this open?

882
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:39,474
Where does it open from?

883
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:42,942
Take a look.

884
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:58,358
Will I have to tear it? - No.

885
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:24,548
Hold on for five seconds,
you can do it, sir.

886
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:27,618
Bravo. You can do it, sir.

887
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:35,702
My father-in-law's father.

888
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:38,861
Back in those days he
owned an air-strip. - Okay.

889
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,634
Two planes. - Right.

890
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,538
He never got along with the British.

891
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:44,938
But he completed his
entire education in England.

892
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:46,411
Wonderful.

893
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:49,348
This is our ancestral sword. - Wow!

894
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:50,745
Hemangi. - Yes.

895
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:52,646
Come on.

896
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:57,353
Ma'am, tell us something
about your cuisine.

897
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:00,989
How was it before
and what is the change?

898
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:03,225
Back then we had a lot of people.

899
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,458
We always had some guest over.

900
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:08,362
Parties. Servants and maids.

901
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:12,361
Today, we cook as much
as any normal family.

902
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,468
But, there are few
recipes we still make.

903
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:17,476
Excuse me.

904
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:20,240
Good afternoon, Your Highness.

905
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:21,880
I want you to leave.

906
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:24,545
This... this won't take
more than half an hour, sir.

907
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,745
Seriously. Come on.

908
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:29,856
Hey you, camera. Please.

909
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:33,256
They're just asking normal questions,
nothing political.

910
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:34,293
What were you showing them?

911
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:35,361
What we were...

912
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:36,953
There are just a handful of us.

913
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:40,694
Take a picture,
we might go extinct someday.

914
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:45,632
We're still alive.
We haven't perished away.

915
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:48,470
We've a history.

916
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:50,703
And we'll keep making history.

917
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,912
This is my home, not a bloody museum!

918
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:26,969
Take your gun out.

919
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:29,211
Here?

920
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:31,374
We'll venerate him.

921
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:38,324
Cap.

922
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:55,305
No...

923
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:57,302
No, brother.

924
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:59,743
You've already anointed
him with your blood.

925
01:13:59,868 --> 01:14:01,506
There's no need for this.
- Look here.

926
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:03,942
Grandpa's watching.

927
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:04,980
You already...

928
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,583
It'll hurt...

929
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:07,880
What are you doing, Param?

930
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:09,387
Just a small one.

931
01:14:09,478 --> 01:14:11,924
It's hurting...
- Grandpa's asking for sacrifice.

932
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:13,726
It's hurting. - Let go.

933
01:14:13,849 --> 01:14:15,692
Slowly. Slowly!

934
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:54,732
Chetia. Chetia. Chetia.

935
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:55,927
Call for you.

936
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:57,731
Hello.

937
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:04,536
UP 17 X 3851.

938
01:15:28,757 --> 01:15:29,827
Get down.

939
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:38,703
Get back.

940
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,877
Hold him. Hold him.

941
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,541
Bullets.

942
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:47,314
Hold him. Hold him.

943
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:48,477
They were in my pockets.

944
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:49,885
Found it.

945
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:56,394
Got him! - I hit him first.

946
01:15:57,753 --> 01:15:59,323
Brother!

947
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:01,933
The pain!

948
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:07,340
That's not him.

949
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:08,499
It's not him.

950
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:11,266
He's not the one in Ranjana's photo.

951
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,640
How can that be?

952
01:16:15,537 --> 01:16:17,676
Madhvi's going with you. - Yes.

953
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,911
Mr. Saxena is royal blood.

954
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,289
His father was the Principal
Secretary, Madhya Pradesh.

955
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:25,414
Yes.

956
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:27,653
Often money's not their weakness.

957
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:36,867
Return it to her. - Yes.

958
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:40,600
The highway's become
dangerous these days. - Yes.

959
01:16:40,696 --> 01:16:42,539
You carry a weapon, too. Show me.

960
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:46,238
I do, but never use it.

961
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:47,511
Here.

962
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,844
Hand it here, Mr. Jaiswal. - Here.

963
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:53,613
This can take your life,
don't treat it like a bride.

964
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:56,383
Where you seduce her for two hours,
and the rest in two minutes.

965
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:59,220
This is how you use it...

966
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:03,429
Careful, the bride will die.

967
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:06,463
Sit down.

968
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:07,556
Sit here.

969
01:17:08,256 --> 01:17:11,430
Ranjana says she's going back. - Yes.

970
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:13,164
She's bored here.

971
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:15,468
She has read all the all the books...
- Please leave.

972
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:17,399
You will be late for the meeting.

973
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:19,479
I am travelling out of the city.

974
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:21,878
If I could have my gun back.

975
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,250
I was about to give it back.

976
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,849
No need to be scared now.

977
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:32,516
I'm always scared.

978
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:35,458
What if the gun
turns brazen like you?

979
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:40,692
And fires on anyone, anywhere.

980
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:43,700
Please excuse me,
I'm waiting outside.

981
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:47,872
Now you humiliate me
in front of strangers as well.

982
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:52,869
Every time I look at you,
I feel like misbehaving.

983
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:58,308
Don't talk too much in the meeting,

984
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,283
Just smile a few times.

985
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:03,681
And no drinking.

986
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:07,527
Master, Vasanfs here.

987
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:14,662
Don't treat her like
that in my presence.

988
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:18,237
I didn't say all that to please you.

989
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:21,935
Do you know why men
use more abusive language?

990
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:25,411
Because they don't cry much.

991
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:29,177
I'll be back in awhile.

992
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,192
Stay quiet.

993
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:40,750
Saheb.

994
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,358
They killed four of our men.

995
01:18:47,589 --> 01:18:50,763
And Chetia's... missing.

996
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:52,533
So, why come here?

997
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:54,607
The police isn't behind this.

998
01:18:55,697 --> 01:18:58,303
Has it fired from the rifle?

999
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:01,514
It's someone else, Saheb.

1000
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:04,508
Don't come here for a few days.

1001
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:06,176
I will call you.

1002
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:08,811
And stay low, understand.

1003
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:10,151
Yes, Saheb.

1004
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:16,629
Look after yourself.

1005
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:18,454
Yes.

1006
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:31,701
Madam...

1007
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:34,645
Have you ever met the Secretary?

1008
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:37,213
No. Never.

1009
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:43,882
I've heard that he's a difficult man.

1010
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:50,557
Madam, excuse me.

1011
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:52,996
You better not drink today. Please.

1012
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:54,928
You just said he's a difficult man.

1013
01:19:55,757 --> 01:19:57,236
So, I'll have to act difficult too.

1014
01:19:57,792 --> 01:20:00,739
Mr. Jaiswal, this project
is important for the government.

1015
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:03,400
This bridge will
benefit four districts.

1016
01:20:03,498 --> 01:20:05,603
Sir, we've studied the project.

1017
01:20:06,167 --> 01:20:07,840
Now, you guide us.

1018
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:12,108
The forest department's
involved in this.

1019
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:13,709
Waterworks too.

1020
01:20:13,808 --> 01:20:17,051
They'll all give preference
to their candidates.

1021
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:18,180
There will be a tender.

1022
01:20:18,279 --> 01:20:19,485
You can fill that too.

1023
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:21,058
Madam, sugar?

1024
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,693
As much as you like.

1025
01:20:24,085 --> 01:20:25,086
What?

1026
01:20:25,186 --> 01:20:27,291
When things aren't our way...

1027
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:30,160
Then, why don't you add
sugar as much as you want.

1028
01:20:33,395 --> 01:20:35,602
Whether you get the tender or not...

1029
01:20:38,466 --> 01:20:40,639
but you will surely
get a good cup of tea.

1030
01:20:42,704 --> 01:20:45,184
I've heard a lot about you.

1031
01:20:45,673 --> 01:20:46,617
Mr. Jaiswal.

1032
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:47,709
Yes, madam.

1033
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:50,178
Will you please leave us alone?

1034
01:20:50,311 --> 01:20:51,153
Yes.

1035
01:20:51,246 --> 01:20:52,247
Okay, sir.

1036
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:06,499
Perfect.

1037
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:09,335
Shalini.

1038
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:12,339
Please go out.

1039
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:22,851
Just arrange for the money.

1040
01:21:23,111 --> 01:21:24,112
And soon.

1041
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:25,657
Consider it done.

1042
01:21:25,747 --> 01:21:28,284
I never waste time.

1043
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:30,430
Driver, let's go.

1044
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:35,093
Madam, how was the meeting?

1045
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:36,362
I've requested him.

1046
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:37,630
Let's wait and watch.

1047
01:21:37,725 --> 01:21:40,569
You've requested him,
he'll definitely say yes.

1048
01:21:41,296 --> 01:21:43,105
I've to go somewhere, alone.

1049
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:44,336
Where can I drop you?

1050
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:18,377
Drink? - Now?

1051
01:22:18,466 --> 01:22:20,309
I never drink during the day.

1052
01:22:21,769 --> 01:22:24,340
People like you give
a bad name to nights.

1053
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:28,578
I'm busy during the day.

1054
01:22:29,377 --> 01:22:31,414
So, did you do it?

1055
01:22:34,048 --> 01:22:35,550
It's done. - Done?

1056
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:37,421
You will get the tender.

1057
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:39,595
WOW!

1058
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:42,299
Thank you.

1059
01:22:42,423 --> 01:22:44,494
Thank you very much.

1060
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:47,172
Thank you.

1061
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:52,203
You look different.

1062
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:53,841
It's just...

1063
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:55,547
I got this stitched in Lucknow.

1064
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,742
I found a decent tailor in Lucknow.

1065
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:01,609
Like they say God made men,
and the tailor made gentlemen.

1066
01:23:03,311 --> 01:23:05,757
You wish to be a king too.

1067
01:23:08,449 --> 01:23:11,259
No, Madhvi, I am.

1068
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:16,599
I thought I would tell
you this on a better occasion.

1069
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:18,261
So, today is the time.

1070
01:23:18,826 --> 01:23:24,435
The ruins near the river
in your area used to be our fort.

1071
01:23:26,734 --> 01:23:30,272
Saheb's ancestors
decimated my entire family.

1072
01:23:31,272 --> 01:23:34,549
Only one boy survived,
who continued the lineage.

1073
01:23:35,643 --> 01:23:37,520
It's been three generations...

1074
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:41,520
but, no one ever thought
of winning that fort back.

1075
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:46,560
I wonder why these thoughts...

1076
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:49,564
have been troubling
me since my childhood days.

1077
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:52,837
Do you have anything else to say?

1078
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:55,606
Anything else?

1079
01:23:56,497 --> 01:23:59,307
Madhvi, I was just trying to tell
you the truth that's in my heart...

1080
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:02,313
No. You've a sharp mind.

1081
01:24:02,403 --> 01:24:04,508
Very sharp.

1082
01:24:05,139 --> 01:24:07,141
You're... getting angry...

1083
01:24:15,249 --> 01:24:17,627
I've no friends.

1084
01:24:18,453 --> 01:24:20,194
Not a single one.

1085
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:23,667
Don't say that. You've me.

1086
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:27,336
You'll see me in the tears...

1087
01:24:27,428 --> 01:24:29,169
I mean, in your tears.

1088
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:34,377
For you, I hold no value.

1089
01:24:34,669 --> 01:24:36,444
But soon you will yearn for me.

1090
01:24:37,438 --> 01:24:39,611
See, I turned a poet for you.

1091
01:24:48,449 --> 01:24:50,793
So, when will you be a man?

1092
01:24:52,387 --> 01:24:54,162
Whenever you want?

1093
01:24:55,056 --> 01:24:56,763
Just give the orders.

1094
01:24:57,225 --> 01:24:59,205
Who do you want to kill?

1095
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:02,739
We will help each other.

1096
01:25:06,534 --> 01:25:10,243
But it'll be my decision
to end this war.

1097
01:25:12,073 --> 01:25:14,485
I want to finish Saheb's power.

1098
01:25:15,309 --> 01:25:18,085
But he should be unharmed.

1099
01:25:25,119 --> 01:25:27,429
I'm not concerned about his health.

1100
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:30,601
When I've his power.

1101
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:36,401
Every time you look at me,
do you feel love?

1102
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:38,838
Yes.

1103
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:41,410
Every word you say casts a spell.

1104
01:25:41,502 --> 01:25:42,537
Yes.

1105
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:45,810
See, you're lying.

1106
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:48,516
But I trust you.

1107
01:28:23,196 --> 01:28:25,972
Come on.

1108
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:16,360
He thrashed me severely, brother.

1109
01:29:16,450 --> 01:29:19,920
Made me drink chilly water.

1110
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:21,997
Don't spare him.

1111
01:29:22,189 --> 01:29:24,226
Don't spare him.

1112
01:29:24,591 --> 01:29:26,571
Don't spare him.

1113
01:29:30,597 --> 01:29:32,270
Don't spare him.

1114
01:29:32,933 --> 01:29:36,244
Don't spare him.

1115
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:37,974
Throw them in.

1116
01:29:38,572 --> 01:29:40,882
I'll tell you where to go.

1117
01:29:44,044 --> 01:29:46,923
He beats really cruelly.

1118
01:29:47,147 --> 01:29:48,057
Come here.

1119
01:29:48,148 --> 01:29:49,889
Brother! - Shut up!

1120
01:29:51,618 --> 01:29:53,427
Come here. I won't hurt you,
I just want to talk.

1121
01:29:53,553 --> 01:29:54,998
Come on.

1122
01:29:56,123 --> 01:29:58,296
He won't spare you. - Sit. Sit.

1123
01:29:58,392 --> 01:30:00,303
No, brother. - Shut up.

1124
01:30:02,195 --> 01:30:04,038
I won't beat you.
I just want to talk.

1125
01:30:04,231 --> 01:30:06,905
Look, I can kill you right now.

1126
01:30:07,234 --> 01:30:08,440
You will die.

1127
01:30:09,202 --> 01:30:13,378
Speak up, and you could be spared.

1128
01:30:13,774 --> 01:30:14,980
Get it.

1129
01:30:15,475 --> 01:30:20,083
No. No, brother.

1130
01:30:20,847 --> 01:30:23,157
No.

1131
01:30:25,952 --> 01:30:27,556
Kill him.

1132
01:30:34,995 --> 01:30:37,942
That's been taken care of. Okay.

1133
01:30:38,965 --> 01:30:40,308
He was a traitor.

1134
01:30:40,534 --> 01:30:42,036
He had to die.

1135
01:30:42,135 --> 01:30:47,983
But, the one you're
asking me to betray...

1136
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:51,580
will never spare us alive.

1137
01:30:51,912 --> 01:30:52,947
Listen.

1138
01:30:53,847 --> 01:30:57,192
This is a serious matter.
Don't make it confusing.

1139
01:30:57,918 --> 01:30:59,454
Everyone has to die.

1140
01:30:59,953 --> 01:31:02,524
You can die today,
or maybe live for a day or two.

1141
01:31:02,923 --> 01:31:04,493
Wait until the next elections.

1142
01:31:04,858 --> 01:31:06,565
Or the next Shahrukh Khan movie.

1143
01:31:06,827 --> 01:31:08,170
There's nothing wrong.

1144
01:31:09,362 --> 01:31:10,340
Who informed you that...

1145
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:12,467
the highway gangs
are being brought here?

1146
01:31:12,566 --> 01:31:13,874
We don't know anything.

1147
01:31:13,967 --> 01:31:16,345
Sir, it must be the one
who's bringing those dacoits here.

1148
01:31:16,436 --> 01:31:17,915
We'll wait a while and see.

1149
01:31:18,004 --> 01:31:19,381
Bring them, but who?

1150
01:31:28,014 --> 01:31:29,015
Sir.

1151
01:31:30,183 --> 01:31:31,161
What...

1152
01:31:31,485 --> 01:31:33,795
What's going on? Media?

1153
01:31:33,887 --> 01:31:35,423
Just a minute, sir.

1154
01:31:36,523 --> 01:31:38,161
They'll testify in
front of the media...

1155
01:31:38,258 --> 01:31:39,931
and it will become public.

1156
01:31:40,026 --> 01:31:42,131
No one will call
you to set them free.

1157
01:31:42,295 --> 01:31:45,936
But... who gave you
permission to do all this?

1158
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:47,237
Sir, I didn't have the permission...

1159
01:31:47,367 --> 01:31:49,278
but, I did the right thing.

1160
01:31:50,537 --> 01:31:52,278
You can get your picture taken.

1161
01:31:52,372 --> 01:31:55,148
Chauhan, bring them out.

1162
01:31:55,442 --> 01:31:59,015
Sir, let us talk to them...
- Stay back!

1163
01:31:59,146 --> 01:32:00,955
Back. Back. Move back.

1164
01:32:01,047 --> 01:32:03,220
They are criminals, not politicians.
Stay back.

1165
01:32:03,316 --> 01:32:04,886
Maintain distance.

1166
01:32:04,985 --> 01:32:06,965
Someone wants to talk to you.

1167
01:32:08,088 --> 01:32:08,566
Just because you're from
a well-known newspaper..

1168
01:32:08,822 --> 01:32:09,960
"Doesn't mean you do as you please.

1169
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:12,331
Sir's right here,
there's a protocol to be followed.

1170
01:32:12,425 --> 01:32:15,031
Sir. - Yes, go ahead.

1171
01:32:15,128 --> 01:32:17,404
How long have you been
committing these loots?

1172
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:21,875
For the past two-three years.

1173
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:25,316
Ask him who he works for?

1174
01:32:25,505 --> 01:32:28,816
So, who do you work for?

1175
01:32:34,047 --> 01:32:37,085
Kanhaiyya, he's our chief.

1176
01:32:38,118 --> 01:32:41,361
Kanhaiyya Saheb...

1177
01:33:14,321 --> 01:33:16,801
Are you here to arrest Kanhaiyya?

1178
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:19,097
Vasant's given a false statement.

1179
01:33:20,093 --> 01:33:21,970
You were supposed to get arrested...

1180
01:33:22,162 --> 01:33:24,438
but, he took
Kanhaiyya's name instead.

1181
01:33:26,866 --> 01:33:28,277
Sir, here's the death certificate.

1182
01:33:28,401 --> 01:33:30,347
You can take the
dead body for cremation.

1183
01:33:30,437 --> 01:33:31,882
Show me.

1184
01:33:42,916 --> 01:33:44,156
Wait.

1185
01:33:45,986 --> 01:33:46,964
How did he die?

1186
01:33:47,053 --> 01:33:48,498
Shocked.

1187
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:53,803
He couldn't tolerate
this humiliation.

1188
01:33:54,995 --> 01:33:56,906
And he died of shock.

1189
01:33:59,799 --> 01:34:02,245
I know it all.

1190
01:34:02,602 --> 01:34:04,548
You're the real chief.

1191
01:34:05,138 --> 01:34:06,947
He was just a soldier.

1192
01:34:07,307 --> 01:34:08,911
You're a soldier too.

1193
01:34:09,242 --> 01:34:11,313
So, who is your chief?

1194
01:34:12,045 --> 01:34:13,422
Just tell me.

1195
01:34:13,847 --> 01:34:16,350
You won't like to hear it.

1196
01:34:17,117 --> 01:34:20,155
You won't be able to
endure two shocks in one day.

1197
01:34:36,069 --> 01:34:38,447
Hello. - Can we talk?

1198
01:34:38,805 --> 01:34:40,409
Yes.

1199
01:34:41,241 --> 01:34:42,948
I can't say it over the phone.

1200
01:34:44,444 --> 01:34:45,980
Can you come over here?

1201
01:34:47,113 --> 01:34:49,423
So suddenly? - It's urgent.

1202
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:53,823
Fine. Tomorrow then. - Make it today.

1203
01:34:54,587 --> 01:34:56,066
I'll have to pack.

1204
01:34:56,156 --> 01:34:58,193
Pack only for day.

1205
01:34:58,792 --> 01:35:00,135
And come today.

1206
01:35:03,396 --> 01:35:04,898
Jagdish.

1207
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:08,943
Jagdish!

1208
01:35:09,102 --> 01:35:10,206
Yes... Yes Saheb.

1209
01:35:10,837 --> 01:35:11,907
That's been done, madam.

1210
01:35:12,005 --> 01:35:14,383
And the new file's been passed...
- Madam.

1211
01:35:14,474 --> 01:35:16,078
Madam, our application...

1212
01:35:22,315 --> 01:35:23,419
Pass me the N65.

1213
01:35:30,790 --> 01:35:32,098
Turn the phone on, sir.

1214
01:35:38,798 --> 01:35:40,300
Stop that car at the left.

1215
01:35:46,039 --> 01:35:47,313
I'll be right back.

1216
01:36:47,867 --> 01:36:48,470
Hello.

1217
01:36:48,568 --> 01:36:50,980
I've been calling you for two hours.

1218
01:36:51,070 --> 01:36:52,071
My phone was switched off.

1219
01:36:52,172 --> 01:36:53,207
It wasn't working,
so I gave it for repairing.

1220
01:36:53,339 --> 01:36:54,443
I just got it back.

1221
01:36:58,144 --> 01:37:00,420
Look, I've been called to Devgarh.
- Devgarh?

1222
01:37:00,513 --> 01:37:01,651
Yes.

1223
01:37:02,048 --> 01:37:03,049
So suddenly?

1224
01:37:04,284 --> 01:37:05,319
For how long?

1225
01:37:05,418 --> 01:37:07,295
I was asked to pack only for a day.

1226
01:37:07,387 --> 01:37:08,923
One day? - Yes.

1227
01:37:10,824 --> 01:37:12,235
Greetings, Her Highness.

1228
01:37:13,593 --> 01:37:14,367
What brings you here?

1229
01:37:14,461 --> 01:37:16,099
I'm counting the trees in this area.

1230
01:37:16,362 --> 01:37:18,273
My car's broken down, give it a push.

1231
01:37:19,399 --> 01:37:20,537
Come on.

1232
01:37:23,236 --> 01:37:25,182
Something doesn't feel right.

1233
01:37:30,009 --> 01:37:31,955
Is Saheb planning the wedding?

1234
01:37:32,045 --> 01:37:34,855
I don't know,
just keep your phone on.

1235
01:37:35,915 --> 01:37:37,826
Hello. Hello...

1236
01:37:38,585 --> 01:37:39,529
Hello.

1237
01:37:49,963 --> 01:37:52,603
Jagdish, we've guests. - Yes.

1238
01:37:53,132 --> 01:37:54,076
Show her to her room...

1239
01:37:54,167 --> 01:37:56,977
and tell her we'll
meet over breakfast.

1240
01:37:57,203 --> 01:37:58,409
Yes.

1241
01:39:02,068 --> 01:39:04,605
Take me in your arms...

1242
01:39:04,871 --> 01:39:13,586
this beautiful moment
might not come again.

1243
01:39:13,846 --> 01:39:18,846
Maybe we won't meet
again in this lifetime.

1244
01:39:24,991 --> 01:39:29,269
Take me in your arms...

1245
01:39:45,378 --> 01:39:46,857
lnder.

1246
01:39:47,413 --> 01:39:57,164
I'm fortunate to get these moments.

1247
01:39:58,891 --> 01:40:03,965
Take a good look...

1248
01:40:04,430 --> 01:40:05,636
lnder.

1249
01:40:06,399 --> 01:40:07,901
What are you doing here?

1250
01:40:08,101 --> 01:40:09,444
You...

1251
01:40:10,470 --> 01:40:14,782
I came to see you.

1252
01:40:14,974 --> 01:40:17,284
We couldn't meet this morning.

1253
01:40:17,877 --> 01:40:19,413
So, I thought that
maybe you're angry...

1254
01:40:19,512 --> 01:40:22,322
You... came all the way here!

1255
01:40:22,849 --> 01:40:29,494
Maybe we won't meet
again in this lifetime.

1256
01:40:29,589 --> 01:40:32,593
Where? - Inside?

1257
01:40:32,859 --> 01:40:35,135
Take me in your arms...

1258
01:40:50,076 --> 01:40:54,456
I thought you might be angry,
so I must apologies.

1259
01:40:57,016 --> 01:40:58,120
Take it off.

1260
01:40:59,819 --> 01:41:00,889
What?

1261
01:41:02,055 --> 01:41:06,629
You're here to apologies,
so you'll have to bow down.

1262
01:42:06,385 --> 01:42:09,059
I called you in a hurry.

1263
01:42:10,323 --> 01:42:11,802
I apologies.

1264
01:42:12,191 --> 01:42:14,398
It was no trouble coming here.

1265
01:42:14,994 --> 01:42:16,496
It's just that I
didn't know why, so...

1266
01:42:16,763 --> 01:42:22,145
Your eyes convey that
I troubled you a lot.

1267
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:28,813
This...

1268
01:42:32,145 --> 01:42:35,558
A gift for you.

1269
01:42:38,985 --> 01:42:43,365
This cannot make up
for the mistakes I made...

1270
01:42:45,224 --> 01:42:47,898
. but, I called you
here to say that...

1271
01:42:51,297 --> 01:42:53,800
I'm breaking this engagement.

1272
01:42:54,367 --> 01:42:56,574
You cannot always do as you please.

1273
01:42:56,836 --> 01:42:59,248
You cannot break this engagement
as and when you please.

1274
01:42:59,839 --> 01:43:03,844
Since I made this mistake,
everything's going wrong.

1275
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:05,614
And, I am responsible for it?

1276
01:43:09,248 --> 01:43:11,956
It's in the air here.

1277
01:43:14,387 --> 01:43:18,529
Every good thing gets spoilt.

1278
01:43:22,028 --> 01:43:26,534
There's a conspiracy
behind every relation.

1279
01:43:28,568 --> 01:43:32,209
I don't want you to
be just a lifeless image.

1280
01:43:32,772 --> 01:43:38,882
I... have stolen many glances of you.

1281
01:43:39,345 --> 01:43:40,790
What?

1282
01:44:51,450 --> 01:44:53,794
Hello. - I want to talk to you.

1283
01:44:54,253 --> 01:44:56,130
But, can't do it over the phone.

1284
01:44:56,555 --> 01:44:59,263
Shall I come over, or will you?

1285
01:45:00,426 --> 01:45:02,372
I am coming.

1286
01:45:13,739 --> 01:45:17,209
I... I want to tell you something.

1287
01:45:18,544 --> 01:45:20,751
You have many enemies, Saheb.

1288
01:45:21,347 --> 01:45:24,123
Why are you telling me this?

1289
01:45:25,851 --> 01:45:30,493
Your pictures made me turn a traitor.

1290
01:45:32,391 --> 01:45:34,029
You were right.

1291
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:36,535
There's something in the air here...

1292
01:45:37,129 --> 01:45:39,336
that spoils every good thing.

1293
01:45:54,981 --> 01:46:00,954
Every corner... of my heart echoed.

1294
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:07,236
The moon smiled from the clouds.

1295
01:46:08,561 --> 01:46:14,102
I was betrayed.

1296
01:46:15,067 --> 01:46:20,244
How far have I come?

1297
01:46:20,573 --> 01:46:26,489
Now, I need to stop.

1298
01:46:26,979 --> 01:46:33,123
And fill the void.

1299
01:46:33,352 --> 01:46:39,200
Every corner of my heart echoed.

1300
01:46:39,625 --> 01:46:45,507
The moon smiled from the clouds.

1301
01:46:45,831 --> 01:46:52,146
Why do dreams make me smile?

1302
01:46:52,505 --> 01:46:59,150
Even the nights look pleasant.

1303
01:47:04,116 --> 01:47:05,857
WOW!

1304
01:47:15,995 --> 01:47:17,531
Ranjana.

1305
01:47:18,030 --> 01:47:18,872
How are you?

1306
01:47:18,964 --> 01:47:20,034
All fine.

1307
01:47:20,132 --> 01:47:22,237
Why are you answering in-short?

1308
01:47:23,302 --> 01:47:25,805
Anyone around? - Yes.

1309
01:47:25,905 --> 01:47:27,111
I see.

1310
01:47:27,206 --> 01:47:29,015
Listen.

1311
01:47:29,108 --> 01:47:31,088
Don't worry, Ranjana.

1312
01:47:31,277 --> 01:47:34,884
Just a few more days,
and then its all over.

1313
01:47:36,582 --> 01:47:37,822
Bye.

1314
01:47:37,983 --> 01:47:40,327
Bye, darling.

1315
01:47:46,358 --> 01:47:48,099
What? - Come on!

1316
01:48:06,512 --> 01:48:07,616
Come on, smile now.

1317
01:48:07,847 --> 01:48:08,882
One smile.

1318
01:48:09,315 --> 01:48:11,955
This day will be recorded in history.

1319
01:48:12,051 --> 01:48:13,792
These four independent MLAs'...

1320
01:48:13,886 --> 01:48:18,062
who were against the division
of the state are now in favor of it.

1321
01:48:18,324 --> 01:48:21,032
And, they've also
joined the CM's party.

1322
01:48:21,127 --> 01:48:23,129
Madhvi Singh's is in
direct collision course...

1323
01:48:23,229 --> 01:48:26,870
with her husband,
Aditya Pratap Singh.

1324
01:48:26,966 --> 01:48:29,446
And all these
developments indicate...

1325
01:48:29,835 --> 01:48:31,940
that the division
of the states is certain.

1326
01:48:35,908 --> 01:48:39,913
The question is,
why isn't there any development.

1327
01:48:40,045 --> 01:48:42,457
The reason behind it isn't
just corrupt politicians.

1328
01:48:42,581 --> 01:48:43,958
Population.

1329
01:48:44,083 --> 01:48:48,259
Just like the vast population
is a issue for the country...

1330
01:48:48,454 --> 01:48:55,565
similarly one state cannot
cater to this huge populace.

1331
01:48:56,095 --> 01:48:58,006
Far sightedness.

1332
01:48:58,230 --> 01:49:01,473
One needs far sightedness
to do this task.

1333
01:49:01,967 --> 01:49:06,916
This state can develop only when...

1334
01:49:07,173 --> 01:49:11,451
four new states are born.

1335
01:49:12,511 --> 01:49:14,582
Vande Mataram!

1336
01:49:16,315 --> 01:49:18,056
Vande Mataram!

1337
01:49:18,150 --> 01:49:22,826
And, these four MLAs
have proven my point.

1338
01:49:23,455 --> 01:49:24,126
Sunder.

1339
01:49:25,824 --> 01:49:27,030
Jagdish.

1340
01:49:28,794 --> 01:49:29,898
Sunder.

1341
01:49:31,230 --> 01:49:34,939
Her determination, hard work...

1342
01:49:35,067 --> 01:49:36,978
is appreciated by our government.

1343
01:49:37,369 --> 01:49:38,541
Sunder.

1344
01:49:38,971 --> 01:49:41,042
Don't be scared. I'll help you.

1345
01:49:41,407 --> 01:49:42,545
Where do you want to go?

1346
01:49:42,975 --> 01:49:46,013
You took the gun out.
Did someone scare you?

1347
01:49:46,111 --> 01:49:50,423
I took the gun out long ago,
but you just saw it.

1348
01:49:52,318 --> 01:49:54,059
Have we met before?

1349
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:55,626
No.

1350
01:49:56,388 --> 01:49:58,390
But I know you.

1351
01:50:00,826 --> 01:50:02,635
I... am lndrajeet Singh.

1352
01:50:02,895 --> 01:50:06,866
You shouldn't have
approached me from the back.

1353
01:50:07,466 --> 01:50:09,412
Firstly, I'm wounded.

1354
01:50:10,035 --> 01:50:13,073
And my enemies have always
attacked me from behind.

1355
01:50:14,773 --> 01:50:16,480
If I had fired...

1356
01:50:16,842 --> 01:50:19,482
A Thakur would've died
at the hands of a Thakur.

1357
01:50:20,446 --> 01:50:22,050
Right.

1358
01:50:24,283 --> 01:50:28,231
Next time, it will face-to-face.

1359
01:50:31,790 --> 01:50:34,964
I know my kin, my family
will be hurt by my decision.

1360
01:50:37,296 --> 01:50:41,938
And to save it, I can leave home.

1361
01:50:42,067 --> 01:50:45,048
Wow! Wonderful!

1362
01:50:45,938 --> 01:50:47,440
Madhvi.

1363
01:50:49,408 --> 01:50:50,910
She speaks well.

1364
01:50:51,010 --> 01:50:53,854
Yes, she didn't have
this quality before.

1365
01:50:54,113 --> 01:50:57,219
And you will see the
effect in a few years.

1366
01:50:57,316 --> 01:50:59,956
It's a new development. - What?

1367
01:51:02,588 --> 01:51:05,296
Wonder who she's been influenced by.

1368
01:51:06,058 --> 01:51:09,198
Who says you can't
make a hole in the sky?

1369
01:51:09,295 --> 01:51:12,936
Who says you can't
make a hole in the sky?

1370
01:51:13,299 --> 01:51:17,770
Try hurling a stone
with all your might.

1371
01:51:18,037 --> 01:51:20,313
Wonderful!

1372
01:51:20,839 --> 01:51:22,409
Wonderful, Madhvi.

1373
01:51:27,112 --> 01:51:28,989
This is the daily routine.

1374
01:51:29,081 --> 01:51:31,061
Rudy. Where is she?

1375
01:51:31,150 --> 01:51:32,993
Where's the real deal?

1376
01:51:33,085 --> 01:51:34,894
Its coming, Tiwari.

1377
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:36,863
Sit down. Be patient.

1378
01:51:36,955 --> 01:51:37,956
Patience?

1379
01:51:38,057 --> 01:51:40,867
My eyes are getting sore.

1380
01:51:43,329 --> 01:51:45,331
She's coming.

1381
01:51:47,933 --> 01:51:49,378
She's here.

1382
01:51:49,935 --> 01:51:54,077
Here I come. - Come here.

1383
01:52:04,917 --> 01:52:08,797
Shall I tell this to the media...
publicly?

1384
01:52:08,887 --> 01:52:13,495
Shall I tell this to the media...
publicly?

1385
01:52:13,759 --> 01:52:18,003
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1386
01:52:18,097 --> 01:52:23,206
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1387
01:52:23,869 --> 01:52:27,908
Shall I tell this to the media...
publicly?

1388
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:32,580
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1389
01:52:33,078 --> 01:52:37,527
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1390
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:05,988
You were a man. Tall and strong.
Never feared anyone.

1391
01:53:06,612 --> 01:53:11,083
Since you became a politician,
you've lost all zest and zeal.

1392
01:53:11,383 --> 01:53:15,889
This bed was meant for two,
but now it misses all the action.

1393
01:53:16,021 --> 01:53:20,766
It now prays for solace.

1394
01:53:20,859 --> 01:53:25,501
The heart desires
those good old days back.

1395
01:53:25,764 --> 01:53:30,235
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1396
01:53:40,345 --> 01:53:44,851
You would hold me so romantically.

1397
01:53:45,217 --> 01:53:49,188
You would cajole me each time I was
upset, those were beautiful moments.

1398
01:53:49,288 --> 01:53:50,130
Tiwari.

1399
01:53:50,222 --> 01:53:52,327
You take me in your
arms and shout slogans.

1400
01:53:52,424 --> 01:53:54,461
I don't like that.

1401
01:53:54,893 --> 01:53:57,203
Be the minister of my heart.

1402
01:53:57,296 --> 01:53:59,401
Don't trouble me anymore.

1403
01:53:59,531 --> 01:54:04,105
Don't let those bad
days come back again.

1404
01:54:04,203 --> 01:54:09,084
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1405
01:54:14,279 --> 01:54:18,386
Shall I tell this to the media...
publicly?

1406
01:54:18,517 --> 01:54:23,227
Shall I tell this to the media...
publicly?

1407
01:54:23,322 --> 01:54:27,930
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1408
01:54:28,126 --> 01:54:32,575
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1409
01:54:32,931 --> 01:54:37,209
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1410
01:54:37,769 --> 01:54:42,377
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1411
01:54:42,508 --> 01:54:45,079
Where are you going?

1412
01:54:46,044 --> 01:54:47,785
Come here.

1413
01:54:50,182 --> 01:54:54,528
Come on.

1414
01:54:54,786 --> 01:54:56,925
Where should I hide?

1415
01:54:57,589 --> 01:54:58,590
Caught you.

1416
01:54:58,857 --> 01:55:00,234
I want to play too.

1417
01:55:00,325 --> 01:55:03,204
I'll give you a chocolate?

1418
01:55:06,932 --> 01:55:11,176
Did you say anything else to Saheb?

1419
01:55:18,377 --> 01:55:21,221
No. Just praised you.

1420
01:55:22,014 --> 01:55:23,925
You don't know Saheb.

1421
01:55:24,116 --> 01:55:25,561
He can do anything.

1422
01:55:26,351 --> 01:55:27,557
And that Ranjana.

1423
01:55:27,819 --> 01:55:30,026
He's very close to Saheb.

1424
01:55:40,432 --> 01:55:43,811
Will you do something for me?
- Just name it.

1425
01:55:46,271 --> 01:55:48,012
Kill that Ranjana for me.

1426
01:55:50,142 --> 01:55:51,519
Will you kill her?

1427
01:55:56,582 --> 01:55:58,789
Father, I'm sure it will
be in everyone's interest.

1428
01:55:59,017 --> 01:56:01,258
Just talk to him.

1429
01:56:02,054 --> 01:56:03,192
Yes.

1430
01:56:06,224 --> 01:56:07,567
It's father.

1431
01:56:11,396 --> 01:56:13,034
Good morning, Bunny uncle.

1432
01:56:15,067 --> 01:56:18,241
I want to apologize.

1433
01:56:19,605 --> 01:56:22,313
Yes. Rudy's under pressure as well.

1434
01:56:22,407 --> 01:56:24,216
Madhvi's with you too.

1435
01:56:24,476 --> 01:56:27,821
I don't like our personal
argument getting public.

1436
01:56:28,013 --> 01:56:29,617
I admit my mistake.

1437
01:56:29,881 --> 01:56:31,451
I just want to meet once.

1438
01:56:31,583 --> 01:56:33,995
Call Akshay and lshaan.

1439
01:56:34,152 --> 01:56:35,290
I will call Rudy.

1440
01:56:35,387 --> 01:56:38,061
Don't tell Madhvi about this meeting.

1441
01:56:38,357 --> 01:56:40,268
I want to surprise her.

1442
01:56:40,459 --> 01:56:42,268
I'll call a few journalists.

1443
01:56:42,561 --> 01:56:45,440
Why do a good thing
when nobody's watching?

1444
01:56:45,631 --> 01:56:46,905
Right?

1445
01:56:55,941 --> 01:56:57,045
What's all this?

1446
01:56:57,142 --> 01:56:59,918
Seems like the entire market.

1447
01:57:03,615 --> 01:57:05,253
What do you want?

1448
01:57:05,417 --> 01:57:08,125
Looks like he's prepared
for an entire army.

1449
01:57:16,461 --> 01:57:19,931
So, Aditya, what do you want to say?

1450
01:57:38,483 --> 01:57:40,156
What do you want?

1451
01:57:40,252 --> 01:57:43,631
I want everything to be normal
once the bill's passed tomorrow.

1452
01:57:44,423 --> 01:57:46,061
Ranjana...

1453
01:57:46,324 --> 01:57:47,962
We'll call-off this engagement.

1454
01:57:48,260 --> 01:57:49,933
And throw a big party...

1455
01:57:50,062 --> 01:57:52,565
where we'll tell everyone
about our association.

1456
01:57:53,065 --> 01:57:54,373
I want to surprise Madhvi as well.

1457
01:57:54,466 --> 01:57:56,503
I hope you didn't
tell Madhvi about this.

1458
01:57:56,902 --> 01:57:59,382
I... You asked me not to.

1459
01:57:59,471 --> 01:58:01,382
So how could I?

1460
01:58:01,640 --> 01:58:03,176
We're a man of our words.

1461
01:58:03,275 --> 01:58:05,482
Great. Wonderful.

1462
01:58:33,038 --> 01:58:36,281
We've always considered
you a family member.

1463
01:58:36,374 --> 01:58:39,878
Not just me, all of us.

1464
01:58:39,978 --> 01:58:42,117
But you always bullied us.

1465
01:58:42,214 --> 01:58:44,251
See. It's karma, Aditya.

1466
01:58:44,416 --> 01:58:47,056
And we meant nothing to you.

1467
01:58:47,419 --> 01:58:49,160
Come on, come on, guys.

1468
01:58:49,254 --> 01:58:52,394
Let's all have a drink.
- Aditya, want some?

1469
01:58:52,824 --> 01:58:54,326
Don't drink too much.

1470
01:58:54,593 --> 01:58:56,072
You'll fall short of it.

1471
01:58:56,294 --> 01:58:58,274
How do you have a phone?

1472
01:58:58,363 --> 01:59:00,309
Fine, bolt the windows from outside.

1473
01:59:00,398 --> 01:59:02,878
Aditya, how did you
bring the phone inside?

1474
01:59:03,001 --> 01:59:07,882
All these things, the juice, water...

1475
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:10,417
all that's for everyone.

1476
01:59:10,542 --> 01:59:11,885
What?

1477
01:59:12,010 --> 01:59:15,355
It means, you all will have
to stay in this room for a few days.

1478
01:59:15,881 --> 01:59:16,291
What?

1479
01:59:16,381 --> 01:59:20,454
You must have felt really
happy seeing me apologize.

1480
01:59:21,019 --> 01:59:25,024
Pardon me,
but your happiness was short-lived.

1481
01:59:25,123 --> 01:59:26,568
Has he lost it?

1482
01:59:26,825 --> 01:59:28,304
Have you lost your mind?

1483
01:59:28,393 --> 01:59:31,340
Rudy. Don't get too excited.

1484
01:59:31,429 --> 01:59:34,137
Excited. What excitement?

1485
01:59:35,801 --> 01:59:37,474
Aditya!

1486
01:59:39,404 --> 01:59:40,280
Aditya!

1487
01:59:40,372 --> 01:59:44,548
I'll have no qualms
about killing you.

1488
01:59:46,845 --> 01:59:48,620
I've can stand up now.

1489
01:59:49,481 --> 01:59:52,360
And now, I'll bully you more.

1490
01:59:58,390 --> 02:00:00,165
Tariq. - Vishnu.

1491
02:00:02,961 --> 02:00:04,133
What's happening?

1492
02:00:10,435 --> 02:00:12,210
Please be quiet.

1493
02:00:12,304 --> 02:00:14,011
Calm down.

1494
02:00:14,272 --> 02:00:15,945
Quiet! Quiet!

1495
02:00:16,041 --> 02:00:18,248
They're unreachable
since yesterday...

1496
02:00:18,343 --> 02:00:20,846
and they had to be at
the assembly, but they are missing.

1497
02:00:20,946 --> 02:00:24,894
How can I answer
you without asking them?

1498
02:00:25,217 --> 02:00:27,993
It can be a conspiracy.
- Of course it is.

1499
02:00:28,086 --> 02:00:29,827
Or, someone's pressurized them.

1500
02:00:29,921 --> 02:00:31,923
Pressure?

1501
02:00:32,123 --> 02:00:33,466
Who could pressurize them?

1502
02:00:33,592 --> 02:00:35,037
They could've been kidnapped too.

1503
02:00:35,126 --> 02:00:37,470
What have you done about it?
- Tell us.

1504
02:00:39,798 --> 02:00:43,075
Madhvi ma'am...

1505
02:00:43,168 --> 02:00:44,875
Madhvi ma'am.
Madhvi ma'am, please wait.

1506
02:00:44,970 --> 02:00:46,472
Hey, you blue shirt.

1507
02:00:46,938 --> 02:00:47,939
What were you saying?

1508
02:00:48,073 --> 02:00:49,450
Sir, the opposition
can be behind this.

1509
02:00:49,574 --> 02:00:51,281
The opposition can't be behind this.

1510
02:00:51,376 --> 02:00:53,151
All the goons are in his party.

1511
02:00:54,212 --> 02:00:56,351
Say that openly. - It's true!

1512
02:00:56,982 --> 02:00:59,929
I won't tolerate this misbehavior.

1513
02:01:00,051 --> 02:01:01,462
Sir.

1514
02:01:01,820 --> 02:01:04,232
The division's been annulled,
will the CM be changed too?

1515
02:01:04,322 --> 02:01:05,562
Just a minute.

1516
02:01:05,957 --> 02:01:06,958
Jai Hind, sir.

1517
02:01:07,425 --> 02:01:08,904
Yes, sir.

1518
02:01:09,928 --> 02:01:12,807
Sir, let's wait for a few days.

1519
02:01:16,067 --> 02:01:17,273
Look.

1520
02:01:18,236 --> 02:01:20,307
I'm no longer the
party's spokesperson.

1521
02:01:20,939 --> 02:01:23,317
That means the CM's changed.

1522
02:01:26,778 --> 02:01:28,121
We've been deceived!

1523
02:01:28,213 --> 02:01:30,022
We've been deceived!

1524
02:01:30,115 --> 02:01:32,527
They should've told us they
weren't coming to the assembly.

1525
02:01:32,784 --> 02:01:34,286
Is Saheb behind this?

1526
02:01:34,386 --> 02:01:37,299
Of course. - No photos.

1527
02:01:37,522 --> 02:01:39,263
It's Saheb. - No photos.

1528
02:01:40,058 --> 02:01:42,060
We've been deceived!

1529
02:01:42,427 --> 02:01:44,429
Why are you stopping us?

1530
02:01:45,563 --> 02:01:47,565
You're getting violent these days.

1531
02:01:48,867 --> 02:01:50,574
Control yourself.

1532
02:01:51,803 --> 02:01:54,545
Now they'll publish nonsense
about you every day.

1533
02:02:02,213 --> 02:02:05,194
Take some of this,
and get some sleep.

1534
02:02:13,291 --> 02:02:17,535
When I turned to my right
I saw a big fully grown tiger.

1535
02:02:18,196 --> 02:02:20,403
I had no idea... - My God.

1536
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:37,260
Hello. - Ranjana.

1537
02:02:38,149 --> 02:02:39,355
Yes.

1538
02:02:40,218 --> 02:02:43,290
I want to meet you tomorrow,
in any condition.

1539
02:02:44,356 --> 02:02:46,063
I've a plan.

1540
02:02:48,827 --> 02:02:50,534
Just one blow.

1541
02:02:51,363 --> 02:02:54,071
Where? - At my palace.

1542
02:02:54,799 --> 02:02:56,039
Okay?

1543
02:02:56,835 --> 02:02:58,610
Yes.

1544
02:02:59,304 --> 02:03:00,442
Okay.

1545
02:03:00,805 --> 02:03:02,580
I love you, my darling.

1546
02:03:22,394 --> 02:03:24,135
This was our hall.

1547
02:03:24,929 --> 02:03:27,034
We used to have parties here.

1548
02:03:31,770 --> 02:03:34,182
This was the biggest
fort in the area.

1549
02:03:37,942 --> 02:03:42,448
Now do you understand
why I took so much pride?

1550
02:03:48,319 --> 02:03:51,095
The gun Saheb keeps waiving around...

1551
02:03:51,589 --> 02:03:54,399
you need to get that.

1552
02:03:58,430 --> 02:04:00,376
You've to kill Madhvi.

1553
02:04:04,502 --> 02:04:05,947
At night.

1554
02:04:07,372 --> 02:04:09,045
At the time she listens to the music.

1555
02:04:12,310 --> 02:04:14,756
No one has a gun in the house.

1556
02:04:14,979 --> 02:04:17,323
Listen. - Yes.

1557
02:04:18,383 --> 02:04:21,421
Saheb and Madhvi's relation
is spoiled, everyone knows that.

1558
02:04:22,287 --> 02:04:24,062
No one else will be accused for it.

1559
02:04:24,923 --> 02:04:27,369
Saheb will be arrested for murder,
case closed.

1560
02:04:29,194 --> 02:04:30,298
Can you do it?

1561
02:04:31,996 --> 02:04:34,203
Come. I'll introduce you to someone.

1562
02:04:36,901 --> 02:04:39,074
This is my younger brother,
Param. - Hello.

1563
02:04:41,306 --> 02:04:43,047
Hey. Who was that?

1564
02:04:46,544 --> 02:04:47,284
Back.

1565
02:04:47,378 --> 02:04:49,483
Stay here. I'll be right back.

1566
02:05:06,197 --> 02:05:07,403
See anyone?

1567
02:05:07,532 --> 02:05:09,341
Ranjana, leave now.

1568
02:05:09,467 --> 02:05:10,502
Whoever it was, he was sent by Saheb.

1569
02:05:10,768 --> 02:05:12,008
He has seen us together.

1570
02:05:12,270 --> 02:05:13,180
But, listen.

1571
02:05:13,271 --> 02:05:14,443
What will you say to Saheb?

1572
02:05:14,539 --> 02:05:16,485
I'll say that I wandered
to this place accidentally...

1573
02:05:16,741 --> 02:05:18,743
and you caught me.

1574
02:05:19,110 --> 02:05:20,180
And...

1575
02:05:21,312 --> 02:05:22,382
Fine, you go.

1576
02:05:22,514 --> 02:05:24,960
And, will you handle it? - Yes.

1577
02:05:25,150 --> 02:05:27,994
What about the gun? - I will try.

1578
02:05:29,053 --> 02:05:33,763
Look, just get the gun.
I will kill her.

1579
02:05:34,526 --> 02:05:37,200
I can go to any limits for this war.

1580
02:05:37,996 --> 02:05:39,066
Okay.

1581
02:05:51,910 --> 02:05:55,483
Brother, we shouldn't
be sitting out in the open.

1582
02:05:55,580 --> 02:05:58,527
You never know who might attack us?

1583
02:05:58,950 --> 02:06:00,520
That's the reason I'm
sitting out in the open.

1584
02:06:00,785 --> 02:06:02,264
I want someone to attack.

1585
02:06:03,188 --> 02:06:04,292
Let him.

1586
02:06:04,389 --> 02:06:06,335
So I would know who he is.

1587
02:06:07,192 --> 02:06:08,432
What are you staring at?

1588
02:06:08,826 --> 02:06:09,804
Anything interesting?

1589
02:06:09,894 --> 02:06:11,532
Who are you talking to?

1590
02:06:13,131 --> 02:06:15,008
You rascal.

1591
02:06:16,067 --> 02:06:17,375
Beat him.

1592
02:06:22,607 --> 02:06:23,915
Ranjana.

1593
02:06:24,509 --> 02:06:27,422
After travelling towards the jungle
for 12 kilometers from Bandnapur...

1594
02:06:27,512 --> 02:06:29,116
you'll come across a mud house.

1595
02:06:29,847 --> 02:06:32,259
You will find all your answers there.

1596
02:07:10,421 --> 02:07:13,061
Hold it. Hold it.

1597
02:07:13,491 --> 02:07:14,868
Turn around.

1598
02:07:16,027 --> 02:07:17,267
Turn around.

1599
02:07:27,071 --> 02:07:29,347
So I heard right about you.

1600
02:07:30,475 --> 02:07:32,284
Kanhaiyya never dies.

1601
02:07:32,377 --> 02:07:34,516
And he won't die today either.

1602
02:07:52,063 --> 02:07:55,601
You wanted to know my chief, right?

1603
02:07:56,034 --> 02:07:57,172
So, tell me.

1604
02:07:58,469 --> 02:08:00,278
Inderjeet Singh.

1605
02:08:01,839 --> 02:08:03,443
My elder brother.

1606
02:08:04,642 --> 02:08:09,216
And do you want to know
something about your family?

1607
02:08:09,914 --> 02:08:10,949
What?

1608
02:08:11,115 --> 02:08:13,891
Your great grandmother
ran away from home.

1609
02:08:14,552 --> 02:08:15,530
Then?

1610
02:08:16,454 --> 02:08:20,994
She betrayed the one she eloped with.

1611
02:08:22,460 --> 02:08:27,034
Then your family decimated
her entire family.

1612
02:08:28,599 --> 02:08:33,571
And the one she ran away
with was my great grandfather.

1613
02:08:43,281 --> 02:08:49,527
By the way, the women of
your family are really famous.

1614
02:08:51,189 --> 02:08:57,606
I heard that your wife was
having an affair with some Bablu...

1615
02:09:23,988 --> 02:09:25,331
Let's get out. Quickly.

1616
02:09:25,523 --> 02:09:27,025
Is the press around.

1617
02:09:27,125 --> 02:09:29,867
Aditya, rascal.

1618
02:09:29,961 --> 02:09:31,440
Don't abuse him.

1619
02:10:05,596 --> 02:10:07,837
No one will talk about this anymore.

1620
02:10:07,932 --> 02:10:09,878
Hello, congratulations.

1621
02:11:48,432 --> 02:11:50,434
What do you say, Kanhaiyya?

1622
02:11:51,402 --> 02:11:53,814
Was I right to remarry?

1623
02:11:54,939 --> 02:11:56,577
All I wish is your
good health, Saheb.

1624
02:11:57,308 --> 02:11:59,117
That's all I care about.

1625
02:12:06,017 --> 02:12:08,554
Everyone said Kanhaiyya
is Saheb's shadow.

1626
02:12:09,120 --> 02:12:14,035
But now, you've to hide from
your own shadow because of me.

1627
02:12:15,092 --> 02:12:16,503
That's fine, Saheb.

1628
02:12:18,162 --> 02:12:20,836
I never liked the crowd anyway.

1629
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,240
Cheers.

1630
02:12:25,937 --> 02:12:26,915
Drink.

1631
02:12:27,171 --> 02:12:28,172
You...

1632
02:12:31,509 --> 02:12:34,422
As soon as I reached there,
that was it...

1633
02:12:34,879 --> 02:12:36,153
You were saying...

1634
02:12:36,380 --> 02:12:39,418
Param sir was a daring officer.

1635
02:12:40,551 --> 02:12:43,088
He would've survived
if he had taken us along.

1636
02:12:43,254 --> 02:12:45,928
He asked us not to follow.

1637
02:12:46,023 --> 02:12:48,025
And asked us to
surround from the back.

1638
02:12:58,135 --> 02:13:01,605
Hello, I wanted a favor.

1639
02:13:04,375 --> 02:13:06,184
For the last time.

1640
02:14:12,910 --> 02:14:16,448
There was once a king and a queen.

1641
02:14:33,798 --> 02:14:35,141
Go inside and tell them.

1642
02:14:35,232 --> 02:14:36,802
You can go inside
only over my dead body.

1643
02:14:37,068 --> 02:14:40,174
Sir. This man shot my brother dead.

1644
02:14:40,304 --> 02:14:42,147
You cannot even touch him,
- Please arrest him.

1645
02:14:42,239 --> 02:14:44,219
Look, this is a police case.

1646
02:14:44,408 --> 02:14:47,821
If you interfere,
you'll have to pay for it dearly.

1647
02:14:48,112 --> 02:14:50,058
What can you do? - What's going on?

1648
02:14:50,581 --> 02:14:52,788
Saheb! You will have to come
to the police station with us.

1649
02:14:53,050 --> 02:14:54,256
We've an arrest warrant for you.

1650
02:14:54,351 --> 02:14:57,264
To hell with your arrest... - Sunder.

1651
02:14:59,123 --> 02:15:00,329
Come, Saheb.

1652
02:15:06,897 --> 02:15:08,808
Go inside and get the evidence.

1653
02:15:08,899 --> 02:15:10,276
Let me talk to the CM.

1654
02:15:11,068 --> 02:15:12,103
Hello. - Sir.

1655
02:15:25,883 --> 02:15:26,884
Sir.

1656
02:15:27,118 --> 02:15:28,563
Here's the revolver, sir.

1657
02:15:36,227 --> 02:15:38,036
Hey. No one will take any picture.

1658
02:15:38,129 --> 02:15:39,938
Let's go, sir.

1659
02:15:40,331 --> 02:15:41,810
Let's go, sir.

1660
02:15:42,466 --> 02:15:45,242
Sir, we won't tolerate
violent behavior.

1661
02:16:19,203 --> 02:16:20,443
What's happened?

1662
02:16:20,838 --> 02:16:22,078
What's going on?

1663
02:16:22,473 --> 02:16:24,817
Someone has sent this for you.

1664
02:16:27,211 --> 02:16:31,284
We had a seen a dream,
but couldn't fulfill it.

1665
02:16:34,819 --> 02:16:37,390
We had to fulfill it together.

1666
02:16:38,823 --> 02:16:41,565
And you suddenly
disappeared from the scene.

1667
02:16:42,226 --> 02:16:43,432
What happened?

1668
02:16:43,994 --> 02:16:46,634
What happened, Ranjana?

1669
02:16:49,266 --> 02:16:51,075
I've a personal war.

1670
02:16:51,168 --> 02:16:54,843
Mine alone, and I'm ending it.

1671
02:16:55,573 --> 02:16:57,553
And I am winning it too.

1672
02:16:59,009 --> 02:17:02,889
I can't celebrate my victory.

1673
02:17:21,298 --> 02:17:23,938
I will definitely trouble you.

1674
02:17:24,568 --> 02:17:27,276
You cannot forget me.

1675
02:17:28,172 --> 02:17:30,174
I'll come in your dreams.

1676
02:17:32,810 --> 02:17:34,187
Sometimes.

1677
02:17:38,515 --> 02:17:42,986
There was once a king, and a queen.

1678
02:18:08,012 --> 02:18:09,582
Greetings, madam.

1679
02:18:09,847 --> 02:18:13,260
Glory to... - Madhvi Devi!

1680
02:18:13,350 --> 02:18:14,920
Today, you've all gathered here...

1681
02:18:15,019 --> 02:18:17,397
for Aditya Pratap
Singh's birthday.

1682
02:18:17,488 --> 02:18:20,025
And I'm grateful for that.

1683
02:18:20,457 --> 02:18:22,801
When will Aditya Pratap
Singh be released?

1684
02:18:22,893 --> 02:18:26,500
I wish he was here right now.

1685
02:18:26,597 --> 02:18:30,272
Glory to... - Madhvi Devi!

1686
02:18:30,367 --> 02:18:33,974
Glory to... - Madhvi Devi!

1687
02:18:34,071 --> 02:18:39,282
Glory to... - Madhvi Devi!

1688
02:18:42,379 --> 02:18:44,450
Take me in your arms...

1689
02:18:44,949 --> 02:18:50,627
this beautiful moment
might not come again.

1690
02:18:55,159 --> 02:18:57,366
Madam, you have four more
meetings scheduled for today.

1691
02:18:57,594 --> 02:19:00,040
If you want I can confirm with them.

1692
02:19:00,264 --> 02:19:01,265
Yes madam.

1693
02:19:01,365 --> 02:19:03,038
Conference room is in the left side.

1694
02:19:03,133 --> 02:19:09,982
'Why do I always get men,
why not a poet?'
