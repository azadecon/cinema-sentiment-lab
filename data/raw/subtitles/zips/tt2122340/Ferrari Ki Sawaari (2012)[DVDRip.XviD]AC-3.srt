1
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:47,647
Life is a bouquet of oranges,
bright and fresh

2
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:54,623
if sprinkled with laughter...
Plump with sweetness

3
00:01:56,683 --> 00:02:01,428
Each week passes
light-fooled and easy

4
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:08,862
Each day dawns like
a Sunday morning

5
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,776
Woven with threads of such joy

6
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:17,906
Sparkles a story

7
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,419
its scent carried by the breeze

8
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,921
its melody whistled by the wind

9
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:44,532
In the white midday sun,
a golden spot of sunset

10
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:51,548
No time for gloom,
we cherish every happiness

11
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:58,416
Pockets full of small gestures
and big moments

12
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:06,092
No shroud of worry
we swirl in robes of content

13
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,601
Woven with threads of this spirit

14
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,896
Sparkles a story

15
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,075
its scent carried by the breeze

16
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,444
its melody whistled by the wind

17
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,651
Thank you for your help, sir

18
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,855
Life flows on

19
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:43,497
Whispering a new-old song...

20
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,700
In a blink and a sigh, I'm gone

21
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,641
Celebrate each moment,
together; hereon

22
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,177
Woven with threads of
our togetherness

23
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,621
Sparkles a story

24
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,591
its scent carried by the breeze

25
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,988
Well fielded, Kayoze

26
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,188
They say Catches win Matches

27
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,961
And Kayo's catch has certainly
turned the game around

28
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,132
Move

29
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,031
Not out, sir

30
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,036
My foot was on the line, sir

31
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,700
Sir, when I took the catch...

32
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,877
my foot was on the boundary line

33
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,279
C'mon guys, chin up

34
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,720
Papa, you know how well
I played today?

35
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:44,927
I took 7 wickets

36
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,724
You're listening, Papa?
- Listening, Kayo

37
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,533
The ball was high but far

38
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,766
Iran real fast to the ball...
and I dived

39
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,096
Fantastic
- And catch

40
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:56,730
Papa, that was a red light

41
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,900
Oh no

42
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,669
Sorry son
- No Papa, I'm sorry

43
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,940
Do you see a traffic cop?

44
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,283
No Papa, no one

45
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,745
How could you, Rusy...
I'm sorry

46
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,087
Bhau Waghmare'...
What sort of name is that?

47
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,324
Good morning, sir

48
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:22,258
Yes?

49
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,966
Sir, I ran a red light.
May I pay the fine please?

50
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,162
You didn't pay the
traffic cop there?

51
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,231
There wasn't anyone there

52
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,870
So who stopped you?

53
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,873
No one stopped me

54
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,314
You say you ran a red light

55
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:39,943
No cop there

56
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,745
So you should have left.
No big deal

57
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,088
No one saw you

58
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,622
Someone saw me

59
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:47,722
Who saw you?

60
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,324
My son saw me

61
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,854
He will learn from what I do

62
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,994
I ran a red light,
I must pay the fine

63
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:58,067
Bylaw, I can't take your fine

64
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,794
Please leave

65
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,932
Here's another headache

66
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:08,043
Stop there.
Don't offload that car

67
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,268
C'mon, get the car down

68
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,615
Inspector Mhatre, I told you...

69
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,014
Don't tow any imported car
in this area

70
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,950
It could belong to a politician

71
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,982
This car caused a
2 km long traffic jam

72
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,087
They park wrongly, we suffer

73
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:24,752
Inspector Mhatre,
please listen to me

74
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:28,026
One scratch on this car
means a big enquiry

75
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,725
Do you know how
expensive this car is?

76
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,698
Rs. 10.2 million -
cost in Mumbai

77
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,395
BMW 7 series, latest model

78
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,138
Sir, please take this fine

79
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,207
This is... '?
- The King of Honesty

80
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,899
Meet the Champion of Truth

81
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,204
One moment, sir

82
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,644
Remember?
- Of course!

83
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,775
Rustom Behram Deboo.
Head Clerk, Transport Office

84
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,920
Nandkumar Mhatre.
Inspector, Traffic

85
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:54,648
And - my son
Kayoze Rustom Deboo

86
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,688
Shinde, this man is amazing

87
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,683
A boon for the traffic police

88
00:06:58,684 --> 00:06:59,719
Imagine that

89
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,857
He cleared that Ballard Pier jam
single-handedly

90
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,422
Wow

91
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:03,664
Don't harass him

92
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,359
No, never

93
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,864
Here, let me gift you
these blank tickets

94
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,009
Next time, write yourself a ticket

95
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,177
Sir, take the fine please

96
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,940
Shinde
- Got it, sir

97
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,174
Proud to meet you, Mr. Deboo

98
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,307
Thank you, sir

99
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:22,719
But sir...

100
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,114
What was your name now...

101
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:29,019
Rustom Behram Deboo.
Head Clerk, Transport Office

102
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,915
Rusy

103
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,058
Yes Papa?

104
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,129
Where are those noodles-shoodles?

105
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,128
Ready Papa, almost ready

106
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,130
Grate some cheese over them

107
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,257
Yes Papa

108
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,343
Let's watch some cricket, Grandpa

109
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,872
They're not cricketers,
they're salesmen

110
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,276
They sell soaps and pomades

111
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,852
Ever heard of Don Bradman
selling fragrant hair gel?

112
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,247
Now buzz off, weasel

113
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,391
Always knocking that ball

114
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,192
Papa, Grandpa is so mean

115
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,833
Let it go Kayo, it's ok

116
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,271
If he hates Indian cricketers,
why does he live in India?

117
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,004
What's that, weasel?

118
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,202
Nothing, Papa

119
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,145
Kayo, you don't speak
to your elders like that

120
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,380
Go, say sorry

121
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,850
Kayo

122
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,879
Sorry

123
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,087
Papa, your noodles

124
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,120
Too hot

125
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,395
Sorry

126
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,834
Added cheese?
- Yes Papa

127
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,268
Ginger and garlic?
- Yes Papa

128
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,497
And Mr. Kayo,
here are your shoodles

129
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,849
Last night I had a dream

130
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:39,881
I was at Lord's, watching
the Cricket World Cup final

131
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,089
India vs. Pakistan

132
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:47,558
Last 2 overs, India needs
30 runs to win

133
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,858
At the non-striker end is
Sachin Tendulkar

134
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,036
At the striker's end is...
Guess who, Kayo?

135
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,133
Guess...

136
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,166
Kayo?

137
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,167
Give up?

138
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,841
At the striker's end is
Kayoze Rustom Deboo...

139
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,105
Captain of the Indian Cricket team

140
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,907
Shoab Akhtar bowls at
5600 km/ hour

141
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,176
And Kayo easily flicks him...

142
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:08,241
That... was a wide ball

143
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,281
Last ball now

144
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,923
6 runs to win

145
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,192
All fielders at boundary

146
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,384
Bowler runs

147
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,864
Kayo lifts his bat up

148
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,196
Crowd chants...

149
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:26,132
North, South, East, West...
Kayoze is the best

150
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:30,934
Kayo... Kayo...

151
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:34,069
Bowler bowls and
Kayo swings his bat

152
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,114
Of all the witless, idiotic...

153
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,064
Kayo

154
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:59,024
Made the TV into a punching bag

155
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,003
Were you batting or battering?

156
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,644
Kayo... Kayo...'

157
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,572
Need a kick on your butt

158
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,981
I'm sorry, Kayo

159
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,574
There's a match tomorrow.
What do I do?

160
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,477
Sue him in the High Court

161
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,350
Now you'll say -
Look at the brighter side of life

162
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,586
Actually yes, Kayo

163
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,555
What if it had broken
during the match?

164
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,166
Listen, we'll buy
a new bat tomorrow

165
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,929
Remember the bat we'd
put a red mark on?

166
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,032
We'll buy that

167
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:39,137
But that's for Rs. 2800

168
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,202
So what? I'll get it for you

169
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:46,641
The match is at 9 am
but the shop opens at 9:30

170
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,717
You play one down, right?

171
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,052
I'll get it before your turn

172
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:53,479
Are you sure?

173
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,384
Sure

174
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,389
One moment

175
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,495
What're you looking at, Kayo?
- Nothing

176
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:01,962
Shoes?
- No Papa

177
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:46,769
Goodnight my angel,
now close your eyes

178
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:54,414
Goodnight love,
hush those sleepy sighs

179
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,483
Let the moon lull you

180
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:02,351
into a gentle web of dreams

181
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:06,360
As the night croons along with me

182
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,327
Goodnight

183
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,618
Excuse me, sir.
Does this shop open at 9130?

184
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,754
That's what it says here

185
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,562
Don't know when it actually opens

186
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,792
Welcome, everyone, to the
Mumbai University Ground...

187
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,666
and the Young
Mumbai Indians Tournament

188
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,468
First ball of the innings

189
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,406
And that's clean bowled.
Great delivery

190
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,712
Next batsman is Kayoze...

191
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,180
their captain and
their best batsman

192
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:06,380
Sahil, go

193
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,350
Sir?

194
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,282
Go, I said

195
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,552
Captain, what's your batting order?

196
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,384
Sir, I'll go two down

197
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,160
Slow down, you'll trip

198
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,360
A few days back I was
here with my son

199
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,701
We'd put a red mark
on a bat, remember?

200
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,932
Which bat?

201
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,307
There're 2000 bats here.
Where will you look?

202
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,435
Howzzat?

203
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,946
Huge appeal. And the
umpire raises his finger

204
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,208
Go, Kayo

205
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,611
Ball's keeping low, watch it

206
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,480
PTVA score -
27 for 2 wickets

207
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,519
Sir, my bat broke yesterday

208
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,417
So borrow one

209
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,294
But Papa's getting me a new bat

210
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,353
I'll go three down

211
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:54,960
Nawaz

212
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,663
I told you to keep that bat aside

213
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,261
Which bat? How will I know?

214
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,838
Go look inside

215
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,362
Oh yes, there too

216
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,669
Keep this
- What is it?

217
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,708
Money

218
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,879
Now he'll attempt the impossible

219
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,944
An easy catch

220
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:21,315
PTVA score -
32 for 3 wickets

221
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,492
That was close

222
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,299
9... 10... 11 Found it?

223
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,700
No, still looking

224
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,769
It's not going to wait around
for so many days

225
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,004
What now?

226
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,510
Yes

227
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,750
Sir, if the next wicket falls
and Papa's still not here...

228
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,252
I'll go to bat

229
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:53,652
OK

230
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:54,721
Please hurry

231
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:57,020
First you tire me,
then you hurry me

232
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,584
I'm sorry

233
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,998
How much for this,
after the discount?

234
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,858
If you give me 100 rupee bills,
then 1500 rupees

235
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,305
If you give me coins like this,
then 1700 rupees

236
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,468
Right. I'll mark it.
Keep it aside

237
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,013
Next ball

238
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,314
He tried to step out and play...

239
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,644
and he's out

240
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,013
Brilliant stumping

241
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,615
Shut your mouth
- The over ends

242
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,289
Manmeet, bat

243
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,524
Sure?

244
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:41,365
Kayo... Kayo...

245
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,811
Finally on field is
Kayoze Rustom Deboo

246
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,872
Score is 70 for 6 wickets.
Just 7 overs left

247
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:55,315
They need 9 runs per over.
That's a tough one

248
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:59,413
But if there's Kayo,
there's hope for his team

249
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:05,388
Next ball

250
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,964
Ajinkya plays it superbly
to leg side

251
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,363
Could be 2 runs

252
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,729
Kayo takes 1 run.
He's running for the 2nd

253
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,427
He's running...
- Sir, 1 minute

254
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,494
He's running...

255
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,705
Still running...

256
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,000
He's just running...

257
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,571
He's running off the field

258
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,720
Quick Papa, please

259
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,596
Sorry I'm late, son
- it's ok, Papa

260
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,558
Yes, this is it.
Bye Papa

261
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:46,666
Kayo

262
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:47,937
One moment

263
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,770
Wearing your guard?
- Papa, not here

264
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,137
All the best
- Bye Papa

265
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,805
Here goes...

266
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,470
He's off

267
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:58,938
Watch now

268
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,514
All set

269
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,551
All wired

270
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,110
C'mon Kayo, hit

271
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,620
All alert

272
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,385
In position

273
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:08,918
Revved to go...

274
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,822
In to battle

275
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,075
He's hit a 6...

276
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,741
Ana' now a 4

277
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,004
Something zooms up. . .
Look, it's our score!

278
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,051
He's hit a 6...

279
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,779
Ana' now a 4

280
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,550
Something zooms up. . .
Look, it's our score!

281
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,521
The crowds hunger for runs. . .
They gotta have more

282
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,757
More...

283
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,833
And more...

284
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,458
He hits

285
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:53,796
Watch out

286
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,605
Up and a way

287
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,430
A big hit

288
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:14,014
PTVA needs 2 runs off the last ball

289
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,221
Last ball.
Kayo played it to leg side

290
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:19,619
Slight misfield

291
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,632
He's taken 1 run
and runs for the 2nd

292
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,834
There's a throw from the boundary

293
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,530
Kayo needs to hurry

294
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,043
Howzzat?

295
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,318
Alright everyone,
your attention please

296
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,284
Excuse me

297
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:58,954
Thank you

298
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,856
I'd like to introduce you all
to John McClan...

299
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,796
cricket coach from MCG, London

300
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:06,930
John and his team are here
to select Under-14 players...

301
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,038
for a cricket camp

302
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,264
The selected players will go to...

303
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:12,841
Guess where?

304
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:16,269
To the Mecca of cricket, yes...

305
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,815
Lord's cricket ground, London

306
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,151
So... Over to you, John

307
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:25,314
Thank you

308
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,119
Now listen carefully

309
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:31,286
The MCG is conducting a
coaching camp and a tournament...

310
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,061
for Under-14 players

311
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,796
We will select 10 players
from every country

312
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:38,924
He's upset?

313
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,170
A little

314
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:44,266
Rusy, this is an extraordinary camp

315
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,132
But it costs Rs.150,000

316
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,773
See, Kayo's the best we have

317
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:53,311
I don't want him to feel
he's losing a great opportunity

318
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,217
So I'll convince him
he doesn't need this camp

319
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:57,752
He'll understand

320
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,052
Don't worry, I'll handle him.
I'll just be back

321
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,388
The 11th player is an
international level cricketer

322
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,160
And here's the best part...

323
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:09,155
This means you could be
facing Shane Warne

324
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,324
Or...

325
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,136
perhaps bowling to...

326
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,999
Sachin Tendulkar

327
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,041
This is important,
so please listen carefully

328
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,971
The final selection is in 2 weeks

329
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:30,683
If selected, you must pay
the fee the next day

330
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,382
Jeet, forms

331
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:36,855
Hey

332
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:38,855
Hello

333
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,362
Good job, Captain

334
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:43,357
Cheer up

335
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,732
I'll see you at Lord's

336
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:21,771
Saurabh, especially for you.
Don't forget..

337
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,099
Excuse me, sir

338
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,971
May I have a form, please?

339
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:30,905
Are you sure?

340
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,778
Yes sir. The form, please

341
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:46,758
Papa

342
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,965
But Papa, how will we
get the money?

343
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:54,361
EPF

344
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,500
What is EPF?

345
00:24:56,828 --> 00:25:00,037
Employees Provident Fund.
The Government's piggy bank

346
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:03,404
Every month, we put a bit of
our salary into it

347
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:06,749
The Government also puts in
the same amount

348
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,874
And when we need a loan...

349
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,920
like we need one now, for Lord's...

350
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,453
we can take it from the piggy bank

351
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,052
But if we can't unlock
the piggy bank...

352
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,995
do we break it, Papa?

353
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,060
Thank you, Papa

354
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,905
Long live the Government of India

355
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,811
Rusy, I'll sign this...

356
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,174
but I doubt you'll get
your loan in 15 days

357
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,181
Sir, if you recommend...

358
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,820
That won't help

359
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,114
Good morning, Mr. Kadam

360
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:49,951
Hey Babbu didi

361
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:54,025
Rusy, how're you? All good?

362
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,162
All good, thank you

363
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,028
Do carry on with your work

364
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:03,371
Last year, I applied for a loan
for my daughter's wedding

365
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:04,966
The wedding went off well

366
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,237
Babbu didi was the wedding planner

367
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,534
I still owe her money

368
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,004
Never mind that

369
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,476
Now, when my daughter
had a baby, I got a letter

370
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:17,308
Glad to sanction you a loan
for your daughter's marriage'

371
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:21,053
What's this?

372
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,589
Rice pudding for you

373
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,487
Do have some, Rusy

374
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,185
Some tea?

375
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,125
No, I don't feel like it

376
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,492
Something bothering you?

377
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:32,300
I'm looking for a car

378
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,297
See this picture

379
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:39,932
Ferrari Italia, 562 horsepower.
Top speed 320 km/ hour

380
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:42,370
Costs Rs. 34.6 million in Mumbai

381
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:43,477
Very good car

382
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,881
He knows every detail

383
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,141
That's amazing

384
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,613
You know every detail

385
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,487
Now tell me,
where will I get this car?

386
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:55,516
No one here has this model

387
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,420
Really? Any similar models?

388
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,394
Sachin Tendulkar has one

389
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:04,228
Our Tendulkar?

390
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,096
This is great news

391
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:07,168
Will he rent it to us?

392
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:10,033
I'll give him any deal he wants

393
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,368
Per km/ per second...
whatever he wants

394
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,636
And I'll return it with a full tank

395
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:19,381
Babbu didi, life is treating
him great right now

396
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,244
He doesn't need to rent out his cars

397
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,511
Then this sister of yours
is as good as dead

398
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,950
Tell me, why does it have
to be a Ferrari?

399
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,091
Because of my stupidity

400
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,455
Do you know of Tatiya Mandke?

401
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:36,064
He's a big shot politician
from the Worli village

402
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:37,925
His son's getting married
- Sir, I'll get back

403
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,635
What's the matter?
Don't like my tragic tale?

404
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,166
Stay and listen. I'm not done

405
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,639
So, Tatiya's son is to be married.
To impress him, I said...

406
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,203
It's your son's wedding

407
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:50,673
We'll do it Rome style

408
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,347
I was on a roll. I said...

409
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,112
Instead of riding the
traditional solitary horse...

410
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:59,278
your son will ride 560 horses
at his wedding

411
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:00,684
Tatiya said - How?

412
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,389
I said - In the Ferrari

413
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,561
The signature red car of Italy,
the Ferrari

414
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,258
560 horsepower

415
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:08,626
The thug took me seriously

416
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,992
He wants 560 horsepower
at the wedding

417
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,067
And I'm trapped

418
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,470
Hello

419
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,972
Yes, this is Babbu Chanchal...

420
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,133
Proprietor,
Chanchal Wedding Planners

421
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:21,035
Hello ma'am

422
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,270
Your name's been selected
for a personal loan

423
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,544
Interested, ma'am?

424
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,976
Give your mom a loan,
I don't need one

425
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,277
I need a Ferrari. Have one?

426
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,145
Silly loan peddlers

427
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,949
Since I bought this phone,
I only get loan offers

428
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,090
I'm fed up. Mark my words...

429
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,318
Loan for you'

430
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:40,052
We'll hear this on the streets soon

431
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:42,665
Go ahead, laugh at my misery

432
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,193
Truly, this is a big
business deal for me

433
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:48,566
Please try and get me
a Ferrari. Save my life

434
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,031
Or that goon will shoot me

435
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:23,731
Opera

436
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,404
It's the music of Rome

437
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:30,476
At our Pakya's wedding,
everything will be Rome style

438
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,676
Everything. Why?

439
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:36,177
Because Rome is the Capital of Love

440
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:43,619
Rani, your prince won't ride
to you on a horse

441
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:48,497
He'll zip to you in
the Roman car, Ferrari

442
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,568
Every bridegroom has
1 horsepower under his butt

443
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:57,537
But Pakya will have
560 horsepower under his butt

444
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,098
Great idea, Babbu didi

445
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,077
I have another idea

446
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:05,275
Babbu didi, no more ideas

447
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,208
The Ferrari's final

448
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,542
Dad, I want the Ferrari

449
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,244
All yours, son

450
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,648
Hit it, guys

451
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:19,126
The Ferrari £9 coming here

452
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:22,097
Pakya 's big day is near

453
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:00,491
What's the number?
- What?

454
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:03,297
Yes Papa, it's...

455
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,412
Papa, it rang

456
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,247
So answer it

457
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,521
Hello Papa

458
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,520
Hello

459
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,283
Papa, can you hear me?

460
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,259
Dimwit, here I can hear
even without the phone

461
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,697
Go farther away
- Sorry, one moment

462
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,134
Hello... Papa, now?

463
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,143
Still getting your voice directly

464
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,811
Hide elsewhere

465
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:47,745
Can you hear me
on the phone now?

466
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,150
No, it's the same. Go farther

467
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:51,513
From here?

468
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,812
Go behind the door
- OK

469
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,320
But Papa, can you hear me
on the phone?

470
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,187
Or can you only hear me directly?

471
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:01,420
Papa?

472
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:02,358
Rusy

473
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,427
I have an idea

474
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,534
Go into the bathroom

475
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:09,794
OK, yes, that's it

476
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:11,663
Hold on Papa, one moment

477
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:15,940
What a cartoon character

478
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,443
Hello. This is
Rustom Behram Deboo...

479
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,413
Head Clerk, Transport Office.
Who's speaking please?

480
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:22,709
Your pop

481
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,711
You bought a phone
to just chit-chat?

482
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,187
No Papa, I heard that
cell phones owners...

483
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,622
get loan offers from banks

484
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:32,252
What loan?

485
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,390
Papa

486
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,396
I want to send Kayo
to London, Papa

487
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:44,637
Why?

488
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,364
Papa

489
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,344
MCG cricket camp at Lord's

490
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:53,314
To send Kayo to London,
you'll take out a loan?

491
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,209
Papa, Kayo's an excellent cricketer

492
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:57,886
With the right training,
he'll play for India some day

493
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,517
I know Rs. 150,000 is a lot...

494
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,517
Have you lost your mind?

495
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,258
To send Kayo to London,
you'll take out a 150,000 loan?

496
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,795
In no time it'll be 300,000,
then a million

497
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:10,898
How will you pay it back?

498
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,461
You'll sell this house?

499
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,237
You'll put us on the street?

500
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,800
Don't you dare stuff
his head with trash

501
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,014
Now hang up.
Can't you hear me directly?

502
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,851
Stupid idiot

503
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:38,691
Papa, Kayo...

504
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,893
Go on, get out

505
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,366
Get him to finish school

506
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:45,593
Then teach him water-proofing

507
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:47,769
Mumbai homes are always leaking

508
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,972
You want to take him
to Lord's on that scooter?

509
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,698
Goodnight Pa pa

510
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,006
What is so good
about the night?

511
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,338
Stuff your Goodnight

512
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:03,344
Can barely find his way
within Mumbai...

513
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,747
and wants to go to Lord's!

514
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:22,059
Papa, should I speak
to him or will you?

515
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,630
Kayo, you're still awake?

516
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:24,502
Where're you going?

517
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,599
What're you doing, Kayo?

518
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,303
He's always so rude to you

519
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:30,640
If Mama was here,
this wouldn't happen

520
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,612
Kayo, I can't fight with Grandpa

521
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:35,078
And Mama wouldn't have, either

522
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:38,546
She would've scolded him
- No son, she wouldn't have

523
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:39,687
Why not?

524
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,655
When I grow up, I'll show him

525
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,783
Let me go, Papa

526
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,526
I'm sorry, Papa

527
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,702
It's ok. Come here

528
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,612
Kayo, many years ago...

529
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,786
there were two friends...

530
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:14,880
just like you and Sahil

531
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:21,927
Their passion was also cricket

532
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,831
Like you both, they broke
windows all the time

533
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,668
Both had the same dream...

534
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,505
To play for India some day

535
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,381
At the age of 14,
they played interstate cricket

536
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:49,982
They made centuries together,
were an unbeatable partnership

537
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:54,723
Finally, both were called for
the Indian team selection

538
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:59,157
Rumor had it only one of them
would make it to the team

539
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:00,968
Oh no... Then?

540
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,965
Then jealousy crept in

541
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,705
On the day of selection,
both played superbly

542
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,107
Every ball was hit for a 4 or 6

543
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:15,679
It was the drinks break

544
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,650
And one friend
betrayed the friendship

545
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,489
Then?

546
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:40,937
It was a bouncer.
He couldn't see it clearly

547
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:48,645
The glass damaged his cornea

548
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:54,179
He was left with some vision,
but couldn't play cricket again

549
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,689
And the other friend?

550
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,120
He was selected to the Indian team

551
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:03,930
Became rich and famous,
traveled the world

552
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:07,132
He never came to meet his friend?

553
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,233
No, never

554
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,135
Who's he, Papa?
Do I know him?

555
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,206
Dharmadhikari

556
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,205
Dilip Dharmadhikari?

557
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,219
The world knows
D. N. Dharmadhikari

558
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:27,655
But his friend...

559
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:31,625
was forgotten long ago

560
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,057
Where is he now, Papa?

561
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,800
You're crying, Papa?

562
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,217
He's in our living room

563
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,648
Grandpa?

564
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:40,854
Kayo?

565
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:42,990
Was he the best?

566
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,695
He was the bestest

567
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:10,188
May this mind...

568
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:15,154
its thoughts and deeds

569
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:20,063
Every stride and step

570
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:24,933
Tread the path of Truth

571
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:30,005
Truth and Integrity . .

572
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:34,977
Make for a tough path

573
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:39,881
But remain fearless
and unwavering

574
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:43,853
Always, with head held high

575
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,825
Stand strong...

576
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:54,763
On the tough, honest path

577
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:59,771
Ana' remain fearless
and unwavering

578
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:03,104
Always, with head held high

579
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:14,179
...Lord's, London. So, I need a loan

580
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,725
Sorry, not possible

581
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,167
Good morning, ma'am
- Good morning

582
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,035
I'd like to meet
a loan officer, please

583
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,737
He's here

584
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:41,805
Good morning, sir

585
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,039
My name is Rustom Behram Deboo...

586
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,212
Head Clerk, Transport Office

587
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:46,847
You didn't call me,
so I've come over

588
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:48,021
I was going to call you?

589
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:51,691
I have a new phone, you see.

590
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:52,686
So?

591
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,253
So I thought you'd call me
with a loan offer

592
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:56,356
It's ok, sir

593
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,833
Sir, my son,
Kayoze Rustom Deboo...

594
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,256
is an outstanding cricketer

595
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:02,134
He plays one down and
never returns to the pavilion

596
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,397
He's been selected for
a cricket camp at Lord's

597
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:05,105
So, sir?

598
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:08,076
Sir, the camp's a bit expensive,
so I need a loan

599
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,968
Sir, one moment

600
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:11,842
Sir, see Kayo's certificates

601
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,243
Sir, this is for Man of the Match

602
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,771
This for Highest Scorer

603
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,183
Sir, for fielding too

604
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,446
Sir, see his medals and trophies

605
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:20,746
This is for Man of the Match

606
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,724
This is for batting... fielding...

607
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,387
One last thing
I want to show you, sir

608
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,229
His medals, sir

609
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,368
Sir, if you see him play...

610
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,402
I'm sure you'll approve the loan

611
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,170
Can I see your
salary slips, please?

612
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:40,003
Yes, I have them here

613
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:43,905
Transport Office?

614
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,112
Head Clerk, sir

615
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,047
How much money do you need?

616
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,941
RS. 'I 50,000, Sir

617
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,017
Sorry, you're not eligible
- I know that, sir

618
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,815
You can't get a loan
on this salary

619
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:55,448
I know that, sir

620
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,759
Sir, that's why...

621
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:00,159
I've got you his
certificates and trophies

622
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:01,821
Sir, look at Kayo's talent

623
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,761
OK, how much can I get
with my salary?

624
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:04,764
135,000?

625
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:06,260
125,0007

626
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:11,194
Sir, if a father's salary is low,
can his son never move up?

627
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,037
Please leave

628
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:14,201
Why would anyone with
a fat salary want a loan?

629
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,433
Only someone who has
less money will come to you

630
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,200
Security

631
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,078
Sir, see his caliber and decide

632
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,149
Come to the club once
and see him bat

633
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:22,477
Sir, he's wonderful

634
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:23,508
Sir?

635
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:25,350
Sir...

636
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,563
Give him this. Tell him to
remember this name

637
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,032
He'll be on TV some day

638
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,209
As he hits a sixer,
all of India will clap for him

639
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:50,211
And your boss will smack
his head in frustration

640
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:52,211
Have a good day

641
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:57,081
Smack his head?
He'll crack his skull

642
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,115
I tell you, Rusy...

643
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:03,088
he'll suffer so much,
he'll commit suicide

644
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,860
Don't stress. Don't let
this spoil your mood

645
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,121
We'll find another way

646
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:14,494
Mr. Kadam mentioned that
your father, Behram Deboo...

647
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:16,869
played interstate cricket

648
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:19,539
Yes, he was the youngest
interstate player

649
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:23,475
That's wonderful

650
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,608
Like grandfather, like grandson

651
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:29,279
Cricket runs in your blood

652
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,584
You didn't give it a shot?

653
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,143
Actually, I...

654
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:37,284
That's alright. Cricket's loss,
Transport Office's gain

655
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,552
You know, relationships
don't mean anything today

656
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:46,000
But one bond is still strong -
the bond of cricket

657
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:49,467
It got me thinking

658
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:54,101
Your papa can tell Sachin -
There's a family wedding

659
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:57,041
Give me your Ferrari for 2 days

660
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,543
How will Sachin refuse him?

661
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:03,475
Papa won't...

662
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,011
OK, imagine this

663
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:07,248
Sachin asks your papa...

664
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:09,390
Can I borrow Rusy's scooter
for 2 days?

665
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,585
Your papa will never refuse him

666
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:14,255
That's the bond of cricket

667
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:17,991
Yes, but Papa won't...

668
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:21,101
OK now let me explain
what's in it for you

669
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,271
Come closer

670
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:27,969
You speak to your papa...

671
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:30,405
and get me Sachin's Ferrari
for 2 days

672
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:33,548
In return, I'll give you
Rs. 150,000

673
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:35,075
A gift, for you

674
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:38,580
I'm a Government employee.
I can't accept gifts

675
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,955
Ma'am, I've to leave now,
if you don't mind

676
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,450
Sorry, I've to go,
if you don't mind

677
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,221
Our Kayo will go to London, Rusy

678
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:50,363
Ma'am, what...

679
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,031
Don't worry about it

680
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,668
Go about your business

681
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:56,060
Listen to me calmly

682
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:58,103
You know the proverb...

683
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:01,071
Opportunity knocks your door once'?

684
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,370
Look, once this wedding's over...

685
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,346
you'll lose your chance of
sending Kayo to London

686
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:07,607
I'm at your door, ringing the bell

687
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:09,075
Ding dong

688
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:11,149
But you've locked yourself in

689
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,048
Unlock the door
- Look lady...

690
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,679
Got a problem, Grandpa?

691
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:16,524
There's a lady here

692
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,051
Go on, now. Do your thing

693
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,286
Open the door, let me in

694
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,557
Take the Opportunity

695
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:23,960
What do you say?

696
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:26,067
Well?

697
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:30,628
Ma'am, give me some time.
I'll talk to Papa

698
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:47,118
Papa

699
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:49,145
Sachin's making a century.
Come and see

700
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:50,146
OK, in a while

701
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:51,080
Now, Papa

702
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,458
I have some work.
I'II join you, son

703
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:53,526
Sixer

704
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,061
Bye Papa. See you

705
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:00,658
Hello?

706
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,636
Wrong number

707
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,301
Hey Mr. Popular
- Yes?

708
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:09,502
Your social circle's expanding.
Who was it?

709
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:11,204
Wrong number, Papa

710
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:13,673
You get dirty jokes or not?

711
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:15,781
Wrong number, I said

712
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,384
Always been a wrong number

713
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:25,583
Hello?

714
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:35,534
Babbu didi,
Sachin knows me very well

715
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,767
Don't you worry, I'll handle it

716
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:42,736
I will speak to Rusy

717
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,808
I'm his father,
he has to listen to me

718
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:54,551
And when this is done,
you must visit us

719
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:58,049
Yes, I'll speak to Rusy right away

720
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:00,091
See you soon

721
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:03,754
Rusy, you didn't tell me...

722
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:06,461
you're getting Rs. 150,000
for Sachin's Ferrari

723
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:07,728
No Papa, I told Babbu didi...

724
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:12,140
Listen, don't you want Kayo
to be a cricketer?

725
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:15,777
Pull up a chair. Sit down

726
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:18,204
Listen carefully

727
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:24,617
This is what you must do -
Go to Sachin's house and say...

728
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:27,520
I am the son of Behram Deboo'

729
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:29,313
You must understand...

730
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:32,720
the bond of cricket is stronger
than any other bond

731
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:35,424
Sachin doesn't drive
that car anyway

732
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:38,665
It's rotting in his garage

733
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,698
Papa, you're not fooling
with me, are you?

734
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,667
Would I fool with you
on something like this?

735
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,678
What's wrong with you?

736
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:55,277
My dear Rustom...

737
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:26,503
Good morning,
Mrs. Sachin Tendulkar

738
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:30,912
How do I address her?

739
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,782
Good morning, Mrs. Tendulkar

740
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:40,288
Very good. Continue

741
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:42,651
You know Tatiya Mandke,
the politician?

742
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:44,290
His son's getting married

743
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:47,554
For the wedding,
Tatiya wants his son to be in a...

744
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:49,228
Ferrari

745
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:50,693
What a fine idea

746
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:55,901
He's a very caring father

747
00:49:56,226 --> 00:50:00,299
So I thought we could...
both... help him

748
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:02,305
You see, you have 3-4 cars

749
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,709
If you can lend one of them...

750
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,279
like the Ferrari...

751
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:09,713
say the Ferrari...

752
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,377
to Mr. Mandke for a few hours...

753
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,510
he'll pay me Rs. 150,000 for it...

754
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:17,014
and Kayo can go to Lord's

755
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,327
Any chance, Mrs. Tendulkar?

756
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,258
Very good. Smile

757
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:48,988
Hello?

758
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,286
Hello Rusy, any luck?

759
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:53,588
You spoke to Papa?

760
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:55,955
I have the Ferrari key
in my hand

761
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:59,358
What? Seriously?

762
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,026
You're a hero

763
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,425
Actually, someone at the house...

764
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,406
probably thought
I was the car cleaner

765
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,665
Gave me all the car keys

766
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,631
I haven't mentioned
the wedding yet

767
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:10,433
I'll speak about it and call you

768
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:11,936
Wait, don't

769
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:15,043
You got the car key
without asking for it

770
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:16,611
It's a sign from above

771
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,548
Just take the car and come here

772
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:21,577
What? No ma'am

773
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,854
That would be stealing.
I can't do that

774
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:25,583
Listen, do as I say

775
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:26,989
No one will get to know

776
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,792
It's a matter of a few hours

777
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:31,761
Once the wedding's over,
we'll return the car

778
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:33,663
I'm sorry ma'am,
I can't do this

779
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:36,805
Rusy, think of your
son's potential

780
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:39,496
He'll blossom at Lord's

781
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:42,399
Sachin played for India
at the age of 16

782
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:44,546
Your son will play at 12

783
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:45,975
Youngest player ever

784
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:49,408
Do your duty as a father

785
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:16,965
Sir, the latest bestsellers

786
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,172
No, thank you

787
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,769
Hey, nice wheels

788
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,675
No son, step back please

789
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,680
No, don't do that

790
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,983
Babbu didi, where should I
bring the Ferrari?

791
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:38,682
You did it, my tiger

792
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,122
This is great

793
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,754
Come into the Worli village

794
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:45,128
You'll see the
wedding festivities

795
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:46,626
Drive towards them

796
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:47,828
The Worli village?

797
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:49,095
OK

798
00:53:56,533 --> 00:54:01,607
The turmeric ceremony
of our beloved Pakya

799
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:02,975
Stop this

800
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,916
Mr. Mandke

801
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:11,250
Our Ferrari is coming hers

802
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:14,822
Pakya, smile if you want
your photo taken

803
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:16,825
560 horsepower

804
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:22,002
Our Ferrari is coming hers

805
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:27,800
What's the matter?

806
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:31,509
Let the Ferrari turn around
and go back

807
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,971
See what's written about me
in the paper

808
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,718
Public coffers empty,
Tatiya has plenty'

809
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:39,017
Oh no

810
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,612
Page 5 today,
front page news tomorrow

811
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:42,781
And that's the end of me

812
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:44,616
As you know...

813
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:49,524
there are more politicians
in prison than in power

814
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:55,530
Now here's my idea

815
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:58,930
I will tell the Press...

816
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:03,167
I'm spending money...

817
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:06,040
but not on my son's wedding

818
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:10,909
I'm arranging a Mass Wedding

819
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,286
Listen, all of you

820
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:14,915
Tomorrow, right here...

821
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:18,788
201 couples will be
married off by me

822
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:21,753
200 are my social work

823
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:23,995
1 is my...

824
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:26,167
homework

825
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,932
My son Prakash

826
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:33,298
He will wear a number
and pose for photos

827
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:36,969
Pakya

828
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:39,838
What's this number scam?

829
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,880
Each couple in a mass
wedding has a number

830
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:46,577
I will have '201' on me,
and so will my wife

831
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,087
If not, wives can get
switched around

832
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:49,088
Is that so?
- Yes

833
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:52,184
So you'll wear a number
and get married?

834
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:52,781
Yes

835
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,728
Man, you're our Crown Prince

836
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:56,152
Don't do it

837
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,896
Then Tatiya will be in the
Union Cabinet

838
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:03,935
I won't wear a number
around my neck

839
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:07,608
You will wear a number

840
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,174
You will marry the way I want

841
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:11,303
My friends will laugh at me

842
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,108
They'll mock me -
'Didn't get a Ferrari...

843
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:16,773
but wore a number plate
at his wedding'

844
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:18,611
I won't...

845
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:20,883
Forget this wedding. Cancel it

846
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,182
Cancel it, I don't care

847
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:24,155
I won't get married your way

848
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:26,318
But we've started
the turmeric ceremony

849
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,786
How can we cancel now?

850
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:29,657
Babbu didi, do something

851
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:31,992
Yes, just a moment, excuse me

852
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,157
Son, listen to me

853
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:37,032
You want to sit in the Ferrari,
take photos with your pals?

854
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:39,764
I'll make it happen for you.
Trust me

855
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:41,738
One moment, excuse me

856
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:43,973
Can I suggest a win-win
compromise, sir?

857
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,204
There's a ceremony
at the bride's house today

858
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:47,781
Let's go there in style

859
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:49,638
The boys can have
their fill of the Ferrari

860
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,740
They'll celebrate,
get their photos taken

861
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:52,685
In return, tomorrow...

862
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:57,122
Pakya will wear No. 201
and get married

863
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,757
What do you say?

864
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:00,727
Well?

865
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:02,091
Well, son?

866
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:05,755
One moment

867
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:08,897
They're kids

868
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:10,103
Compromise

869
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:14,038
Take the Ferrari or your dad
will put you on a tricycle

870
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:20,142
Because you're my father...

871
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,387
I'm ready to compromise

872
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:29,448
Hit it

873
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:44,403
Shambhu

874
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:46,932
Lazy bones... Watching TV?

875
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:49,101
Where's Shambhu?

876
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:50,436
Shambhu hasn't come in

877
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:52,742
He hasn't?
- Nope

878
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:54,847
So who took the car keys
from me today?

879
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,178
Shambhu has the day off

880
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:19,367
What's the matter, Mohan?

881
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:26,976
The car's been stolen

882
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,817
How can that be?

883
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,948
I saw the car leave today

884
00:58:32,408 --> 00:58:33,944
I opened the gate for it

885
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,487
You mean...

886
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:39,253
you let the thief go?

887
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:41,194
Don't try to trick me, Mohan

888
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:43,930
No one steals in broad daylight

889
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,996
The thief took the car
from under your nose

890
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:47,956
What were you doing?

891
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:49,061
Watching the match,
eating bananas

892
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,229
Big oaf

893
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:54,240
When a car enters the gate,
it's my responsibility

894
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,002
I ask...

895
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:59,211
Where do you want to go?
Whom do you want?

896
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:03,915
When a car leaves,
it's not my responsibility

897
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:05,481
I can't ask...

898
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,980
Where are you going?
Why are you going there?

899
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:09,313
I'll get beaten up

900
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:10,849
Spare me the details

901
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,323
Explain this to the
Residents' Committee

902
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:14,556
Not the Committee, please

903
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:16,158
Because of you, the car's gone

904
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:19,961
This is now a police matter
- No police, please

905
00:59:20,323 --> 00:59:22,394
I'll lose my status in the village

906
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,499
You'll lose your status
in the village?

907
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:28,004
So confess that
you aided the theft

908
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:30,335
But you gave the thief the key

909
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:34,037
How did the car key
leave the house?

910
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:37,212
You were alone at home

911
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,083
Boss and his wife are
out of town

912
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,287
The cops will catch you first

913
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,585
Let me explain this to the
Residents' Committee

914
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:50,320
Wait, please. Don't...

915
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:51,863
Don't make a big deal
out of it, man

916
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:52,829
Listen...

917
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:55,495
Only you and I know
the car's been stolen

918
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,571
Does anyone else know?
- No

919
00:59:57,994 --> 01:00:00,531
We can't go to the cops
or tell anyone about it

920
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:01,474
Got it?

921
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:03,510
If we stick together,
we're safe

922
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,071
If not, we're both sunk.
Got it?

923
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,543
Come, let's look for the car now

924
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:10,883
But Mohan, where do we look?

925
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:12,887
It's a red Ferrari-
hard to miss

926
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:15,154
It's here

927
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:17,120
The Ferrari's here

928
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:47,045
Babbu didi, I've a task for you

929
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:49,380
Turn the Ferrari into
a florist's delight

930
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:50,584
Sir?

931
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,960
Put so many flowers on it...

932
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:56,020
that one wouldn't know
if it's a Ferrari or...

933
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,492
a bullock cart

934
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:11,407
My Ferrari

935
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:18,483
Sir, not so close to the car

936
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:20,182
Sir, you'll scratch the car

937
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:22,951
Give me the Ferrari key
- Sir, where is Babbu didi?

938
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,317
Give me the car key

939
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,016
I'm sorry sir,
I can't give you the key

940
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,520
I will drive the car, sir

941
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:28,392
Sir

942
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:29,291
Sir, stay back

943
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:31,328
Sir, please step back

944
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:32,422
Babbu didi

945
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:33,662
What chaos

946
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:34,926
Ma'am

947
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,670
Please don't tell anyone
this is Sachin's car

948
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:37,392
OK

949
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:38,667
And only I will drive this car

950
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:41,506
And ma'am, I have to return
the car in a few hours

951
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:43,668
Don't worry. You handle it all

952
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,002
Here, put these flowers
on the car

953
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:47,145
Ferrari

954
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,210
The Ferrari key?
- Later

955
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:50,610
First clear the area

956
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,657
Your boss played
superbly yesterday

957
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:59,256
As I was saying,
Shamshu bhai...

958
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:03,459
I have a small problem.
I need your help

959
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,530
Anytime. I'm here to help

960
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:07,331
But you didn't keep your word

961
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:09,525
You'd promised me a photo
with your boss...

962
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:11,332
I'll get Boss here

963
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,598
You can pose with him
against any car

964
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:15,640
Seriously?

965
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:18,235
Sachin Tendulkar
will come here?

966
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:21,072
Of course. If I tell him that
Shamshu bhai, the garage owner...

967
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,147
is a big fan of his,
he won't refuse

968
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:26,682
Mohan, you've made my day.
Come on in

969
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,524
This is my friend, Mahavir Tambe

970
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,158
Pleased to meet you

971
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:35,458
He heads a huge
security guard force

972
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:37,395
We're here because...

973
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,597
his car's been stolen

974
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:43,665
A car stolen from the
Head of Security?

975
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,764
Bad days...

976
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:46,664
Easy, now

977
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:47,734
What car was it?

978
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,167
Alto
- Scorpio

979
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,706
Alto or Scorpio?

980
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:55,674
Business as usual, don't worry

981
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:56,775
Mohan

982
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:58,347
Both

983
01:02:58,708 --> 01:02:59,550
Both?

984
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:01,417
Both

985
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:03,281
You see...

986
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:05,186
we were driving along
in the Alto

987
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:06,415
It stalled

988
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,596
To tow it, we called
for a Scorpio

989
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:12,255
Actually, we were in the
Scorpio, the Alto came...

990
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:14,429
You're explaining?

991
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:16,327
No, you go ahead

992
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:19,599
So, the Alto stalled

993
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:22,372
We got the Scorpio to tow it

994
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:26,311
As we were towing it,
he wanted to go

995
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:27,570
Go?
- Nature's call

996
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:30,115
We went to the side of the road

997
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:32,080
The thief sat in the Scorpio

998
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:35,355
He left in the Scorpio,
dragging the Alto with it

999
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:37,588
Steal one, get one free

1000
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,195
I want to know,
Shamshu bhai...

1001
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:45,295
The Alto, Scorpio and
other stolen cars...

1002
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,627
Where do they go?

1003
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:53,363
Scorpios go to
Bihar, U.P. or Nepal

1004
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:56,243
And the Alto?
- The Alto...

1005
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:59,075
Forget the Alto, Shamshu bhai

1006
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:00,741
Mr. Tambe can afford
many such cars

1007
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:03,243
Yes, I can

1008
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:04,540
May I speak now?

1009
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:09,215
I'm just curious...
Can I ask you a question?

1010
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:10,254
Ask away

1011
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,491
When a big car is stolen...

1012
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:14,694
say a BMW or a Ferrari...

1013
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:16,461
what happens to it?

1014
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:19,760
Tea

1015
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:26,607
I don't tell anyone this

1016
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:31,600
But I'll tell you

1017
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,846
These big cars...

1018
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,178
can't be sold openly

1019
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:40,679
Right

1020
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:43,215
So what we do is this...

1021
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:46,550
We dismantle them
and sell them

1022
01:04:47,116 --> 01:04:47,856
Boss

1023
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:49,659
Mohan, that's Boss

1024
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,196
Dismantle them?

1025
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:54,161
Yes

1026
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:56,394
At Sion village or Worli village

1027
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:59,606
There the car is taken apart

1028
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:01,806
So this is the...

1029
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:05,835
Tire

1030
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:08,911
Goes to Opera House

1031
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:15,344
What did you rip?

1032
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:16,556
Rexin

1033
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,588
Goes to Mahalakshmi

1034
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:23,824
The seat

1035
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:26,327
Goes to Mohammad Ali Road

1036
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,697
And the steering wheel
comes to me

1037
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:31,566
Right, the steering wheel

1038
01:05:32,628 --> 01:05:33,698
Now what's left?

1039
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:36,507
The body
- Right, the body

1040
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,508
The body can't be sold

1041
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,578
So we take it...

1042
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:45,283
and put it into a furnace

1043
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:51,691
It melts into a...

1044
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:54,417
ball

1045
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:57,855
Have one
- No, thank you

1046
01:05:58,387 --> 01:05:59,365
Mr. Tambe?

1047
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:11,405
What's that?

1048
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:14,809
S class

1049
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:17,275
Mercedes

1050
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:49,910
My man stands proud
and commanding

1051
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:52,909
Gave his word
and got me a Ferrari

1052
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,477
As the ghetto gapes
and stares

1053
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:58,425
I lap it all up, put on airs

1054
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:00,355
Let me go now

1055
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,361
Don't flirt and tease

1056
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:06,390
Let go of me

1057
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,870
Release me please

1058
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,670
My man stands proud
and commanding

1059
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:16,603
Gave his word
and got me a Ferrari

1060
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,005
As the ghetto gapes
and stares

1061
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:21,838
I lap it all up, put on airs

1062
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:23,806
Let me go now

1063
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:26,851
Don't flirt and tease

1064
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,050
Let go of me

1065
01:07:30,913 --> 01:07:33,519
Release me please

1066
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,751
All around they encircle
and .adore me

1067
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:03,755
Slip away now
you won't get a whiff of me

1068
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:06,858
Hundreds like you
dangle in queue

1069
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:09,723
Why should I la y
my gaze on you

1070
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,627
All around they encircle
and .adore me

1071
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:15,736
Slip away now
you won't get a whiff of me

1072
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,633
You're too naive for
Iove and Desire

1073
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:21,637
Too soft and sweet,
all smoke and no fire

1074
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:24,065
Your performance won't
lure me to you, sir

1075
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:26,910
Take your routine
elsewhere, to another

1076
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:28,742
Let me go now

1077
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:31,780
Don't flirt and tease

1078
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:34,854
Let go of me

1079
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:39,017
Release me please

1080
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:53,836
I Swish like fish,
my cheeks like pear/

1081
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:57,010
Hips lush with youth,
I twist and twirl

1082
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:59,913
Why chase ms,
you Te not my kind

1083
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:02,904
Paws off and
watch your behind

1084
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:05,681
I Swish like fish,
my cheeks like pearl

1085
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:08,912
Hips lush with youth,
I twist and twirl

1086
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:11,820
Meet me later,
I have to rush, dear

1087
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:14,755
It's for my man
I dolled up and came here

1088
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:17,160
He slid this ornament into me

1089
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:20,059
A mirror, quick,
to see the glow he 'll see...

1090
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,931
Let me go to him

1091
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:25,402
Let me go please

1092
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:27,866
Have to go now

1093
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:31,007
Need to go now

1094
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:33,013
Let me go now

1095
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:36,080
Don't flirt and tease

1096
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:38,446
Let go of me

1097
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:42,787
Release me please

1098
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:45,855
I'm going now

1099
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:50,460
Let me go now

1100
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:54,892
Let me go to her

1101
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:58,997
Alright Rusy,
here's Rs. 150,000

1102
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:02,500
Before the Press gets here,
take the car away

1103
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,200
Thank you

1104
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,118
Mohan

1105
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:25,252
How much does a
Ferrari cost?

1106
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:27,049
I'll tell you

1107
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:29,685
If you sell that hole
you call home...

1108
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:33,029
to three people,
over three years...

1109
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,826
you still won't get a Ferrari tire

1110
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,127
Don't fib

1111
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,638
It has just two seats

1112
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:43,098
No seats in the back

1113
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:45,643
A scooter also has two seats

1114
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:47,743
A Ferrari also has two seats

1115
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:52,150
How much extra can
two wheels cost?

1116
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,086
4... 5000?

1117
01:11:57,913 --> 01:12:00,120
Hello?

1118
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:02,055
Good morning, ma'am

1119
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:04,325
Yes ma'am. OK ma'am

1120
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:05,923
Have a good day

1121
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:07,860
What's the matter, Mohan?

1122
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:11,138
That was Mrs. Tendulkar.
Boss is coming back

1123
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:12,966
I'm off to my village

1124
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:13,628
Wait

1125
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:15,609
Tell the cops
I committed suicide

1126
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:18,870
And my body is in
Shamshu's furnace

1127
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:20,104
Wait, calm down

1128
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:22,772
We have some time.
I have a plan. C'mon

1129
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:24,143
Leave me out of it

1130
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:26,753
Boss is back tomorrow night,
don't worry

1131
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:27,951
Come with me

1132
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,351
Mohan

1133
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:33,992
Police

1134
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:35,320
Run

1135
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:36,753
Run!

1136
01:12:36,952 --> 01:12:37,930
C'mon, hurry

1137
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:39,821
Mohan, wait for me.
My helmet

1138
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:43,031
Put it on. Use your head

1139
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:03,055
Mohan

1140
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:09,362
Mohan, I can hear
the sound of the Ferrari

1141
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:11,092
You're going mad. Run

1142
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:33,910
Rustom Behram Deboo,
Transport Office

1143
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,852
Sir, why's the police
here today?

1144
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,183
The Ganesh festival
and Sachin's century...

1145
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,088
That's when the police
works overtime

1146
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:42,957
Just a precaution
- OK

1147
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:44,862
Not starting?

1148
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,693
It'll start, sir

1149
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:48,357
Listen, try this

1150
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,202
Run it down the slope
in neutral

1151
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:52,763
Then slip it into 2nd gear.
It'll start

1152
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:53,765
OK...

1153
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,034
Get on the slope

1154
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:56,743
In neutral?
- Yes

1155
01:13:56,899 --> 01:13:59,106
Keep it in neutral.
Now put it into 2nd gear

1156
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:00,405
There, it started

1157
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:08,321
Rustom, hold on

1158
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:10,115
Help me with this

1159
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:11,985
Got to nab this red car

1160
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,388
Yes sir...

1161
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:33,304
Hello?

1162
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:36,909
Rusy, where are you?
It's morning

1163
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:38,216
Where were you?

1164
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:42,145
Papa, something terrible
has happened

1165
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:45,052
What... You had an accident?

1166
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:49,762
Papa, I stole Sachin's Ferrari

1167
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:54,827
You crazy?
I was fooling with you

1168
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:56,294
Where's the car?

1169
01:14:57,793 --> 01:15:01,036
The car's being towed away

1170
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:04,309
Now do as I say.
Come straight home

1171
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:05,308
Wear your helmet

1172
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:07,846
Hide your face from the cops

1173
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:09,737
Something really terrible
happened, Papa

1174
01:15:09,738 --> 01:15:11,046
What now?

1175
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:15,148
Papa, I left Rs.150,000
in the car

1176
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:20,120
Kayo can't go to Lord's, Papa

1177
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:24,091
Kayo... Lord's...

1178
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:46,213
Pawar, prepare that report.
I'm leaving

1179
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:47,215
C'mon Jadhav

1180
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:49,154
Jadhav, slow down

1181
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:53,058
Stop, I said

1182
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:58,559
Inspector Mhatre,
what have you brought in?

1183
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:01,601
It's called a car.
Has four wheels...

1184
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:03,929
Sir, this is no car.
It's a celestial chariot

1185
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:05,730
The chariot of my God

1186
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:08,272
It's Sachin Tendulkar's Ferrari

1187
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:10,507
But your God parked
in a No Parking zone

1188
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:13,510
Will my God come
to get his car, sir?

1189
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:15,613
Whether it's your God
or his driver...

1190
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:18,115
don't release the car
without taking the fine

1191
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,146
Don't worry, sir.
I'll watch over this car

1192
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:25,113
0 Lord, thank you

1193
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,196
There's the Ferrari

1194
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,940
Looking good, Pakya

1195
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:45,912
But the Ferrari can't be seen

1196
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:48,546
Where is the Ferrari?

1197
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:50,683
Look for it

1198
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:53,948
Go to the next one

1199
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:55,680
It's covered with flowers

1200
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:57,551
Is it a Ferrari
or a humble taxi?

1201
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:01,591
Pakya, your dad's fooled you

1202
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:05,329
His dad fooled him

1203
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:06,722
How many done, Babbu didi?

1204
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:08,959
180 couples done, 20 to go

1205
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:10,135
20...

1206
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:11,601
You. Come here

1207
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,103
Married?
- Yes sir

1208
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:14,332
What was the hurry?

1209
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:15,934
Never mind

1210
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:17,871
Get your wife
and get re-married

1211
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:19,273
But sir...
- If she objects...

1212
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:21,773
tell her you're
renewing your vows

1213
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:24,010
She'll be thrilled.
Run, now

1214
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:25,776
That makes 181 couples

1215
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:26,952
Give me a minute

1216
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,011
What's this?
- What's what?

1217
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:31,320
What's this, Babbu didi?

1218
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:33,793
Who told you to use
so many flowers?

1219
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:35,587
Who does that to a Ferrari?

1220
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:38,288
It's a wedding car -
it must have flowers

1221
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,257
You're Mr. Mandke's
son, no less

1222
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:42,691
If there were fewer flowers,
people would gossip

1223
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:43,962
They'd call us stingy

1224
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:45,366
They're gossiping now

1225
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:47,604
Saying it's not a Ferrari
under the flowers...

1226
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:48,969
it's an ordinary taxi

1227
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:50,709
People will say anything

1228
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:53,142
You know the truth.
You know it's a Ferrari

1229
01:17:53,602 --> 01:17:56,981
Walk the path of truth, son.
It's useful in the long run

1230
01:17:57,105 --> 01:17:58,641
You wronged me, Babbu didi

1231
01:17:58,674 --> 01:17:59,345
C'mon now...

1232
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,882
You committed a fraud

1233
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:04,256
Our deal is off

1234
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:05,851
No compromise

1235
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:08,289
At my wedding tomorrow,
I want the Ferrari

1236
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:09,888
Without flowers on it

1237
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:14,196
Go on, now

1238
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,692
Told you to get an abortion

1239
01:18:16,892 --> 01:18:18,337
Look at what you produced

1240
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:19,865
What kind of talk is that?

1241
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:21,639
Mom...

1242
01:18:22,064 --> 01:18:24,271
What sort of guy did you marry?

1243
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,867
If you had asked me,
I would've rejected him

1244
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:28,074
Be quiet

1245
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:32,974
You all go ahead

1246
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:33,745
Pakya...

1247
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:36,683
Don't say anything

1248
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:37,845
Leave, I said

1249
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:38,881
Going

1250
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:41,961
Babbu didi, please handle this

1251
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:49,130
The Press will not see
the Ferrari

1252
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:50,795
That's final

1253
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:54,068
That's my order

1254
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:58,036
Then the Press will not see...

1255
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:02,177
me wearing a number

1256
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:03,805
That's my wish

1257
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:07,408
You can't afford a wish,
you pipsqueak

1258
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,013
Dad, no...

1259
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:12,315
Don't mess with me, boy

1260
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:19,763
Sir, couple no. 182

1261
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:24,302
I'll see you at home

1262
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:29,367
What happened?

1263
01:19:29,898 --> 01:19:31,104
Scram

1264
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,311
I've always told you...

1265
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:36,005
to stay away from cricket

1266
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:38,375
It's made you into a thief now

1267
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:41,049
The Great Gangster
of the Deboo family...

1268
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:42,918
Rustom Behram Deboo

1269
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:44,852
Papa, I have to
send Kayo to Lord's

1270
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,917
Why are you so dense?

1271
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:51,196
During recession in the
white man's land...

1272
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:53,096
camps like this are invented

1273
01:19:53,221 --> 01:19:56,259
They look for gullible fools
like you, who fall for it

1274
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:58,335
You want to go to prison?

1275
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:02,207
In prison, hold a slate,
get your mug shots taken

1276
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,102
Make your family famous

1277
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:07,175
Cricket ruins you, I tell you

1278
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:12,813
There're many dirty games
behind this sport

1279
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:14,109
Answer this...

1280
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,482
Who knows cricket best,
you or me?

1281
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:18,456
Papa, I know...
- No, tell me...

1282
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,926
who knows cricket best,
you or me?

1283
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:23,193
Papa, I know some cricket too

1284
01:20:23,518 --> 01:20:24,929
I played well once

1285
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:26,292
But you didn't let me play

1286
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:28,024
Well, thank me for it

1287
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:30,234
I saved you

1288
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:31,904
Protected you

1289
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:33,836
Papa, don't protect Kayo

1290
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:36,005
Let him live his life

1291
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:38,067
He's a gifted cricketer

1292
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,538
He'll make you proud one day

1293
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:42,371
That pint-sized rookie
a cricketer?

1294
01:20:42,804 --> 01:20:45,944
He knocks a ball in a sock
in the living room

1295
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:48,052
That won't make him
a cricketer

1296
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:49,814
Papa, you haven't
seen his game

1297
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:51,322
He's captain of his team

1298
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:55,427
In India, millions of kids
play cricket

1299
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:58,224
From the city center,
if you hurl a pebble...

1300
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:01,334
it'll land on a captain's head

1301
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:03,094
Rusy

1302
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:04,861
Remember this...

1303
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:08,266
In a cricket team,
there are only eleven players

1304
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:11,408
What of those who don't
make it to the team?

1305
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:13,071
I'll tell you

1306
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:15,905
They sit on a sofa,
stare at the

1307
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:18,484
use a remote control,
and tuck into peanuts

1308
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:23,418
You may as well put a
Kayo-sized sofa next to mine

1309
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:27,193
Why are you destroying his life?

1310
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:29,158
I'm not destroying his life

1311
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:30,395
I'm helping him make it

1312
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:33,589
You think he'll ever make it
to the top eleven?

1313
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:38,597
No Papa

1314
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:42,336
He's way ahead of the top eleven

1315
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:45,306
No one is even close to him

1316
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:48,072
Not even you

1317
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,447
Know who you're talking to?

1318
01:21:52,474 --> 01:21:54,351
You're talking to
Behram Ardeshir Deboo

1319
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:57,184
You know who you're talking to?

1320
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:13,071
Papa, you were the bestest?

1321
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:15,068
Bowl as many balls as you want

1322
01:22:15,964 --> 01:22:16,635
Just...

1323
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:19,942
try and get him out

1324
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:29,451
Kayo

1325
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:32,084
Papa

1326
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:34,257
Want to play a match?

1327
01:22:34,516 --> 01:22:35,324
A match?

1328
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:36,992
Now?

1329
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:39,123
With whom?

1330
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:50,371
Papa?

1331
01:26:14,636 --> 01:26:15,876
He's asleep?

1332
01:26:17,138 --> 01:26:18,344
Yes Papa

1333
01:26:26,214 --> 01:26:27,852
Today's the selection?

1334
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:31,125
Yes Papa

1335
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:34,857
You take Kayo for it

1336
01:26:38,459 --> 01:26:40,564
I'll get the money

1337
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:52,877
Where will you get
the money from?

1338
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:55,552
An old friend

1339
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,157
He owes me one

1340
01:27:02,183 --> 01:27:04,561
I'll call you when
I get the money

1341
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:12,469
You just get Kayo to the ground

1342
01:27:14,762 --> 01:27:16,264
You're looking good

1343
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:41,428
Rusy
- Yes Papa?

1344
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:44,929
Give Kayo this tip

1345
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:46,498
Yes?

1346
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:48,567
When...

1347
01:27:49,964 --> 01:27:51,966
a bowler bowls...

1348
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:57,843
Go on, Papa.
When a bowler bowls...

1349
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:00,583
No, let him play
the way he does

1350
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:04,389
He'll knock them off their feet

1351
01:28:31,339 --> 01:28:32,875
Everyone ready?
- Yes sir

1352
01:28:33,408 --> 01:28:35,649
Let's go.
Batsman to my right

1353
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:37,480
Bowlers to my left

1354
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:05,041
I want to meet
Dilip Dharmadhikari

1355
01:29:06,507 --> 01:29:07,611
Well?

1356
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:11,650
From my club, at least
one boy should go to Lord's

1357
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:13,784
You want your son to go?

1358
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:16,960
He really wants to go

1359
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:18,422
Do something

1360
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,987
You do something
about those TV rights

1361
01:29:20,988 --> 01:29:22,490
Consider it done

1362
01:29:22,724 --> 01:29:24,533
Then consider this done, too

1363
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:28,068
Gattu Godbole,
his name. RC Club

1364
01:29:28,596 --> 01:29:30,371
Gattu Godbole. OK

1365
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,480
Excuse me, sir.
Mr. Deboo's here to meet you

1366
01:29:34,902 --> 01:29:36,848
Who Deboo?
- Behram Deboo

1367
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:41,913
6th floor

1368
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:50,662
Deboo

1369
01:29:58,493 --> 01:30:00,473
After so many years

1370
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:03,031
Please sit down

1371
01:30:03,464 --> 01:30:05,842
You've put on some weight

1372
01:30:07,101 --> 01:30:08,842
What will you have?
Tea? Coffee?

1373
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:11,475
Beer?

1374
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:13,613
One coffee, please

1375
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:16,943
How many years
has it been, Deboo?

1376
01:30:16,944 --> 01:30:18,048
38 years

1377
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:21,791
How time flies

1378
01:30:24,652 --> 01:30:26,723
So, to what do I
owe this honor?

1379
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:31,028
38 years back...

1380
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:33,735
I had a friend

1381
01:30:35,863 --> 01:30:38,742
We did everything together...

1382
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:41,743
shared all secrets...

1383
01:30:42,069 --> 01:30:46,711
checked out pretty girls together

1384
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:53,392
We made thousands of runs
together in record partnerships

1385
01:30:53,714 --> 01:30:56,627
Those were the days

1386
01:31:00,588 --> 01:31:01,430
Dilip

1387
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:11,038
What you did to me...

1388
01:31:11,866 --> 01:31:14,968
After 38 years, you're here
to make me feel guilty?

1389
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:16,573
No
- Is that so?

1390
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:19,577
Not at all

1391
01:31:20,741 --> 01:31:22,618
That's not so

1392
01:31:23,044 --> 01:31:25,524
I'm ready to forget and forgive

1393
01:31:26,647 --> 01:31:29,423
If I do that...

1394
01:31:30,184 --> 01:31:31,985
then you're my only friend

1395
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:32,555
Yes

1396
01:31:32,787 --> 01:31:34,960
You are my friend, yes?
- Of course

1397
01:31:36,858 --> 01:31:37,836
Well?

1398
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:39,062
Dilip

1399
01:31:40,027 --> 01:31:41,597
I have a grandson

1400
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:45,911
Deboo, you're a grandfather?

1401
01:31:46,467 --> 01:31:48,003
I don't look old enough, I know

1402
01:31:49,904 --> 01:31:51,178
He's a cricketer

1403
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:53,085
Of course he is

1404
01:31:53,608 --> 01:31:58,819
You know that
cricket camp at Lord's?

1405
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:01,954
He wants to go for that

1406
01:32:04,785 --> 01:32:07,527
Well, you see, I must tell you...

1407
01:32:07,755 --> 01:32:09,666
the selection is based on merit

1408
01:32:09,891 --> 01:32:11,858
And in this position,
I can't favor anyone

1409
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:12,803
Hold it, Dilip

1410
01:32:12,994 --> 01:32:15,497
I'm not asking you
to do anything wrong

1411
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:16,565
I'm just clarifying

1412
01:32:17,131 --> 01:32:18,804
I understand your position

1413
01:32:18,933 --> 01:32:21,504
He's so good,
he will be selected

1414
01:32:22,103 --> 01:32:26,984
The problem is the Rs. 150,000
to be paid after that

1415
01:32:28,109 --> 01:32:30,953
It's 150,000 yes

1416
01:32:31,245 --> 01:32:33,816
So I thought of some options

1417
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:37,720
Can you ask the Board...

1418
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:41,931
for a grant or scholarship?

1419
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:44,032
No, it will not work out

1420
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:47,706
If we do it for one,
we'll have to do it for others

1421
01:32:47,828 --> 01:32:49,569
And if the Press gets wind of it...

1422
01:32:49,697 --> 01:32:50,573
I know

1423
01:32:50,765 --> 01:32:53,507
In this position, actually,
my hands are tied

1424
01:32:53,834 --> 01:32:55,142
I understand

1425
01:32:55,803 --> 01:32:56,873
What now...

1426
01:33:00,942 --> 01:33:04,253
There's another option

1427
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:10,120
As my friend...

1428
01:33:12,286 --> 01:33:15,597
can't you loan me Rs. 150,0007

1429
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:24,905
Yeah?

1430
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:27,210
One moment

1431
01:33:31,806 --> 01:33:32,910
I'll just be back

1432
01:33:54,195 --> 01:33:55,674
Kayoze - Net no. 2

1433
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:09,213
Every gaze is fixed on you

1434
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:14,020
Each heart harbors new hope

1435
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:22,130
The crowds support you

1436
01:34:22,757 --> 01:34:24,202
The crowds support you

1437
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:26,026
So do what champions do

1438
01:34:26,027 --> 01:34:30,806
With a mighty bat,
make a hefty score

1439
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:33,842
More...

1440
01:34:34,201 --> 01:34:35,236
He hits

1441
01:34:35,736 --> 01:34:36,771
Up and a way

1442
01:34:37,304 --> 01:34:38,977
In the air

1443
01:34:39,073 --> 01:34:40,677
A big hit

1444
01:34:55,156 --> 01:34:56,134
Thank you

1445
01:35:00,294 --> 01:35:01,932
Sir, he won't be back

1446
01:35:02,663 --> 01:35:03,300
Why?

1447
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:05,039
I speak from experience

1448
01:35:10,871 --> 01:35:11,747
Sir

1449
01:35:13,374 --> 01:35:15,115
I'm a big fan

1450
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:17,412
You took eight wickets...

1451
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:19,858
on the dead pitch
of the Matunga Club

1452
01:35:21,015 --> 01:35:22,016
I still remember that clearly

1453
01:35:23,084 --> 01:35:28,124
Sir, an autograph please

1454
01:35:36,097 --> 01:35:38,008
Hello Papa? Any luck?

1455
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:43,012
It'll work out, don't worry

1456
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:46,878
How's our boy playing?

1457
01:35:49,944 --> 01:35:51,855
He's knocking them
off their feet

1458
01:35:53,447 --> 01:35:55,984
Papa, you went to meet
Dilip Dharmadhikari?

1459
01:35:58,686 --> 01:35:59,960
It didn't work out, did it, Papa?

1460
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:04,236
It's ok Papa, we'll find a way

1461
01:36:05,192 --> 01:36:07,365
It'll work out, Papa.
Don't worry

1462
01:36:07,828 --> 01:36:09,933
Later... I'll call you later

1463
01:36:14,835 --> 01:36:16,337
Well played, Kayo

1464
01:36:18,339 --> 01:36:19,818
Nice

1465
01:36:20,241 --> 01:36:22,915
Sir, I have to leave
on some urgent work

1466
01:36:23,144 --> 01:36:25,181
Would you please
drop Kayo home?

1467
01:36:25,446 --> 01:36:26,754
Sure, no problem

1468
01:36:28,482 --> 01:36:30,086
Shot

1469
01:36:32,853 --> 01:36:34,025
Don't worry, I'll drop him

1470
01:36:35,422 --> 01:36:37,766
Get away from the car

1471
01:36:38,092 --> 01:36:39,503
Don't touch the car

1472
01:36:39,994 --> 01:36:41,473
Don't touch the hood

1473
01:36:41,896 --> 01:36:43,466
Everyone move back

1474
01:36:46,333 --> 01:36:48,279
Stop taking pictures

1475
01:36:52,506 --> 01:36:53,507
Who are you?

1476
01:36:53,908 --> 01:36:55,478
Rustom Behram Deboo,
Transport Office

1477
01:36:56,076 --> 01:36:58,283
So help me out here.
Move everyone away

1478
01:36:58,779 --> 01:37:00,190
Sir, I have an idea

1479
01:37:00,447 --> 01:37:01,391
There's Sachin

1480
01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:02,418
Where?

1481
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:03,325
There

1482
01:37:06,053 --> 01:37:07,532
Sir, where are you off to?

1483
01:37:07,988 --> 01:37:08,898
To Sachin...

1484
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:10,024
Sir, that was just to distract them

1485
01:37:10,191 --> 01:37:12,068
Before they're back,
put barricades here

1486
01:37:12,226 --> 01:37:15,036
I'll be back in ten minutes.
I have another idea

1487
01:37:15,296 --> 01:37:16,331
Thank you

1488
01:37:21,268 --> 01:37:22,406
Sir

1489
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:24,381
Excuse me, sir

1490
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:26,985
Sir, your scooter key

1491
01:37:27,208 --> 01:37:29,017
Thank you
- Mention not

1492
01:37:30,911 --> 01:37:33,414
Good news, old chap

1493
01:37:33,981 --> 01:37:36,018
No Ferrari has come
here for gas

1494
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,151
In Mumbai, there are only
five gas stations...

1495
01:37:38,152 --> 01:37:39,426
that stock gas for the Ferrari

1496
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:41,333
We've checked all five

1497
01:37:41,789 --> 01:37:42,859
This means...

1498
01:37:43,090 --> 01:37:47,004
the thief has gas for only 50 km

1499
01:37:47,294 --> 01:37:49,831
But 50 km in which direction?

1500
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:52,374
The car may have gone
50 km this way...

1501
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:55,244
while we go 50 km that way

1502
01:37:55,536 --> 01:37:57,573
That makes 100 km

1503
01:37:58,038 --> 01:38:01,076
Your brain measures
1 centimeter

1504
01:38:01,809 --> 01:38:03,447
Don't put a 100 km load on it

1505
01:38:03,577 --> 01:38:05,557
C'mon, start your Ferrari

1506
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:08,392
My brain's not working

1507
01:38:08,449 --> 01:38:09,450
Give me the helmet

1508
01:38:10,284 --> 01:38:13,527
That scooter key looked like
the Ferrari key to me

1509
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:15,559
Don't remind me of the key.
C'mon, hurry

1510
01:38:16,557 --> 01:38:18,400
And how much for this?

1511
01:38:18,492 --> 01:38:21,336
5000... 3000... 2000...

1512
01:38:21,528 --> 01:38:23,599
1500... 1500... 1500...

1513
01:38:24,031 --> 01:38:24,839
Rs. 1500...

1514
01:38:25,032 --> 01:38:27,012
What model, what size?

1515
01:38:27,301 --> 01:38:28,336
Tell me, Your Royal Highness?

1516
01:38:28,869 --> 01:38:31,349
Size... It's big

1517
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:33,176
Is it a truck?

1518
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:35,411
You need a large banner

1519
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:37,514
Sorry

1520
01:38:38,846 --> 01:38:39,984
Excuse me

1521
01:38:40,447 --> 01:38:42,222
Sir

1522
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:43,391
A banner

1523
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:44,284
Banner?

1524
01:38:44,285 --> 01:38:45,286
Why a banner?

1525
01:39:10,344 --> 01:39:12,950
Lower it carefully

1526
01:39:13,314 --> 01:39:15,225
That's great

1527
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:19,659
No one will touch it now

1528
01:39:38,605 --> 01:39:40,050
Clear off now

1529
01:39:40,607 --> 01:39:42,917
Sir, one moment

1530
01:39:44,278 --> 01:39:45,484
BCA?

1531
01:39:45,913 --> 01:39:47,290
Bombay Cricket Association?

1532
01:39:47,581 --> 01:39:49,618
Sir, I was once President

1533
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:50,519
Of BCA?

1534
01:39:50,684 --> 01:39:52,391
No... Our BCA is...

1535
01:39:52,553 --> 01:39:53,657
Borivli Cricket Association

1536
01:39:54,054 --> 01:39:56,034
A cricket club for our constables

1537
01:39:56,223 --> 01:39:59,227
Sir, I'm famous for my
quarter centuries

1538
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:03,005
Sir, you're here for
Sachin Tendulkar's car?

1539
01:40:07,267 --> 01:40:09,474
Who's the senior officer here?

1540
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:12,173
Who brought Sachin's car here?

1541
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,951
It wasn't me.
It was Inspector Mhatre

1542
01:40:14,975 --> 01:40:17,148
Get Inspector Mhatre

1543
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:18,711
Get Mhatre here

1544
01:40:18,712 --> 01:40:20,692
Sir, Inspector Mhatre
plays football

1545
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:23,017
He knows nothing of cricket

1546
01:40:23,183 --> 01:40:24,594
This is Sachin's car

1547
01:40:24,952 --> 01:40:26,124
He didn't know that

1548
01:40:26,253 --> 01:40:28,290
The car was in a
No Parking zone, so...

1549
01:40:28,555 --> 01:40:33,004
Yes, but how will I know if
the car's with cops or thieves?

1550
01:40:33,227 --> 01:40:34,331
It's like this, sir...

1551
01:40:34,495 --> 01:40:36,065
When we confiscate a car...

1552
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:37,468
we make a chalk circle there

1553
01:40:37,698 --> 01:40:41,236
In it we write the name of
the police station the car is at

1554
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:43,075
If you make a chalk mark...

1555
01:40:43,303 --> 01:40:45,442
and thousands walk over it...

1556
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:47,246
won't it get erased?

1557
01:40:48,008 --> 01:40:51,310
Yes... But sir,
we have to follow orders

1558
01:40:51,311 --> 01:40:52,722
Who's the senior officer here?

1559
01:40:54,014 --> 01:40:55,084
Who's your senior?

1560
01:40:55,215 --> 01:40:56,216
I'm the senior-most, sir

1561
01:40:56,316 --> 01:40:58,023
But don't scold me sir, please

1562
01:40:58,218 --> 01:40:59,094
Did I scold you?

1563
01:40:59,486 --> 01:41:00,294
Did I get angry?

1564
01:41:00,587 --> 01:41:02,191
Did I raise my voice?
- No

1565
01:41:02,256 --> 01:41:03,701
Who dares to say
I scolded you?

1566
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:05,992
I want to meet
your senior officer

1567
01:41:05,993 --> 01:41:07,995
Sir, take the car

1568
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:11,073
Yes, take the car

1569
01:41:11,298 --> 01:41:13,073
I'll handle Inspector Mhatre

1570
01:41:13,267 --> 01:41:14,371
No fine, nothing

1571
01:41:14,501 --> 01:41:16,310
You must take the fine
- No sir

1572
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:17,642
Sachin will scold me

1573
01:41:18,105 --> 01:41:20,051
Please sir,
I don't want anything

1574
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:20,650
OK

1575
01:41:21,275 --> 01:41:23,414
But how do I take the car...

1576
01:41:23,544 --> 01:41:25,387
Sir, I'll get you a tow truck

1577
01:41:25,579 --> 01:41:27,581
It'll drop you where you want

1578
01:41:27,781 --> 01:41:30,227
Free of charge
- Totally free

1579
01:41:31,085 --> 01:41:32,792
Gautiya... Ashok...

1580
01:41:36,056 --> 01:41:36,534
Hello?

1581
01:41:36,623 --> 01:41:38,227
Hello Papa, this is Kayo

1582
01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:39,297
Yes son?

1583
01:41:39,493 --> 01:41:40,801
Papa, I got selected

1584
01:41:41,395 --> 01:41:42,669
I'm so proud of you, son

1585
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:45,235
Kayo, listen - I got the money

1586
01:41:45,466 --> 01:41:46,342
Got the money?

1587
01:41:47,267 --> 01:41:47,608
Sir

1588
01:41:48,168 --> 01:41:48,771
One moment, sir

1589
01:41:49,136 --> 01:41:50,274
Papa, hold on

1590
01:41:51,071 --> 01:41:52,744
Sir, it's Papa.
He got the money

1591
01:41:53,674 --> 01:41:54,709
Rusy, congratulations

1592
01:41:55,175 --> 01:41:56,813
Today, both father and son
are victorious

1593
01:41:57,578 --> 01:41:58,318
Thank you, sir

1594
01:41:58,712 --> 01:41:59,486
Kayo sounds...

1595
01:42:00,047 --> 01:42:02,425
He's jumping with joy

1596
01:42:04,284 --> 01:42:07,128
Sir, I'll see you tomorrow
morning then

1597
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:08,493
OK. Here, talk to him

1598
01:42:10,691 --> 01:42:12,432
Kayo listen
- Yes Papa?

1599
01:42:12,593 --> 01:42:14,300
I'll call you later

1600
01:42:14,595 --> 01:42:17,735
I'll call you.
I love you. Bye

1601
01:42:18,599 --> 01:42:20,545
Gautiya, let's go
- Gautiya, drive safe

1602
01:42:20,667 --> 01:42:22,271
Thank you, sir

1603
01:43:03,810 --> 01:43:06,120
What's wrong with Pakya?

1604
01:43:10,450 --> 01:43:13,192
Dad's here.
Give me the number plate

1605
01:43:18,358 --> 01:43:20,235
Whoever wants to take
a picture, take it now

1606
01:43:20,527 --> 01:43:24,236
Tomorrow's newspaper
should print this headline...

1607
01:43:24,431 --> 01:43:27,605
Politician's son commits suicide'

1608
01:43:28,168 --> 01:43:30,546
Pakya, what are you doing?

1609
01:43:30,704 --> 01:43:31,704
Get down

1610
01:43:31,705 --> 01:43:33,446
Yes, come down

1611
01:43:35,242 --> 01:43:37,153
At the wedding today,
I want the Ferrari

1612
01:43:37,544 --> 01:43:39,421
If the Ferrari is there...

1613
01:43:39,713 --> 01:43:41,215
I'll be there

1614
01:43:41,515 --> 01:43:43,188
If not, I'll go up there...

1615
01:43:43,317 --> 01:43:45,524
your vote bank
will go down there

1616
01:43:45,752 --> 01:43:47,390
Why are you doing this?

1617
01:43:47,688 --> 01:43:49,497
Get down. Come home

1618
01:43:49,623 --> 01:43:51,159
Mom, stop talking

1619
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:53,262
You're talking too much

1620
01:43:53,393 --> 01:43:56,772
The People's Representative
is not talking at all

1621
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:58,232
Lokre

1622
01:43:58,565 --> 01:44:00,772
Speak, o Savior of the Masses

1623
01:44:01,335 --> 01:44:03,337
You're so brave, aren't you?

1624
01:44:03,503 --> 01:44:05,540
OK, go ahead and jump

1625
01:44:05,739 --> 01:44:08,345
Jump or I'll shoot you, Pakya

1626
01:44:08,609 --> 01:44:09,883
Dad's going to shoot me, man

1627
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:11,412
Don't be afraid, Pakya

1628
01:44:11,712 --> 01:44:13,248
1...

1629
01:44:13,914 --> 01:44:14,858
2...

1630
01:44:14,881 --> 01:44:16,690
Don't move, Pakya.
He won't shoot

1631
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:18,293
3...

1632
01:44:22,589 --> 01:44:24,432
Melodramatic clown

1633
01:44:25,425 --> 01:44:27,564
Holding his father to ransom

1634
01:44:27,861 --> 01:44:29,602
What does he think he's doing?

1635
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:31,307
Just get him the Ferrari

1636
01:44:31,531 --> 01:44:32,601
You think it's candy?

1637
01:44:33,233 --> 01:44:34,735
My dad wants to be famous

1638
01:44:35,736 --> 01:44:36,908
Now watch

1639
01:44:38,238 --> 01:44:40,878
In front of the Press,
I'll arrive in a Ferrari

1640
01:44:42,509 --> 01:44:43,579
Kayo

1641
01:44:44,344 --> 01:44:45,322
Papa

1642
01:44:45,379 --> 01:44:46,323
Hi son

1643
01:44:46,446 --> 01:44:47,925
See this - the money

1644
01:44:48,248 --> 01:44:48,692
The money?

1645
01:44:48,815 --> 01:44:50,351
I'm going to Lord's?
- Yes

1646
01:44:50,517 --> 01:44:51,962
My Papa's the bestest

1647
01:45:11,338 --> 01:45:14,478
I feel one boy from every club
should go to Lord's

1648
01:45:14,841 --> 01:45:17,447
It keeps everyone motivated

1649
01:45:18,378 --> 01:45:20,984
Ajay, has any club been left out?

1650
01:45:23,617 --> 01:45:26,325
Yes sir. JD club,
MBM club, RC club...

1651
01:45:26,486 --> 01:45:28,898
RC Club... I believe
it's a very good club

1652
01:45:30,290 --> 01:45:31,735
We should have a boy from there

1653
01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:32,868
Who's the President?

1654
01:45:32,959 --> 01:45:33,994
Mr. Godbole

1655
01:45:34,361 --> 01:45:34,896
Godbole...

1656
01:45:35,462 --> 01:45:36,668
Call up Godbole

1657
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:38,810
Ask him to recommend a player

1658
01:45:38,965 --> 01:45:40,035
Sir

1659
01:45:40,967 --> 01:45:43,573
Sir, on the board is a shortlist
of our 16 best players

1660
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:45,672
Yes, but some of these
will back out

1661
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:47,851
That first name, for instance

1662
01:45:48,041 --> 01:45:50,021
Unfortunately, he doesn't
have the money

1663
01:45:50,410 --> 01:45:51,787
No sir, he has no such problem

1664
01:45:51,878 --> 01:45:53,858
His grandfather came to me...

1665
01:45:53,947 --> 01:45:55,324
for a fee waiver

1666
01:45:55,515 --> 01:45:56,994
He's automatically out

1667
01:45:57,484 --> 01:45:58,053
Teja

1668
01:46:02,622 --> 01:46:03,464
Hello?

1669
01:46:03,824 --> 01:46:04,666
It's Vilayat

1670
01:46:04,858 --> 01:46:05,734
Yes sir?

1671
01:46:05,892 --> 01:46:07,929
Rusy, you've got the money?

1672
01:46:08,662 --> 01:46:09,333
Yes sir

1673
01:46:09,529 --> 01:46:10,769
I've got the money.
I told you

1674
01:46:10,864 --> 01:46:12,298
But he's saying you
don't have the money

1675
01:46:12,299 --> 01:46:13,835
Wants to cancel
Kayo's selection

1676
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,002
Who, sir?
Who's saying this?

1677
01:46:16,536 --> 01:46:17,412
Dharmadhikari

1678
01:46:17,938 --> 01:46:20,441
I see now. it's a
misunderstanding

1679
01:46:20,674 --> 01:46:21,584
I have the money, sir

1680
01:46:22,342 --> 01:46:23,343
Can you...

1681
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:24,454
come to the club now?

1682
01:46:24,878 --> 01:46:26,619
Right away. It's important

1683
01:46:27,013 --> 01:46:29,493
Sir, I'll see you there then

1684
01:46:29,649 --> 01:46:31,060
Bring the money
- OK

1685
01:46:38,492 --> 01:46:39,402
Rusy

1686
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:42,372
Now turn around

1687
01:46:42,763 --> 01:46:43,867
Go on

1688
01:46:47,401 --> 01:46:48,675
Hurry up

1689
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:57,048
Wait here till I get back, ok?

1690
01:46:57,644 --> 01:46:59,021
All the boys been signed up?

1691
01:46:59,413 --> 01:47:00,721
Let's fly to London

1692
01:47:00,947 --> 01:47:03,018
And wish you all a great,
happy new year

1693
01:47:03,383 --> 01:47:04,987
Happy new year, sir

1694
01:47:05,385 --> 01:47:06,921
Good evening. Gentlemen,
sorry to come in like this

1695
01:47:07,053 --> 01:47:08,896
This is my son, Kayoze Deboo.
Actually, Vilayat...

1696
01:47:09,389 --> 01:47:09,799
Hello sir

1697
01:47:09,923 --> 01:47:12,391
Vilayat called me.
I'm here to tell you that...

1698
01:47:12,392 --> 01:47:13,859
I have Rs. 150,000
- One moment

1699
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:14,861
What's this?

1700
01:47:15,462 --> 01:47:16,600
How did you get in?

1701
01:47:17,697 --> 01:47:19,040
The selection is over

1702
01:47:19,366 --> 01:47:21,642
I don't even know
if this boy plays well

1703
01:47:21,768 --> 01:47:23,748
He's better than you ever were

1704
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:27,077
Bowl to him once

1705
01:47:27,641 --> 01:47:28,813
He'll smash you

1706
01:47:29,609 --> 01:47:31,384
Deboo. You're back?

1707
01:47:32,145 --> 01:47:33,055
Tell everyone here...

1708
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:36,420
Didn't you say you
don't have the money?

1709
01:47:37,918 --> 01:47:39,397
Rusy
- Yes Papa?

1710
01:47:39,619 --> 01:47:41,690
Give me the car key,
I'll get the money

1711
01:47:41,955 --> 01:47:43,025
Papa, I have the money

1712
01:47:43,056 --> 01:47:45,058
Car key, Rusy,
don't argue

1713
01:47:45,158 --> 01:47:47,502
Papa, the money...
- The key, Rusy

1714
01:47:47,561 --> 01:47:49,006
I've brought the money

1715
01:47:55,769 --> 01:47:56,873
You also brought money?

1716
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:58,677
Yes
- Amazing

1717
01:47:59,105 --> 01:48:00,083
Here, Dilip

1718
01:48:03,109 --> 01:48:04,611
Tell me if you want more

1719
01:48:05,111 --> 01:48:07,113
I have another 150,000 rupees

1720
01:48:07,447 --> 01:48:09,893
Take next year's fee,
if you want

1721
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:11,552
Did you count it?
- Yes. It's 150,000

1722
01:48:11,718 --> 01:48:13,095
All good?
- Yes

1723
01:48:14,020 --> 01:48:14,862
Well?

1724
01:48:16,022 --> 01:48:18,696
My decision is final

1725
01:48:18,925 --> 01:48:20,700
The selection is over

1726
01:48:21,928 --> 01:48:23,930
You son-of-a...
- Wait Papa...

1727
01:48:24,130 --> 01:48:25,871
Papa, one moment

1728
01:48:26,066 --> 01:48:27,204
Papa, please

1729
01:48:35,041 --> 01:48:38,750
For 38 years, Papa has
battled you in his dreams

1730
01:48:39,079 --> 01:48:40,149
He's hit you

1731
01:48:41,982 --> 01:48:45,156
But he never realized
he was hurting himself...

1732
01:48:46,152 --> 01:48:48,154
while you were untouched

1733
01:48:52,058 --> 01:48:54,504
But today if you play dirty...

1734
01:48:55,128 --> 01:48:57,665
I'll forget you were
once Papa's friend

1735
01:49:00,634 --> 01:49:02,807
You'll get clobbered,
Mr. Dharmadhikari

1736
01:49:03,603 --> 01:49:04,946
Seriously clobbered

1737
01:49:07,574 --> 01:49:09,019
Mr. Dharmadhikari

1738
01:49:09,809 --> 01:49:11,880
This boy was selected on merit

1739
01:49:12,913 --> 01:49:14,915
If he doesn't go to London...

1740
01:49:15,181 --> 01:49:18,060
all committee members will resign

1741
01:49:38,038 --> 01:49:39,176
You're going to London?

1742
01:49:39,639 --> 01:49:42,051
Take thermal underwear
so you don't freeze

1743
01:49:42,709 --> 01:49:44,552
Papa, can I go to the fountain?

1744
01:49:44,578 --> 01:49:45,283
Yes, go

1745
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:51,058
Quickly tell me...

1746
01:49:52,285 --> 01:49:54,196
Where did you get
the money from?

1747
01:49:55,088 --> 01:49:56,192
I took it out of the Ferrari

1748
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:57,625
The Ferrari?

1749
01:49:58,525 --> 01:50:00,971
I went to the police station,
covered the car, got in

1750
01:50:01,595 --> 01:50:03,097
I got in, but it was a
tense situation

1751
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:05,874
The cops started towing
the car to Sachin's house

1752
01:50:06,066 --> 01:50:07,204
With me inside

1753
01:50:07,634 --> 01:50:10,137
I managed to slip out
with the money

1754
01:50:11,805 --> 01:50:13,250
Where did you get
the money from?

1755
01:50:13,740 --> 01:50:16,152
Give me a moment
- You must tell me

1756
01:50:16,309 --> 01:50:17,309
Tell me, Papa

1757
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:20,814
Hold on. Give me a moment

1758
01:50:20,981 --> 01:50:22,654
Papa, tell me how
you got the money

1759
01:50:22,849 --> 01:50:25,830
I brought the car here

1760
01:50:25,986 --> 01:50:27,624
What car? The Ferrari?

1761
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:38,867
Papa, this is Sachin's car

1762
01:50:39,566 --> 01:50:40,704
What is it doing here?

1763
01:50:42,202 --> 01:50:44,273
Gautiya dumped the car
and scooted

1764
01:50:44,738 --> 01:50:46,615
Give me the key, Rusy

1765
01:50:47,207 --> 01:50:48,777
We need to leave fast

1766
01:50:48,942 --> 01:50:49,920
Let's disappear

1767
01:50:50,176 --> 01:50:51,246
Yes, little one

1768
01:50:51,811 --> 01:50:52,755
You see...

1769
01:50:52,946 --> 01:50:55,756
the car came to your papa
for official work

1770
01:50:55,949 --> 01:50:57,986
I told your papa to get
the car home...

1771
01:50:58,118 --> 01:50:58,994
but your papa refused

1772
01:50:59,085 --> 01:51:00,753
So I called up Sachin

1773
01:51:00,754 --> 01:51:04,600
Sachin said - Please take it,
take the car

1774
01:51:04,724 --> 01:51:06,761
I'll top off the tank
and send it to you

1775
01:51:06,926 --> 01:51:09,099
I said there's a young
Sachin in my home

1776
01:51:09,262 --> 01:51:10,798
1... 2... 3...

1777
01:51:10,830 --> 01:51:12,639
What do we see...

1778
01:51:13,133 --> 01:51:16,080
Let's go drive all night.
Right, Rusy?

1779
01:51:16,269 --> 01:51:17,213
Come, sit

1780
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:19,978
C'mon, enter your kingdom.
Very nice

1781
01:51:20,306 --> 01:51:22,912
Papa, we have to drop
the car off at Sachin's

1782
01:51:23,309 --> 01:51:27,018
Yes, I know.
We'll fly it there, you'll see

1783
01:51:27,347 --> 01:51:29,623
Hurry Rusy

1784
01:51:31,818 --> 01:51:32,694
Grandpa

1785
01:51:36,890 --> 01:51:37,834
Thank you

1786
01:51:48,168 --> 01:51:48,908
Grandpa

1787
01:51:49,335 --> 01:51:51,747
Does Sachin sit on this seat?

1788
01:51:52,105 --> 01:51:55,109
Since it's his car,
this is the seat he sits on

1789
01:51:55,375 --> 01:51:57,116
No seats behind, anyway

1790
01:51:59,112 --> 01:52:01,388
And this is the
steering wheel he holds?

1791
01:52:01,848 --> 01:52:05,318
When he drives, he has to
hold this steering wheel

1792
01:52:06,119 --> 01:52:08,656
You want to touch it?

1793
01:52:09,756 --> 01:52:11,201
Yes
- Go ahead

1794
01:52:11,891 --> 01:52:13,268
Such small fingers you have

1795
01:52:13,393 --> 01:52:15,771
1 2... and...

1796
01:52:53,433 --> 01:52:55,777
C'mon let's take a ride

1797
01:52:58,138 --> 01:53:00,414
Spin, roll or dip, you decide

1798
01:53:03,143 --> 01:53:05,384
It's a groovy trip all the way

1799
01:53:05,845 --> 01:53:07,347
In a oar that ain't a car...

1800
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:10,293
but a whirlwind that
whisks you away

1801
01:53:11,384 --> 01:53:12,454
Fa fa fa fa...

1802
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:13,819
Ra ra ra ri...

1803
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:16,096
Fa fa fa fa... Ferrari

1804
01:53:16,189 --> 01:53:17,361
Sa sa sa sa...

1805
01:53:17,423 --> 01:53:18,824
Wa wa wa wa...

1806
01:53:18,825 --> 01:53:21,465
The swashbuckling
Ride in the Ferrari

1807
01:53:36,009 --> 01:53:38,343
Life bursts out,
bright and glamorous

1808
01:53:38,344 --> 01:53:41,018
From drab and dull
to unique and marvelous

1809
01:53:41,047 --> 01:53:44,961
We zip ahead without
a cars in the world now

1810
01:53:45,885 --> 01:53:48,353
It's a taste of
new adventure and cheer

1811
01:53:48,354 --> 01:53:50,956
Why waste the chance
we were given here

1812
01:53:50,957 --> 01:53:54,461
Let's dart away on
winged paths now

1813
01:53:55,395 --> 01:53:58,342
The heart holds sway
it must have its way

1814
01:53:58,364 --> 01:54:00,844
It's a magical night today

1815
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:02,004
Fa fa fa fa...

1816
01:54:02,168 --> 01:54:03,238
Ra ra ra ri...

1817
01:54:03,403 --> 01:54:05,781
Fa fa fa fa... Ferrari

1818
01:54:05,872 --> 01:54:06,942
Sa sa sa sa...

1819
01:54:07,073 --> 01:54:08,211
Wa wa wa wa...

1820
01:54:08,408 --> 01:54:10,820
The swashbuckling
Ride in the Ferrari

1821
01:54:10,844 --> 01:54:13,290
It's a Ride in a Ferrari

1822
01:54:13,313 --> 01:54:16,419
A Ride in the Ferrari.. Yeah

1823
01:54:20,186 --> 01:54:22,530
Hello?
- Rusy, come home quick

1824
01:54:23,022 --> 01:54:24,000
What happened, Uncle Pesi?

1825
01:54:24,057 --> 01:54:26,901
There're some ruffians here.
They're asking for 'Rustom'

1826
01:54:27,227 --> 01:54:29,434
OK, I'm on my way

1827
01:54:30,797 --> 01:54:31,832
What happened, Papa?

1828
01:54:32,232 --> 01:54:33,074
Kayo, where's the money?

1829
01:54:33,266 --> 01:54:34,370
Here, in the bag

1830
01:54:43,476 --> 01:54:44,887
Pakya, the Ferrari

1831
01:54:49,048 --> 01:54:50,925
Kayo, stay inside

1832
01:54:53,419 --> 01:54:54,489
Rusy

1833
01:54:54,854 --> 01:54:56,299
Who are these people?

1834
01:54:56,856 --> 01:54:58,301
One moment

1835
01:54:58,424 --> 01:55:00,028
Who are these fellows?

1836
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:01,330
Let me talk to them

1837
01:55:02,462 --> 01:55:04,339
Pakya, what's the problem here?

1838
01:55:04,931 --> 01:55:07,537
Tell me, do you people
have no other names?

1839
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:11,906
I yelled 'Rustom' and
20 Rustoms came out

1840
01:55:12,572 --> 01:55:14,916
Then I asked them for the Ferrari

1841
01:55:15,041 --> 01:55:16,179
And they knew nothing of it

1842
01:55:16,409 --> 01:55:18,480
You didn't tell anyone
you have the Ferrari?

1843
01:55:18,845 --> 01:55:20,620
Pakya, what is the matter?

1844
01:55:21,447 --> 01:55:23,484
Please give me the Ferrari key

1845
01:55:24,050 --> 01:55:25,427
I can't. I have to return the car now

1846
01:55:25,485 --> 01:55:27,294
Look wise guy...
- Easy, Pakya

1847
01:55:27,353 --> 01:55:27,888
It's ok, man

1848
01:55:27,954 --> 01:55:29,194
I've cleared this with Babbu didi

1849
01:55:29,222 --> 01:55:30,394
You can check with her

1850
01:55:31,057 --> 01:55:32,058
Don't mess with me

1851
01:55:32,158 --> 01:55:33,125
Give me the Ferrari key

1852
01:55:33,126 --> 01:55:34,469
Pakya, that's not possible

1853
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:36,631
Pakya, I'm sorry,
that's not possible'

1854
01:55:37,864 --> 01:55:38,365
Smart-ass

1855
01:55:38,431 --> 01:55:39,375
Pakya

1856
01:55:41,601 --> 01:55:43,080
Why don't you speak to Babbu didi...

1857
01:55:43,136 --> 01:55:43,876
Papa

1858
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:46,405
Rusy, shall I call the cops?
- No, I'll take care of it

1859
01:55:46,406 --> 01:55:48,477
OK, enough of your antics

1860
01:55:48,908 --> 01:55:51,445
Let go of me.
Pakya, this is wrong

1861
01:55:53,012 --> 01:55:55,288
Pakya, you can't take this car

1862
01:55:55,515 --> 01:55:57,051
I'm taking it. Get lost

1863
01:55:57,183 --> 01:55:58,059
Papa

1864
01:55:59,485 --> 01:56:00,886
This is Sachin's car.
You can't take it

1865
01:56:00,887 --> 01:56:01,922
My papa got it from office

1866
01:56:02,155 --> 01:56:03,133
Get out

1867
01:56:03,156 --> 01:56:04,658
Hey mister, don't touch him

1868
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:06,938
You can't take it.
It came to my papa's office

1869
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:08,564
How can you take it?
It's my papa's...

1870
01:56:08,594 --> 01:56:11,973
Listen squirt, he stole it.
From Sachin

1871
01:56:12,398 --> 01:56:15,004
Hey Bandit King -
you didn't tell him?

1872
01:56:19,005 --> 01:56:21,281
Papa, you stole Sachin's car?

1873
01:56:22,275 --> 01:56:23,652
What the...

1874
01:56:24,077 --> 01:56:25,078
Kayo, I...

1875
01:56:26,145 --> 01:56:28,216
Where do you think
you're taking the car?

1876
01:56:29,916 --> 01:56:30,916
Stop, scoundrel

1877
01:56:30,917 --> 01:56:32,157
Kayo, wait here

1878
01:56:33,186 --> 01:56:34,096
Papa

1879
01:56:41,995 --> 01:56:43,065
Taxi

1880
01:57:04,450 --> 01:57:05,554
Mohan

1881
01:57:06,052 --> 01:57:07,588
It's almost midnight

1882
01:57:08,187 --> 01:57:10,292
Boss will be here soon

1883
01:57:11,591 --> 01:57:12,729
Tell me...

1884
01:57:14,093 --> 01:57:15,470
how much cash
do you have on you?

1885
01:57:16,095 --> 01:57:17,699
Look, a mobile temple

1886
01:57:18,164 --> 01:57:20,166
I have 500 bucks, Mohan

1887
01:57:20,333 --> 01:57:23,246
But it's still ten days
to my next salary

1888
01:57:23,503 --> 01:57:26,074
You'll get the next salary
only if you get the Ferrari

1889
01:57:26,472 --> 01:57:27,678
C'mon, offer it all to God

1890
01:57:28,074 --> 01:57:31,419
Only He can save us now.
C'mon, let's donate this

1891
01:57:32,111 --> 01:57:38,585
Peace and Wealth breeze in,
Suffering beats a retreat

1892
01:57:38,651 --> 01:57:39,356
The Ferrari

1893
01:57:39,419 --> 01:57:40,056
Ferrari

1894
01:57:41,487 --> 01:57:42,693
The Ferrari!

1895
01:57:43,022 --> 01:57:44,558
It's the Ferrari, yes

1896
01:57:44,590 --> 01:57:46,069
Mohan, this way

1897
01:57:46,092 --> 01:57:47,196
Hurry

1898
01:57:48,194 --> 01:57:49,434
Pakya

1899
01:57:50,196 --> 01:57:51,266
Get back inside

1900
01:57:56,035 --> 01:57:57,402
Found our Ferrari

1901
01:57:57,403 --> 01:57:58,677
Where?
- There, ahead

1902
01:57:58,771 --> 01:57:59,647
What happened?

1903
01:58:00,406 --> 01:58:01,350
I don't know

1904
01:58:01,574 --> 01:58:03,110
The Ferrari stopped

1905
01:58:04,010 --> 01:58:05,580
Maybe the carburetor is clogged

1906
01:58:05,611 --> 01:58:07,750
Go check it, quick

1907
01:58:08,114 --> 01:58:09,347
Open the hood

1908
01:58:09,348 --> 01:58:10,549
Which button do I press?

1909
01:58:10,550 --> 01:58:11,722
Press all the buttons

1910
01:58:13,186 --> 01:58:14,494
It's open

1911
01:58:15,221 --> 01:58:16,063
Pakya

1912
01:58:16,122 --> 01:58:16,623
What?

1913
01:58:16,756 --> 01:58:17,791
The engine fell out

1914
01:58:18,057 --> 01:58:18,535
What?

1915
01:58:20,693 --> 01:58:22,570
There's no hole underneath

1916
01:58:23,062 --> 01:58:24,097
How did it fall out?

1917
01:58:24,163 --> 01:58:24,664
Back off

1918
01:58:26,132 --> 01:58:27,509
Mohan

1919
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:29,111
The engine's gone

1920
01:58:29,335 --> 01:58:32,578
The engine's in
Shamshu's furnace

1921
01:58:32,705 --> 01:58:34,651
This car's engine is
in the back, you blockhead

1922
01:58:34,807 --> 01:58:36,047
Look in the back

1923
01:58:37,677 --> 01:58:39,384
Pakya, the engine's here

1924
01:58:39,512 --> 01:58:41,617
The engine is safe
in a glass box

1925
01:58:42,115 --> 01:58:44,618
You. How did you know
the engine was in the back?

1926
01:58:44,784 --> 01:58:46,525
This is our boss's car

1927
01:58:46,552 --> 01:58:48,759
We also own an Alto, a Scorpio...

1928
01:58:48,788 --> 01:58:51,098
Tell him, Mohan
- Right

1929
01:58:51,257 --> 01:58:52,759
This is our boss's car.
Move away

1930
01:58:52,825 --> 01:58:54,498
If it's your boss's car...

1931
01:58:54,527 --> 01:58:56,404
tell me why it has stalled

1932
01:58:56,562 --> 01:58:58,098
Well, you see...

1933
01:58:58,264 --> 01:58:59,641
But why should I tell you?

1934
01:58:59,799 --> 01:59:02,075
Yes, who're you to ask?
Move aside

1935
01:59:02,201 --> 01:59:04,374
Go, Head of Security
- Take out the gun

1936
01:59:06,739 --> 01:59:07,717
What's wrong with the car?

1937
01:59:08,441 --> 01:59:11,354
The car's run out of gas

1938
01:59:11,511 --> 01:59:12,251
Now what?

1939
01:59:13,246 --> 01:59:14,452
Let's take gas from that scooter

1940
01:59:15,214 --> 01:59:17,626
Take gas from the scooter,
put it into the car

1941
01:59:17,717 --> 01:59:19,287
It's like this...

1942
01:59:19,619 --> 01:59:22,122
You don't put regular gas
into a Ferrari

1943
01:59:22,355 --> 01:59:24,096
A special kind goes into it

1944
01:59:24,257 --> 01:59:27,670
And only we know
where to get it

1945
01:59:33,332 --> 01:59:34,242
Listen up

1946
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:35,745
Pakya
- Quiet

1947
01:59:36,102 --> 01:59:38,673
Look, I need your help

1948
01:59:39,405 --> 01:59:40,748
This is your boss's Ferrari?

1949
01:59:40,806 --> 01:59:42,683
Get me to my wedding
in this Ferrari

1950
01:59:42,808 --> 01:59:44,754
Once I get there...

1951
01:59:44,877 --> 01:59:48,381
the car's yours.
You can take it back

1952
01:59:48,748 --> 01:59:52,321
If you don't help me,
then this engine...

1953
01:59:52,385 --> 01:59:54,456
No, don't

1954
01:59:54,554 --> 01:59:55,897
How will we get him there?

1955
01:59:56,155 --> 01:59:57,691
The Ferrari is out of gas

1956
01:59:58,558 --> 01:59:59,332
Well?

1957
01:59:59,625 --> 02:00:03,368
The trials of life...

1958
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:06,468
I have an idea

1959
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:09,544
are eased by the Lord

1960
02:00:09,802 --> 02:00:12,681
Mohan, how much
farther is the gas station?

1961
02:00:12,838 --> 02:00:14,818
Why don't you take
the bullock's place?

1962
02:00:15,174 --> 02:00:16,244
We may reach faster

1963
02:00:17,476 --> 02:00:19,285
Any fractures?
- No sir

1964
02:00:42,902 --> 02:00:44,939
Hello, Uncle Pesi?
Rusy here

1965
02:00:45,304 --> 02:00:50,413
Could you please check on
Kayo at my house?

1966
02:00:50,710 --> 02:00:52,189
He's not answering the phone

1967
02:00:52,311 --> 02:00:52,880
Thank you

1968
02:01:01,554 --> 02:01:02,430
He looks fine

1969
02:01:02,722 --> 02:01:04,963
Let's get a CT scan
- OK sir

1970
02:01:08,628 --> 02:01:10,767
Rusy, Kayo is nowhere

1971
02:01:11,364 --> 02:01:11,967
You come home quick

1972
02:01:12,298 --> 02:01:15,336
Those goons were hanging
around for a long time

1973
02:01:29,849 --> 02:01:31,260
Kayo

1974
02:01:33,386 --> 02:01:35,229
Kayo

1975
02:01:40,493 --> 02:01:43,269
Rusy, where're you going?
- They're dangerous guys

1976
02:01:44,230 --> 02:01:51,876
The dawn of auspicious days

1977
02:01:53,739 --> 02:01:57,243
Welcome, my friends
from the Press

1978
02:01:57,610 --> 02:02:02,855
Today, I give 201 couples
a loan-free life

1979
02:02:03,015 --> 02:02:04,824
No. 176 - Please come here

1980
02:02:05,418 --> 02:02:08,456
Of these, 200 are my social work

1981
02:02:08,921 --> 02:02:12,459
And 1 is my homework

1982
02:02:12,758 --> 02:02:13,736
My son Pakya

1983
02:02:16,962 --> 02:02:18,373
The Ferrari

1984
02:02:20,366 --> 02:02:23,040
Prakash Mandke, No. 201

1985
02:02:23,536 --> 02:02:24,869
That brings me to the end...

1986
02:02:24,870 --> 02:02:26,907
TV crews
- Long live India

1987
02:02:27,006 --> 02:02:29,607
Here, look here

1988
02:02:29,608 --> 02:02:31,849
Here
- What's happening?

1989
02:02:32,345 --> 02:02:33,551
Hit it

1990
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:35,784
I will show you...

1991
02:02:35,948 --> 02:02:38,622
I will give you Breaking News

1992
02:02:38,951 --> 02:02:40,430
Here a Pakya...

1993
02:02:40,820 --> 02:02:42,458
there a Pakya

1994
02:02:42,588 --> 02:02:46,458
Reporters, tell me
how many Pakyas?

1995
02:02:46,459 --> 02:02:47,597
So who's the real Pakya?

1996
02:02:47,626 --> 02:02:49,333
Follow me

1997
02:02:50,296 --> 02:02:52,071
You see this groom?

1998
02:02:52,398 --> 02:02:55,379
Now see my dad's social work

1999
02:02:55,468 --> 02:02:56,469
Look at this

2000
02:02:58,971 --> 02:02:59,676
Grandpa

2001
02:02:59,839 --> 02:03:01,648
His grandson is older than me

2002
02:03:02,475 --> 02:03:04,887
That concludes
what I had to say...

2003
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:06,084
Oh no you don't

2004
02:03:08,414 --> 02:03:09,586
Who's this 201 ?

2005
02:03:09,782 --> 02:03:11,455
C'mon 201 , lift your veil

2006
02:03:11,650 --> 02:03:12,685
Show yourself

2007
02:03:12,818 --> 02:03:14,491
What is this?
- Melodrama

2008
02:03:14,653 --> 02:03:17,532
I've learnt from what
I've seen since childhood

2009
02:03:19,024 --> 02:03:20,094
Should I shoot?

2010
02:03:20,359 --> 02:03:21,770
Aren't these your words?

2011
02:03:21,827 --> 02:03:22,965
1...

2012
02:03:23,462 --> 02:03:25,601
Should I shoot... 2...

2013
02:03:26,065 --> 02:03:27,908
Should I shoot? Take this

2014
02:03:28,701 --> 02:03:30,476
What're you doing, son?

2015
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:31,874
Watch it

2016
02:03:32,037 --> 02:03:33,846
It's Babbu didi

2017
02:03:36,942 --> 02:03:39,821
Dad's made
laughing stock of you too

2018
02:03:40,946 --> 02:03:42,357
Pakya, where's my son?

2019
02:03:42,615 --> 02:03:43,787
Look, his son's also missing

2020
02:03:49,054 --> 02:03:50,055
Babbu didi?

2021
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:55,029
Pakya

2022
02:03:55,394 --> 02:03:57,431
Tell me where my son is,
or I'll shoot

2023
02:03:57,496 --> 02:03:59,635
Tell me

2024
02:04:00,366 --> 02:04:02,573
Mom, I don't know
where his son is

2025
02:04:02,601 --> 02:04:04,478
My son would never do that

2026
02:04:04,603 --> 02:04:06,640
He would never kidnap
someone's child

2027
02:04:06,705 --> 02:04:08,685
Rusy, wait

2028
02:04:08,774 --> 02:04:09,946
Where's his son?

2029
02:04:10,009 --> 02:04:11,955
I swear I don't know.
Ask them

2030
02:04:12,011 --> 02:04:13,649
Where's his son?

2031
02:04:13,712 --> 02:04:15,953
When we left, he was
running towards the sea

2032
02:04:16,081 --> 02:04:17,685
And he was crying

2033
02:04:19,084 --> 02:04:22,395
Mom, this guy stole the Ferrari

2034
02:04:22,588 --> 02:04:24,067
His son got to know

2035
02:04:24,490 --> 02:04:27,960
I think he's gone towards
the sea to commit suicide

2036
02:04:27,993 --> 02:04:29,097
Be quiet

2037
02:04:31,030 --> 02:04:33,738
Suicide? Your son's
committed suicide?

2038
02:04:36,769 --> 02:04:39,579
You've lost your son.
How do you feel?

2039
02:04:39,738 --> 02:04:41,547
Do you think he killed himself?

2040
02:04:41,674 --> 02:04:43,711
Where must he be?
- What happened, sir?

2041
02:04:44,043 --> 02:04:48,014
Where is your son?
What is your answer?

2042
02:04:52,751 --> 02:04:53,422
Everyone look here

2043
02:04:53,486 --> 02:04:56,626
If you live near the beach,
please come out of your home

2044
02:04:56,789 --> 02:04:58,063
Please rush to the beach

2045
02:04:58,190 --> 02:05:00,466
If you see a child running,
please stop him

2046
02:05:00,526 --> 02:05:01,766
He's my son, Kayo

2047
02:05:02,061 --> 02:05:03,597
He runs very fast

2048
02:05:03,829 --> 02:05:06,207
Don't let him go near the water

2049
02:05:07,066 --> 02:05:09,137
Not into the sea

2050
02:05:12,605 --> 02:05:14,585
My son's this high

2051
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:16,151
4 feet, 9 inches

2052
02:05:16,575 --> 02:05:18,782
Dusky skin

2053
02:05:19,545 --> 02:05:20,683
This is him

2054
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:22,686
He's always smiling

2055
02:05:23,516 --> 02:05:26,986
Kayoze Rustom Deboo.
His full name

2056
02:05:29,788 --> 02:05:31,734
Kayo, I didn't know what to do

2057
02:05:32,858 --> 02:05:34,496
Couldn't get a loan from work

2058
02:05:34,793 --> 02:05:36,795
The bank refused me a loan

2059
02:05:37,596 --> 02:05:39,473
I didn't mean to steal, Kayo

2060
02:05:40,766 --> 02:05:42,768
I made a mistake

2061
02:05:44,970 --> 02:05:46,711
Grandpa is right

2062
02:05:47,740 --> 02:05:50,152
We shouldn't dream at all

2063
02:05:52,478 --> 02:05:56,085
Please give me back my Kayo.
I can't live without him

2064
02:05:57,983 --> 02:06:01,556
If you want to Contact me,
call me on my phone...

2065
02:06:04,957 --> 02:06:07,198
Listen, you guys
search Girgaum beach

2066
02:06:07,493 --> 02:06:08,938
I'll check Dadar and Juhu beach

2067
02:06:09,762 --> 02:06:12,504
Keep in touch with me.
Call me every 5 minutes

2068
02:06:13,032 --> 02:06:14,807
I'm just leaving home...

2069
02:06:16,535 --> 02:06:18,208
I'll call you back

2070
02:06:20,205 --> 02:06:22,048
Kayo, where have you been?

2071
02:06:24,543 --> 02:06:26,113
Sir, Papa...

2072
02:06:28,614 --> 02:06:33,256
Sir, the police will take
Papa away. Please help me

2073
02:06:34,653 --> 02:06:36,291
Whoever finds my son
can have my apartment

2074
02:06:36,589 --> 02:06:38,923
It has one bedroom
and a large living room

2075
02:06:38,924 --> 02:06:40,992
Just find my son please

2076
02:06:40,993 --> 02:06:41,869
Rusy?

2077
02:06:41,961 --> 02:06:44,840
Please help me

2078
02:06:47,166 --> 02:06:47,871
Hello?

2079
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,707
Rusy

2080
02:06:53,572 --> 02:06:55,848
Papa, Kayo's gone

2081
02:06:56,675 --> 02:06:58,712
Kayo's gone

2082
02:06:59,912 --> 02:07:00,890
Papa

2083
02:07:05,184 --> 02:07:06,094
Papa

2084
02:07:08,153 --> 02:07:09,564
Kayo

2085
02:07:11,090 --> 02:07:12,330
Where were you?

2086
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:23,040
I'm sorry, son

2087
02:07:32,344 --> 02:07:33,823
I'm sorry, Kayo

2088
02:07:36,015 --> 02:07:39,053
I'm really sorry,
I shouldn't have done it

2089
02:07:39,752 --> 02:07:43,029
If I don't go to Lord's,
you think I won't play cricket?

2090
02:07:46,992 --> 02:07:49,370
I have the world's best coach

2091
02:07:50,062 --> 02:07:51,769
He'll train me

2092
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:55,073
And you know, Sachin
didn't train at Lord's

2093
02:07:55,601 --> 02:07:57,740
He trained right here,
at Shivaji Park

2094
02:07:57,970 --> 02:07:59,347
And became the No. 1 cricketer

2095
02:07:59,772 --> 02:08:00,910
I'll be No. 1 too

2096
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:02,846
100 centuries

2097
02:08:05,978 --> 02:08:08,219
Don't be upset, Papa

2098
02:08:08,847 --> 02:08:10,258
C'mon, be a good boy

2099
02:08:13,752 --> 02:08:16,062
Tomorrow, if I tell you
I want to go to the moon...

2100
02:08:16,255 --> 02:08:18,132
will you steal a spaceship
from NASA?

2101
02:08:19,024 --> 02:08:20,833
You understand, Papa?

2102
02:08:22,261 --> 02:08:24,969
I understand, Kayo

2103
02:08:25,998 --> 02:08:28,103
Now you'll say -
Look at the brighter side of life

2104
02:08:28,267 --> 02:08:29,211
Actually yes, Papa

2105
02:08:29,334 --> 02:08:31,905
If I'd gone to Lord's,
I would have gone alone

2106
02:08:32,337 --> 02:08:34,010
When I'm selected
for the Indian team...

2107
02:08:34,139 --> 02:08:35,846
I'll take you with me

2108
02:08:36,108 --> 02:08:37,815
I'll tell the Cricket Board clearly...

2109
02:08:37,876 --> 02:08:40,914
If you want Kayo in the team,
you have to take Papa along

2110
02:08:41,180 --> 02:08:42,955
I can't sleep without you

2111
02:08:43,148 --> 02:08:45,685
And who will wake me
for the match in the morning?

2112
02:08:47,686 --> 02:08:48,994
My Kayo's grown up

2113
02:08:50,856 --> 02:08:52,301
Grown up too soon

2114
02:08:55,728 --> 02:08:57,765
The flight has landed

2115
02:08:58,263 --> 02:08:59,708
Boss is back

2116
02:09:03,202 --> 02:09:05,182
Sorry, but can you
please hurry up?

2117
02:09:05,938 --> 02:09:08,316
Our boss's flight has landed

2118
02:09:08,941 --> 02:09:12,684
We have to take the Ferrari back

2119
02:09:23,255 --> 02:09:26,099
Babbu didi,
please return this money

2120
02:09:28,160 --> 02:09:29,798
Pakya, could you...

2121
02:09:32,765 --> 02:09:33,368
Thank you

2122
02:09:36,168 --> 02:09:37,078
The key, sir

2123
02:09:39,238 --> 02:09:40,478
Please forgive me

2124
02:09:40,873 --> 02:09:43,854
I must ask Sachin
for forgiveness too

2125
02:09:44,143 --> 02:09:46,180
Not today, sir.
We'll handle it from here

2126
02:09:46,411 --> 02:09:47,822
Meet him another day

2127
02:09:47,980 --> 02:09:50,085
You can take a photo
with him too

2128
02:09:50,215 --> 02:09:53,253
Yes. Sorry, got to rush now

2129
02:10:04,429 --> 02:10:05,464
Yes, I'll open it

2130
02:10:06,098 --> 02:10:08,044
Pandey, Boss not back yet?

2131
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:09,042
Boss is back

2132
02:10:09,401 --> 02:10:10,880
When?
- Right now

2133
02:10:11,470 --> 02:10:12,949
Open it, quick

2134
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:32,491
Please don't tell anyone
I gave out the Ferrari key

2135
02:10:32,991 --> 02:10:35,369
Please don't tell anyone
that I opened the gate

2136
02:10:35,527 --> 02:10:37,438
I would've lost my
status in the village

2137
02:10:37,830 --> 02:10:39,468
Saved
- Don't worry

2138
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,001
Well done

2139
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:49,416
Kayo

2140
02:10:50,475 --> 02:10:52,113
You know something?

2141
02:10:53,178 --> 02:10:57,422
You put a ball into a sock
and kept knocking it

2142
02:10:57,883 --> 02:11:01,023
That really irritated me

2143
02:11:02,354 --> 02:11:04,027
Now throw away that rotting sock

2144
02:11:04,223 --> 02:11:06,965
I'll come to the nets.
I will train you

2145
02:11:07,893 --> 02:11:10,430
You will play for India

2146
02:11:10,796 --> 02:11:12,901
You don't need to
go to London

2147
02:11:13,165 --> 02:11:14,940
Those players
should come here

2148
02:11:15,100 --> 02:11:16,579
We could teach
them a thing or two

2149
02:11:19,071 --> 02:11:21,017
Stop here

2150
02:11:22,241 --> 02:11:24,075
C'mon little one,
give me a hand

2151
02:11:24,076 --> 02:11:25,578
Who are these people?

2152
02:11:30,015 --> 02:11:32,518
Uncle Rusy, put Rs. 50 in this

2153
02:11:34,152 --> 02:11:36,564
There you go

2154
02:11:37,956 --> 02:11:39,435
It's done

2155
02:11:41,026 --> 02:11:44,872
We'd collected Rs.149,950

2156
02:11:45,130 --> 02:11:48,976
Now we have the complete
amount of 150,000

2157
02:11:51,169 --> 02:11:52,341
This is for you

2158
02:11:52,537 --> 02:11:53,914
But what is all this?

2159
02:11:54,139 --> 02:11:58,451
Rusy, our Kayo will
go to London now

2160
02:11:59,011 --> 02:12:00,354
Uncle Rusy...

2161
02:12:00,479 --> 02:12:02,925
this lady contributed
the largest bundle

2162
02:12:03,181 --> 02:12:04,387
Come on up

2163
02:12:04,583 --> 02:12:08,861
The gentleman from the bank
also put in a big amount

2164
02:12:09,254 --> 02:12:13,964
And everyone from the colony
brought in 50,000 rupees

2165
02:12:14,226 --> 02:12:16,035
Now where's the gentleman
from the shop?

2166
02:12:16,328 --> 02:12:17,864
I'm here

2167
02:12:18,864 --> 02:12:21,504
And these are the shoes
you had marked

2168
02:12:21,934 --> 02:12:23,004
Kayo

2169
02:12:23,201 --> 02:12:25,909
All of us saw you on TV

2170
02:12:26,171 --> 02:12:28,981
Thank you, but I can't take this

2171
02:12:29,141 --> 02:12:30,313
Why not?

2172
02:12:30,509 --> 02:12:32,455
We're not giving it
to you for nothing

2173
02:12:32,644 --> 02:12:35,215
We all want a ride
in the Ferrari

2174
02:12:36,281 --> 02:12:38,454
But the Ferrari is back
at Sachin's house

2175
02:12:38,517 --> 02:12:40,053
Sachin's Ferrari?

2176
02:12:40,185 --> 02:12:42,028
Want Sachin's Ferrari?
- No

2177
02:12:42,054 --> 02:12:44,000
We don't want Sachin's Ferrari

2178
02:12:44,189 --> 02:12:47,136
We want our Kayo's Ferrari

2179
02:12:47,926 --> 02:12:50,964
Look, he will play for
India some day, right?

2180
02:12:51,029 --> 02:12:52,440
Will he?
- Definitely

2181
02:12:52,497 --> 02:12:54,238
There, Papa has spoken

2182
02:12:54,466 --> 02:12:58,243
So when Kayo plays for India,
won't he buy a Ferrari?

2183
02:12:58,503 --> 02:13:00,278
Won't he?
- Definitely

2184
02:13:00,439 --> 02:13:01,543
Then it's settled

2185
02:13:01,907 --> 02:13:06,287
So this is the rental fee for
Kayo's Ferrari, in advance

2186
02:13:08,046 --> 02:13:09,150
Thank you, but I can't...

2187
02:13:10,549 --> 02:13:14,053
When you get the EPF loan,
return everyone's money

2188
02:13:14,453 --> 02:13:15,932
But I don't know...

2189
02:13:15,954 --> 02:13:17,421
if you'll get the
EPF loan before.”

2190
02:13:17,422 --> 02:13:18,696
you get Kayo's Ferrari

2191
02:13:21,226 --> 02:13:24,002
Hey King of Honesty,
don't think so much

2192
02:13:24,162 --> 02:13:26,972
The signal's turn green.
Zoom off to London

2193
02:13:27,265 --> 02:13:29,404
Hey Champion of Truth,
send him off

2194
02:14:50,715 --> 02:14:53,696
May this mind...

2195
02:14:54,386 --> 02:14:58,698
its thoughts and deeds

2196
02:14:59,324 --> 02:15:03,670
Every stride and step

2197
02:15:04,229 --> 02:15:09,679
Tread the path of Truth

2198
02:15:10,502 --> 02:15:13,711
Stand strong...

2199
02:15:14,306 --> 02:15:18,686
On the tough, honest path

2200
02:15:19,144 --> 02:15:23,524
Ana' remain fearless
and unwavering

2201
02:15:24,049 --> 02:15:26,529
Always, with head held high

2202
02:15:32,290 --> 02:15:33,598
Hurry up, Rusy

2203
02:15:35,560 --> 02:15:37,665
There he is... There's Kayo

2204
02:15:46,171 --> 02:15:48,549
C'mon Kayo

2205
02:16:03,722 --> 02:16:05,360
He's hit a 6...

2206
02:16:05,524 --> 02:16:06,798
Ana' now a 4

2207
02:16:07,192 --> 02:16:09,860
Something zooms up. . .
Look, it's our score!

2208
02:16:09,861 --> 02:16:11,340
Go Kayo

2209
02:16:13,698 --> 02:16:15,332
He's hit a 6...

2210
02:16:15,333 --> 02:16:16,835
Ana' now a 4

2211
02:16:17,135 --> 02:16:20,116
Something zooms up. . .
Look, it's our score!

2212
02:16:20,438 --> 02:16:23,442
The crowds hunger for runs. . .
They gotta have more

2213
02:16:23,675 --> 02:16:26,281
More...

2214
02:16:26,578 --> 02:16:27,852
A big hit
