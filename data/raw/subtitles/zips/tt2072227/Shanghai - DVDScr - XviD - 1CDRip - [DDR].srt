00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,256
I don't want to involve

9
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,357
I gave my word,
If you won't do it then...

10
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,500
You want to send this truck
back to bank

11
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,387
I have no family member

12
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,513

13
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,258

14
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,362
Don't think about it

00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,381
He is Mr. Krishnan Vice Chairman
of I.B.P...

19
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,475
Who doesn't know him?

20
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,254
C.M. Really likes our Kebabs

21
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,447
Sir! Everything is in your hands

22
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,424

25
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,232
It's an emotional matter so

26
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,530

27
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:19,211
He will provoke the issue of
Bharat Nagar land...

28
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,436
He will abuse I.B.P

29
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,247
Collector is my junior

30
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,406
Let's cancel his speech

31
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,279
This Ahemdi has stopped your
Dam Project

32
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,361
You never forget your insult

33
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,225

37
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,224
He was my teacher in America

38
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,295
What?

39
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,392
Ask him not to come here

40
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,397
If he will come here

41
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:25,277
he couldn't go back alive

42
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,420
You are already facing many problems

43
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,298
don't create more problems

44
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,323
Stop him!

45
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,253

46
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:15,260

47
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,498

48
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:32,308
If will tell him then he will
laugh on me

49
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,509
They have cancelled the
Hall's permission

50
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,217
Where are you going?

51
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,480
You are welcome in our city

52
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,449
It has been said that you have
a problem with Chopra

53
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,305
Will you perform a stage show
with Tina...

54
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,434
If she will make hunger fast with me

55
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,314
Do Progress!

56
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,318
But in the name of I.B.P and
progress

57
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:53,449
You through Bharat Nagar people 50
miles away from their houses

58
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:59,330
then you make those Bharat Nagar people
guard and stand at I.B.P's gate

59
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,366
Is this a progress?

60
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:03,427
They can't live with you here

61
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,368
They are black,
Their clothes are dirty

62
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,398
They can't speak english

63
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,239
What kind of progress is this?

64
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,275
Only Mercedes runs and...

65
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,343
cycle not

66
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,438
What is your next movie?

67
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,375
My next movie is about love

68
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,485
What are you doing?

69
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,493
You shouldn't touch the human's feet

70
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,230
We lost the hall

71
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,326
Collector has cancelled the hall
permission...

72
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,463
They have become very smart

73
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,309
So what we do now?
Shall we cancel it?

74
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,275
We won't cancel it...

75
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:04,524
How are you?

76
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,442
So what will you do about my warning?

77
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,386
Warning!

78
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,447
Who gave you the warning?

79
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,491
You are not telling us

80
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,292
Now what we suppose to do?

81
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,224
Tina came from Bharat Nagar

82
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,295
What will you do to know that
who gave the warning?

83
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,399
So what about hall?

84
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,241
Last time where I have attend your
Union Meeting

85
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,301
that Bharat Nagar Police Circle?

86
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,411
That's Morchaa wala's bedroom

87
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,279
I want to shit over there

88
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,393
Morchaa wala gave election issue
to I.B.P Department

89
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,388
If you will speak against I.B.P means
you are against them

90
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,334
Trust me!

91
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,502
You have a natural beauty

92
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,275
People will forget Priyanka Chopra

93
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,443
get few snaps in swim suit and watch

94
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,495
Read it!

95
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,308
Dhable is inside!
They are talking about his analysis

96
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:06,435
You told me to wait outside

97
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,347
If I will ask you to jump in wall so
you will jump

98
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,505
You decide it first

99
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,353
Fix the screen

100
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,391
As you can see the people

101
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,528
You will put the people effect later

102
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,291
Who changed the plan

103
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,363
Turn off the camera

104
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,381
What are you looking at?

105
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,486
They are changing the plan
over and over again

106
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,257
Where?
Police station!

107
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,270
He is talking on phone

108
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,418
I missed you alot in New York

109
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,470
That Sub Inspector from Crime
Branch came again

110
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,359
We thought we should
give you the news

111
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:40,262
Supreme Court has rejected
his bail

112
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,402
It's a fraud of 40 crores

113
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,303
Your father will be imprison
for 8 years

114
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,465
You must have got the call
from the lawyer

115
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,372
Now come at station

116
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,501
Do you have warrant?

117
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,247
Sir!
You are a rich man

118
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,246
Why you are getting involve?

119
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,220
Your photo published
in news papers.

120
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,222
Do you want me to print your photo?

121
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,350
For harrasment case

122
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,400
Tell me may I?

123
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,365
Such an arrogant person

124
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,319
Why did you left New Work?

125
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,490
Have you seen the timings?

126
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,460
He let Madam get up from
the seat

127
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,300
god save us from this collusion

128
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,337
We send the offer from the centre

129
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,272
She refused us for them

130
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,350
Dehli is 2 hours away

131
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,318
but we got news in 2 minutes

132
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,394
They have blocked the way
to hall

133
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,289
How we will go?

134
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,264
Our people is in danger

135
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:19,495
They have entered inside as much
as they can

136
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,412
I am sorry for late

137
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,381
Weather is not well outside...

138
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:40,370
How he is doing?

139
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,429
Can I take him to Dehli?

140
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:12,230
If we will remove his life support

141
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,396
Do you have something else
belongs to him

142
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,291
there was another man
in the truck

143
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,234
Police has just arrested that driver

144
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,273
and they are saying he was drunk
while he was driving

145
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,442
It was not definitely an accident

146
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:54,437
In fact Shalini got the warning

147
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,381
She got warning?

148
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,474
What you done with warning?

149
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,317
If you will speak then
people will listen

150
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:05,354
Media will listen

151
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,323
They will also know that how do they
plan and kill the people

152
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,256
if you will speak anything
against I.B.P

153
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,418
You tell me what he was fighting for?
I am not a doctor

154
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,464
Ask to Airline how to move
him to dehli

155
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:50,434
Are you okay?

156
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,271
Police force were deployed there

157
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:10,386
How some truck can ruin something
in front of police

158
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,324
Why they are claiming it accident

159
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:17,484
why police is not investigating like
an attack

160
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,329
Who has been protecting?

161
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:22,424
I am demanding...

162
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:27,370
that C.B. I should get the inquiry
of attack on my husband

163
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,279
Did you speak with them to
release me?

164
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,291
I have spoke with them

165
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,516
He said he will get you
release soon

166
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:59,392
After deducting diesel amount if you
will give me 30./. So it will be fine

167
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:05,333
My husband is fighting for his life

168
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,436
and until he is fighting

169
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,413
till then I will keep repeating
this question

170
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:14,384
and until we don't get answers...

171
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,283
till then we won't leave this city

172
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,517
Come with me to police station
I don't want to go anywhere

173
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,223
You can't force me

174
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,398
Let's go to the village

175
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,399
We will meet you there.
Come soon!

176
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,245
You don't need to come onjob
from tomorrow

177
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:49,344
My husband is in coma

178
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,252
We are fighting for his life

179
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,457
He is alive

180
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,409
We don't have time for all
these discussions

181
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,337
Before Dehli get involve we shall
take some action

182
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:22,285
I mean I.B.P is in final phase

183
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:23,478
So what should I tell them?

184
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,281
That Krishnan is very busy and he
won't do it...

185
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:36,397
Yes!

186
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:43,306
He is standing in front of me

187
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:45,509
You talk to her

188
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,483
Briefing is in ten minutes,
S.S. P Chauhan will be there

189
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,486
C. M's Political advisor Mr. Avasti
will be also there

190
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:11,234
I want that night's wireless report
station diary

191
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:14,361
And another man was in truck

192
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:15,370
Is he got arrested?

193
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:22,371
But we can't give anyone investigation
detail in public

194
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:27,484
What do you mean?

195
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,483
It's C. M's inquiry
You have no choice

196
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:34,515
Check for the dinner

197
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,440
These are the signed statements

198
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,336
Sir! I will get the fan for you

199
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:39,513
Some Shalini is waiting for
you since morning

200
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,362
So everything was fine
before the accident

201
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:57,462
Yes!

202
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:02,341
Doctor came out and everyone
was very happy

203
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,304
suddenly truck entered inside

204
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,390
And you have requested to send
more force

205
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,326
Sir! I had weak force

206
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,258
there was a V.I. P Movement
in the city

207
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,455
There was a riot after accident

208
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,500
I mean I requested to send
more force

209
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:35,378
But you have requested the force
before accident

210
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:42,341
Crowd Control!

211
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,481
But youjust said it was peace there

212
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:49,314
If it was a peace

213
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:51,290
then why did you request for force?

214
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:53,387
There was something out of control

215
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:56,260
No!
So?

216
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,274
It's department's internal matter

217
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:11,314
Inernal Matter?

218
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:20,423
Sir! Because of less force truck
entered to Chowk

219
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,288
and I will take the responsibility

220
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:28,458
But I don't have orders to answer
in public

221
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,400
Call your S.S. P!

222
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:06,460
If I would get notice that
you will call me here then...

223
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,430
I would go for vacations...

224
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,455
You are the mistress of Vinod!

225
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:07,347
I can't see anything

226
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:10,254
There is no light

227
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:14,362
You should have died where
the light is

228
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:23,303
Take it!

229
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:24,474
See?

230
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,277
Take him to morgue

231
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:31,371
He is alive

232
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,415
If we will take him to hospital
Really?

233
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:36,374
He is Baba Ramdev!

234
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:38,312
He will make dead body dance

235
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:40,447
Call me if he will dance

236
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,263
What happen?

237
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:34,340
He was talking about
cable license

238
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:36,370
then he said he have a tape

239
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:38,381
He said Jackpot!

240
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:40,407
Do you know about him!

241
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:42,478
Did he told you something?

242
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,250
Tell me if you know something

243
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:54,452
He was a fool

244
00:54:33,668 --> 00:54:34,566
Dhamle!

245
00:54:34,769 --> 00:54:37,636
Ask your brother when he will give

246
00:54:41,676 --> 00:54:42,608
In hindi

247
00:54:43,744 --> 00:54:44,733
If you don't know english

248
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,753
This inquiry is just a waste of time

249
00:55:03,764 --> 00:55:06,597
In this state expectingjustice
is a foolish thing

250
00:55:09,704 --> 00:55:11,535
Give me one chance

251
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,799
I will take you to dehli
with chartered flight

252
00:55:16,844 --> 00:55:21,679
Home Minister also wants to meet you

253
00:55:23,584 --> 00:55:24,710
consider on my proposal

254
00:55:31,792 --> 00:55:33,657
You will take me back
to dehli

255
00:55:35,796 --> 00:55:36,785
They don't want to take doctor

256
00:55:37,832 --> 00:55:39,561
but me...

257
00:55:41,635 --> 00:55:43,694
You work with Doctor

258
00:55:44,705 --> 00:55:45,694
I was his student

259
00:55:50,811 --> 00:55:52,642
After marriage

260
00:55:53,614 --> 00:55:55,775
I walked behind him with a flag
till 4 years

261
00:56:00,588 --> 00:56:02,556
We couldn't resettle a single family

262
00:56:03,824 --> 00:56:05,758
then I have started my own work

263
00:56:07,795 --> 00:56:08,727
But...

264
00:56:10,598 --> 00:56:11,724
Who cares for your work here?

265
00:56:12,733 --> 00:56:14,701
People needs Messiah...

266
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:17,567
to kill or die

267
00:56:23,644 --> 00:56:24,770
If you have so much anger so what
are you doing here?

268
00:56:28,649 --> 00:56:29,616
What will I do?

269
00:56:30,718 --> 00:56:31,776
Some realjob

270
00:56:33,654 --> 00:56:35,588
Or you will wait sitting here that

271
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:38,649
when Messiah will open his eyes
and call your name

272
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,687
Get your clothes

273
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:31,505
I wanted to talk to you

274
00:57:32,646 --> 00:57:33,772
I am leaving

275
00:57:38,686 --> 00:57:39,710
I will talk to you tomorrow

276
00:57:49,563 --> 00:57:50,689
You were shooting there...

277
00:57:51,632 --> 00:57:53,532
We will show that footage in
commission

278
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:03,576
We will prove that everyone was from
Morcha there that night

279
00:58:13,754 --> 00:58:17,554
I want your footage from that night

280
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:19,751
To show the commission

281
00:58:23,597 --> 00:58:24,655
I don't want to get involve

282
00:58:41,549 --> 00:58:43,744
You don't care if they have killed a
person like your brother

283
00:58:49,557 --> 00:58:50,649
Or it was an accident

284
00:58:58,666 --> 00:58:59,655
Wherever you came from

285
00:59:00,668 --> 00:59:01,635
England, America!

286
00:59:02,603 --> 00:59:03,570
Go back!

287
00:59:04,638 --> 00:59:06,538
It's India,
It won't suit you

288
00:59:11,745 --> 00:59:12,643
Why?

289
00:59:33,567 --> 00:59:34,591
Do it whatever you want

290
00:59:35,803 --> 00:59:37,532
but do it now

291
00:59:42,643 --> 00:59:43,667
I want that footage

292
01:00:04,598 --> 01:00:05,622
Tomorrow is his birthday...

293
01:00:06,767 --> 01:00:07,756
They all will come there again

294
01:00:09,803 --> 01:00:11,600
They have called me to shoot
the video

295
01:00:13,674 --> 01:00:15,539
Show that footage to that Madrasi

296
01:00:31,725 --> 01:00:32,714
Be careful!

297
01:00:33,827 --> 01:00:35,590
Otherwise they will set the inquiry

298
01:00:35,763 --> 01:00:38,664
that why you didn't control the
government's shuttlecock

299
01:00:40,534 --> 01:00:41,558
You have to win

300
01:00:42,636 --> 01:00:44,570
Sir! Junior says that everything
was fine

301
01:00:44,805 --> 01:00:46,568
Boss says that crowd was
out of control

302
01:00:46,707 --> 01:00:48,607
How do somebody write a
perfect report

303
01:00:48,709 --> 01:00:49,767
Then write down the same

304
01:00:50,744 --> 01:00:52,678
that police communication was bad

305
01:00:53,547 --> 01:00:54,809
and recommend to buy some
wireless sets

306
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:58,518
and thatjunior is accepting
his mistake

307
01:00:58,619 --> 01:00:59,608
he is ready for punishment

308
01:00:59,787 --> 01:01:01,550
Make him your bait

309
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,558
And don't make it more complicated
Finish it!

310
01:01:26,714 --> 01:01:29,547
There is only one tender in
Art Institute file

311
01:01:30,784 --> 01:01:32,615
Send other tenders...

312
01:01:38,759 --> 01:01:40,556
I have remind them many times

313
01:01:40,694 --> 01:01:41,718
They are not taking seriously

314
01:01:45,766 --> 01:01:46,824
Turn the car.

315
01:01:48,802 --> 01:01:49,826
Bharat Nagar Police Station

316
01:02:00,748 --> 01:02:01,772
Who is Incharge?

317
01:02:02,783 --> 01:02:03,772
Call him!

318
01:02:09,723 --> 01:02:11,554
Sir! I will have to check from
previous records

319
01:02:17,598 --> 01:02:18,587
check the date of this application

320
01:02:18,832 --> 01:02:20,527
It's one week earlier

321
01:02:20,734 --> 01:02:22,565
If you didn't check yet

322
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:24,762
If you have checked...

323
01:02:25,572 --> 01:02:26,834
and you have stopped from higher
authorities then it's their mistake

324
01:02:27,775 --> 01:02:28,799
and it's your mistake again

325
01:02:30,611 --> 01:02:31,737
that you didn't inform me
in written

326
01:02:35,649 --> 01:02:37,583
Finally it's your mistake

327
01:02:39,787 --> 01:02:40,811
Where is the station diary?

328
01:04:07,574 --> 01:04:08,541
What are you shooting there?

329
01:04:08,709 --> 01:04:09,676
Scene is here...

330
01:04:10,744 --> 01:04:11,802
I am shooting the entire thing

331
01:04:21,722 --> 01:04:23,553
you don't pick up my phone these days

332
01:04:25,792 --> 01:04:26,781
I will get you some mutton...

333
01:09:42,742 --> 01:09:43,709
[Skipped item nr. 69]

334
01:16:35,688 --> 01:16:36,655
Now what do you want?

335
01:16:36,823 --> 01:16:38,791
I have got some money for
Kumod's wife

336
01:16:41,628 --> 01:16:42,686
I am going back tonight

337
01:17:04,784 --> 01:17:05,751
From that side

338
01:17:09,722 --> 01:17:10,780
come out!

339
01:17:49,562 --> 01:17:50,654
You were sleeping or dead?

340
01:17:54,567 --> 01:17:55,534
Now listen!

341
01:17:57,770 --> 01:17:59,738
Money is not everything

342
01:18:01,741 --> 01:18:02,799
And you have no idea about life

343
01:18:03,609 --> 01:18:05,509
But life system is not like that...

344
01:20:20,613 --> 01:20:22,672
How do police can suspend
c.M. O's inquiry

345
01:20:25,618 --> 01:20:26,642
We got orders from c.M. O

346
01:20:26,853 --> 01:20:28,616
Mr. Kaul has signed it

347
01:20:35,728 --> 01:20:36,786
We will have to go from back door

348
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:38,688
I can't assure your safety

349
01:20:38,764 --> 01:20:39,731
Then call more force

350
01:20:41,667 --> 01:20:43,794
On VIP duty...
c. M is coming

351
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:55,644
Nothing!

352
01:20:57,617 --> 01:20:58,549
Everything is over

353
01:21:07,727 --> 01:21:08,751
When your next train is?

354
01:21:12,832 --> 01:21:14,561
Who is in Jodhpur?

355
01:21:20,573 --> 01:21:21,699
Then how come you are here?

356
01:21:25,678 --> 01:21:26,667
It was a girl's matter

357
01:21:28,781 --> 01:21:29,770
In Rajpoots...

358
01:21:31,817 --> 01:21:32,806
everything works...

359
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:38,716
One day we got news...

360
01:21:39,792 --> 01:21:41,589
that her family member
is coming to kill me

361
01:21:42,828 --> 01:21:45,661
My father said that take this money

362
01:21:46,832 --> 01:21:48,527
he opened up the back door

363
01:21:50,636 --> 01:21:51,568
and he said...

364
01:21:54,573 --> 01:21:55,597
Want to escape or fight?

365
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:08,652
Who is kuku?

366
01:22:09,655 --> 01:22:10,553
My papa!

367
01:22:18,764 --> 01:22:20,664
Grandma doesn't likes today's time

368
01:22:36,849 --> 01:22:37,816
Yes!

369
01:22:41,687 --> 01:22:42,619
What should I do?

370
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:55,698
Stay there!

371
01:22:56,669 --> 01:22:57,693
And don't open the door

372
01:23:01,774 --> 01:23:02,672
Who was that?

373
01:23:06,612 --> 01:23:08,705
She told me that doctor's life
is in danger

374
01:23:19,592 --> 01:23:21,560
Bharat Nagar!
Are you mad?

375
01:24:36,669 --> 01:24:37,601
How are you?

376
01:24:38,671 --> 01:24:39,729
Ma'am called me...

377
01:24:40,806 --> 01:24:41,738
Little bit more!

378
01:25:30,723 --> 01:25:32,520
Home Minster is here

379
01:25:33,626 --> 01:25:35,753
Now let's go it's his prayer's time

380
01:26:15,668 --> 01:26:16,692
How is beena?

381
01:26:18,637 --> 01:26:20,628
It's her 5th month...
6th!

382
01:35:36,795 --> 01:35:37,762
Mr, Krishnan!

383
01:35:42,834 --> 01:35:44,734
Help me!

384
01:35:44,770 --> 01:35:46,670
My life is in danger!

385
01:35:52,644 --> 01:35:53,668
What you are showing me?

386
01:35:53,812 --> 01:35:55,677
Sir!
I don't know

387
01:35:55,747 --> 01:35:56,736
I am also watching for
the first time

388
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:02,712
What was the date?
Of what?

389
01:36:02,788 --> 01:36:05,586
When they have attacked him?
11...

390
01:36:23,775 --> 01:36:25,640
Who changed the plan?

391
01:36:32,651 --> 01:36:33,675
I have told you

392
01:36:34,686 --> 01:36:35,675
But you said no

393
01:36:36,755 --> 01:36:38,620
Now he will change the plan
thousand times.

394
01:36:49,668 --> 01:36:50,760
Leave it on me

395
01:36:59,611 --> 01:37:01,602
Last time if you won't give up then

396
01:37:01,746 --> 01:37:03,805
till then I would have killed Doctor

397
01:37:06,751 --> 01:37:08,651
Have patience

398
01:37:10,722 --> 01:37:11,654
Turn it off!

399
01:37:15,827 --> 01:37:17,556
Sir!
It will also work

400
01:37:18,697 --> 01:37:20,688
He is talking about to kill someone

401
01:37:22,667 --> 01:37:23,793
Sir!
He is our reach!

402
01:37:24,703 --> 01:37:25,795
Don't let him go!

403
01:39:13,745 --> 01:39:15,713
Sir! You said to finish the report soon

404
01:39:16,581 --> 01:39:17,673
I have done it,
We will talk later

405
01:39:17,816 --> 01:39:19,545
I have got few more evidences

406
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:29,618
What were you saying?

407
01:39:35,567 --> 01:39:38,661
C.M. Has planned with Desh Nayak
and killed Dr. Ahmedi

408
01:39:40,572 --> 01:39:42,597
Inquiry commission was just a game

409
01:39:43,742 --> 01:39:44,731
Did you aware that?

410
01:39:49,714 --> 01:39:50,612
Tell me!

411
01:39:51,583 --> 01:39:51,844
People are around

412
01:39:56,721 --> 01:39:57,653
Are you mad?

413
01:40:00,825 --> 01:40:03,589
I won't listen your nonsense one
more second

414
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:06,719
You are already listening

415
01:40:08,666 --> 01:40:09,690
Now you will do it

416
01:40:10,802 --> 01:40:12,565
You will contact Dehli

417
01:40:13,538 --> 01:40:15,665
You will tell them that you
got this evidence

418
01:40:15,740 --> 01:40:16,707
And you will recommend

419
01:40:16,808 --> 01:40:18,639
that Governer shall ask
c. M's resignation

420
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:21,608
And Government of India shall start
criminal case against him

421
01:40:24,649 --> 01:40:25,547
Who are you?

422
01:40:28,853 --> 01:40:31,788
Who you are to giving me
this order?

423
01:40:34,726 --> 01:40:39,663
Krishnan!
I will ruin your career and future

424
01:40:42,801 --> 01:40:44,598
You won't do anything

425
01:40:45,804 --> 01:40:49,501
You know that I will never talk to you
like that without assurance

426
01:40:51,709 --> 01:40:53,768
That Heart Institute's Land requirement

427
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:56,638
that doesn't come from c.M. O

428
01:40:57,649 --> 01:40:59,549
You also know where it
comes from

429
01:41:01,653 --> 01:41:02,745
It's a prime location land

430
01:41:04,556 --> 01:41:06,751
It has been offered in cheap prices
and you approved it

431
01:41:07,826 --> 01:41:10,761
Only one company filled the tender
Garima Developer

432
01:41:11,563 --> 01:41:12,552
You approved it

433
01:41:12,797 --> 01:41:15,561
Your father in law is the 23% Share
holder of the company

434
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:17,529
but still you approved it

435
01:41:21,673 --> 01:41:23,573
I don't know anyone else smarter
than you

436
01:41:24,742 --> 01:41:25,800
Show your smartness

437
01:41:26,811 --> 01:41:27,778
and do it like I said,

438
01:41:29,681 --> 01:41:31,649
Otherwise c.M. Shall go or not but
I will must send you back

439
01:41:36,621 --> 01:41:37,713
This is not the right way

440
01:41:39,624 --> 01:41:40,648
We will sit tomorrow

441
01:41:41,793 --> 01:41:43,658
There is no tomorrow nor
I drink

442
01:41:50,702 --> 01:41:52,795
Don't play this game with me

443
01:41:53,805 --> 01:41:56,638
I have played this game alot
I am warning you

444
01:42:34,612 --> 01:42:36,807
There is a message from Principle
Secretary

445
01:42:45,823 --> 01:42:47,620
Mr. Kaul...

446
01:42:48,626 --> 01:42:49,752
got strong evidence

447
01:42:51,563 --> 01:42:53,622
that Dr. Ahmedi's accident
wasn't only accident

448
01:42:54,699 --> 01:42:55,631
It was an attack

449
01:43:00,772 --> 01:43:02,535
c.M. Was involved in that attack

450
01:43:03,575 --> 01:43:04,564
She was directly involved

451
01:43:17,622 --> 01:43:18,782
He wants...

452
01:43:19,691 --> 01:43:22,592
that he shall hand over all those
evidences to Government of India

453
01:43:27,532 --> 01:43:28,794
He is just asking the protection

454
01:43:39,811 --> 01:43:42,712
If this matter will reveal after that
college announcement

455
01:43:45,717 --> 01:43:47,582
then it will be not good for you

456
01:43:53,758 --> 01:43:54,690
Send it

457
01:44:03,801 --> 01:44:05,666
Mr. Kaul was also saying that

458
01:44:07,672 --> 01:44:10,607
If we shall inform the Home Minister

459
01:44:12,777 --> 01:44:14,506
if something will be leak then...

460
01:44:27,592 --> 01:44:28,581
I will do it...

461
01:44:44,809 --> 01:44:46,674
He is calling Home Minister

462
01:44:49,681 --> 01:44:50,773
You have two minutes

463
01:44:52,617 --> 01:44:53,584
Election is near

464
01:44:54,552 --> 01:44:55,644
Dehli will get I.B.P

465
01:44:56,554 --> 01:44:57,612
and you will get ticket

466
01:45:03,695 --> 01:45:04,787
That's yourjustice

467
01:45:10,768 --> 01:45:12,668
This c. M could become P. M...

468
01:45:13,805 --> 01:45:15,739
We could go beyond china...
