1
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,292
Good morning, Raj sir.

2
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:09,417
Good morning, Raj sir.
- Good morning.

3
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:10,251
Where's Veer?

4
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:12,126
He's taken Jerry's
car out for test-drive.

5
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:14,167
Okay. Good. Good.

6
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:16,667
Hi, good morning, Raj.

7
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:18,834
Good morning, Raj.

8
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:29,417
Raj...

9
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:34,209
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

10
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:41,209
It's been 15 years since
that incident occurred, Raj.

11
00:02:45,084 --> 00:02:46,709
Oh, God. Save me.

12
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,876
Spare me... Don't beat me.

13
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:49,626
Hey...

14
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:50,584
Listen to me.

15
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:52,667
What are you all doing?

16
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,167
Stop.

17
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:55,584
Why are you all beating him?

18
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,709
Stop, please. Why are you beating him?

19
00:02:57,792 --> 00:03:00,459
Raj, he stole Mr. Almeda's
cellphone and was trying to flee.

20
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:04,167
Why do you do such humiliating
things in the first place?

21
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:08,042
Whatever I have done,
is not my choice.

22
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:09,251
It's my helplessness.

23
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:10,459
What helplessness?

24
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:12,667
Alcohol...or gambling?
- Shakti!

25
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:13,667
Let him speak.

26
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,292
I admit that I stole from him...

27
00:03:16,376 --> 00:03:19,626
But it's not for me.
I did it for my younger brother.

28
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,501
For your brother?
- Yes.

29
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:24,251
After my parents died...

30
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:27,084
...he became entirely my responsibility.

31
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,459
I take care of him by stealing.

32
00:03:30,584 --> 00:03:33,334
Why do you steal...to
take care of your brother?

33
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:34,417
You should do some work.

34
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:36,209
I am not educated.

35
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:37,667
A good-for-nothing loser.

36
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:39,459
What else can I do other
than steal from people?

37
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:41,042
Come and take a peak in my home.

38
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:43,709
I've a house,
but no money to pay rent.

39
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:46,834
There's a bulb, but no electricity.

40
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,376
Please...don't cry.

41
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,667
Shakti, give me your wallet please.

42
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:53,042
Please relax.

43
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:53,917
I...

44
00:03:54,084 --> 00:03:54,876
Here.

45
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:57,084
Keep this money.
- No...

46
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,209
No, Actually, keep all of it.

47
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:01,417
In case you need more,
then that's my house.

48
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:02,792
You can come anytime.

49
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,042
You're giving money to this Mani.

50
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:08,542
But I stole...
- For your brother!

51
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,501
And when it's about your brother...

52
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,917
...one thinks from the heart,
and not mind.

53
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:48,501
Veer...what are you doing?

54
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:51,209
If anything happens to the car
before delivering it to Jerry, then...

55
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:53,584
...Raj and Shakti will skin us alive.

56
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,876
Chill, Siddhu.

57
00:04:55,084 --> 00:04:56,501
I worked really hard
to modify this car.

58
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:58,042
I won't let a single scratch on it.

59
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,334
Enjoy the ride boy.

60
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,626
She's coming this way.

61
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:29,459
I think she needs a lift.
- You're not offering a lift to that girl.

62
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:31,501
Why? - You know what
brother always says.

63
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:33,417
What?
- Girls spell trouble.

64
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:35,584
She's standing there all alone.
- I'm calling him up.

65
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:37,626
Don't be crazy...
- Are you driving or should I call him?

66
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:38,792
Fine, I'm going.

67
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,792
Lift

68
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:44,376
That was a really nice
and tall girl you made me miss.

69
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:45,584
Just keep driving quietly.

70
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:47,334
Brothers bootlicker.
- What?

71
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,459
What now, Veer?

72
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,126
I need to pee.
- Pee? What?

73
00:05:56,251 --> 00:05:57,376
Come along and give me some company.

74
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:58,917
This is not some couple-dance.

75
00:05:59,084 --> 00:05:59,917
And I don't need to do it.

76
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:01,751
You'll feel like doing it while
after watching and hearing me do it.

77
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:02,584
Come on.

78
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,292
Now?
- Not yet.

79
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:08,126
<i>Now '2
' N“ yen!</i>

80
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:11,292
Now?
- Yeah...

81
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:13,959
Well, not me.
- Veer. Veer.

82
00:06:14,084 --> 00:06:15,626
Concentrate on your peeing,
someone might see you.

83
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:18,126
Veer...where are you going?

84
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:19,376
Bye.

85
00:06:19,584 --> 00:06:20,542
Veer!

86
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,959
Hi.
- Hi.

87
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:33,584
Ishita.
- Veer! Can I help you?

88
00:06:33,751 --> 00:06:35,126
Actually, my scooter broke-down!

89
00:06:35,251 --> 00:06:36,917
Oh no.
- I was heading to the Municipal Office.

90
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:38,459
You see, I am from Bangalore.

91
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:39,959
And I need to submit these papers...

92
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,209
...in order to open
a restaurant in Panjim.

93
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:42,334
And today's the last day.

94
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:44,209
The office will close
down in 10 minutes.

95
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:46,792
Can you please give me a lift?
- Let me hold you first.

96
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:48,876
Huh?
- I mean the car-door...

97
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,584
...so I can open it for you.
Please come.

98
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:03,667
Oh, God! Traffic!

99
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:05,459
What now?

100
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:08,292
Don't worry!

101
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:14,709
Watch out!

102
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:33,501
Thank God it's open.

103
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:34,834
Veer, you just made my day!

104
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:36,334
Thank you so much!

105
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:40,292
It's okay, it was my duty.

106
00:07:40,584 --> 00:07:42,126
Bye.
- Bye!

107
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:51,209
Hello.
- Veer.

108
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:52,376
Yes, brother.
- Jerry had called

109
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:53,584
Where is his car?
- Yes...

110
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:55,959
And is everything okay?
- Yes, the car's...

111
00:07:57,917 --> 00:07:58,626
Is fine!

112
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:03,209
Look, Raj...if Veer was fast...

113
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:04,417
...doesn't mean you should get furious.

114
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:05,584
Cool it , Raj.

115
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:06,792
Chill, Raj.

116
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:07,876
Cool down, Raj?

117
00:08:08,042 --> 00:08:10,292
Should I go cozy-up in the fridge now?

118
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:13,334
How did this happen?
What was the reason?

119
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,792
Brother, I...
- Pee.

120
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:16,167
Pee?

121
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:19,959
He said he needs to pee...
and I should give him company.

122
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,417
As soon I started
peeing...he ran off. - Where?

123
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:26,459
I guess he went looking
for an open space.

124
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:28,959
Raj, peeing out in
the open is too much fun.

125
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:29,584
Disgusting Anwar...

126
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,542
Please don't discuss
your personal habits here.

127
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:33,417
How did this happen, Veer?

128
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:35,209
Brother, all this happened...

129
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:36,834
...because I was trying
to help a helpless girl.

130
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:38,417
Helpless girl?
- Yes.

131
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:40,876
Poor girl had to get
to the Corporation Office.

132
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:42,209
She had a deadline to meet

133
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:44,542
I gave her a lift, and in a haste...

134
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,167
And brother, you always taught me...

135
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,376
...I should always be good,
even with the bad.

136
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:49,376
Sol...

137
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:52,042
And if it concerns a girl, then...

138
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:54,626
...even if you've to smash the car,
but still...

139
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,376
...you must go out
of your way to help her.

140
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:57,251
No, no...

141
00:08:59,084 --> 00:09:01,917
What are you laughing at?
- But I was only peeing.

142
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,126
That's all he's capable for.

143
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:06,042
Brother Shakti...
Pee

144
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:13,042
Tavde...get the screwdriver.

145
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:15,376
Yeah.

146
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:16,876
Can I leave?

147
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:19,709
I've to take my girlfriend for dinner.

148
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,042
Fine, go...but don't
wear shorts on your date.

149
00:09:22,251 --> 00:09:23,251
Thank you.

150
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:27,209
Pintu. I can't seem to open this.
- Can I go too?

151
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,376
Where do you have to go?

152
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:31,376
I am taking Tavde and
his girlfriend out to dinner.

153
00:09:31,876 --> 00:09:33,001
Fine, go.
- Thank you.

154
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:35,042
Be on time tomorrow.
- Yeah.

155
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:42,251
Excuse me.

156
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:44,251
Veer.

157
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,126
Ishu.
-lshu?

158
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:48,126
What are you doing here?
- Same old story.

159
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:50,626
My scooter breakdowns
more often than I can count.

160
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:52,792
I'll check, I'm a professional.
- Okay

161
00:10:02,626 --> 00:10:05,626
lshu, it's got a serious issue.
- Really?

162
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:08,626
So now? - Do one thing
Give me your address.

163
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:10,834
I'll fix your scooter and
enter your house to deliver it

164
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:11,501
Huh!

165
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:14,626
Did you get your paperwork done?
- Oh that, yes!

166
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:15,959
Thanks to you.

167
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:19,126
Are you a mechanic?
- Mechanic.

168
00:10:19,334 --> 00:10:20,334
I am the owner of this place...

169
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:22,251
The whole and sole of this place.

170
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:24,251
But all this is because of you.

171
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:25,834
Because of me?

172
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,876
In order to drop you
at the Corporation Office...

173
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:30,334
...this is what happened to the car.

174
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:33,251
And due to that...this
is what my brother has done to me.

175
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:35,042
Day and night...just work.

176
00:10:35,126 --> 00:10:37,126
Oh I am So sorry!

177
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:40,334
I feel so bad for you Veer.

178
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:42,792
You feel for me?

179
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:44,459
Yeah...it's because of me

180
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:47,251
Come here.
Sit here. Here!

181
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:50,751
Who are you?
- Huh!

182
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:55,459
But yet...my heart wants to
share its personal feelings with you.

183
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:57,334
Go ahead, Veer.

184
00:10:57,501 --> 00:10:58,876
Do you know what brother did...

185
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:00,792
...after seeing the
car in this condition?

186
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:01,792
What did he do?

187
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:04,626
He slapped me 10 times
in front of everyone.

188
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:06,626
Yes.
- How humiliating.

189
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:07,834
Didn't you stop him?

190
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,459
He's my elder brother.

191
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:10,834
I can't...

192
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:13,751
It still pains.
- Let me see..

193
00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:15,834
But I don't see any marks?

194
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,334
These are not exam papers
where you get to see marks.

195
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:20,084
Silly girl, it's on the inside.

196
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:21,167
You know what, lshu...

197
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:24,376
...since the time I was a kid,
I loved studying.

198
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,751
But my brother...squandered
my entire education money...

199
00:11:27,876 --> 00:11:30,251
...on his girlfriend Uma Bai.

200
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:33,292
Why didn't you ever retaliate?
Confront him?

201
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,459
You should, Veer!

202
00:11:37,751 --> 00:11:39,542
What "You Should"?

203
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:42,626
This woman's been provoking
me all the while. - Veer?

204
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:45,792
I won't hear another
wrong word against my brother.

205
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:47,334
He's my elder brother.
- Yeah! Yeah!

206
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:48,959
You crazy woman!
She's mad!

207
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,459
Really?
- I don't know her.

208
00:11:54,126 --> 00:11:56,126
Oh...so he's your brother!

209
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:57,792
What kind of a brother are you?

210
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,251
You made him quit his studies.

211
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:00,876
And who hits his younger
brother like this.

212
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:02,376
Aren't you ashamed?

213
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:04,834
He won't tolerate this anymore.
Get that? - Okay.

214
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:06,042
Veer, come here.

215
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,292
Don't be scared.
- No.

216
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:09,751
Vent out all of your anger.
- Vent it out.

217
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:11,459
Come on, Veer...be your name.

218
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:12,959
Come on, Veer...be your name!

219
00:12:13,126 --> 00:12:14,834
Say it.
- Say it!

220
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:17,876
I...

221
00:12:25,126 --> 00:12:26,751
Actually...he wants to say that...

222
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,876
...his heart doesn't agree to this.

223
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:30,126
He wants you to leave.

224
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:34,126
If I fold my hands and apologies
in front of you. He won't like it

225
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:35,292
After all, he's my younger brother.

226
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:36,542
But don't worry.

227
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:39,334
I'll apologies a lot to him.

228
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,334
Fine.
- Thank you.

229
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:43,251
But you don't be scared.

230
00:12:43,334 --> 00:12:45,667
If there's any problem, just call me.

231
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:48,792
You have my number, don't you?
- You do, don't you?

232
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:49,501
Good...good...

233
00:12:49,626 --> 00:12:51,834
Don't worry, he won't need it.

234
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,959
I am sorry. I am sorry, brother.

235
00:12:57,126 --> 00:12:59,959
Who was the girl? You're always cooking up
stories after meeting a girl, aren't you?

236
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:02,334
Come on. Let's go have dinner.
- No, brother.

237
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:07,376
I've sworn...l won't eat a
morsel until I don't fix this car.

238
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:09,834
No, Veer. You can't do that.

239
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:11,376
How can you stay hungry all night?

240
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:12,834
Don't be so hard on yourself, please.

241
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,626
Veer, here's your
double-chicken burger.

242
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:17,792
Hi, brother.
- Hi.

243
00:13:19,251 --> 00:13:21,292
Is this yours?
- No!

244
00:13:23,126 --> 00:13:26,501
You know...l can change
any car in this world...

245
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,459
But not you.

246
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,542
Goodnight, brother.
- Goodnight.

247
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:34,167
Come on.

248
00:13:34,376 --> 00:13:36,542
Brother took your burger.

249
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:37,792
Should I get more for you?

250
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:40,167
I've seen lshita,
I'm not hungry anymore.

251
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:42,126
Come on, Have this coffee now

252
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:44,292
After all,
you've to stay awake all night.

253
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:49,126
You're so concerned about me?
- Veer. I am your bro.

254
00:13:50,126 --> 00:13:51,376
Okay?

255
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:55,167
Come on now, do your work properly.
And don't forget to drink your coffee.

256
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,126
Okay. Take care.

257
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:04,334
Ishu...l am already missing you.

258
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:05,876
Oh my, God!

259
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:31,459
"O Girl... 0 Damsel."

260
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:33,876
"When I saw you move..."

261
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:35,626
"...my heart raced ahead..."

262
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,876
"...like a Olympic runner."

263
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:41,376
"Emotions evoked in my heart."

264
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:43,792
"Emotions evoked in my heart."

265
00:14:43,876 --> 00:14:46,001
"Emotions evoked in my heart."

266
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:48,376
"Emotions evoked in my heart."

267
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:53,167
"My heart's move from its place."

268
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,751
"Shattered into pieces..."

269
00:14:56,834 --> 00:15:00,167
"Like some gum you chew on."

270
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:02,751
"Emotions evoked in my heart."

271
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:05,084
"Emotions evoked in my heart."

272
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:07,792
"Emotions evoked in my heart."

273
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:09,959
"Emotions evoked in my heart."

274
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:13,209
"Beloved . ..my traditional,
typical beloved."

275
00:15:13,334 --> 00:15:15,542
"The cool shade in the scorching sun."

276
00:15:15,626 --> 00:15:18,667
"I sway to the beat."

277
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:20,751
"Beloved."

278
00:15:23,334 --> 00:15:25,459
"My beloved."

279
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:28,167
"Beloved."

280
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:32,876
"My heart's stuck in a whirlpool."

281
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:35,001
"Hear me out in detail."

282
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:37,584
"I've lost everything in love."

283
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:42,334
"Tell me why my feelings..."

284
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:47,042
"...means so low in your heart."

285
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:52,001
"Why didn't you show up...
after promising me?"

286
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:54,084
"The heart stayed up all night.."

287
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:59,084
"...after this sweet betrayal."

288
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,459
"Emotions evoked in my heart."

289
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:03,792
"Emotions evoked in my heart."

290
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:06,126
"Emotions evoked in my heart."

291
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:08,792
"Emotions evoked in my heart."

292
00:16:08,876 --> 00:16:12,001
"Beloved . ..my traditional,
typical beloved."

293
00:16:12,126 --> 00:16:14,334
"The cool shade in the scorching sun."

294
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:17,376
"I sway to the beat."

295
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:21,292
"Beloved . ..my traditional,
typical beloved."

296
00:16:21,376 --> 00:16:23,667
"The cool shade in the scorching sun."

297
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:26,751
"I sway to the beat."

298
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:28,209
"Beloved."

299
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:33,751
Good morning.

300
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:38,751
Veer... Son, take a look.

301
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,417
Another robbery?
- Yes.

302
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:47,376
The music system's gone.
- Yes.

303
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:49,667
I fell asleep again.
- No!

304
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,709
It got stolen even though
you were on watch, son.

305
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:55,459
Exactly...who keeps
stealing at our place?

306
00:16:55,751 --> 00:16:57,542
Oscar bhai.

307
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:02,167
Hi my cool...like an
empty swimming pool.

308
00:17:02,584 --> 00:17:03,667
Come to your papa.

309
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:07,126
Here's your BMW 5 Series
Hi-fi music system.

310
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,959
That's more like it.

311
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:11,459
You know how to pull ropes...

312
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,417
...Like Dominoes and Pizza Hut.

313
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:15,709
You get things so easily...

314
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:19,459
...almost like you're
stealing from your own home.

315
00:17:19,626 --> 00:17:23,667
There's no talent like you here,
Sony Moserbaer.

316
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,792
Oscar bhai...if you're
so impressed by my talent...

317
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:28,792
...then how about you
give me some bonus.

318
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:32,001
You see...it's my girlfriend's birthday,
I want to impress her.

319
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,126
Of course... Of course...

320
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:37,001
Because today it's
also my sister's birthday.

321
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:39,917
Hello, Jenny.

322
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:42,126
Baby I've made arrangements
for the evening birthday party.

323
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:43,709
Wow! Wait, hold on.

324
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:46,376
I'll ask my brother first.
- Yes, okay.

325
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:50,626
Hello.
- Hello, brother.

326
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:53,292
Speak up my dear Laado...
Rolex, Rado.

327
00:17:53,376 --> 00:17:55,709
My friends have arranged
a birthday party for me.

328
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:57,876
Can I go with them?
- Of course, without a doubt.

329
00:17:58,084 --> 00:17:59,917
Go live your life.

330
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:04,126
Here you go...Pampers, huggies.

331
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:08,459
Hi.
- Hi, Veer.

332
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:11,417
I've fixed your scooter.
- Oh, great.

333
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:12,584
Thanks.

334
00:18:13,084 --> 00:18:15,126
How much money do I owe you?
- What money?

335
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:16,709
You don't charge your kin.

336
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:19,001
How sweet.
- Okay.

337
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:21,001
Bye.
- Goodnight.

338
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,001
Goodnight.

339
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:31,876
What's wrong, Veer?
Are you waiting for someone?

340
00:18:32,126 --> 00:18:34,501
My friends were coming here
to pick me up.

341
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:36,251
I'd given them your address...

342
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:38,251
Wonder why they haven't arrived yet.
I don't know.

343
00:18:38,376 --> 00:18:39,709
I'm sure they must be on their way.

344
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:43,167
By the way, if you want...we
can have coffee together.

345
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:45,126
Together, what?
- Coffee!

346
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:49,917
Actually, Veer...l was thinking
about you before you got here.

347
00:18:50,084 --> 00:18:51,126
What?

348
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,959
I mean...your brother

349
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:55,459
How can he? Seriously Veer

350
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:59,584
I've never seen anyone so insensitive
and selfish like your brother.

351
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:02,626
How can any brother
be so heartless? - lshu.

352
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:05,417
Ishita, I lied to you.
- Lie.

353
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:08,667
My brother is not like
how I described him to you.

354
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:10,792
He loves me a lot.

355
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:13,126
More than you can imagine.

356
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:16,126
For me, I am always
first and then the rest.

357
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:18,334
Then why did you do all this?

358
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,792
Well...

359
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:25,584
When I saw you,
I wanted to talk to you.

360
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:28,542
After talking to you,
I wanted to be your friend.

361
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,709
You were giving me sympathy as well.

362
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:32,834
So I got carried away.

363
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:33,792
Veer.

364
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:35,292
You're crazy, you know.

365
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:40,334
What's up, GUYS-

366
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:41,959
This is my friend, Sid...

367
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:43,042
...and that's his girlfriend...Jenny.

368
00:19:43,126 --> 00:19:44,084
Hi.

369
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:46,459
It's Jenny's birthday today.
- Oh...happy birthday.

370
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:47,376
Thank you.

371
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:49,709
Ishita, I am sure you're
getting bored at home alone.

372
00:19:49,876 --> 00:19:51,001
There must be a problem
with the cable as well...

373
00:19:51,126 --> 00:19:52,334
...and the internet speed's
must be slow too.

374
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:53,126
Right?
- What?

375
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:55,876
What he really means to say
is...why don't you join us for dinner?

376
00:19:56,084 --> 00:19:58,042
Now, at this hour...
- And anyway.

377
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,417
You should never say
no to the birthday girl.

378
00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:00,709
Yeah!
- Come on.

379
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,501
Come on, lshita. It'll be fun.

380
00:20:02,626 --> 00:20:04,459
Please come.
Come on.

381
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:05,876
Come on, lshita.

382
00:20:06,376 --> 00:20:08,126
Okay, fine.
I'll just change and come.

383
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,209
I won't sell your drugs here.

384
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:15,042
Youngsters come here to have fun.

385
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:17,042
And I won't destroy their lives...

386
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:19,126
...by selling them your drugs.

387
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:21,542
We work for King.

388
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:22,959
King. Get that.

389
00:20:23,126 --> 00:20:24,167
Keep the stuff...and sell it.

390
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:25,584
You have to sell it!

391
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,792
Excuse me...this is not the way.

392
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:29,001
Let uncle go.

393
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:29,834
Don't interfere...

394
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:31,501
Uncle Joe, you have to sell the stuff..
- Look here.

395
00:20:31,626 --> 00:20:34,417
Let uncle go...or else
I'm calling the Police.

396
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:41,126
Oh my, God...you just murdered Her incoming
outgoing international communication device.

397
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:42,917
What?
- Mobile!

398
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,584
Why did you break her mobile?

399
00:20:44,751 --> 00:20:47,042
I just broke it.
Are you hurt?

400
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:48,292
Are you her boyfriend?

401
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:50,834
He's not my boyfriend... - Whether I am
or not, that's our personal matter.

402
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,834
We'll sort that out later. lshu

403
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,834
Uncle Joe...what's the matter here?

404
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:56,126
They are King's men.

405
00:20:56,251 --> 00:20:57,292
And they are telling me to sell drugs.

406
00:20:57,459 --> 00:20:58,209
Drugs!

407
00:20:58,334 --> 00:21:00,542
Get lost. Come on.
- Leave!

408
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:20,001
Hey Hero...you don't
know what you've done today?

409
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,042
You just beat up King's men.

410
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:24,209
King isn't going to spare you.
- Get lost.

411
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:44,459
What happened?

412
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:46,126
Beat him.

413
00:22:50,084 --> 00:22:50,792
Die!

414
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:54,376
What's going on?

415
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:55,501
Hey...

416
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:56,542
Veer...

417
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,459
Who is that? Stop!

418
00:22:59,084 --> 00:23:00,042
Stop them

419
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:01,501
Veer.

420
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:02,959
Veer. Are you okay?

421
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:05,042
Are you hurt? Who were they?

422
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:07,167
He's okay now,
you can take him home tomorrow.

423
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:08,917
Veer, take proper rest. Okay.

424
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:10,584
Thanks, doctor.
- Thank you, doctor.

425
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:17,876
Be honest, who were they?
- I don't know.

426
00:23:18,376 --> 00:23:21,917
Siddhu, do you know?
- I... I...

427
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:24,751
I don't know, brother.

428
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:26,167
Hey...

429
00:23:28,042 --> 00:23:30,042
does it pain?
- Not too much.

430
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:31,584
Brave boy.

431
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:34,459
Here you go,
maybe this will make you feel better.

432
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:36,084
Isn't this the phone you wanted?

433
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:38,084
Yes, but how did you know?
- I know everything

434
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,584
Veer, are you okay?
- lshu.

435
00:23:42,584 --> 00:23:45,292
She's a casual friend,
but formal hi-hello.

436
00:23:45,376 --> 00:23:46,542
Isn't it lshu.

437
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:48,626
Hi, brother. Ishita.

438
00:23:48,876 --> 00:23:51,417
She's very strict,
she might get furious.

439
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:54,709
Be clear, Ishita or...lshu.

440
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,751
Whatever your heart likes

441
00:23:56,917 --> 00:23:59,251
It's a good thing you're here,
or I would've come to you instead.

442
00:23:59,376 --> 00:24:01,084
That day your phone broke.

443
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:03,167
This is a gift for you. New phone.

444
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:04,501
I got it for you.

445
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:06,667
But...how can I take this?

446
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:08,751
L...really can't...
- Keep it.

447
00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:11,834
He got it for you with a lot of love...
new phone.

448
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,126
And anyway...you'll need a
phone for your formal 'hi-hello'.

449
00:24:15,376 --> 00:24:16,417
I insist, take it.

450
00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:19,376
Thank you.

451
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,501
Hey... take care.

452
00:24:24,459 --> 00:24:26,376
Take good care of yourself Please

453
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:33,084
See you GUYS-

454
00:24:35,084 --> 00:24:36,501
New phone.

455
00:24:49,376 --> 00:24:51,834
We've found out...
where we can find them!

456
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:32,084
Oh no!

457
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:42,542
Hey...who's there?

458
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,084
Michael, take a look.

459
00:26:47,709 --> 00:26:48,667
Hey, stop.

460
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:21,084
Hey...you don't know
who you just messed with?

461
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:25,001
When King finds out,
he won't spare you.

462
00:27:26,584 --> 00:27:28,751
Then tell him my name.

463
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:36,084
Tell him Kaali had come.

464
00:27:58,417 --> 00:28:00,001
How much did he take ?

465
00:28:00,084 --> 00:28:02,417
He took nothing, just burnt everything.

466
00:28:02,584 --> 00:28:03,917
Burnt it?!

467
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:06,167
Who dared to burn King's stuff...

468
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:08,001
Who?!

469
00:28:08,126 --> 00:28:09,001
I don't know, king.

470
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:10,417
His face was covered.

471
00:28:10,584 --> 00:28:12,709
He just told us his name and left.

472
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:16,209
How long are you going
to take to tell me his name?

473
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:17,417
Kaali.

474
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:18,376
Kaali!

475
00:28:19,251 --> 00:28:21,042
Who is Kaali.

476
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:26,876
King remember the boy from the garage
we beat up. He has a big brother.

477
00:28:27,209 --> 00:28:28,334
It could be him.

478
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:29,709
How can it be him?

479
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:31,834
It can't be him

480
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:34,292
Nothing wrong in checking.

481
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:35,542
Let's go take a look.

482
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:50,751
What is it?

483
00:28:50,876 --> 00:28:51,584
What?

484
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:52,376
Hey...

485
00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:53,667
Veer. Veer!

486
00:28:54,209 --> 00:28:55,167
Veer, what's going on?

487
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:57,251
They are the same guys who beat me up.

488
00:28:57,417 --> 00:28:58,417
Right then...

489
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:00,417
You beat them up, they beat you up.

490
00:29:00,584 --> 00:29:02,709
Scores settled. End of story.
- Now leave.

491
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:07,334
But... - Veer.
You know I don't like violence.

492
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:08,917
Siddhu, take Veer away from here.

493
00:29:09,084 --> 00:29:10,084
And give me that stick.

494
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:12,709
Pintu-Tavde...get back to work, go.

495
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:19,126
I am really sorry.

496
00:29:19,251 --> 00:29:21,667
I am truly embarrassed...
- Very fair.

497
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:25,251
That was amazing justice.
- No, sir...it's your greatness.

498
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:26,876
I am just a small-time car modifier.

499
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:28,792
A connoisseur of cars...

500
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:31,417
Like for your old
classic...re-modified beauty...

501
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:35,584
...El Dorado 1969,
is very close to your heart.

502
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:37,209
Of course it is.

503
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:38,417
And it should be...

504
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:40,876
...because your beloved
father gifted this to you.

505
00:29:41,251 --> 00:29:42,751
You're amazing.

506
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:45,876
Are you a car astrologer?
- No, sir.

507
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:47,709
It's just years of experience.

508
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:50,709
That's fine, but how did
you guess about the father bit?

509
00:29:51,042 --> 00:29:54,001
You're an amazing man.
- No, sir, you're the amazing guy.

510
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,542
You're the man, just look at you.

511
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:56,584
With a hat.

512
00:29:57,042 --> 00:30:00,167
Your...your father
must be so proud of you.

513
00:30:02,584 --> 00:30:03,417
No!

514
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:06,251
He's dead.
- I'm so sorry.

515
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:08,417
Are you okay?
- I am okay.

516
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:11,001
Are you fine?
- I am okay.

517
00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:15,292
Can I tell you something?
- Yes, of course.

518
00:30:16,584 --> 00:30:18,917
I killed my father.

519
00:30:20,042 --> 00:30:22,417
He was no school-teacher,
he was a Don like me.

520
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:26,876
But when I took over the business,
to increase our sales,

521
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:29,001
I started selling drugs.

522
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:30,292
My father said,

523
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:33,584
"NO! its against our principals."

524
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:37,917
Against our principals?!
Our business has no principals!

525
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:40,584
So I killed him.

526
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:44,251
Patrick! Joshua!

527
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:47,292
From now on all my cars
will get modified here.

528
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:49,876
From today Raj will rule on Kings cars.

529
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:52,417
Nice one .. Ain't it?

530
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:56,001
Put that gun away.

531
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:58,209
Put that gun away!

532
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:02,501
Are you scared of guns?

533
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:04,376
Everyone is scared.

534
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:06,501
But you don't need
to be scared anymore.

535
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:07,501
Because I am there...

536
00:31:07,584 --> 00:31:10,001
For any problem, you call on King.

537
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:21,292
If he's Kaali...then I'm not king,
I am the Queen.

538
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:22,876
Let's go.

539
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:29,584
He was pointing a gun at
you and asking... "Are you scared"?

540
00:31:35,042 --> 00:31:36,042
Since we've turned decent...

541
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:43,126
...the entire world has turned rouge!

542
00:32:38,209 --> 00:32:39,001
Kaali...

543
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:33,584
Malik sir, we tried our best.

544
00:33:34,042 --> 00:33:36,709
But couldn't stop Kaali
from taking the gold container.

545
00:33:36,917 --> 00:33:40,042
Raghav...are Randhir's
men getting better...

546
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,376
...or our men getting useless?

547
00:33:43,042 --> 00:33:44,876
There was a time when Randhir and I...

548
00:33:45,042 --> 00:33:47,834
...used to commit small-time
robberies at the docks.

549
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,917
And now he's messing with me.

550
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:57,334
That tone in his voice...is
only because of Kali.

551
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:00,542
Shakti.
- Yeah.

552
00:34:00,626 --> 00:34:02,542
Have you checked the list
for the meeting we called tomorrow?

553
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:03,501
Yes, I did.

554
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,834
You need to Wrap this
and be careful, okay? And ..

555
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:08,376
You'll carry on, I'll join you.

556
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:09,167
And those two,

557
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:11,792
they need to be wrapped
and they are sold so just be careful.

558
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,251
Hi. Excuse me.

559
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,126
Yes.
- I...

560
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:18,001
Yeah, that one.

561
00:34:18,251 --> 00:34:20,376
I am really sorry that
you're so injured because of me.

562
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:21,542
No, no, it's okay.

563
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:23,167
I'll get well within few days.

564
00:34:23,251 --> 00:34:25,334
I'll drop you in my car.

565
00:34:25,459 --> 00:34:27,834
No, no, it's okay,
I'll catch the tram. - No, allow me.

566
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:30,667
I'll drop you till there, please.
- Okay.

567
00:34:31,376 --> 00:34:33,542
I am so sorry.
- Its okay.

568
00:34:35,334 --> 00:34:36,876
By the way,
who were those men after me?

569
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:39,667
What a nice weather?
Do you live in Bulgaria?

570
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:42,334
Actually, my hobby is fishing.
- What?

571
00:34:42,459 --> 00:34:44,292
You're answering my question
with some random answer...

572
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:46,001
...and I am doing the same with you.

573
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,667
Okay, alright.

574
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:49,126
Who were they?

575
00:34:50,042 --> 00:34:51,001
Gangsters.

576
00:34:51,751 --> 00:34:52,751
Gangsters?

577
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:55,334
Actually,
they were from our rival gang.

578
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:56,542
What?

579
00:34:57,042 --> 00:34:59,292
Have you heard about Randhir Bakshi?

580
00:35:00,042 --> 00:35:03,209
That Indian Don...who settled down here?

581
00:35:05,251 --> 00:35:07,417
Yes. I am his son.

582
00:35:08,334 --> 00:35:10,001
What happened? Are you scared?

583
00:35:10,626 --> 00:35:12,667
No...why should I be scared?

584
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:14,834
I didn't harm your
daddy don in anyway...

585
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:16,584
...that you guys will come and kill me.

586
00:35:16,709 --> 00:35:19,417
I mean...l am not scared.

587
00:35:19,626 --> 00:35:21,417
Then why are you walking in
the opposite direction?

588
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:23,417
The trams this way. Come on.

589
00:35:23,709 --> 00:35:24,667
Come...

590
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,126
What's your name?

591
00:35:29,084 --> 00:35:30,292
Meera.
- Nice.

592
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:32,001
Meera Dev Malik.

593
00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:33,667
And yours.

594
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:34,792
Kaali.

595
00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:38,334
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

596
00:35:38,459 --> 00:35:39,917
No, you did something...

597
00:35:40,042 --> 00:35:40,876
What happened?

598
00:35:41,584 --> 00:35:44,042
You look modern,
but your name's Kaali.

599
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:46,167
Oh come on, it's not that old also.

600
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:48,376
Kaali is a good name.
- No of fence, but...

601
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:50,417
...I am sure your daddy
threatens like this...

602
00:35:50,584 --> 00:35:54,709
"Swear on Kaali,
I won't spare you alive."

603
00:35:55,876 --> 00:35:56,667
No?

604
00:35:58,084 --> 00:35:59,292
No?.. no

605
00:36:03,042 --> 00:36:04,084
That's funny.

606
00:36:04,251 --> 00:36:05,334
That's really funny.

607
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:06,709
Come. - That is funny, see.

608
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:08,251
Swear on Kaali.

609
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,917
By the way,
Meera...were you born in Bulgaria?

610
00:36:13,209 --> 00:36:16,042
No...actually papa came here from India.

611
00:36:16,167 --> 00:36:19,126
Artifacts were his hobby.
So he opened an art gallery.

612
00:36:19,334 --> 00:36:21,917
And...even I do street-exhibitions
of my paintings.

613
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:26,209
Yeah, I saw that.
- Ouch...l am so sorry.

614
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:28,876
I'm feeling really guilty
seeing you in this condition.

615
00:36:29,042 --> 00:36:30,376
You're feeling guilty!
- A lot.

616
00:36:30,459 --> 00:36:32,417
Then pay my hospital bills.
- What?

617
00:36:32,542 --> 00:36:35,417
I'm hurt,
I had to buy crutches...and medicines...

618
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:37,584
You know how expensive they are? ,Right?

619
00:36:37,751 --> 00:36:42,126
So you just pay the money,
which will help me. - Okay.

620
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:44,917
No need to draw your gun for
such a small thing? - It's not a gun.

621
00:36:45,084 --> 00:36:47,917
It's my phone.
- Oh... Thank God.

622
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:49,584
Give me your number.

623
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:51,167
My number?

624
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,876
Yes, I mean...I'll call
your number from my number...

625
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:57,501
...and then you'll have
my number on your number.

626
00:36:57,584 --> 00:36:58,917
Oh really..
- Yeah, really?

627
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:03,376
I mean...when you go to the hospital,
they will give you the bill.

628
00:37:03,626 --> 00:37:06,209
So you'll have to call me and tell me.

629
00:37:06,376 --> 00:37:08,584
Or is it No?

630
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:17,834
088743... 3...what?

631
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:48,376
Come on, come on quickly.
- Brother.

632
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:49,792
Give me a five.

633
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:50,834
Yes!

634
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:53,209
What tall you've become.

635
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:54,542
Papa“.

636
00:37:55,042 --> 00:37:57,001
How are you Veer?
- I am fine.

637
00:37:57,167 --> 00:38:00,834
Look at all the gifts we've got for you.

638
00:38:02,876 --> 00:38:05,292
This means I'm not going
home this time either.

639
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:07,376
No one loves me.
- Veer.

640
00:38:07,584 --> 00:38:10,209
And brother,
you don't even remember me.

641
00:38:10,584 --> 00:38:11,834
Veer...why are you including me?

642
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:12,709
Veer!

643
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,042
I'll go handle it.

644
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:15,709
Veer. .. Oye!

645
00:38:20,084 --> 00:38:21,584
Dad's just...

646
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:23,209
What should I say?

647
00:38:23,876 --> 00:38:25,251
You're absolutely right.

648
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:27,667
We only come meet you once in a month.

649
00:38:28,751 --> 00:38:34,042
But... that's a different thing that
without you, every day seems like a month.

650
00:38:34,334 --> 00:38:37,251
And also you're right,
I don't miss you at all.

651
00:38:38,709 --> 00:38:43,876
But... that's a different thing that
that we only miss someone we can forget.

652
00:38:44,334 --> 00:38:47,917
And you're absolutely right,
we don't take you home...

653
00:38:48,917 --> 00:38:52,542
But... then it's a different thing that,
we're making a new home...

654
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:56,292
...which will have a
huge room for little Veer.

655
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:00,334
Where You, me and Dad will
live in it together.

656
00:39:00,584 --> 00:39:02,001
Really, brother?

657
00:39:03,042 --> 00:39:04,001
I love you.

658
00:39:06,584 --> 00:39:07,417
Bye.

659
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:11,792
What are you thinking, Dad?

660
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:18,584
Just that we can't let Veer
stay with us because of this enmity.

661
00:39:18,751 --> 00:39:21,542
There's always threat to life...

662
00:39:22,584 --> 00:39:24,417
...and he's only a small kid.

663
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:26,334
But Kaali, if it wasn't for you...

664
00:39:26,584 --> 00:39:28,001
...I don't know how I
could've handled all this.

665
00:39:28,084 --> 00:39:29,209
No, Dad.

666
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:31,209
Can I say something to you in a honesty?

667
00:39:31,376 --> 00:39:36,751
Sometimes I wonder...
if I've been unfair to you.

668
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,917
You see...I'm educating Veer here.

669
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:42,917
But...l always kept you close to me.

670
00:39:43,084 --> 00:39:45,042
Burdened you with the
responsibility of my work.

671
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:47,584
And always put your life in danger.

672
00:39:48,376 --> 00:39:50,542
I mean...just because
you're not my blood...

673
00:39:50,709 --> 00:39:54,209
...I hope you don't misunderstand me.

674
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:55,584
No, dad.

675
00:39:56,542 --> 00:39:57,584
Not at all.

676
00:39:58,709 --> 00:39:59,792
I had no one.

677
00:40:01,251 --> 00:40:02,834
You picked me up from the streets.

678
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:05,459
You want to know the truth, Dad.

679
00:40:06,292 --> 00:40:07,667
Even you don't know this.

680
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:09,792
But you love me more than Veer.

681
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:11,459
Really!

682
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:15,084
Promise me, Kaali...

683
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:19,792
...Veer should never know that
you two aren't blood brothers.

684
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,292
He'll never find out.

685
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:27,626
But promise me...
you'll never discuss blood ties again.

686
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:32,792
Careful.
- Bye, Kaali.

687
00:40:33,126 --> 00:40:34,292
I'll see you, dad.

688
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:40,959
Hello, Meera.

689
00:40:41,459 --> 00:40:45,251
Actually,
Kaali, I called you here because...

690
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:47,667
...there are some guys
who've been bothering me.

691
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:48,876
Good good.

692
00:40:49,126 --> 00:40:50,001
Kaali.?

693
00:40:50,417 --> 00:40:51,292
Kaali.!

694
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:54,501
Are you listening?
- Yes, I am all ears.

695
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:57,126
Some guys have been troubling me.

696
00:40:57,251 --> 00:40:58,251
They bother me.

697
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:02,626
And...l am the only Indian
Sketch artist in this area.

698
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:05,917
So...they also pass racist comments.
- Really?

699
00:41:06,042 --> 00:41:07,126
Yes.

700
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:09,959
Just tell me where I can find them.

701
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:12,126
Hey, Indian girl.

702
00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:14,292
Did you sketch that one?

703
00:41:14,626 --> 00:41:16,251
You wanna make a portrait of me.

704
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:18,626
I'll give you a kiss in return.

705
00:41:18,834 --> 00:41:20,667
Come on, don't be shy.

706
00:41:24,126 --> 00:41:25,459
What is your problem?

707
00:41:25,792 --> 00:41:27,376
Get the hell out of here.

708
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:43,584
What's wrong?
Where are you going?

709
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,209
What happened to
all that attitude? Yeah!

710
00:41:46,459 --> 00:41:48,084
Nothing to say? Huh!

711
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:50,209
And you...you wanted to kiss me, right.

712
00:41:50,334 --> 00:41:51,584
Go ahead.

713
00:41:53,792 --> 00:41:54,459
No.

714
00:41:55,001 --> 00:41:55,626
No?

715
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:57,292
Who the man now?

716
00:41:57,459 --> 00:41:58,626
Me the man.

717
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:01,917
Yeah...and you want to see
how the Indians do it? Huh?

718
00:42:02,459 --> 00:42:03,667
Touch me.

719
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:05,459
Touch me. Just touch me.

720
00:42:05,626 --> 00:42:07,626
Touch me now.
Just touch me.

721
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:09,459
Touch me...What?

722
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:10,667
They are gone.

723
00:42:12,209 --> 00:42:14,084
They had to.

724
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:16,251
Come on.
- Okay.

725
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,792
I taught them a good lesson.
- Yeah, wow!

726
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:20,626
Martina, just wrap up please.
- Bye Martina.

727
00:42:20,792 --> 00:42:22,876
And thanks to you too.
- No, no What did I do?

728
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:25,292
Meera, you were saying
about those hospital bills.

729
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,459
If you give them to me,
I'll pay for them.

730
00:42:26,626 --> 00:42:28,417
No...don't worry about it.

731
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:31,209
Today is your lucky day.
- Really, why?

732
00:42:31,417 --> 00:42:32,792
You helped me out today.

733
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:35,126
So scores settled.

734
00:42:35,334 --> 00:42:37,126
Wow! You're so fair.

735
00:42:37,334 --> 00:42:39,251
I must admit, Meera.
- You must. - I agree.

736
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:41,126
Take today for instance,
I had to interfere after all.

737
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,626
Yeah, the way you interfered...

738
00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:44,459
"Me the man." Me the man.
Very impressive.

739
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:46,584
It's important to
make them fear you. Yeah.

740
00:42:46,792 --> 00:42:49,084
If only they had stayed a minute more,
I would've...

741
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,376
No, no, no, Meera. Forsake your anger.

742
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:52,876
You don't get it, Kaali.

743
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:55,626
You have to adapt to the worldly ways.

744
00:42:55,792 --> 00:42:57,584
There's no point
in living like coward.

745
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:59,501
Cowards are the ones who...

746
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:04,209
Oh my, God! Oh my, God!

747
00:43:08,042 --> 00:43:11,459
Don't move, Meera. Freeze.
- Why?

748
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:14,251
If you move,
he'll feel threatened and bite you.

749
00:43:14,334 --> 00:43:16,292
Looks like a wolf.
But don't be scared.

750
00:43:16,459 --> 00:43:18,417
Just be still. Breathe with me.
Breathe in.

751
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:20,876
Yeah. Breathe with me.

752
00:43:21,042 --> 00:43:22,667
Bad doggie. Good Meera. Breathe in.

753
00:43:22,792 --> 00:43:24,959
Breathe out.
Keep breathing. Nice.

754
00:43:27,334 --> 00:43:29,084
Good Meera.

755
00:43:30,459 --> 00:43:32,667
Is he coming back?
- Who?

756
00:43:35,126 --> 00:43:37,084
I think you scared the dog away too.

757
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:38,209
Just“

758
00:43:38,501 --> 00:43:40,626
Meera, I wanted to know...

759
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:42,959
...can you have lunch with me today?

760
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:45,417
I've to visit dad's art gallery today.
- No problem.

761
00:43:45,626 --> 00:43:46,917
Dinner tomorrow?

762
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:49,376
Tomorrow...is mom and dad's anniversary.

763
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:50,501
Oh darn.

764
00:43:50,667 --> 00:43:52,584
I mean good. Congratulations.

765
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:54,084
Breakfast day after...
- Well, day after...

766
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:58,126
Don't say no.
All I need is five minutes.

767
00:43:58,792 --> 00:44:00,626
Five minutes?
- Only five.

768
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:02,292
Okay, done.

769
00:44:03,459 --> 00:44:04,667
Give me five!

770
00:44:50,626 --> 00:44:51,959
Hi.
- Hi.

771
00:44:52,626 --> 00:44:54,584
I thought you wouldn't come.

772
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:57,751
Thank you...thank you
so much that you came.

773
00:44:58,167 --> 00:45:00,751
So...
- So we've a date.

774
00:45:01,001 --> 00:45:03,584
You know we have only five minutes.
- Yeah, I know.

775
00:45:03,792 --> 00:45:04,751
And your time starts now.

776
00:45:04,834 --> 00:45:06,959
Okay, okay.
You're being really strict. Wait.

777
00:45:08,626 --> 00:45:10,209
Come quickly. Come quickly.

778
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:12,667
Your ride, ma'am.
- This?

779
00:45:12,792 --> 00:45:15,751
Yeah...it's a bit far.
Yeah, don't ask questions. Hurry up.

780
00:45:16,001 --> 00:45:17,376
Thank you very much Robert,

781
00:45:17,501 --> 00:45:18,001
<i>Okay boss.</i>

782
00:45:18,126 --> 00:45:19,209

783
00:45:19,334 --> 00:45:21,126
Restaurant?
- Yeah. It's a big date.

784
00:45:21,292 --> 00:45:22,792
We'll start with food.

785
00:45:22,959 --> 00:45:25,792
You do know we've only five minutes.
- Yeah, I know. I heard it.

786
00:45:26,292 --> 00:45:27,084
Tell me something, Meera.

787
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:30,126
You told me about your dad
and also how special he's for you.

788
00:45:30,459 --> 00:45:33,209
Is there anyone else in
your life who's just as special?

789
00:45:33,292 --> 00:45:35,667
Are you trying to find out?
- I've found out.

790
00:45:35,792 --> 00:45:37,959
You wouldn't have come on
this date if there was someone special.

791
00:45:38,126 --> 00:45:40,959
And here we are. Let's go.

792
00:45:41,292 --> 00:45:42,876
Allow me, ma'am.
- Okay.

793
00:45:42,959 --> 00:45:44,834
And thank you very much, Robert.
- Welcome, boss.

794
00:45:44,959 --> 00:45:45,792
Alright.

795
00:45:45,959 --> 00:45:48,001
Meera, this is my favorite restaurant.

796
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:50,501
And this is the first
time I've brought someone here.

797
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:51,626
Please take a seat.

798
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,209
Hi, boys.
- Hello.

799
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:54,459
You guys.

800
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,501
Job change?
- They're multi-talented.

801
00:45:56,792 --> 00:45:58,626
Okay.
- So, what would you like to eat?

802
00:45:58,792 --> 00:46:02,792
Arabian. Chinese.
French. Italian. English... - Chinese.

803
00:46:02,959 --> 00:46:03,667
Chinese it is.

804
00:46:04,292 --> 00:46:06,584
Chinese.
- Enjoy your meal.

805
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:08,126
Thank you.
- Thank you

806
00:46:08,792 --> 00:46:09,542
Meera.
- Yeah.

807
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:14,209
Did you make all those paintings?
- Yeah, you like them?

808
00:46:14,459 --> 00:46:15,959
Love them,
I think they were beautiful.

809
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:16,792
Aaawww

810
00:46:16,959 --> 00:46:18,542
Actually, they were so beautiful...

811
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:21,084
...that you can't take
your eyes off them.

812
00:46:22,584 --> 00:46:25,459
I don't think you're talking
about paintings anymore.

813
00:46:26,376 --> 00:46:27,417
Kaali.

814
00:46:27,709 --> 00:46:28,709
Kaali!

815
00:46:28,917 --> 00:46:30,042
Bill. You're Right.

816
00:46:30,209 --> 00:46:31,542
Only four minutes left. Get the bill.

817
00:46:31,709 --> 00:46:32,542
Your bill

818
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:34,042
Shall I pay this bill just like
I offered to pay the hospital bill?

819
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:35,876
No, no, I'll pay it.
Will you take a cheque?

820
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,876
No cheque, only cash.

821
00:46:38,001 --> 00:46:39,542
Here it is.
And don't waste time, quickly.

822
00:46:39,709 --> 00:46:40,417
Welcome.

823
00:46:40,542 --> 00:46:42,209
You've given me only five minutes.
Come on.

824
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:44,542
The meal was really nice,
but what about dessert?

825
00:46:44,709 --> 00:46:46,751
Dessert?
- Yeah, I want ice-cream.

826
00:46:46,959 --> 00:46:48,459
I want ice-cream.
- Okay, okay.

827
00:46:48,584 --> 00:46:50,251
Ice-cream.

828
00:46:51,584 --> 00:46:52,459
Fast.

829
00:46:52,626 --> 00:46:53,542
Oh my, God.

830
00:46:53,709 --> 00:46:55,376
We don't have much time, Robert.
Let's go quickly.

831
00:46:55,459 --> 00:46:57,876
Okay boss, okay.
- To my ice-cream parlor. Okay

832
00:46:58,959 --> 00:47:00,709
Your...Your ice-cream parlor.
- It's my fathers.

833
00:47:01,959 --> 00:47:03,917
Thank God...there's no traffic.

834
00:47:04,209 --> 00:47:05,376
Otherwise we would've
been stuck for good.

835
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:06,709
We're here, boss.
- We are here!

836
00:47:06,876 --> 00:47:09,042
Oh lovely, We're here.
Come quickly.

837
00:47:09,209 --> 00:47:10,334
Come into my ice-cream parlor...

838
00:47:10,459 --> 00:47:12,376
...said the spider to the fly.

839
00:47:12,459 --> 00:47:13,251
Here we are.

840
00:47:13,376 --> 00:47:16,376
Job change again?
- He's multi-talented as well.

841
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:17,709
So what flavor would you like to have?

842
00:47:17,792 --> 00:47:20,209
Vanilla. Butter-scotch. Strawberry.

843
00:47:20,417 --> 00:47:22,709
Belgium-chocolate chip.
- Who?

844
00:47:23,459 --> 00:47:26,417

845
00:47:28,042 --> 00:47:28,709
Thank God!

846
00:47:28,876 --> 00:47:31,459
Although we came this far,
but you got your flavor.

847
00:47:31,709 --> 00:47:32,876
Thank you.
- Cheers.

848
00:47:33,126 --> 00:47:34,376
Thank you.

849
00:47:34,709 --> 00:47:36,709
Oh, wow!

850
00:47:37,584 --> 00:47:39,084
Belgium-chocolate...nice.

851
00:47:40,209 --> 00:47:41,334
I am loving it.

852
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:43,084
Actually Kaali, seeing you like this...

853
00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:45,626
...it's hard to believe
you do such a dangerous job.

854
00:47:45,792 --> 00:47:48,042
I know, I'm a pretty boy.

855
00:47:48,709 --> 00:47:49,917
Aren't you scared?

856
00:47:51,584 --> 00:47:54,626
I had no weakness before,
so I had no fear.

857
00:47:55,376 --> 00:47:57,334
But now...l don't know.

858
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:02,376
So...any other surprises?
- Of course.

859
00:48:02,584 --> 00:48:03,459
It's not over yet.

860
00:48:03,584 --> 00:48:05,626
Here you are. Thank you.

861
00:48:51,001 --> 00:48:52,376
Flowers for my lady.

862
00:48:54,959 --> 00:48:57,917
Thank you, they're beautiful.
- It's alright.

863
00:49:00,084 --> 00:49:02,751
Anything else?
- No!

864
00:49:03,501 --> 00:49:07,876
You gave me only five minutes,
so...date's over.

865
00:49:08,917 --> 00:49:10,042
Damn!

866
00:49:10,709 --> 00:49:15,334
So I think you like me.
- Of course I like you.

867
00:49:15,501 --> 00:49:18,542
I paid all the bills, in cash.
I must like you.

868
00:49:20,126 --> 00:49:21,334
That's true.

869
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,584
So let's meet tomorrow?

870
00:49:24,876 --> 00:49:26,417
I've an important job tomorrow.

871
00:49:26,626 --> 00:49:28,251
We can meet day after. Please.

872
00:49:28,709 --> 00:49:33,542
But...it's my birthday tomorrow.
- I am so sorry, I didn't know.

873
00:49:33,709 --> 00:49:34,542
But..

874
00:49:34,751 --> 00:49:36,626
If you don't come,
I won't celebrate my birthday.

875
00:49:36,709 --> 00:49:40,834
You see, Meera...I've to take
a consignment to Romania tomorrow.

876
00:49:40,959 --> 00:49:42,251
Dad has spoken to the border police.

877
00:49:42,417 --> 00:49:43,542
Everything's been set.

878
00:49:43,709 --> 00:49:46,917
And we must deliver the
consignment to our buyers tomorrow.

879
00:49:47,042 --> 00:49:48,709
Please.
- Then I'll come along too.

880
00:49:48,876 --> 00:49:50,209
We'll celebrate my
birthday on the border.

881
00:49:50,376 --> 00:49:52,376
Good idea.
- No! Bad idea.

882
00:49:52,542 --> 00:49:54,626
Our rival Malik had his eyes...

883
00:49:54,751 --> 00:49:56,709
...on the gold consignment
I'm talking about.

884
00:49:57,042 --> 00:49:59,626
You can say that I have snatched
this gold away from him.

885
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:02,626
And you don't know
Malik...he's a dangerous man.

886
00:50:02,751 --> 00:50:04,334
Anything is possible. Over there

887
00:50:04,917 --> 00:50:07,042
You don't know how
dangerous it is out there.

888
00:50:07,251 --> 00:50:08,334
Really.

889
00:50:08,459 --> 00:50:10,626
You're not letting me come,
nor are you coming over.

890
00:50:10,709 --> 00:50:11,876
This is not done.

891
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:15,626
I won't celebrate my birthday
without you, and that's it.

892
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:22,876
Okay, then...I'll finish
my job tomorrow at any condition...

893
00:50:23,001 --> 00:50:24,626
...and be back by tomorrow evening.

894
00:50:25,251 --> 00:50:26,376
To you.

895
00:50:27,251 --> 00:50:28,709
Sure?
- Sure.

896
00:50:32,417 --> 00:50:35,251
Promise.
- Okay, yes.

897
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:38,209
Promise!

898
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:47,709
Kaali...we'll definitely meet tomorrow.

899
00:50:56,501 --> 00:50:57,459
Bye.

900
00:51:06,709 --> 00:51:11,876
"Never say goodbye."

901
00:51:12,917 --> 00:51:18,042
"Always be mine,
never say goodbye."

902
00:51:54,626 --> 00:51:55,959
Someone is following us.

903
00:51:56,501 --> 00:51:57,542
Keep moving.

904
00:55:17,876 --> 00:55:18,626
Hi.

905
00:55:19,376 --> 00:55:20,376
What happened?

906
00:55:20,709 --> 00:55:21,959
You look shocked...

907
00:55:22,376 --> 00:55:24,334
...like your entire
world turned upside-down.

908
00:55:27,501 --> 00:55:31,417
Didn't I say...we'll
definitely meet today?

909
00:55:32,376 --> 00:55:34,084
And what did you say?

910
00:55:34,417 --> 00:55:37,376
"Don't come...it's dangerous."

911
00:55:41,084 --> 00:55:44,626
Actually...the danger
you were talking about...

912
00:55:45,126 --> 00:55:48,084
That danger is me.

913
00:55:50,709 --> 00:55:51,709
You didn't get it.

914
00:55:51,876 --> 00:55:53,751
Try to remember, Kaali.

915
00:55:54,542 --> 00:55:57,042
What did I tell you my full name was?

916
00:55:57,209 --> 00:55:59,959
Meera...Dev...Malik!

917
00:56:02,751 --> 00:56:03,959
Malik!

918
00:56:05,584 --> 00:56:07,042
My dad!

919
00:56:07,626 --> 00:56:11,917
"The tone in his voice...
is because of Kaali."

920
00:56:12,459 --> 00:56:14,084
And you know the best part...

921
00:56:14,459 --> 00:56:20,167
...it's my birthday, but...
I'll gift this gold to my dad.

922
00:56:22,459 --> 00:56:24,709
Because...I'm one of
those big-hearted types.

923
00:56:25,126 --> 00:56:27,042
That's why I planned all this.

924
00:56:27,209 --> 00:56:30,459
What did you think?
You rammed me with your car?

925
00:56:30,709 --> 00:56:33,459
No...l came in front myself.

926
00:56:33,709 --> 00:56:35,376
So that my men could kill you.

927
00:56:39,376 --> 00:56:40,876
But they missed.

928
00:56:43,042 --> 00:56:45,209
And the things I had to do after that...

929
00:56:45,376 --> 00:56:47,626
...to get the gold's
information from you.

930
00:56:47,917 --> 00:56:51,542
Pretended to be cripple...
I made my men pose as my enemies...

931
00:56:52,584 --> 00:56:55,167
And I even went on
that stupid date with you.

932
00:56:55,251 --> 00:56:56,209
God!

933
00:56:58,709 --> 00:57:01,917
By the way...how was my acting?

934
00:57:03,292 --> 00:57:05,042
World-class, right?

935
00:57:07,251 --> 00:57:08,084
No!

936
00:57:25,959 --> 00:57:27,542
I spare you...

937
00:57:29,126 --> 00:57:30,959
It's my birthday.

938
00:58:49,209 --> 00:58:51,959
I won't spare that Malik now.
- No, dad.

939
00:58:52,417 --> 00:58:53,626
You won't do anything.

940
00:58:53,876 --> 00:58:55,042
I'm the one who's been betrayed...

941
00:58:55,209 --> 00:58:56,542
...so I'll do what needs to be done.
- But...

942
00:58:56,709 --> 00:58:58,042
Please, Dad.

943
00:59:00,209 --> 00:59:01,751
I want to meet Meera once.

944
00:59:05,376 --> 00:59:07,251
Hello.
- Stop the car, Meera.

945
00:59:16,417 --> 00:59:18,209
Meera, stop the car.

946
00:59:19,084 --> 00:59:20,084
Stop the car, Meera.

947
01:00:36,917 --> 01:00:38,084
Don't be scared.

948
01:00:39,209 --> 01:00:40,251
I won't let go.

949
01:00:42,209 --> 01:00:44,209
I have loved you with all my heart...

950
01:00:45,042 --> 01:00:47,251
...and didn't use my brains,
like you did.

951
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:14,209
Meera... after today don't ever
show me your face again.

952
01:01:16,001 --> 01:01:17,542
I will kill you.

953
01:01:43,459 --> 01:01:46,251
"Goodbye. ."

954
01:02:25,792 --> 01:02:26,751
I am sorry.

955
01:02:27,751 --> 01:02:30,459
I've been unfair to you.

956
01:02:32,209 --> 01:02:35,709
Whereas to you...have only loved.

957
01:02:36,251 --> 01:02:39,959
The thing you had faith on...was love.

958
01:02:41,209 --> 01:02:42,876
But the only difference was...

959
01:02:44,042 --> 01:02:45,959
...that you realized it first.'

960
01:02:48,376 --> 01:02:50,209
And I have realized it now.

961
01:02:55,251 --> 01:02:57,584
You might not even believe me...

962
01:02:58,001 --> 01:02:59,751
...but I have to say this.

963
01:03:03,959 --> 01:03:05,167
I love you!

964
01:03:17,292 --> 01:03:18,167
Kaali!

965
01:03:19,209 --> 01:03:20,584
Kaali, Listen to me

966
01:03:20,792 --> 01:03:23,876
Kaali, I won't leave until
you don't believe me.

967
01:03:25,209 --> 01:03:26,876
Please, Kaali.

968
01:03:27,876 --> 01:03:29,876
Just believe me.

969
01:03:30,917 --> 01:03:31,709
Please.

970
01:03:34,167 --> 01:03:34,876
Kaali...

971
01:03:45,876 --> 01:03:46,876
Kaali!

972
01:04:29,542 --> 01:04:31,376
Would you like some dinner?

973
01:04:32,376 --> 01:04:34,584
I see...you must be on a diet.

974
01:04:36,209 --> 01:04:39,084
It's raining,
how about I get you some...

975
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,084
Coffee! Coffee!

976
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,876
It's okay...

977
01:05:00,751 --> 01:05:03,501
What do you want to prove?
- That I love you.

978
01:05:03,751 --> 01:05:05,376
Why should I believe you?

979
01:05:05,584 --> 01:05:09,542
You believed me when
I didn't love you.

980
01:05:11,001 --> 01:05:14,959
And now that I do,
you don't believe me.

981
01:05:16,709 --> 01:05:18,084
What's the problem?

982
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:20,209
I don't want to be betrayed again.

983
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:22,709
You can shoot me if I do.

984
01:05:23,001 --> 01:05:26,459
Firing bullets...
using guns.. taking lives.

985
01:05:28,751 --> 01:05:31,376
Isn't there anything else you can do?

986
01:05:32,709 --> 01:05:33,876
I don't.

987
01:05:34,917 --> 01:05:36,709
But you do.

988
01:05:39,417 --> 01:05:40,917
You Teach me.

989
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:43,251
Please!

990
01:06:18,334 --> 01:06:20,959
"Permeating through the sunlight."

991
01:06:21,126 --> 01:06:23,584
"Slipping through the shades."

992
01:06:23,876 --> 01:06:26,417
"When we met..."

993
01:06:26,626 --> 01:06:29,167
"...the moment froze."

994
01:06:29,334 --> 01:06:31,792
"The sky melted."

995
01:06:32,001 --> 01:06:34,542
"Converged into a glass."

996
01:06:34,792 --> 01:06:39,292
"And froze into the
shape of your face."

997
01:06:39,417 --> 01:06:41,917
"I've renounced the world...

998
01:06:42,001 --> 01:06:44,417
"...to be with you."

999
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:49,542
"Just one prayer that
comes from my heart."

1000
01:06:50,167 --> 01:06:54,959
"Color me saffron"

1001
01:06:55,667 --> 01:07:00,626
"A prayer straight
from the beloved's heart."

1002
01:07:01,001 --> 01:07:05,792
"Color me saffron"

1003
01:07:06,626 --> 01:07:11,584
"A prayer straight from the heart."

1004
01:07:12,001 --> 01:07:16,626
"Color me saffron"

1005
01:07:37,709 --> 01:07:40,417
"Starts with you..."

1006
01:07:40,792 --> 01:07:43,167
"...and ends on you."

1007
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:48,751
"This saga is eternal."

1008
01:07:49,001 --> 01:07:51,334
"I am the journey..."

1009
01:07:51,584 --> 01:07:54,001
"...and you're the destination."

1010
01:07:54,334 --> 01:07:56,751
"Every path..."

1011
01:07:57,001 --> 01:08:00,417
"...leads only to you."

1012
01:08:00,667 --> 01:08:02,917
"As my heart..."

1013
01:08:03,334 --> 01:08:05,584
"...carefully united with yours."

1014
01:08:06,001 --> 01:08:10,501
"it alleviated the fog of my pain."

1015
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:12,917
"I've renounced the world..."

1016
01:08:13,459 --> 01:08:15,584
"..to be with you."

1017
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:20,959
"Just one prayer that
comes from my heart."

1018
01:08:21,626 --> 01:08:25,376
"Color me saffron"

1019
01:08:27,001 --> 01:08:31,917
"A prayer straight
from the beloved's heart."

1020
01:08:32,417 --> 01:08:37,292
"Color me saffron"

1021
01:08:52,501 --> 01:08:55,334
"My world..."

1022
01:08:55,792 --> 01:08:58,126
"...was completely lonely."

1023
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:03,667
"But since the day you arrived..."

1024
01:09:04,001 --> 01:09:14,501
"Your arrival, gave life...
to my soulless body."

1025
01:09:15,667 --> 01:09:20,584
"All the relations in the world..."

1026
01:09:21,126 --> 01:09:25,459
"...seem meaningless."

1027
01:09:25,709 --> 01:09:27,917
"My bond with you has deepened "

1028
01:09:28,501 --> 01:09:30,584
"I've renounced the world...
to be with you."

1029
01:09:31,126 --> 01:09:36,084
"Just one prayer that
comes from my heart."

1030
01:09:36,584 --> 01:09:41,501
"Color me saffron"

1031
01:09:42,001 --> 01:09:47,001
"A prayer straight
from the beloved's heart."

1032
01:09:47,459 --> 01:09:51,959
"Color me saffron"

1033
01:09:52,834 --> 01:09:57,584
"A prayer straight from the heart."

1034
01:09:58,501 --> 01:10:02,667
"Color me saffron"

1035
01:10:27,334 --> 01:10:28,417
Kaali.

1036
01:10:30,876 --> 01:10:33,834
We should tell our families about us.

1037
01:10:35,084 --> 01:10:38,834
I don't want them to
find out from somewhere else.

1038
01:10:39,251 --> 01:10:40,459
It won't be nice.

1039
01:10:41,584 --> 01:10:43,084
Yeah, you're right.

1040
01:10:44,876 --> 01:10:47,084
You know, I can convince my dad.

1041
01:10:47,334 --> 01:10:48,876
But what about your dad?

1042
01:10:49,334 --> 01:10:50,834
I hope he doesn't think that...

1043
01:10:51,042 --> 01:10:54,542
...Me and my dad have cooked
up some plan to deceive him.

1044
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:56,376
I will explain it to him.

1045
01:10:57,042 --> 01:11:00,917
And anyway, he doesn't hate you
as much as he loves me.

1046
01:11:02,751 --> 01:11:04,584
Yeah...l am sure.

1047
01:11:06,042 --> 01:11:11,292
But tell me one thing ...what if Me
and my dad have really made a plan?

1048
01:11:17,084 --> 01:11:18,709
So Then I will shoot you!

1049
01:11:43,709 --> 01:11:45,709
Another robbery?
- Yeah.

1050
01:11:46,042 --> 01:11:48,501
Imported headlights are gone too.
- Yeah.

1051
01:11:48,709 --> 01:11:50,667
I fell asleep again?
- Yes.

1052
01:11:51,542 --> 01:11:53,292
You're so consistent, Veer.

1053
01:11:53,417 --> 01:11:55,626
This car needs to be
delivered in the evening...

1054
01:11:55,834 --> 01:11:57,167
...but we don't have headlights.

1055
01:11:57,459 --> 01:11:58,417
I wonder what's going to happen.

1056
01:11:59,001 --> 01:12:00,626
Don't worry, brother.

1057
01:12:01,251 --> 01:12:02,001
This is my fault.

1058
01:12:02,959 --> 01:12:04,792
I'll think of something.
Leave it to me.

1059
01:12:06,292 --> 01:12:07,334
Anwar, what are you doing?

1060
01:12:07,501 --> 01:12:08,667
Raj, he's is the thief.

1061
01:12:08,834 --> 01:12:10,417
Look at what he was stealing
and going with.

1062
01:12:10,584 --> 01:12:12,501
Mani, back to your old tricks again.

1063
01:12:12,834 --> 01:12:13,542
It's a cake.

1064
01:12:13,751 --> 01:12:15,292
That's what I've been trying
to tell you, that it's a cake!

1065
01:12:15,417 --> 01:12:16,751
Mani, you're stealing cakes now?

1066
01:12:16,876 --> 01:12:19,042
No, Raj, it's my happy birthday.

1067
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:21,834
I bought this cake from his cafe.
Look, I even have the bill.

1068
01:12:22,042 --> 01:12:24,084
I thought I'll sit
with my brother Raj...

1069
01:12:24,251 --> 01:12:26,126
...and we'll eat this cake together.

1070
01:12:26,334 --> 01:12:28,834
Just because a man is dark skinned
you will trash him so hard.

1071
01:12:29,001 --> 01:12:29,917
Sorry, Mani. Sorry.

1072
01:12:30,042 --> 01:12:31,792
Anwar, how could you
without seeing or thinking...

1073
01:12:31,917 --> 01:12:33,542
Mani, there's been a
theft in the garage again.

1074
01:12:33,751 --> 01:12:35,251
So there's a bit of confusion.
- I see.

1075
01:12:35,334 --> 01:12:36,501
Sorry.
- No, no not a problem.

1076
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:38,834
Come on... let it go..let's cut it.
- Who?

1077
01:12:39,001 --> 01:12:40,084
Your cake.

1078
01:12:40,459 --> 01:12:41,542
I got scared.

1079
01:12:41,751 --> 01:12:42,667
Anwar, get the candles.

1080
01:12:42,834 --> 01:12:44,251
Don't take it to your heart,
he's a bit emotional.

1081
01:12:44,376 --> 01:12:45,959
So he raised his hand on you.
Anwar

1082
01:12:46,084 --> 01:12:46,917
You too Anwar.

1083
01:12:48,084 --> 01:12:50,917
Hey...why are you sulking?

1084
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:53,501
Mani bhai, I need to arrange
for imported headlights.

1085
01:12:53,667 --> 01:12:54,917
Where do I get them from?

1086
01:12:55,209 --> 01:12:57,417
Imported headlights?
- Yeah.

1087
01:12:57,834 --> 01:12:59,417
Don't worry.

1088
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:02,001
There's only one
man you can get it from.

1089
01:13:02,334 --> 01:13:03,126
Oscar bhai.

1090
01:13:03,251 --> 01:13:07,751
Wow, Mani...you're so lucky...
Like Nokia, Blackberry.

1091
01:13:08,167 --> 01:13:10,459
My no. 1 thief just called.

1092
01:13:10,667 --> 01:13:12,626
He's getting the same
brand projector lamps...

1093
01:13:12,834 --> 01:13:14,292
...like the one you wanted.

1094
01:13:15,417 --> 01:13:17,917
He said he stole it last night.

1095
01:13:18,292 --> 01:13:21,084
Do it fast, son.

1096
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:24,917
See...this speaker and
That music-system...which are sold.

1097
01:13:25,042 --> 01:13:26,626
Look here.

1098
01:13:26,834 --> 01:13:28,667
This is a BMW Steering Wheel.

1099
01:13:30,334 --> 01:13:32,084
All this is his loot, Mani.

1100
01:13:32,334 --> 01:13:35,001
When will my...
I mean, your no.1 thief?

1101
01:13:35,167 --> 01:13:37,251
Wait for 5 minutes.

1102
01:13:37,459 --> 01:13:41,417
He must be on the way...
McDonald Subway. - Okay.

1103
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,084
We'll wait outside.
- Yeah.

1104
01:13:43,251 --> 01:13:46,001
It's the same thief who
robbed our entire garage.

1105
01:13:46,251 --> 01:13:47,751
Let him come...
- Yeah, let him.

1106
01:13:47,876 --> 01:13:50,792
I'll tie a wrist
watch on both his arms.

1107
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:52,251
What will that do?

1108
01:13:52,417 --> 01:13:54,667
Then he'll know his time's up.

1109
01:14:04,751 --> 01:14:05,917
He's got the same headlights.

1110
01:14:12,126 --> 01:14:14,626
Oscar bhai...
- Yeah.

1111
01:14:14,876 --> 01:14:18,626
Here's comes my number one
'Chor' (thief)... Boxer, Labrador.

1112
01:14:18,834 --> 01:14:19,792
Keep it.

1113
01:14:19,917 --> 01:14:23,042
You are my ace of spades...
best in best.

1114
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:25,917
Keep this...30,000 Siddhu.

1115
01:14:26,126 --> 01:14:28,709
Go and squander all
of it on your girlfriend.

1116
01:14:28,917 --> 01:14:30,834
But tell me one thing.

1117
01:14:31,042 --> 01:14:35,584
Just like ATM spins out money,
how do you manage all this?

1118
01:14:35,792 --> 01:14:37,417
Coffee.
- Coffee? Coffee

1119
01:14:38,251 --> 01:14:40,542
Oscar bhai, I've a friend.

1120
01:14:40,792 --> 01:14:42,584
And he trusts me more than required

1121
01:14:42,751 --> 01:14:44,876
I put sleeping pills
in his coffee, and...

1122
01:14:45,376 --> 01:14:46,417
Siddhu...!

1123
01:14:47,417 --> 01:14:50,334
Veer...what are you doing here?

1124
01:14:51,376 --> 01:14:52,917
Veer, listen to me...
Let's sit down and talk.

1125
01:14:53,042 --> 01:14:54,042
Rascal..

1126
01:14:54,376 --> 01:14:56,709
Veer...
- Beat him.

1127
01:14:56,917 --> 01:14:58,959
Why are you running?
Stop!

1128
01:14:59,376 --> 01:15:00,292
Stop thief.

1129
01:15:02,626 --> 01:15:03,501
Don't let him go.

1130
01:15:05,126 --> 01:15:06,292
Veer. Veer.

1131
01:15:06,459 --> 01:15:07,084
Stop!

1132
01:15:08,042 --> 01:15:09,084
Veer...
Veer, listen to me.

1133
01:15:09,251 --> 01:15:10,126
Veer. Veer.

1134
01:15:10,334 --> 01:15:12,542
Hit him.
Hit him. Hit him.

1135
01:15:12,792 --> 01:15:14,709
<i>How dare you touch Rays stuff'?</i>

1136
01:15:14,792 --> 01:15:16,501
How dare you steal at Raj's place?

1137
01:15:16,792 --> 01:15:19,709
I'll cut off your hands.
Veer, enough. Enough!

1138
01:15:19,917 --> 01:15:21,126
Nagpada- Agripada...

1139
01:15:21,334 --> 01:15:23,209
He's down. He's fallen down.

1140
01:15:23,334 --> 01:15:26,459
Veer... Veer, we can discuss
this over a cup of coffee.

1141
01:15:26,626 --> 01:15:27,417
Coffee!

1142
01:15:27,542 --> 01:15:30,417
To hell with your coffee...
- Enough! Enough Veer!

1143
01:15:31,751 --> 01:15:33,501
I took you as a brother not as a friend.

1144
01:15:33,709 --> 01:15:36,001
I would've tolerated it
If anyone else had done this.

1145
01:15:36,126 --> 01:15:37,334
But you did this to me.

1146
01:15:38,792 --> 01:15:39,959
Let's go, Mani.

1147
01:15:40,251 --> 01:15:41,917
What happened Veer?

1148
01:15:43,417 --> 01:15:47,292
I didn't ask you to stop...
then why did you stop?

1149
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:49,126
You must have said 'stop' 50 times.

1150
01:15:49,251 --> 01:15:51,376
I just blurted that out in extempore.

1151
01:15:52,792 --> 01:15:54,584
How can a bus fit in a tempo

1152
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:57,709
Extempore...Mani bhai.
- Was it a big tempo?

1153
01:15:57,792 --> 01:15:59,126
Mani...quiet!

1154
01:16:00,376 --> 01:16:04,917
Veer...you saw what your brother did.

1155
01:16:05,042 --> 01:16:05,834
And how.

1156
01:16:05,917 --> 01:16:08,042
But...you consider me a brother,
don't you?

1157
01:16:08,376 --> 01:16:11,751
You never bothered
to ask why I did it.

1158
01:16:12,126 --> 01:16:13,959
Look at me.

1159
01:16:14,334 --> 01:16:16,001
The same old shirt,
the same old jeans...

1160
01:16:16,126 --> 01:16:19,001
...and the same old
shoes that you gave me.

1161
01:16:19,292 --> 01:16:22,542
I have never spent a penny on myself.

1162
01:16:23,126 --> 01:16:27,126
I have spent everything
on my love...my Jenny.

1163
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:32,209
It wasn't easy to win her heart.

1164
01:16:33,959 --> 01:16:37,959
You rascal...look at your own fate.

1165
01:16:38,542 --> 01:16:40,876
We both grew up in a boy's hostel.

1166
01:16:41,001 --> 01:16:43,001
No sign or symbol of girls

1167
01:16:43,126 --> 01:16:43,959
And when we came out...

1168
01:16:44,084 --> 01:16:45,292
we were surrounded
by a brother or an uncle...

1169
01:16:45,459 --> 01:16:48,251
We spent our entire youth amongst men!

1170
01:16:53,251 --> 01:16:55,209
It's true, Siddhu.

1171
01:16:55,917 --> 01:16:59,542
I went through so much trouble
to cajole that Monica aunty.

1172
01:16:59,626 --> 01:17:00,459
Aunty?

1173
01:17:01,376 --> 01:17:03,126
The neighbor's maid.
- I see.

1174
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:04,501
I was serious about her.

1175
01:17:04,626 --> 01:17:06,209
But before I could tell her...

1176
01:17:06,334 --> 01:17:08,417
...she ran off with
that puncture-repairer.

1177
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:13,334
Life's been so hard on us...
that we never got any girl in our life.

1178
01:17:13,626 --> 01:17:19,292
And see...l can't even
tell lshita...that I love her.

1179
01:17:19,626 --> 01:17:23,459
Veer, why are you crying?
- You're crying too.

1180
01:17:23,626 --> 01:17:25,167
Your brother's still alive.

1181
01:17:25,292 --> 01:17:27,959
I will help you.
- You will.

1182
01:17:28,084 --> 01:17:30,792
Yes...and you'll help me in return.

1183
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:32,501
You won't tell our brothers...

1184
01:17:32,626 --> 01:17:34,292
...that I was the one
who stole all that stuff.

1185
01:17:34,459 --> 01:17:35,251
Rascal...

1186
01:17:35,501 --> 01:17:39,001
Sorry, but you just wait and
watch the ideas I give you now.

1187
01:17:39,126 --> 01:17:40,709
You won't stay bachelor any more.

1188
01:17:40,917 --> 01:17:42,751
In fact, no one will
stay bachelor anymore.

1189
01:17:42,917 --> 01:17:45,501
We'll even find a Mani-ben
for this Mani-bhai.

1190
01:17:45,959 --> 01:17:47,209
Well said.

1191
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:51,251
Even my parents never
thought about me, but you did.

1192
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:55,001
You're not human, you're definitely
some angel. Get yourself checked up.

1193
01:17:55,126 --> 01:17:56,542
I am there.

1194
01:17:56,792 --> 01:17:58,459
Veer, just see what I do now.

1195
01:17:58,584 --> 01:18:00,001
Just wait and watch.

1196
01:18:00,126 --> 01:18:02,417
What are you doing?
- What's this?

1197
01:18:05,584 --> 01:18:07,459
Where's Veer?
Why isn't he here yet?

1198
01:18:07,584 --> 01:18:09,542
Veer? Look!

1199
01:18:14,084 --> 01:18:15,751
He's waiting for you there.

1200
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:17,376
Waiting for me?

1201
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:27,501
Hi.
- Hi.

1202
01:18:27,792 --> 01:18:30,001
Ishita, I could never
muster the courage to say this.

1203
01:18:30,792 --> 01:18:32,834
But on this Christmas Eve...

1204
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,876
...I want to convey his message to you.

1205
01:18:35,126 --> 01:18:36,251
Whose?

1206
01:18:38,751 --> 01:18:39,876
My heart..

1207
01:18:40,917 --> 01:18:41,751
Go ahead.

1208
01:18:41,834 --> 01:18:45,667
Well, normally people celebrate
Christmas with someone special.

1209
01:18:45,917 --> 01:18:48,542
But they are all
dying to go out with me.

1210
01:18:50,626 --> 01:18:52,542
But I will only go...

1211
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:55,042
...with her!

1212
01:18:58,001 --> 01:18:59,209
I've lied to you many times.

1213
01:18:59,584 --> 01:19:02,459
But it's said that we should
speak only the truth on Christmas.

1214
01:19:03,584 --> 01:19:05,834
So the truth is I really...

1215
01:19:09,001 --> 01:19:12,834
I will be with you every
moment...for all my life.

1216
01:19:13,084 --> 01:19:15,709
Even if you look
like this years later.

1217
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:25,584
Brother...please handle it.

1218
01:19:46,917 --> 01:19:47,959
Veer.

1219
01:19:49,626 --> 01:19:51,376
There's something I want to say.

1220
01:19:51,584 --> 01:19:52,876
Tell me

1221
01:19:54,001 --> 01:19:56,959
I think we should tell
our families about us.

1222
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:59,709
What's the hurry, lshu?
- I mean we've just started now.

1223
01:19:59,834 --> 01:20:00,792
Veer...

1224
01:20:00,917 --> 01:20:03,376
I don't want them to
find out from someone else.

1225
01:20:03,584 --> 01:20:05,084
I won't like it.

1226
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:06,459
We should talk to them.

1227
01:20:06,626 --> 01:20:07,459
Yeah.

1228
01:20:07,626 --> 01:20:08,542
What yeah...

1229
01:20:08,626 --> 01:20:10,167
I will talk to my family...

1230
01:20:10,417 --> 01:20:13,376
Will you be able to tell your brother, or...
- lshu.

1231
01:20:13,626 --> 01:20:15,917
We love each other. It's not a crime.

1232
01:20:16,084 --> 01:20:18,709
I'll tell brother on his face...

1233
01:20:23,001 --> 01:20:25,292
It's been 28 minutes...
will you say something?

1234
01:20:25,459 --> 01:20:27,917
All you've been saying
is "I want to say something"...

1235
01:20:28,042 --> 01:20:28,584
What?

1236
01:20:28,792 --> 01:20:31,501
I want to share my
personal feelings with you.

1237
01:20:31,626 --> 01:20:32,542
Yeah.

1238
01:20:32,959 --> 01:20:36,459
I need some time.
- Okay, okay, take your time.

1239
01:20:43,959 --> 01:20:46,167
I want to celebrate my
'Suhagraat' (wedding night).

1240
01:20:47,334 --> 01:20:48,167
With whom?

1241
01:20:49,334 --> 01:20:50,251
Su...

1242
01:20:50,376 --> 01:20:52,834
Subhash... I want to
tell you about Subhash.

1243
01:20:52,959 --> 01:20:55,459
He's bringing the bumper
tomorrow...at the garage.

1244
01:20:55,751 --> 01:20:57,501
You took 29 minutes to say that.

1245
01:20:57,626 --> 01:20:59,917
Don't worry, I'll collect
the bumper from Subhash, okay?

1246
01:21:02,917 --> 01:21:06,334
I want to marry you.

1247
01:21:09,917 --> 01:21:10,959
What...
- No.

1248
01:21:12,042 --> 01:21:13,209
What are you saying?

1249
01:21:15,084 --> 01:21:17,042
I want to kiss you lip-to-lip.

1250
01:21:18,251 --> 01:21:19,292
Are you crazy?

1251
01:21:19,459 --> 01:21:20,334
What's he blabbering.

1252
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:21,751
I'll tell you.

1253
01:21:22,792 --> 01:21:24,834
I knew he couldn't say it.

1254
01:21:25,334 --> 01:21:27,334
Actually, brother...

1255
01:21:28,626 --> 01:21:30,917
...we really love each other.

1256
01:21:31,334 --> 01:21:32,876
Really?
- Yes.

1257
01:21:33,334 --> 01:21:36,876
And I didn't want you to
find this out from someone else.

1258
01:21:38,584 --> 01:21:39,834
I wouldn't like it.

1259
01:21:39,917 --> 01:21:43,542
Raj...Veer isn't fooling
around this time..

1260
01:21:43,792 --> 01:21:46,292
He's found the right girl this time.

1261
01:21:46,459 --> 01:21:47,709
Yes, she's the right call-girl.

1262
01:21:47,792 --> 01:21:48,917
Oh Anwar...

1263
01:21:49,084 --> 01:21:50,876
I am...
- Really sorry.

1264
01:21:51,251 --> 01:21:53,417
Actually I would like
to meet your family.

1265
01:21:53,917 --> 01:21:55,417
Let me know if they're free tomorrow.

1266
01:21:55,501 --> 01:21:56,876
I'll come over.
- Okay.

1267
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:05,626
Sir...madam will come
down in two minutes.

1268
01:22:05,792 --> 01:22:07,334
Would you like some tea or coffee?

1269
01:22:07,542 --> 01:22:09,001
No. This is fine, thank you

1270
01:22:09,126 --> 01:22:10,459
Okay, sir.

1271
01:22:16,042 --> 01:22:17,501
I am sorry,
I think you are...

1272
01:22:54,584 --> 01:22:56,667
After coming to know
that you're Veer's brother...

1273
01:22:56,792 --> 01:22:58,917
...I won't let Ishita meet Veer again.

1274
01:23:00,667 --> 01:23:02,167
You were mistaken, Meera.

1275
01:23:02,251 --> 01:23:03,959
I wanted to tell you the truth.

1276
01:23:04,084 --> 01:23:05,876
But until then...
you were already gone.

1277
01:23:07,126 --> 01:23:10,042
You only broke my trust, Kaali.

1278
01:23:11,126 --> 01:23:13,334
I spared your life
today for lshita's sake.

1279
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:16,001
But if you come back here again,
I will kill you.

1280
01:23:23,792 --> 01:23:25,167
'Dear...
- Yes.'

1281
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:28,001
'Dear...you've managed to convince me.'

1282
01:23:29,084 --> 01:23:33,001
'But...l know your
stubborn father too well.'

1283
01:23:33,167 --> 01:23:35,084
'He will never agree
to this relationship.'

1284
01:23:38,542 --> 01:23:39,501
'I will convince him.'

1285
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:52,292
Fine...

1286
01:23:53,209 --> 01:23:55,292
...I am ready to meet them.

1287
01:23:56,959 --> 01:23:58,584
Thank you so much, dad.

1288
01:23:58,917 --> 01:24:03,501
I can tolerate anything...
but not your sad face.

1289
01:24:04,584 --> 01:24:06,292
Thank you.

1290
01:24:08,417 --> 01:24:10,792
Malik sir, what have you done?

1291
01:24:11,334 --> 01:24:13,959
You're going to bow down before
that Randhir for your daughter's sake.

1292
01:24:14,334 --> 01:24:16,376
You didn't get it, Raghav.

1293
01:24:16,876 --> 01:24:19,626
I can bow my head down
before my enemies for Meera...

1294
01:24:20,001 --> 01:24:22,626
...but I cannot kneel in front of them.

1295
01:24:23,876 --> 01:24:27,792
It's time to end this enmity forever.

1296
01:24:46,042 --> 01:24:47,584
I've often seen and heard...

1297
01:24:47,917 --> 01:24:51,876
...that years of friendship
one day turns into a relationship.

1298
01:24:52,751 --> 01:24:55,417
But Malik, this is the first time...

1299
01:24:55,584 --> 01:24:59,584
...when an old enmity is
turning into a relationship.

1300
01:25:00,001 --> 01:25:03,792
There's another way
to end the enmity, Randhir.

1301
01:25:04,376 --> 01:25:06,292
Kill the enemy.

1302
01:25:08,084 --> 01:25:08,751
Where's Meera?

1303
01:25:08,876 --> 01:25:13,167
You see, Kaali...
Meera loves you a lot.

1304
01:25:13,501 --> 01:25:17,667
She couldn't have seen
you and your father die.

1305
01:26:05,167 --> 01:26:08,626
Meera...Kaali and his
father have deceived us.

1306
01:26:09,376 --> 01:26:10,959
They have attacked us.

1307
01:27:23,417 --> 01:27:24,167
Dad!

1308
01:27:31,084 --> 01:27:32,084
Dad!

1309
01:29:21,001 --> 01:29:23,042
Try to understand, Meera.

1310
01:29:23,459 --> 01:29:26,751
Randhir Bakshi's men won't
stay quiet after what happened.

1311
01:29:27,459 --> 01:29:29,501
If not yourself,
then Think about lshita.

1312
01:29:29,709 --> 01:29:32,917
Think about how all this
will affect her when she finds out.

1313
01:29:34,042 --> 01:29:35,876
You're like a sister to me, Meera.

1314
01:29:36,501 --> 01:29:37,876
Listen to me.

1315
01:29:38,959 --> 01:29:41,126
Take lshita far away from here.

1316
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,376
And start a new life.

1317
01:29:44,084 --> 01:29:46,834
We'll always protect you.

1318
01:29:49,042 --> 01:29:51,917
Meera has gone far away.

1319
01:29:54,584 --> 01:29:56,959
No one knows where.

1320
01:29:58,584 --> 01:30:01,542
But I want to see Meera at any cost.

1321
01:30:02,084 --> 01:30:04,001
I must tell her what happened there.

1322
01:30:04,084 --> 01:30:07,042
Kaali, I am not too intelligent.

1323
01:30:07,417 --> 01:30:10,376
But all this bloodshed
has taught me one thing.

1324
01:30:10,542 --> 01:30:13,001
There's no meaning to this life.

1325
01:30:13,417 --> 01:30:17,251
It's best if you forget
everything...and think about Veer.

1326
01:30:17,709 --> 01:30:19,084
Let's go together...

1327
01:30:19,417 --> 01:30:21,834
We'll start a new life. Right?

1328
01:30:48,667 --> 01:30:50,292
It's hard to believe...

1329
01:30:51,251 --> 01:30:56,084
...that fate's repeating
the same story 15 years later.

1330
01:30:57,876 --> 01:31:00,917
Seems like we're back
to square one .

1331
01:31:01,167 --> 01:31:01,834
Yeah, Raj.

1332
01:31:01,959 --> 01:31:03,667
There are many other
Countries in the world...

1333
01:31:03,751 --> 01:31:05,626
...other than India and Bulgaria.

1334
01:31:05,751 --> 01:31:08,876
But...they had to open
a hotel at this place.

1335
01:31:10,167 --> 01:31:13,542
All these years I
hid this truth from Veer...

1336
01:31:15,084 --> 01:31:17,459
...and he shouldn't find out now either.

1337
01:31:18,584 --> 01:31:21,251
We must stop Veer at any cost.

1338
01:31:22,334 --> 01:31:23,917
And anyway...Meera...

1339
01:31:25,501 --> 01:31:26,917
Will never agree to this relation.

1340
01:31:27,042 --> 01:31:28,709
But I want to know...

1341
01:31:28,959 --> 01:31:30,376
...what's the reason
behind your rejection.

1342
01:31:30,501 --> 01:31:32,084
It's a big one, that's it.

1343
01:31:32,292 --> 01:31:34,751
I do not want any more discussion
over this, lshu

1344
01:31:34,876 --> 01:31:35,417
Forget him.

1345
01:31:35,542 --> 01:31:36,459
But why?

1346
01:31:36,584 --> 01:31:38,584
What happened between
lshita's sister and you...

1347
01:31:38,751 --> 01:31:40,584
...that you said no.

1348
01:31:40,876 --> 01:31:43,501
I already told you...
you won't ask any more questions.

1349
01:31:43,626 --> 01:31:45,126
There's some reason.
- Brother...

1350
01:31:45,251 --> 01:31:48,751
Veer! There's a reason.

1351
01:31:54,917 --> 01:31:57,584
It's a serious matter.
- But what is the matter.

1352
01:31:57,834 --> 01:31:59,376
Look Sid, it's clear that...

1353
01:31:59,501 --> 01:32:01,459
...Raj brother knows Meera, otherwise...

1354
01:32:01,667 --> 01:32:03,542
...what can be the reason to say no.

1355
01:32:04,084 --> 01:32:06,626
Who knows about your brother's past?
- brother knows.

1356
01:32:06,751 --> 01:32:07,667
The answer's correct...

1357
01:32:07,751 --> 01:32:08,876
...but the direction is wrong.

1358
01:32:09,001 --> 01:32:11,001
The person who knows about
your brother's past...

1359
01:32:12,751 --> 01:32:14,042
...is my brother!

1360
01:32:14,209 --> 01:32:15,334
Peter.

1361
01:32:15,459 --> 01:32:17,292
Feed him something special today
and don't charge him.

1362
01:32:17,417 --> 01:32:19,376
Come on.
- I said I don't know.

1363
01:32:19,542 --> 01:32:21,542
Now go away,
I've a lot of customers to attend to.

1364
01:32:22,001 --> 01:32:23,334
Yogesh...are you going
to order something...

1365
01:32:23,459 --> 01:32:24,751
...or take this TV home.

1366
01:32:24,917 --> 01:32:26,251
I'll place my order in five minutes.

1367
01:32:26,417 --> 01:32:28,626
You definitely know something.
You must tell me today.

1368
01:32:28,751 --> 01:32:29,334
What?

1369
01:32:29,459 --> 01:32:31,751
I won't budge until you don't tell me.

1370
01:32:31,834 --> 01:32:33,876
Brother Shakti, please say something.

1371
01:32:34,959 --> 01:32:37,334
Anwar brother...please
tell us their story.

1372
01:32:37,584 --> 01:32:40,542
No...Anwar brother, for my sake...
please tell us.

1373
01:32:40,751 --> 01:32:42,042
Don't do this.

1374
01:32:44,126 --> 01:32:45,542
Their story?

1375
01:32:46,376 --> 01:32:48,292
They were thieves.
- Anwar!

1376
01:32:48,376 --> 01:32:49,501
Thieves?
- Thieves?

1377
01:32:50,001 --> 01:32:51,042
Anwar!

1378
01:32:51,834 --> 01:32:54,834
He means...they stole
each other's heart.

1379
01:32:55,126 --> 01:32:57,626
Raj and Meera had an affair.

1380
01:32:57,709 --> 01:32:59,917
Brother, please tell
us from the beginning. - Yes.

1381
01:33:00,084 --> 01:33:03,001
Your brother's real
name was never Raj. - Anwar!

1382
01:33:03,501 --> 01:33:06,251
He means...his real name was...

1383
01:33:06,292 --> 01:33:07,126
Ramlal.

1384
01:33:07,292 --> 01:33:08,834
Ramlal!
- Ramlal?

1385
01:33:09,001 --> 01:33:10,834
And he loved bashing...

1386
01:33:11,042 --> 01:33:15,126
He means he loved cleaning clothes.

1387
01:33:15,376 --> 01:33:16,834
Why?
- Because Ramlal was a washerman.

1388
01:33:16,959 --> 01:33:17,834
Brother was a washerman.

1389
01:33:17,959 --> 01:33:20,417
Then lshita's sister
must have a real name too.

1390
01:33:20,584 --> 01:33:22,959
Ishita's sister's real name...

1391
01:33:24,959 --> 01:33:26,501
P090!
'P090?

1392
01:33:27,209 --> 01:33:28,792
Ramlal and Pogo...

1393
01:33:28,876 --> 01:33:31,001
How did they meet?
- Meet...how?

1394
01:33:33,876 --> 01:33:35,542
One day Pogo was walking all alone...

1395
01:33:35,667 --> 01:33:37,001
...when some goons came after her.

1396
01:33:37,167 --> 01:33:39,042
That's when Ramlal
slammed them to the ground.

1397
01:33:39,209 --> 01:33:41,417
How can brother slam anyone...
- He was a washerman...

1398
01:33:41,501 --> 01:33:42,667
So he slammed them on the ground.

1399
01:33:42,792 --> 01:33:45,792
Then? - Then Pogo met
him every morning for tea.

1400
01:33:45,876 --> 01:33:47,251
Then?
- Then“.

1401
01:33:47,959 --> 01:33:49,001
They would meet in
the evening in toilets.

1402
01:33:49,126 --> 01:33:50,667
Why the toilet?

1403
01:33:51,501 --> 01:33:52,626
Hand pump.
- Yeah.

1404
01:33:52,751 --> 01:33:54,167
Because Ramlal would wash his clothes...

1405
01:33:54,292 --> 01:33:55,667
...at the hand pump which
was below Pogo's toilet.

1406
01:33:55,792 --> 01:33:58,126
If their love was so pumped up...

1407
01:33:58,292 --> 01:33:59,959
...then how did it turn into hatred?

1408
01:34:00,084 --> 01:34:01,417
Hatred...

1409
01:34:03,001 --> 01:34:04,001
Gold is my God.

1410
01:34:04,209 --> 01:34:07,542
Pogo loved diamonds,
jewels, gold and silver.

1411
01:34:07,709 --> 01:34:09,792
Their love story was somewhat like...

1412
01:34:10,001 --> 01:34:11,626
'Khana Khazana' (Cookery Show).

1413
01:34:11,751 --> 01:34:13,209
'Khana Khazana'...
what are you saying?

1414
01:34:13,292 --> 01:34:15,209
Because Ramlal could
barely manage a square meal...

1415
01:34:15,292 --> 01:34:16,959
...and Pogo was looking for treasure.

1416
01:34:17,084 --> 01:34:19,417
Then? - And one day...
tired of all the arguments...

1417
01:34:19,501 --> 01:34:22,292
...your brother turned
into a... 'Chakka' (Eunuch).

1418
01:34:22,376 --> 01:34:23,792
Brother turned into a...
'Chakka' (Eunuch)...How's this?

1419
01:34:23,917 --> 01:34:25,834
He means to say...

1420
01:34:26,292 --> 01:34:27,209
Yes, brother turned
into a... 'Chakka' (Eunuch).

1421
01:34:27,292 --> 01:34:28,542
Brother turned into
a... 'Chakka' (Eunuch) again.

1422
01:34:28,709 --> 01:34:31,167
Veer, this is why he never got married.
- You shut up.

1423
01:34:31,292 --> 01:34:33,209
I mean Ramlal was devastated...

1424
01:34:33,292 --> 01:34:35,334
...because he couldn't
fulfill Pogo's demands.

1425
01:34:35,501 --> 01:34:36,542
And in between those two...

1426
01:34:36,709 --> 01:34:37,792
'Daraar' (Void).

1427
01:34:37,959 --> 01:34:38,834
'Judaai' (Separation).

1428
01:34:39,167 --> 01:34:40,167
'Dushmani' (Enmity).

1429
01:34:40,292 --> 01:34:41,126
'Tashan' (Style).

1430
01:34:41,334 --> 01:34:42,459
Oh my, God.

1431
01:34:42,584 --> 01:34:45,667
"Oh my, God" In between them?
- It's just an expression.

1432
01:34:45,834 --> 01:34:48,542
Don't people say "Oh my,
God" when someone separates.

1433
01:34:48,792 --> 01:34:51,667
Peter...cut-off that customer's finger.

1434
01:34:51,876 --> 01:34:54,501
Who keeps pressing
the remote so frequently?

1435
01:34:56,001 --> 01:34:57,501
Brother Shakti, I remember...

1436
01:34:57,667 --> 01:35:00,792
...when dad and brother used
to come meet me at the hostel...

1437
01:35:00,959 --> 01:35:02,542
...they always wore good clothes...

1438
01:35:02,667 --> 01:35:04,334
...and came in big cars, we were rich.

1439
01:35:04,709 --> 01:35:07,001
Because your brother was a washerman.

1440
01:35:07,126 --> 01:35:09,334
He used to wear his
customer's clothes.

1441
01:35:09,459 --> 01:35:11,126
And your dad was a mechanic.

1442
01:35:11,292 --> 01:35:13,334
He would drive his customer's car.

1443
01:35:13,459 --> 01:35:14,709
Just like you do.

1444
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:16,501
You're a mechanic as well.

1445
01:35:16,584 --> 01:35:18,959
Go and fix cars...go on!

1446
01:35:19,209 --> 01:35:20,001
Go!

1447
01:35:20,126 --> 01:35:21,126
Brother...

1448
01:35:21,292 --> 01:35:22,917
Was our father a waiter or...

1449
01:35:23,001 --> 01:35:25,501
You get lost to...come on, get out.

1450
01:35:25,792 --> 01:35:29,792
Such an emotional story.

1451
01:35:30,501 --> 01:35:31,834
This is wrong.

1452
01:35:33,126 --> 01:35:34,667
- Anwar brother...

1453
01:35:36,209 --> 01:35:38,792
Who asked you to open your mouth?

1454
01:35:39,334 --> 01:35:42,042
Shakti, The children made me emotional.

1455
01:35:43,292 --> 01:35:44,334
Your emotion...

1456
01:35:45,501 --> 01:35:49,251
That's all fine,
but why didn't you two get married?

1457
01:35:51,126 --> 01:35:52,126
Come here.

1458
01:35:53,501 --> 01:35:57,167
You...take that...
so many questions.

1459
01:35:58,042 --> 01:35:59,417
Don't hit.
I just asked a question.

1460
01:35:59,542 --> 01:36:02,334
Because we didn't
want to become fathers.

1461
01:36:11,584 --> 01:36:16,126
See...he's still washing
everyone's clothes.

1462
01:36:18,542 --> 01:36:19,834
Ramlal!

1463
01:36:23,292 --> 01:36:24,667
Hey Ramlal?

1464
01:36:32,167 --> 01:36:33,501
What are you doing?

1465
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:34,834
What are you two doing?

1466
01:36:35,001 --> 01:36:36,334
Let go of me, please...
what happened?

1467
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:41,834
Brother Shakti and Anwar
told us everything about your past.

1468
01:36:43,626 --> 01:36:45,959
Oh... Everything?

1469
01:36:47,626 --> 01:36:51,792
Brother...you would use these
hands to wipe them, isn't it?

1470
01:36:52,334 --> 01:36:53,334
Whose?

1471
01:36:55,292 --> 01:36:58,251
Brother, why are you so worried?
- No, I am not worried.

1472
01:36:58,334 --> 01:37:00,042
You weren't a beggar.

1473
01:37:00,292 --> 01:37:02,126
You were a washerman.

1474
01:37:02,876 --> 01:37:04,126
Washerman!?

1475
01:37:04,709 --> 01:37:06,251
I am washerman?

1476
01:37:06,376 --> 01:37:10,501
Brother...we know everything
about Ramlal and Pogo.

1477
01:37:10,876 --> 01:37:11,834
Ramlal?

1478
01:37:12,209 --> 01:37:12,792
Who?

1479
01:37:13,292 --> 01:37:14,001
P090?

1480
01:37:14,501 --> 01:37:16,834
Give me this.
Now we'll do all this.

1481
01:37:17,001 --> 01:37:17,709
Okay.

1482
01:37:17,834 --> 01:37:19,001
You Go!

1483
01:37:19,959 --> 01:37:21,042
Okay, okay...

1484
01:37:23,001 --> 01:37:24,251
Bye, Ramlal.

1485
01:37:25,334 --> 01:37:28,501
Ramlal? Pogo? Washerman?

1486
01:37:28,792 --> 01:37:31,501
Raj, you said Veer should
never learn about the truth.

1487
01:37:31,626 --> 01:37:34,959
But I never said that
You should turn me into Ramlal.

1488
01:37:35,292 --> 01:37:37,167
We were Mafia, man.
- Yeah, that's right

1489
01:37:37,292 --> 01:37:39,501
But they just pounced
on us...made us swear too...

1490
01:37:39,626 --> 01:37:40,459
What else could we do?

1491
01:37:40,542 --> 01:37:42,251
You could've said you don't know.
Don't know.

1492
01:37:42,376 --> 01:37:43,626
Why don't we know?

1493
01:37:43,709 --> 01:37:45,042
We've been together for so long.

1494
01:37:45,126 --> 01:37:47,042
And Raj... even we have some honor.
Isn't it brother?

1495
01:37:47,167 --> 01:37:49,251
Ohh...that's why you tarnished mine.

1496
01:37:49,334 --> 01:37:52,126
Look at my personality,
Do I look like Ramlal from any angle?

1497
01:37:52,292 --> 01:37:53,959
Kaali...sorry...

1498
01:37:54,167 --> 01:37:56,459
Why are you getting so furious?

1499
01:37:56,667 --> 01:37:58,251
Because I know Veer too well.

1500
01:37:58,334 --> 01:37:59,459
He won't stay quiet.

1501
01:37:59,626 --> 01:38:03,251
He'll do something worse
than the story you just cooked up.

1502
01:38:04,709 --> 01:38:05,917
And who's Pogo?

1503
01:38:06,042 --> 01:38:06,917
P090?

1504
01:38:07,001 --> 01:38:08,126
My Sister's name was Pogo?

1505
01:38:08,209 --> 01:38:09,292
I don't believe this story.

1506
01:38:09,376 --> 01:38:11,792
And my sister left
your brother for money.

1507
01:38:11,876 --> 01:38:13,917
How can this be true?
- Ishu, I heard this...

1508
01:38:14,001 --> 01:38:15,417
...from one of brother's old friend.

1509
01:38:15,501 --> 01:38:17,292
His...brother.

1510
01:38:17,542 --> 01:38:18,917
It's all true.

1511
01:38:19,334 --> 01:38:20,792
What about us now?

1512
01:38:21,042 --> 01:38:24,667
Do one thing ...why don't you
two disappear for a few days.

1513
01:38:24,959 --> 01:38:27,167
Who knows...maybe out of worry
Ramlal and Pogo melt?

1514
01:38:27,292 --> 01:38:29,501
Jenny...they're not some
ice-cream that will melt.

1515
01:38:29,626 --> 01:38:32,334
I say that you two should
run away and get married.

1516
01:38:33,209 --> 01:38:36,334
No...my sister's done a lot for me.

1517
01:38:36,834 --> 01:38:38,251
I cannot hurt her like this.

1518
01:38:38,459 --> 01:38:40,626
Even I can't do this
with brother either.

1519
01:38:42,042 --> 01:38:43,001
Hold on.

1520
01:38:43,292 --> 01:38:48,542
Ishu...why didn't my brother and your
sister ever get married to someone else?

1521
01:38:48,709 --> 01:38:49,626
Why?

1522
01:38:50,001 --> 01:38:52,667
Because...they haven't
forgotten their memories...

1523
01:38:52,792 --> 01:38:54,792
...and their daily one-night stands.

1524
01:38:54,876 --> 01:38:56,501
Veer...you're talking about my sister.

1525
01:38:56,584 --> 01:38:58,167
Don't get into the details...
come to the point.

1526
01:38:58,292 --> 01:39:00,292
If they did love each other...

1527
01:39:00,376 --> 01:39:02,417
...then how about we
rekindle that love again?

1528
01:39:02,584 --> 01:39:04,126
And patch them up.

1529
01:39:04,292 --> 01:39:05,167
What do you say?

1530
01:39:05,292 --> 01:39:07,667
That can solve our problems.
- Exactly.

1531
01:39:07,834 --> 01:39:09,334
But how do we patch things up?

1532
01:39:09,501 --> 01:39:10,667
How?

1533
01:39:11,167 --> 01:39:12,834
Only God knows that.

1534
01:39:42,292 --> 01:39:45,292
Patrick, I've heard some new
restaurant has opened up in Panjim.

1535
01:39:45,542 --> 01:39:47,542
Yes, the owner is
some woman called Meera.

1536
01:39:47,667 --> 01:39:51,126
So go talk to her...and our stuff..

1537
01:39:53,584 --> 01:39:56,251
Dude...where's my car.

1538
01:39:56,376 --> 01:39:57,334
There...

1539
01:39:57,959 --> 01:39:59,834
Where's my car?

1540
01:40:00,667 --> 01:40:03,709
Patrick, it had drugs worth millions.

1541
01:40:03,876 --> 01:40:04,834
What?

1542
01:40:04,959 --> 01:40:05,667
Veer...

1543
01:40:06,501 --> 01:40:09,959
I got a superb idea to get
Ramlal and Pogo back together.

1544
01:40:10,084 --> 01:40:10,709
What?

1545
01:40:10,834 --> 01:40:12,501
We'll hire some goons...

1546
01:40:12,626 --> 01:40:14,042
...and tell them to chase Pogo.

1547
01:40:14,167 --> 01:40:16,459
The hero makes a dynamic entry...

1548
01:40:16,626 --> 01:40:18,626
...when the villains
chasing the heroine.

1549
01:40:18,751 --> 01:40:20,042
Villain's pack up...

1550
01:40:20,209 --> 01:40:22,292
...and the hero-heroine will patch-up.

1551
01:40:22,417 --> 01:40:23,417
What patch up?

1552
01:40:23,501 --> 01:40:26,792
What an ancient idea
to rekindle old love, Sid.

1553
01:40:26,917 --> 01:40:30,959
Veer...the oldest wine
is the most intoxicating one.

1554
01:40:31,084 --> 01:40:33,084
Just say yes...and then see...

1555
01:40:33,251 --> 01:40:35,959
I'm sure you'll say...
"What a plan".

1556
01:40:38,751 --> 01:40:41,084
Who will pose as the goon?
- We'll find someone.

1557
01:40:45,626 --> 01:40:47,542
That's King's car.

1558
01:40:48,251 --> 01:40:50,626
Why are you driving
around in King's car?

1559
01:40:51,001 --> 01:40:53,292
I didn't know it was
King's car when I stole it.

1560
01:40:53,417 --> 01:40:55,417
You mean you stole it.
- That too King's car.

1561
01:40:55,501 --> 01:40:58,709
Exactly...what will King
do when he finds out?

1562
01:40:58,792 --> 01:41:00,542
So change its color...

1563
01:41:00,667 --> 01:41:02,626
...so I can sell it to someone in Goa.

1564
01:41:02,751 --> 01:41:05,709
Mani, you know I will never
help you with stolen stuff.

1565
01:41:05,876 --> 01:41:07,376
But the guy whose car you stole...

1566
01:41:07,501 --> 01:41:09,417
...I've got a score
to settle with him too.

1567
01:41:10,917 --> 01:41:12,876
But first we must hide
this car from brother Raj.

1568
01:41:13,001 --> 01:41:14,792
Tavde“.
- Yes, brother.

1569
01:41:15,084 --> 01:41:17,084
Hide the car...and
don't tell brother Raj.

1570
01:41:17,209 --> 01:41:17,959
You want me to lie to Raj sir?

1571
01:41:18,084 --> 01:41:19,876
How about I tell him
you've got a girl. Get lost

1572
01:41:20,001 --> 01:41:21,459
Pinto, come on.

1573
01:41:23,209 --> 01:41:27,459
I will never forget
what you two have done for me.

1574
01:41:27,626 --> 01:41:29,626
Look, I've said this to brother Raj...

1575
01:41:29,751 --> 01:41:30,959
...and I'm saying it again to you.

1576
01:41:31,084 --> 01:41:34,084
If there's anything I can do for you...

1577
01:41:34,251 --> 01:41:35,126
...just let me know.

1578
01:41:35,251 --> 01:41:38,792
I'll stand
by you head over heels.

1579
01:41:38,917 --> 01:41:42,626
Mani bhai, we do need help.
- Say it!

1580
01:41:42,751 --> 01:41:45,626
Okay. You need to
pretend as a goon for us.

1581
01:41:45,751 --> 01:41:46,542
Goon?

1582
01:41:46,667 --> 01:41:48,917
Brother Raj's love story is stuck.

1583
01:41:49,084 --> 01:41:49,834
Huh!

1584
01:41:49,917 --> 01:41:51,542
Hero and Heroine will patch-up...

1585
01:41:51,667 --> 01:41:54,376
...when you trouble
the girl as the villain.

1586
01:41:54,584 --> 01:41:55,792
Will you, Mani bhai.?

1587
01:41:55,917 --> 01:41:59,959
I can even give up
my life for brother Raj.

1588
01:42:01,084 --> 01:42:03,626
Name, place,
animal, thing...just name it.

1589
01:42:03,709 --> 01:42:04,834
Say it!

1590
01:42:04,959 --> 01:42:06,709
Mani bhai, just handle it.

1591
01:42:06,792 --> 01:42:08,334
Everything lies in your hands now.

1592
01:42:08,459 --> 01:42:09,459
Don't mess it up.

1593
01:42:10,542 --> 01:42:12,459
Look Veer, she's coming.

1594
01:42:12,959 --> 01:42:15,917
All the best. - All the best...
careful with the loin-cloth!

1595
01:42:26,459 --> 01:42:28,251
Do you want to die? Get out of the way.

1596
01:42:28,417 --> 01:42:31,334
Just one question.
- What?

1597
01:42:31,501 --> 01:42:34,834
Is there a Chintu in your home?
- No.

1598
01:42:34,917 --> 01:42:35,917
That's it...

1599
01:42:36,126 --> 01:42:41,584
Give me one chance...
and you'll get a Chintu.

1600
01:42:47,626 --> 01:42:48,542
What a plan.

1601
01:42:48,667 --> 01:42:50,959
And according to the time Raj
will be coming through any minute.

1602
01:42:51,084 --> 01:42:56,459
Now you'll say
"What are your intentions".

1603
01:42:56,792 --> 01:42:57,667
And I'll say...

1604
01:43:00,042 --> 01:43:04,126
Next you'll say
"Don't come any closer".

1605
01:43:04,292 --> 01:43:05,501
I'll say...

1606
01:43:07,709 --> 01:43:10,834
Then you'll say "Help".

1607
01:43:11,167 --> 01:43:13,626
And I'll say "Scream".

1608
01:43:14,792 --> 01:43:18,626
But no one will come to save you.

1609
01:43:20,334 --> 01:43:21,626
Mani's acting so well.

1610
01:43:21,834 --> 01:43:22,959
What a plan.

1611
01:43:23,542 --> 01:43:25,667
And then you'll come closer.

1612
01:43:26,084 --> 01:43:26,834
Yes.

1613
01:43:27,001 --> 01:43:28,876
And hold my hand tightly.

1614
01:43:29,001 --> 01:43:29,834
Yes!

1615
01:43:29,959 --> 01:43:31,792
That's when you'll realize...

1616
01:43:31,959 --> 01:43:34,251
...there's actually no one to help...

1617
01:43:34,417 --> 01:43:36,584
No one. No one. Correct!

1618
01:43:37,167 --> 01:43:37,751
You!

1619
01:43:37,834 --> 01:43:38,751
Me.

1620
01:43:44,626 --> 01:43:46,001
What are you taking out?

1621
01:43:47,792 --> 01:43:49,501
This is cheating.

1622
01:43:50,667 --> 01:43:52,376
I don't hit women.

1623
01:43:53,917 --> 01:43:55,584
I spare you because you're a woman.

1624
01:43:56,542 --> 01:43:57,917
Hit like a woman...

1625
01:43:58,209 --> 01:43:59,876
Why are you hitting like a man?

1626
01:44:01,334 --> 01:44:02,667
She's letting him have it!

1627
01:44:03,667 --> 01:44:04,792
He") me!

1628
01:44:05,084 --> 01:44:06,751
Where are you going?

1629
01:44:14,417 --> 01:44:17,917
Pogo channel turned into WWF.

1630
01:44:18,292 --> 01:44:23,084
She smashed me up...

1631
01:44:23,709 --> 01:44:29,667
She smashed me up...
Even these two abandoned me.

1632
01:44:29,834 --> 01:44:31,251
Seriously, this is the limit guys.

1633
01:44:31,709 --> 01:44:33,001
Is this the way?

1634
01:44:33,167 --> 01:44:34,834
And who comes up with such ideas?
- He does.

1635
01:44:35,542 --> 01:44:36,876
Get sister in trouble...
brother will save her...

1636
01:44:37,042 --> 01:44:38,001
...and those two will fall in love.

1637
01:44:38,167 --> 01:44:39,084
That's the limit.

1638
01:44:39,251 --> 01:44:41,292
Have you lost your mind, Veer?

1639
01:44:41,751 --> 01:44:42,751
Brother...
- Veer...

1640
01:44:43,792 --> 01:44:45,001
And what do you guys think...

1641
01:44:45,167 --> 01:44:46,792
...by doing this, she ..

1642
01:44:49,251 --> 01:44:50,959
That relation is over.

1643
01:44:51,751 --> 01:44:52,751
You will gain nothing.

1644
01:44:53,001 --> 01:44:53,917
There's no point.

1645
01:44:54,084 --> 01:44:55,834
Veer...all this doesn't look good.

1646
01:44:56,084 --> 01:44:58,251
Don't be such a fool.
Everything is over.

1647
01:44:58,376 --> 01:45:00,251
How can you say that?

1648
01:45:02,542 --> 01:45:05,667
Brother...
firstly I am not ready to believe...

1649
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:07,751
...that sister left you for money.

1650
01:45:08,542 --> 01:45:10,292
And even if she did...

1651
01:45:11,459 --> 01:45:13,584
...then why didn't
she marry someone else?

1652
01:45:16,459 --> 01:45:19,251
You're on the right track...
bombard him with another one.

1653
01:45:20,084 --> 01:45:23,459
Why didn't she make anyone
else her life-partner?

1654
01:45:25,042 --> 01:45:26,417
Go on. Go on.

1655
01:45:26,542 --> 01:45:28,501
And even brother didn't
marry anyone else, right?

1656
01:45:28,751 --> 01:45:30,251
Yes, why?

1657
01:45:30,417 --> 01:45:33,417
Even you didn't find
anyone else for yourself.

1658
01:45:33,542 --> 01:45:37,251
You never even went on a three
night-four day tour with some girl.

1659
01:45:38,792 --> 01:45:42,501
Brother Raj...only you
know what's in your heart.

1660
01:45:43,459 --> 01:45:46,501
But I've understood
what's in sister's heart.

1661
01:45:46,834 --> 01:45:50,501
Regardless of what
happened between you two...

1662
01:45:50,792 --> 01:45:53,292
...she still hasn't
forgotten her first love.

1663
01:45:59,917 --> 01:46:01,251
Veer, deliver the car.

1664
01:46:07,459 --> 01:46:08,959
Brother's melting.

1665
01:46:09,084 --> 01:46:12,167
Brother, I've another plan.

1666
01:46:12,542 --> 01:46:14,542
Mani bhai...
- Shut up!

1667
01:46:15,501 --> 01:46:17,209
I've to attend a meeting.

1668
01:46:17,334 --> 01:46:19,751
Wrap up everything
here and come home. Okay thanks.

1669
01:46:20,042 --> 01:46:21,542
Bye.
- Bye.

1670
01:46:29,542 --> 01:46:32,042
This car will definitely
break-down before it reaches Panjim.

1671
01:46:32,292 --> 01:46:34,584
And like every day,
brother will pass-by.

1672
01:46:34,709 --> 01:46:36,542
Ishita, something will
definitely happen today.

1673
01:47:47,792 --> 01:47:52,792
"Walk with me...in every lifetime."

1674
01:47:53,334 --> 01:47:58,251
"Promise me...
you'll come back to me right here"

1675
01:47:58,417 --> 01:48:03,626
"We're one soul...
even if we're two bodies."

1676
01:48:04,042 --> 01:48:09,001
"Always be mine...
don't ever say goodbye."

1677
01:48:09,334 --> 01:48:14,501
"You're my dawn...
and you're my twilight."

1678
01:48:15,376 --> 01:48:19,917
"You're the pain...
and you're the comfort."

1679
01:48:20,167 --> 01:48:25,292
"There's only one thing
I ever pray for in my mind."

1680
01:48:25,792 --> 01:48:30,792
"Always be mine...
don't ever say goodbye."

1681
01:48:47,667 --> 01:48:52,667
"Always be mine...
don't ever say...

1682
01:48:53,542 --> 01:48:58,501
"Both my world lie in your arms."

1683
01:48:59,001 --> 01:49:03,792
"My heaven is wherever you are."

1684
01:49:04,376 --> 01:49:09,292
"Desire's are burning
in both our hearts."

1685
01:49:09,876 --> 01:49:14,501
"I wish my prayers
are never unanswered."

1686
01:49:14,709 --> 01:49:19,876
"You're my desire, I am your love."

1687
01:49:20,209 --> 01:49:25,751
"You're my poem...l am your music."

1688
01:49:26,042 --> 01:49:31,042
"You...You...
You're the one I crave for."

1689
01:49:31,417 --> 01:49:36,126
"Become the intoxication in my veins
and keep flowing.

1690
01:49:36,417 --> 01:49:41,542
"Repay my love in this way."

1691
01:49:42,167 --> 01:49:47,959
"Always be mine...
don't ever say goodbye."

1692
01:49:50,167 --> 01:49:52,626
n---goodbye-n

1693
01:50:32,542 --> 01:50:34,584
Veer, superb buddy.

1694
01:50:34,751 --> 01:50:36,917
You've done an amazing job.

1695
01:50:37,167 --> 01:50:38,917
You completely changed
the look of the car.

1696
01:50:39,042 --> 01:50:42,501
Even King can never recognize it.

1697
01:50:43,542 --> 01:50:45,209
Veer, what's wrong?

1698
01:50:45,417 --> 01:50:47,084
Why are you in a bad mood?

1699
01:50:48,292 --> 01:50:49,792
No matter how hard we try...

1700
01:50:49,876 --> 01:50:51,876
...Pogo and brother's
love story doesn't pick up.

1701
01:50:52,001 --> 01:50:54,001
I don't know what to do now.

1702
01:50:54,167 --> 01:50:57,084
Veer...l do have an idea.

1703
01:50:57,209 --> 01:50:59,501
No more idea. No, buddy no..
- It's sure shot, please.

1704
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:01,501
At least hear me out. Hear me out.

1705
01:51:01,542 --> 01:51:04,709
What if we rekindle their passion?

1706
01:51:05,042 --> 01:51:06,626
Passion? How?

1707
01:51:06,834 --> 01:51:08,834
There's a new film playing
in Edward's Theatre.

1708
01:51:09,042 --> 01:51:11,292
Let's buy corner
seat tickets for them.

1709
01:51:11,417 --> 01:51:12,542
They'll watch the film together...

1710
01:51:12,667 --> 01:51:14,542
...and rekindle their passion.

1711
01:51:15,001 --> 01:51:17,126
What film? - 'Tamboo Mein Dhoom-Dham'
(Indian C-grade film).

1712
01:51:17,376 --> 01:51:18,959
Come here. Come here.

1713
01:51:19,417 --> 01:51:21,042
You and your pervert ideas.

1714
01:51:21,292 --> 01:51:22,876
Pinto, wrap the boot.

1715
01:51:23,042 --> 01:51:25,709
It's a nice film. I've seen it myself.

1716
01:51:27,167 --> 01:51:28,876
Brother, there's a bag in here.

1717
01:51:32,376 --> 01:51:34,376
Whose bag is this?

1718
01:51:35,334 --> 01:51:37,126
I guess it Mani bhai's.

1719
01:51:37,542 --> 01:51:39,584
This isn't my bag.
- What?

1720
01:51:39,751 --> 01:51:42,501
Then whose bag is it?
- I don't know.

1721
01:51:42,667 --> 01:51:43,626
Open it.

1722
01:51:46,126 --> 01:51:48,001
Oh God...drugs!

1723
01:51:48,126 --> 01:51:51,501
Drugs! This is
definitely King's stuff.

1724
01:51:51,542 --> 01:51:53,209
What do we do with it now?

1725
01:51:54,501 --> 01:51:56,334
If these drugs get out in the market...

1726
01:51:56,542 --> 01:51:58,709
...there's no telling how
many will fall prey to it.

1727
01:51:58,876 --> 01:52:00,542
Then what do we do it.

1728
01:52:03,292 --> 01:52:04,251
Let's burn it.

1729
01:52:04,376 --> 01:52:08,292
These drugs were going
to ruin the entire youth.

1730
01:52:08,751 --> 01:52:13,667
King...l really enjoyed
burning your stuff.

1731
01:52:14,001 --> 01:52:17,042
I think Mani bhai is drunk.
- Drunk?

1732
01:52:17,209 --> 01:52:18,417
He's completely over the top.

1733
01:52:18,542 --> 01:52:21,376
Mani bhai, control.
- What control?

1734
01:52:21,834 --> 01:52:23,751
Lose control!

1735
01:52:23,876 --> 01:52:25,834
Lose control!

1736
01:52:28,376 --> 01:52:29,834
What..

1737
01:52:33,251 --> 01:52:33,834
King!

1738
01:52:33,917 --> 01:52:34,876
King!

1739
01:52:36,834 --> 01:52:38,334
What are you guys burning?

1740
01:52:40,542 --> 01:52:41,459
What are you guys burning tell me?

1741
01:52:41,542 --> 01:52:44,667
We're burning the stuff from the car.
- What?

1742
01:52:45,292 --> 01:52:47,126
You see...once a month...

1743
01:52:47,334 --> 01:52:50,709
...we burn all the scrap
from the garage in a bonfire.

1744
01:52:51,292 --> 01:52:53,334
Sir...what are you doing here?

1745
01:52:53,917 --> 01:52:57,501
My car's broken down.
- We'll fix it.

1746
01:53:01,126 --> 01:53:03,042
Yeah...
- Ignition.

1747
01:53:07,542 --> 01:53:08,542
What?

1748
01:53:09,542 --> 01:53:10,751
Why are you laughing?

1749
01:53:11,126 --> 01:53:16,251
He's warming his hands
on the ashes of his own stuff.

1750
01:53:16,751 --> 01:53:19,709
Shut up, Mani. You'll give us away.

1751
01:53:29,792 --> 01:53:31,292
Veer...he's gone.

1752
01:53:31,584 --> 01:53:32,709
Fix it quickly.

1753
01:53:45,542 --> 01:53:50,251
King...you're looking really smart.

1754
01:53:54,501 --> 01:53:55,584
Thank you.

1755
01:53:56,501 --> 01:53:58,292
But you would look smarter...

1756
01:53:58,376 --> 01:54:01,959
...with your father's favorite car.

1757
01:54:02,667 --> 01:54:04,792
Did you find the car?

1758
01:54:05,334 --> 01:54:06,959
You didn't, right?

1759
01:54:07,542 --> 01:54:10,251
King, don't mind...he's drunk.

1760
01:54:10,501 --> 01:54:11,584
Mani...

1761
01:54:15,542 --> 01:54:20,709
King...was there something in the car?

1762
01:54:21,334 --> 01:54:23,126
You didn't find that either, did you?

1763
01:54:23,376 --> 01:54:26,084
Hey...show some manners.

1764
01:54:26,417 --> 01:54:27,417
He's King.

1765
01:54:29,542 --> 01:54:32,042
King...is my Angel.

1766
01:54:36,417 --> 01:54:37,751
King...

1767
01:54:39,334 --> 01:54:41,542
...did you find Kaali?

1768
01:54:42,667 --> 01:54:44,626
You didn't find him either.

1769
01:54:45,792 --> 01:54:48,001
King...your car's fixed.

1770
01:54:55,376 --> 01:54:56,709
Come on.

1771
01:54:58,126 --> 01:54:59,917
Mani, what are you doing?

1772
01:55:00,042 --> 01:55:01,542
Why do you drink so much?

1773
01:55:05,501 --> 01:55:08,042
Veer...Siddhu!

1774
01:55:09,334 --> 01:55:12,792
Did Ramlal and Pogo patch up?

1775
01:55:13,417 --> 01:55:15,001
They didn't either?

1776
01:55:32,667 --> 01:55:33,209
Get out!

1777
01:55:33,501 --> 01:55:35,667
We...work for King!

1778
01:55:35,834 --> 01:55:37,001
I said get out.

1779
01:55:44,792 --> 01:55:46,709
Joshua...that's Kaali!

1780
01:56:25,584 --> 01:56:26,542
What's the matter, Veer?

1781
01:56:26,667 --> 01:56:28,292
These days you've been
visiting the church quite often.

1782
01:56:28,667 --> 01:56:30,167
How did you get so religious?

1783
01:56:30,292 --> 01:56:31,167
Yes, brother.

1784
01:56:31,292 --> 01:56:33,126
There are only two things
in our life that matters.

1785
01:56:33,251 --> 01:56:34,917
Car...and Sans-kar (Values).

1786
01:56:36,792 --> 01:56:38,584
Nice church, right?

1787
01:56:42,959 --> 01:56:45,042
Brother, I'll go get the candles.

1788
01:56:45,459 --> 01:56:47,876
Wait here,
sis...I'll go get the candles.

1789
01:57:06,084 --> 01:57:07,251
Are you following me?

1790
01:57:07,417 --> 01:57:10,042
I came here with Veer.

1791
01:57:11,084 --> 01:57:11,792
Where is he?

1792
01:57:11,959 --> 01:57:14,417
Raj my boy, you here.

1793
01:57:16,084 --> 01:57:19,167
And Joshua told me...
that you're Meera.

1794
01:57:19,959 --> 01:57:21,376
Let me introduce myself.

1795
01:57:21,584 --> 01:57:24,584
I am King... Charmed.

1796
01:57:24,959 --> 01:57:26,209
It's a good thing we met...

1797
01:57:26,292 --> 01:57:28,292
I was thinking of
coming over to meet you.

1798
01:57:28,501 --> 01:57:30,917
Last night my men came to your shack...

1799
01:57:31,084 --> 01:57:33,542
...and suddenly Kaali dropped in.

1800
01:57:36,126 --> 01:57:37,584
Do you know Kaali?

1801
01:57:38,459 --> 01:57:40,459
Because if you do...then tell me.

1802
01:57:40,626 --> 01:57:43,084
And I promise you my men
will never trouble you again.

1803
01:57:43,292 --> 01:57:45,709
Of course, will finish him.

1804
01:57:51,084 --> 01:57:53,042
Do you know Kaali?

1805
01:57:56,792 --> 01:57:58,251
I don't know him!

1806
01:58:02,459 --> 01:58:05,251
Just once I lay my hand on Kaali...

1807
01:58:05,417 --> 01:58:09,459
You know what...I'll pray to
the Lord that you never find Kaali.

1808
01:58:09,917 --> 01:58:12,084
Who knows...what will happen...

1809
01:58:13,292 --> 01:58:15,001
To him...not you.

1810
01:58:15,126 --> 01:58:18,334
Yeah...Got to go, bro.
- Have a good day.

1811
01:58:28,792 --> 01:58:30,917
Oh my...

1812
01:58:33,751 --> 01:58:36,459
Veer...you did an amazing job.

1813
01:58:36,626 --> 01:58:38,917
You turned a landline
into a smartphone...

1814
01:58:39,084 --> 01:58:41,876
...and an old piece
of junk into Iron Man.

1815
01:58:42,084 --> 01:58:43,709
You turned bat into Batman...

1816
01:58:43,876 --> 01:58:45,834
...and Spider into Spider' Man.

1817
01:58:46,251 --> 01:58:47,084
Oh my...

1818
01:58:47,167 --> 01:58:49,751
Blackberry at the bottom...
and Bappi Lahiri on top.

1819
01:58:50,084 --> 01:58:51,917
I'll sell this at
the rate of an airplane.

1820
01:58:52,084 --> 01:58:53,126
By the way...what's the
rate of airplanes nowadays?

1821
01:58:53,209 --> 01:58:56,126
Forget about airplanes
and just go sell this thing.

1822
01:58:56,251 --> 01:58:57,917
This is King's car.

1823
01:58:58,084 --> 01:59:00,834
If he finds out...
- Then you'll disappear forever.

1824
01:59:00,959 --> 01:59:02,417
Oh... Correct.

1825
01:59:02,626 --> 01:59:04,417
Bravo my boy.

1826
01:59:04,501 --> 01:59:08,542
Keep this...Lux cozy...
Rupa's underwear.

1827
01:59:08,792 --> 01:59:09,834
Underwear.

1828
01:59:10,084 --> 01:59:12,126
Oscar bhai,
you look really happy today.

1829
01:59:12,292 --> 01:59:13,292
What's the matter?

1830
01:59:13,459 --> 01:59:19,709
Bloody raincoat...l could've given
you any amount you had asked for.

1831
01:59:19,876 --> 01:59:20,626
Why?

1832
01:59:20,792 --> 01:59:22,876
Because my sister just told me...

1833
01:59:23,084 --> 01:59:24,917
...that she's in love with some boy.

1834
01:59:25,084 --> 01:59:27,626
Some boy...who owns a hotel.

1835
01:59:27,751 --> 01:59:29,542
Ariel...and Harpic.

1836
01:59:29,626 --> 01:59:31,167
Yeah!

1837
01:59:31,376 --> 01:59:34,042
Tomorrow I am going to talk to his
family about their marriage.

1838
01:59:34,126 --> 01:59:35,876
And if it's fixed...

1839
01:59:36,084 --> 01:59:37,959
...then I am thinking
of presenting this...

1840
01:59:38,084 --> 01:59:40,834
...on their wedding.

1841
01:59:41,084 --> 01:59:42,334
Hold a second.

1842
01:59:42,626 --> 01:59:45,751
Should I present a gift?
Or gift a present?

1843
01:59:46,792 --> 01:59:47,709
It's the same thing, Oscar bhai.

1844
01:59:47,792 --> 01:59:48,834
A gift is a gift after all...

1845
01:59:49,084 --> 01:59:51,626
Wow...you read my heart.

1846
01:59:51,751 --> 01:59:53,584
Mani you're just a honey.

1847
01:59:54,584 --> 01:59:56,376
Jenny's here, Siddhu.

1848
01:59:56,626 --> 01:59:57,626
Jenny?

1849
01:59:57,876 --> 02:00:00,042
Hi, hi...
- What's up, Jenny?

1850
02:00:00,167 --> 02:00:01,292
Jenny, you here?

1851
02:00:01,459 --> 02:00:03,334
You could've called.

1852
02:00:03,501 --> 02:00:04,751
Guess what?
- What?

1853
02:00:04,917 --> 02:00:07,126
I told my brother everything about us.

1854
02:00:07,251 --> 02:00:09,209
And he's agreed to our marriage.
- What?

1855
02:00:09,376 --> 02:00:11,459
In fact, he's come here to meet you.

1856
02:00:11,626 --> 02:00:12,792
What are you saying, Jenny?

1857
02:00:12,959 --> 02:00:16,417
Why are you still standing?
Where is he standing?

1858
02:00:16,501 --> 02:00:17,834
Brother-in-law.
- Siddhu.

1859
02:00:18,084 --> 02:00:19,626
Where are you brother-in-law?

1860
02:00:19,792 --> 02:00:22,459
Mona Lisa...

1861
02:00:22,959 --> 02:00:24,126
Oscar bhai.

1862
02:00:25,751 --> 02:00:28,167
What are you doing?
- What are you doing here?

1863
02:00:28,292 --> 02:00:30,542
I'm here to meet
my sister's boyfriend.

1864
02:00:30,751 --> 02:00:32,917
And I am here to meet
my girlfriend's brother.

1865
02:00:33,084 --> 02:00:34,792
Where is he? Introduce me?

1866
02:00:35,084 --> 02:00:36,417
He's the one.

1867
02:00:36,501 --> 02:00:37,876
It's him.

1868
02:00:38,126 --> 02:00:39,459
You?
_ You?

1869
02:00:39,626 --> 02:00:42,126
I guess you two know each other
from before.

1870
02:00:45,501 --> 02:00:47,292
They know each other too well.

1871
02:00:47,376 --> 02:00:48,251
In and out.

1872
02:00:48,542 --> 02:00:51,376
Everything that he took
out...he would take in. Right?

1873
02:00:51,501 --> 02:00:53,292
In and out.
What are you saying?

1874
02:00:53,417 --> 02:00:55,292
Sister, I'll tell you.

1875
02:00:55,417 --> 02:00:57,626
This guy's a down-market thief.

1876
02:00:57,792 --> 02:00:59,876
Bloody fool...Colgate.. babul.

1877
02:01:00,084 --> 02:01:01,834
Thief.
Siddhu, you're a thief.

1878
02:01:02,084 --> 02:01:04,167
Well...your brother's a thief too.

1879
02:01:04,292 --> 02:01:06,292
And he's got a shop at the flea-market.
- Brother.

1880
02:01:06,459 --> 02:01:08,626
He used to buy all the goods I stole.

1881
02:01:09,209 --> 02:01:10,417
Forget your girlfriend's brother...

1882
02:01:10,584 --> 02:01:11,751
Your brother's coming.
- Brother...

1883
02:01:12,042 --> 02:01:13,292
Stop him. He'll go berserk.

1884
02:01:13,501 --> 02:01:15,251
Brother...brother...

1885
02:01:15,376 --> 02:01:18,042
Shakti, please don't...

1886
02:01:18,417 --> 02:01:20,292
Did I starve him?

1887
02:01:20,542 --> 02:01:21,834
So what was the reason...

1888
02:01:22,084 --> 02:01:23,876
Brother, this girl...

1889
02:01:24,084 --> 02:01:26,042
This girl is the reason, brother.

1890
02:01:26,876 --> 02:01:29,042
Brother, in this era you can ask
any youth like me...

1891
02:01:29,126 --> 02:01:31,542
...and he'll tell
you that finding love...

1892
02:01:31,667 --> 02:01:34,834
...has become so expensive and hard.

1893
02:01:35,084 --> 02:01:38,751
I mean...if we go watch a film
in the multiplex, that's 800 rupees.

1894
02:01:38,876 --> 02:01:41,209
And if you eat a combo
of popcorn and fritters...

1895
02:01:41,292 --> 02:01:42,417
...then it's 900 rupees.

1896
02:01:42,584 --> 02:01:45,459
And after that if your
baby says "Baby, coffee"...

1897
02:01:45,584 --> 02:01:48,542
...then treating her to coffee
costs almost 1000 rupees.

1898
02:01:48,667 --> 02:01:50,042
And all night on your
prepaid card, we do...

1899
02:01:50,251 --> 02:01:54,209
"Hello...baby, sweety, love you..."

1900
02:01:54,292 --> 02:01:57,709
Then where the 2000 rupees go,
no one knows.

1901
02:01:58,084 --> 02:02:01,042
And...gift on her birthday.

1902
02:02:01,251 --> 02:02:02,584
Gift on Valentine's Day.

1903
02:02:02,792 --> 02:02:06,167
"And baby...we met for
the first time on Friday."

1904
02:02:06,709 --> 02:02:10,542
Then every Friday...
there's a weekly anniversary gift.

1905
02:02:10,626 --> 02:02:12,209
I mean like...really...

1906
02:02:12,417 --> 02:02:14,959
So many expenses?
- You don't know.

1907
02:02:15,084 --> 02:02:17,751
Brother...your era
was completely different.

1908
02:02:17,917 --> 02:02:19,167
Your date would mean
eating corncobs and having tea...

1909
02:02:19,292 --> 02:02:22,167
...and cozying up behind stones.

1910
02:02:22,417 --> 02:02:25,251
But the girls these days
are very high maintenance.

1911
02:02:25,376 --> 02:02:26,459
Ask us...

1912
02:02:26,626 --> 02:02:29,376
We've to pay weekly at multiplexes,
coffee shops...

1913
02:02:29,459 --> 02:02:31,709
...and malls to prove our love.

1914
02:02:31,876 --> 02:02:34,417
It is not that easy.
It's bloody extortion.

1915
02:02:34,501 --> 02:02:35,417
Siddhu...

1916
02:02:35,501 --> 02:02:36,792
Relax, Siddhu...
or you'll blow a nerve.

1917
02:02:36,959 --> 02:02:38,459
Wait, I'll handle him now.

1918
02:02:38,584 --> 02:02:41,459
Siddhu .. we didn't know you were
going through so many troubles.

1919
02:02:41,626 --> 02:02:43,167
It's so expensive.

1920
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:46,376
Shakti, the poor boy's
stuck between love and expenses.

1921
02:02:46,876 --> 02:02:48,626
Puraskar bhai..
- Oscar bhai.

1922
02:02:48,751 --> 02:02:50,251
It's the same thing.
You're an award after all.

1923
02:02:50,459 --> 02:02:53,084
Siddhu's a nice guy.
- Yeah.

1924
02:02:53,251 --> 02:02:55,334
For me, Siddhu is just like Veer.

1925
02:02:55,459 --> 02:02:56,917
Oscar bhai, he's my brother.

1926
02:02:57,084 --> 02:02:59,709
We're a descent family.
No criminal records.

1927
02:02:59,876 --> 02:03:01,959
Forget that,
he loves your sister so much.

1928
02:03:02,084 --> 02:03:04,584
He's well to do.
The café, garage, property...

1929
02:03:04,751 --> 02:03:05,959
It will all belong
to these two after us.

1930
02:03:06,084 --> 02:03:08,751
Please, say yes.
- But how can I say yes.

1931
02:03:08,917 --> 02:03:09,959
Why not?

1932
02:03:10,084 --> 02:03:10,584
Why not?

1933
02:03:10,751 --> 02:03:12,542
You two are already
a match made in heaven.

1934
02:03:12,667 --> 02:03:13,626
Us?

1935
02:03:13,751 --> 02:03:17,084
You two are sailing in the same boat.

1936
02:03:17,292 --> 02:03:19,334
Don't feel embarrassed.
Feel proud of him.

1937
02:03:19,459 --> 02:03:20,042
But...

1938
02:03:20,292 --> 02:03:23,209
Brother, please say yes.
- Come on, say yes.

1939
02:03:23,417 --> 02:03:26,876
Okay...l agree to this marriage...

1940
02:03:27,084 --> 02:03:28,417
Jackie Shroff lookalike.

1941
02:03:28,584 --> 02:03:30,251
But I have a condition.

1942
02:03:30,792 --> 02:03:32,626
Is someone going to ask what?
- What?

1943
02:03:32,792 --> 02:03:34,751
The marriage takes
place in a church.

1944
02:03:34,876 --> 02:03:35,959
What are you saying?

1945
02:03:36,084 --> 02:03:38,167
Everyone agreed to Siddhu
and Jenny's marriage.

1946
02:03:38,459 --> 02:03:39,876
That's great news.

1947
02:03:40,084 --> 02:03:41,042
Their family said yes...

1948
02:03:41,126 --> 02:03:42,917
...I wonder when will
our family say yes.

1949
02:03:43,084 --> 02:03:45,459
Don't worry,
Veer...they will say yes.

1950
02:03:45,751 --> 02:03:47,626
Tell Siddhu we want a party.

1951
02:03:47,959 --> 02:03:51,542
Let's all meet and celebrate.
What say?

1952
02:03:51,626 --> 02:03:52,959
Yeah, okay. Cool
- Bye.

1953
02:03:56,084 --> 02:03:59,584
I told you...not to keep
any kind of relation with them.

1954
02:04:01,084 --> 02:04:02,251
Sis...

1955
02:04:04,626 --> 02:04:09,126
Sis...you've a problem
with that family. Not me.

1956
02:04:10,459 --> 02:04:14,334
And you're not telling
me what that problem is either.

1957
02:04:14,501 --> 02:04:17,876
I don't understand
why you're doing this, sis.

1958
02:04:21,917 --> 02:04:24,459
After mom and dad passed away...

1959
02:04:26,126 --> 02:04:29,959
...I've always fulfilled
all your wishes and wants

1960
02:04:32,292 --> 02:04:34,042
And never asked why.

1961
02:04:35,084 --> 02:04:37,626
I even let you take
your own decisions.

1962
02:04:39,417 --> 02:04:41,376
And never asked why.

1963
02:04:42,126 --> 02:04:47,792
So today, for the first time, when
I am stopping you from something...

1964
02:04:49,084 --> 02:04:51,251
...can't you do this much for me?

1965
02:04:54,292 --> 02:04:58,542
Fine, sis...I'll do everything you say.

1966
02:04:59,084 --> 02:05:01,626
I'll never ask anything, I promise.

1967
02:05:03,917 --> 02:05:05,709
But if not Veer...

1968
02:05:06,417 --> 02:05:09,251
...then there won't be
anyone else in my life.

1969
02:05:31,459 --> 02:05:32,417
Ishita...

1970
02:05:33,792 --> 02:05:35,334
Call Veer home tomorrow.

1971
02:05:36,501 --> 02:05:39,084
I want to talk to him.
- You mean...

1972
02:05:39,292 --> 02:05:41,209
Ask him to come alone.

1973
02:05:43,584 --> 02:05:45,542
Thank you, Pogo... Ma'am.

1974
02:05:45,626 --> 02:05:46,959
Sorry...!

1975
02:05:47,292 --> 02:05:50,376
Brother will be really
happy to know that you said yes.

1976
02:05:51,667 --> 02:05:53,417
But now you must accept
one of my condition!

1977
02:05:53,626 --> 02:05:54,167
Done.

1978
02:05:54,292 --> 02:05:55,417
I mean...whatever it is, I agree.

1979
02:05:55,584 --> 02:05:58,209
You can say it for formality,
but done.

1980
02:05:58,626 --> 02:06:01,042
After the marriage,
you must live here.

1981
02:06:05,459 --> 02:06:09,459
If you want to be with lshita...
you must leave your brother.

1982
02:06:12,626 --> 02:06:14,376
Sis...what are you saying?

1983
02:06:16,084 --> 02:06:18,042
Are you joking?

1984
02:06:25,667 --> 02:06:27,584
Ishu...this is a big issue.

1985
02:06:28,626 --> 02:06:30,834
Meera's asking me
to leave my brother.

1986
02:06:31,084 --> 02:06:34,917
See, I really love you...
but he isn't just my brother.

1987
02:06:35,126 --> 02:06:37,959
He's my father,
mother, friend...everything.

1988
02:06:38,626 --> 02:06:41,334
All his life he has only
cared about my happiness.

1989
02:06:41,501 --> 02:06:43,126
And she wants...

1990
02:06:48,459 --> 02:06:52,084
Sorry madam...you might
own a restaurant.

1991
02:06:52,209 --> 02:06:55,126
But this is not some
home-delivery or take-away.

1992
02:07:02,376 --> 02:07:03,834
Ishita, I am sorry.

1993
02:07:07,292 --> 02:07:10,084
But nothing is more
important than a brother.

1994
02:07:12,292 --> 02:07:13,417
Not even you.

1995
02:07:21,751 --> 02:07:22,459
Veer!

1996
02:07:25,959 --> 02:07:28,167
You're leaving her
for that brother of yours.

1997
02:07:28,459 --> 02:07:30,542
He isn't even your blood brother.

1998
02:07:34,209 --> 02:07:37,167
Your dad picked him
up from the streets.

1999
02:07:37,751 --> 02:07:39,084
Ishita...

2000
02:07:40,584 --> 02:07:43,334
You don't believe me.
Ask him yourself.

2001
02:07:43,459 --> 02:07:44,334
Enough!

2002
02:08:25,376 --> 02:08:26,459
Where were you Veer?

2003
02:08:26,584 --> 02:08:28,001
I've been asking around for you.

2004
02:08:28,126 --> 02:08:29,792
Come, let's eat...

2005
02:08:33,292 --> 02:08:34,459
What happened?

2006
02:08:37,792 --> 02:08:41,084
I wanted to ask you something.
- Ask. Why are you standing like that?

2007
02:08:41,376 --> 02:08:44,251
Is there something you've ever hidden
from me?

2008
02:08:44,792 --> 02:08:46,751
What could I ever hide from you?

2009
02:08:46,917 --> 02:08:50,417
No! There's nothing
I have hidden from you.

2010
02:08:51,084 --> 02:08:53,167
You're not my blood brother.

2011
02:09:02,084 --> 02:09:05,042
Who told you that?
- lshita's sister.

2012
02:09:08,626 --> 02:09:10,126
Why are you quiet?

2013
02:09:10,376 --> 02:09:13,167
Just tell me, you have my swear

2014
02:09:17,959 --> 02:09:20,084
It's true that I am not
your blood brother.

2015
02:09:24,792 --> 02:09:29,334
It's a different thing that
I love you more than a blood brother.

2016
02:09:31,292 --> 02:09:35,834
And it's true that
I hid this fact from you.

2017
02:09:36,751 --> 02:09:41,334
It's a different thing...
I didn't want to lose you.

2018
02:09:47,834 --> 02:09:50,709
Ishita's sister has a
condition for our marriage.

2019
02:09:51,584 --> 02:09:53,042
That I should leave you.

2020
02:09:57,917 --> 02:10:03,376
So...what did you say?

2021
02:10:04,459 --> 02:10:05,709
Get lost...

2022
02:10:06,334 --> 02:10:08,084
I left lshita, brother.

2023
02:10:11,917 --> 02:10:14,042
Brother...I'll find someone else.

2024
02:10:14,167 --> 02:10:17,209
But first I'll make sure that
she doesn't have an elder sister.

2025
02:10:22,584 --> 02:10:26,042
Don't forget to check.

2026
02:10:27,501 --> 02:10:28,626
Who knows...
I might have an affair...

2027
02:10:28,792 --> 02:10:31,084
...with every beautiful
girl's elder sister.

2028
02:10:40,459 --> 02:10:42,417
You bluntly said no?

2029
02:10:47,584 --> 02:10:49,042
Do you really love me so much?

2030
02:10:53,376 --> 02:10:55,751
Don't just stand there,
come here.

2031
02:11:19,501 --> 02:11:20,751
What did you want to do?

2032
02:11:21,167 --> 02:11:22,709
You wanted to separate two brothers.

2033
02:11:23,084 --> 02:11:24,542
Did it pain that much?

2034
02:11:24,917 --> 02:11:27,417
The very thought of separating
from your kin was painful.

2035
02:11:27,792 --> 02:11:31,792
Think about what I went
though...when you killed my dad.

2036
02:11:32,209 --> 02:11:33,417
Did you think about it..
- I didn't kill your dad.

2037
02:11:33,584 --> 02:11:35,376
You're lying.
- It's true!

2038
02:11:35,792 --> 02:11:37,542
It's true ! Look into my eyes.

2039
02:11:38,792 --> 02:11:42,417
I swear on my brother that
I didn't kill your father.

2040
02:11:42,792 --> 02:11:45,209
Look into my eyes Meera...
this is the truth.

2041
02:11:47,042 --> 02:11:49,126
We were the ones who were betrayed.

2042
02:11:49,376 --> 02:11:50,584
Us.

2043
02:11:51,459 --> 02:11:54,042
And if you still don't believe me,
then take this...

2044
02:11:54,292 --> 02:11:56,167
...and end this matter right now.

2045
02:11:56,542 --> 02:11:59,042
Shoot, Meera. Shoot.

2046
02:11:59,501 --> 02:12:01,792
I won't survive from
this close, Meera.

2047
02:12:01,959 --> 02:12:03,084
<i>Shoo“.</i>

2048
02:12:05,334 --> 02:12:06,126

Malik sir was the
one who betrayed them.

Whatever Kaali said is true.

2075
02:15:38,626 --> 02:15:41,334
Raghav, why didn't
you tell me this before?

2076
02:15:41,542 --> 02:15:44,001
I couldn't
go against Malik sir.

2077
02:15:45,042 --> 02:15:48,001
And I didn't want
a daughter to find out...

...what her father has done.

2079
02:15:54,626 --> 02:15:56,876
You don't know what you've done.

2080
02:15:58,751 --> 02:16:00,709
You don't know what you've done.

2081
02:16:25,417 --> 02:16:27,626
You love your brother a lot,
don't you?

2082
02:16:30,417 --> 02:16:31,042
Yes!

2083
02:16:32,626 --> 02:16:34,334
And my lshita too.

2084
02:16:36,251 --> 02:16:39,542
Then marry her and stay here.

2085
02:16:40,334 --> 02:16:42,251
With your brother.

2086
02:16:47,167 --> 02:16:48,209
What?

2087
02:16:48,584 --> 02:16:51,334
You mean...l won't die a bachelor.

2088
02:16:51,542 --> 02:16:53,251
I'll get married too.

2089
02:16:53,376 --> 02:16:55,667
I'll go on a honeymoon too.
- Veer.

2090
02:16:56,917 --> 02:16:59,334
I mean...would you like some tea.

2091
02:16:59,459 --> 02:17:00,626
You must have tea.

2092
02:17:00,792 --> 02:17:03,251
I suggest that you have
breakfast instead, Pogo.

2093
02:17:03,376 --> 02:17:05,251
Ishita, come.
We'll go to the kitchen and make tea.

2094
02:17:05,376 --> 02:17:06,209
Come...

2095
02:17:06,417 --> 02:17:07,751
Brother, don't just stand there...

2096
02:17:07,959 --> 02:17:09,584
Pogo's come home for the first time.

2097
02:17:09,709 --> 02:17:12,334
Show her the garage,
the house, the sofa...

2098
02:17:12,417 --> 02:17:13,542
Come on, brother.

2099
02:17:33,792 --> 02:17:34,959
Nice house.

2100
02:17:36,251 --> 02:17:37,209
It's new.

2101
02:17:39,959 --> 02:17:40,917
Thank you.

2102
02:17:48,876 --> 02:17:51,209
That's...our garage.

2103
02:17:52,042 --> 02:17:53,209
We modify car...

2104
02:17:53,292 --> 02:17:54,751
Designing... styling...

2105
02:17:55,292 --> 02:17:57,084
Fiber...the works...

2106
02:17:59,376 --> 02:18:01,626
You always loved cars.

2107
02:18:08,292 --> 02:18:09,709
That's Anwar and Shakti.

2108
02:18:10,209 --> 02:18:10,917
Remember?

2109
02:18:11,209 --> 02:18:12,459
Now they run a café.

2110
02:18:12,709 --> 02:18:14,709
Still multi-talented I guess.

2111
02:18:26,251 --> 02:18:28,709
Raghav told me the truth.

2112
02:18:31,959 --> 02:18:32,876
That's true.

2113
02:18:33,959 --> 02:18:38,459
You haven't changed at all.
- Except for a little beard.

2114
02:18:39,959 --> 02:18:41,709
Actually...you haven't changed either.

2115
02:18:42,626 --> 02:18:45,626
Maybe I've put on a little weight.
- Yes, a little...

2116
02:18:47,209 --> 02:18:49,167
I...l didn't mean that.

2117
02:18:49,376 --> 02:18:52,751
You...do look fine, same like before.

2118
02:18:52,959 --> 02:18:54,709
Really?
<i>"</i> No!

2119
02:18:56,542 --> 02:18:57,417
Only a little.

2120
02:18:59,751 --> 02:19:00,709
I am sorry.

2121
02:19:03,876 --> 02:19:05,376
It's been 15 years Kaali.

2122
02:19:10,209 --> 02:19:10,834
15 years...

2123
02:19:11,626 --> 02:19:12,751
4 months...

2124
02:19:13,417 --> 02:19:14,084
10 days!

2125
02:19:19,126 --> 02:19:20,876
The rest of the garage's ours too.

2126
02:19:21,001 --> 02:19:23,209
Engineering department...AutoCAD...

2127
02:19:23,417 --> 02:19:24,417
The whole...

2128
02:19:27,376 --> 02:19:28,876
I am so sorry!

2129
02:19:30,126 --> 02:19:31,459
I am so sorry!

2130
02:19:32,584 --> 02:19:35,709
I thought what I saw was the truth.

2131
02:19:36,501 --> 02:19:38,459
I didn't give you a chance to explain.

2132
02:19:39,542 --> 02:19:41,251
I didn't believe you.

2133
02:19:42,334 --> 02:19:44,167
I wanted to tell you, Meera.

2134
02:19:45,292 --> 02:19:47,459
But you were already gone. And...

2135
02:19:48,167 --> 02:19:49,084
I came here.

2136
02:19:49,959 --> 02:19:51,459
But you know what...

2137
02:19:52,292 --> 02:19:54,584
Let's forget all this now.

2138
02:19:55,084 --> 02:19:58,876
We...we don't need to look back now.

2139
02:19:59,209 --> 02:20:01,209
But it was entirely my fault.

2140
02:20:01,501 --> 02:20:02,709
I can't...

2141
02:20:03,084 --> 02:20:06,834
It wasn't your fault...nor mine.

2142
02:20:09,376 --> 02:20:10,834
The circumstances were to be blamed.

2143
02:20:17,084 --> 02:20:18,751
Meera, I...
- I

2144
02:20:27,751 --> 02:20:29,417
Good morning, Raj bhai.

2145
02:20:29,709 --> 02:20:31,959
Here comes the wedding
days...Kurkure and Lays (Wafers).

2146
02:20:32,084 --> 02:20:34,834
Come with me...
The wedding procession is coming.

2147
02:20:34,959 --> 02:20:36,751
Raj bhai, let's go.
- Where?

2148
02:20:36,959 --> 02:20:38,876
To make the wedding guest list.

2149
02:20:39,001 --> 02:20:41,626
If I make one, only thieves
and criminals will come.

2150
02:20:41,792 --> 02:20:44,376
And they'll even steal the cutlery.

2151
02:20:44,959 --> 02:20:48,209
Raj bhai...who is she?

2152
02:20:48,459 --> 02:20:49,751
Your wife?
- No..

2153
02:20:49,959 --> 02:20:51,709
No no, you're not married yet.

2154
02:20:51,876 --> 02:20:53,251
Your girlfriend.
- No...

2155
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:54,876
No...you don't have a girlfriend either.

2156
02:20:56,209 --> 02:20:57,042
What?

2157
02:20:57,209 --> 02:21:00,084
After seeing the wedding procession. Are you
dreaming of Becoming a groom as well.

2158
02:21:00,209 --> 02:21:02,584
What are you saying? What are you doing?
- Speak up naughty fellow.

2159
02:21:02,709 --> 02:21:04,084
Come on, let's go and talk there.

2160
02:21:04,459 --> 02:21:06,542
Okay.
By the way, I am Oscar.

2161
02:21:07,001 --> 02:21:09,209
What do I call her?
Can I call her sister-in-law?

2162
02:21:09,626 --> 02:21:14,542
"Walk with me...in every lifetime."

2163
02:21:14,959 --> 02:21:19,834
"Promise me...
you'll come back to me right here"

2164
02:21:20,209 --> 02:21:25,209
"We're one soul...
even if we're two bodies."

2165
02:21:25,959 --> 02:21:30,834
"Always be mine...
don't ever say goodbye."

2166
02:22:07,251 --> 02:22:08,209
Pogo, thank you.

2167
02:22:08,376 --> 02:22:09,959
Now even I can get
married because of you.

2168
02:22:10,084 --> 02:22:11,917
I did nothing.

2169
02:22:12,417 --> 02:22:14,334
When there's love...then
you should get married.

2170
02:22:14,417 --> 02:22:16,084
Then why didn't you get married yet.

2171
02:22:16,209 --> 02:22:19,042
There's a reason, I can't tell you.

2172
02:22:19,126 --> 02:22:20,584
But can I tell you something?

2173
02:22:20,751 --> 02:22:22,709
When I came here with
Siddhu to book this place...

2174
02:22:22,959 --> 02:22:24,459
...I got a wonderful news.

2175
02:22:24,584 --> 02:22:28,459
Even if you hold two weddings here,
the price of the hall is still same.

2176
02:22:28,584 --> 02:22:32,834
And...the expenses for decorator
and caterer is also the same.

2177
02:22:33,126 --> 02:22:34,459
Very enticing.

2178
02:22:34,959 --> 02:22:36,417
But tell me one thing...

2179
02:22:36,876 --> 02:22:40,334
Does my face tell you I am a miser?

2180
02:22:40,584 --> 02:22:41,542
No.

2181
02:22:41,709 --> 02:22:43,376
That's not it.

2182
02:22:43,459 --> 02:22:45,417
But there has to be some excuse...

2183
02:22:45,709 --> 02:22:46,959
...to take things forward.

2184
02:23:02,334 --> 02:23:03,292
Look.

2185
02:23:04,167 --> 02:23:05,792
They look so happy.

2186
02:23:06,584 --> 02:23:08,042
Yes, they are.

2187
02:23:08,542 --> 02:23:11,292
Soon Ishita and Veer
will get married too.

2188
02:23:11,876 --> 02:23:13,542
You will miss lshita a lot.

2189
02:23:13,667 --> 02:23:14,292
A lot.

2190
02:23:14,459 --> 02:23:17,001
Actually you can come
home everyday to meet lshita.

2191
02:23:17,292 --> 02:23:20,167
In fact, I can even
pick you up from the shack.

2192
02:23:20,709 --> 02:23:22,542
You can have dinner with us.

2193
02:23:22,667 --> 02:23:25,001
Nowadays I even cook well.

2194
02:23:25,292 --> 02:23:26,292
Really?
- Really.

2195
02:23:26,417 --> 02:23:30,709
So taxi, catering,
escort service...whatever.

2196
02:23:31,084 --> 02:23:32,001
Wow!

2197
02:23:35,292 --> 02:23:39,459
But...pickup and drop every day.

2198
02:23:41,751 --> 02:23:45,001
I must think of another
way to meet lshita every day.

2199
02:23:45,959 --> 02:23:48,334
Actually, I do have a way.

2200
02:23:49,209 --> 02:23:50,292
What?

2201
02:23:52,959 --> 02:23:55,709
Can you meet me for
five minutes tomorrow?

2202
02:23:56,667 --> 02:23:57,667
Huh?

2203
02:24:10,459 --> 02:24:11,917
I'll think about it.

2204
02:24:31,251 --> 02:24:33,042
This is my car.

2205
02:24:33,334 --> 02:24:34,459
Open the boot!

2206
02:24:37,876 --> 02:24:43,834
Joshua...who is the man here,
claiming this car to be his car?

2207
02:24:44,959 --> 02:24:45,917
You.

2208
02:24:47,751 --> 02:24:49,834
You only said it...

2209
02:24:50,167 --> 02:24:53,501
Go and bring that guy.

2210
02:24:53,667 --> 02:24:54,376
Yes, sir.

2211
02:24:54,584 --> 02:24:57,417
Whiter than white...
that's Oscar family.

2212
02:24:57,584 --> 02:25:00,042
Where are you taking me?
Is there less salt in the food.

2213
02:25:02,209 --> 02:25:03,542
Hail Mother Mary.

2214
02:25:04,876 --> 02:25:06,042
When asked,
He said that he owns the car.

2215
02:25:06,209 --> 02:25:07,042
Yeah...

2216
02:25:07,209 --> 02:25:09,417
When the dog's about the die...

2217
02:25:09,751 --> 02:25:13,542
...the Thakur's manager says,
"Thakur's dead".

2218
02:25:13,709 --> 02:25:15,334
That's nothing original.

2219
02:25:15,501 --> 02:25:17,667
It's a dialogue from
Karan-Arjun (Bollywood film).

2220
02:25:17,834 --> 02:25:20,667
Maybe you don't know who I am.

2221
02:25:20,959 --> 02:25:22,542
I am King. King.

2222
02:25:22,709 --> 02:25:26,167
So do you want me to make your
adhaar card, son of burger king.

2223
02:25:26,376 --> 02:25:27,251
This car...

2224
02:25:27,459 --> 02:25:31,959
Don't even dream about this car.

2225
02:25:32,042 --> 02:25:34,251
I won't sell it at any cost.

2226
02:25:34,501 --> 02:25:38,834
And anyway, Oscar never
deals with the likes of you.

2227
02:25:39,001 --> 02:25:40,459
Have your food and leave quietly.

2228
02:25:41,209 --> 02:25:44,501
Forgive me...it's not my fault.

2229
02:25:44,709 --> 02:25:47,626
Mani stole this car
and brought it to me.

2230
02:25:55,542 --> 02:25:57,834
When the dog's about the die...

2231
02:25:58,042 --> 02:26:02,501
...the neighboring puppy
eyes his young widow.

2232
02:26:02,709 --> 02:26:04,042
How nice, sir...

2233
02:26:04,334 --> 02:26:06,876
Neighboring puppy...
young widow

2234
02:26:07,084 --> 02:26:08,834
What a message.

2235
02:26:10,042 --> 02:26:11,126
Where's everyone?

2236
02:26:11,209 --> 02:26:13,209
Hello...one, two, three, four...

2237
02:26:13,584 --> 02:26:15,542
Widow... puppy..-

2238
02:26:15,709 --> 02:26:17,417
Everyone's right here, Mani.

2239
02:26:17,584 --> 02:26:21,001
Just that...my right and your
left indicator is switched on, son

2240
02:26:21,084 --> 02:26:26,001
Mani...there were drugs
worth millions in the boot!

2241
02:26:26,709 --> 02:26:31,292
Veer found those packets.
I don't know what he did with it.

2242
02:26:31,459 --> 02:26:33,834
Ask him and he'll tell you.

2243
02:26:34,042 --> 02:26:35,334
Hello.

2244
02:26:35,834 --> 02:26:37,626
Get Veer!

2245
02:26:39,084 --> 02:26:40,501
What's all this, King?

2246
02:26:40,709 --> 02:26:42,417
Why bring me here like this?

2247
02:26:43,001 --> 02:26:46,042
When the dog's about the die...

2248
02:26:48,834 --> 02:26:51,001
Joshua, I am out of stock.
Have you got anything?

2249
02:26:51,167 --> 02:26:53,001
I have with a cat.
- Shut up!

2250
02:26:53,709 --> 02:26:56,792
Mani bhai. Oscar bhai, why are you both
looking in the opposite directions?

2251
02:26:56,959 --> 02:26:58,042
Are you angry with each other?

2252
02:26:58,167 --> 02:27:00,042
No, they were being stiff with me.

2253
02:27:00,209 --> 02:27:02,209
So...l stiffened their neck.

2254
02:27:02,376 --> 02:27:04,167
King, you're crossing your limits.

2255
02:27:04,292 --> 02:27:05,501
I am.

2256
02:27:05,959 --> 02:27:08,167
Because back in college...

2257
02:27:08,959 --> 02:27:11,542
...Seema and Rekha didn't
let me cross my limits.

2258
02:27:11,917 --> 02:27:14,667
It happens with everyone, King.
Don't get emotional.

2259
02:27:14,876 --> 02:27:17,834
What did you do with my drugs, Veer?

2260
02:27:18,501 --> 02:27:20,042
Whatever I did,
you were involved in it too?

2261
02:27:20,209 --> 02:27:20,834
Meaning?

2262
02:27:21,001 --> 02:27:25,001
Your drugs were burning
in the same bonfire...

2263
02:27:25,084 --> 02:27:27,709
...where you were keeping
your hands warm.

2264
02:27:28,001 --> 02:27:31,834
I kept asking you
"Was there something in the car".

2265
02:27:32,042 --> 02:27:34,042
Hello, One, two, three, four...

2266
02:27:34,209 --> 02:27:38,001
Are you crazy?
You burned away drugs worth millions.

2267
02:27:51,542 --> 02:27:53,334
Veer. Veer.

2268
02:27:59,334 --> 02:28:00,417
Kaali!

2269
02:30:13,334 --> 02:30:15,209
We know the truth, sis.

2270
02:30:15,501 --> 02:30:17,167
Brother told us everything.

2271
02:30:17,376 --> 02:30:18,626
Don't worry.

2272
02:30:18,876 --> 02:30:21,167
Yeah...you were right
and brother was wrong.

2273
02:30:21,376 --> 02:30:22,876
You left him because...

2274
02:30:23,042 --> 02:30:26,459
...brother turned from washer man Ramlal
into Kaali for money.

2275
02:30:27,292 --> 02:30:30,042
And you didn't want his
bad influence on my upbringing.

2276
02:30:30,209 --> 02:30:31,167
So you...

2277
02:30:31,292 --> 02:30:33,667
Pogo, please rest. Would
you like some juice? I'll go get it.

2278
02:30:33,834 --> 02:30:35,126
Have an apple too.
Come lshu come.

2279
02:30:35,542 --> 02:30:37,126
Brother..
- Yeah...got it.

2280
02:30:40,501 --> 02:30:42,459
Why didn't you tell them the truth?

2281
02:30:43,376 --> 02:30:45,126
Because we shouldn't
tell them in the first place.

2282
02:30:45,209 --> 02:30:46,501
What's the point, Meera?

2283
02:30:46,584 --> 02:30:48,251
The enmity between our dads...

2284
02:30:48,376 --> 02:30:51,126
Killing each other... Why?

2285
02:30:52,209 --> 02:30:55,126
Actually,
we should all start afresh.

2286
02:30:55,459 --> 02:30:58,417
And no one needs to look back.

2287
02:31:00,709 --> 02:31:03,876
But why did you prove yourself wrong,
and me right?

2288
02:31:08,959 --> 02:31:10,376
You see...

2289
02:31:11,834 --> 02:31:15,792
In big countries...
these small things often happen...

2290
02:31:16,376 --> 02:31:17,792
Senorita.

2291
02:31:53,459 --> 02:31:56,501
"It's the night to celebrate."

2292
02:31:57,001 --> 02:32:00,042
"it's the night to celebrate."

2293
02:32:00,334 --> 02:32:03,417
"Sway to the beat,
O my tormentor."

2294
02:32:10,876 --> 02:32:14,209
"Your mischief lights up the place."

2295
02:32:14,334 --> 02:32:17,459
"You went crazy, and I got attitude."

2296
02:32:17,584 --> 02:32:20,876
"Let the world be jealous."

2297
02:32:21,167 --> 02:32:24,209
"Let the world be jealous."

2298
02:32:24,542 --> 02:32:27,667
"And the beloved dances
all night with her sweetheart."

2299
02:32:42,126 --> 02:32:45,417
"Life is like a saga."

2300
02:32:45,584 --> 02:32:48,834
"The style of big-hearted people."

2301
02:32:49,042 --> 02:32:54,959
"When I grab the opportunity."

2302
02:32:55,709 --> 02:32:59,042
"The way to live freely."

2303
02:32:59,334 --> 02:33:02,626
"Learn this method from us."

2304
02:33:02,751 --> 02:33:08,709
"We have all the fun in a moment."

2305
02:33:10,001 --> 02:33:12,959
"Come and have fun with us."

2306
02:33:13,459 --> 02:33:16,792
"Come and have fun with us."

2307
02:33:16,917 --> 02:33:20,209
"Or just stay away
and watch us have fun."
