1
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,924
Dostoevsky was held captive

2
00:00:14,044 --> 00:00:16,725
in a rat-infested fortress,

3
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:19,605
subjected to a mock execution,

4
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,486
shipped off to a brutal
prison camp in Siberia

5
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:25,086
with a sadistic maniac
in charge,

6
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:30,327
who lashed men for sleeping
on their wrong side in bed.

7
00:00:31,688 --> 00:00:33,688
There's a correct side?

8
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:38,809
Apparently,
Jesus slept on his left.

9
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,450
Is it helping?

10
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,531
Not being Dostoevsky?

11
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:50,852
Yes.

12
00:00:51,412 --> 00:00:52,572
Cool.

13
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:57,653
Are you going to bed now?

14
00:00:57,733 --> 00:00:58,829
- It's only...
- It doesn't make

15
00:00:58,853 --> 00:01:00,854
much difference,
to be honest.

16
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:03,374
Okay.

17
00:01:03,454 --> 00:01:05,494
- See you later.
- Mm.

18
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:26,139
As government sources
dismiss press reports

19
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,579
of Robert Sutherland
being burnt out,

20
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:30,860
the Prime Minister
abandoned a press conference

21
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,780
at number 10,
Downing Street.

22
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,780
They say he's been suffering
from dizziness,

23
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:38,021
after a minor illness.

24
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:49,463
We believe that
the Cerberus code,

25
00:01:49,503 --> 00:01:53,024
is part of a massive,
critical, infrastructure hit,

26
00:01:53,144 --> 00:01:56,465
of which the water supply
in Kent was just a starter.

27
00:01:56,505 --> 00:01:59,105
It might come all at once,
or in waves.

28
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:00,785
But we do know it's massive.

29
00:02:02,146 --> 00:02:03,626
So, we don't know

30
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:07,867
if Cerberus is the Chinese,
or the Russians.

31
00:02:07,987 --> 00:02:10,908
Well, like our own tax
on the Iranians,

32
00:02:11,028 --> 00:02:13,588
it could easily
be a joint enterprise.

33
00:02:13,628 --> 00:02:16,909
There are no identifiable
command callbacks

34
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:18,309
that we can find in the code.

35
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:20,629
Now, normally,
a virus would need

36
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:22,590
to refer back to a controller,

37
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,191
who might tell it to start,
stop, destroy yourself.

38
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:27,591
But here, there's nothing.

39
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:30,031
There may be no way
of stopping it now.

40
00:02:31,312 --> 00:02:33,072
- Fraser.
- Sir. We've ranked targets

41
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:35,873
of the general critical
infrastructure attack

42
00:02:35,913 --> 00:02:38,993
into a "Top 5,"
but it's not exhaustive.

43
00:02:40,353 --> 00:02:45,034
One, a few,
or all of these.

44
00:02:45,074 --> 00:02:47,155
We can't sit around
and do nothing.

45
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:48,595
They could bring down planes,

46
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,275
black out the entire country,

47
00:02:50,315 --> 00:02:51,916
cripple the water supply.

48
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:54,156
They've already
had a good go at that.

49
00:02:56,037 --> 00:03:00,037
How do we end this
in a face-saving way?

50
00:03:00,157 --> 00:03:02,318
Increase our retaliations.

51
00:03:02,358 --> 00:03:04,158
See, that is not going to work...

52
00:03:04,198 --> 00:03:07,719
Division 45 was created
precisely for that reason, wasn't it?

53
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,039
We've boasted
about our offensive capacities.

54
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,640
The Americans
have made it very clear

55
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,160
that they are
not going to help us.

56
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,760
So, we do it
without them.

57
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,577
Well, I have to admit,
when I was Home Secretary,

58
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:19,481
I'd always have a bit
of a snooze

59
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:22,922
when people banged on about
the danger of cyber-attacks.

60
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:26,763
Sorry,
is it a time for joking?

61
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:35,604
Um, in all fairness...

62
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:39,085
I do not need a translation
service, thank you.

63
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:42,886
I've already sacked one traitor.

64
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:45,846
- Anyone else considering acts of disloyalty...
- Piffle!

65
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:49,327
Anna Marshall wasn't disloyal.

66
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:52,008
That's a categoric error,
Robert,

67
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:54,568
which is frankly,
rather disappointing,

68
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:56,889
from a man who never tires
of reminding us

69
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:00,009
that he studied
philosophy at Balliol.

70
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:02,650
And don't give me
the Scottish stare either,

71
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,330
you're from Stirling,

72
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,331
not Drumchapel!

73
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:10,491
I think it's a matter of record,

74
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:13,412
I never saw eye-to-eye
with Anna Marshall.

75
00:04:13,492 --> 00:04:16,493
She's the kind of
ghastly liberal snob

76
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:19,413
who thinks her cleaning lady
is a loyal friend,

77
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:22,654
rather than
a reluctant wage slave.

78
00:04:23,974 --> 00:04:26,335
Misplaced loyalty, yes.

79
00:04:26,415 --> 00:04:31,096
Unbearably sanctimonious,
Christ, yes!

80
00:04:31,176 --> 00:04:33,656
But she was never disloyal!

81
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:35,416
I'm afraid,
Prime Minister,

82
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:38,737
I'd have to agree with the
Foreign Secretary on that one.

83
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:44,098
The loyalty bit, anyway,
not the cleaning ladies.

84
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,099
For what it's worth.

85
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:49,659
Well, let me enlighten you
on that, Fraser.

86
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,540
It's worth nothing!

87
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,341
It looks as if all that's left
is to banish Kent to France.

88
00:05:02,982 --> 00:05:04,542
Get a grip, man!

89
00:05:23,986 --> 00:05:26,107
He's losing it.

90
00:05:26,187 --> 00:05:27,907
- You went in too hard.
- Bugger that!

91
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:30,547
He's the bloody
Prime Minister!

92
00:05:30,627 --> 00:05:34,628
If he can't cut it, he should
make way for somebody who can.

93
00:05:36,989 --> 00:05:39,429
Well,
as Home Secretary,

94
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:42,430
I shall continue
to chair the meeting.

95
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,190
Protocol suggests
you are correct.

96
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,992
Right, our top priority...

97
00:06:10,115 --> 00:06:12,236
Come to tell me
you agree with them all?

98
00:06:12,316 --> 00:06:13,516
No.

99
00:06:14,436 --> 00:06:15,636
Good.

100
00:06:17,437 --> 00:06:19,557
I need time to find
a replacement for Fraser.

101
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:22,438
You're not going to fire Fraser.

102
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,680
High Chaparral?

103
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,521
You remember it?

104
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:39,441
Linda Cristal
played Victoria Cannon.

105
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:41,122
You're my new Chief of Staff.

106
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:42,882
No, thanks.

107
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:47,883
Maybe I should
re-appoint Peter Mott,

108
00:06:47,923 --> 00:06:51,684
just to play pointless games
of one-upmanship with Archie.

109
00:06:53,004 --> 00:06:55,764
Tale told by an idiot,
all right.

110
00:06:55,804 --> 00:06:58,685
You're angry because Archie
kicked your ass for a change,

111
00:06:58,765 --> 00:07:01,886
and I understand
how that must hurt.

112
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:06,527
But I'm not here for
chit-chats, or quotations,

113
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:09,567
my job is strictly
national security.

114
00:07:09,647 --> 00:07:11,768
Would you like me to
update you on our strategy?

115
00:07:11,888 --> 00:07:13,568
Oh, we have a strategy, okay.

116
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:15,929
You have instructed me
to be proactive.

117
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,210
Yeah, sorry, yeah.

118
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,330
Yeah.

119
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,771
Just not used to people carrying
out my instructions anymore.

120
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:35,452
Heracles killed Cerberus.

121
00:07:36,893 --> 00:07:38,893
Now, we can run around
trying to protect everything

122
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:42,134
from power stations
to air traffic control centers.

123
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:45,534
But in the end, it's like
chasing 100 cats at once.

124
00:07:46,655 --> 00:07:49,215
If you do want to up the ante,

125
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:51,936
don't bother with
any more symbolic targets.

126
00:07:52,896 --> 00:07:55,336
You have to play very dirty.

127
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:56,377
With what?

128
00:07:56,457 --> 00:07:58,137
With Heracles.

129
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:02,018
You know...

130
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:04,578
characters from Greek mythology
are all very well and good

131
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:07,379
when it comes to scary
operational names, but...

132
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:09,579
It's a bit more than that.

133
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:14,900
It's malware designed to confuse and disable
missile defense systems around the world.

134
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,141
Cyber war works like
any other war.

135
00:08:17,221 --> 00:08:20,221
It escalates very fast.

136
00:08:20,261 --> 00:08:23,022
If the attack vectors
aren't controlled properly,

137
00:08:23,142 --> 00:08:26,343
or if it extends beyond
the prime target,

138
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:30,023
this war could escalate in
ways we can no longer contain.

139
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:46,307
Senior cabinet sources have muttered about
instability within the Sutherland cabinet

140
00:08:46,387 --> 00:08:50,267
after the rumored sacking of his
closest advisor, Anna Marshall.

141
00:08:50,307 --> 00:08:53,028
This has still not been
confirmed by Downing Street.

142
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:56,909
Meanwhile, here in Kent, the
election remains on a knife edge

143
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:59,789
as Francine Bridge
accuses her Tory opponent

144
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:02,390
of trying to stoke
a fake culture war,

145
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,191
and Rodger Hawkins continues to flirt
with the Firestorm conspiracy website.

146
00:09:07,271 --> 00:09:08,911
Back to you in the studio.

147
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:11,672
It's all gotten very ugly.
Look.

148
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:18,433
Hawkins put this in?

149
00:09:18,553 --> 00:09:19,769
I don't know
if he printed them,

150
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,234
but his people
are distributing them.

151
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:23,154
Right, well, I'll speak
to his people, then,

152
00:09:23,194 --> 00:09:24,770
'cause I can't believe they'll
sanction this kind of stuff.

153
00:09:24,794 --> 00:09:27,675
I can! It's more siren now
than dog-whistle.

154
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:38,517
What's happening
with Anna Marshall?

155
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:40,677
She resigned.

156
00:09:41,558 --> 00:09:43,518
I heard she'd been fired.

157
00:09:43,558 --> 00:09:45,318
- She resigned.
- Right.

158
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,879
The police have been in
touch with me about security.

159
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,320
Right.
How many is it this time?

160
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,680
Rape, or death, or both.

161
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,881
God!

162
00:09:57,761 --> 00:09:59,041
217.

163
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:01,682
Four credible.
One very credible.

164
00:10:02,682 --> 00:10:04,322
A group calling themselves
J 23,

165
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:07,683
formed out of the remnants
of national spirit, have sworn

166
00:10:07,803 --> 00:10:10,083
to prevent Kent
from having a black MP.

167
00:10:10,163 --> 00:10:12,044
Of course,
they didn't actually say black.

168
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:16,765
I can't stay at home
while I'm in London.

169
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:18,885
No, sure, sure,
we'll get you a flat.

170
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:20,445
I'm going to stay with Anna.

171
00:10:20,565 --> 00:10:22,766
It's two hours' drive
from the constituency.

172
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:24,806
Yeah, but what about the press?

173
00:10:24,926 --> 00:10:28,567
I mean, I think we've got bigger
things to worry about, don't you?

174
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:41,570
Your destination
is 1.5 miles away.

175
00:10:53,572 --> 00:10:56,653
At the next junction,
turn right.

176
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:01,814
Turn right.

177
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,660
You all right?

178
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,061
It's a one-way street, love.

179
00:11:37,181 --> 00:11:39,421
You can't be turning the wrong
way down a one-way street.

180
00:11:43,062 --> 00:11:44,582
Yeah, I know.

181
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,703
Well, why did you, then?

182
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:49,583
My SatNav.
It told me...

183
00:11:49,703 --> 00:11:51,224
Hang on,
I know you!

184
00:11:53,104 --> 00:11:56,945
Now hold on,
could I get a selfie?

185
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:58,585
Oh no, no!

186
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,347
- Hiya.
- You all right, madam?

187
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:08,187
No, I've had an accident.

188
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:14,948
Highways England has
issued an urgent traffic alert,

189
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,229
warning drivers
that accidents are occurring,

190
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:19,949
due to faulty motorway
ENS SatNav data.

191
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:25,070
Motorists are urged not to begin
any journey by road, until further notice.

192
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,671
- So it's started.
- It's bloody mayhem out there.

193
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:35,112
What's happening?

194
00:12:35,192 --> 00:12:36,809
They've attacked
the traffic control system,

195
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,353
including SatNav apps.

196
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:39,809
People are getting
a ton of misinformation.

197
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,834
There are accidents
across the major cities.

198
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:43,714
Also, the motorways
are gridlocked.

199
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:46,715
They've put up fake speed
warning signs of 30 miles per hour.

200
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:50,115
That's about normal
for the M25, isn't it?

201
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:52,916
- Funny if you're getting cut out of your car.
- What?

202
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,676
- Who are you?
- I'm Audrey Hem...

203
00:12:55,716 --> 00:12:57,917
No, I don't actually care
who you are.

204
00:12:57,957 --> 00:12:59,957
She works with me,
leave her alone.

205
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:03,718
Carry on then.

206
00:13:05,598 --> 00:13:09,839
Traffic lights, control centers,
SatNavs, the works.

207
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,440
- We need to prioritize the motorways.
- Agreed.

208
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,200
But who knows
what they'll target next?

209
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,441
In some places, the
tailbacks are already so bad,

210
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:20,201
that we are going to have to
organize emergency relief deliveries.

211
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:23,482
Also, this.

212
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,962
Firestorm symbols
are everywhere.

213
00:13:31,084 --> 00:13:34,684
- Where's the PM?
- I don't know. He was informed, so...

214
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,365
- We need to act!
- I know!

215
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,446
So...

216
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:44,486
are you going to
get the ball rolling?

217
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:47,567
I am.

218
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:54,688
I thought he was
going to shoot me, Anna.

219
00:13:55,688 --> 00:13:56,969
I'm surprised.

220
00:13:57,729 --> 00:13:59,729
He just took a photo.

221
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,970
Till that moment, all
the threats had just felt,

222
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,450
a bit unreal.

223
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:13,692
Apparently, all the
navigation apps are buggered.

224
00:14:15,252 --> 00:14:16,973
They're driving into rivers,

225
00:14:17,093 --> 00:14:19,093
and the wrong way down
motorway slip roads.

226
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:20,973
I almost did that once,
actually.

227
00:14:21,054 --> 00:14:22,574
One of those mad
loopy junctions

228
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:24,694
with an Aldi and with
a Frankie and Benny's.

229
00:14:29,575 --> 00:14:31,856
Is that one of ours?

230
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,217
- I've never seen that.
- Has he?

231
00:14:37,257 --> 00:14:39,977
I don't think so.
Even Robert...

232
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,819
- Obviously, it has to be you.
- Obviously!

233
00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:50,739
This is in
the national interest.

234
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:52,820
We can't have
an absentee Prime Minister.

235
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,140
100 percent agreed, Joseph.

236
00:15:01,262 --> 00:15:03,702
Tell me something
I already know.

237
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:05,222
He's using you
as a stalking horse,

238
00:15:05,262 --> 00:15:07,103
and then he'll step over
your twitching corpse.

239
00:15:07,223 --> 00:15:08,823
The long and
the short of it, Motty.

240
00:15:08,863 --> 00:15:11,224
I wish you'd stop
calling me Motty.

241
00:15:13,464 --> 00:15:15,984
Joseph Obasi is
not an enigma at all.

242
00:15:16,105 --> 00:15:18,625
He's simply a man
who has one thing,

243
00:15:18,745 --> 00:15:20,625
and one thing only,
on his mind.

244
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:23,226
- Nothing wrong with that.
- Nothing wrong with it at all.

245
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:24,866
I'm all in favor of ambition.

246
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:27,987
- He's allowed to be ambitious.
- Very liberal of you, Archie.

247
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:31,868
And he's right, we can't have
an absentee Prime Minister.

248
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:37,629
Okay, you go and find a
peasant girl with a low bodice,

249
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:39,349
and an inviting neck.

250
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:40,989
I've got some thinking to do.

251
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:55,712
My President is rather busy with
events in the South China Sea.

252
00:15:55,752 --> 00:15:57,353
And if we deploy Heracles,

253
00:15:57,473 --> 00:16:00,113
how do you think that'll
affect his job done there?

254
00:16:00,153 --> 00:16:02,154
Don't do it.

255
00:16:02,234 --> 00:16:03,994
We have no choice.

256
00:16:04,114 --> 00:16:07,635
We would find a move
like that very concerning.

257
00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:10,235
Not as concerning
as we found it

258
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:14,076
when a substantial part of
the North Sea landed on Kent.

259
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:19,957
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.

260
00:16:19,997 --> 00:16:23,398
You don't like it when I
mention that little gaffe, do you?

261
00:16:23,478 --> 00:16:25,518
I'll speak to the President,
again.

262
00:16:25,638 --> 00:16:28,239
Make sure he understands
exactly what's at stake?

263
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,120
People won't be happy.

264
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,361
Happiness is overrated.

265
00:16:47,963 --> 00:16:49,243
Quick word.

266
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:52,884
Are you prepared for this?

267
00:16:54,284 --> 00:16:56,125
Yeah.

268
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:59,285
'Cause, uh, we may have
to go right to the brink.

269
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:02,686
And cold wars can very
easily become hot ones.

270
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:09,207
Is it three hours or five?

271
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:12,568
- Is what?
- The time difference with Santiago.

272
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,889
Five.

273
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,849
And the clocks go forward.

274
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:33,172
- He's going downhill.
- Obasi's on maneuvers.

275
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:36,053
- What, he's the one leaking on Robert?
- I know!

276
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:38,413
Robert thinks it's me.

277
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:40,973
His head's not with us.

278
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:44,454
We can't survive this
if he's not on top of his game.

279
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:47,695
He can't even sort out
this shitshow in Kent.

280
00:17:47,815 --> 00:17:51,416
Obasi can sort out Kent,
he's had enough of Hawkins.

281
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:53,656
I'm off to Pixie Hollow.

282
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,660
Good morning, Anna!

283
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,141
May I come in?

284
00:18:24,342 --> 00:18:25,902
You don't like me, Anna.

285
00:18:26,703 --> 00:18:28,423
That's not exactly true.

286
00:18:28,543 --> 00:18:30,423
I know what you're
going to say, and I get it.

287
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,344
I'm not everybody's cappuccino.

288
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:35,904
I was going to say, "That's
not exactly true, I detest you."

289
00:18:37,545 --> 00:18:38,905
Good.

290
00:18:40,705 --> 00:18:42,866
But that loathing,

291
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:47,347
which I assure you,
is entirely mutual,

292
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:52,068
shouldn't be based
on incorrect assumptions.

293
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:56,309
One of which is,
that my self-deprecating humor

294
00:18:56,389 --> 00:18:58,629
betrays a lack of seriousness.

295
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:01,590
The other assumption is that
I don't care about my country.

296
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,550
- Not true.
- Get on with it, you vile old crook.

297
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:12,672
Robert's in a bad place.

298
00:19:12,712 --> 00:19:14,072
Since your departure,

299
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:17,913
the cyber threat to our
nation has intensified.

300
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:22,154
You have to come back.

301
00:19:27,155 --> 00:19:28,195
I can't.

302
00:19:28,315 --> 00:19:31,196
If you don't,
Abassey will move,

303
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:33,716
and I'll be forced
to move with him.

304
00:19:33,836 --> 00:19:35,836
You don't want to move?

305
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:42,238
Who knows Robert best?

306
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:45,758
- In politics, I mean.
- Me.

307
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,599
You.

308
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:51,160
And after you?

309
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,441
Okay.

310
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:59,321
Go and talk to him.

311
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:02,242
- He won't see me.
- He'll see you.

312
00:20:06,923 --> 00:20:09,683
Do you think it was easy
for me to come here?

313
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:15,924
What's that old Nazi doing here?

314
00:20:17,565 --> 00:20:21,166
Just planning a bit of genocide.

315
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:29,007
Rude millennials,
first on ze list, I'm afraid.

316
00:20:30,447 --> 00:20:32,728
Carry on clicking, comrade.

317
00:20:33,928 --> 00:20:37,169
Change.org will come.

318
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,970
It's a critical situation, Anna.

319
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:56,413
Earlier,
I spoke to Francine Bridge

320
00:20:56,453 --> 00:20:57,733
about a controversial leaflet

321
00:20:57,853 --> 00:20:59,453
circulating
in her constituency.

322
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:00,933
I have never suggested

323
00:21:00,973 --> 00:21:02,894
that Kent should pay
reparations for slavery.

324
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:04,494
It's an absurd invention,

325
00:21:04,614 --> 00:21:06,391
which is being used by
a renegade Tory candidate

326
00:21:06,415 --> 00:21:08,935
who is clearly allowing himself
to be used by the same forces

327
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:10,375
who were behind Firestorm.

328
00:21:10,415 --> 00:21:11,736
And who
do you think that is?

329
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:12,896
I have no idea!

330
00:21:12,936 --> 00:21:14,896
- Good to see you, Joseph!
- Yes.

331
00:21:14,936 --> 00:21:16,697
Let me show you the, um...

332
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,617
You're doing
door-to-door canvassing

333
00:21:18,697 --> 00:21:21,017
in the middle of town
and surrounding areas?

334
00:21:21,138 --> 00:21:23,098
That's right,
the less traditional areas.

335
00:21:23,178 --> 00:21:24,738
Traditional? Right.

336
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:26,979
And what campaign material
are you using?

337
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:30,419
Err, the leaflets
have a new batch.

338
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:32,100
No, that's not one of ours.

339
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,620
- Whose is this?
- Err, independent guess...

340
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,581
- Have your team handed any out?
- Not to the best of my knowledge.

341
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:45,142
Rodger, its a moot point whether
you're a Russian or just a useful idiot.

342
00:21:45,182 --> 00:21:49,623
- Yet, I've supported you when others have not.
- I know, I know!

343
00:21:49,703 --> 00:21:54,464
But you seem to be under a
misconception, which is sadly common,

344
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:59,265
that I will dismiss any allegations
of racism as political correctness.

345
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:03,266
Or that I think that there's no such
thing as structural discrimination.

346
00:22:04,626 --> 00:22:07,707
For the record,
neither are true.

347
00:22:07,787 --> 00:22:10,187
Okay look,
the very fact that you're here...

348
00:22:10,227 --> 00:22:14,348
The very fact that I'm here,
proves that one of the holders,

349
00:22:14,428 --> 00:22:17,509
of the three great offices
of state has come to visit.

350
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,389
So, show some damn respect!

351
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:22,790
Respect works both ways, Joseph.

352
00:22:30,271 --> 00:22:33,952
On reflection, I think it would
be better if I returned to London,

353
00:22:33,992 --> 00:22:37,393
and informed the Prime Minister
of what I've found here.

354
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:39,193
Yeah, send him.
Send him!

355
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:43,194
Send Archie! Send
Malcolm X, if you want.

356
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:47,755
He's unavailable. Due to
being dead, you total chump!

357
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,715
Because I'm going to win
this election,

358
00:22:49,755 --> 00:22:52,716
with or without the support
of the leadership,

359
00:22:52,796 --> 00:22:55,436
who no longer represent
true conservatism,

360
00:22:55,476 --> 00:23:00,157
and takes the knee to
George Soros and the like.

361
00:23:00,877 --> 00:23:02,198
And the like?

362
00:23:03,438 --> 00:23:05,038
Of course.

363
00:23:05,158 --> 00:23:07,999
Full house, Rodger.
I've seen enough.

364
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,961
If we suspend him now...

365
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:18,441
We don't have a candidate.

366
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:19,641
If I were a betting man...

367
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:21,282
- Which you are.
- Which I am.

368
00:23:21,402 --> 00:23:23,722
I would expect Firestorm
to support him now.

369
00:23:23,762 --> 00:23:24,962
It's a perfect outcome.

370
00:23:25,002 --> 00:23:26,203
One they possibly planned.

371
00:23:26,243 --> 00:23:27,963
If we suspend him,

372
00:23:28,043 --> 00:23:30,723
- doesn't that increase his chances of winning?
- Yes.

373
00:23:30,803 --> 00:23:32,740
And then we'd have to figure
out who's victory would be...

374
00:23:32,764 --> 00:23:34,364
Who would be
the bigger ass-ache.

375
00:23:34,444 --> 00:23:38,365
And I'd suggest it's not
an embittered and vengeful crank

376
00:23:38,445 --> 00:23:41,126
crawling back to Westminster.

377
00:23:41,206 --> 00:23:43,206
Worked for you.

378
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:45,702
In fairness, Archie does not serve
the interests of a foreign power.

379
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:46,887
Who asked you?

380
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,023
And while I went
to work for him

381
00:23:48,047 --> 00:23:49,167
because the only
other option

382
00:23:49,207 --> 00:23:50,887
was political oblivion,

383
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:54,128
he is 100 percent committed
to keeping you in post.

384
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,729
Unless you make
it impossible.

385
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,609
I was unaware there was
even a debate on the issue.

386
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,690
Might I make a suggestion,
Prime Minister?

387
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,891
Why are you calling me
Prime Minister

388
00:24:07,971 --> 00:24:10,011
instead of Robert,
all of a sudden?

389
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:12,412
You're the one
who calls me Robert.

390
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,772
What are you up to?

391
00:24:14,892 --> 00:24:19,733
My suggestion would be to find
somebody who can act as a clandestine link

392
00:24:19,813 --> 00:24:22,734
- between us and the opposition to lance this boil.
- No.

393
00:24:22,774 --> 00:24:26,135
Someone who's close to
Francine Bridge and the opposition.

394
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:29,135
- No!
- Well, that's a terrible shame, Prime Minister,

395
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:33,736
because I assumed you hadn't
got your head completely stuck

396
00:24:33,776 --> 00:24:36,016
in the soup tureen of paranoia

397
00:24:36,137 --> 00:24:37,737
from which you've been
guzzling, of late.

398
00:24:37,817 --> 00:24:40,937
This is the last fucking time,
Archie...

399
00:24:40,977 --> 00:24:43,698
I've already asked her
along for a meeting.

400
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,981
Archie!

401
00:24:59,741 --> 00:25:00,981
I thought we agreed.

402
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:03,742
- Rookie error.
- What, you don't want it?

403
00:25:05,382 --> 00:25:08,783
I wanted to give Robert
one last roll of the dice.

404
00:25:08,903 --> 00:25:11,144
Hopefully, it's worked.

405
00:25:11,224 --> 00:25:13,064
You think he still
has it in him?

406
00:25:13,184 --> 00:25:15,984
We'll have to see,
won't we?

407
00:25:16,024 --> 00:25:18,745
But when Robert's
firing on most cylinders,

408
00:25:18,825 --> 00:25:22,266
I would put my money on him
before anybody else.

409
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:27,067
Which is what I did.

410
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:44,630
I did not advise Rachel
to go away.

411
00:25:47,711 --> 00:25:49,791
I made the wrong call
on Hawkins.

412
00:25:52,672 --> 00:25:55,912
You made a call. Your reasons
for doing so were unders...

413
00:25:55,992 --> 00:25:58,953
- I made the wrong call.
- Yeah, okay, you did.

414
00:26:02,314 --> 00:26:03,674
We've never fallen out.

415
00:26:04,714 --> 00:26:07,075
Yes, you were very angry once,

416
00:26:07,195 --> 00:26:10,195
when I was voted onto
the ball committee, and,

417
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,396
you came bottom because
nobody really knew who you were.

418
00:26:14,396 --> 00:26:15,756
I loved you.

419
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:21,198
I just never ever
dared to say it.

420
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:31,240
It doesn't matter now.

421
00:26:48,243 --> 00:26:51,444
Would you like me
to talk to Francine

422
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:54,004
about a meeting with the
Leader of the Opposition?

423
00:26:54,084 --> 00:26:56,084
- Yes.
- And you should address the nation

424
00:26:56,205 --> 00:26:57,685
on the threat
we're under.

425
00:26:57,765 --> 00:27:00,285
Time for honesty
with the people.

426
00:27:00,405 --> 00:27:01,686
You're good at that.

427
00:27:01,766 --> 00:27:02,846
Okay.

428
00:28:06,098 --> 00:28:09,099
You need to stop
watching and start acting.

429
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:12,300
Make them stop or you
will share in the disaster.

430
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,700
Okay.

431
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,660
Interfering with missile
defense systems

432
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,701
in the middle of a geo-political
crisis isn't the solution.

433
00:28:21,582 --> 00:28:23,582
No one thinks we'll go
through with it, do they?

434
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,662
No.

435
00:28:25,742 --> 00:28:30,023
They think your PM is,
and I quote:

436
00:28:30,103 --> 00:28:33,784
“A dying bee
crawling towards oblivion”.

437
00:28:34,304 --> 00:28:35,984
A dying bee?

438
00:28:36,705 --> 00:28:38,705
Maybe.

439
00:28:38,785 --> 00:28:43,506
But make sure they know that's
when you're most likely to get stung.

440
00:28:43,546 --> 00:28:47,987
If they don't push the
kill-switch by 3 pm tomorrow,

441
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:51,027
we will activate Heracles
with consequences

442
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:54,188
that will knock everybody
off their balance.

443
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,350
Our American friends
have found out

444
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:08,351
the next big cyber-attack
will be the economy.

445
00:29:08,471 --> 00:29:13,512
The banking system, all financial
transactions, credit cards...

446
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:15,792
- So, how do we...
- We don't.

447
00:29:15,832 --> 00:29:18,353
The malware is already
buried in the system,

448
00:29:18,473 --> 00:29:21,113
sending back
reassuring data,

449
00:29:21,234 --> 00:29:24,434
while preparing its chaos
once they detonate.

450
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:28,195
And the same will be true across
our entire infrastructure system.

451
00:29:28,275 --> 00:29:31,796
Including nuclear power
stations.

452
00:29:31,876 --> 00:29:34,556
The Prime Minister
is going to address the nation.

453
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:36,197
Then what do we do?

454
00:29:36,277 --> 00:29:40,277
Then we check our hand,
and adopt our best poker face.

455
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,240
I am speaking
to you today,

456
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,041
because of the very grave situation
in which the country finds itself.

457
00:29:59,121 --> 00:30:01,081
Late last night,

458
00:30:01,202 --> 00:30:07,203
the latest in a wave of serious
cyber-attacks was launched on our country.

459
00:30:07,283 --> 00:30:11,244
This one involves the
disruption of our financial systems

460
00:30:11,284 --> 00:30:15,604
and was designed to bring
our economy to its knees.

461
00:30:15,724 --> 00:30:19,725
I'm afraid to say that no one will
be able to use any kind of cards

462
00:30:19,805 --> 00:30:23,006
for purchases or
withdrawing cash.

463
00:30:23,046 --> 00:30:26,607
And our intelligence
shows that this situation

464
00:30:26,727 --> 00:30:29,807
is only likely to worsen
in the coming days.

465
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:32,088
Now, this could involve

466
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:34,128
an attack on
our critical infrastructure,

467
00:30:34,248 --> 00:30:36,969
the like of which
we have never seen before,

468
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:40,809
which could result in
further loss of life,

469
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:43,090
catastrophic impacts
on the vulnerable,

470
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,491
and indeed, the
destruction of our economy.

471
00:30:47,491 --> 00:30:49,251
And it is my firm belief

472
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:53,052
that what began
as “Operation Ruin Britannia”

473
00:30:53,132 --> 00:30:57,693
is now a joint operation
between two hostile nations.

474
00:30:59,813 --> 00:31:01,734
Are you listening?

475
00:31:01,814 --> 00:31:05,054
Does he sound like he's
crawling into the long grass to die?

476
00:31:05,134 --> 00:31:09,455
Unless we have clear evidence that the
kill-switch has been activated in Cerberus

477
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,296
by 3 pm today,

478
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,456
we will go to
a new level of conflict

479
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:16,096
with dire consequences
for everyone.

480
00:31:16,217 --> 00:31:17,777
Including you.

481
00:31:17,817 --> 00:31:19,017
Clearly, though,

482
00:31:19,057 --> 00:31:20,697
the cyber and
information attacks

483
00:31:20,777 --> 00:31:22,858
are part of
an overall assault,

484
00:31:22,978 --> 00:31:25,778
which includes a campaign
of misinformation

485
00:31:25,818 --> 00:31:28,099
extending to my own family

486
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,620
alongside interference
in our political processes

487
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:36,861
that has led to a crisis of faith, in
those whom you should most trust.

488
00:31:36,981 --> 00:31:41,542
As a result, one of our
most distinguished judges

489
00:31:41,582 --> 00:31:42,902
was brutally murdered.

490
00:31:44,822 --> 00:31:48,303
And there are still, according
to the security services,

491
00:31:48,343 --> 00:31:53,384
credible assassination threats
against senior politicians.

492
00:31:53,504 --> 00:31:55,344
Now, as of today,

493
00:31:55,464 --> 00:31:57,745
I have suspended
the party membership

494
00:31:57,825 --> 00:32:01,065
of our candidate in the
forthcoming Medwick byelection,

495
00:32:01,145 --> 00:32:03,586
because of his involvement
in the Firestorm platform,

496
00:32:03,706 --> 00:32:08,227
which I believe is being supported
by Russian specialist cyber-units

497
00:32:08,307 --> 00:32:12,148
and for distributing
racist propaganda.

498
00:32:12,268 --> 00:32:16,148
Now, it is too late for us
to nominate an alternative,

499
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:19,629
so, I call upon you to
vote for any candidate

500
00:32:19,749 --> 00:32:24,310
so long as they are wedded to the
principles of democracy and the rule of law.

501
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,351
Lastly, I have this to say

502
00:32:27,471 --> 00:32:31,512
to those who seek to bring
our country to its knees,

503
00:32:31,552 --> 00:32:37,713
whether that be in Moscow, Beijing
or the capital of any hostile nation.

504
00:32:38,993 --> 00:32:42,714
We may not be the power
we once were.

505
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,834
And perhaps, that is why
we have been chosen

506
00:32:44,874 --> 00:32:48,075
for this demonstration
of brute power.

507
00:32:48,155 --> 00:32:51,876
But we have a history
of continuing the struggle

508
00:32:51,996 --> 00:32:53,796
when the odds
are against us.

509
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,557
And I will stop at nothing

510
00:32:57,597 --> 00:33:00,637
to end this unprecedented,

511
00:33:00,757 --> 00:33:04,918
and completely unprovoked
attack against our country.

512
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:08,319
Cyber-warfare
is still warfare.

513
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:11,720
Just because it takes place out
of sight and without explosions,

514
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,160
does not mean that it does not
cause extraordinary suffering.

515
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:20,401
And we will defend ourselves
by any means necessary,

516
00:33:20,521 --> 00:33:24,762
just as we would if we were being
threatened by nuclear weapons.

517
00:33:24,842 --> 00:33:29,523
We will undertake a struggle
of Herculean proportions

518
00:33:29,563 --> 00:33:33,724
to defend ourselves
as a sovereign nation state.

519
00:33:34,884 --> 00:33:36,245
Thank you.

520
00:33:54,008 --> 00:33:56,329
If I could just have everyone's
attention for a moment?

521
00:33:57,649 --> 00:33:59,809
In this rather
unprecedented time,

522
00:33:59,849 --> 00:34:02,730
I'd like to welcome
the Leader of the Opposition.

523
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:06,010
Very grateful, Robert. That was
an excellent speech, by the way.

524
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,171
Thank you.

525
00:34:11,532 --> 00:34:14,652
- Nice to have you back, Francine.
- All right, no need for that.

526
00:34:16,132 --> 00:34:19,853
So, how does this stop?
What do they want?

527
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,294
We don't know.

528
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:23,254
It looks like
we've reached a point

529
00:34:23,334 --> 00:34:24,934
where the war
is almost running itself.

530
00:34:25,014 --> 00:34:26,295
So, what do we do?

531
00:34:26,335 --> 00:34:28,935
We have an offensive
cyber capacity.

532
00:34:29,015 --> 00:34:33,416
It involves interference
with missile defense systems.

533
00:34:33,496 --> 00:34:37,177
It was developed by
Division 45 of the Cyber Unit

534
00:34:37,257 --> 00:34:39,457
with other countries,
including Israel.

535
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:42,458
But we have modified
its attack vectors.

536
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,258
Modified?

537
00:34:44,338 --> 00:34:46,659
We've made it more of a
shotgun than a precise weapon.

538
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,179
Why?

539
00:34:48,259 --> 00:34:51,420
Because if we unleash it,
it will have two consequences.

540
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,180
First, it could give off
false missile alerts.

541
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,141
Yeah, well, that's
quite dangerous, isn't it?

542
00:34:57,221 --> 00:34:59,541
- That is quite dangerous.
- What's the second consequence?

543
00:34:59,621 --> 00:35:01,462
If we release it
somewhat wildly,

544
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:04,342
then it could fall into
the hands of smaller fish.

545
00:35:04,382 --> 00:35:08,543
It could start off that
inadvertent hot war

546
00:35:08,663 --> 00:35:10,343
we've been warned
so much about.

547
00:35:11,544 --> 00:35:13,664
I think the days of
suggesting nuclear subs

548
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,984
with no weapons
are over.

549
00:35:16,064 --> 00:35:19,265
And I think when the country
is under threat as it is,

550
00:35:19,345 --> 00:35:21,225
it is the duty of any
reasonable opposition

551
00:35:21,306 --> 00:35:23,266
to support the government
in its task.

552
00:35:26,867 --> 00:35:28,067
Thank you, Chris.

553
00:35:29,347 --> 00:35:31,988
Anna will coordinate
with your office

554
00:35:32,068 --> 00:35:34,268
over that other
small matter in Kent.

555
00:35:34,348 --> 00:35:37,869
Unfortunately,
this new J23 group

556
00:35:37,909 --> 00:35:39,709
have issued further threats

557
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:43,190
with regards to violent
interventions in the election.

558
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,230
We're increasing
security,

559
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,071
and I'll be briefing
both of you

560
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:49,511
once our main problem
is out of the way.

561
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:50,871
Watch out.

562
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:52,792
I may not give her back.

563
00:35:56,353 --> 00:35:57,753
We'll see.

564
00:36:00,673 --> 00:36:02,874
Obviously,
we wouldn't actually do it.

565
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:05,074
Release Heracles.

566
00:36:05,194 --> 00:36:07,275
I've been asked before,

567
00:36:07,355 --> 00:36:11,195
in the event of a nuclear
attack, would I push the button?

568
00:36:11,276 --> 00:36:14,276
And your answer
is clearly “yes”, because...

569
00:36:15,356 --> 00:36:16,837
That's how deterrents work.

570
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:21,758
Would you?

571
00:36:23,518 --> 00:36:25,078
Would I push a button

572
00:36:25,198 --> 00:36:27,799
that incinerated millions
of men, women and children?

573
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,761
I'm afraid sighing
doesn't really cut it.

574
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:40,441
- Hegel...
- No.

575
00:36:40,521 --> 00:36:43,882
- I don't think philosophy...
- There's always a place for philosophy.

576
00:36:43,922 --> 00:36:46,363
And I think there's
a genuine dialectic

577
00:36:46,403 --> 00:36:48,363
- when it comes to...
- Would you push the button?

578
00:36:52,164 --> 00:36:55,404
If you saw a nuclear missile
headed towards London.

579
00:36:57,725 --> 00:37:00,285
You know
what I'd do.

580
00:37:11,928 --> 00:37:14,888
I'm heading over
to Labor Party HQ.

581
00:37:14,928 --> 00:37:17,369
And then, down to Kent
with Francine.

582
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:19,929
But you'll come back?

583
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,970
What do you think?

584
00:37:28,571 --> 00:37:30,011
- Hi.
- Hi!

585
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:36,212
They've detected the
Cerberus virus in a nuclear plant.

586
00:37:36,293 --> 00:37:38,973
It's been lying dormant
and harvesting data.

587
00:37:40,493 --> 00:37:42,374
When's the deadline?

588
00:37:43,934 --> 00:37:45,174
30 minutes.

589
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,782
Our currency's taken
a massive hit.

590
00:38:21,862 --> 00:38:23,462
Stock exchange suspended.

591
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:27,983
No time-stamping possible on any
transactions makes it impossible.

592
00:38:28,063 --> 00:38:30,343
We're heading
for total financial collapse.

593
00:38:40,825 --> 00:38:42,946
You are aware of the risks?

594
00:38:44,226 --> 00:38:48,787
This has the potential
to start World War III.

595
00:38:48,867 --> 00:38:53,348
It will destabilize anti-missile
defenses around the globe.

596
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:02,470
How about the Americans?

597
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,590
Have we heard anything?

598
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,351
A sign of any sort?

599
00:39:09,111 --> 00:39:10,351
Nothing.

600
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:19,713
So, the idea is to make it
less of an election,

601
00:39:19,793 --> 00:39:22,314
more a referendum
on democracy.

602
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:24,314
Yep.
Agree with that.

603
00:39:24,394 --> 00:39:27,475
- Tolerance.
- Wishy-washy.

604
00:39:27,555 --> 00:39:29,835
Well, we can toughen it up,
but we need to make sure

605
00:39:29,915 --> 00:39:31,916
you sound reasonable
next to Rodger.

606
00:39:31,956 --> 00:39:33,276
That shouldn't be too difficult.

607
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,080
What's wishy-washy
about tolerance?

608
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,361
I'm just saying
better words, that's all.

609
00:39:58,401 --> 00:40:00,201
Don't give yourself
a hot flush!

610
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:02,682
How many bloody times...
They're not a joke.

611
00:40:02,762 --> 00:40:04,482
I know! I'm sorry.

612
00:40:15,004 --> 00:40:17,125
Don't do it!

613
00:40:17,245 --> 00:40:18,925
We need
a signal, Kelly.

614
00:40:19,005 --> 00:40:20,725
We need a sign.

615
00:40:20,805 --> 00:40:22,606
This is not the
time to light a fuse.

616
00:40:22,726 --> 00:40:25,046
We are piling pressure
on both players.

617
00:40:25,126 --> 00:40:28,767
They have to send an
immediate message that it's over,

618
00:40:28,847 --> 00:40:30,407
or we go active.

619
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:40,089
Yeah?

620
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:44,090
Thank you.

621
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,931
That was the Governor
of the Bank of England.

622
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,611
The pound is
in total free-fall,

623
00:40:48,731 --> 00:40:51,732
and all their systems are
compromised by Cerberus.

624
00:40:51,812 --> 00:40:54,212
They can't do a thing.

625
00:40:54,292 --> 00:40:56,012
We're heading for the buffers.

626
00:41:05,814 --> 00:41:07,335
Stand by, Eleanor.

627
00:41:08,855 --> 00:41:10,095
Stand by.

628
00:41:10,215 --> 00:41:13,016
Well, go on then,
if you want to get past.

629
00:41:17,937 --> 00:41:19,417
Did he just hit your car?

630
00:41:22,818 --> 00:41:23,938
Activate Heracles.

631
00:41:23,978 --> 00:41:25,578
Do it now!

632
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:28,699
Out! Get out, get out!

633
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:30,619
- What's going on?
- No, I know him! He's safe.

634
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:32,020
He's one of Eleanor's, go, go!

635
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,020
- Get out, get out!
- Miss, clear the vehicle. Go!

636
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,581
Go!

637
00:41:43,982 --> 00:41:46,102
Wait!
There's a change in the pattern.

638
00:41:54,464 --> 00:41:56,224
Timestamping's
back to normal!

639
00:41:56,304 --> 00:41:58,305
Transactions are clearing again.

640
00:41:58,385 --> 00:42:00,465
They've blinked.

641
00:42:01,506 --> 00:42:02,866
There's a kill-switch.

642
00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:18,549
With both the US
and the Chinese fleets

643
00:42:18,629 --> 00:42:21,069
pulling back from the brink
in the South China Sea,

644
00:42:21,149 --> 00:42:25,430
there are hopes that the cyber
threat to the UK has also diminished.

645
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:28,831
The Prime Minister, Robert
Sutherland, had this to say earlier.

646
00:42:28,911 --> 00:42:34,752
Assassinations, electoral
interference, false alerts.

647
00:42:34,832 --> 00:42:37,393
And lastly,
an all-out cyber-attack.

648
00:42:40,593 --> 00:42:41,994
The aim?

649
00:42:42,074 --> 00:42:43,514
To create such chaos,

650
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,434
that it would
destroy our democracy,

651
00:42:45,514 --> 00:42:47,995
and show the world
what damage can be inflicted

652
00:42:48,075 --> 00:42:50,515
without the need
for missiles.

653
00:42:50,595 --> 00:42:52,556
I am pleased
to tell you tonight,

654
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,796
that the threat appears
to have receded,

655
00:42:54,876 --> 00:42:58,517
thanks to the efforts
of our own cyber defenses.

656
00:42:58,597 --> 00:43:00,957
We should be
in no doubt, however,

657
00:43:00,997 --> 00:43:03,118
that there is no room
for complacency.

658
00:43:03,238 --> 00:43:07,959
For next time, the
consequences could be far worse.

659
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:10,879
Tonight, I must also
express my outrage

660
00:43:10,959 --> 00:43:13,840
at another terror attack on
a parliamentary candidate,

661
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,480
Francine Bridge,

662
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,841
who has fortunately survived
without major injury.

663
00:43:20,441 --> 00:43:23,962
The life of my colleague
and friend, Anna Marshall,

664
00:43:24,002 --> 00:43:27,003
however, hangs
in the balance.

665
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:30,963
Anna represents the best
traditions of our country.

666
00:43:31,764 --> 00:43:34,084
Tolerance, decency,

667
00:43:34,164 --> 00:43:37,085
and a desire to serve
the national interests.

668
00:43:38,405 --> 00:43:41,886
I hope you will hold
her in your prayers,

669
00:43:41,966 --> 00:43:43,286
as I do.
