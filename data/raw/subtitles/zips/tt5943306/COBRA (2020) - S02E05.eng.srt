1
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:04,844
A firestorm is caused by
baskets of incendiaries,

2
00:00:04,924 --> 00:00:06,545
and not a single bomb.

3
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:09,705
Neither the silencing
of a lone patriot,

4
00:00:09,785 --> 00:00:12,346
nor the disappearance
of one truth-telling journalist

5
00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:15,146
will stop the flames
of truth from spreading.

6
00:00:15,186 --> 00:00:16,987
Water may douse the flames,

7
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:19,347
but who controls the water?

8
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:21,628
Think before you drink.

9
00:00:24,988 --> 00:00:29,149
Oh, my God, she has made me
sound like a complete and utter idiot.

10
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,709
Well, I'm sure it's just...

11
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:33,430
"Seemingly cloth-eared
to current debates

12
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,470
on privilege
and racial justice,

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,511
she moans about the size
of the Downing Street flat,

14
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:40,551
and claims that
her infamous comment

15
00:00:40,671 --> 00:00:42,592
that posh white girls
do not belong in prison

16
00:00:42,712 --> 00:00:45,192
was not understood
'in context'...

17
00:00:46,473 --> 00:00:49,193
I made a joke
about the flat

18
00:00:49,273 --> 00:00:51,073
because the cameraman
banged his head.

19
00:00:51,153 --> 00:00:53,994
Oh. Come on,
this is just newspapers.

20
00:00:54,074 --> 00:00:57,435
It's an absolute
bloody disaster.

21
00:01:02,076 --> 00:01:04,196
Look, uh,
Firestorm is back.

22
00:01:05,836 --> 00:01:07,637
I have to, uh...

23
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,920
Well, are they messing
with our water now?

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,360
Fraser's looking into it,
Prime Minister.

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,441
And who snatched Hari Misra?

26
00:01:27,561 --> 00:01:30,481
- Ask the people he pissed off with his scoops.
- What, including us?

27
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:32,642
Contrary to popular myth
and social media...

28
00:01:32,722 --> 00:01:36,363
Maybe my wife's had him snatched
and is overseeing his torture somewhere.

29
00:01:36,443 --> 00:01:38,443
That's what they'll be saying,
I imagine.

30
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:40,899
Well, Misra's recent output certainly
means the finger will point at us

31
00:01:40,923 --> 00:01:43,420
- to make us look bad.
- And you're sure that wasn't your objective as well?

32
00:01:43,444 --> 00:01:45,204
A little strategic own-goal?

33
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:48,445
Because I'm getting a bit doubtful
to whose side anyone is on right now.

34
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,805
We have done nothing
to Hari Misra.

35
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:53,646
Not to make you look bad,
or for any other reason.

36
00:01:53,726 --> 00:01:56,447
We failed to pick him up, and
even if we had got there first,

37
00:01:56,487 --> 00:01:59,207
we don't have an
assassination program,

38
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:00,847
as you know perfectly well.

39
00:02:00,927 --> 00:02:03,008
Well, I'm beginning
to question merits of that.

40
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:05,128
Especially when it comes
to journalists.

41
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:08,289
We can announce a change of policy
on the Number 10 Twitter feed if you like?

42
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,291
Okay, keep me informed.

43
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,451
Thanks.

44
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:19,867
Problems with the water
down in Kent.

45
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:22,132
Oh, yeah, my brother
mentioned that to me.

46
00:02:22,172 --> 00:02:24,052
Been on and off
for a while now,

47
00:02:24,172 --> 00:02:26,389
but the water company's saying
that the pressure's completely normal.

48
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,493
Well, now, there's stuff
flying all over social media

49
00:02:28,573 --> 00:02:30,733
- saying that it isn't safe to drink.
- Really?

50
00:02:31,854 --> 00:02:33,734
Do you think
it might be another...

51
00:02:33,774 --> 00:02:37,855
Water systems would be a
prime target for a cyber-attack.

52
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:40,535
I'll speak to the
Intelligence Chief.

53
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:43,576
They haven't flagged any
malware in the system yet.

54
00:02:43,616 --> 00:02:45,456
We are clearly under attack

55
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:48,177
from a coalition
of powerful state actors,

56
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:52,458
and they seem to be taking
turns to occupy the driving seat.

57
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:54,858
Foreign Secretary is not wrong.

58
00:02:54,978 --> 00:02:56,859
But first things first,

59
00:02:56,899 --> 00:02:59,179
my counterpart
at the American Embassy

60
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:03,620
has assured me that the Misra
story we intercepted from his computer

61
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,461
about their involvement
in the ship explosion in Kent

62
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,981
was fake news
planted by the Chinese.

63
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:12,982
- And what do you think?
- We're still looking at the evidence.

64
00:03:13,022 --> 00:03:17,583
Well, early evidence suggests that
something odd went on down there.

65
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:20,783
Fraser mentioned
some kind of sonic event.

66
00:03:20,863 --> 00:03:25,184
And tension's very high between the
Yanks and the Chinese at the moment.

67
00:03:25,264 --> 00:03:27,745
Would the Americans really...

68
00:03:27,865 --> 00:03:29,465
Well, not deliberately.

69
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:31,466
But they could be making
a point to the Chinese

70
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:33,586
about their
underwater capacities.

71
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:37,067
Especially with everything so
on edge in the South China Sea.

72
00:03:37,187 --> 00:03:38,787
And they did make it
very clear

73
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:41,308
that they were unhappy
with the drilling permissions

74
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:44,188
that we granted
to the Jiayou Corporation.

75
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:48,749
I want reprisals.

76
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:51,470
- What, against the Americans?
- No.

77
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,630
Not them for now
until the facts are clearer.

78
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,311
But identify some targets
from the other two who we know

79
00:03:57,351 --> 00:03:58,871
are behind Ruin Britannia.

80
00:03:58,911 --> 00:04:01,191
- Yeah, the problem with that...
- I know the problems.

81
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:04,312
Keep it largely symbolic,
but not entirely pain-free.

82
00:04:04,352 --> 00:04:07,633
A few surgical strikes that will
make both Russia and China jump.

83
00:04:07,753 --> 00:04:10,073
A central bank,
TV network.

84
00:04:10,193 --> 00:04:11,794
Use your imagination.

85
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:14,754
I am not gonna sit here
and take this.

86
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,457
Did you, um, ask the
government about Hari Misra?

87
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:52,002
Yeah, they claimed they don't
know anything. Maybe they don't.

88
00:04:52,122 --> 00:04:56,242
All right, I will say a few
words, announce your candidacy

89
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,563
- and then hand over to you.
- What's all this about?

90
00:04:58,683 --> 00:05:00,883
No idea. What's wrong
with the tap water?

91
00:05:00,923 --> 00:05:02,444
Nothing, as far as I know.

92
00:05:02,564 --> 00:05:04,684
What's a quantum algorithm?

93
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:06,605
No idea.

94
00:05:06,685 --> 00:05:08,605
But I do know that
you can put the word "quantum"

95
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:12,046
in front of any other bullshit and
all of a sudden it looks high status.

96
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:19,887
Good morning, everybody,
and thank you for coming.

97
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:22,248
As you can see with me
is Francine Bridge.

98
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:24,368
Uh, we'll take a few questions.
Maybe five minutes,

99
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:26,224
and then we really
will have to move on, okay?

100
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:28,129
But I really
appreciate you coming.

101
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:31,690
Over to Francine.

102
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:49,373
Hey.

103
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:56,134
Who's drunk all the water?

104
00:05:58,495 --> 00:06:00,815
There's water
in the kettle still.

105
00:06:00,935 --> 00:06:02,616
You know I'm not
drinking that.

106
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,576
You don't really
believe all that crap

107
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:06,777
that they're poisoning us
with equations, do you?

108
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:08,137
Algorithms.

109
00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:09,593
And Lin says it's actually
quite dangerous.

110
00:06:09,617 --> 00:06:11,137
Lin listens to Michael Buble,

111
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:12,698
refused to get
her kids vaccinated,

112
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:14,698
and is voting for that
racist's nonce.

113
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:18,059
Yeah, she's also my best mate
and Danny's godmother.

114
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:19,499
So...

115
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,259
I'm gonna go and get
some bottled stuff,

116
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,020
just so we're sure.

117
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,340
Bring me back a Kit-Kat then.

118
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,461
Shut up. "Kit-Kat."

119
00:06:26,581 --> 00:06:28,261
You're meant to be on a diet.

120
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:30,701
I've got a naturally high
metabolism, I don't need to diet.

121
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:33,902
Oh! Be nice to be able to see
your cock again, though, right?

122
00:06:33,942 --> 00:06:36,943
You tell me. It fell off last
week through lack of use.

123
00:06:39,503 --> 00:06:42,464
Danny!
Gonna go to the shops.

124
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:46,385
You really
gonna drink that?

125
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:48,465
Yeah.

126
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:57,507
You're an idiot.

127
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:01,147
Don't be a mean ol' Jezebel.

128
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:03,508
- Get me a Kit-Kat.
- Yeah, yeah.

129
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:05,508
- Danny?
- I'm coming.

130
00:07:05,588 --> 00:07:07,365
First they came with their
pills and vaccinations,

131
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:09,029
now it's the water.

132
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:10,709
Ask yourselves this:

133
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:13,150
Why was the water supply
suspended for emergency work

134
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,630
on the water main
a month ago?

135
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,031
To carry out an emergency
work on a water main?

136
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:19,071
And why has the pressure
been so weird recently?

137
00:07:19,151 --> 00:07:22,712
Probably because someone's
using buried malware to manipulate it.

138
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:26,913
They're making the data in the water
plants look normal to the technicians,

139
00:07:26,953 --> 00:07:29,473
while lowering the pressure
to consumers.

140
00:07:29,593 --> 00:07:31,954
They're going for slow drip
rather than a drought,

141
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,394
which is even more frustrating.

142
00:07:33,474 --> 00:07:36,034
As any man over 50 knows.

143
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:41,476
No coincidence, I suppose,
they've chosen an area

144
00:07:41,596 --> 00:07:44,276
where a bitter election
is taking place.

145
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:46,717
Well, what's worrying me
is that they've teamed up

146
00:07:46,797 --> 00:07:50,397
to hit back for this week's
symbolic reprisals.

147
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:52,838
Ganging up and showing off?

148
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,038
Player one, world leaders
and sophisticated malware.

149
00:07:56,078 --> 00:08:00,519
Player two, world leaders
and misinformation and chaos.

150
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,480
Others turning in the chips
in their pockets,

151
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
waiting for the next
spin of the wheel.

152
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,841
Why did it start though?

153
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:10,241
Because that's what happens

154
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,282
when you have the weapons
and the conditions are right.

155
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:17,723
Spark becomes flame,
becomes inferno.

156
00:08:17,803 --> 00:08:21,484
First World War could have
been Prussian railway timetables.

157
00:08:21,524 --> 00:08:24,284
On a happier note,

158
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,965
you know how scientists
can develop weapons

159
00:08:27,045 --> 00:08:30,725
that can immobilize you
purely through a vile stench?

160
00:08:30,765 --> 00:08:33,006
I am familiar
with the concept.

161
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:36,487
They would struggle to
find one that has an impact

162
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:40,607
as strong as our new candidate
from Kent House.

163
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:45,208
On Anna Marshall's
delicate little schnoz.

164
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:48,489
Have you ever actually
been to Kent?

165
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,369
As opposed to figuratively?

166
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:51,866
Of course
I've actually been to Kent.

167
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,090
I'm not talking about
a pint of prawns in Deal.

168
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,611
I'm talking about the Medway
towns and the real people.

169
00:08:57,691 --> 00:09:00,211
Oh, bad news, Deal residents,
you don't actually exist.

170
00:09:00,251 --> 00:09:01,972
Okay, I think it's given
that you two

171
00:09:02,012 --> 00:09:04,852
aren't going to be sharing
a picnic in Glyndebourne.

172
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:07,093
Can we just focus
on the issues in hand?

173
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,733
Good call.

174
00:09:08,853 --> 00:09:11,213
The opposition will attack us
if they have any sense.

175
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:13,214
On the housing issue.

176
00:09:13,254 --> 00:09:16,495
Yeah, plus the water issue, which
has suddenly emerged from nowhere.

177
00:09:16,615 --> 00:09:20,775
I'm not gonna talk about
housing plans or water.

178
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:23,616
You didn't put me in this seat
to fight clean and you know it.

179
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,136
So, stop being hypocrites.

180
00:09:26,256 --> 00:09:28,217
You put me in it

181
00:09:28,257 --> 00:09:30,097
to defeat
a resurgent opposition

182
00:09:30,217 --> 00:09:34,738
from winning a seat
you can ill-afford to lose.

183
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:37,459
This election's gonna be
about one thing for me.

184
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:40,499
And that's stopping
Francine Bridge

185
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:45,020
from representing a constituency
totally at odds with her values.

186
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,701
- Which values are those then?
- -Oh, what, you don't know?

187
00:09:47,741 --> 00:09:50,501
- Mimsy, lefty.
- Feminine.

188
00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:52,262
Chuck it in
if you like, Archie.

189
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:55,342
But I'll certainly be appealing
to the female vote.

190
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:57,583
One of the mistakes
you make is to assume

191
00:09:57,623 --> 00:09:59,783
that everybody agrees
with your values

192
00:09:59,863 --> 00:10:02,584
when it's just a handful
of media lovies

193
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:05,984
posting photos of their
negronis on Instagram.

194
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:07,625
Negronis.

195
00:10:07,705 --> 00:10:09,905
It's all about the skinny
bitches now, Rodger.

196
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,906
They had an open goal,

197
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,346
but they gambled
with her selection.

198
00:10:14,386 --> 00:10:16,106
- Fresh lime not cordial...
- Anna.

199
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:19,267
And they're so desperate to
get her back into parliament.

200
00:10:19,347 --> 00:10:21,508
It could be their undoing.

201
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:26,108
She's gonna be... soft
on all kinds of issues,

202
00:10:26,228 --> 00:10:30,389
which I intend to hit her with
again and again and again.

203
00:10:30,469 --> 00:10:32,350
And that's how we're
gonna win that seat.

204
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,790
No need to make it
about race, Rodger.

205
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,391
Do not target that.

206
00:10:36,471 --> 00:10:38,711
Oh, don't worry, Joseph, I
have no intention of doing so.

207
00:10:40,751 --> 00:10:42,272
I won't need to.

208
00:10:58,235 --> 00:11:01,035
Hi, Anna, I've just...

209
00:11:01,115 --> 00:11:03,756
- Don't dwell on it.
- She made me look like a complete idiot.

210
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,756
I trusted her.

211
00:11:05,876 --> 00:11:10,117
Okay. Beginner's error.
It's happened to us all.

212
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:12,478
I did an interview once,
they used everything I said,

213
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:14,638
but made me look like
a simpering idiot.

214
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:16,919
Which I'm not.

215
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:19,919
Every joke,
every suggestion of irony...

216
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:21,520
I'm funny, Anna.

217
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,400
I know, you're a hoot.

218
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,761
I'm a harpy, a racist.

219
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:30,521
The wicked witch
pulling her husband's strings,

220
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:32,762
when everybody knows
that's you.

221
00:11:32,802 --> 00:11:34,882
You'd be surprised.

222
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:39,763
Well, he's a bit jealous,
isn't he?

223
00:11:40,763 --> 00:11:42,124
Of whom?

224
00:11:42,164 --> 00:11:44,364
Francine Bridge.

225
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,125
He worries you prefer her
to Hawkins.

226
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,925
News flash: I do.

227
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:51,926
Yeah, but to Rob that's like
saying you prefer her to him.

228
00:11:52,006 --> 00:11:53,526
It's ridiculous.

229
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,408
Listen, don't worry about
the response to the article.

230
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:04,248
Well, I'm just
never gonna be enough.

231
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:06,649
You know, the...

232
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:09,929
the way I dress,
the way I speak, my body.

233
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:11,410
The fact that I'm Jewish.

234
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,130
Yeah, Jewish lawyer to boot.

235
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,650
Come on, you must be
pulling strings somewhere.

236
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,131
Well, I had a
Ukrainian oligarch murdered

237
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,171
to spare my blushes over

238
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,372
some bullshit
that wasn't even my fault.

239
00:12:22,412 --> 00:12:24,252
So, you know,
join the dots, sheeple.

240
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:29,533
Maybe you need a break
or something.

241
00:12:29,653 --> 00:12:31,534
I don't know,
go and visit Ellie?

242
00:12:35,014 --> 00:12:38,015
I don't think I can live in this
bloody flat for much longer.

243
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:42,016
Well, it's little more than
a matchbox after all.

244
00:12:42,056 --> 00:12:45,816
I literally feel
like I'm going insane.

245
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:48,737
Talk to Robert.

246
00:12:48,777 --> 00:12:50,777
I can't, he's got
too much on his plate.

247
00:12:50,897 --> 00:12:52,538
Talk to him now.

248
00:12:52,618 --> 00:12:54,738
It's not fair
what they're doing to you.

249
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:01,380
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

250
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,740
Thank you. Thanks.

251
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,157
Uh, can I ask you a personal
question? So, don't be offended,

252
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:10,501
but, uh, anything happening
between you and Misra?

253
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,782
No.

254
00:13:12,422 --> 00:13:13,782
Had to ask.

255
00:13:13,822 --> 00:13:15,782
But something really
bad's happened, Chris.

256
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:18,543
The fire at his office,
his disappearance, I just...

257
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:21,944
- Get back to London, you northern monkey.
- Poisoning our water.

258
00:13:22,024 --> 00:13:24,064
Ah, it's like Burnley-on-Sea.

259
00:13:24,144 --> 00:13:26,545
Spoken like a true woman
of the people.

260
00:13:26,665 --> 00:13:29,121
They're having a hard time
deciding if I'm a metropolitan elitist,

261
00:13:29,145 --> 00:13:31,265
- or Moss-Side drug dealer.
- Bit of both, actually.

262
00:13:31,305 --> 00:13:35,146
Chorlton, mate.
Creative hub of Manchester.

263
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:37,427
There's a very ugly mood
in this town.

264
00:13:37,547 --> 00:13:39,267
And it's only gonna get worse.

265
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:48,309
Yes?

266
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:51,910
I'm afraid I have some
disturbing news

267
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,510
linked to the water in Kent,
Prime Minister.

268
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,511
And I was on such
a winning streak.

269
00:13:56,551 --> 00:14:00,551
A child in Rochester
called Simon Drake

270
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:03,672
has developed
amoebic meningitis.

271
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:05,672
And that's different from...

272
00:14:05,752 --> 00:14:08,793
Yeah, it's caused by a
bacteria called Naegleria fowleri,

273
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:12,314
that attacks the brain
and is always almost fatal.

274
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,514
How did he catch it?

275
00:14:13,554 --> 00:14:15,914
Well, you normally get it by

276
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:19,275
breathing contaminated water
through the nose.

277
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:21,516
- And had he?
- They're investigating.

278
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:24,556
It's very rare,
especially in the UK.

279
00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:29,677
- They wouldn't...
- It could be a coincidence,

280
00:14:29,757 --> 00:14:31,918
but it's been picked up on
by the trolls and the bots,

281
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,558
and they're exploiting it
to the maximum effect.

282
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:38,839
Prepare the Cobra room.

283
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,161
Children are dying for this
government's experiments.

284
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:50,161
Luckily, we will soon
have an opportunity

285
00:14:50,281 --> 00:14:52,962
to tell them what we
think of them at the polls.

286
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:56,563
Justice for Simon.
Vote nobody.

287
00:14:56,683 --> 00:14:58,563
What's that symbol they use?

288
00:14:58,683 --> 00:15:01,684
It's similar to an image used
by a Chilean fascist group

289
00:15:01,764 --> 00:15:05,324
called Patria y Libertad in the
1970s, but they're long gone.

290
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,645
Chile?

291
00:15:06,685 --> 00:15:09,525
I recently reviewed
Ellie's security.

292
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:12,806
How's the child doing?

293
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,926
ICU, very poorly.

294
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:18,543
What's the water company saying?

295
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:20,447
That the water
is completely safe,

296
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:23,648
but if people are worried, they
should boil it and avoid inhaling it.

297
00:15:23,688 --> 00:15:25,768
- Who inhales water?
- Showers, etc.

298
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:27,929
The bacteria can't actually
be spread by drinking

299
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:31,209
- because stomach acid neutralizes it.
- Uh.

300
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:33,290
Let me get this straight.

301
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,811
First, they fooled around
with the water supply.

302
00:15:36,851 --> 00:15:38,651
Then they started
a blizzard of rumor,

303
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:41,572
and now they're telling people
not to vote in the election.

304
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:48,933
Get our bloody candidate
to drink a big glass of water.

305
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:50,973
Now, there's a
win-win scenario.

306
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:53,054
I'll get down there
as soon as I can.

307
00:15:53,174 --> 00:15:54,854
Is that such a good idea?

308
00:15:54,934 --> 00:15:57,151
Well, it worked during the solar
storm. You can't run from the people.

309
00:15:57,175 --> 00:15:59,815
As Mussolini discovered from
the wrong end of a meat hook.

310
00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:02,096
Enough with the wise cracks
and smart alec replies.

311
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:04,072
- Does anybody see what's happening here?
- We do see...

312
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,657
One thing after another.
Death by a thousand cuts.

313
00:16:06,697 --> 00:16:08,697
I mean, they're not
even asking for anything.

314
00:16:10,857 --> 00:16:14,698
It's like we've just become
fucking game-board for them.

315
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:17,179
That's exactly what
it's like, Prime Minister.

316
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:20,539
Problem is,
now that it's started,

317
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,940
I'm not sure anyone knows
how this game ends.

318
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,941
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna hide
behind a punch of useless pawns.

319
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:30,301
- Hit back hard.
- We've just done that.

320
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:33,302
Then try again, harder.

321
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:10,549
It's like bloody Nuremberg,
down this close.

322
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,830
All these swastika things.

323
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,390
Nobody around here
is gonna vote.

324
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,311
- I am.
- Good.

325
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,848
They're kids dying in hospital because
of what they're doing to the water.

326
00:17:21,872 --> 00:17:24,352
- There's one case.
- Ah, believe what you want to believe.

327
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:27,113
I've got more beliefs,
in case you're interested.

328
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:29,833
Vaccinations are a triumph
of medical science.

329
00:17:29,873 --> 00:17:32,754
Our dad died before one
had a chance to save him.

330
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:36,274
And there's nothing in the water
apart from hydrogen, oxygen,

331
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:39,355
and a little bit of fluoride to
stop your teeth from falling out.

332
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:41,395
I'm not interested,
Audrey.

333
00:17:41,516 --> 00:17:45,116
- Just 'cos you went to college.
- Yeah, I did go to college, Tina. Yeah.

334
00:17:45,236 --> 00:17:48,597
Because my dad wasn't a moron, and
he thought education was a good thing.

335
00:17:48,677 --> 00:17:50,437
I'm proud I went
to college, actually.

336
00:17:50,557 --> 00:17:54,318
It stopped me turning into some
two-bob conspiracy-peddling...

337
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:57,919
Well, go on, love,
say it.

338
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:59,879
I know what you've
always thought of me.

339
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,640
Moppet.

340
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,841
You stuck-up little cow.

341
00:18:06,881 --> 00:18:08,761
And give it a rest
about your dad.

342
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:10,841
Like he's the only person
who ever died,

343
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:14,562
- and you're the only person who cares.
- Fuck you.

344
00:18:17,283 --> 00:18:19,923
A lot of people
think like she does.

345
00:18:20,043 --> 00:18:22,044
Can you blame her,
with this lot in power?

346
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:23,844
The boat going up like that
all of a sudden

347
00:18:23,884 --> 00:18:25,284
and now this shit
with the water.

348
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:26,885
There is no shit
with the water.

349
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:30,045
Well, something's going on.
How did that kid get that...

350
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:31,886
Nigeria.

351
00:18:32,006 --> 00:18:34,006
Naegleria fowleri.

352
00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:38,847
I don't know, Cary.
Maybe...

353
00:18:38,887 --> 00:18:41,047
maybe jumped off a locke
into a filthy canal

354
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:43,568
like you were wasted
when you were 15.

355
00:18:43,608 --> 00:18:46,889
Remember that kid who ripped his
bullocks off on the submerged bicycle?

356
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:48,689
God.

357
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:50,625
Was that actually true, or did
they just say that to scare us?

358
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:52,250
I don't know.
Worked though.

359
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,850
Well, there you are then.

360
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,451
Well...

361
00:18:56,571 --> 00:19:00,011
Hello. You from
the local Labor Party?

362
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:01,772
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

363
00:19:04,332 --> 00:19:05,572
What do you think?

364
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:09,453
Yeah, I think she'll win.

365
00:19:09,573 --> 00:19:12,094
She got a better smile
than that Tory doughnut.

366
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:13,454
You just fancy her.

367
00:19:13,574 --> 00:19:15,070
I'm not gonna lie,
I've got the ragin' horn, mate.

368
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:17,095
Oh. Yuck.

369
00:19:17,175 --> 00:19:18,815
It's disgusting.

370
00:19:20,695 --> 00:19:22,576
You sure there's nothing up
with the water?

371
00:19:24,016 --> 00:19:25,376
The water is safe.

372
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,137
It's my department,
I really would know.

373
00:19:28,257 --> 00:19:31,618
Tina's just worried. She's
got a big heart, that's all.

374
00:19:31,698 --> 00:19:34,698
And that kid with all 'em tubes
has really upset her.

375
00:19:36,018 --> 00:19:37,699
Okay. Okay.

376
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:40,259
Big-hearted moppet.

377
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:43,140
Well,
here comes a Tory moppet.

378
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,780
Good evening, sir.

379
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,261
Reckon I can keep these bastards
here for an hour at least.

380
00:19:47,341 --> 00:19:51,702
So, I'm very undecided in this
election, and I was wondering...

381
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:54,902
Mr. Hawkins?

382
00:19:55,022 --> 00:19:56,398
Do you know if the water
in Kent is safe to drink?

383
00:19:56,422 --> 00:19:57,863
I've been assured
that it is.

384
00:19:57,903 --> 00:20:00,303
That's not the same as saying
it actually is though.

385
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,184
I mean, we're all
assured that it is.

386
00:20:02,304 --> 00:20:04,520
Francine Bridge made a categoric
statement saying that she...

387
00:20:04,544 --> 00:20:06,384
Well, to be fair,
it's probably cleaner

388
00:20:06,424 --> 00:20:09,585
than the water
where she comes from.

389
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,866
Hard as nails, that water
in the inner cities.

390
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:15,586
I doubt she's even
tasted our Kent water.

391
00:20:18,187 --> 00:20:19,267
Cheers.

392
00:20:20,627 --> 00:20:22,108
He said what?

393
00:20:23,668 --> 00:20:25,428
No, tell me exactly.

394
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:33,630
Right. I'll raise it
directly with the PM.

395
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,831
Drinking unclean water
is an obvious trope

396
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:39,391
that she's not
really British.

397
00:20:39,431 --> 00:20:43,272
- Yes, but he said...
- Oh, come on, Robert!

398
00:20:43,352 --> 00:20:46,593
One thing to be an opportunist,
but another to be willfully dense.

399
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:49,473
- Willfully what?
- This is an absolute disgrace!

400
00:20:49,593 --> 00:20:51,353
It's clear enough
what he was doing.

401
00:20:51,393 --> 00:20:53,114
It's completely unacceptable.

402
00:20:53,194 --> 00:20:57,435
Also, what's with "I'm assured
the water is safe to drink"?

403
00:20:57,555 --> 00:20:59,115
- Okay.
- Okay, what?

404
00:20:59,195 --> 00:21:01,051
- Okay, point taken.
- Okay, point taken, and what?

405
00:21:01,075 --> 00:21:03,476
We'll make sure he doesn't
overstep the mark like that again.

406
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,637
That's it?

407
00:21:06,677 --> 00:21:08,893
If you book a ride on a tiger you
cannot then complain about its stripes.

408
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:11,077
I don't believe it.

409
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:13,798
- I can't believe you don't have a problem.
- Don't go there, Anna.

410
00:21:13,878 --> 00:21:15,598
I don't really
take kindly to lectures

411
00:21:15,638 --> 00:21:17,839
about what my reaction
should be to anything.

412
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:20,879
The fact is, this is a hard
fight and he's our dog.

413
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:22,440
A dog whistle, you mean.

414
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,560
Look, he's fighting a battle
based on social conservatism.

415
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,401
I agree with much of that.

416
00:21:27,481 --> 00:21:29,801
I don't support
the identity extremists either,

417
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:32,482
but where he crosses a line,
we rein him in.

418
00:21:32,602 --> 00:21:33,922
I would say
he is over the line,

419
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,643
- but it's still in earshot.
- Bullocks!

420
00:21:38,203 --> 00:21:40,883
And that's what passes
for debate at St Paul's, is it?

421
00:21:40,923 --> 00:21:44,724
Oh, spare me the self-made
salt of the earth patter, Joseph.

422
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:48,125
You can keep the speech about your
hardworking mum for party conferences.

423
00:21:48,205 --> 00:21:49,885
A bit envious,

424
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:52,606
because I actually have
an audience bigger than one.

425
00:21:56,687 --> 00:21:59,367
Joseph, could you
excuse us for a moment?

426
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:03,848
Sure.

427
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,651
- How much of this is because it's Francine?
- What?

428
00:22:17,731 --> 00:22:21,411
How much would you be
complaining if it wasn't your friend?

429
00:22:24,572 --> 00:22:28,373
Because I think you'd rather
see her back in parliament

430
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,053
than our candidate.
In fact...

431
00:22:32,134 --> 00:22:33,414
if you lived in Kent,

432
00:22:33,494 --> 00:22:35,454
I suspect you'd secretly
vote for her as well.

433
00:22:35,574 --> 00:22:37,671
I think it's been well established
that I don't live in Kent,

434
00:22:37,695 --> 00:22:39,615
I live in a box at the Opera,

435
00:22:39,655 --> 00:22:42,112
sneering at the proletariat with
the rest of the toffee-nosed crew.

436
00:22:42,136 --> 00:22:45,816
- This is so totally not the issue.
- Isn't it?

437
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:48,417
We cannot lose this seat, Anna.
Not now.

438
00:22:48,457 --> 00:22:50,897
We're living through some
crazy undeclared war

439
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:53,378
where we don't even know
what the enemy wants.

440
00:22:53,418 --> 00:22:56,579
The whole country is bubbling
with rumors and suspicions

441
00:22:56,659 --> 00:23:00,379
fed by an Internet that we
cannot even begin to compete with.

442
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:02,660
So, I'm sorry,
I'm really fucking sorry

443
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,940
if your liberal sensibilities
have been offended

444
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,461
by a heat of the battle remark
about your precious little friend.

445
00:23:08,581 --> 00:23:10,501
But this is politics,
it's tough.

446
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:13,662
- And it's gonna get tougher.
- They were your sensibilities once, Robert.

447
00:23:13,702 --> 00:23:16,222
Tough shit.
This is now.

448
00:23:16,342 --> 00:23:18,863
If you can't get in line with that...
- Then what?

449
00:23:21,143 --> 00:23:23,424
Then what?

450
00:23:27,145 --> 00:23:28,425
Hello, Anna.

451
00:23:40,907 --> 00:23:42,148
He died?

452
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:06,152
Lin!

453
00:24:11,954 --> 00:24:14,434
Don't bother going in, Tina,
there's none left.

454
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:18,195
You can have a couple
of bottles of mine.

455
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:20,315
- You okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

456
00:24:20,395 --> 00:24:23,636
I'm still drinking tap water, as you
can probably tell by my lizard tail.

457
00:24:23,676 --> 00:24:25,676
Oh, same old Cary.
Everything's a joke.

458
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:29,637
Same old Linda, believe any old
shit she reads on the World Wide Web.

459
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:32,078
- There are kids dying, Cary.
- One kid has died.

460
00:24:32,158 --> 00:24:35,118
- Well, that makes it okay?
- Of course it's not okay.

461
00:24:35,158 --> 00:24:38,479
We weren't always this crazy.
What the hell are we all coming to?

462
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,479
Come on, let's go.

463
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,680
He's not in a good place.

464
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,321
I've never seen him
so paranoid.

465
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:50,321
Or tetchy.

466
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:51,922
His wife?

467
00:24:52,002 --> 00:24:54,442
Both his marriages
are looking shaky.

468
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:59,123
So...

469
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:01,964
I've been speaking to my
equivalent at the American Embassy.

470
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,764
The imagination boggles.
What's he like?

471
00:25:04,884 --> 00:25:07,965
She is a female John Bolton,

472
00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:11,445
who also has a PhD
in geopolitical balancing.

473
00:25:11,486 --> 00:25:14,006
The Americans are very keen
we don't escalate things further.

474
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:19,127
Maybe we should blow up
half of Kentucky in revenge.

475
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:22,488
Things are extremely delicate
in the South China Sea.

476
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:25,728
They think Beijing is about to
make a big, aggressive move.

477
00:25:25,848 --> 00:25:27,769
And you think this may be
connected to all that?

478
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:29,929
I don't know.

479
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:32,690
But I think a cyber war
on a weak country

480
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:37,491
might not even be connected to any
specific thing we did or could control.

481
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:39,411
And that's the terrifying part.

482
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:41,972
We are not weak.

483
00:25:44,652 --> 00:25:48,133
We are significant,
but not sovereign.

484
00:25:51,453 --> 00:25:54,694
In their eyes, sovereign
is being able to survive

485
00:25:54,774 --> 00:25:58,175
without a bigger boy looking
after you, and we can't.

486
00:25:58,255 --> 00:26:01,455
Better go eat worms.

487
00:26:03,736 --> 00:26:06,737
Look, this water situation
is terrifying.

488
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,857
That they can confect
such panic out of nothing.

489
00:26:09,937 --> 00:26:12,978
- The kid died.
- One kid, though.

490
00:26:13,098 --> 00:26:15,938
And God knows
how he actually got it.

491
00:26:16,018 --> 00:26:18,019
The rest is all
smoke and mirrors.

492
00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:23,420
We think an outsourced rogue
nation hit the water supply.

493
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,220
And a Russian hand is
pulling the Firestorm strings.

494
00:26:27,941 --> 00:26:32,542
If we are on our own,
attacked by all sides now,

495
00:26:32,662 --> 00:26:34,702
we need a strong figure
on the bridge.

496
00:26:34,782 --> 00:26:36,983
Not someone
beset by paranoia.

497
00:26:41,704 --> 00:26:45,504
- You never fall out with him.
- I mean, we squabble a bit, but not like this.

498
00:26:45,624 --> 00:26:47,145
Not where he threatens to...

499
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,425
How's everything else?

500
00:26:53,186 --> 00:26:54,626
Everything else?

501
00:26:56,146 --> 00:26:58,627
Well...

502
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:01,668
Hot flashes.

503
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:05,988
Absolute torment.

504
00:27:08,189 --> 00:27:11,429
They should call it
something far worse.

505
00:27:17,951 --> 00:27:20,351
But even that's
not the main thing.

506
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:21,712
What's the main thing?

507
00:27:24,632 --> 00:27:26,993
This just isn't how I
thought I would get old.

508
00:27:34,274 --> 00:27:35,954
I thought it would be graceful.

509
00:27:38,155 --> 00:27:39,635
Dignified.

510
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,156
They keep...

511
00:27:48,437 --> 00:27:51,397
mocking me for being this...

512
00:27:51,477 --> 00:27:55,438
sneering, elitist Brahmin,
and I feel...

513
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,856
I sometimes feel as if I'm
looking at myself and thinking,

514
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,161
"The absolute state
of you, love."

515
00:28:08,201 --> 00:28:11,001
And now, Robert says I
would rather you were elected

516
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:13,202
than our candidate.
And you know what?

517
00:28:13,282 --> 00:28:15,362
He's right.
You would.

518
00:28:15,442 --> 00:28:16,723
I mean, good.

519
00:28:16,803 --> 00:28:18,963
Because Rodger Hawkins
is a weapons-grade prick.

520
00:28:19,003 --> 00:28:21,483
A prick that might lead
to me losing my job.

521
00:28:21,524 --> 00:28:23,004
Come and work for me then.

522
00:28:25,484 --> 00:28:27,245
I saw this thing.

523
00:28:27,365 --> 00:28:29,861
It said that Joseph Obasi was
gonna be the first black Prime Minister.

524
00:28:29,885 --> 00:28:31,445
Yeah, he's a piece of work.

525
00:28:31,485 --> 00:28:33,486
Yeah, he is what he is.

526
00:28:33,566 --> 00:28:35,166
But I thought...

527
00:28:35,206 --> 00:28:37,287
Not on my watch, mate.

528
00:28:37,407 --> 00:28:38,887
I'm taking this all the way.

529
00:28:40,127 --> 00:28:42,208
First black Minister
isn't gonna be a man.

530
00:28:45,408 --> 00:28:48,169
- Just one problem.
- Hmm?

531
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:50,529
You've got to get your party
to accept a woman

532
00:28:50,649 --> 00:28:52,730
as leader first.

533
00:28:56,731 --> 00:28:59,211
You asked me to come
and work for you once.

534
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:02,732
Change your life, Anna.

535
00:29:02,772 --> 00:29:05,452
That party doesn't have room
for people like you any more.

536
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:07,893
Come work with me.

537
00:29:14,814 --> 00:29:16,975
Do not say
you were not warned.

538
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:19,535
They are poisoning the children
with modified water.

539
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:22,456
The sick children have
suffered a rare side effect,

540
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:24,216
and are collateral damage.

541
00:29:24,256 --> 00:29:26,216
Something has been placed
in the water supply

542
00:29:26,296 --> 00:29:28,217
to adjust the minds
of young people

543
00:29:28,297 --> 00:29:30,537
- and make them more susceptible...
- -Oh, God!

544
00:29:30,657 --> 00:29:33,378
This will get
my sister-in-law going.

545
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:36,178
You know what you have to do.

546
00:29:36,218 --> 00:29:38,379
Fight fire with fire.

547
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:40,259
You know what the targets are.

548
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:43,980
A thousand sparks
create a firestorm.

549
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:08,665
Yeah, that's it!

550
00:30:14,706 --> 00:30:17,707
We don't want
your fake drugs.

551
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:31,389
Burn it down!

552
00:30:31,469 --> 00:30:34,230
Burn it down, burn it down.

553
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:39,031
Burn it down.

554
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:42,592
Don't do this.
It's madness.

555
00:30:42,712 --> 00:30:44,752
Please, come home.

556
00:30:44,832 --> 00:30:47,473
For fuck's sake,
stop it, Lin.

557
00:30:56,835 --> 00:31:00,915
Tina, stop it.
This has to stop. Now!

558
00:31:01,996 --> 00:31:03,236
I'm scared.

559
00:31:03,276 --> 00:31:05,076
I know.

560
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,677
I'm so sick of it.
I'm so sick of being scared.

561
00:31:09,597 --> 00:31:10,997
I don't want Danny to die.

562
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,078
He's at home in his bedroom,
on his PlayStation.

563
00:31:13,198 --> 00:31:14,918
He's not going to die.

564
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,479
Your hands.

565
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,480
I love you.

566
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,240
That's all we need,
isn't it?

567
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,961
B side “Baby you're a Rich Man”"

568
00:31:29,001 --> 00:31:32,522
I told you
not to drink that water.

569
00:31:34,442 --> 00:31:36,002
Take me home.

570
00:31:52,446 --> 00:31:54,766
Have you seen the TV? They're
burning things down in Kent.

571
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,047
It's like anarchy.
It's really scary.

572
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:00,727
What the fuck
you even doing?

573
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:02,568
One:
Don't swear at me.

574
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:05,568
Two: Don't say
"even" in that context.

575
00:32:05,688 --> 00:32:08,569
Three: Don't put crap
like this in the window.

576
00:32:08,689 --> 00:32:11,570
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Don't you "wait" me.

577
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,530
Quantum fucking algorithm.

578
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,770
It doesn't mean anything!

579
00:32:17,611 --> 00:32:20,011
They've burned down
Francine's election offices in Kent.

580
00:32:20,091 --> 00:32:22,732
So what? The planet's
been burning for long enough.

581
00:32:22,772 --> 00:32:24,772
All the political parties
are the same.

582
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:27,173
Maybe people
will listen for a change.

583
00:32:32,294 --> 00:32:34,054
This is completely insane.

584
00:32:37,775 --> 00:32:40,295
Serious arson attacks
in Kent overnight.

585
00:32:40,415 --> 00:32:44,736
Shops, especially chemists',
and a couple of GP surgeries.

586
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:47,777
Local government buildings.
Even a few police stations.

587
00:32:47,857 --> 00:32:49,497
Phone masts
were also attacked.

588
00:32:49,537 --> 00:32:52,738
The casualties, largely in flats
above properties, stand at five.

589
00:32:52,778 --> 00:32:56,178
And all this was achieved with
lies about Quantum Algorithm?

590
00:32:56,258 --> 00:32:58,019
All the main news outlets

591
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,779
have carried reports that
the water is safe, but, uh...

592
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:02,580
people are still
burning things.

593
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,540
There's something deep rooted
in the national psyche

594
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,861
when it comes to arson.

595
00:33:06,981 --> 00:33:09,581
I'm sure it gets
the dopamine flying.

596
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:12,862
There's a Firestorm meme
doing the rounds.

597
00:33:12,982 --> 00:33:14,182
I've seen it.

598
00:33:14,262 --> 00:33:16,422
Our candidate in Kent
has retreated it.

599
00:33:16,502 --> 00:33:19,023
In an attempt...
- Tell him to delete that immediately.

600
00:33:19,103 --> 00:33:20,503
We have.

601
00:33:20,543 --> 00:33:22,544
He's, so far,
failed to respond.

602
00:33:22,624 --> 00:33:25,104
That tiger ride's
going smoothly then.

603
00:33:30,065 --> 00:33:34,186
Seriously, he's posting stuff
probably spread by a hostile force.

604
00:33:34,266 --> 00:33:36,506
Not very local, is it?

605
00:33:37,867 --> 00:33:40,707
She's right.
It's definitely an attack line.

606
00:33:42,508 --> 00:33:44,068
I'll deal with it.

607
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,868
Can I posit a scenario?

608
00:33:45,988 --> 00:33:48,309
What happens if he goes so
far that we have to suspend him?

609
00:33:49,189 --> 00:33:52,030
It's too late
to nominate another candidate.

610
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,950
This is the masterplan,
then, is it?

611
00:33:57,311 --> 00:33:59,231
We have to stop this.

612
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:02,792
But no more revenge attacks
on banks and assets though.

613
00:34:02,872 --> 00:34:06,392
That, clearly,
has just fed the beast.

614
00:34:06,472 --> 00:34:09,433
The Americans have made it clear...
- Fuck the Americans.

615
00:34:09,513 --> 00:34:13,874
They're probably watching this shit
show with as much interest as anyone else.

616
00:34:13,954 --> 00:34:15,954
Organize a press conference
for 4:00 p.m.

617
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:20,115
Time to go public with who we think is
behind this. We present a collegiate face.

618
00:34:21,836 --> 00:34:25,516
I think the Home Secretary would
be better in the circumstances.

619
00:34:28,517 --> 00:34:30,237
Fine, we'll do
a joint conference.

620
00:34:48,561 --> 00:34:50,321
Rodger.

621
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:54,642
- Ever been in the Foreign Office, Rog?
- Can't say I have.

622
00:34:54,722 --> 00:34:56,963
Splendid, isn't it?

623
00:34:57,043 --> 00:35:00,083
Fruitier than
Carmen Miranda hat.

624
00:35:01,323 --> 00:35:04,564
Now I need you to do me
a bit of a favor.

625
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,685
- What's that?
- Stop being a cunt.

626
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,245
- I'm sorry.
- Big ask, I know.

627
00:35:10,365 --> 00:35:12,926
You see, it doesn't matter
if a crypto-communist

628
00:35:13,006 --> 00:35:15,886
like Anna Marshall doesn't
care for you. That's a given.

629
00:35:15,966 --> 00:35:20,127
But if you lose Jo Obasi,
you're on shaky ground.

630
00:35:20,207 --> 00:35:21,768
I think I can handle him.

631
00:35:21,888 --> 00:35:23,208
- Do you now?
- I do.

632
00:35:23,328 --> 00:35:26,929
Yes, but thanks for the advice,
Archie, all the same.

633
00:35:28,889 --> 00:35:31,770
Well, look, let me float
a different scenario.

634
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,210
What do you think happens
if you lose me?

635
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:39,571
The Home Secretary asked
you to delete the meme.

636
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:41,772
So, delete the meme.

637
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:45,572
It's not an endorsement,
I just like it.

638
00:35:45,612 --> 00:35:48,053
It's garbage, but that's
neither here nor there.

639
00:35:48,093 --> 00:35:51,854
Delete the meme
and apologize.

640
00:35:51,934 --> 00:35:55,214
No wonder people say
you're a spent force.

641
00:35:56,935 --> 00:35:58,335
People say that, eh?

642
00:35:59,775 --> 00:36:01,535
Have you ever heard that

643
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,216
when you're racing the
dawn back to the crypt, Motty?

644
00:36:04,336 --> 00:36:07,537
No. I mean, I've heard you called
lots of things, Archie, but not that.

645
00:36:07,577 --> 00:36:10,057
Be sure to tell me if you do.

646
00:36:12,538 --> 00:36:14,698
Would you care
to put it to the test?

647
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:18,699
What's your game, Rodger?

648
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:21,459
My game?

649
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:25,900
I would really advise you not
to play with matches, my friend.

650
00:36:27,581 --> 00:36:30,101
But I'm not your friend,
Archie.

651
00:36:41,543 --> 00:36:43,104
He's not going to delete it.

652
00:36:45,104 --> 00:36:47,865
- Maybe Anna is right.
- What?

653
00:36:47,945 --> 00:36:50,385
Call Division 45.
Archie's been hacked.

654
00:36:53,706 --> 00:36:55,146
Why did you forgo
the opportunity

655
00:36:55,226 --> 00:36:57,587
to appear on the podium
alongside the PM later?

656
00:36:57,667 --> 00:36:59,267
I have to go to Scotland.

657
00:36:59,387 --> 00:37:01,227
It's not like you
to shun the limelight.

658
00:37:01,347 --> 00:37:03,084
What are you scheming at now,
you crafty old...

659
00:37:03,108 --> 00:37:05,548
It is the anniversary
of my son's death.

660
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:09,709
Marianne and I always go
to the site to lay a wreath.

661
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:16,871
- I didn't know.
- Because I don't talk about it much.

662
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:21,151
He was on a Royal Marines
live-fire training exercise.

663
00:37:23,512 --> 00:37:24,872
Nobody's fault.

664
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:30,113
But anyway... Stephen died.

665
00:37:32,194 --> 00:37:33,714
I'm very sorry.

666
00:37:37,515 --> 00:37:38,875
Yes, it was sad.

667
00:37:41,796 --> 00:37:43,756
Keep an eye on his social media

668
00:37:43,876 --> 00:37:46,797
because I can
definitely smell smoke

669
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:49,797
rising from under
Rodger Hawkins' feet.

670
00:38:13,722 --> 00:38:15,002
What's going on?

671
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,883
- Security says you're...
- I have to go.

672
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:22,084
- I can't stay or I will go insane.
- Go where?

673
00:38:22,164 --> 00:38:24,244
I'm going to go
and visit Ellie in Chile.

674
00:38:24,364 --> 00:38:27,165
- No, no, no. Chile's not safe.
- Why not?

675
00:38:27,245 --> 00:38:29,965
Rob, some of those arsonists were
wearing masks with my face on them.

676
00:38:30,045 --> 00:38:31,926
Wicked Witch T-shirts, it...

677
00:38:34,886 --> 00:38:37,887
We're gonna go horse-riding in
the Andes, and, you know, just...

678
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:40,247
You, Ellie
and the Anarchist.

679
00:38:40,367 --> 00:38:42,048
It's like the High Chaparral.

680
00:38:44,648 --> 00:38:46,528
The Anarchist
is ancient history.

681
00:38:46,609 --> 00:38:48,969
And nobody remembers
the High Chaparral.

682
00:38:49,049 --> 00:38:50,209
I do.

683
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:02,252
It was...

684
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:05,652
Anna's suggestion, actually.
And suddenly I thought...

685
00:39:05,732 --> 00:39:07,253
You spoke to Anna?

686
00:39:07,373 --> 00:39:10,093
- Yeah. She suggested going to visit Ellie just to...
- What?

687
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:12,294
What?
It's a sensible idea...

688
00:39:12,414 --> 00:39:14,654
You talked to Anna
before me?

689
00:39:14,734 --> 00:39:17,735
- Yeah, but it wasn't like that.
- Oh, this is great.

690
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:19,615
This really is revenge.

691
00:39:20,575 --> 00:39:22,616
Well, you got to hand it to her,

692
00:39:22,656 --> 00:39:24,656
she knows how to stab
from every direction.

693
00:39:24,736 --> 00:39:26,817
Rob, no, we were
just talking, and...

694
00:39:26,937 --> 00:39:28,937
I've lost her loyalty.
It's gone.

695
00:39:30,297 --> 00:39:34,178
All because I reinstated Archie
and overruled her on Hawkins.

696
00:39:35,698 --> 00:39:38,099
She's a fucking mole.

697
00:39:38,139 --> 00:39:40,819
She's working for them.
For the opposition.

698
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,180
So, as we await
government press conference

699
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,501
on the wave
of arson attacks last night,

700
00:39:47,581 --> 00:39:51,541
I can confirm that Rodger Hawkins,
the Conservative candidate in Kent,

701
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:56,062
has not deleted a tweet associated
with the Firestorm campaign.

702
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,903
And in a move likely to deeply
embarrass the Prime Minister,

703
00:39:58,983 --> 00:40:03,784
he has also said he will not be
drinking tap water as a precaution.

704
00:40:11,105 --> 00:40:14,586
- Hawkins is going to flip on us.
- I think you're right.

705
00:40:20,467 --> 00:40:23,108
That was a good point earlier.

706
00:40:23,148 --> 00:40:26,588
About the opposition using
the attack line against us.

707
00:40:26,629 --> 00:40:30,669
Anyone might think that was
something you did in your spare time.

708
00:40:30,749 --> 00:40:32,286
Don't worry,
if I were going to do that,

709
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,126
I would make sure that
I was handsomely paid for it.

710
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,991
- Don't ever speak to my wife again.
- What?

711
00:40:38,151 --> 00:40:42,712
Um, shall we discuss
how we parcel this out?

712
00:40:45,992 --> 00:40:49,193
- I think you need to lead...
- No, no, it's okay, Anna, we have this.

713
00:40:49,273 --> 00:40:51,674
Why don't you just go off
and leak to Francine...

714
00:40:51,754 --> 00:40:53,994
- What?
- Fidelity.

715
00:40:54,074 --> 00:40:56,154
It never was your
strong suit, was it?

716
00:40:59,755 --> 00:41:00,955
Fuck you, Robert.

717
00:41:01,035 --> 00:41:03,036
- You're fired.
- No, I resign.

718
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:22,120
Cerberus.

719
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,440
You know what that means,
don't you?

720
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,521
The multi-headed dog that
stands at the gates of hell.

721
00:41:28,601 --> 00:41:31,521
Get me the Prime Minister
immediately.

722
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:33,482
He's about to do
the news conference.

723
00:41:33,562 --> 00:41:34,962
Stop him.

724
00:41:37,443 --> 00:41:39,603
Get the Prime Minister.

725
00:42:05,768 --> 00:42:07,169
Good afternoon, everyone.

726
00:42:41,215 --> 00:42:43,776
Justice for Simon.
Vote nobody.

727
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:45,656
Hit back harder.

728
00:42:47,977 --> 00:42:51,057
I have to go,
or I will go insane.

729
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:56,298
She's a fucking mole.

730
00:42:56,418 --> 00:42:59,139
- Fuck you, Robert!
- I resign!
