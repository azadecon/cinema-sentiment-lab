1
00:00:28,505 --> 00:00:30,385
This one will give a red alarm.

2
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:33,985
Medical isotopes,

3
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:36,105
all standard. Don't fret.

4
00:00:42,986 --> 00:00:45,586
- Sir?
- Hmm?

5
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,826
- It isn't.
- What?

6
00:00:47,906 --> 00:00:49,267
Giving a red, sir.

7
00:00:49,347 --> 00:00:52,547
The cargo's bloody radioactive,
it's got to give a red.

8
00:01:00,468 --> 00:01:03,188
Christ. The whole system's down.

9
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:05,668
Get the Senior. Now!

10
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:09,189
Mr. Sutherland is already under
pressure to declare an inquiry into

11
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,029
whether exploratory gas-field drilling by
the Chinese mining conglomerate Jiayóu

12
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:15,629
might have played a role in
disturbing the buried munitions ship

13
00:01:15,669 --> 00:01:18,670
which caused such
devastating tragedy in Kent.

14
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,550
And of course, Mr. Sutherland is
also facing demands for answers...

15
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,950
Anna, Eleanor has an emergency
briefing for us on the ports.

16
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,031
...of Ukrainian businessman
Mikhailo Kostenko.

17
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:30,391
So perhaps, it's not
particularly surprising

18
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:34,191
that the exoneration of the government
over the J23 shootings in the Singer Report

19
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:38,312
is being met with significant
skepticism from various quarters.

20
00:01:38,392 --> 00:01:42,392
Earlier, I spoke to the leader of
the opposition, Chris Edwards.

21
00:01:42,472 --> 00:01:45,552
The Lord Singer report
is a disgraceful attempt

22
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:49,593
to give the illusion of transparency and
credibility to a desperate Tory government,

23
00:01:49,673 --> 00:01:52,313
which frankly, has demonstrated
neither, and which knows

24
00:01:52,393 --> 00:01:56,393
it is losing the trust of the
British people by the day.

25
00:01:56,473 --> 00:01:58,394
- Robert?
- Chris Edwards there,

26
00:01:58,474 --> 00:02:01,474
and we'll have more on that
story later on this afternoon.

27
00:02:05,674 --> 00:02:07,834
When we're done here,
we need to discuss candidates.

28
00:02:07,955 --> 00:02:10,051
- There's the Kent by-election...
- That's hardly pressing.

29
00:02:10,075 --> 00:02:13,555
Even so, if you have preferences, what
is pressing, and actually bloody urgent...

30
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,395
- Foreign Secretary?
- Precisely.

31
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:18,836
And I assumed under the
circumstances, the last thing you'd want

32
00:02:18,956 --> 00:02:20,836
- is a reshuffle, so...
- Archie.

33
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,116
- Is that a joke?
- Not the time.

34
00:02:26,836 --> 00:02:29,277
- It's a wrong decision.
- The man's a...

35
00:02:29,837 --> 00:02:31,557
Duly noted.

36
00:02:36,517 --> 00:02:39,398
We had to close
the Port of Dover an hour ago,

37
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:43,118
when it became apparent the Cyclamen
scanners had been incapacitated.

38
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:46,398
- Cyclamen?
- -The huge fixed scanners at every UK port

39
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:49,399
and airport to detect
radioactive freight.

40
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,559
Cyclamen is our frontline defense against
the smuggling of nuclear contraband.

41
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:57,960
Which is our only net to catch terrorists
driving a dirty bomb into the country.

42
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,640
We've ascertained that the
total system failure at Dover

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,240
is the result of a massive
ongoing cyber-attack.

44
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,120
So, who's doing this?

45
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,280
Is it part of
the Ruin Britannia hack?

46
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,561
I am currently unable
to provide an assessment.

47
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:14,281
We've identified none of the same hallmarks
as yet, but it could be the same group.

48
00:03:14,401 --> 00:03:19,282
But until our capacity for monitoring
nuclear material is back online,

49
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:21,242
we can't let
anyone through.

50
00:03:21,282 --> 00:03:23,882
So far, Dover's the
only port affected, right?

51
00:03:23,962 --> 00:03:25,962
- No other border-point?
- So far.

52
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:29,003
Nonetheless, Dover's
critical for supply-chains.

53
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:32,803
Sealing it for any length of
time risks massive disruption.

54
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:37,003
- How quickly can it be unsealed?
- -GCHQ have three teams on it.

55
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:40,684
- But I'm afraid at the moment...
- You are unable to provide an assessment?

56
00:03:40,724 --> 00:03:43,564
At what point are we going to
have to deal with shortages?

57
00:03:43,684 --> 00:03:46,644
The immediate
concern is fresh produce.

58
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,805
We've already
instigated contingencies, but...

59
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:53,005
the closure of a major port's going
to be all over the lunchtime news,

60
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:56,885
and even if we don't
face a supply crisis...

61
00:03:56,965 --> 00:03:58,566
We'll face panic-buying.

62
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,686
People are people.

63
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:06,246
Well, we can be front-footed
to head off panic.

64
00:04:06,286 --> 00:04:08,967
What I find deeply disturbing

65
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:10,887
is that, if it weren't
for a lucky catch,

66
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:13,327
we could be hunting
for a dirty bomb.

67
00:04:13,407 --> 00:04:15,007
I'm afraid we, um...

68
00:04:17,327 --> 00:04:19,888
We can't yet
be totally certain.

69
00:04:20,568 --> 00:04:22,448
There was a window

70
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:27,208
between the system failing and the
Border Force realizing it was down.

71
00:04:27,288 --> 00:04:29,009
How big a window?

72
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:30,409
Five hours.

73
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:36,849
During which, 1,027 vehicles
passed through Cyclamen

74
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:40,010
- without an accurate scan.
- Jesus Christ!

75
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,450
I've already initiated
a situation room.

76
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,890
We need to issue a statement
about the closure.

77
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,331
About the closure,
yes. Nothing else.

78
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:52,331
The priority must be
to maintain public calm.

79
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:55,091
I want these vehicles
found and scanned.

80
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,891
I want the cyber-attack
neutralized. I want to know where it,

81
00:04:57,972 --> 00:05:00,132
where all of these attacks
have come from.

82
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:03,652
And I want that port open again
before there's riots in Tesco.

83
00:05:22,094 --> 00:05:23,694
Hey.

84
00:05:23,774 --> 00:05:25,854
- Is this all of them?
- Uh-huh.

85
00:05:25,894 --> 00:05:29,095
Every vehicle which entered while Cyclamen
was down, clustered by destination.

86
00:05:29,135 --> 00:05:31,015
We've issued regional forces
with a full alert.

87
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:33,335
All right, but we also
need to group by origin.

88
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:35,855
Yep, which is in this array.

89
00:05:35,895 --> 00:05:37,535
Always one step ahead.

90
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:41,016
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

91
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:43,536
It's just...

92
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,872
- I didn't expect you back to work so soon...
- I said I'm fine.

93
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:51,217
The doctors said I'm fine, I want to
work, and you are not my real dad.

94
00:05:51,337 --> 00:05:54,457
We're running every point of origin
against the Foreign Office's risk index.

95
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:56,977
Then we sort the
vehicles by potential threat.

96
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:00,898
What?

97
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:03,298
With a cyber attack on our
nuclear scanners, I'm just

98
00:06:03,338 --> 00:06:07,858
forcing myself not to dwell on
what the word “threat” means today.

99
00:06:07,898 --> 00:06:10,899
I just think there are more
pressing needs on our attention.

100
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,859
Well, I'm afraid I think the
appointment of a Foreign Secretary

101
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:16,459
- is about as pressing as it gets.
- I'm not prepared to...

102
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:18,460
To what? To listen to reason?

103
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,900
Bad enough you give Archie back
the whip, but Foreign Secretary?

104
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,140
You may think it throws
a bone to the fringe right,

105
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,460
but all it's going to do
is make them hungrier.

106
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,861
They'll smell weakness on you.

107
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:32,701
Is that what you smell?

108
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:39,222
Look. My only
concern here is...

109
00:06:39,342 --> 00:06:42,862
- Yes.
- -Mr Glover-Morgan, Prime Minister.

110
00:06:45,462 --> 00:06:46,662
Send him in.

111
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:51,223
Who looks weak, Anna?

112
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:54,903
The man who waves the bone,
or the dog who comes drooling?

113
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:58,344
It's a question of
who bites whom first.

114
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:04,024
- Anna! How delightful...
- Fuck off.

115
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:08,025
I've always said she brings
such warmth to the workplace.

116
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:11,465
Black, no sugar as I recall.

117
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,025
I know you're
a busy man, Robert.

118
00:07:14,105 --> 00:07:18,106
What, with the country
coming apart at the seams.

119
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,786
So, why the tummy-tickle?

120
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:23,146
Think of it more as a...

121
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:26,586
civility towards a
potential cabinet colleague.

122
00:07:27,426 --> 00:07:29,547
Then never mind the tummy.

123
00:07:31,587 --> 00:07:34,907
- I'm all ears.
- I'm offering you Foreign Secretary.

124
00:07:36,027 --> 00:07:38,908
As I recall, when
I suggested as much,

125
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:42,868
- you scoffed.
- This country is under attack, Archie.

126
00:07:42,908 --> 00:07:45,108
I'm on the verge
of a War Cabinet.

127
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:49,029
Bask all you like, but I need
experienced comrades.

128
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:50,349
Comrades, indeed.

129
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:52,469
Personal sentiments
are immaterial,

130
00:07:52,549 --> 00:07:55,109
as regards my duty
to provide this country

131
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:58,550
with its best possible
government. One in which you

132
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,350
would be a
most valued asset.

133
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,030
Then I suppose,

134
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,110
since duty calls,

135
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:09,591
I must accept.

136
00:08:34,273 --> 00:08:35,913
Jessie?

137
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:39,154
- Did you see who delivered this?
- It was just with the other post.

138
00:08:39,274 --> 00:08:41,314
No stamp, no postmark.

139
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:45,154
It was hand-delivered,
but you didn't see who?

140
00:08:58,156 --> 00:09:01,436
Intel flagged it
immediately. Origin: Ukraine.

141
00:09:01,556 --> 00:09:03,156
Ukraine's risk-index
was elevated to high

142
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,796
after the assassination
of Mikhailo Kostenko.

143
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:09,797
The truck's cargo manifest states
“Produce,” but the haulage firm

144
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,317
has never exported
to the UK before.

145
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:14,677
Is this our potential threat?

146
00:09:14,757 --> 00:09:16,677
MI5 are calling
maximum priority.

147
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:19,278
If we have to evacuate,
what sort of numbers?

148
00:09:19,318 --> 00:09:23,318
Vehicle's almost at destination,
industrial park outside of Nottingham.

149
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,838
It's sparse,
only half occupied.

150
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:28,559
Small mercies.

151
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:55,561
Cut the engine, sir.

152
00:09:57,761 --> 00:10:00,442
Tell them to keep
the public away, please.

153
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:42,966
Confirmed presence
of irradiated mass.

154
00:10:43,046 --> 00:10:45,686
Registering high levels
of beta-ray emission,

155
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:47,686
some measurable
gamma-ray emission.

156
00:10:56,807 --> 00:10:59,448
What are they doing there?

157
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:03,328
I said keep
the public away, please!

158
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:21,690
Profile suggests probable
presence of caesium-137,

159
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,050
and...

160
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,530
What the fuck?

161
00:11:28,931 --> 00:11:31,291
Berries?

162
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:35,331
Repeat. Cargo appears
to be radioactive berries.

163
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:40,452
Get those crates opened and
check for anything concealed.

164
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:43,692
The berries were
ordered by a wholesaler

165
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:47,172
whose regular provider was
unable to deliver on time,

166
00:11:47,212 --> 00:11:52,053
on account of the massively reduced
transit across the Channel. But...

167
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:53,933
what the wholesaler
didn't realize

168
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:56,933
is that the berries
were grown in Polesia.

169
00:11:56,973 --> 00:11:58,814
A region of Ukraine.

170
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:02,814
- Technically, outside the Exclusion Zone, but...
- "Exclusion"?

171
00:12:02,934 --> 00:12:04,574
Of Chernobyl.

172
00:12:04,654 --> 00:12:07,214
The soil there
is still irradiated.

173
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:10,935
The cargo has been quarantined.
It'll be safely destroyed.

174
00:12:11,695 --> 00:12:14,095
Even so, if this gets out,

175
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:16,215
years of pleading
with the public

176
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,056
to eat their five-a-day
straight down the crapper.

177
00:12:19,176 --> 00:12:22,336
We believe the nature
of the cargo is secure,

178
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,296
but phone footage
of the truck, police,

179
00:12:25,336 --> 00:12:27,696
military, may soon
be in the wild.

180
00:12:27,816 --> 00:12:31,177
So we simply state that the government
doesn't comment on security matters.

181
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:34,537
Which makes it clear as day
there's a “security matter.”

182
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:36,817
Then slap the press
with a D-notice.

183
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,578
These days, we call them
"DSMA-Notices,"

184
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:43,338
should you wish to update your
frames of reference from 1945.

185
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,698
We'll have to
say something, surely.

186
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:48,699
If there's footage,
it's bound to get out.

187
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:50,939
Robert, you said yourself,
we need to be front-footed.

188
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:54,939
I said our primary concern should
be neutralizing fear and panic.

189
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:56,579
I agree with Archie.

190
00:12:56,699 --> 00:12:59,060
We don't comment on it.
We give them something else,

191
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,340
such as telling them when
the port will reopen. So...

192
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,860
When will the port reopen?

193
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,981
- Hopefully, within 24 hours.
- "Hopefully"?

194
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:14,781
With respect, I think we were all hoping
for something a little less wishy-washy.

195
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,462
And how many more
trucks left to scan?

196
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:21,302
Before we're at least
through that crisis.

197
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,862
Four hundred and seventy.

198
00:13:26,462 --> 00:13:27,462
Get to work.

199
00:13:36,663 --> 00:13:38,584
Of course
I want back in.

200
00:13:38,704 --> 00:13:41,864
But I'd just sooner run for a
seat I've got a chance of winning.

201
00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:44,544
Well, before Clive Turner
won it, that seat was Labor's.

202
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:46,040
What's stopping it
from being Labor again?

203
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:48,065
I'm a black woman,
and apparently, a member of...

204
00:13:48,185 --> 00:13:52,305
- What are we called now? The liberal London elite.
- Right.

205
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:55,825
Well, I'd suggest that your opinion that the
electorate are a bunch of racist bumpkins

206
00:13:55,945 --> 00:13:58,066
is something we maybe
leave off the pamphlets, but...

207
00:13:58,186 --> 00:14:01,066
- Okay, that's not what I meant.
- I know what you meant.

208
00:14:01,186 --> 00:14:03,946
But you don't believe it any
more than I do. You're just...

209
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:06,466
- You're just gun-shy.
- "Gun-shy"?

210
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:08,347
Yes, it's been a while
since you campaigned.

211
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:10,187
- How dare you...
- No, I mean it. Listen,

212
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,683
I'll tell you exactly why I think
you can win the by-election.

213
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:16,667
Right now, that constituency is
shell-shocked and it's flooded.

214
00:14:16,707 --> 00:14:20,068
Why? Because the Tories have flogged
our gas-fields to a Chinese multinational

215
00:14:20,188 --> 00:14:23,164
- which caused an explosion.
- I thought the drilling thing hadn't been proven yet.

216
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:26,348
Yeah, but why have they rescinded
the contract? Now, if that wasn't enough,

217
00:14:26,428 --> 00:14:29,069
Dover Port is shut.

218
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:31,165
Total chaos, by the sound
of things, massive tailbacks,

219
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:35,789
right on the doorstep of
the very same constituency.

220
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:38,430
Due to some sort of
system failure.

221
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,550
Why? Because the Tories have grotesquely
underinvested in infrastructure.

222
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,070
Now, if you lived there...

223
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,790
would you not be
ready for change?

224
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,471
Listen, I tell you what.

225
00:14:57,191 --> 00:15:00,432
Why don't we just
sketch out, just hypothetically,

226
00:15:00,472 --> 00:15:01,992
some sort of

227
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:03,832
strategy.

228
00:15:05,952 --> 00:15:08,553
Might be able to get a whiff of
who the other side are fielding.

229
00:15:08,593 --> 00:15:10,713
And how are we going to do that?

230
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,953
Well, you know
Anna Marshall, don't you?

231
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:16,313
You know full bloody well
we haven't spoken in months.

232
00:15:16,353 --> 00:15:19,434
I'm not going to reach out to her now
just so I can milk her for information.

233
00:15:29,715 --> 00:15:31,115
What's up, Mum?

234
00:15:31,195 --> 00:15:34,595
Uh, nothing really,
I just wanted to check in.

235
00:15:34,675 --> 00:15:36,435
Not dying, are you?

236
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:38,316
Very funny.

237
00:15:38,356 --> 00:15:40,876
Are you at home for supper? I
thought we could get a takeaway.

238
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:43,076
Uh, I'm going to Dad's.

239
00:15:44,796 --> 00:15:46,076
Oh, okay.

240
00:15:46,116 --> 00:15:48,477
- Well, I'll...
- I've got to go, um...

241
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:50,837
Oh, wait. Um...

242
00:15:50,957 --> 00:15:55,077
Is there something weird going
on with, like, fruit or something?

243
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,078
- What?
- Um, before you called, um,

244
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:01,598
someone on Twitch got it off
4chan or something.

245
00:16:01,678 --> 00:16:03,878
Saying like the police
found a load of,

246
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,358
- poisoned berries or something, and I...
- Uh, there's nothing, darling.

247
00:16:07,438 --> 00:16:09,879
And you know 4chan's
for pedos and Hitler Youth.

248
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,119
Look, I've gotta go. Love you.

249
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:38,322
For fuck's sake!

250
00:16:38,362 --> 00:16:41,002
You wanted to see a shortlist
of my preferred candidates,

251
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:43,482
and now you have one.
I don't see the problem.

252
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:46,442
Except for all of them being on
the hard right of the hard right?

253
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:48,603
And Roger Hawkins?
For Christ's sake!

254
00:16:48,723 --> 00:16:52,203
You want to restore the whip
to Roger Hawkins?

255
00:16:52,323 --> 00:16:55,299
Who else in the People's Justice
Independents are you intending to bribe back?

256
00:16:55,323 --> 00:16:57,963
- Our party must be a broad church, Anna.
- Robert, don't!

257
00:16:58,003 --> 00:16:59,844
We both know bloody well
what this is about.

258
00:16:59,924 --> 00:17:02,124
You're afraid of losing
Clive Turner's constituency,

259
00:17:02,244 --> 00:17:06,124
and you think one of these embarrassing
cretins will galvanize the angry white vote.

260
00:17:06,244 --> 00:17:10,765
A vote is a vote, a seat is a
seat, and politics requires power.

261
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:13,445
Now I've told you before, Anna,
you were always an Archangel...

262
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:17,925
Don't throw your bloody utilitarianism
textbook at me again, because this

263
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:21,006
is realpolitik.

264
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:23,086
- And it's grubby, Robert.
- Anna...

265
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,926
This is not our conservatism.

266
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:27,326
Maybe you haven't
noticed, but right now,

267
00:17:27,366 --> 00:17:31,247
from every direction, we are
facing a different storm.

268
00:17:31,327 --> 00:17:35,047
One of which is the distrust
surrounding the Singer Report.

269
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:39,048
Now, who better to vouch for that
report than the former Home Secretary?

270
00:17:39,088 --> 00:17:41,528
So convinced
of that report's integrity

271
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:44,688
that he has
rescinded his resignation.

272
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:50,169
Now, look. You don't like
Archie, Archie doesn't like you.

273
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:53,089
But I suggest you stop letting
your personal grievance...

274
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:55,609
My what? How dare you!

275
00:18:10,371 --> 00:18:12,171
You're right. I detest Archie.

276
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:16,371
But I have never let any “personal
grievance” warp my judgment.

277
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:19,772
And my judgment is you're a
fool if you think you can trust him,

278
00:18:19,852 --> 00:18:24,132
because he will be waiting with a polished
knife the moment your back is turned.

279
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,060
Apologies for dragging you
from your IT crowd.

280
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,061
Not at all, Foreign Secretary.
What could be less important

281
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:52,661
- than the security...
- Of the nation, yes, precisely.

282
00:19:52,781 --> 00:19:55,861
However, while this
cyber-assault is unconscionable,

283
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:58,942
we are currently
fire-fighting on multiple fronts.

284
00:19:59,062 --> 00:20:03,302
And I intend to face them
with a big gushing hose.

285
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:06,558
- He's over-compensating.
- You hardly need to explain that to the Head of Intelligence.

286
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:09,303
Well, here's something I
apparently do need to explain.

287
00:20:09,383 --> 00:20:12,863
We are lumbering towards a
diplomatic crisis with the Chinese

288
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:16,023
over the explosion
in Kent. Peter.

289
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:21,544
The Chinese mining company,
of course, flatly denies

290
00:20:21,624 --> 00:20:26,424
that the explosion was the
result of them sticking their drill-bit

291
00:20:26,544 --> 00:20:29,625
into our Great British Seabed.

292
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:32,185
Meanwhile,

293
00:20:32,305 --> 00:20:35,465
an editorial in
yesterday's Central Times.

294
00:20:35,585 --> 00:20:39,906
I'll save you the trouble of
reading the appalling translation.

295
00:20:40,026 --> 00:20:43,346
It says the British want to
blame the Chinese

296
00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:45,586
to cover up
our own incompetence

297
00:20:45,626 --> 00:20:48,587
at not defusing
the ship years ago.

298
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:52,267
And it is calling
for “a retaliation,

299
00:20:52,347 --> 00:20:55,787
both public and painful.”

300
00:20:55,867 --> 00:20:59,108
I've received a formal complaint
from the Chinese ambassador,

301
00:20:59,188 --> 00:21:01,548
whom I am obliged to meet.

302
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:03,708
And when I do so,
I want a full deck,

303
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:06,708
vis-à-vis who or what
caused the explosion.

304
00:21:06,828 --> 00:21:09,549
I want evidence.
Understood?

305
00:21:09,629 --> 00:21:11,669
All our assets are trying...

306
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:15,165
Are they more reliable than the assets you
employed for that briefing on the Russians?

307
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:18,670
Because from what I can gather,
their usefulness

308
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:23,110
was several thousand degrees
south of sub-optimal.

309
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:26,390
- Minister, with respect...
- I don't want Chinese whispers.

310
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,151
As I say...

311
00:21:29,111 --> 00:21:31,391
a full deck.

312
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,151
A big hose.

313
00:21:40,712 --> 00:21:44,352
Fraser? You need
to look at this.

314
00:21:44,392 --> 00:21:47,592
So, after the blueberries,
what's next on the menu?

315
00:21:47,632 --> 00:21:49,393
Strontium sausages?

316
00:21:49,473 --> 00:21:51,633
- Plutonium pomegranates?
- One of the vehicles,

317
00:21:51,673 --> 00:21:53,633
something's just off
with its data.

318
00:21:53,673 --> 00:21:57,473
I can't find any trace of the haulier.
Now, it might be human error, but...

319
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:01,394
Get it to Eleanor James.

320
00:22:33,397 --> 00:22:34,877
Hello, stranger.

321
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:41,958
I'm glad you called.

322
00:22:43,678 --> 00:22:45,718
I've missed you.

323
00:22:46,638 --> 00:22:48,359
That's good to hear.

324
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:55,119
Say it.

325
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:56,839
I'll think about it.

326
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,080
Can I ask you something?

327
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,200
Business?

328
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,121
Then let's get it out of the way
before the second bottle.

329
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:11,401
Chris Edwards wants me
back in parliament.

330
00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:15,561
- I want you back in parliament.
- He wants me to run for Clive Turner's seat.

331
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:18,122
Pack your snorkel.

332
00:23:18,202 --> 00:23:20,722
Oh, my God,
I'm a horrible person!

333
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:25,562
Nah, there are worse. I mean, to
be fair, they're all in your party, but...

334
00:23:28,443 --> 00:23:30,963
Anna, who are your lot
putting up for the seat?

335
00:23:35,203 --> 00:23:38,284
Is that what this is about?

336
00:23:38,364 --> 00:23:40,924
- Why you called.
- If it was, I would've been much more subtle.

337
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:45,404
Or your expert guile is
the illusion of having none.

338
00:23:49,045 --> 00:23:51,965
Chris asked me to get back in touch
to find out who you were running.

339
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:53,885
I said no.

340
00:23:55,205 --> 00:23:58,166
Then I realized
I wanted to anyway,

341
00:23:59,566 --> 00:24:01,446
because I missed you, too.

342
00:24:07,686 --> 00:24:10,207
Robert and I have been
squaring off over it.

343
00:24:10,327 --> 00:24:12,967
His first choice
is Roger Hawkins.

344
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:16,047
- Are you taking the piss?
- I fucking wish.

345
00:24:16,127 --> 00:24:18,608
But listen here, young lady.
If Robert continues

346
00:24:18,648 --> 00:24:23,568
to ignore my expert counsel,
and if you decide to contest,

347
00:24:23,648 --> 00:24:25,728
Roger will
make it a dirty fight.

348
00:24:25,848 --> 00:24:29,129
He'll play the populist card,
blow every dog-whistle.

349
00:24:29,209 --> 00:24:31,169
Are you trying to put me off?

350
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:34,025
- Is this guile?
- Fran, my love, don't make me call you an idiot again.

351
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:37,049
I'm giving you reasons
you should run,

352
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:40,930
and wipe the smug grin
off Hawkins' ruddy face.

353
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,890
Go for the seat.

354
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,130
Win it.

355
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,131
You'd have my vote.

356
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:56,611
This is what the liar government and
mainstream media don't want you to see.

357
00:24:56,651 --> 00:25:01,292
Radiation detectors. Because
our nation is secretly under attack.

358
00:25:01,372 --> 00:25:06,092
Nuclear attack. The corrupt traitor
Sutherland and his globalist stooges

359
00:25:06,132 --> 00:25:09,173
want to hide it from us.
Hide their weakness,

360
00:25:09,293 --> 00:25:12,413
their complicity in the
death of our great country.

361
00:25:12,453 --> 00:25:16,733
And until this government is
overthrown by whatever means necessary,

362
00:25:16,853 --> 00:25:19,814
they would have us
feed poison to our children

363
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:22,134
sooner than tell us the truth.

364
00:25:22,214 --> 00:25:27,654
These nuclear poison-berries came to Britain
directly from Ukraine, through Dover.

365
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:34,655
- Still working?
- Big case.

366
00:25:34,695 --> 00:25:36,455
You'll win.

367
00:25:36,575 --> 00:25:39,136
Is that by decree of Her
Majesty's Government?

368
00:25:39,216 --> 00:25:41,976
No, you'll win because
you're a brilliant lawyer,

369
00:25:42,096 --> 00:25:44,656
and spectacular woman.

370
00:25:44,736 --> 00:25:46,936
But if I did have to
bend this country's

371
00:25:47,056 --> 00:25:51,097
noble and ancient democratic institutions
for the sake of your affections...

372
00:25:51,137 --> 00:25:55,417
Only you could make brutal
dictatorship sound so romantic.

373
00:25:56,857 --> 00:25:59,658
Well, in the meantime,
I can offer to make you

374
00:25:59,698 --> 00:26:01,818
- a cup of tea.
- Ooh, yes.

375
00:26:06,418 --> 00:26:09,819
- Eleanor.
- Hi, uh, sorry it's late,

376
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:12,619
but I thought you'd want
an update on Cyclamen.

377
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:14,939
We've captured the malware.

378
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:17,659
- So the border can re-open?
- Imminently.

379
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:20,140
Oh, thank Christ for that.

380
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,980
- Well done.
- I do need to update you on something else.

381
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,340
We've been monitoring
various online channels,

382
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,581
and footage of that truck
from at least four devices

383
00:26:30,661 --> 00:26:33,741
has spread like bloody measles.
The open-sourcers

384
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:36,901
have identified
the radioactivity apparatus.

385
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:39,502
There's a new far-right
online presence, "Firestorm."

386
00:26:39,622 --> 00:26:42,062
They have been consistently
pointing the finger at government.

387
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,902
I wouldn't normally bother you with conspiracy
theorists, but they're not far off the truth,

388
00:26:45,942 --> 00:26:48,223
- and gaining traction.
- Christ!

389
00:26:48,343 --> 00:26:50,663
Look, the silence
from government

390
00:26:50,703 --> 00:26:54,383
is only adding fuel to it.

391
00:26:54,423 --> 00:26:57,943
We need to formulate
some kind of explanation

392
00:26:58,063 --> 00:27:00,384
take back control
of the narrative.

393
00:27:00,424 --> 00:27:02,744
Those vehicles that got through,

394
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:05,904
are they all accounted for?

395
00:27:05,984 --> 00:27:08,425
No, not quite. There are
nine as yet un-scanned.

396
00:27:08,505 --> 00:27:12,105
Well, when they are scanned and
when we're in the clear, and only then,

397
00:27:12,145 --> 00:27:14,305
- I shall make a statement.
- Prime Minister...

398
00:27:14,385 --> 00:27:18,666
The only way to counteract panic
and probably outright bloody mayhem

399
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:21,506
is by stating that we have
overcome the situation,

400
00:27:21,626 --> 00:27:24,226
that our defense
apparatus works.

401
00:27:24,346 --> 00:27:26,666
We convene COBRA in the
morning, assess the state of risk,

402
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:28,627
and strategize on that basis.

403
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:31,427
Well with respect,
Prime Minister, I don't think...

404
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:34,667
Goodnight, Eleanor.

405
00:27:34,747 --> 00:27:40,588
These nuclear poison-berries came to
Britain directly from Ukraine through Dover.

406
00:27:40,668 --> 00:27:42,748
The port, which is now closed,

407
00:27:42,868 --> 00:27:45,188
but the government
refused to tell us why.

408
00:27:45,308 --> 00:27:48,629
A government impotent
and venal, which does nothing

409
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:53,069
while Foreign enemies trample
our borders and ruin our land.

410
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:56,709
Our investigations
have revealed that these...

411
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,150
This is an unexpected pleasure.

412
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,646
Hari, have you got a minute? I
need your advice. Off the record.

413
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:08,991
- I mean, you're taking me away from alt-right nutters, but...
- What?

414
00:28:09,111 --> 00:28:11,071
- Uh, nothing. Talk to me.
- All right.

415
00:28:11,151 --> 00:28:15,111
If I, hypothetically speaking,
if I ran in a by-election,

416
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,871
- could I count on your support?
- Hypothetical support?

417
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:20,672
Your platform has traction.
The support would carry weight.

418
00:28:20,712 --> 00:28:22,912
Question, unrelated:

419
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:26,192
What's going on in Dover?
Something to do with radiation?

420
00:28:26,312 --> 00:28:29,833
People aren't buying the government
line. Do you know why it's closed?

421
00:28:29,913 --> 00:28:32,073
- No. Why?
- Doesn't matter. I just, uh...

422
00:28:32,153 --> 00:28:34,593
Well, listen,
what I was asking is just,

423
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:36,113
well, would you back me?

424
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:38,914
Holy shit.

425
00:28:39,914 --> 00:28:42,314
Hari?

426
00:28:42,394 --> 00:28:45,394
- Hello, Hari...
- Look, Francine, I'd back you in a bi-election

427
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:47,730
or a bloody general election.
I'll give all the signal-boost I can.

428
00:28:47,754 --> 00:28:49,075
But I'm sorry, I have to go.

429
00:29:24,238 --> 00:29:27,638
- God! Don't you ever sleep?
- No.

430
00:29:27,678 --> 00:29:30,719
And you'd better wake up too
because we might have a big problem.

431
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:34,679
- I just sent you the link.
- What problem?

432
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:37,599
- Look at it.
- All right! Wait, wait...

433
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,401
What is this?

434
00:29:49,441 --> 00:29:52,601
Did you know your wife
did legal for Mikhailo Kostenko?

435
00:29:53,521 --> 00:29:55,961
Of course I didn't bloody know.

436
00:29:56,081 --> 00:29:58,081
This is June 97.
We hadn't even met.

437
00:30:02,082 --> 00:30:04,682
- "Kickbacks"?
- So it bloody seems.

438
00:30:04,722 --> 00:30:09,123
The scoop of the day is that the
PM's wife was on the legal team

439
00:30:09,163 --> 00:30:13,163
which gave bungs on behalf
of a Ukrainian gangster.

440
00:30:13,243 --> 00:30:14,643
Shit.

441
00:30:18,364 --> 00:30:19,964
What is it? What's going on?

442
00:30:42,886 --> 00:30:47,166
I have never seen
any of these documents before.

443
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:49,087
I need the truth.

444
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:50,447
That is the truth.

445
00:30:52,447 --> 00:30:53,847
Then what the fuck is this?

446
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:02,608
This deal was over 20 years ago.

447
00:31:02,688 --> 00:31:05,248
I was barely even an associate.

448
00:31:05,368 --> 00:31:08,008
I never met Kostenko, I just...

449
00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:11,089
I didn't know
anything about kickbacks!

450
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,889
- Please believe me.
- I-I want to believe you Rachel,

451
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:17,969
but maybe you can
explain to me why...

452
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:21,850
Why you didn't
think it worth mentioning

453
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:26,010
that Kostenko's name crops up
in your career history.

454
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:30,211
I mean, what with his murky assassination
being all over the news lately, and me,

455
00:31:30,331 --> 00:31:32,971
your husband, being
the Prime fucking Minister.

456
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,771
Because it was a deal from a long
time ago that I played a tiny part in,

457
00:31:36,891 --> 00:31:38,908
and I didn't know there
was anything illegal about it

458
00:31:38,932 --> 00:31:41,372
until you waved this
fucking smear in my face.

459
00:31:41,452 --> 00:31:45,132
Because that's what this is,
Robert. A smear, and...

460
00:31:45,172 --> 00:31:49,893
None of this poison proves I did
anything wrong. Because I didn't!

461
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:04,094
But it's still poison.

462
00:32:10,935 --> 00:32:14,455
But Number Ten are yet to
comment on the alleged association

463
00:32:14,535 --> 00:32:18,696
between Mrs. Sutherland and the
recently deceased Ukrainian businessman.

464
00:32:18,776 --> 00:32:20,736
Mikhailo Kostenko.

465
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:53,539
Hello.

466
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:55,979
Mrs. Sutherland,
I'm calling again from the Sun.

467
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,516
Look, I've already told you, no comment. And
I've already blocked your number three times.

468
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,780
So please, just leave me alone!

469
00:33:41,504 --> 00:33:43,984
My God.
She's finally speechless.

470
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,590
The situation room have cleared
all but one of the trucks.

471
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:46,430
It's the one they flagged up
yesterday as having dodgy paperwork,

472
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,831
that's why it's proving
difficult to track down.

473
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:53,871
- And the haulier doesn't even exist.
- Okay, let's get it found.

474
00:34:53,951 --> 00:34:57,311
All forces nationwide
make this their priority.

475
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,472
Robert, we have to
talk about Rachel.

476
00:35:06,552 --> 00:35:09,593
- We need to discuss the way through this...
- No, we don't, Anna.

477
00:35:09,673 --> 00:35:11,393
People think they are
under nuclear attack,

478
00:35:11,473 --> 00:35:13,833
we have to
give them some reassurance.

479
00:35:13,913 --> 00:35:16,633
I-I know I pushed
against this before, but...

480
00:35:17,393 --> 00:35:18,994
I believe I was wrong.

481
00:35:20,274 --> 00:35:23,234
I'll make a statement
outside Downing Street.

482
00:35:23,314 --> 00:35:26,314
I'll explain about Cyclamen
and the fucking blueberries.

483
00:35:26,394 --> 00:35:29,235
I'll make it clear that Dover
will open again immediately,

484
00:35:29,315 --> 00:35:31,955
and the few vehicles that did get
through while the system was down

485
00:35:32,035 --> 00:35:35,275
are all accounted for.
There is no danger.

486
00:35:41,676 --> 00:35:43,396
- Have they been?
- Has what been?

487
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:45,356
The trucks. All accounted for.

488
00:35:45,436 --> 00:35:48,076
All except one. But I'm prepared
to take a chance they will be.

489
00:35:48,157 --> 00:35:51,477
Because as far as I can see,
this is the least worst option.

490
00:35:56,757 --> 00:35:58,638
I'm afraid I don't think it is.

491
00:35:58,758 --> 00:36:01,478
If there's only
one truck left to find,

492
00:36:01,558 --> 00:36:03,918
we wait until it's found.

493
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,959
I know the...

494
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:17,319
the situation with Rachel
makes you want to show strength,

495
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:22,160
but I think you, all of us,
need to hold our nerve.

496
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,080
We have a Cobra now about the
disruption across the country.

497
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,361
Let's get all the facts
before we react.

498
00:36:28,441 --> 00:36:32,921
When the vehicles are all accounted
for, then you make a statement.

499
00:36:33,521 --> 00:36:35,481
With strength.

500
00:36:38,482 --> 00:36:40,442
Shops are being
cleared of tinned goods.

501
00:36:40,482 --> 00:36:43,962
Sales of fresh
produce cratering.

502
00:36:44,042 --> 00:36:47,082
Well, it takes the pressure
off the supply line.

503
00:36:47,162 --> 00:36:49,883
And at least Intelligence
have finally managed

504
00:36:49,963 --> 00:36:52,603
to change the fuse
in the Cyclamen scanners.

505
00:36:52,683 --> 00:36:56,963
I'm sure the technicians at GCHQ
will be cheered by your support.

506
00:36:57,003 --> 00:36:58,964
Eleven hospitals
have admitted patients

507
00:36:59,044 --> 00:37:02,644
for drinking antiseptic
and disinfectant.

508
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:06,524
Supermarket in Bradford. The man
was shouting that all fruit and vegetables

509
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:10,485
are “nuclear poison” and
that he can make them safe.

510
00:37:10,525 --> 00:37:12,405
Store was evacuated.

511
00:37:12,485 --> 00:37:16,885
The liquid the man is spraying turns
out to be an iodine-based detergent.

512
00:37:16,965 --> 00:37:21,686
- We're also seeing aggressive mobs at ports.
- Ports?

513
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:24,766
- Only Dover was shut.
- Well, that's just it.

514
00:37:24,846 --> 00:37:27,526
They're not at Dover,
it's the other ports.

515
00:37:27,606 --> 00:37:30,847
The open ports,
we're seeing the mobs.

516
00:37:30,927 --> 00:37:34,687
They're convinced that terrorists are
bringing in nuclear God-knows-what.

517
00:37:34,807 --> 00:37:37,047
Apologies for the interruption,
but you need to see this.

518
00:37:37,087 --> 00:37:39,768
The final vehicle, the one we
couldn't find, it was deliberate.

519
00:37:39,848 --> 00:37:42,568
Fake plates, fake papers.
They've found it.

520
00:37:46,928 --> 00:37:48,569
Where is it, Fraser?

521
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:51,089
Beneath Waterloo.

522
00:37:52,649 --> 00:37:54,289
It, um...

523
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:55,969
It doesn't look good.

524
00:38:14,931 --> 00:38:16,611
We've no idea
how it got there.

525
00:38:16,691 --> 00:38:19,812
It's in a sealed-off
maintenance area

526
00:38:19,892 --> 00:38:22,412
with no public access.

527
00:38:22,492 --> 00:38:25,852
A Military CBRN team
are going in to investigate.

528
00:38:34,933 --> 00:38:37,933
We have a visual
on suspect vehicle.

529
00:38:50,255 --> 00:38:52,695
How did this truck just appear?

530
00:38:56,615 --> 00:38:57,975
Didn't CCTV pick it up?

531
00:38:58,015 --> 00:39:01,256
Whoever left the vehicle,
took it out.

532
00:39:01,336 --> 00:39:04,256
Specialist,
approach with caution.

533
00:39:19,938 --> 00:39:22,778
Alpha-wave radiation detected.

534
00:39:25,938 --> 00:39:30,059
This is high. It...
It's extremely high.

535
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:33,779
Radioactivity levels
are off the scale.

536
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:37,859
We need to
seal off Central London.

537
00:39:37,939 --> 00:39:40,100
There's no way
we can do this quietly.

538
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,780
Do it then.

539
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,581
Initiating breach
for video probe access.

540
00:40:01,102 --> 00:40:02,302
Cyclamen.

541
00:40:05,622 --> 00:40:07,942
This is what
it was all for, isn't it?

542
00:40:09,383 --> 00:40:11,823
To get that truck
into the country.

543
00:40:13,943 --> 00:40:16,503
That is now
our working hypothesis.

544
00:40:26,504 --> 00:40:29,345
Inspection camera
uplink ready.

545
00:40:30,265 --> 00:40:31,945
Please activate the feed.

546
00:40:39,826 --> 00:40:43,346
Zero visibility.
Switch to infra-red.

547
00:40:46,866 --> 00:40:48,507
We're getting a visual.

548
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:50,827
What is it?

549
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,427
Adjust infra-red strength.

550
00:40:53,507 --> 00:40:54,867
What's he seeing?

551
00:41:01,268 --> 00:41:02,348
Standby.

552
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:12,949
The truck contains
what appears to be...

553
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:17,269
a human body.

554
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:24,110
The body
is the irradiating mass.

555
00:41:34,991 --> 00:41:38,031
Can't we just admit
that this is a clear message

556
00:41:38,111 --> 00:41:42,712
that our security apparatus
is completely inadequate?

557
00:41:45,112 --> 00:41:46,272
Get it out of there.

558
00:41:47,352 --> 00:41:48,673
Make it safe.

559
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:53,513
I want to know who it is...

560
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:56,353
and how it got there.

561
00:41:58,434 --> 00:42:00,034
And I want to know if...

562
00:42:02,314 --> 00:42:04,714
if this country needs
to be ready for war.
