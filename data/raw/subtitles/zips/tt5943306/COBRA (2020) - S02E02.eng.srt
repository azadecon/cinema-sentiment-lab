1
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,575
Audrey!

2
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:37,976
- Audrey! Hold on!
- Help. I can't see.

3
00:00:44,056 --> 00:00:45,417
Audrey!

4
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:53,097
- Help me. Help!
- Audrey! Audrey, hold on, I'm coming!

5
00:00:56,378 --> 00:00:57,938
- Audrey!
- Help!

6
00:00:58,018 --> 00:01:01,458
Come on. Hold on.

7
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:07,739
It's okay.

8
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,820
Come on. Come on.

9
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:42,982
It's gonna be fine.

10
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:18,946
Do we have
an update from Fraser?

11
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:21,066
Yes.

12
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:24,626
He's alright and is overseeing
the Strategic Command Center.

13
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,907
One of his team is missing,
presumed dead.

14
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:30,467
As is the local MP,
Clive Turner,

15
00:02:30,507 --> 00:02:32,907
who was assisting
with the evacuation.

16
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:35,948
Yes, I heard about Clive.

17
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:40,188
Must call his wife.

18
00:02:41,468 --> 00:02:46,349
- So, current casualties stand at?
- -Um...

19
00:02:46,429 --> 00:02:49,349
Over 300.
And it will go up.

20
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,189
Many still missing in flood areas
or in buildings that have collapsed.

21
00:02:53,309 --> 00:02:55,630
Things are absolutely chaotic.

22
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,590
The hack on our communication
systems have made things impossible.

23
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:04,230
Operations to deal with inland flooding
are messed up by the loss of ECON,

24
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,471
and triage is also made far more difficult,
especially for the burns victims.

25
00:03:09,511 --> 00:03:11,631
They've resorted to
mobiles in most cases,

26
00:03:11,751 --> 00:03:14,071
but that's putting
a huge strain on the system.

27
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:16,752
Additional lives are certainly
being lost because of it.

28
00:03:18,752 --> 00:03:23,072
Okay, so the correlation
between the cyber-attack...

29
00:03:23,152 --> 00:03:26,753
- Is it correlation?
- The time of the attack

30
00:03:26,793 --> 00:03:29,953
coinciding with our arrest
of the Kostenko suspects

31
00:03:30,073 --> 00:03:32,633
suggests a concerted
hostile nation

32
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:35,354
rather than some
script-kiddies in a basement.

33
00:03:35,434 --> 00:03:38,474
So, you think the choice of the
emergency services was deliberate?

34
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:43,634
They found a zero-day weakness in
ECON which is a relatively new system.

35
00:03:43,754 --> 00:03:45,875
Establishing authorship
is complicated

36
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:48,635
because there are a lot of
new obfuscators in the coding.

37
00:03:48,755 --> 00:03:50,491
I know you lot like
everything bilingual, but...

38
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:52,635
She means they exploited
an unknown weakness

39
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:56,076
in the new emergency
network communication system,

40
00:03:56,196 --> 00:04:00,076
and there's also a lot of deliberate rubbish
written into the code to act as chaff,

41
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:03,476
- so we can't tell who did it.
- Thank you, Home Secretary.

42
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:06,197
That is an admirable summary.

43
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:10,597
We are working flat out for a
patch for the Ruin Britannia hack.

44
00:04:10,637 --> 00:04:12,437
Well, let's hope
that's the end of it.

45
00:04:12,557 --> 00:04:15,438
If the cyber-attack is linked to our
detention of the Kostenko suspects,

46
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:16,878
and it's costing lives...

47
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,758
So we could just release them
and get it over with?

48
00:04:21,758 --> 00:04:22,998
No.

49
00:04:23,118 --> 00:04:24,678
Okay.

50
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:27,239
Summon the Russian
Ambassador immediately.

51
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:31,239
- We don't know for certain...
- That journalist, Hari Misra.

52
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,560
He claimed on the Breakfast Show this
morning that two arrests had been made.

53
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,440
Get him to divulge his source,

54
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,640
or he will be given a painful lesson
in the true meaning of cancel culture

55
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,760
in the basement under
Thames House.

56
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,241
Get our communications fixed and bring
me proof that the Russians are behind this,

57
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:51,881
so we can decide on a proportionate
response. In short, Eleanor,

58
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,441
do your job.

59
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:05,683
Anna.

60
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:10,883
- He's not in a particularly good mood.
- Sorry?

61
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:14,563
Oh, don't worry, I'll be kicking
someone down the ladder a lot harder.

62
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:19,684
There's also the Singer Report into
the J23 shootings making him jumpy.

63
00:05:19,764 --> 00:05:23,324
- We're supposed to get an advance view of it tomorrow.
- I hear it won't destroy him.

64
00:05:23,444 --> 00:05:27,925
- I hear that too, but until we see it...
- Anna...

65
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:30,445
that's not what I want to
talk to you about.

66
00:05:35,686 --> 00:05:38,566
It's about Edin Tosumbegovic.

67
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:54,887
Edin was waiting
for his killers.

68
00:05:54,927 --> 00:05:59,008
He knew it might not be quick,
what they had in mind...

69
00:06:00,368 --> 00:06:03,128
so he put a bullet
through his own head.

70
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,689
I will go to my house...

71
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,449
and I will sit under the fig
trees among the butterflies,

72
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:13,569
and I will wait
for you to come.

73
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,810
I love you.

74
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,010
I have always loved you.

75
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:29,091
- Do you think I was a bit harsh in there?
- I've spoken to her.

76
00:06:33,011 --> 00:06:34,091
You okay?

77
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:35,892
I'm fine.

78
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:43,572
Singer Report will be with us
tomorrow. It's confirmed now.

79
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:57,254
- Are you sure you're oka...
- Jesus Christ! Yes, I'm fine!

80
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,014
Just back the fuck off!

81
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,499
Home Secretary.

82
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:56,700
- How are you?
- All right.

83
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,460
I thought I was going to
drown in that car.

84
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,940
- Look, Fraser, you don't have to be here.
- I'm staying here.

85
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:10,381
One of my team
was out on the naval boat.

86
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:12,461
I heard that, I'm truly sorry.

87
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:15,222
She didn't want to
go out, you know?

88
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:18,342
- There was no point in her going.
- There will have been a point,

89
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:20,022
or you wouldn't have sent her.

90
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:24,462
I really must try
and contact Audrey's family.

91
00:08:25,663 --> 00:08:28,103
Okay, are they fixing the comms?

92
00:08:28,223 --> 00:08:30,703
We're fighting this battle with
our hands tied behind our back.

93
00:08:30,823 --> 00:08:33,863
If they don't fix this hack, we're
going to lose hundreds of lives.

94
00:08:33,943 --> 00:08:36,944
They're doing what they can,
but there's no fix in sight.

95
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:41,184
Are we sinking?

96
00:08:42,744 --> 00:08:44,704
The explosion damaged the raft.

97
00:08:44,744 --> 00:08:47,105
We're taking on water and
losing air, we haven't got long.

98
00:08:48,985 --> 00:08:50,945
How are we still alive?

99
00:08:51,545 --> 00:08:52,985
Sheer good luck.

100
00:08:53,105 --> 00:08:55,866
The blast pushed us away
and towards the wind farm.

101
00:08:55,946 --> 00:08:59,466
- What are we going to do?
- The wind is pushing us towards the turbines,

102
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:02,866
so you need to get some rest before
we head back out into the sea again.

103
00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:06,107
- What?
- About the third turbine along is a maintenance vessel.

104
00:09:06,227 --> 00:09:09,347
The raft has taken on too
much water, we'll need to swim.

105
00:09:09,947 --> 00:09:11,427
I can't.

106
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:17,628
If you don't, you'll die here.

107
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:21,748
No helicopters can fly in these conditions,
and they won't be able to see us anyway.

108
00:09:26,469 --> 00:09:29,429
I'll help you get there.

109
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:32,069
I'm not going back
in the fucking sea, okay?

110
00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:33,589
I would rather die here.

111
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,350
Fair enough.

112
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,710
I'll head out
in about 20 minutes then.

113
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,470
I'll come back for your body
if I can find any help.

114
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:49,711
Were you born to a woman or did
they just carve you out of granite?

115
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:52,471
The swim will be fine
as long as you stay close.

116
00:09:55,472 --> 00:09:56,872
Don't rub your eyes.

117
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:03,592
And don't make any sarky
comments either, I'm trying to help you.

118
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:07,313
Focus on staying alive.

119
00:10:07,353 --> 00:10:09,953
Oh, I never
sweat the small stuff.

120
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:13,833
Sorry.

121
00:10:24,954 --> 00:10:28,355
So, it appears in the
midst of a terrible disaster,

122
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:30,595
a serious cyber-attack
has been launched

123
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:33,235
on the United Kingdom's
emergency services.

124
00:10:33,355 --> 00:10:36,332
I turn to you, Archie Glover-Morgan, I would
imagine that as a former Home Secretary,

125
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:40,716
- who is behind this?
- That's for the security services to ascertain.

126
00:10:40,836 --> 00:10:42,876
If they're up to it.

127
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:45,733
There's a report out today, a
journalist claiming this is linked to the.

128
00:10:45,757 --> 00:10:49,557
Kostenko assassination. It also says
that two arrests have already been made.

129
00:10:49,597 --> 00:10:53,717
I can't speculate on that, but the
idea that whoever is behind this

130
00:10:53,757 --> 00:10:57,238
could paralyze our most
critical communications

131
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:59,718
does suggest that somebody
has got things very wrong here.

132
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:04,238
I imagine a senior figure will have
to pay a price for this appalling lapse.

133
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:06,319
We're going to
hear from your successor.

134
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:09,439
Let's go to Kent and join
Mr Obasi. Good morning.

135
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:12,359
- Things look very bad there.
- Good morning, Karen. Yes,

136
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:15,480
and I would like to pay tribute to
the incredible effort and heroism

137
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,200
- of the emergency services.
- Of course.

138
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,600
You are, it appears,
attempting a rescue mission...

139
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,560
I think you should see this.

140
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,816
...in what seems like an almost
complete communications blackout.

141
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,121
- Is that anyone's fault?
- Believe me, we will be carrying out an urgent review.

142
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:32,881
This is the Ruin Britannia code that is
crippling the communications network.

143
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:36,002
The call-back code is definitely
pointing towards a Russian source,

144
00:11:36,122 --> 00:11:39,202
but that could just be
a framing device.

145
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:42,242
- What's it going to do next?
- We're not sure.

146
00:11:42,362 --> 00:11:45,963
It doesn't appear to have a kill
switch built in. This sequence here

147
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,323
- is what's worrying us.
- Why?

148
00:11:48,363 --> 00:11:52,243
We think it could be lining up to attack
another part of the communications system.

149
00:11:52,323 --> 00:11:54,723
The mobile networks
are all they have left in Kent.

150
00:11:54,763 --> 00:11:56,724
We can't lose them too.

151
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:18,886
I'm sorry.

152
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:25,727
You don't have to apologize.

153
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:29,767
Do you know now?

154
00:12:31,447 --> 00:12:32,847
Yes.

155
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:49,009
Have you made your mind up
about the prisoners?

156
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:51,609
I've been carrying out
consultations.

157
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:55,330
- With whom?
- The Archangel and the Prole.

158
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,730
Wait. Moral philosophy?

159
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,730
Sometimes, you can go
with an intuitive hunch

160
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,491
on maximizing utility.

161
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:07,891
Let a pair of criminals
go to save lives...

162
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:11,451
Sometimes, you have to apply
a higher form of reasoning.

163
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:13,851
Well,

164
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:17,492
the Russians have issued strong
denials to the press-rumors

165
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:20,492
that their agents had anything
to do with the cyber-attack.

166
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:22,972
I can't let them go, Anna.

167
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:25,229
And for what it's worth, I think
that's the right decision.

168
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:27,093
It would show fatal weakness.

169
00:13:29,613 --> 00:13:31,453
You always were an Archangel.

170
00:13:33,093 --> 00:13:36,134
Even back in college when we
were just a pair of Tory geeks.

171
00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:37,614
Shut up, geek.

172
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,494
I was a high-fashion queen.

173
00:13:39,574 --> 00:13:42,334
- I had all the invites.
- Yeah.

174
00:13:45,014 --> 00:13:47,375
- Your eleven o'clock.
- Yeah.

175
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:53,975
You ready?

176
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,256
No.

177
00:13:58,376 --> 00:14:00,976
We need to go now. Come on.

178
00:14:01,016 --> 00:14:02,216
I'll help you.

179
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,977
We're as close
as we're gonna get.

180
00:14:15,738 --> 00:14:17,098
Come on.

181
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:27,139
Right this way.

182
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,219
Come on.

183
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,620
I want you back
in the shadow-cabinet.

184
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,860
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

185
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,861
Just one small
problem with that.

186
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,141
Well, actually, there are quite
a lot of large problems with that.

187
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:52,957
But not being an MP is probably
the biggest one, right?

188
00:14:52,981 --> 00:14:55,262
Oh, there'll be
a bi-election soon enough.

189
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:58,342
Particularly if what I'm hearing
from Kent about...

190
00:14:58,382 --> 00:15:00,462
- Too soon, maybe?
- Maybe.

191
00:15:00,502 --> 00:15:03,382
Well, let's just talk in general terms
until the funeral has taken place.

192
00:15:03,462 --> 00:15:07,743
- What if the local party refu...
- The NEC can impose a candidate, or...

193
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:10,783
- have a limited short-list.
- They haven't all gone away, you know.

194
00:15:10,863 --> 00:15:12,383
I don't want 'em all
to go away.

195
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:14,383
I'm not the most
popular person in this party.

196
00:15:14,503 --> 00:15:17,584
- You do remember the way I was treated?
- Yeah, they can piss right off.

197
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:19,864
Some of what went on
was an absolute disgrace.

198
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:22,360
Although, in fairness, some on the
right of the party didn't help much either.

199
00:15:22,384 --> 00:15:25,505
- I'm not on the right. That's the whole bloody...
- Yeah, I get it.

200
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,985
The thing is...

201
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:31,345
I don't really care much about
labels anymore. What I care about

202
00:15:31,385 --> 00:15:32,905
is having smart,
competent people

203
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:35,666
who can deal with Joseph Obasi
across the dispatch box.

204
00:15:35,746 --> 00:15:37,866
- Wait...
- No, it's not because of that.

205
00:15:37,906 --> 00:15:40,122
It's because Obasi is bloody sharp, and
will make mincemeat of anybody who isn't.

206
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:42,866
You're smart and you're
competent. I like that.

207
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,627
Okay.

208
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:48,867
Get them to sort my
membership card out first though

209
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:52,747
because knowing this lot, it won't
arrive before the next General Election.

210
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:55,268
I'll personally put it
in the post, you wait.

211
00:15:55,348 --> 00:15:57,908
- Sorry.
- Okay.

212
00:15:57,988 --> 00:15:59,108
Yeah.

213
00:16:33,391 --> 00:16:35,912
You okay?

214
00:16:37,272 --> 00:16:39,512
Yeah.

215
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:28,877
It's no use, it's dead.

216
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:32,797
I tried to call out, but all we got was
some weird error message about Britannia.

217
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:35,158
Is there anyone else on board?

218
00:17:35,198 --> 00:17:38,038
Couple of lads were outside,
and got blown away.

219
00:17:39,398 --> 00:17:40,798
Have you done
any damage assessment?

220
00:17:40,838 --> 00:17:43,558
Port side took the full force
of the explosion.

221
00:17:43,638 --> 00:17:47,879
And we're taking on water. With this
swell, unless they get someone here soon,

222
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:49,919
we are going down.

223
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,720
The emergency services search and rescue
operations in Kent have been heavily...

224
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,720
The Ruin Britannia virus is now
attacking the mobile networks.

225
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,360
The flooding is not relenting,

226
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,481
and people are still being
found in collapsed buildings.

227
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:08,721
We won't be able to cope with no
emergency communications or mobiles.

228
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:12,441
At the moment,
our prime suspect is Sednit.

229
00:18:12,561 --> 00:18:13,921
The Russian
cyber-attack division?

230
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,642
Yes, although, we need
to be very careful.

231
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,562
There is a chance that
it's being made to look

232
00:18:18,642 --> 00:18:21,202
like a Russian attack
to throw us off the scent.

233
00:18:21,322 --> 00:18:24,602
We should have just let them
slip away in the first place.

234
00:18:24,642 --> 00:18:27,059
Well, that's not helping our
current predicament, though, is it?

235
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:31,323
Have to admit, Robert, I am unsure what
the Archangel would say about this one.

236
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:34,563
- Russian Ambassador here?
- Yeah, he's waiting in the terracotta room.

237
00:18:34,643 --> 00:18:36,684
Is it worth
hundreds of other lives?

238
00:18:36,804 --> 00:18:39,844
Yes, I'm aware
of the calculus, thank you.

239
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,885
This is an absolute catastrophe.
Nobody can talk to anybody now.

240
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,645
We have people waiting for
transfers to burns units,

241
00:18:49,685 --> 00:18:52,445
the entire triage system
is going to fall apart.

242
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,085
We're going to need
some little ships.

243
00:18:56,326 --> 00:18:58,206
Couriers.

244
00:18:58,326 --> 00:19:02,166
They're going to have to be able
to carry communications by hand

245
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:05,727
between the emergency services
and the hospitals.

246
00:19:05,847 --> 00:19:08,647
It's the only option now that
the phone masts have gone.

247
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:11,847
Miserable bastards.

248
00:19:20,648 --> 00:19:22,848
Sutherland should
let the Russians go.

249
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:25,449
It's tough.

250
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:27,585
I would never have arrested them
in the first place.

251
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:30,049
- Luckily, those aren't my choices.
- -Sir.

252
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:36,570
He's authorized. Show him in.

253
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,090
What's up?

254
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,170
Audrey Hemmings'
next-of-kin. Her brother.

255
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,450
I have to speak to him.

256
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,730
Go on.

257
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:53,331
- Ambassador Voronin.
- Prime Minister.

258
00:19:53,411 --> 00:19:57,572
So, you are, of course, aware that
we have two of your citizens detained.

259
00:19:57,652 --> 00:20:00,052
Only one of them is actually
a Russian citizen.

260
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:03,132
And are you aware of
speculation in the British press

261
00:20:03,172 --> 00:20:06,413
linking them to the assassination
of Mikhailo Kostenko?

262
00:20:06,453 --> 00:20:08,973
I am aware of yet another
attempt to blame my country

263
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:11,173
for every mishap
you bring on yourselves.

264
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:12,933
Shall we just cut to the chase?

265
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:15,310
If you are referring to your
current communications issues...

266
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:19,254
In the middle of a major rescue
operation which is costing extra lives.

267
00:20:19,374 --> 00:20:22,174
You will be accusing us
of blowing up the ship next.

268
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,174
Of staging an earthquake.

269
00:20:24,214 --> 00:20:26,191
I wonder what could've made
us so ridiculously paranoid.

270
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:30,175
Your game of "blame the Russians
for all your problems" will not work.

271
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:33,895
I would especially counsel against
it if you do not want to look very foolish.

272
00:20:33,975 --> 00:20:37,816
So, all of this is totally
unrelated to the fact that.

273
00:20:37,896 --> 00:20:42,136
Klara Lechkova
is implicated in the crime,

274
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:46,497
and is related to a senior
member of your security services?

275
00:20:46,617 --> 00:20:48,657
I can assure you

276
00:20:48,697 --> 00:20:52,417
that the person you have
detained is not Klara Lechkova.

277
00:20:52,457 --> 00:20:55,218
She is currently at
her dacha outside Moscow

278
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:57,858
to the best of my knowledge.

279
00:20:57,898 --> 00:20:59,898
Our intelligence
services tell me

280
00:20:59,978 --> 00:21:03,178
that the woman you have
detained is actually Larissa Petrova.

281
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:06,659
A low-level criminal and
fraudster who is also involved

282
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:11,179
in the commission of teams of foreign
criminals to break into luxury houses.

283
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:13,459
Rodrigo Araya is simply a madman

284
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:16,940
who believes he is the
reincarnation of Che Guevara.

285
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,820
By all means, prosecute them
for shoplifting and lock them up.

286
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,380
I can assure you that my
government will be delighted.

287
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,661
- All our information... -They've tricked us.
- So that we look stupid.

288
00:21:27,741 --> 00:21:29,861
How can you
say that, Anna?

289
00:21:29,901 --> 00:21:33,221
- I don't feel stupid at all.
- But the fact that it might not be Lechkova,

290
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:36,262
- doesn't mean they weren't involved in the assassination.
- Exactly.

291
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:40,102
- If it was an attempt...
- Can I just be really clear about something.

292
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:43,662
A significant part of the Kent
coastline is no longer there.

293
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:47,663
We are going to have to resort to smoke-signals
soon to organize hospital transfers.

294
00:21:47,703 --> 00:21:49,559
- I think we should...
- So wasting precious time

295
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,623
having the Russians
make us look like fucking idiots

296
00:21:51,663 --> 00:21:54,719
- was really not part of my to-do list this morning.
- It wasn't top of any of our...

297
00:21:54,743 --> 00:21:57,904
Go and find out who these
clowns are that we've detained,

298
00:21:57,944 --> 00:21:59,904
and find out where
the real culprits are.

299
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:13,905
So...

300
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:20,746
putting aside whoever
killed Mikhailo Kostenko...

301
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:22,666
Exactly.

302
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:26,867
What if it's not connected
to this cyber-attack?

303
00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:31,427
What if it's something
else completely?

304
00:22:36,508 --> 00:22:38,628
There's loads of
weird shit going on.

305
00:22:38,668 --> 00:22:41,388
The killing, then the boat,

306
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:45,389
- then this cyber-attack...
- Who says they're connected?

307
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:48,429
What do you think caused the earth
tremors that made the ship go up?

308
00:22:48,469 --> 00:22:51,669
I don't know, what normally causes
them? Stuff moving underground.

309
00:22:51,709 --> 00:22:55,510
Big North Sea drilling contract given
to the Chinese Jiayoõu Corporation.

310
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,166
The Yanks were pissed off
about that as well.

311
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,486
Watch and see if they try and
pin the blame on them for it.

312
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,150
Okay, I gotta tell you, I'm not
one for conspiracy theories.

313
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,670
I don't think mobile phone masts
can cause pandemics

314
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,591
or George Soros can
conjure up an earthquake.

315
00:23:06,671 --> 00:23:08,751
Okay, but something's going on,

316
00:23:08,871 --> 00:23:11,191
- because I've got MI5 all over me.
- Good.

317
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:14,511
Someone's leaking you explosive
stuff that affects national security.

318
00:23:14,631 --> 00:23:16,072
That's their job.

319
00:23:16,872 --> 00:23:18,432
You'd better be very careful.

320
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,754
What was she doing on the boat?

321
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:40,674
- Observing the naval operation.
- Why aren't you out there looking for her?

322
00:23:40,714 --> 00:23:43,754
You've seen what it's like
out there. Visibility is terrible,

323
00:23:43,874 --> 00:23:45,595
we almost lost a chopper today.

324
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:49,115
I told our mum she's missing,
but they'll probably find her.

325
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:50,675
Now I get here, and...

326
00:23:52,235 --> 00:23:55,916
my mum won't be able to cope
with this. Audrey's the baby.

327
00:23:55,996 --> 00:23:59,236
The one with the brains, me
and Fred always looked out for her.

328
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:02,596
I just feel there's something I should
be doing, some way of finding her.

329
00:24:02,676 --> 00:24:04,436
I'm sorry.

330
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:07,917
If conditions improve, we'll send
rescue helicopters in the morning.

331
00:24:09,277 --> 00:24:10,757
I'll tell my brother.

332
00:24:10,877 --> 00:24:13,837
- There's no phone coverage.
- How come?

333
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:17,918
The virus has spread from the
emergency services to the mobile networks.

334
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,718
Bloody hell.

335
00:24:19,838 --> 00:24:21,598
That must make it impossible.

336
00:24:21,678 --> 00:24:24,198
Yeah, it's pretty hard.

337
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:27,439
I've got to try and assemble
a team of couriers who can

338
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:30,639
scuttle between all the
emergency sites with hard data.

339
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:32,639
I might be able to help
with that as it goes.

340
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,001
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

341
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:49,881
So, why haven't
they come for us?

342
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,921
Helicopters can't fly out with
all the debris in the air.

343
00:24:52,961 --> 00:24:54,601
Things must be bad onshore.

344
00:24:55,482 --> 00:24:56,602
Really bad.

345
00:25:09,443 --> 00:25:12,483
- She's taking on a lot of water now.
- We can't stay here.

346
00:25:14,403 --> 00:25:16,444
Where do you suggest we go?

347
00:25:32,085 --> 00:25:34,085
We have to climb up
to the platform!

348
00:25:40,086 --> 00:25:41,526
You go first.

349
00:25:41,646 --> 00:25:45,527
- Just focus on getting to the top.
- Oh, great, yeah!

350
00:25:46,487 --> 00:25:48,007
I'll be right behind you!

351
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:49,887
Okay?

352
00:25:50,407 --> 00:25:53,007
Go!

353
00:26:04,888 --> 00:26:07,369
Don't look down!

354
00:26:07,449 --> 00:26:10,969
Do not look down.
Come on! Come on.

355
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:15,530
Come on.

356
00:26:30,931 --> 00:26:33,451
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, good.

357
00:26:57,454 --> 00:26:58,734
Put it on the screen.

358
00:27:00,374 --> 00:27:02,894
The Ambassador was correct.

359
00:27:04,214 --> 00:27:05,895
This is not Klara Lechkova.

360
00:27:05,935 --> 00:27:10,455
This is an impersonator who
used her documentation,

361
00:27:10,535 --> 00:27:12,135
and Araya is...

362
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:14,935
just a piece of work.

363
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:17,976
Okay.

364
00:27:18,696 --> 00:27:21,216
So, Kostenko gets hit.

365
00:27:21,256 --> 00:27:23,096
The Russians
frame themselves for it...

366
00:27:23,176 --> 00:27:25,377
Which implies they knew
about it, at the very least.

367
00:27:25,457 --> 00:27:28,433
But then, in punishment for arresting the
people they actually wanted us to arrest...

368
00:27:28,457 --> 00:27:31,697
- So we would look stupid...
- They launch a cyber-attack.

369
00:27:35,698 --> 00:27:38,778
Look into retaliatory cyber
operations for this disgrace.

370
00:27:38,898 --> 00:27:41,218
Division 45 are already on it.

371
00:27:41,258 --> 00:27:42,778
I will bring you
a target list later.

372
00:27:42,898 --> 00:27:45,299
- Are we sure...
- I'm not letting this go.

373
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:48,779
It's one thing to whack oligarchs
on our shores, it's quite another

374
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:51,139
to rub our noses in it
during a disaster.

375
00:27:51,219 --> 00:27:52,699
Okay, on that.

376
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:56,020
GCHQ are also picking up
some other noise.

377
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,700
What noise?

378
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,140
That the drilling operation
in the North Sea

379
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,700
might have contributed
to the explosion.

380
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:11,421
- Is there any hard evidence for that?
- No, not yet.

381
00:28:11,461 --> 00:28:15,021
But it is a rumor that will grow
legs and be running pretty soon.

382
00:28:15,141 --> 00:28:18,862
We've been under a lot of pressure not
to move forward with the Jiayóu Contract.

383
00:28:18,942 --> 00:28:21,542
Well, you might want to
announce a pause on that.

384
00:28:21,662 --> 00:28:23,782
Just to evaluate things.

385
00:28:26,303 --> 00:28:29,143
This will really piss
a lot of people off.

386
00:28:33,743 --> 00:28:35,704
- Audrey Hepburn?
- Yeah.

387
00:28:35,784 --> 00:28:39,784
And my brothers are Fred
for Astaire and Cary for Grant.

388
00:28:39,904 --> 00:28:42,664
- His real name was Archibald Leach.
- I know, yeah.

389
00:28:42,704 --> 00:28:46,385
Oh, yeah. I like those old
black and white films as well.

390
00:28:46,465 --> 00:28:49,505
- Where you from, love?
- Originally from Bermondsey,

391
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:51,425
but then we moved out
to Rochester.

392
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:53,865
Bet your old man's
proper 'Wall, right?

393
00:28:55,746 --> 00:28:59,226
He died. But yeah, he was.

394
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:03,226
More Millwall in Rochester
than Bermondsey now.

395
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:06,147
Game's gone though, hasn't it?
Money men killed it.

396
00:29:06,227 --> 00:29:09,667
No, get yourself down
to a lower league game,

397
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:12,147
they're still a good laugh.

398
00:29:12,227 --> 00:29:16,748
Sometimes, me and my brother go to Fisher
FC. It's lovely at night if you look out...

399
00:29:16,868 --> 00:29:19,228
Will you stop talking?

400
00:29:19,268 --> 00:29:20,924
It wouldn't hurt to be
polite now and again.

401
00:29:20,948 --> 00:29:23,708
Look, I'm trying to think and
you are distracting me.

402
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:36,230
I'm going to swim to shore.

403
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,870
You'll never make it. Not in
the dark and in these conditions.

404
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:42,910
We have no food or water,
but more importantly, shelter.

405
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:47,431
Exposure will set in with the wind chill
and the temperature could drop even further.

406
00:29:47,471 --> 00:29:49,031
You'll probably die first...

407
00:29:50,271 --> 00:29:51,991
because you're older
and out of shape.

408
00:29:53,431 --> 00:29:54,751
Thimble of laughs, this one.

409
00:29:54,871 --> 00:29:57,632
Yeah, he's a one-man
comedy channel.

410
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,752
- I'm gonna go for it.
- You're mad.

411
00:30:04,912 --> 00:30:06,713
You can't leave us.

412
00:30:20,474 --> 00:30:21,994
He's gonna die out there.

413
00:31:04,998 --> 00:31:08,239
Mr. Glover-Morgan,
Prime Minister.

414
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,561
Return the whip
to my little band of brothers,

415
00:31:25,681 --> 00:31:28,401
and you increase
your majority by eight.

416
00:31:28,481 --> 00:31:31,241
You will see me talking to
you as a sign of weakness.

417
00:31:31,281 --> 00:31:33,241
- Not at all.
- And it is.

418
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:37,242
But I want you to understand
something very important.

419
00:31:37,282 --> 00:31:41,002
My parliamentary situation
is weak, but I am not.

420
00:31:41,122 --> 00:31:44,482
That's not a mistake I've ever
made about you, Robert.

421
00:31:46,043 --> 00:31:49,123
If you were weak, you wouldn't
be talking to me now.

422
00:31:51,683 --> 00:31:55,724
- The Singer Report will exonerate you.
- We'll see.

423
00:31:55,804 --> 00:31:58,524
In a way that's
convenient for both of us.

424
00:31:58,644 --> 00:32:02,804
- You never resigned on principle.
- I certainly did.

425
00:32:02,924 --> 00:32:06,165
It just depends which principle
you are talking about.

426
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:09,565
There's a mark, Archie.

427
00:32:09,685 --> 00:32:11,445
Don't overstep it,

428
00:32:11,485 --> 00:32:14,485
or things will get
very nasty very quickly.

429
00:32:14,525 --> 00:32:17,646
Well, as we are being candid,
please take this in a similar spirit.

430
00:32:17,726 --> 00:32:22,006
I care about my country, and when it's
in peril, I wish to be in the frontline

431
00:32:22,126 --> 00:32:24,326
- defending it.
- I believe that, too.

432
00:32:24,446 --> 00:32:27,223
I don't think you are the best man
to lead either the party or the country,

433
00:32:27,247 --> 00:32:30,967
but I will work with you
to keep both in one piece.

434
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:33,647
- I'd like to give you one piece of advice.
- Go on.

435
00:32:33,727 --> 00:32:38,128
Sack Eleanor James. She should never
have allowed us to get into this mess.

436
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,728
She's not the person
to get us out of it.

437
00:32:41,968 --> 00:32:43,808
Always wanting me
to sack someone.

438
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:46,969
Oh, Anna.

439
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:51,249
No, imagining you telling her
you're returning the whip to us

440
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:54,409
will be karma enough.

441
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:57,730
I should, perhaps, tell you
I have asked Peter Mott

442
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,250
to be my adviser.

443
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:04,050
You absolute child, Archie.

444
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:07,931
I want to be back in the
COBRA room during this crisis.

445
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:10,811
As?

446
00:33:10,931 --> 00:33:14,731
You could always make me
Foreign Secretary.

447
00:33:17,812 --> 00:33:19,772
You're not joking, are you?

448
00:33:19,892 --> 00:33:23,412
I have a certain manner, Robert, you
know that. It has served me well over time,

449
00:33:23,492 --> 00:33:25,653
kept me amused,
but at the moment,

450
00:33:25,733 --> 00:33:30,053
you simply don't have the
quality to fill the big offices of state.

451
00:33:30,173 --> 00:33:33,973
You need somebody with fighting
spirit, who can handle a tough interview,

452
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:38,254
and has blood rather
than sawdust in their veins.

453
00:33:49,935 --> 00:33:52,295
Stewart. Stewart! Stay awake.

454
00:33:52,415 --> 00:33:55,576
You alright? Come on.

455
00:34:07,577 --> 00:34:10,657
- I'm not going to make it.
- 'Course you are.

456
00:34:10,737 --> 00:34:12,657
'Course you are, mate, come on.

457
00:34:12,737 --> 00:34:15,057
Tell... Tell Jeanie...

458
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,698
- Tell...
- Who's Jeanie?

459
00:34:17,738 --> 00:34:19,658
Is she your wife?

460
00:34:19,738 --> 00:34:23,538
I'm so cold.

461
00:34:23,618 --> 00:34:26,579
Come on, mate. Come on, Stewart.

462
00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:33,099
Come on.

463
00:35:44,306 --> 00:35:47,747
We're at your disposal. Just
send us where you want us to go.

464
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:51,067
Who are these people, Fraser?

465
00:35:51,147 --> 00:35:54,267
Mods. That's
Audrey Hemmings' brother.

466
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:59,548
I think the press might be
interested in this one.

467
00:36:48,153 --> 00:36:50,713
- Yeah.
- We're in the clear.

468
00:36:50,753 --> 00:36:53,593
Leak it. Right now.

469
00:36:53,673 --> 00:36:57,234
In one of the more unexpected
moments in this tragedy,

470
00:36:57,274 --> 00:37:01,554
the communications gap is being
plugged with an army of volunteers.

471
00:37:01,634 --> 00:37:06,075
In this case, it's not so much
little ships as little scooters.

472
00:37:06,155 --> 00:37:08,955
A group organized by the brother
of one of the victims of the blast

473
00:37:09,075 --> 00:37:10,955
have offered their services

474
00:37:11,075 --> 00:37:13,755
in the struggle to keep data
moving between the different...

475
00:37:17,116 --> 00:37:18,636
News from London.

476
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:21,316
Cyber Unit have got a patch
for the emergency network.

477
00:37:21,396 --> 00:37:23,076
- Still no phones?
- No.

478
00:37:23,156 --> 00:37:25,717
They're playing whack-a-mole
with it right now.

479
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:27,677
God knows where
it's heading next.

480
00:37:28,277 --> 00:37:29,557
Thanks, Fraser.

481
00:37:31,437 --> 00:37:33,757
I'm truly sorry about Audrey.

482
00:37:34,557 --> 00:37:36,598
Thank you, Home Secretary.

483
00:37:36,678 --> 00:37:40,598
At least, now with some communication, the
rescue teams are getting back in the air.

484
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:45,118
He was such a good man.

485
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,159
At Christmas,
he wore this hat that lit up...

486
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:53,799
just to entertain the kids.

487
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,800
Everybody loved him.

488
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,641
He would've done
a favor for anyone.

489
00:38:10,281 --> 00:38:12,321
He...

490
00:38:12,401 --> 00:38:15,762
He was kind.
He was a kind man. He...

491
00:38:17,322 --> 00:38:20,122
He... He was...

492
00:38:20,202 --> 00:38:23,762
He couldn't fix
my roller skate, though.

493
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,846
Stewart? It's here.

494
00:38:57,926 --> 00:39:00,926
Stewart, it's here.
He's done it, he's made it.

495
00:39:02,046 --> 00:39:03,446
Stewart...

496
00:39:03,566 --> 00:39:06,287
We're safe, okay?
We're going home. We...

497
00:39:06,327 --> 00:39:08,567
You're not gonna die. Hey!

498
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,687
Hey, we're here! We're here!

499
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:17,568
Hey! Over here!
Over here!

500
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:03,092
Okay, first,
welcome back, Fraser.

501
00:40:03,172 --> 00:40:05,453
And thank you
for all your efforts.

502
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,493
We were delighted to hear that
Audrey Hemmings has been found alive.

503
00:40:13,613 --> 00:40:16,094
Thank you, Prime Minister.

504
00:40:16,174 --> 00:40:19,814
So, the, um, emergency services
are working normally again in Kent?

505
00:40:19,894 --> 00:40:24,094
They are. It's a basic clean-up
operation now, although, there is still

506
00:40:24,174 --> 00:40:26,175
a hell of a lot
still to clean up.

507
00:40:26,255 --> 00:40:29,335
We estimate we've lost
a third of the town's buildings,

508
00:40:29,415 --> 00:40:31,695
and the casualty rate
will continue to climb

509
00:40:31,775 --> 00:40:34,295
especially because of
the triage delays.

510
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:38,416
So, the cyber-attack has abated.

511
00:40:38,496 --> 00:40:40,856
The patch to ECON has worked,

512
00:40:40,936 --> 00:40:43,896
and we are able to
access the system again.

513
00:40:43,976 --> 00:40:45,697
Good to hear.

514
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,817
Retaliatory measures against
selected targets have been initiated.

515
00:40:48,897 --> 00:40:51,857
I have spoken to both the DTI
and Director of Communications.

516
00:40:51,937 --> 00:40:54,097
We are putting
the Jiayou contract on hold

517
00:40:54,177 --> 00:40:56,578
until we have had a full
investigation into the explosion.

518
00:40:56,658 --> 00:41:00,858
We need to dampen press speculation
and not link the two elements publicly.

519
00:41:00,938 --> 00:41:02,954
- Yes.
- Right now, they are more interested in the Singer Report,

520
00:41:02,978 --> 00:41:05,699
which unfortunately,
has been leaked.

521
00:41:05,779 --> 00:41:07,819
That is unfortunate.

522
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:10,619
Who could possibly have
a reason for doing that?

523
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:13,899
This has not

524
00:41:13,979 --> 00:41:16,660
been a tribute
to our preparation.

525
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,140
- Cyber-attacks are constantly...
- I'm not talking just about cyber-attacks.

526
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,500
- ...evolving...
- We have been made to look completely ridiculous.

527
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:28,421
Hopefully, these counter-measures
will put an end to this nonsense,

528
00:41:28,501 --> 00:41:31,941
and we can go back to the
painful job of cleaning up.

529
00:41:32,061 --> 00:41:37,142
I cannot promise to deliver
something outside my control.

530
00:41:37,222 --> 00:41:40,222
I can only work
to that objective.

531
00:41:40,302 --> 00:41:42,502
- Don't sack Eleanor.
- It's nothing personal.

532
00:41:42,622 --> 00:41:46,463
Don't sack her. I know people
want a head, don't give it to them.

533
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:49,863
- We've stabilized the situation.
- For now.

534
00:41:49,943 --> 00:41:51,879
Look, now that this
Singer Report is out of the way,

535
00:41:51,903 --> 00:41:54,863
there's something I really
need to discuss with you.

536
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:58,704
- Why am I getting the feeling I'm really not going to like it?
- Because you're not.

537
00:42:00,504 --> 00:42:04,304
- Hari Misra? What do you make of him?
- Ah, he's a cocky fuck.

538
00:42:04,344 --> 00:42:06,745
And he always seems to be
one step ahead of the press.

539
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:09,785
We can't ever be seen to be
weak on national security again.

540
00:42:09,865 --> 00:42:11,625
Yeah, that's what I said.

541
00:42:12,585 --> 00:42:14,745
Useful to know, though, so,

542
00:42:14,785 --> 00:42:16,706
y'know, keep him in earshot.

543
00:42:32,107 --> 00:42:35,948
Another scoop coming your way.
Destroy the drive when you're done.

544
00:42:37,508 --> 00:42:40,948
This arrived.

545
00:42:41,068 --> 00:42:43,908
Still trying to see if Paul
Mason's available for next week.

546
00:42:43,988 --> 00:42:45,108
Okay.

547
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:48,189
Jessica, shut the door please.

548
00:43:29,313 --> 00:43:31,713
There's loads of
weird shit going on.

549
00:43:31,793 --> 00:43:34,473
The killing, then the boat...

550
00:43:34,593 --> 00:43:36,610
- then the cyber-attack.
- - Who says they're connected?

551
00:43:36,634 --> 00:43:38,834
Now, what's their little game?

552
00:43:38,914 --> 00:43:41,594
What do you think caused the earth
tremors that made the ship go up?
