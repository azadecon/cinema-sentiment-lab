56
00:05:53,556 --> 00:05:56,247

So what if I don't have her now.
She breaks up and I'll be there.

you should mingle now."

Krishna!
- What?

109
00:12:04,577 --> 00:12:07,417
Why is your phone switched off?
Your father's been calling me.

110
00:12:08,537 --> 00:12:10,179
Why?
- Your grandma is very ill.

111
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:11,137

00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:23,384
You want to marry me.
Do you know Hindi?

187
00:17:24,064 --> 00:17:26,704
If you want to live in Mumbai,
you have to know Hindi.

188
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:29,464
Do you know Hindi?

189
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:32,384
Yes, I know Hindi.

190
00:17:33,624 --> 00:17:34,864
My mother is from Uttar Pradesh.

191
00:17:35,064 --> 00:17:37,024
My father hails from this village.

192
00:17:37,384 --> 00:17:39,727
I speak Hindi better than Tamil.

193
00:17:39,817 --> 00:17:41,264
What a twist!

194
00:17:42,154 --> 00:17:44,094
You don't know him.

195
00:17:44,184 --> 00:17:46,624
You should see how he parties.

196
00:17:47,064 --> 00:17:48,424
Whiskey...

197
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:50,704
Cigarettes...
Ladies...

198
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,784
If you still want to marry him...

199
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,384
It's up to you.

200
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:56,624
Punchline.

201
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,864
I am worried for you.

202
00:18:02,424 --> 00:18:04,808
You can still refuse to marry him.

203
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:07,944
Oh no! Her mother!

204
00:18:11,795 --> 00:18:13,224
This man is a drunkard.

205
00:18:14,372 --> 00:18:16,224
He wanted to hit our cows.

206
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:19,664
You told us that
when you refused to marry him.

207
00:18:21,048 --> 00:18:23,264
But he cares about you.

208
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:27,704
You won't find
a better life partner.

209
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:31,944
Alcohol damages the liver...

210
00:18:33,027 --> 00:18:34,704
But he is good at heart.

211
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,974
I had told you.
She's a nice girl.

212
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:40,744
I will offer a coconut
at the temple.

213
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,174
Hey! Nuisance!

214
00:18:49,264 --> 00:18:52,414
She had rejected me, but your
stupid idea spoiled everything.

215
00:18:52,504 --> 00:18:54,704
Look, the wedding
can't be cancelled,

216
00:18:54,824 --> 00:18:56,824
but can be postponed.
- How?

217
00:18:56,914 --> 00:18:59,094
If a member of
a close-knit family dies,

218
00:18:59,184 --> 00:19:00,584
no weddings are held for a year.

219
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:02,544
Yours is a close-knit family,
right? - Who will die?

220
00:19:02,824 --> 00:19:03,944
Your grandmother.

221
00:19:04,264 --> 00:19:06,384
She doesn't seem to want to die.

222
00:19:07,144 --> 00:19:08,144
She will die.

223
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:13,504
Hey!

224
00:19:14,864 --> 00:19:16,224
God!

226
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,184
You're so lucky, sir.

227
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:35,704
Her pulse rate is normal now.

'What about you?'

234
00:19:53,184 --> 00:19:55,624
'Nothing can stop
this wedding now.'

235
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,468
Mom.
- Take care.

236
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,467
Take care of yourself.

237
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,519
Goodbye.

238
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:07,519
Mind-blowing luck, my friend.
There's no escaping this now.

239
00:21:11,685 --> 00:21:13,639
This is what I get
for being a friend.

241
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:18,319

242
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,079
Amusing!
That's the India I'm looking for.

243
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:26,159
Can you pose?
- What? Excuse me.

244
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:28,839
What is happening here?
- Sorry.

245
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:32,479
Same t-shirt.

246
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:34,519
Alright. I should...
- Hey!

247
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:35,719
What do I do with her?

248
00:21:35,854 --> 00:21:36,759
Take her home.

249
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:40,119
I told my friends I'd marry
a modern girl. I'll get rid of her.

250
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:42,759
What! Where will the poor...
- I am the poor one.

251
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:44,719
What should we do?

252
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,639
Find another house to rent.

253
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,079
Take them.

254
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:50,189
Returning from your village?

255
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:53,039
She's from a village.
I'm from Germany.

256
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:54,079
Yeah, right.

257
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:56,879
I'm going to your house.
Find a house soon.

258
00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:07,879
Come on.

259
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:10,039
Walk ten steps behind me.

260
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:12,719
Why?

261
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,519
That's how
husbands and wives walk in Mumbai.

263
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:22,719
Wait.

264
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:36,599
Hello?
- I found a great flat.

265
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:38,719
Rs 15000 per month. In Matunga.

266
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,679
Fully furnished.
Should I finalise the deal?

267
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,879
Okay.

268
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:43,359
Message the address.

269
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,559
Advance?

270
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:46,039
You pay.
- You...

271
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:56,479
Excuse me.

272
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:58,199
Where is Green Gift building?

273
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,839
That one there.

274
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:01,159
Go there.

275
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:02,879
Which flat?
- 205.

276
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,039
205!

277
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,159
Sir, the new tenants.

278
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:14,039
They are a married couple.
- Hello.

279
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:15,639
1st floor, 205.

280
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:17,314
He has told you
about the house, right?

281
00:23:17,404 --> 00:23:18,594
Yes, I told them.

282
00:23:18,684 --> 00:23:19,639
Okay, sir.
- Okay.

283
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,319
No lift?

284
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,519
Sir, please give me the key.

285
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:36,919
Sir, this is the flat.

286
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:37,999
Excuse me.

287
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:39,719
What is this?

288
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,079
You took the rent in advance.
You should've cleaned it at least.

289
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:48,069
You got such a huge flat
for that amount.

290
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,239
Be happy, sir.

291
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:50,799

- Thank you, sir.

00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:51,839

00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:58,559
I'll get some food. Stay here.

294
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:25,959
It's our house. Come in.
- What!

295
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:27,559
Of course, you are here.

296
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,239
Who cleaned the house?

297
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:30,479
I did.

298
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:32,879
On your own?
- Yes.

299
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:34,239
Can't believe it.

300
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:37,359
Don't you require help?

301
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:39,319
There's no need. I'll manage.

302
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:42,479
The food is ready. Eat it.

303
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:45,759
You cooked food?

304
00:25:46,152 --> 00:25:48,119
I cooked with
what I brought from the village.

305
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:01,759
You didn't make pudding?

306
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,719

307
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:10,203
Not fit for humans.

308
00:26:10,293 --> 00:26:11,789
I won't eat.
- Yes.

Chinese food, butter chicken...

00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:23,559
How do you put up with this?
- Wait!

315
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:27,439
Go back to the village
and learn how to cook those dishes.

316
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,479
Take your time. Go.

Why didn't you bring this earlier?

320
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:50,639
Did you want to eat it alone?

321
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,559
We won't eat...

322
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,519

Grandma!

337
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:02,439
What?

338
00:28:04,879 --> 00:28:06,082
Too late.

339
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,959
Are these fresh?
- Yes.

Are you new to the area?
- Yes.

- Krishna, your passes.

350

I don't want them.
- Have you lost it?

351
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:43,589

is sponsoring film awards.

352

We will get to see the film stars
up close and personal.

353

There'll be an after party too.
Models, actresses...

without grammar mistakes.

Once you get on the dance floor,

356
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,959
you're sure to impress
one at least. - No.

357
00:28:57,049 --> 00:28:58,119
I'm not in the mood.

358
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:00,439
Don't worry.
You'll find a modern girl.

359
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,559
You didn't just shift
out of the house, you've changed.

00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:15,079

"Set the floor on fire."

369
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:35,759
"Your eyes are mesmerising."

370
00:29:35,879 --> 00:29:38,879
"Your eyes are mesmerising."

371
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,439
"You're the one
who stole my heart."

372
00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:45,519
"You're the one
who stole my heart."

373
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:49,079
"My beloved, my darling."

374
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,479
"Give me a chance."

375
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:55,879
"Come to me, my darling."

376
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:58,239
"Let us romance."

377
00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:00,839
"I love the way you dance."

378
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,759
"Dance, dance, dance, dance."

379
00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:05,159
"Dance, dance, dance, dance.
Dance, dance."

380
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:07,799
"I love the way you dance.
"Dance, dance, dance, dance.

381
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,519
"Dance, dance, dance, dance."

382
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:12,439
"Dance, dance, dance, dance.
Dance, dance."

383
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,119
"I will flex my muscles"

384
00:30:15,239 --> 00:30:17,999
"and beat up those who look at you.
My six-pack abs I will gift wrap"

385
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:19,999
"and gift them to you
on Valentine's Day."

386
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:23,399
"You'll never see one like me,
all over the world."

387
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:25,359
"I am a Punjabi..."

388
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:26,789
"Straight away from Moga."

389
00:30:26,879 --> 00:30:30,159
"Chin, chin, chin,
listen to me, ma'am."

390
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:33,559
"Chin, chin, chin,
why do you torture me?"

391
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,039
"Chin, chin, chin,
O, shake your bum."

392
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:40,439
"Have mercy on the men
that love you."

393
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,159
"Dance, dance, dance, dance."

394
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:45,399
"Dance, dance, dance, dance.
I love the way you dance."

395
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,279
"Dance, dance, dance, dance."

396
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:48,999
"Dance, dance, dance, dance."

397
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,839
"Dance, dance, dance, dance."

398
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:01,279
Coffee.

399
00:31:11,926 --> 00:31:13,119
What is this?

400
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:15,919
My company is sponsoring an
awards' show. Passes to the show.

401
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:20,799
May I go with you?

402
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,439
It was the first time
you asked for something,

403
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:31,039
that is why I agreed.

404
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:34,399
Listen carefully.

405
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,959
At the venue, we won't be together.

406
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:40,359
We'll sit separately.

407
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:41,839
After the function,

408
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:44,519
you'll go to the ladies toilet,
I'll go to the gents toilet.

409
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:48,359
After everyone leaves,
we'll go home. Okay?

410
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,719
Not one question.

411
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,599
This is good.

412
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,599
That was later.

413
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:05,199
He had chicken-pox at this age.

414
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,679
Here.

415
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,079
Such a cartoon!

416
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:12,399
Krishna.

417
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:14,319
You said you wouldn't be here.

418
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,919
Moving on to the next category...

419
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:23,799
Nominations for Best Director
for Truedeal Awards 2016 are...

420
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:27,319
'What...'

421
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,519
'Where is she sitting?'

422
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,599
Thank you.

423
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:37,559
I didn't make this film alone.

424
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,639
Raj supported me a lot.

425
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:41,759
He's like my brother.
Thank you, Raj.

426
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:45,679
What an award...

427
00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:48,479
Place where hard work...

428
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:51,719
The girl sitting next to you
is gorgeous.

429
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,789
Seems like a village girl
and is here alone.

430
00:32:53,879 --> 00:32:55,359
'Best Film of the year...'
- Exchange seats with me.

431
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:57,039
You're not interested, let me...
- Hey!

432
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,519
Just because she's alone,
you'll behave like this?

433
00:33:00,691 --> 00:33:02,839
Stop it. Respect women.

434
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:04,759
It could be your friend's wife.

435
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:06,999
Could we have on stage,
the chairman of Truedeal...

436
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,399
He's not interested,
he won't let us enjoy either.

437
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:13,319
And the Best Actor goes to...
Raj Khanna...

438
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:16,199
For Revolver Raja 002.

439
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,279
Everyone has dreams.

440
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,239
But dreams come true for those
who work to realise their dreams.

441
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,999
I was one in a crowd,
then one in thousands...

442
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:42,599
And today...

443
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,599
I am one in a million.

444
00:33:45,203 --> 00:33:47,119
Super, sir.
- So, go for your dreams...

445
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:48,159
No matter what.

446
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:52,439
In life,
play your role with dedication.

447
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,719
Even after the curtain falls,

448
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:57,319
the applause will continue.

449
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:01,679
Come on.

450
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:05,029
Raj Khanna...
I've seen all his movies.

451
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:06,479
I'm a huge fan.

452
00:34:09,279 --> 00:34:11,199
What are you doing here?
- Just hanging out.

453
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,759
Let's go to the party.

454
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,079
I'm tired. I'll go home.

455
00:34:14,279 --> 00:34:16,175
Are you crazy? You're refusing to
go for the party?

456
00:34:16,265 --> 00:34:17,239
Don't insist!

457
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:18,519
I told you I'm tired.

458
00:34:18,894 --> 00:34:20,079
What's with him?
- Yes.

459
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,679
'Where is she going?'

460
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:24,159
'To the after-party!'

461
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,439
You took that seriously, right?
- Yes.

462
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,719
Just for gags. Come on.
- You're too much.

463
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,799
Lift!

464
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:33,399
Oh gosh!

465
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,239
My wife!

466
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:28,799
"Hey ya."

467
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:34,719
"Dance like this..."

468
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:38,359
"Like Sridevi."

469
00:35:39,879 --> 00:35:43,599
"Dance like this..."

470
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:47,519
"Like Sridevi."

471
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:51,319
"I'm in Bollywood.
My story is unique."

472
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:54,639
"My youth entices one and all."

473
00:35:54,759 --> 00:35:55,999
"Shake it."

474
00:35:58,479 --> 00:36:00,919
"Baby."

475
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:04,119
"Dance like this."

476
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,839
"Sing like this."

477
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:12,039
Who is she?

478
00:36:13,759 --> 00:36:14,599
Don't know, sir.

479
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:20,959
"Yeah."

480
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:24,679
"Yeah."

481
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:28,999
"Yeah."

482
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,319
"Money, money, money, money."

483
00:36:33,439 --> 00:36:37,119
"I am popular everywhere I go."

484
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:40,759
"My beauty is magical."

485
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:44,719
"I am like a shining star."

486
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:49,119
"Stay around and clap your hands."

487
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,079
"Dance like this."

488
00:36:58,439 --> 00:37:00,959
"Sing like this."

489
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:13,159
"Check it out, yo."

490
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,719
"Rhythm on the bass, man."

491
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,439
"Jump it up."

492
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,639
"Dance like this..."

493
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:35,719
"Like Sridevi."

494
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:45,119
"Dance like this."

495
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:52,759
"Sing like this."

496
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,199
What... Oh no...

497
00:38:50,279 --> 00:38:51,279
What?

498
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:54,319
What did you do to me?

499
00:38:54,439 --> 00:38:56,399
What! You're asking me!

500
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:59,399
My sari is torn.

501
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:02,199
I thought you were a decent man.

502
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:05,119
You... Your sari... You think I...

503
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:07,429
Then what?

504
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:09,879
Where did you take me?
What did you give me?

505
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:12,919
I have a headache.

506
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:17,559
Forget that.

507
00:39:17,879 --> 00:39:18,839
Come on.

508
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:20,422
No.

509
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:24,359
I'll bathe first,
and recite a holy verse ten times.

510
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,159
Only then will I start the day.

511
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:31,969
Hey! Right.

512
00:39:41,027 --> 00:39:42,154
Ramu, call ma'am here.

513
00:39:42,919 --> 00:39:44,531
Ramu!
- Excuse me.

514
00:39:44,621 --> 00:39:45,666
Who is the ma'am?

515
00:39:46,434 --> 00:39:47,994
I am Mr Raj Khanna's manager.

516
00:39:48,194 --> 00:39:49,194
Sir has sent me here.

517
00:39:49,914 --> 00:39:50,874
Call ma'am here.

518
00:39:53,194 --> 00:39:55,104
There's no ma'am here. Please go.

519
00:39:55,242 --> 00:39:56,514
Hey, ma'am...

520
00:39:57,018 --> 00:39:57,954
Ma'am.

521
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:03,434
The industry is talking about ma'am
and you...

522
00:40:03,914 --> 00:40:05,594
Call her here.
- Wrong address.

523
00:40:06,194 --> 00:40:09,194
There's just a 'sir' here,
no 'ma'am'.

524
00:40:09,418 --> 00:40:11,194
Okay? Please.

525
00:40:11,434 --> 00:40:13,994
Last night, ma'am took a taxi
from the hotel and came here.

526
00:40:14,127 --> 00:40:16,824
I had a hard time convincing the
taxi driver to give me the address,

527
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,194
and you say she isn't here.

528
00:40:18,434 --> 00:40:19,594
Call her out.

529
00:40:20,674 --> 00:40:22,064
I told you she's not here.

530
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:23,274
If she's here, where is she?

531
00:40:23,594 --> 00:40:24,834
I am here.

532
00:40:29,926 --> 00:40:30,874
Ma'am.

533
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:35,834
I am fortunate indeed.

534
00:40:36,084 --> 00:40:37,474
What a performance it was!

535
00:40:38,034 --> 00:40:38,994
What a smile!

536
00:40:39,162 --> 00:40:41,514
You dance so well, so graceful.

537
00:40:41,715 --> 00:40:44,104
I have two groups for you,
on WhatsApp.

538
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:46,344
'Future Sridevi',
'Future Madhuri Dixit'.

539
00:40:46,434 --> 00:40:48,864
Everyone in the industry
wants to sign you for a film,

540
00:40:48,954 --> 00:40:50,280
but who got here first?

541
00:40:50,374 --> 00:40:52,324
Dilip Kukreja, star secretary.
- Excuse me.

542
00:40:52,414 --> 00:40:53,684
Stop this nonsense!

543
00:40:53,774 --> 00:40:55,884
Come out.
- Shut up! Get lost!

544
00:40:55,974 --> 00:40:58,164
Who is this mad man? We're talking
and he's interrupting us.

545
00:40:58,254 --> 00:40:59,084
He is...
- Hey, mister!

546
00:40:59,174 --> 00:41:00,084
My manager.

547
00:41:00,174 --> 00:41:01,174
What!

548
00:41:01,654 --> 00:41:03,884
Manager! - Manager!
You appointed one already!

549
00:41:03,974 --> 00:41:05,804
Superb, ma'am. Very good, ma'am.

550
00:41:05,894 --> 00:41:06,854
I...
- Hey, Get up.

551
00:41:07,294 --> 00:41:08,294
Get up, I say.

552
00:41:09,614 --> 00:41:11,254
Can't you show some respect?

553
00:41:11,574 --> 00:41:12,614
Mad fellow.

554
00:41:13,414 --> 00:41:15,654
Ma'am, Mr Khanna has decided,

555
00:41:15,814 --> 00:41:16,804
in fact he insists

556
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:19,376
that you will be the lead actress
in his next film.

557
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:20,404
Actress!

558
00:41:20,494 --> 00:41:21,494
Yes.
- Leave!

559
00:41:24,494 --> 00:41:25,574
Sir has said

560
00:41:25,974 --> 00:41:28,294
that if you refuse to do the film,
he won't act in it.

561
00:41:29,134 --> 00:41:30,734
Please, ma'am.
Okay, ma'am?

562
00:41:31,494 --> 00:41:32,524
I'll think about it.

563
00:41:32,614 --> 00:41:34,164
Super, ma'am. That is enough.

564
00:41:34,254 --> 00:41:36,334
I'll call Mr Khanna and tell him.

565
00:41:36,611 --> 00:41:38,844
Hello, sir. Ma'am has agreed.

566
00:41:38,934 --> 00:41:40,484
We'll have her sign on Friday
and start shooting immediately.

567
00:41:40,574 --> 00:41:42,334
You speak to her.
Hold on.

568
00:41:42,954 --> 00:41:44,134
Ma'am, Mr Raj Khanna.

569
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:49,374
Hello?
- Hi.

570
00:41:51,347 --> 00:41:52,934
I saw you at
the award function last night.

571
00:41:56,174 --> 00:41:57,574
It was proved

572
00:41:58,174 --> 00:41:59,934
that stars
are meant to shine bright,

573
00:42:00,734 --> 00:42:03,934
and are visible to the world.

574
00:42:04,974 --> 00:42:06,454
Welcome to the world of dreams.

575
00:42:07,294 --> 00:42:09,134
You're lucky.
- You too.

576
00:42:11,134 --> 00:42:12,614
See you on the sets.

577
00:42:14,454 --> 00:42:15,574
Thank you, ma'am.

578
00:42:25,694 --> 00:42:27,215
What is your problem?

579
00:42:27,392 --> 00:42:29,494
You're sitting on a gold mine
and are behaving stupid.

580
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,257
Listen carefully.

581
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:34,004
I will take care of ma'am's dates,
agreements and finances.

582
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:35,574
You just act like her manager.

583
00:42:35,894 --> 00:42:37,894
I will give you
5% of the earnings as commission.

584
00:42:39,186 --> 00:42:40,134
Commission?

585
00:42:40,743 --> 00:42:42,524
You'll give it to me! Hey...

586
00:42:42,614 --> 00:42:45,134
What?
You want a share in the profits?

587
00:42:47,054 --> 00:42:50,534
I'll send a car here on Friday.
Bring ma'am to the location.

588
00:42:50,814 --> 00:42:52,094
I'll manage the rest.

589
00:42:54,254 --> 00:42:55,534
The producer, Sharma...

590
00:42:55,814 --> 00:42:58,284
He'll find the address and
come here to sign ma'am for a film.

591
00:42:58,374 --> 00:43:00,054
What!
- If he comes here...

592
00:43:00,174 --> 00:43:03,134
Like you told me, no one lives
here, bachelors share this house.

593
00:43:03,694 --> 00:43:05,974
Tell him that with confidence.

594
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,294
He's foolish. He'll believe you.

595
00:43:11,694 --> 00:43:13,614
The car will be here
at 10 on Friday.

596
00:43:29,655 --> 00:43:32,054
Who were you talking to?

597
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:33,414
What?

598
00:43:43,374 --> 00:43:44,814
You haven't had a bath yet?

599
00:43:45,094 --> 00:43:45,977
What?

600
00:43:46,572 --> 00:43:49,254
Have a bath
and recite the holy verse 5 times.

601
00:43:49,654 --> 00:43:50,534
Alright?

602
00:43:56,454 --> 00:43:57,320
Hey!

603
00:43:58,334 --> 00:43:59,494
What do you think?

604
00:44:00,374 --> 00:44:01,614
Are you fooling me?

605
00:44:01,794 --> 00:44:02,974
You dance.

606
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,654
You wear skimpy clothes.

607
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,444
You speak in English.

608
00:44:08,534 --> 00:44:09,854
You change every minute.

609
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:12,934
Why are you doing this?

610
00:44:13,134 --> 00:44:14,174
What is the plan?

611
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:16,974
Are you an undercover cop?

612
00:44:18,054 --> 00:44:19,334
Say something.

613
00:44:21,814 --> 00:44:23,534
I understand.
- What do you understand?

614
00:44:25,334 --> 00:44:27,574
You don't like me.

615
00:44:28,392 --> 00:44:29,654
She is...

616
00:44:30,512 --> 00:44:32,814
'Don't walk close to me.
Don't sit with me.'

617
00:44:34,844 --> 00:44:36,934
I thought things would change.

618
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,324
You want to throw me out of the
house by accusing me of all this.

619
00:44:42,414 --> 00:44:44,334
Hey! Me!

620
00:44:44,934 --> 00:44:47,854
Don't take the trouble. I'll go.

621
00:44:49,014 --> 00:44:50,294
You be happy.

622
00:44:50,494 --> 00:44:53,574
Excuse me.
Why are you calling your father?

623
00:44:54,894 --> 00:44:57,014
Not my father,
I'm calling your father.

624
00:45:01,174 --> 00:45:02,374
What did I say to you?

625
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:05,494
This is normal in a family.

626
00:45:07,094 --> 00:45:08,094
Cook food.

627
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,374
Go.

628
00:45:09,694 --> 00:45:10,894
Cook some food.

629
00:45:12,534 --> 00:45:13,364
What?

630
00:45:13,454 --> 00:45:14,654
You don't want me
to go to the village?

631
00:45:15,334 --> 00:45:16,254
No.

632
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:17,934
Not now.

633
00:45:45,134 --> 00:45:46,294
Hello, sir.

634
00:45:57,134 --> 00:45:58,884
When I asked you the address,

635
00:45:58,974 --> 00:46:01,084
seemed like you wanted to say
something about Flat 205.

636
00:46:01,174 --> 00:46:03,854
Sir, you rented the house
without inquiring about it.

637
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:04,964
What?

638
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,894
A girl named Ruby lived there.
She was a model.

639
00:46:09,242 --> 00:46:11,174
She wanted to be an actress.

640
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:13,094
It's not easy.

641
00:46:13,674 --> 00:46:15,454
She was a nice girl.

642
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:17,054
She stayed aloof.

643
00:46:17,214 --> 00:46:18,614
She suffered from depression,
I think.

644
00:46:19,426 --> 00:46:21,209
She committed suicide.

645
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:23,574
The police was here.
A case was registered.

646
00:46:23,977 --> 00:46:25,774
The house was locked
till you rented it.

647
00:48:03,494 --> 00:48:04,614
What did you hear?

648
00:48:05,071 --> 00:48:06,164
Ghost stories.

649
00:48:06,312 --> 00:48:07,164
Why?

650
00:48:07,357 --> 00:48:08,644
Those are just stories.

651
00:48:08,792 --> 00:48:09,694
There are no ghosts.

652
00:48:09,894 --> 00:48:12,084
Tinkling of anklets...
A touch...

653
00:48:12,174 --> 00:48:14,854
It's not true.
You are educated.

654
00:48:15,071 --> 00:48:16,271
Don't believe all this.

655
00:48:44,071 --> 00:48:45,031
Devi!

656
00:48:47,151 --> 00:48:48,671
What are you doing there?

657
00:48:54,671 --> 00:48:56,351
Watch the TV in the house.

658
00:48:58,311 --> 00:48:59,111
Devi.

659
00:49:00,391 --> 00:49:01,591
I'm talking to you.

660
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:03,231
Devi.

661
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:06,951
Devi.

662
00:49:09,191 --> 00:49:10,111
De...

663
00:49:23,311 --> 00:49:24,351
Ruby.

664
00:50:12,311 --> 00:50:13,271
What happened?

665
00:50:15,351 --> 00:50:16,391
A dream.

666
00:50:18,271 --> 00:50:19,471
Don't you have to go to office?

667
00:50:19,991 --> 00:50:21,471
Get ready. I'll bring coffee.

668
00:50:24,391 --> 00:50:25,631
Ruby.

669
00:50:26,991 --> 00:50:29,551
Ru...

670
00:50:39,711 --> 00:50:41,661
Our Father in heaven.

671
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:44,031
Holy is Your name.
Our Father in heaven.

672
00:50:45,711 --> 00:50:46,751
Who is Ruby?

673
00:50:52,231 --> 00:50:53,831
A colleague is getting married.

674
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:57,111
Should I give him gold or a ruby?

675
00:51:03,271 --> 00:51:04,231
Let's go.

676
00:51:08,551 --> 00:51:09,951
Where?
- Picnic.

677
00:51:10,511 --> 00:51:11,621
A Mumbai tour.

678
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:13,631
Why?

679
00:51:18,591 --> 00:51:19,631
Surprise.

680
00:51:20,671 --> 00:51:22,401
Yes.
- For how many days?

681
00:51:23,071 --> 00:51:24,181
4-5 days.

682
00:51:24,271 --> 00:51:25,831
Pack everything.

683
00:51:25,951 --> 00:51:27,381
So many things for 4-5 days?

684
00:51:27,471 --> 00:51:28,791
Will you get ready now?

685
00:51:32,871 --> 00:51:34,831
You won't understand.

686
00:51:35,311 --> 00:51:36,183
Please.

687
00:51:37,231 --> 00:51:38,111
Are you here?

688
00:51:38,311 --> 00:51:39,311
Yes, that's the address.

689
00:51:40,151 --> 00:51:41,271
I'm coming.

690
00:51:41,751 --> 00:51:42,551
Are you ready?

691
00:51:42,991 --> 00:51:44,031
I'm coming.

692
00:51:49,271 --> 00:51:50,991
The boot...
- I'll keep it.

693
00:52:01,711 --> 00:52:02,631
Devi!

694
00:52:04,831 --> 00:52:05,671
Devi!

695
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,671
Devi!

696
00:52:16,031 --> 00:52:17,951
The bags are back on the cupboard.

697
00:52:21,831 --> 00:52:24,071
What's wrong?
You didn't go to work?

698
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,151
You changed?

699
00:52:29,231 --> 00:52:30,541
You were getting ready,
weren't you?

700
00:52:30,631 --> 00:52:32,541
Why? Where are we going?

701
00:52:32,631 --> 00:52:34,221
For a holiday.

702
00:52:34,311 --> 00:52:36,381
Oh! For how many days?

703
00:52:36,471 --> 00:52:37,390
Huh!

704
00:52:38,666 --> 00:52:39,631
Many days.

705
00:52:41,711 --> 00:52:43,511
Should I pack everything?

706
00:52:45,431 --> 00:52:46,671
Yes.

707
00:52:48,911 --> 00:52:49,951
Please...

708
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:52,191
Yes.

709
00:52:57,831 --> 00:52:58,831
And...

710
00:52:59,151 --> 00:53:00,391
That one too.

711
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:22,391
Hurry up.

712
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,551
The luggage...
- Let's go.

713
00:53:30,191 --> 00:53:31,471
Careful.

714
00:53:38,351 --> 00:53:39,631
Stay here. I'll be back.

715
00:53:40,911 --> 00:53:42,711
Did anyone
take the luggage upstairs?

716
00:53:42,871 --> 00:53:43,791
No, sir.

717
00:53:51,471 --> 00:53:52,751
What happened?

718
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:54,939
You didn't go to work?

719
00:53:56,311 --> 00:53:57,631
Listen...

720
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,098
No, no.

721
00:54:10,071 --> 00:54:11,031
Sir...

722
00:54:11,231 --> 00:54:12,191
Ma'am...

723
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:15,231
Sir, I... Ghost...

724
00:54:25,711 --> 00:54:26,671
Sir.

725
00:54:27,231 --> 00:54:28,129
Sir.

726
00:54:29,151 --> 00:54:29,951
Sir!

727
00:54:30,751 --> 00:54:31,991
Sir, please.

728
00:54:32,151 --> 00:54:33,831
Sir! Sir!

729
00:54:34,151 --> 00:54:35,022
Sir!

730
00:54:37,151 --> 00:54:38,311
'In my house...'

731
00:54:38,991 --> 00:54:40,071
How...

732
00:54:50,271 --> 00:54:51,391
Are you ready?

733
00:54:53,191 --> 00:54:54,231
Coffee.

734
00:54:55,991 --> 00:54:57,231
Take it.

735
00:55:21,911 --> 00:55:22,911
What is this?

736
00:55:23,271 --> 00:55:24,511
He's the one.

737
00:55:25,391 --> 00:55:26,391
My wife.

738
00:55:35,991 --> 00:55:36,871
Who are they?

739
00:55:36,991 --> 00:55:39,191
They are here
to conduct a prayer ritual.

740
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:41,071
These people perform
prayer rituals!

741
00:55:42,351 --> 00:55:44,541
If we'd told father,
he would've sent a priest.

742
00:55:44,631 --> 00:55:46,991
There was no time. Get coffee.
- Cof...

743
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:07,871
Sir...

744
00:56:09,111 --> 00:56:10,271
Has the ghost left?

745
00:56:10,631 --> 00:56:11,460
Huh?

746
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,141
It has gone.

747
00:56:13,231 --> 00:56:14,471
It won't come back, will it?

748
00:56:15,882 --> 00:56:17,101
Test.

749
00:56:17,191 --> 00:56:18,071
What?

750
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,351
Ruby.

751
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:35,431
Ruby.

752
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:43,751
Why are you calling the ghost back?

753
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,141
Sorry.

754
00:56:45,231 --> 00:56:48,421
"Dance, dance, dance, dance.
I love the way you dance."

755
00:56:48,511 --> 00:56:50,621
"Dance, dance, dance, dance."

756
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:53,763
"Dance, dance, dance, dance."

757
00:56:53,957 --> 00:56:55,716
"I love the way you dance."

758
00:56:55,806 --> 00:56:58,191
"Dance, dance, dance, dance."

759
00:56:58,351 --> 00:57:00,621
"Dance, dance, dance, dance."

760
00:57:00,711 --> 00:57:02,101
"I love the way you dance."

761
00:57:02,191 --> 00:57:05,061
"Dance, dance, dance, dance."

762
00:57:05,151 --> 00:57:07,871
"Dance, dance, dance, dance."

763
00:57:08,071 --> 00:57:09,471
"I love the way you dance."

764
00:58:13,231 --> 00:58:14,271
Help!

765
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,951
This is my house.

766
00:58:30,151 --> 00:58:32,031
You came here without
my permission,

767
00:58:33,431 --> 00:58:34,671
but you cannot leave now.

768
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:36,391
What do you want?

769
00:58:38,471 --> 00:58:40,271
Why have you possessed Devi?

770
00:58:40,977 --> 00:58:42,751
I was a struggling actress.

771
00:58:44,911 --> 00:58:46,791
After years of struggle,

772
00:58:47,071 --> 00:58:49,071
I got a chance
to act with Raj Khanna.

773
00:58:50,673 --> 00:58:52,991
It would've been
the debut film for both of us.

774
00:58:54,271 --> 00:58:56,711
But I was thrown out of the film.

775
00:58:58,671 --> 00:59:00,187
If I had acted in that film,

776
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:03,351
I too, would've been
a star like Raj Khanna.

777
00:59:04,951 --> 00:59:07,391
Anger, frustration, depression.

778
00:59:09,336 --> 00:59:11,591
One wrong decision...

779
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:13,271
All my dreams were shattered.

780
00:59:16,071 --> 00:59:18,391
God has given me an opportunity,
through Devi,

781
00:59:19,871 --> 00:59:22,111
to show the world who Ruby is.

782
00:59:24,951 --> 00:59:27,551
No one can stop me
from acting in the film.

783
00:59:29,871 --> 00:59:31,671
If anyone tries to,

784
00:59:32,711 --> 00:59:34,791
I will ruin that person's life.

785
00:59:35,911 --> 00:59:36,791
Devi!

786
00:59:37,111 --> 00:59:38,071
Movie!

787
00:59:38,391 --> 00:59:39,391
I won't accept that.

788
00:59:39,551 --> 00:59:41,471
I didn't ask for your permission,

789
00:59:42,551 --> 00:59:44,071
I stated my decision.

790
00:59:44,991 --> 00:59:47,071
I won't disturb Devi in the house.

791
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,951
You cannot disturb Ruby
outside the house.

792
00:59:52,671 --> 00:59:55,511
Tomorrow at 10 am, Raj Khanna
will send a car to pick me up.

793
00:59:57,271 --> 00:59:59,781
It's your responsibility
to take Devi out of the house.

794
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,751
Me!

795
01:00:02,471 --> 01:00:03,991
You're my manager, after all.

796
01:00:13,231 --> 01:00:14,271
What's wrong?

797
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:16,551
You haven't slept yet?

798
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:17,871
Want something to eat?

799
01:00:18,191 --> 01:00:19,231
What?

800
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,591
Who are you now?

801
01:00:21,991 --> 01:00:23,671
What are you saying?

802
01:00:24,231 --> 01:00:25,231
It's late.

803
01:00:25,671 --> 01:00:26,751
Go to sleep.

804
01:00:38,174 --> 01:00:39,334
What's wrong?

805
01:00:40,254 --> 01:00:41,574
You are pacing about.

806
01:00:42,974 --> 01:00:44,894
Don't you have to go to office?
- No, ma'am.

807
01:00:45,889 --> 01:00:47,694
I have cooked only for myself.

808
01:00:48,654 --> 01:00:50,334
If I knew...
- Krishna!

809
01:00:50,774 --> 01:00:51,814
It's 10!

810
01:00:51,959 --> 01:00:53,774
Will you take Devi out or should I?

811
01:00:53,864 --> 01:00:57,720
I can make okra, but you don't like
it, so I can cook something else.

812
01:00:59,503 --> 01:01:00,887
Nothing.
- What?

813
01:01:02,014 --> 01:01:03,331
Where?
- Picnic.

814
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:06,734
You always say we'll go,
but we never go.

815
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:10,734
Let me take my clothes.
Wait. Listen.

816
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:21,534
"Get a reason to live."

817
01:01:21,734 --> 01:01:24,574
"Make life colourful."

818
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:29,974
"Soar high in the sky."

819
01:01:30,174 --> 01:01:32,974
"Enjoy every moment."

820
01:01:33,094 --> 01:01:35,894
"Don't stop."

821
01:01:36,414 --> 01:01:42,534
"Live life to the fullest."

822
01:01:47,494 --> 01:01:49,556
She's not an actress.
She's my wife.

823
01:01:49,646 --> 01:01:50,934
She's possessed by a spirit.

824
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:52,694
Listen...

825
01:01:52,854 --> 01:01:54,694
She's not an actress.
She's my wife.

826
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:57,534
She's possessed by a spirit.
- Please drive faster.

827
01:01:57,654 --> 01:01:58,574
Yes, ma'am!

828
01:01:58,934 --> 01:02:00,374
'He can't hear me.'

829
01:02:00,734 --> 01:02:01,934
'She must've done something.'

830
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:14,550
"Colour, beauty..."

831
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:19,480
"Colour, beauty..."

832
01:02:19,759 --> 01:02:25,120
"This world is beautiful."

833
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:30,720
"I want to rule the world."

834
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:36,360
"There's beauty all around."

835
01:02:36,631 --> 01:02:41,791
"Let me admire the beauty."
- Welcome.

836
01:02:41,911 --> 01:02:44,351
"Get a reason to live."

837
01:02:44,551 --> 01:02:47,609
"Make life colourful."

838
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:49,271
So, ladies and gentlemen...

839
01:02:49,471 --> 01:02:53,167
Here is the lead actress
of Revolver Raja 3, Ruby Singh.

840
01:02:54,431 --> 01:02:55,911
We should've signed her
for our film.

841
01:02:56,391 --> 01:02:57,351
We missed it.

842
01:02:57,471 --> 01:02:58,511
Wow!

843
01:02:58,631 --> 01:03:00,831
She's gorgeous.
- Who?

844
01:03:00,951 --> 01:03:03,431
The actress.
She's the next superstar.

845
01:03:05,391 --> 01:03:06,431
She's not an actress.

846
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,311
She's my wife.

847
01:03:08,871 --> 01:03:10,751
She's possessed by a spirit.

848
01:03:13,551 --> 01:03:14,991
You can't hear me, can you?

849
01:03:16,471 --> 01:03:18,591
Not Hema Malini, Sridevi.

850
01:03:19,511 --> 01:03:20,831
Lights!

851
01:03:21,311 --> 01:03:22,711
First shot!

852
01:03:41,855 --> 01:03:42,831
All in.

853
01:03:50,031 --> 01:03:51,591
It's Lady Luck.

854
01:03:51,751 --> 01:03:53,711
A beautiful woman wins hearts.

855
01:03:54,871 --> 01:03:56,969
An intelligent
woman wins accolades.

856
01:03:58,181 --> 01:04:00,735
A woman who has
beauty and brains...

857
01:04:02,391 --> 01:04:03,631
Wins the world.

858
01:04:03,831 --> 01:04:04,733
Cut it!

859
01:04:04,951 --> 01:04:06,271
Superb, sir! Superb!

860
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:18,111
You're a star.

861
01:04:19,304 --> 01:04:20,231
I know.

862
01:04:20,951 --> 01:04:21,831
Born star.

863
01:04:27,471 --> 01:04:28,831
Reborn star.

864
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:35,631
Sir...

865
01:04:36,111 --> 01:04:38,211
What a pair!
Super hit. Mind-blowing.

866
01:04:38,831 --> 01:04:43,621
I already have the feeling that
the film will be a super duper hit.

867
01:04:43,711 --> 01:04:44,751
Hail Goddess!

868
01:04:46,111 --> 01:04:47,181
Hail Goddess!
- Dilip.

869
01:04:47,271 --> 01:04:48,231
Yes?

870
01:04:48,591 --> 01:04:51,511
The film industry
is a dazzling world.

871
01:04:52,551 --> 01:04:53,511
Yes, sir.

872
01:04:53,631 --> 01:04:55,031
The lights you see here...

873
01:04:55,751 --> 01:04:57,471
There's darkness behind them.

874
01:04:58,751 --> 01:05:01,471
The journey from the darkness
into the light

875
01:05:02,111 --> 01:05:03,791
is a short journey.

876
01:05:05,031 --> 01:05:09,431
But often this short journey
takes years to complete.

877
01:05:10,511 --> 01:05:11,791
It took me 14 years.

878
01:05:12,791 --> 01:05:15,231
Many a time,
it may take a lifetime.

879
01:05:16,271 --> 01:05:17,951
What a profound thought!

880
01:05:18,071 --> 01:05:19,871
A lifetime.
You're right, sir.

881
01:05:22,031 --> 01:05:23,911
I have always rejected offers
to act in romantic films.

882
01:05:25,791 --> 01:05:26,710
But...

883
01:05:27,231 --> 01:05:30,751
For the first time,
I didn't want the scene to end.

884
01:05:31,471 --> 01:05:33,071
I know what you mean.

885
01:05:33,511 --> 01:05:35,431
Hail Goddess!
You're a rockstar, sir.

886
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:36,791
I'll be back.

887
01:05:40,152 --> 01:05:41,287
Krishna!

888
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:43,831
It's done, right?
Where's ma'am?

889
01:05:44,161 --> 01:05:45,609
We have to go.
- Krishna, wait.

890
01:05:46,191 --> 01:05:48,471
It's not done.
The good times

891
01:05:48,631 --> 01:05:50,551
have just begun.
- What?

892
01:05:50,791 --> 01:05:55,871
I will get film offers. Ma'am
will sign them and you'll enjoy.

893
01:05:55,991 --> 01:05:59,911
Sign! - Mr Khanna wants ma'am
to sign a three-film contract.

894
01:06:00,231 --> 01:06:02,391
Three! You had said one film.

895
01:06:02,511 --> 01:06:04,021
I won't accept
the three-film offer.

896
01:06:04,111 --> 01:06:05,791
Sorry, sir.
I feel very sorry for you.

897
01:06:06,031 --> 01:06:08,191
Who are you to refuse?
Are you her husband?

898
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:10,111
Mr Khanna has spoken to Ms Singh.

899
01:06:11,031 --> 01:06:13,111
Take the contract and get it back
tomorrow after she has signed it.

900
01:06:13,769 --> 01:06:14,581
Go!

901
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:15,991
Contract!
- Go!

902
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:17,471
Stupid man!

903
01:06:17,591 --> 01:06:18,991
She agreed to a contract!

904
01:06:26,831 --> 01:06:27,791
Taxi!

905
01:06:28,231 --> 01:06:29,031
2 minutes.

906
01:06:31,871 --> 01:06:33,551
Come on.
- But...

907
01:06:33,871 --> 01:06:34,871
Fast.

908
01:06:35,631 --> 01:06:36,483
Go.

909
01:06:37,631 --> 01:06:38,515
Hey!

910
01:06:51,511 --> 01:06:52,348
Hey!

911
01:06:55,264 --> 01:06:56,351
Hello, Miss Ruby Singh.

912
01:06:56,711 --> 01:06:57,631
How dare...

913
01:06:57,791 --> 01:07:00,751
The manager said you agreed
to a three-film contract.

914
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:03,431
Don't sign this contract...

915
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:13,850
The key...

916
01:07:25,911 --> 01:07:27,111
What contract?

917
01:07:27,751 --> 01:07:28,711
Nothing.

918
01:07:29,511 --> 01:07:31,751
My manager asked me

919
01:07:32,111 --> 01:07:33,711
to sign a two-year contract.

920
01:07:34,071 --> 01:07:35,071
I don't know if I should.

921
01:07:39,991 --> 01:07:41,351
Where did we go?

922
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:45,111
To the park, the beach...

923
01:07:47,511 --> 01:07:48,311
We did?

924
01:07:49,111 --> 01:07:50,431
I don't remember anything.

925
01:07:52,431 --> 01:07:53,951
Where we went, what we did...

926
01:07:54,231 --> 01:07:55,631
How can I not remember anything?

927
01:07:55,751 --> 01:07:56,791
I told you...

928
01:07:57,671 --> 01:07:58,791
I don't understand.

929
01:07:58,911 --> 01:08:00,311
I want ghosts.
- What?

930
01:08:00,431 --> 01:08:01,751
I want food.

931
01:08:03,271 --> 01:08:04,471
Didn't you eat anything?

932
01:08:04,591 --> 01:08:06,311
No. Please cook some food.

933
01:08:06,471 --> 01:08:08,031
Give me 10 minutes.
I'll cook something.

934
01:08:33,351 --> 01:08:34,471
Sign it.

935
01:08:34,711 --> 01:08:35,511
What is it?

936
01:08:36,351 --> 01:08:37,311
Contract.

937
01:08:37,631 --> 01:08:39,151
'I, Ruby the ghost,'

938
01:08:39,271 --> 01:08:42,351
'will not possess Devi's body
after this film.'

939
01:08:42,471 --> 01:08:43,471
What the hell!

940
01:08:43,591 --> 01:08:47,271
'I won't possess Devi's body ever
again, whatever the circumstances.'

941
01:08:48,111 --> 01:08:49,391
What kind of a contract is this!

942
01:08:51,951 --> 01:08:53,031
My contract.

943
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:56,111
Point number three.

944
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:59,391
'I, Ruby the ghost, accept that'

945
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:03,591
'I won't do any intimate scenes
with Raj Khanna'

946
01:09:03,951 --> 01:09:06,048
'or rape scenes with the villain.'

947
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:07,511
Strictly no.

948
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,951
Point number 4...

949
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:10,991
No smoking. No drinking.

950
01:09:11,631 --> 01:09:12,831
Point number 5...

951
01:09:13,831 --> 01:09:16,471
'I won't use any super powers.'

952
01:09:17,031 --> 01:09:17,951
And...

953
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:19,391
What?
- Especially,

954
01:09:19,631 --> 01:09:21,671
on the gentleman Krishna.

955
01:09:22,551 --> 01:09:25,751
Swear by God and sign it,
Ruby, the ghost.

956
01:09:26,631 --> 01:09:28,271
Have you gone mad?
- A little.

957
01:09:28,511 --> 01:09:30,351
An actress has to do all that.

958
01:09:32,391 --> 01:09:34,551
You are an actress,
but the body is Devi's.

959
01:09:34,831 --> 01:09:36,071
You ant a ghost to sign a contract?

960
01:09:36,161 --> 01:09:37,871
The ghost wants to act, right?

961
01:09:38,471 --> 01:09:39,711
I won't sign it.

962
01:09:40,591 --> 01:09:41,791
I won't accept.

963
01:09:42,951 --> 01:09:43,951
Hey!

964
01:09:45,231 --> 01:09:46,311
Are you not afraid anymore?

965
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:50,511
Do you and Devi
want to live peacefully or not?

966
01:09:54,631 --> 01:09:55,951
This is the last day then.

967
01:09:56,187 --> 01:09:57,951
Devi won't leave the house
from tomorrow.

968
01:09:58,551 --> 01:10:02,311
You said you wouldn't possess
Devi in the house.

969
01:10:03,031 --> 01:10:04,701
If you want Devi
to leave the house,

970
01:10:04,791 --> 01:10:06,111
you have to sign the contract.

971
01:10:10,591 --> 01:10:11,711
Sign it.

972
01:10:12,951 --> 01:10:14,071
I am.

973
01:10:18,831 --> 01:10:19,991
Lazy ghost.

974
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:37,071
There's a problem.

975
01:10:38,471 --> 01:10:41,031
Ruby refuses to sign
the three-film contract.

976
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:42,991
Good.

977
01:10:43,081 --> 01:10:43,911
Yes, sir.

978
01:10:44,111 --> 01:10:46,511
Even I thought that face...
And three films...

979
01:10:47,168 --> 01:10:48,671
I thought you were...

980
01:10:49,551 --> 01:10:51,431
Tell the director
to wrap up the film quickly.

981
01:10:51,551 --> 01:10:54,391
Yes, sir. We'll send her packing.

982
01:10:54,671 --> 01:10:57,191
Ruby won't act in films
after marriage.

983
01:10:57,631 --> 01:10:58,671
What?

984
01:11:00,591 --> 01:11:02,511
Super decision.

985
01:11:03,511 --> 01:11:05,071
Super pairing, sir.

986
01:11:05,191 --> 01:11:06,551
Both of you
will look great together.

987
01:11:06,951 --> 01:11:08,631
Congratulations, sir.
I'm so happy.

988
01:11:09,471 --> 01:11:10,431
Rockstar.

989
01:11:22,431 --> 01:11:23,311
Ready.

990
01:11:23,511 --> 01:11:25,751
1 2 3 4

991
01:11:29,031 --> 01:11:30,311
Wow!
- Hey!

992
01:11:30,401 --> 01:11:31,231
Excuse me.

993
01:11:31,751 --> 01:11:33,191
Hello, Baby Rajinikanth.

994
01:11:34,431 --> 01:11:35,871
Who are you?
- Heroine's manager.

995
01:11:37,831 --> 01:11:40,511
You're the manager,
not the heroine, right?

996
01:11:40,631 --> 01:11:41,871
What are you doing here?

997
01:11:41,991 --> 01:11:43,233
You know what this is.

998
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:44,911
Dance is a form of worship.

999
01:11:45,671 --> 01:11:47,391
Dancing is an art.

1000
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:50,965
Do you know the ABCD of dance?

1001
01:11:51,711 --> 01:11:54,791
Do you know how to dance?
Get out of here.

1002
01:11:58,631 --> 01:11:59,791
"It's bad."

1003
01:12:00,271 --> 01:12:01,751
"It's dangerous."

1004
01:12:01,959 --> 01:12:03,311
Michael Jackson's ghost!

1005
01:12:03,751 --> 01:12:05,071
Here's another ghost.

1006
01:12:05,791 --> 01:12:08,271
This is an indoor shoot.
Close the umbrella.

1007
01:12:08,361 --> 01:12:09,271
Rehearsals?

1008
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:10,431
No rehearsals.

1009
01:12:10,591 --> 01:12:11,631
Let's take.

1010
01:12:11,951 --> 01:12:12,911
Steps?

1011
01:12:13,591 --> 01:12:14,871
Hit step, Farah.

1012
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:16,861
This one again?

1013
01:12:16,951 --> 01:12:18,461
Evergreen, Farah, evergreen.

1014
01:12:18,551 --> 01:12:20,031
He knows just this step.

1015
01:12:20,311 --> 01:12:21,941
Energy, guys, energy.
- Mind-blowing.

1016
01:12:22,031 --> 01:12:23,551
Ready? Taking!

1017
01:12:27,991 --> 01:12:29,111
Are there children in the film?

1018
01:12:29,671 --> 01:12:30,671
No.

1019
01:12:31,551 --> 01:12:33,191
Why are there
children's clothes here?

1020
01:12:33,951 --> 01:12:36,101
These are the heroine's clothes.
- Heroine... Look...

1021
01:12:36,191 --> 01:12:38,391
Are you kidding me?
What is all this?

1022
01:12:38,511 --> 01:12:40,591
She should be covered
from top to bottom.

1023
01:12:40,791 --> 01:12:41,831
Be careful, I say.

1024
01:12:42,231 --> 01:12:43,031
Yes.

1025
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:46,951
There is no top or bottom.

1026
01:12:51,311 --> 01:12:53,151
Ma'am asked you
to stay out of here.

1027
01:12:53,271 --> 01:12:54,351
Go.

1028
01:12:54,671 --> 01:12:55,471
Darn it!

1029
01:12:57,511 --> 01:12:59,111
Rehearsals!

1030
01:12:59,911 --> 01:13:01,111
Look, look.

1031
01:13:01,201 --> 01:13:02,311
Don't look.

1032
01:13:02,471 --> 01:13:03,271
Why?

1033
01:13:04,071 --> 01:13:05,111
How dare you object!

1034
01:13:07,511 --> 01:13:09,391
She looks se... In a modern dress.

1035
01:13:09,591 --> 01:13:11,031
She looks beautiful.

1036
01:13:11,231 --> 01:13:12,831
She is a beauty queen.

1037
01:13:14,071 --> 01:13:16,231
Lucky is the man who will
marry her, but it's pointless.

1038
01:13:16,551 --> 01:13:18,031
He won't allow her
to dress like this.

1039
01:13:19,031 --> 01:13:21,391
Beauty should be appreciated.

1040
01:13:21,591 --> 01:13:22,991
"One by one."

1041
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:24,071
He won't understand.

1042
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:30,231
Action!

1043
01:13:34,311 --> 01:13:35,431
"Tutak tutak."

1044
01:13:37,951 --> 01:13:38,991
"Tutak tutak."

1045
01:13:41,603 --> 01:13:42,911
"Tutak tutak."

1046
01:13:45,231 --> 01:13:46,071
"Tutak tutak."

1047
01:13:46,161 --> 01:13:49,511
"The dancing won't stop,
it will continue from 9 to 4."

1048
01:13:49,601 --> 01:13:53,231
"Increase the volume,
let's rock the floor."

1049
01:13:53,487 --> 01:13:56,861
"The dancing won't stop,
it will continue from 9 to 4."

1050
01:13:56,951 --> 01:14:00,671
"Increase the volume,
let's rock the floor."

1051
01:14:01,951 --> 01:14:05,471
"Tutak tutak tutiya, let's dance."

1052
01:14:05,591 --> 01:14:09,111
"Let's celebrate. Let's dance."

1053
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:12,821
"Let's talk. Let's dance."

1054
01:14:12,911 --> 01:14:16,471
"Tutak tutak tutiya."

1055
01:14:16,591 --> 01:14:20,191
"Baby likes to use Instagram."

1056
01:14:20,311 --> 01:14:23,751
"Going to the gym
has made me lean."

1057
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:27,511
"Baby uses beauty cream."

1058
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:31,071
"I am a selfie queen."

1059
01:14:31,191 --> 01:14:33,991
"Tutak tutak tutiya."

1060
01:14:40,871 --> 01:14:44,551
"We go to the club every night."

1061
01:14:44,671 --> 01:14:48,021
"We catch butterflies online."

1062
01:14:48,111 --> 01:14:51,536
"We're single, ready to mingle.
Look into my eyes."

1063
01:14:51,626 --> 01:14:56,661
"Tutak tutak tutak tutiya"

1064
01:14:56,751 --> 01:15:00,351
"Let's celebrate. Let's dance."

1065
01:15:00,471 --> 01:15:03,991
"Let's talk. Let's dance."

1066
01:15:04,081 --> 01:15:07,591
"Tutak tutak tutiya."

1067
01:15:07,681 --> 01:15:11,551
"Your hair is black,
the hair ornament is red."

1068
01:15:11,671 --> 01:15:15,621
"Your hair is black,
the hair ornament is red."

1069
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:19,191
"You are a beauty queen."

1070
01:15:19,385 --> 01:15:22,962
"You are a beauty queen.
You should be careful."

1071
01:15:23,111 --> 01:15:26,791
"Your hair is black. It's black."

1072
01:15:28,551 --> 01:15:30,311
"Let's dance."

1073
01:15:41,111 --> 01:15:42,631
"Listen. O mister,"

1074
01:15:42,951 --> 01:15:47,511
"you find anyone better than me."

1075
01:15:47,991 --> 01:15:51,471
"Tutak tutak tutiya."

1076
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:55,191
"Let's celebrate. Let's dance."

1077
01:15:55,281 --> 01:15:58,871
"Let's talk. Let's dance."

1078
01:15:58,991 --> 01:16:02,471
"Tutak tutak tutiya."

1079
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:06,191
"Baby like to use Instagram."

1080
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:09,831
"Going to the gym
has made her lean."

1081
01:16:09,991 --> 01:16:13,511
"Baby uses beauty cream."

1082
01:16:13,631 --> 01:16:17,111
"She's called the selfie queen."

1083
01:16:17,231 --> 01:16:21,391
"Tutak tutak tutiya."

1084
01:16:22,895 --> 01:16:24,071
"Tutak."

1085
01:16:26,604 --> 01:16:27,711
"Tutak."

1086
01:16:30,237 --> 01:16:31,311
"Tutak."

1087
01:16:33,902 --> 01:16:35,471
"Tutak."
- Get out!

1088
01:16:35,831 --> 01:16:37,351
Get out of here.

1089
01:16:45,071 --> 01:16:46,111
Pack up.

1090
01:16:47,471 --> 01:16:49,191
Pack up. Out.

1091
01:16:52,271 --> 01:16:53,311
Krishna.

1092
01:16:57,591 --> 01:16:59,231
Mr Khanna wants to
meet you in his office.

1093
01:16:59,351 --> 01:17:00,831
And he expects me to go.

1094
01:17:01,631 --> 01:17:02,711
No way!

1095
01:17:07,551 --> 01:17:08,831
Hey, Krishna. Come.

1096
01:17:09,271 --> 01:17:10,071
Come here.

1097
01:17:12,391 --> 01:17:13,181
Sit.

1098
01:17:13,271 --> 01:17:14,231
Yes, sir.

1099
01:17:14,919 --> 01:17:16,551
Come here.

1100
01:17:18,911 --> 01:17:19,831
Sit.

1101
01:17:24,052 --> 01:17:26,631
I want to tell you something.

1102
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,911
What?

1103
01:17:28,551 --> 01:17:30,671
Raj Khanna, action star.

1104
01:17:31,791 --> 01:17:33,591
All that is okay, but...

1105
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:37,951
Love, girl...
- Not right, sir.

1106
01:17:39,911 --> 01:17:41,551
I am human too.
- Really?

1107
01:17:42,631 --> 01:17:43,871
Superstar.

1108
01:17:45,551 --> 01:17:47,631
I've had this problem
since I was in school.

1109
01:17:48,431 --> 01:17:51,471
Any girl I liked,
I would write a letter to her,

1110
01:17:53,187 --> 01:17:54,911
but never
mustered the courage to give it.

1111
01:17:55,431 --> 01:17:57,471
I wrote a letter to Ruby but...

1112
01:17:59,351 --> 01:18:00,511
I couldn't give it to her.

1113
01:18:00,751 --> 01:18:02,231
You'll give ma'am a letter!

1114
01:18:05,631 --> 01:18:07,191
Thank God!
- I won't.

1115
01:18:08,136 --> 01:18:09,271
You will.

1116
01:18:10,591 --> 01:18:11,508
Krishna...

1117
01:18:12,031 --> 01:18:12,947
I won't.

1118
01:18:13,551 --> 01:18:15,055
I've expressed my feelings
in this letter.

1119
01:18:19,071 --> 01:18:22,031
Give her this letter
and tell her that I love her.

1120
01:18:25,591 --> 01:18:27,584
Enough is enough, Mr Khanna.

1121
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:30,395
Take that.

1122
01:18:31,271 --> 01:18:32,831
Do you work out that much?

1123
01:18:35,951 --> 01:18:37,111
I'm counting on you.

1124
01:18:37,431 --> 01:18:38,231
Mr Khanna.

1125
01:18:42,111 --> 01:18:42,951
And...

1126
01:18:46,191 --> 01:18:48,111
Don't tell anyone.

1127
01:18:49,951 --> 01:18:50,911
Thank you.

1128
01:19:06,671 --> 01:19:07,471
Devi...

1129
01:19:07,591 --> 01:19:08,391
Devi!

1130
01:19:08,972 --> 01:19:10,071
Devi.
- Devi.

1131
01:19:12,071 --> 01:19:12,871
De...

1132
01:19:13,391 --> 01:19:14,191
Krishna...

1133
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:17,678
Dad.

1134
01:19:19,031 --> 01:19:20,191
Dad.

1135
01:19:20,991 --> 01:19:23,271
You brought them here? - Yes.
Why do you keep your phone off?

1136
01:19:24,031 --> 01:19:25,671
I called you so many times.

1137
01:19:25,911 --> 01:19:27,391
What's wrong with Devi?

1138
01:19:27,871 --> 01:19:30,751
She walked up the stairs,
without meeting us.

1139
01:19:30,871 --> 01:19:32,311
She did?
- Yes.

1140
01:19:32,831 --> 01:19:33,751
She did.
- Yes.

1141
01:19:33,871 --> 01:19:35,751
Why? We've been
married for so long. - Krishna.

1142
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:38,951
Krishna. - You didn't
come to meet us even once.

1143
01:19:39,271 --> 01:19:41,231
On the first floor. Take your time.

1144
01:19:41,751 --> 01:19:42,551
What's wrong?

1145
01:19:42,911 --> 01:19:43,831
Devi.
- Yes?

1146
01:19:44,631 --> 01:19:47,311
What? - Your parents and my dad
are downstairs.

1147
01:19:47,431 --> 01:19:49,311
You didn't greet them.
They are angry.

1148
01:19:49,431 --> 01:19:51,311
You sleep. I'll attend to them.

1149
01:19:51,791 --> 01:19:53,871
Devi. They...

1150
01:19:58,871 --> 01:20:00,471
I...
- Take this.

1151
01:20:00,631 --> 01:20:03,671
What is this?
What are you upset about?

1152
01:20:03,791 --> 01:20:06,191
Everyone makes mistakes.

1153
01:20:06,311 --> 01:20:07,871
You are... No.

1154
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:09,511
Devi, you should...

1155
01:20:09,631 --> 01:20:10,631
Hug them.
- Mom.

1156
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:13,831
Happy family! Very good.

1157
01:20:14,591 --> 01:20:16,191
I'll take that.

1158
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:19,031
Please come in. Mom.

1159
01:20:19,671 --> 01:20:20,471
Take that.

1160
01:20:20,591 --> 01:20:21,391
Let's go.

1161
01:20:21,791 --> 01:20:23,111
In the room.

1162
01:20:25,295 --> 01:20:27,311
I don't know how you did it,

1163
01:20:27,431 --> 01:20:29,871
but for the first time,
you've done something good.

1164
01:20:30,071 --> 01:20:31,951
I swear, it was a mistake.

1165
01:20:37,018 --> 01:20:39,794
Hello.
- Sir, the car is ready.

1166
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:43,719
Ma'am won't come today.

1167
01:20:43,809 --> 01:20:45,034
Why? What's wrong?

1168
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:48,494
Ma'am is not well and I am mad.

1169
01:20:52,574 --> 01:20:53,894
Go to sleep.

1170
01:21:09,934 --> 01:21:11,894
Sorry. I'll never bathe again.

1171
01:21:20,054 --> 01:21:21,094
Ruby!

1172
01:21:22,934 --> 01:21:23,974
Ruby!

1173
01:21:27,441 --> 01:21:29,414
Where are you going?
- Raj Khanna is here.

1174
01:21:29,504 --> 01:21:30,654
Raj Khanna!

1175
01:21:31,068 --> 01:21:32,364
I am a huge fan.

1176
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:34,284
Raj Khanna...

1177
01:21:34,374 --> 01:21:37,014
Come on. Raj Khanna is here.

1178
01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:40,454
Raj Khanna is here.

1179
01:21:41,534 --> 01:21:42,814
Ruby!
- Raj Khanna.

1180
01:21:43,134 --> 01:21:45,734
Raj Khanna.
- Do you know where Ruby lives?

1181
01:21:47,294 --> 01:21:48,574
Listen...

1182
01:21:48,934 --> 01:21:50,094
Excuse me.

1183
01:21:51,174 --> 01:21:52,774
Does anyone know
where the actress Ruby lives?

1184
01:21:54,254 --> 01:21:55,934
I have come here...
- Raj Khanna.

1185
01:21:56,734 --> 01:21:57,564
Ruby...

1186
01:21:57,654 --> 01:21:59,894
Devi, come here quickly.

1187
01:22:01,014 --> 01:22:03,414
Okay, but I am here...

1188
01:22:04,694 --> 01:22:07,294
Mom, it's Raj Khanna!

1189
01:22:08,694 --> 01:22:11,054
Ruby's house is here.
- Sir, what are you doing?

1190
01:22:11,614 --> 01:22:13,134
Sir, look over there.

1191
01:22:13,534 --> 01:22:14,694
Autograph please.

1192
01:22:15,614 --> 01:22:17,414
The crowd is getting rowdy.
Let's go.

1193
01:22:18,894 --> 01:22:20,614
Sir, please. Let's go.

1194
01:22:23,534 --> 01:22:25,654
Are you alright?
- Yes.

1195
01:22:27,974 --> 01:22:30,134
Please come.
- Raj Khanna.

1196
01:22:30,934 --> 01:22:32,414
Let's go, sir.

1197
01:22:33,494 --> 01:22:34,830
Let's go.

1198
01:22:36,254 --> 01:22:37,974
Bye.

1199
01:22:43,414 --> 01:22:45,414
He's calling.

1200
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:47,094
Hello?

1201
01:22:47,374 --> 01:22:49,494
Hello, how is ma'am?

1202
01:22:49,974 --> 01:22:51,014
Fine.

1203
01:22:53,494 --> 01:22:55,084
Give the phone to ma'am.
Sir wants to speak to her.

1204
01:22:55,174 --> 01:22:56,214
She's sleeping.

1205
01:22:56,734 --> 01:22:57,804
You said she was fine.

1206
01:22:57,894 --> 01:23:00,734
Can't a person who is fine
not sleep?

1207
01:23:04,863 --> 01:23:06,174
Let her sleep.

1208
01:23:07,294 --> 01:23:09,134
She has to shoot
a scene with sir tomorrow.

1209
01:23:09,294 --> 01:23:12,174
Let her rest.
The car will be there at 9.

1210
01:23:12,534 --> 01:23:14,044
Why have you lost weight?
- No.

1211
01:23:14,134 --> 01:23:16,164
I don't go to the gym
and no home food.

1212
01:23:16,254 --> 01:23:17,644
You should come here.

1213
01:23:17,734 --> 01:23:20,534
I can cook for an extra person.

1214
01:23:23,254 --> 01:23:24,734
Devi. Devi.

1215
01:23:25,058 --> 01:23:26,454
I...
- Listen...

1216
01:23:26,854 --> 01:23:29,894
She's a gem of a person.

1217
01:23:30,454 --> 01:23:31,974
And you don't like her!

1218
01:23:33,934 --> 01:23:35,094
Devi, come here.

1219
01:23:36,054 --> 01:23:36,974
Where?

1220
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:44,934
Ruby.

1221
01:23:45,294 --> 01:23:46,254
What?

1222
01:23:48,474 --> 01:23:50,014
They want you to shoot tomorrow.

1223
01:23:50,254 --> 01:23:52,174
Our family is here for a week.

1224
01:23:52,454 --> 01:23:54,134
How can I take Devi out...

1225
01:23:54,951 --> 01:23:56,054
Listen...

1226
01:23:56,438 --> 01:23:57,654
You know how it is.

1227
01:23:58,294 --> 01:23:59,534
That is your problem.

1228
01:24:04,254 --> 01:24:06,014
Tomorrow's shoot
is cancelled. Okay?

1229
01:24:07,092 --> 01:24:08,494
That is your problem too.

1230
01:24:09,214 --> 01:24:10,454
They will come here

1231
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:12,014
and you will have to
deal with that.

1232
01:24:14,694 --> 01:24:16,894
What do I do? You are a ghost.

1233
01:24:17,294 --> 01:24:19,214
Do something to make them go away.

1234
01:24:21,214 --> 01:24:22,974
But that was not a clause
in the contract.

1235
01:24:28,014 --> 01:24:29,574
Good, you're dead.

1236
01:24:29,974 --> 01:24:32,134
Else I would've killed you.

1237
01:24:36,214 --> 01:24:37,294
Hey!

1238
01:24:39,814 --> 01:24:40,894
Friends.

1239
01:24:41,774 --> 01:24:43,134
Please do something.

1240
01:24:46,974 --> 01:24:49,094
Hey, what did you do?

1241
01:24:59,414 --> 01:25:00,494
Who are you?

1242
01:25:00,923 --> 01:25:01,974
What are you looking at?

1243
01:25:02,854 --> 01:25:03,854
Scoot!

1244
01:25:11,574 --> 01:25:12,866
What's wrong?
- See for yourself.

1245
01:25:17,454 --> 01:25:19,894
I don't get to spend time with you.

1246
01:25:21,614 --> 01:25:24,374
What are you doing? It tickles.

1247
01:25:26,534 --> 01:25:30,054
They came here, met us,
they should leave now.

1248
01:25:31,934 --> 01:25:33,574
We are newly-weds.

1249
01:25:33,945 --> 01:25:35,414
We need privacy.

1250
01:25:44,573 --> 01:25:46,414
Devi...

1251
01:25:48,014 --> 01:25:50,437
Listen, let's do something.

1252
01:25:51,094 --> 01:25:54,734
Till they are here,
we'll go somewhere else.

1253
01:26:02,734 --> 01:26:05,214
Be ready at 9. We'll go.

1254
01:26:08,644 --> 01:26:09,654
In fact...

1255
01:26:10,654 --> 01:26:11,774
We should leave now.

1256
01:26:13,774 --> 01:26:14,814
Wait.

1257
01:26:23,854 --> 01:26:25,494
Ask them what they'll eat.

1258
01:26:27,334 --> 01:26:28,374
Okay.

1259
01:26:30,135 --> 01:26:31,134
Listen...

1260
01:26:31,454 --> 01:26:32,534
Who?

1261
01:26:34,348 --> 01:26:35,574
What would you like to have?

1262
01:26:38,350 --> 01:26:39,374
Tell me.

1263
01:26:50,014 --> 01:26:52,115
Who is it at this hour?

1264
01:27:03,214 --> 01:27:05,110
That man...

1265
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:21,254
Yes.

1266
01:27:23,254 --> 01:27:25,214
You should've stayed longer.

1267
01:27:25,374 --> 01:27:26,444
Really?

1268
01:27:26,534 --> 01:27:28,294
But...
- Wait.

1269
01:27:28,494 --> 01:27:30,044
What's the hurry?
- Listen...

1270
01:27:30,134 --> 01:27:32,734
Taxi cancelled.
- You can leave in some time.

1271
01:27:33,136 --> 01:27:34,454
Give this to him.

Let's go.

1274
01:27:38,472 --> 01:27:39,814
Let's go.

1275
01:27:42,054 --> 01:27:43,204
You won't come downstairs.

1276
01:27:43,294 --> 01:27:44,854
She'll wave bye from the kitchen.

1277
01:27:45,573 --> 01:27:46,414
Okay.

1278
01:27:46,563 --> 01:27:47,694
Go to the kitchen.

01:28:01,174 --> 01:28:02,254
Raj!

1282
01:28:26,730 --> 01:28:28,294
Ouch!
- Hey, Ruby!

1283
01:28:31,534 --> 01:28:32,694
Oh no.

1284
01:28:35,664 --> 01:28:37,534
Ouch!
- Are you okay?

1285
01:28:37,774 --> 01:28:38,894
It's paining.

1286
01:28:38,984 --> 01:28:40,294
She's injured.

1287
01:28:40,621 --> 01:28:42,774
She's just pretending.

1288
01:28:43,014 --> 01:28:44,374
Over reacting.

1289
01:28:45,534 --> 01:28:46,494
One more.

1290
01:28:50,214 --> 01:28:51,974
Another retake?
- It's okay.

1291
01:28:54,534 --> 01:28:56,134
Roll camera.
- Rolling.

1292
01:28:57,254 --> 01:28:58,054
Action!

1293
01:29:04,106 --> 01:29:06,134
Sir, he's hitting him for real.
- Quiet.

1294
01:29:06,294 --> 01:29:07,374
Looks real.

1295
01:29:09,414 --> 01:29:10,854
He's hitting him badly.
- Realistic.

1296
01:29:17,094 --> 01:29:19,206
Steady cam, follow me. Come.

1297
01:29:21,454 --> 01:29:22,774
No, sir...

1298
01:29:53,214 --> 01:29:55,414
If even one tear
falls from her eyes...

1299
01:29:57,042 --> 01:29:58,214
What an angle!

1300
01:30:10,734 --> 01:30:12,214
Revolver Raja 3.

1301
01:30:13,014 --> 01:30:15,014
It's not an action film.

1302
01:30:15,449 --> 01:30:17,054
It's a romantic film.

1303
01:30:35,654 --> 01:30:36,694
What?

1304
01:30:37,189 --> 01:30:38,294
You're hurt.

1305
01:30:38,989 --> 01:30:40,534
I'm hurt?

1306
01:30:41,254 --> 01:30:42,804
Where?
- I'm searching.

1307
01:30:42,894 --> 01:30:44,934
I'd get injured often.

1308
01:30:45,094 --> 01:30:46,054
Move.

1309
01:31:20,414 --> 01:31:23,174
"The colours of love..."

1310
01:31:23,294 --> 01:31:24,534
"Love..."

1311
01:31:25,414 --> 01:31:28,134
"Love is everywhere."

1312
01:31:30,372 --> 01:31:35,174
"All the beautiful moments..."

1313
01:31:35,465 --> 01:31:38,574
"Are all around us."

1314
01:31:39,038 --> 01:31:44,094
"I love you, be mine."

1315
01:31:44,184 --> 01:31:49,174
"Let us lose ourselves in love."

1316
01:31:49,264 --> 01:31:54,204
"I love you, be mine."

1317
01:31:54,294 --> 01:31:59,494
"Let us lose ourselves in love."

1318
01:31:59,819 --> 01:32:04,574
"Our journey of love has begun."

1319
01:32:04,888 --> 01:32:09,404
"Let us go on this
journey together."

1320
01:32:09,494 --> 01:32:14,734
"Our journey of love has begun."

1321
01:32:14,934 --> 01:32:19,734
"Let us go on this
journey together."

1322
01:32:20,454 --> 01:32:23,214
"The colours of love..."

1323
01:32:25,614 --> 01:32:28,854
"Love is everywhere."

1324
01:32:52,774 --> 01:32:55,204
"You're the one I want."

1325
01:32:55,294 --> 01:32:57,764
"I have you now."

1326
01:32:57,854 --> 01:33:01,454
"Life is more beautiful now."

1327
01:33:02,814 --> 01:33:05,254
"You dwell in my heart."

1328
01:33:05,374 --> 01:33:07,694
"I love you."

1329
01:33:07,814 --> 01:33:11,774
"I can give my life for you."

1330
01:33:11,974 --> 01:33:16,884
"I love you. Be mine."

1331
01:33:16,974 --> 01:33:22,444
"Let us lose ourselves in love."

1332
01:33:22,534 --> 01:33:27,212
"Our journey of love has begun."

1333
01:33:27,574 --> 01:33:32,552
"Let us go
on this journey together."

1334
01:33:33,125 --> 01:33:35,894
"The colours of love..."

1335
01:33:38,205 --> 01:33:41,695
"Love is everywhere."

1336
01:33:45,025 --> 01:33:46,294
Are you Ruby's manager?

1337
01:33:46,578 --> 01:33:47,654
We want dates.

1338
01:33:47,854 --> 01:33:49,134
A five-film contract.

1339
01:33:50,237 --> 01:33:51,654
You may come here to meet me,

1340
01:33:52,285 --> 01:33:53,764
but don't discuss Ruby's dates.

1341
01:33:53,854 --> 01:33:55,774
I gave the rights for this film.

1342
01:33:55,864 --> 01:33:57,054
Go away!

1343
01:33:59,513 --> 01:34:00,894
Did you give Ruby the letter?

1344
01:34:01,108 --> 01:34:02,644
No.
- Why?

1345
01:34:02,734 --> 01:34:05,564
Ma'am's dream, this film...
Full concentration.

1346
01:34:05,654 --> 01:34:07,644
If I give her the letter,
she will be disturbed. - Then?

1347
01:34:07,734 --> 01:34:09,494
Finish the film soon.

1348
01:34:10,094 --> 01:34:11,774
I will give her the letter then.

1349
01:34:13,174 --> 01:34:16,124
Raj...
Sir, good behaviour till then.

1350
01:34:16,214 --> 01:34:18,164
Good behaviour!
- Even if the director says...

1351
01:34:18,254 --> 01:34:20,534
Don't touch. Keep a safe distance.

1352
01:34:21,494 --> 01:34:23,654
The more you stay away
from the heroine,

1353
01:34:24,029 --> 01:34:26,174
the closer the heroine will get.

1354
01:34:26,614 --> 01:34:27,894
Women's psychology.

1355
01:34:28,294 --> 01:34:29,534
Old formula...

1356
01:34:29,774 --> 01:34:31,174
But works every time.

1357
01:34:36,934 --> 01:34:38,294
Am I making sense?

1358
01:34:40,374 --> 01:34:41,614
A lot of sense.

1359
01:34:45,465 --> 01:34:50,294
"Everywhere I look, I see you."

1360
01:34:50,699 --> 01:34:55,254
"You are all I ask for."

1361
01:34:55,525 --> 01:35:00,254
"I want to get close to you."

1362
01:35:00,446 --> 01:35:03,894
"Take me into your arms."

1363
01:35:04,590 --> 01:35:09,457
"I love you. Be mine."

1364
01:35:09,547 --> 01:35:15,014
"Let's lose ourselves in love."

1365
01:35:15,814 --> 01:35:18,494
"The colours of love..."

1366
01:35:20,925 --> 01:35:24,214
"Love is everywhere."

1367
01:35:31,174 --> 01:35:32,214
I will.

1368
01:35:34,214 --> 01:35:35,229
We will be back.

1369
01:35:35,319 --> 01:35:36,374
Cut it!

1370
01:35:37,486 --> 01:35:39,814
It's a wrap for Revolver Raja.

1371
01:35:44,654 --> 01:35:45,894
The next...

1372
01:35:50,054 --> 01:35:50,987
Yes!

1373
01:35:52,171 --> 01:35:53,014
I'll see you.

1374
01:35:57,414 --> 01:35:58,774
Yes.

1375
01:35:59,593 --> 01:36:01,614
You look happy.

1376
01:36:01,946 --> 01:36:03,924
The film is done. You'll go.

1377
01:36:04,014 --> 01:36:05,014
Happy journey.

1378
01:36:06,174 --> 01:36:07,614
The shoot is done.

1379
01:36:07,942 --> 01:36:09,294
The film hasn't released.

1380
01:36:11,814 --> 01:36:14,334
I have the contract.
You are under control.

1381
01:36:14,774 --> 01:36:15,734
Let me see it.

1382
01:36:17,134 --> 01:36:20,014
Does it say I'll leave
after the shoot is over?

1383
01:36:21,894 --> 01:36:24,374
My dream is to see
myself on the screen.

1384
01:36:25,094 --> 01:36:26,604
How can I go?

1385
01:36:26,694 --> 01:36:28,174
Grow up, man.

1386
01:36:31,854 --> 01:36:33,294
This is not good.

1387
01:36:33,574 --> 01:36:34,507
Sir...

1388
01:36:35,814 --> 01:36:36,614
Yes, Krishna?

1389
01:36:36,774 --> 01:36:38,004
When will the film be released?

1390
01:36:38,094 --> 01:36:38,894
In two months.

1391
01:36:39,014 --> 01:36:40,044
Two months!

1392
01:36:40,134 --> 01:36:41,838
Why? The shoot is over.

1393
01:36:41,928 --> 01:36:43,334
Release it tomorrow. Or...

1394
01:36:45,574 --> 01:36:46,654
Why two months?

1395
01:36:46,899 --> 01:36:49,414
The shoot is over.
Release it tomorrow.

1396
01:36:49,504 --> 01:36:51,973
Please, sir. You can do it.
- How is it possible?

1397
01:36:52,063 --> 01:36:54,044
Only you can do it.
- Not possible.

1398
01:36:54,134 --> 01:36:55,724
Nothing is impossible. Please.

1399
01:36:55,814 --> 01:36:56,964
Hey...
- Please.

1400
01:36:57,054 --> 01:36:58,694
Technical problem.
You don't get it.

1401
01:36:59,454 --> 01:37:00,374
Nonsense!

1402
01:37:00,814 --> 01:37:02,214
What technical problem?

1403
01:37:16,654 --> 01:37:18,674
Hey you! Hey!

1404
01:37:19,454 --> 01:37:20,836
What are you doing?

1405
01:37:21,974 --> 01:37:23,014
Hey!

1406
01:37:23,734 --> 01:37:25,618
Hello! Stop!

1407
01:37:27,094 --> 01:37:27,924
He's gone.

1408
01:37:28,014 --> 01:37:32,094
I tried to stop them, but they
took her away. - Where's ma'am?

1409
01:37:32,431 --> 01:37:33,454
They took ma'am.

1410
01:37:34,447 --> 01:37:35,654
Let's go.

1411
01:37:45,854 --> 01:37:47,141
Amazing story.

1412
01:37:47,694 --> 01:37:49,214
Hey!
- Hear the narration.

1413
01:37:49,304 --> 01:37:50,974
You will like it.

1414
01:38:03,574 --> 01:38:06,374
Raj, your film is over.
Now, I can sign her.

1415
01:38:18,694 --> 01:38:19,654
Listen...

1416
01:38:20,054 --> 01:38:22,027
If I see you around Ruby...

1417
01:38:34,614 --> 01:38:37,294
If a tear falls from her eye...

1418
01:38:45,629 --> 01:38:46,764
Come।

1419
01:39:07,174 --> 01:39:08,254
Follow me.

1420
01:39:22,632 --> 01:39:23,454
Devi?

1421
01:39:24,214 --> 01:39:25,294
What's wrong?

1422
01:39:30,091 --> 01:39:32,014
I don't know what's
happening to me.

1423
01:39:34,643 --> 01:39:36,534
I don't remember anything.

1424
01:39:38,454 --> 01:39:40,134
Where I go, what I do.

1425
01:39:42,543 --> 01:39:44,374
My head hurts.

1426
01:39:46,294 --> 01:39:47,294
Nothing is wrong.

1427
01:39:47,734 --> 01:39:48,734
No.

1428
01:39:49,624 --> 01:39:51,294
It must be a fatal disease.

1429
01:39:54,014 --> 01:39:55,934
I don't think I'll live long.

1430
01:39:58,734 --> 01:40:00,814
I told you, nothing is wrong.

1431
01:40:01,974 --> 01:40:03,294
If anything happens to me...

1432
01:40:05,094 --> 01:40:07,374
I want you to be happy.

1433
01:40:10,134 --> 01:40:11,734
You should remarry.

1434
01:40:14,014 --> 01:40:16,094
A girl of your choice.

1435
01:40:21,174 --> 01:40:22,294
Why did you say that?

1436
01:40:23,734 --> 01:40:24,814
Nothing will happen to you.

1437
01:40:26,414 --> 01:40:27,774
I won't let anything happen.

1438
01:40:29,414 --> 01:40:31,374
Don't think too much.
Go to sleep.

1439
01:40:51,214 --> 01:40:52,044
Hello.

1440
01:40:52,134 --> 01:40:53,294
Is the film releasing?

1441
01:40:53,573 --> 01:40:56,884
Yes, it's been difficult.
The struggle...

1442
01:40:56,974 --> 01:40:58,844
Could I get two tickets?

1443
01:40:58,934 --> 01:41:01,284
There's a special show
for people from the industry.

1444
01:41:01,374 --> 01:41:03,164
Get the tickets from the office.

1445
01:41:03,254 --> 01:41:04,734
Thank you, sir.

1446
01:41:05,894 --> 01:41:06,694
Yuck!

1447
01:41:08,044 --> 01:41:10,234
I spoke to the manager.
He said I'd get two tickets.

1448
01:41:10,324 --> 01:41:12,484
You don't need tickets
to watch the show, Krishna.

1449
01:41:12,574 --> 01:41:14,084
Did you give the letter to Ruby?

1450
01:41:14,684 --> 01:41:16,124
Yes. Yes, I did.

1451
01:41:17,044 --> 01:41:18,844
It's here. I'll give it to her
after the film is released.

1452
01:41:19,099 --> 01:41:20,614
I promise.

1453
01:41:21,084 --> 01:41:22,204
You don't need to.

1454
01:41:22,604 --> 01:41:24,084
Decision changed?
- Yes.

1455
01:41:26,033 --> 01:41:27,364
I won't tell her.

1456
01:41:31,484 --> 01:41:32,764
I'll tell the world.

1457
01:41:33,524 --> 01:41:35,204
At the press conference.

1458
01:41:36,167 --> 01:41:37,964
Raj weds Ruby.

1459
01:41:42,764 --> 01:41:43,964
And you are my best man.

1460
01:41:44,924 --> 01:41:46,004
Don't tell Ruby.

1461
01:41:46,404 --> 01:41:47,444
It's a surprise.

1462
01:41:47,924 --> 01:41:49,044
Worst man.

1463
01:41:50,364 --> 01:41:52,015
Ruby won't be there
after the film is released.

1464
01:41:53,444 --> 01:41:55,124
He'll announce
it at the press meet.

1465
01:42:18,444 --> 01:42:19,364
I will.

1466
01:42:21,564 --> 01:42:22,674
We will be back.

1467
01:42:22,764 --> 01:42:25,964
Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby!

1468
01:42:26,054 --> 01:42:28,364
Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby!

1469
01:42:28,564 --> 01:42:30,884
Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby!

1470
01:42:31,124 --> 01:42:33,804
Congratulations.

1471
01:42:35,084 --> 01:42:36,124
You're amazing.

1472
01:42:38,264 --> 01:42:39,364
Actually, I'm very lucky.

1473
01:42:41,918 --> 01:42:43,204
I have a surprise for you.

1474
01:42:44,672 --> 01:42:45,804
I'll tell you
at the press conference.

1475
01:43:02,856 --> 01:43:03,964
Who are you?

1476
01:43:04,204 --> 01:43:06,604
How you look...
I don't know.

1477
01:43:07,724 --> 01:43:09,044
I'm sure about one thing.

1478
01:43:09,727 --> 01:43:13,364
If you were alive,
you would've been very successful.

1479
01:43:17,164 --> 01:43:18,444
Great performance.

1480
01:43:18,564 --> 01:43:20,554
Here comes the new sensation.

1481
01:43:20,644 --> 01:43:24,884
The heroine of Revolver Raja 003,
Miss Ruby.

1482
01:43:28,284 --> 01:43:31,444
You shouldn't have ended your life.

1483
01:43:32,484 --> 01:43:33,684
But I am happy,

1484
01:43:34,484 --> 01:43:35,644
that through Devi,

1485
01:43:36,638 --> 01:43:38,084
you could live your dream.

1486
01:43:38,364 --> 01:43:40,764
Can we please have you on stage,
Miss Ruby?

1487
01:43:46,048 --> 01:43:47,164
Wear this sari.

1488
01:43:47,724 --> 01:43:49,732
Devi and I will go.

1489
01:43:50,324 --> 01:43:51,404
We will leave.

1490
01:43:54,429 --> 01:43:56,074
Sir.
- Just go and check where she is.

1491
01:43:56,164 --> 01:43:57,204
Yes, sir.

1492
01:43:57,564 --> 01:43:58,604
Where?

1493
01:43:59,020 --> 01:44:00,124
Home.

1494
01:44:03,244 --> 01:44:04,404
I won't go.

1495
01:44:06,924 --> 01:44:08,044
Hey!

1496
01:44:11,893 --> 01:44:14,084
Don't joke. Don't play.

1497
01:44:17,204 --> 01:44:19,044
You saw yourself on screen.

1498
01:44:19,564 --> 01:44:22,074
You'd said you'd leave.

1499
01:44:22,164 --> 01:44:23,244
Go now.

1500
01:44:23,684 --> 01:44:25,284
Wear this.

1501
01:44:25,924 --> 01:44:27,044
Please.

1502
01:44:30,604 --> 01:44:31,764
Didn't you see...

1503
01:44:33,004 --> 01:44:34,604
People were shouting my name.

1504
01:44:35,684 --> 01:44:37,084
They were praising me.

1505
01:44:37,844 --> 01:44:39,244
They applauded my performance.

1506
01:44:41,834 --> 01:44:43,444
Think before you speak.

1507
01:44:43,644 --> 01:44:44,684
What should I think?

1508
01:44:44,965 --> 01:44:47,284
About why I trusted you
or why I allowed this?

1509
01:44:48,084 --> 01:44:49,244
You've signed a contract.

1510
01:44:55,724 --> 01:44:56,844
Hey...

1511
01:44:56,934 --> 01:44:59,044
Devi and her life...

1512
01:45:00,164 --> 01:45:01,084
Devi...

1513
01:45:01,884 --> 01:45:02,924
Who is Devi?

1514
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:05,804
There's nothing between you two.

1515
01:45:06,844 --> 01:45:08,924
You want to get rid of her.

1516
01:45:09,964 --> 01:45:13,404
If I use her body,
how will it matter to you?

1517
01:45:15,004 --> 01:45:16,684
Go if you want to.

1518
01:45:17,484 --> 01:45:19,084
I won't go anywhere.

1519
01:45:19,564 --> 01:45:21,274
Ma'am, what are you doing here?

1520
01:45:21,364 --> 01:45:24,154
People are waiting for you.
Mr Khanna is on stage already.

1521
01:45:24,244 --> 01:45:25,794
Everyone is waiting.

1522
01:45:25,884 --> 01:45:27,884
The media people, photographers...
Let's go.

1523
01:45:32,484 --> 01:45:34,674
"Ruby, she's here."

1524
01:45:34,764 --> 01:45:37,034
"Put your hands together for Ruby."

1525
01:45:37,124 --> 01:45:39,564
"Ruby, she's here."

1526
01:45:47,484 --> 01:45:48,834
Welcome, everyone.

1527
01:45:48,924 --> 01:45:51,924
This is an important day
for our film.

1528
01:45:52,884 --> 01:45:55,274
This...
- Hey, stop this nonsense!

1529
01:45:55,364 --> 01:45:56,474
Stop it.

1530
01:45:56,564 --> 01:45:57,364
Ruby...

1531
01:45:57,564 --> 01:45:58,724
Stop it.

1532
01:45:59,844 --> 01:46:01,004
She is...

1533
01:46:02,804 --> 01:46:04,244
What is he saying?

1534
01:46:04,684 --> 01:46:06,044
What is he doing?

1535
01:46:06,164 --> 01:46:07,684
What is he doing?

1536
01:46:07,804 --> 01:46:08,634
His voice...

1537
01:46:08,724 --> 01:46:09,964
Just gestures...

1538
01:46:10,404 --> 01:46:11,444
No one can hear him.

1539
01:46:19,644 --> 01:46:20,634
Is he okay?

1540
01:46:20,724 --> 01:46:22,244
Is he a fan?

1541
01:46:22,364 --> 01:46:24,084
What is he doing?

1542
01:46:24,724 --> 01:46:26,444
He's saying something.

1543
01:46:36,039 --> 01:46:39,924
Sir, people are going mad
after watching our film.

1544
01:47:08,964 --> 01:47:12,380
Revolver Raja 3, superhit.
Ruby, next superstar.

1545
01:47:12,683 --> 01:47:14,564
Wow! What a manager!

1546
01:47:14,804 --> 01:47:15,964
Very good.

1547
01:47:21,604 --> 01:47:22,844
This...

1548
01:47:27,764 --> 01:47:29,044
Please...

1549
01:47:37,724 --> 01:47:38,914
Good evening, everyone.

1550
01:47:39,004 --> 01:47:40,364
We make films.

1551
01:47:41,364 --> 01:47:42,444
We act.

1552
01:47:43,284 --> 01:47:47,844
But when acting turns to reality,
we don't realise.

1553
01:47:50,604 --> 01:47:54,564
There's a thin line
between reel life and real life.

1554
01:47:55,087 --> 01:47:56,884
I've just realised that.

1555
01:47:58,724 --> 01:48:01,644
Ruby is not just my co-star,

1556
01:48:02,723 --> 01:48:03,764
but she's the best actor.

1557
01:48:05,324 --> 01:48:06,804
Not only is she a good actress,

1558
01:48:08,204 --> 01:48:09,484
but is a good human being too.

1559
01:48:13,644 --> 01:48:16,404
The best thing that happened
to Revolver Raja.

1560
01:48:18,742 --> 01:48:19,724
And of course...

1561
01:48:21,564 --> 01:48:22,604
My life.

1562
01:48:31,764 --> 01:48:33,524
On this important day,

1563
01:48:34,244 --> 01:48:35,724
Ruby and I...

1564
01:48:37,444 --> 01:48:38,794
Both of us...
- Ma'am.

1565
01:48:38,884 --> 01:48:40,124
Ruby!
- What's wrong?

1566
01:48:40,404 --> 01:48:41,558
What happened?

1567
01:48:43,004 --> 01:48:44,724
Move aside.
Please.

1568
01:48:52,804 --> 01:48:54,884
Sir, the doctor
is calling you inside.

1569
01:49:07,964 --> 01:49:08,884
She's fine.

1570
01:49:11,083 --> 01:49:12,364
Are you married?

1571
01:49:12,796 --> 01:49:13,724
Soon.

1572
01:49:13,884 --> 01:49:15,044
Congratulations.

1573
01:49:15,924 --> 01:49:16,724
Thank you.

1574
01:49:17,004 --> 01:49:17,964
She's pregnant.

1575
01:49:36,604 --> 01:49:37,781
Thanks, doctor.

1576
01:49:43,644 --> 01:49:45,404
You love ma'am...

1577
01:49:46,884 --> 01:49:49,684
But ma'am loves me.

1578
01:49:53,244 --> 01:49:54,364
Sorry.

1579
01:50:12,783 --> 01:50:15,204
If a single tear
falls from her eyes...

1580
01:50:28,924 --> 01:50:32,604
Sir. How is ma'am? Is she fine?

1581
01:50:35,044 --> 01:50:36,203
She's pregnant.

1582
01:50:38,564 --> 01:50:40,804
Super news, sir.
God...

1583
01:50:41,004 --> 01:50:42,604
You're such a rockstar, sir.

1584
01:50:43,004 --> 01:50:44,324
You're always rocking, sir.

1585
01:50:45,044 --> 01:50:46,644
You didn't tell me.

1586
01:50:46,884 --> 01:50:48,124
When did this happen?

1587
01:50:48,444 --> 01:50:50,454
When will junior Raj be born?

1588
01:50:52,164 --> 01:50:53,004
Hello.

1589
01:50:53,604 --> 01:50:55,604
I'll call you.

1590
01:50:56,324 --> 01:50:58,044
It's the jewellery shop.

1591
01:50:58,284 --> 01:51:00,406
The pendant you'd ordered for
Miss Singh is ready.

1592
01:51:00,496 --> 01:51:01,524
What should I do?

1593
01:51:07,004 --> 01:51:07,964
Send it.

1594
01:51:08,204 --> 01:51:09,004
Where?

1595
01:51:10,884 --> 01:51:13,964
Strike my name off
and write Krishna's.

1596
01:51:15,524 --> 01:51:16,524
With love.

1597
01:51:17,604 --> 01:51:19,284
Why? Sorry, if I can ask.

1598
01:51:20,084 --> 01:51:21,244
You won't understand.

1599
01:51:23,284 --> 01:51:25,084
You're a real hero.

1600
01:51:25,364 --> 01:51:27,218
Amazing! Super!

1601
01:51:54,244 --> 01:51:55,308
Ruby.

1602
01:51:56,124 --> 01:51:57,404
We wish for many things...

1603
01:51:58,884 --> 01:52:00,795
But God's will prevails.

1604
01:52:02,964 --> 01:52:04,564
Your life was ruined.

1605
01:52:06,204 --> 01:52:09,524
But you don't have the right 'to
ruin others' lives.

1606
01:52:10,735 --> 01:52:12,004
I beg you.

1607
01:52:13,204 --> 01:52:14,724
Please return Devi to me.

1608
01:52:16,524 --> 01:52:17,924
I love her a lot.

1609
01:52:26,326 --> 01:52:27,404
Please.

1610
01:52:34,204 --> 01:52:35,204
You.

1611
01:52:37,324 --> 01:52:38,644
Hospital?

1612
01:52:40,124 --> 01:52:41,279
Are you okay?

1613
01:52:42,844 --> 01:52:43,684
I...

1614
01:52:45,564 --> 01:52:46,884
Is it so bad now?

1615
01:52:51,684 --> 01:52:52,844
What am I wearing?

1616
01:52:54,478 --> 01:52:55,644
Is it a hospital gown?

1617
01:53:09,084 --> 01:53:13,644
It will be the first time
when a husband tells his wife...

1618
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:21,172
What?

1619
01:53:24,210 --> 01:53:25,444
You are pregnant.

1620
01:54:08,764 --> 01:54:09,844
Devi.

1621
01:54:10,804 --> 01:54:12,074
Devi.
- What?

1622
01:54:12,164 --> 01:54:13,084
What are you doing?

1623
01:54:13,204 --> 01:54:15,634
You brought the clothes from the
terrace, but left the towel there.

1624
01:54:15,724 --> 01:54:16,684
I did?

1625
01:54:32,884 --> 01:54:33,801
Towel.

1626
01:54:36,844 --> 01:54:37,724
What happened?

1627
01:54:38,684 --> 01:54:39,804
Yippee!

1628
01:54:47,324 --> 01:54:48,724
What happened?

1629
01:54:49,444 --> 01:54:50,644
There was a nameplate here.

1630
01:54:52,484 --> 01:54:56,724
It had fallen down,
so I threw it away.

1631
01:54:58,164 --> 01:54:59,404
Was it important?

1632
01:55:01,444 --> 01:55:03,604
It wasn't, was it?
Okay, then.

1633
01:55:23,684 --> 01:55:25,387
Raj!
- Raj Khanna.

1634
01:55:26,244 --> 01:55:29,124
Autograph.
- Raj Khanna.

1635
01:55:32,814 --> 01:55:34,045
Autograph.

1636
01:55:37,484 --> 01:55:38,444
What's your name?

1637
01:55:42,337 --> 01:55:43,364
Ruby.

1638
01:56:03,764 --> 01:56:05,786
"A gorgeous girl..."

1639
01:56:07,284 --> 01:56:09,007
"A gorgeous girl..."

1640
01:56:10,604 --> 01:56:12,596
"A gorgeous girl..."

1641
01:56:14,244 --> 01:56:16,131
"A gorgeous girl..."

1642
01:56:17,124 --> 01:56:21,374
"Wearing dark glasses..."

1643
01:56:21,644 --> 01:56:23,354
"And high heels..."

1644
01:56:23,444 --> 01:56:25,074
"And high heels..."

1645
01:56:25,164 --> 01:56:26,794
