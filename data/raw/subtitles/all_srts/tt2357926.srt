1
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,469
Hello.

2
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:18,579
Okay, sir. Okay.

3
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:33,891
Raghuveer, You're still awake.

4
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:44,435
Surprisingly,

5
00:02:44,473 --> 00:02:47,931
For the first time in seven years,
I am seeing you smile.

6
00:02:48,844 --> 00:02:50,334
You will be released tomorrow.

7
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,709
That's why you are happy, isn't it?

8
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,641
I'll be seeing my
sister after a long time.

9
00:02:57,486 --> 00:02:58,919
Can't explain how happy I am.

10
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:00,850
You really love your sister, Don't you?
- Yes!

11
00:03:01,857 --> 00:03:05,293
In all these years,
you never met your family

12
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:06,994
Neither did you speak to them,

13
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,257
You're a good man

14
00:03:09,331 --> 00:03:10,992
How you landed up here?

15
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:16,562
I have spent seven years in this jail.

16
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,831
But, my story dates back even longer.

17
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:22,370
I was just 11 years old.

18
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:25,811
I was visiting the temple with
my mother and younger sister.

19
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:30,351
He's my son Raghuveer
and my daughter Sona.

20
00:03:30,785 --> 00:03:32,878
Please make an offering
in their name, Priest.

21
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:33,943
Sure dear.

22
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:39,383
Mom, you promised to
take me to my father.

23
00:03:39,794 --> 00:03:41,318
That's where we're going, son.

24
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,056
Here's the offering.

25
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:46,834
Won't you offer the coconut, dear?

26
00:03:47,035 --> 00:03:50,061
I completely forgot, Priest.
- Do it now.

27
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:52,773
'My mother used to say'

28
00:03:52,974 --> 00:03:56,671
'... a rotten coconut brings bad luck.'

29
00:03:57,012 --> 00:03:58,502
'And, that's exactly what happened.'

30
00:03:59,314 --> 00:04:01,043
'My father had married someone else.'

31
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:04,308
'He humiliated my mother.'
- Get out of here!

32
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,386
'And broke all ties with us.'

33
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:12,925
'My mother couldn't take this betrayal.'

34
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:15,792
'She was completely shattered.'

35
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:20,763
'She kept weeping the
entire day with us in tow.'

36
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:23,367
'And, left us forever.'

37
00:04:23,438 --> 00:04:26,805
Mother. Mother.

38
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:32,004
What happened?

39
00:04:33,415 --> 00:04:34,313
Who is she?

40
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:36,347
She's my mother.

41
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:38,352
She's dead.
- Dead!

42
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:52,499
Pay your homage.

43
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:55,899
Here you go, Priest.
- Bless you.

44
00:04:57,305 --> 00:04:58,602
Stop!

45
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,776
Who put this tomb here?

46
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,904
This field belongs to them.

47
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:08,381
Why are you bothered?

48
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,781
I own this field.

49
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,785
His mother had taken a loan from me.

50
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,914
So, the council has decided,
I can seize this field.

51
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:18,482
Get rid of this tomb, now!

52
00:05:18,994 --> 00:05:20,928
I'll repay your debt.

53
00:05:20,996 --> 00:05:23,726
Don't break my mother's tomb.

54
00:05:23,798 --> 00:05:25,925
He says he will repay your debt.

55
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:27,562
Give him a chance.

56
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:31,837
At first, his father eloped.

57
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:33,270
Then his mother died.

58
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:35,842
He's still a kid. How
will he repay my debt?

59
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,902
He'll plough the field and pay you back.
- Him?

60
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,914
I'll toil day and night.

61
00:05:40,982 --> 00:05:42,882
And repay your entire debt.

62
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:45,784
Otherwise, I will repay your debt.

63
00:05:45,854 --> 00:05:49,813
Fine. Every year the
involvement should reach me on time.

64
00:05:50,825 --> 00:05:54,386
Its installment, not involvement.
- Whatever.

65
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:56,288
Let's go.

66
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:58,330
Sir!

67
00:06:12,313 --> 00:06:13,541
Don't cry, Sona.

68
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:46,744
Mother used to say, that
star is you and that's me.

69
00:06:53,822 --> 00:06:55,050
Come on.

70
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:58,325
Come on.

71
00:08:56,477 --> 00:08:57,842
Don't worry, Raghu.

72
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,971
Your sister's going to top her exams.

73
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:03,249
Break the coconut.

74
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:21,335
Wow! There's a flower inside.

75
00:09:21,502 --> 00:09:22,935
She's definitely going to excel now.

76
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:34,611
Sona.

77
00:10:09,617 --> 00:10:11,448
Sona. Your books.

78
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,419
Hey! Be careful.

79
00:10:15,924 --> 00:10:18,950
You know she'll drop
them if you interrupt her.

80
00:10:19,394 --> 00:10:22,386
Gauri, its my exam today,
I won't need them.

81
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:23,794
Take them along, Sona.

82
00:10:23,865 --> 00:10:25,492
You can score better if you copy.

83
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:27,659
You're too much.
- Is it?

84
00:10:28,303 --> 00:10:28,997
Let's go.

85
00:10:29,904 --> 00:10:31,633
You remember everything, right?
- Yes.

86
00:10:31,906 --> 00:10:33,339
Concentrate on your studies.

87
00:10:33,441 --> 00:10:34,465
And, do well in your exams.
- Yes.

88
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,976
Why don't you go with her?
- Why?

89
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:38,939
How many times will you tell her...

90
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:41,839
..."Do good, do good..."

91
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:46,080
Hey! A hottie just
boarded the earlier bogie.

92
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:50,356
Sona's always done well...

93
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,027
Where did he go?

94
00:10:54,529 --> 00:11:00,024
"You've cast a spell on me."

95
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,667
"My heart's fallen for you."

96
00:11:10,645 --> 00:11:11,771
"Baby, I love you."

97
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,039
Come on.

98
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:15,282
"Baby, I love you."

99
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,047
"Baby, I love you."

100
00:11:19,454 --> 00:11:22,048
Nice song. You sound good too.

101
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,986
But teasing girls is wrong.

102
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:25,718
What did he say?

103
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:26,657
Wrong!

104
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,386
Who are you to interfere?

105
00:11:29,464 --> 00:11:30,328
Move!

106
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,697
See that!

107
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:34,496
I'll stab you with this.

108
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:37,800
What the...

109
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,797
Check... and mate.

110
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,076
Someday I'll definitely beat you.

111
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:53,471
I'm also waiting for that day.

112
00:12:53,548 --> 00:12:54,606
Hello Uncle.

113
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:59,947
I heard your sister's taking her college exams.
- Yes.

114
00:13:01,622 --> 00:13:04,523
She's pretty intelligent and smart girl.
- Yes.

115
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:12,023
Sona.

116
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,393
Not again, brother.

117
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,965
Sona, you see those stars in the sky...

118
00:13:20,274 --> 00:13:21,969
That one's me and the other one's you.

119
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,004
Mother used to say that, correct?

120
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:27,509
That means, after Sona's marriage...

121
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:30,273
...one of the star will disappear.

122
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:31,442
Mind your own business.

123
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,645
And...

124
00:13:33,488 --> 00:13:35,956
Brother, shall I take the
eggs to the market tomorrow?

125
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:36,853
Yes.

126
00:13:36,924 --> 00:13:38,653
But be careful.

127
00:13:40,495 --> 00:13:42,429
I didn't say that to her.

128
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:45,622
You keep dropping stuff.

129
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:47,958
I dropped it only twice today.

130
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:52,303
Hello!
- Priest, what brings you here at this hour?

131
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:57,970
After a long search,
I've found a suitable match for Sona.

132
00:13:58,446 --> 00:14:03,349
He works on a big post
in a big American company.

133
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:09,854
Then, he'll definitely
take his bride along.

134
00:14:09,924 --> 00:14:12,893
Of course, in a big airplane...

135
00:14:14,662 --> 00:14:16,823
This offer's too big for us.

136
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,257
I don't accept it.

137
00:14:20,535 --> 00:14:24,904
Huh! Anyone else would've
pounced on this opportunity.

138
00:14:27,808 --> 00:14:31,574
I don't want a prince for my sister.

139
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:32,711
Then?

140
00:14:33,014 --> 00:14:37,041
I want a boy that can stay
here and look after her.

141
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:33,305
Hey, Ram! Where are you?
- On the beach.

142
00:15:33,374 --> 00:15:34,932
On the beach, with the girls?

143
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:36,501
All by yourself.

144
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:37,839
You didn't invite me.

145
00:15:37,912 --> 00:15:40,005
You've become selfish.
- Hello.

146
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,009
Hello.
- Hello.

147
00:15:42,683 --> 00:15:44,776
That's my trick.

148
00:15:44,852 --> 00:15:47,753
This is what I do
when your mom scolds me.

149
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,949
Hello. I can't hear you.
- Okay.

150
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:52,754
Enjoy yourself. Have fun.
- Thanks, dad.

151
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:56,655
Wow! He heard this though.

152
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,865
I heard you made a donation...

153
00:16:01,936 --> 00:16:03,267
...to the Royal Australian Orphanage.

154
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,634
It's a petty amount.

155
00:16:04,805 --> 00:16:05,897
10,000 Dollars.

156
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:08,965
You call that a petty amount.

157
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:12,508
You could've spent that
money for PR activities.

158
00:16:12,613 --> 00:16:15,013
Could've thrown a party
for your business colleagues.

159
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:16,944
Think about the profits.

160
00:16:17,285 --> 00:16:19,378
We anyways throw parties.

161
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,755
Stop wasting money on useless things.

162
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:27,022
You know I don't like it.

163
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:34,698
Hi, dad.

164
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:36,903
Bad mood.

165
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:38,702
Tell me.

166
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,407
I'm your best friend.

167
00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:44,904
Mom yelled at you again?

168
00:16:45,513 --> 00:16:47,447
Thank you very much.
- Why?

169
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,914
For not asking whether
she beat me up or not.

170
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:53,449
You know how she is,

171
00:16:53,921 --> 00:16:56,947
then, why the long face?
- I'm not upset.

172
00:16:57,992 --> 00:17:00,790
Do you know why the world's
greatest philosopher was happy?

173
00:17:00,828 --> 00:17:03,388
Because he knew how to
tolerate his tormenting wife.

174
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:06,832
Angry bird!

175
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:11,632
Hello.

176
00:17:11,706 --> 00:17:12,536
It wasn't for you.

177
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,336
I was talking about Socrates' wife.

178
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,466
Hello, brother-in-law.

179
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:16,635
Krishnakant speaking.

180
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:21,842
How are you?
- Trying to get along with your sister.

181
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,907
Whats new in that.

182
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:26,577
It's your brother from India.

183
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:27,678
Hello.
- Sister.

184
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,915
Yes, brother.
- How are you?

185
00:17:28,989 --> 00:17:31,787
How are you?
- Everything is good.

186
00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:33,391
So what's new?

187
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:34,985
Too many things, but
the biggest news is...

188
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:39,790
...Ria's getting engaged
on the 14th of this month.

189
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:41,368
So soon!

190
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,761
Was she in love?
- Exactly.

191
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:48,636
I objected but she cried,
so I had to agree.

192
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:50,769
But is the boy from a good family?

193
00:17:52,046 --> 00:17:54,037
I mean, are they rich?

194
00:17:54,315 --> 00:17:56,715
That's exactly why I agreed.

195
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,751
Listen.

196
00:17:57,818 --> 00:17:59,410
Reach here as soon as you can.

197
00:17:59,487 --> 00:18:01,478
Because you only have to
look after the arrangements.

198
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:02,351
And...

199
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,652
Don't forget to tell brother-in-law.

200
00:18:03,724 --> 00:18:06,557
And...
- Hello, aunt. - Yes, dear

201
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,960
Ria speaking.
- Congratulations. How are you?

202
00:18:10,264 --> 00:18:13,563
Fine, aunt, Bring Ram along too.

203
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,568
We haven't met since our childhood.

204
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,297
Sure, dear. Bye.

205
00:18:17,838 --> 00:18:19,999
Ram.
- Yes, mom.

206
00:18:20,274 --> 00:18:21,605
Ram. We're going to India.

207
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:22,733
India!

208
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:25,902
India!
- You aren't going.

209
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,441
Why?
- You've to attend a conference in US.

210
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:30,746
Don't you remember?
- Oh yeah.

211
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,010
America, Yo!

212
00:18:34,622 --> 00:18:35,884
Stop!

213
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,618
Brother.

214
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:42,491
Ria, how are you?

215
00:18:42,563 --> 00:18:44,360
Chocolate for you, brother.

216
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,328
You never forget to get
the chocolate, do you?

217
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:50,495
Welcome the bride.
- Bride?

218
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,603
When are you getting married?

219
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,840
Next Friday. That's just 15 days.
- Right.

220
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:58,708
And, you are both invited.

221
00:18:58,779 --> 00:18:59,575
Of course.

222
00:18:59,647 --> 00:19:01,012
We'll reach there two days in advance.

223
00:19:01,282 --> 00:19:03,443
Just two days?

224
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,676
I have come here to take Sona right now.

225
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,312
Now?
- Of course.

226
00:19:08,389 --> 00:19:10,380
Sona, when would you
expect me to come over...

227
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,584
...for your marriage?

228
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,594
I don't know, ask brother.

229
00:19:15,796 --> 00:19:16,728
Brother!

230
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,497
How many days before,
you expect me to come for Sona's marriage?

231
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,300
At least 15 days.
- Right.

232
00:19:25,406 --> 00:19:27,874
My marriage is just 15 days later.

233
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:29,739
I'm just like your sister.

234
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,710
Please send her along.

235
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:33,007
Please, brother.

236
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,805
Please.

237
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:39,281
Actually, I have never
sent her alone anywhere.

238
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,283
She has also never
stayed apart from you.

239
00:19:41,355 --> 00:19:43,687
But you will have to send her along.

240
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,017
Please, brother.

241
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:47,760
Please. Please. Please.

242
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,263
You want to go, Sona?

243
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:54,700
I won't, if you say no.

244
00:19:56,837 --> 00:19:58,031
Go on.

245
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,338
Be careful!

246
00:21:28,395 --> 00:21:30,386
Hey my coconut, give me my money.

247
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,791
Hey! Hi, I'm Ram.

248
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:35,800
What's up, beautiful?

249
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:36,767
May I know your name please?

250
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,634
Paro.
- Hi.

251
00:21:38,706 --> 00:21:40,469
Dad. Mom!

252
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:35,787
Ram!

253
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,318
Look what a big bouquet
I brought for you.

254
00:23:38,358 --> 00:23:39,757
I... I am Bijli.

255
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:48,428
Bijli!

256
00:23:51,872 --> 00:23:52,804
Nephew.

257
00:23:52,873 --> 00:23:53,601
Nephew.

258
00:23:53,674 --> 00:23:55,733
Uncle.
- My dear!

259
00:23:56,844 --> 00:23:57,902
Put your leg down.

260
00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:01,313
That's enough.

261
00:24:02,616 --> 00:24:03,947
He's naughty!

262
00:24:08,288 --> 00:24:09,255
What is he doing?

263
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:12,917
Who is this beauty and the beast?

264
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,756
She's my distant relative.

265
00:24:15,629 --> 00:24:16,027
Her too.

266
00:24:16,296 --> 00:24:16,955
And I'm a close one.

267
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:19,957
You...

268
00:24:27,374 --> 00:24:28,466
Why aren't you saying anything?

269
00:24:28,976 --> 00:24:32,639
Tell me, even a vegetable vendor
in Australia speak English?

270
00:24:33,547 --> 00:24:35,378
It's okay. Don't say a word.

271
00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:41,847
The policeman, maid, fruit-seller,
cleaner, everyone speaks English?

272
00:24:41,922 --> 00:24:45,449
What's your problem?
- I've a bad stomach.

273
00:24:45,592 --> 00:24:48,390
So, why are you telling me?
- You just asked, what's my problem.

274
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:00,533
Bijli.

275
00:25:01,308 --> 00:25:02,297
Who's that?
- Ria?

276
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,331
Ria!

277
00:25:31,338 --> 00:25:33,533
I'm not Ria.
- Why?

278
00:25:34,441 --> 00:25:37,433
I'm Ria's friend.
- Why didn't you say that earlier?

279
00:25:38,512 --> 00:25:39,308
It's okay.

280
00:25:39,379 --> 00:25:40,676
Mistakes are common at this age.

281
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,305
No need to apologize.

282
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:43,777
Oh! Anklet.

283
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:45,649
Ram.

284
00:25:48,722 --> 00:25:50,815
Ria!

285
00:25:51,391 --> 00:25:52,585
How are you?
- Fine.

286
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:53,751
Please.

287
00:25:54,061 --> 00:25:55,892
She's...
- I know she's your friend.

288
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,897
I mistook her for you,
and hugged her like this...

289
00:25:57,965 --> 00:25:58,989
Ria!

290
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:00,829
What are you doing?

291
00:26:00,868 --> 00:26:02,495
She doesn't like all this.

292
00:26:02,736 --> 00:26:04,761
So, what does she like?
- Ria, where are you?

293
00:26:04,838 --> 00:26:05,827
Coming.

294
00:26:07,674 --> 00:26:09,574
Come on, Ram.

295
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,836
Come on.

296
00:26:11,011 --> 00:26:12,638
Ram! No, monkey.

297
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,382
So what's your name?

298
00:26:18,252 --> 00:26:19,651
I know you won't tell me.

299
00:26:20,254 --> 00:26:23,690
My name's Ram. I'm from Australia.

300
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:31,629
People say, boys who come from out of India
are spoilt, manner less, crooks and conmen.

301
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:33,494
They're right.

302
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:35,267
I am exactly like that.

303
00:26:35,836 --> 00:26:37,269
So beware.

304
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:46,639
Where's the sugar?

305
00:26:46,914 --> 00:26:47,881
Sugar...

306
00:26:48,415 --> 00:26:50,906
Sugar... What happened?

307
00:26:51,051 --> 00:26:54,748
Why are you so scared?
- I thought that monkey's back.

308
00:26:54,922 --> 00:26:57,823
Who?
- The one who has come from Australia.

309
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,587
He was raised in Australia.

310
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:05,496
Not every foreigner is so spoilt.

311
00:27:05,532 --> 00:27:07,693
It's not his fault, its his parents...

312
00:27:07,768 --> 00:27:09,759
...who raised him like this.

313
00:27:10,437 --> 00:27:14,305
If I ever meet his parents,
I will question them face-to-face.

314
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:15,703
Isn't it correct aunt.

315
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,279
Do you know who you are talking to?

316
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,004
Ria's aunt.

317
00:27:24,818 --> 00:27:27,685
That Australian monkey is her son.
- Is it?

318
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,792
"Hold..."

319
00:27:46,606 --> 00:27:48,267
Need some sugar.

320
00:27:53,613 --> 00:27:54,705
That's better.

321
00:27:55,349 --> 00:28:00,810
"Everyone lacks a little sweetness..."

322
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,857
Let's go.

323
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:07,758
Welcome.

324
00:28:08,495 --> 00:28:09,553
How are you, dear?
- Fine.

325
00:28:09,629 --> 00:28:11,563
Hello, sister-in-law.
- Hello.

326
00:28:11,631 --> 00:28:14,600
He's my partner in the construction business.
- I see.

327
00:28:14,668 --> 00:28:15,896
JP. Jai Prakash.

328
00:28:16,603 --> 00:28:19,231
Oh Yes. He was with
the Central Ministry for 20 years.

329
00:28:19,306 --> 00:28:20,603
Please don't...

330
00:28:20,674 --> 00:28:22,801
She's my sister Ashwini.
- From Australia.

331
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:24,434
Hello.

332
00:28:24,511 --> 00:28:26,570
Aunt.
- She is the one with the son?

333
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,444
Yes. - You promised that her son and my...
- Right, right.

334
00:28:29,516 --> 00:28:30,574
Then introduce me to him.

335
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,548
Let's go in first.

336
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:32,743
Come in.

337
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,511
Let's go.

338
00:28:42,362 --> 00:28:43,954
Sona, look at this.
- Nice.

339
00:28:44,297 --> 00:28:45,525
I have got the news from the kitchen...

340
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,692
That you called me a monkey.
- No!

341
00:28:47,868 --> 00:28:49,301
Australian monkey.

342
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,664
Wow!

343
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:52,799
My mistake.

344
00:28:52,873 --> 00:28:54,670
Should've called you a Gorilla.

345
00:28:54,808 --> 00:28:57,743
Ria!

346
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,407
There he is.

347
00:29:14,261 --> 00:29:15,455
Get lost.

348
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,492
Hi. I'm Dolly.
- Hi.

349
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:21,295
Hi, I'm Bijli.

350
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:23,268
Bijli. Bijli.
- Whatever.

351
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,498
Come on. Let's dance.
- Sure.

352
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:31,272
Ouch.

353
00:29:34,714 --> 00:29:36,841
Everyone in India
wear saris and salwars.

354
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,579
And it's so colorful.

355
00:29:39,453 --> 00:29:40,818
Okay, dad. Take care.

356
00:29:41,021 --> 00:29:41,953
Got to go.

357
00:29:43,924 --> 00:29:45,414
What are you doing in my room?

358
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,487
This is my room. Get out!

359
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,491
Sorry. My mistake.

360
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,989
Did you see anything?
- No, I...

361
00:29:54,568 --> 00:29:56,035
Just get out.
- Thank God!

362
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:58,800
Nice horse.

363
00:29:59,372 --> 00:30:00,669
Don't touch that.

364
00:30:07,914 --> 00:30:08,642
Hey!

365
00:30:18,892 --> 00:30:20,621
My brother gifted me that.

366
00:30:21,995 --> 00:30:22,825
Please!

367
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,454
Your brother gave it to you?

368
00:30:45,018 --> 00:30:47,043
Get out of here!
- Okay.

369
00:30:52,826 --> 00:30:53,815
I have a doubt.

370
00:30:55,495 --> 00:30:56,894
I troubled you so much.

371
00:30:57,831 --> 00:31:01,597
Any other girl would've slapped me.

372
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,460
But you didn't.

373
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:04,863
Does that mean...

374
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,474
Something-something.
- What?

375
00:31:09,976 --> 00:31:13,468
Something-something.
- Nothing.

376
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,552
"Touch me... Touch me."

377
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:22,986
"Hold me... Hold me..."

378
00:31:23,056 --> 00:31:26,548
Ram. You're nude.
- Now, you're nude.

379
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:36,966
I didn't know I could
have that effect on women.

380
00:31:37,337 --> 00:31:38,861
"Touch me... Touch me."

381
00:31:39,306 --> 00:31:40,603
Let's begin.

382
00:31:40,674 --> 00:31:43,837
Where's Ram?
- Must be around.

383
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:52,680
Dear. Ram.

384
00:31:52,852 --> 00:31:54,080
Ram.

385
00:31:55,855 --> 00:31:58,085
Tell her to get close to Ram.

386
00:32:04,564 --> 00:32:05,531
What's wrong?

387
00:32:06,499 --> 00:32:09,957
Don't worry,
She'll get too close for comfort.

388
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:15,535
"Let's see..."

389
00:32:15,942 --> 00:32:18,467
"Who's got the strength."

390
00:32:18,678 --> 00:32:21,340
"Keep a firm foot ahead."

391
00:32:21,615 --> 00:32:25,517
"My friend."

392
00:32:28,922 --> 00:32:32,551
This jacket belongs to
that Australian monkey.

393
00:32:33,727 --> 00:32:35,456
Ria!

394
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,788
Now I'll show you.

395
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,996
Mogambo's pleased!

396
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:58,915
I hate your name!

397
00:33:15,802 --> 00:33:18,464
"Let's see..."

398
00:33:18,905 --> 00:33:20,964
"Who's got the strength."

399
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,474
Ram!

400
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,045
Have you seen Ram around?
- No.

401
00:33:29,316 --> 00:33:30,908
But he isn't there.

402
00:33:31,318 --> 00:33:32,910
Hi.
- Hi.

403
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,047
Hi, Dolly.
- You naughty.

404
00:33:35,322 --> 00:33:38,723
So there you are.
- No. Here I am.

405
00:33:39,025 --> 00:33:40,686
Okay, listen.

406
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,024
Don't make any plans for the evening.

407
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,327
My friends are coming over. Okay.

408
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,030
Ram. They're my friends.

409
00:33:49,302 --> 00:33:50,826
Radhika. Rashmi.

410
00:33:50,937 --> 00:33:52,928
Pooja and Aanchal.

411
00:33:53,473 --> 00:33:56,636
This is my bermuda,
my t-shirt and that's my slippers.

412
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,405
Shut up and get back.

413
00:33:59,813 --> 00:34:01,610
You keep working the entire day.

414
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:03,814
Come and sit here.

415
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,015
Wow!

416
00:34:08,722 --> 00:34:10,417
But I didn't make this.

417
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,616
That's why he liked it.

418
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:14,290
She's fuming.

419
00:34:14,494 --> 00:34:18,328
So, who was I talking about?
- Ram. Ram!

420
00:34:19,332 --> 00:34:23,860
Ram's dad is amongst top 500
billionaires of Australia.

421
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,404
A big mansion.

422
00:34:25,472 --> 00:34:27,667
100 acres of a plush estate.

423
00:34:27,874 --> 00:34:29,432
And a private chartered plane.

424
00:34:29,509 --> 00:34:31,739
You're not too far-off either, Dolly.

425
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:35,346
Of course. My dad's a billionaire too.

426
00:34:35,415 --> 00:34:36,939
We've ministers for breakfast.

427
00:34:37,016 --> 00:34:38,483
Actors for lunch.

428
00:34:38,551 --> 00:34:40,451
And builders for evening snacks.

429
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,385
Does your father run a mess?

430
00:34:42,856 --> 00:34:44,380
Don't mess with me.

431
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:48,953
So Ram's a billionaire and so am I.

432
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:51,058
In fact, we all are rich.

433
00:34:51,431 --> 00:34:52,955
We've everything.

434
00:34:53,066 --> 00:34:57,503
But what about you?
- I'm rich too.

435
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,729
Really? What do you have?

436
00:34:59,939 --> 00:35:02,373
We've a small house back in the village.

437
00:35:02,442 --> 00:35:05,309
10 acres land. 20 bulls.

438
00:35:05,378 --> 00:35:08,814
25 cows. 40 hens and 100 goats.

439
00:35:08,948 --> 00:35:11,576
But I also have a brother...

440
00:35:12,385 --> 00:35:14,012
...who loves me more than his life.

441
00:35:15,555 --> 00:35:19,355
And his love is invaluable for me.

442
00:35:21,628 --> 00:35:23,823
Sona. Let's go.
- Yes.

443
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,424
Bye, Ram!
- Bye sona.

444
00:35:34,941 --> 00:35:36,499
What are you looking at?

445
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:39,670
Don't know how, but Everyday
I see something new in Sona.

446
00:35:39,746 --> 00:35:42,408
But why?
- She's something.

447
00:35:43,817 --> 00:35:44,909
Something-something.

448
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,379
Sona's finished her studies.

449
00:35:49,622 --> 00:35:51,021
Get her married this year.

450
00:35:51,558 --> 00:35:54,493
I will, if I find a good match.

451
00:35:54,561 --> 00:35:56,028
Yes.

452
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:59,760
My son's done his graduation in farming.

453
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:02,961
We've been getting proposals
from affluent families.

454
00:36:03,403 --> 00:36:07,965
But... he wants to marry your sister.

455
00:36:10,844 --> 00:36:12,903
Do you have an objection?

456
00:36:15,782 --> 00:36:19,309
Sona...
- Oh! You want to take her consent.

457
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:25,654
And I will have to consult sir too.
- Yeah right.

458
00:36:36,703 --> 00:36:38,898
Why are you crying on
such a happy occasion?

459
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:42,634
Soon my daughter will also get
married and leave for Australia.

460
00:36:43,009 --> 00:36:44,909
You think pretty positive.

461
00:36:45,612 --> 00:36:46,806
What are you doing?

462
00:36:47,514 --> 00:36:49,744
I've already brought
tickets to Australia.

463
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,049
Hello.

464
00:36:59,325 --> 00:37:00,724
Now, I'll read out
the wedding invitation.

465
00:37:00,793 --> 00:37:02,886
Sri Krishnakant Bhargav's daughter Ria.

466
00:37:02,962 --> 00:37:03,621
Who is that?

467
00:37:03,696 --> 00:37:06,221
Sri Krishnakant Bhargav's daughter Ria.

468
00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:06,731
Who is that?

469
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:09,495
Sri Krishnakant Bhargav's daughter Ria.

470
00:37:09,569 --> 00:37:11,560
Priest. Please carry on.

471
00:37:11,704 --> 00:37:13,865
Sri Krishnakant Bhargav's daughter Ria.

472
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,407
Stop this nonsense.

473
00:37:15,475 --> 00:37:18,603
Why did you stop?
- He asked me to stop.

474
00:37:18,678 --> 00:37:19,940
Please continue.

475
00:37:20,013 --> 00:37:20,945
Continue. Continue.

476
00:37:21,915 --> 00:37:23,940
Excuse me. Excuse me.

477
00:37:25,318 --> 00:37:26,342
Hi.

478
00:37:27,353 --> 00:37:29,253
When are you getting married?
- What?

479
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,748
I've a friend.

480
00:37:30,823 --> 00:37:34,782
He's got 10 hens, 4 bulls and a horse.

481
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:35,793
He'll be a perfect match for you.

482
00:37:35,862 --> 00:37:36,760
Tea.

483
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:39,364
Bijli. What's the time?

484
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,268
I don't have a watch.

485
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:46,370
You don't have a brain either.
- I know.

486
00:37:48,908 --> 00:37:50,671
Let's go there.
- Yes, let's go.

487
00:37:50,777 --> 00:37:53,302
Sister.

488
00:37:53,446 --> 00:37:56,574
You just made this party come alive.
- Thank you.

489
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,742
You're the star of this party.

490
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,787
Why are you repeating the old lines, say something new.
- That's very nice of you.

491
00:38:02,455 --> 00:38:05,288
Only one thing is missing.
- What's that?

492
00:38:06,926 --> 00:38:11,886
What's this?
- A small, petty necklace.

493
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:15,466
Looks pretty expensive though...

494
00:38:15,535 --> 00:38:16,593
It just cost 2.5 million.

495
00:38:16,703 --> 00:38:18,898
You're trying to butter.

496
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:22,399
This wasn't required.
- It's okay.

497
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,368
Every time I see them together.

498
00:38:26,613 --> 00:38:28,672
I feel happy, sister.

499
00:38:28,748 --> 00:38:29,976
I feel really content.

500
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,008
But I feel like puking.
I can't stand it.

501
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,520
Hi, guys...
- People call me Bijli Gaga...

502
00:38:41,828 --> 00:38:42,852
Hey, everyone.

503
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:45,625
This is Ram. My boyfriend.
- Hey.

504
00:38:45,898 --> 00:38:48,628
Come closer, Ram.

505
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,304
Get off me, you dirty pig.

506
00:38:54,607 --> 00:38:56,472
Pig loves you!

507
00:38:56,509 --> 00:38:58,477
Pig loves you!

508
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,536
Shiraz said that.
- No, baby, it was Prabhu.

509
00:39:01,614 --> 00:39:03,639
No, it was Mr. Kumar.

510
00:39:04,651 --> 00:39:06,949
So, cuddling up!

511
00:39:08,287 --> 00:39:09,618
Spoilsport!

512
00:39:15,294 --> 00:39:16,283
Wow!

513
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,301
Hi!

514
00:39:25,805 --> 00:39:27,295
She's my best friend.

515
00:39:27,373 --> 00:39:28,897
And she's Rinki and Jazz...
- Hi.

516
00:39:28,975 --> 00:39:30,670
Ma'am, the buffet's ready.

517
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,538
You talk to them, I shall be back. Ok?
- Okay.

518
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,873
Nice party, isn't it?
- Yeah.

519
00:39:45,491 --> 00:39:47,686
Why are you following me?
- My wish.

520
00:39:47,794 --> 00:39:49,318
Come to the side.

521
00:39:53,466 --> 00:39:55,400
Put some chicken pieces and...
- Go away.

522
00:39:55,568 --> 00:39:57,593
What would people say?

523
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:02,840
That's why I am saying, come to the side.
- I won't.

524
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,304
Your zip is open.

525
00:40:06,546 --> 00:40:08,377
You're lying.

526
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,707
You've a mole ten inches
below your neck. Right?

527
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:21,520
"Stranger, don't leave me."

528
00:40:23,396 --> 00:40:24,920
I told you...

529
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,822
Your friend's calling you.

530
00:40:30,036 --> 00:40:31,298
What happened?

531
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,372
It's stuck.

532
00:40:39,612 --> 00:40:40,408
Come on.

533
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:01,965
Thanks.

534
00:41:02,702 --> 00:41:06,570
What?
- You're a monkey, but a nice one.

535
00:41:06,606 --> 00:41:09,439
What? You praised me.

536
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,807
Not bad.

537
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,707
Something?
- Nothing.

538
00:41:14,781 --> 00:41:16,009
Something-something.

539
00:41:16,282 --> 00:41:17,772
Nothing-nothing.

540
00:41:21,554 --> 00:41:22,919
Yes.

541
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:12,847
Dance with me?

542
00:45:13,986 --> 00:45:16,750
Wow! Something-something?

543
00:45:16,856 --> 00:45:17,880
Something-something.

544
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,623
He was my friend in college.

545
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,436
He gave me champagne to drink
on his birthday party.

546
00:45:32,505 --> 00:45:34,370
I was slightly drunk.

547
00:45:35,574 --> 00:45:37,974
He was shooting me.

548
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:42,342
And was also trying to kiss me.

549
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:48,651
Now he's trying to
black-mail me with that clip.

550
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:52,952
He's asked Ria for money
and herjewellery.

551
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:55,720
Otherwise, he'll upload
the clip on the internet.

552
00:45:56,062 --> 00:45:57,723
That clip's on his l-pad.

553
00:46:02,668 --> 00:46:05,831
Is this what you meant
by "Something-something".

554
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,399
Only someone of our age
can understand our problem.

555
00:46:09,742 --> 00:46:11,573
I didn't know what to do.

556
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,672
That's why I talked to you.

557
00:46:35,868 --> 00:46:38,837
Let's search.
- Yes.

558
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,907
That way.

559
00:47:14,907 --> 00:47:16,374
What now?

560
00:47:17,576 --> 00:47:18,543
Watch me.

561
00:47:21,847 --> 00:47:22,939
Brother!

562
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,878
Why didn't you close the door?

563
00:47:29,955 --> 00:47:31,582
Why didn't you do it?

564
00:47:31,657 --> 00:47:34,421
Did you have to yell so loud?

565
00:47:35,294 --> 00:47:36,784
But I...
- Wait.

566
00:47:42,034 --> 00:47:43,626
Pass me that bottle of shampoo.

567
00:47:44,503 --> 00:47:46,494
You want to take a bath now?

568
00:47:47,439 --> 00:47:48,736
What now?

569
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:51,936
Watch him run away.

570
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:58,577
He's dangerous.

571
00:47:59,685 --> 00:48:00,743
Get down.

572
00:48:00,953 --> 00:48:01,920
Get down.

573
00:48:01,987 --> 00:48:04,512
Think about getting out of here.

574
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:05,948
Idea!

575
00:48:06,225 --> 00:48:07,283
You go this way.

576
00:48:07,393 --> 00:48:08,451
The dog will chase you.

577
00:48:08,494 --> 00:48:10,860
And I'll escape from her with the l-pad.

578
00:48:12,298 --> 00:48:13,856
Was that ajoke?
- No, I'm serious.

579
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:16,868
Then why don't you go out.
- Hey!

580
00:48:18,704 --> 00:48:20,467
He'll bite you.

581
00:48:21,674 --> 00:48:22,800
I like it.

582
00:48:23,676 --> 00:48:24,973
I totally like it.

583
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,781
Madam. Take a seat.

584
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:43,826
Go ahead. Keep it on my head.

585
00:48:43,896 --> 00:48:45,295
Chill.

586
00:48:53,572 --> 00:48:57,269
What now?
- Sing a song!

587
00:48:57,443 --> 00:48:58,876
You like my voice so much.

588
00:48:58,944 --> 00:49:01,845
It will shoo away the dog.

589
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:32,433
Turn it off.

590
00:49:34,613 --> 00:49:36,410
Turn it off.

591
00:49:55,734 --> 00:49:57,031
It's my phone.

592
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,766
Hey, Lisa.

593
00:50:03,008 --> 00:50:04,873
I'm in the bathroom taking a shower.

594
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:06,637
Call you later.

595
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,043
She's my girlfriend.
- I didn't ask.

596
00:50:11,317 --> 00:50:12,579
I thought you might.

597
00:50:13,485 --> 00:50:15,453
Doesn't make a difference to me.

598
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,548
By the way, how many
girlfriends do you have?

599
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,760
14! Including you.

600
00:50:24,963 --> 00:50:29,730
I am not your girlfriend!
- Girls always say the opposite.

601
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,038
I mean I am.
- That's what I said.

602
00:50:34,306 --> 00:50:35,705
But I...
- Oh, come on.

603
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:37,706
There were other boys
and girls in the party too.

604
00:50:37,776 --> 00:50:39,641
But you asked for my help.

605
00:50:39,678 --> 00:50:40,474
Why?

606
00:50:40,546 --> 00:50:42,571
Because you consider me a friend.

607
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,545
Girl, friend.

608
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:49,452
Girlfriend.
- Fine.

609
00:50:49,488 --> 00:50:51,456
But not the other type.

610
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,749
Everyone has friends.

611
00:50:53,892 --> 00:50:56,656
But only one special someone
makes a place in their heart.

612
00:50:56,862 --> 00:50:59,797
I do have someone,
you must have one too.

613
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:01,456
Who is he?

614
00:51:03,836 --> 00:51:05,394
Look...
- Where?

615
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:11,273
The shower's gone off.
- Great discovery.

616
00:51:11,343 --> 00:51:13,777
Think of a way to get out.

617
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,012
Google. Google.

618
00:51:16,415 --> 00:51:17,541
Idea no.2.
- What?

619
00:51:17,649 --> 00:51:18,707
I'll tease the dog.

620
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,446
The dog will get in from here and
we'll get out from the other side.

621
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,985
Why didn't you think of this earlier?

622
00:51:23,055 --> 00:51:25,285
So that I could say it now.

623
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:38,736
Go, go, go, go. Let's go, Sona.

624
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,739
Let's go.

625
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:45,772
Come on. He's gone.

626
00:51:45,844 --> 00:51:46,902
Let's go.

627
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,643
Come on.

628
00:51:51,683 --> 00:51:53,810
Hey!
- Brother!

629
00:51:55,888 --> 00:51:56,820
Give me my l-Pad back.

630
00:51:56,889 --> 00:52:00,848
Or else I will shoot.
- Shoot me.

631
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:02,884
No. You shouldn't shoot girls.

632
00:52:02,961 --> 00:52:03,620
Shoot me.

633
00:52:03,695 --> 00:52:05,856
No. Shoot me.

634
00:52:09,902 --> 00:52:11,961
The gun's empty.

635
00:52:12,805 --> 00:52:13,965
But I still have the gun.

636
00:52:17,409 --> 00:52:20,276
Rascal, how dare you blackmail girls!

637
00:52:25,417 --> 00:52:26,611
What happened?

638
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,287
Sorry, Ria.

639
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,582
Oh, my God!

640
00:52:31,924 --> 00:52:33,789
Why are you bothering her? Come on.

641
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:36,688
Here's his l-Pad and phone.

642
00:52:39,731 --> 00:52:40,891
Thank God!

643
00:52:42,501 --> 00:52:44,560
Thanks.
- No, thank him.

644
00:52:44,903 --> 00:52:46,370
No, thank Sona.

645
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:49,530
He went through a lot more trouble than me.
- No. Thank her.

646
00:52:49,608 --> 00:52:51,599
Okay. Thanks to both of you.

647
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:54,311
Why should there be formalities between friends.
- Right.

648
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,479
It's okay, I don't mind.

649
00:53:00,486 --> 00:53:01,418
Okay, Goodnight.

650
00:53:11,029 --> 00:53:12,326
Ram.

651
00:53:23,642 --> 00:53:24,631
Friends!

652
00:53:29,348 --> 00:53:31,680
Only friends. Nothing else.

653
00:53:32,885 --> 00:53:34,045
Okay, okay.

654
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,978
Friends.

655
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,747
What happened?

656
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,344
My glass...

657
00:54:22,901 --> 00:54:25,335
Go, get the ball.

658
00:54:34,513 --> 00:54:37,277
Loser! Loser! Loser!

659
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:39,283
Loser! I'll show you all.

660
00:54:39,851 --> 00:54:42,615
Loser! Loser! Loser!

661
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,790
Please don't touch!

662
00:54:56,535 --> 00:54:58,469
That was fun.

663
00:54:59,738 --> 00:55:02,263
Did that horse belong to you?
- Yes.

664
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:05,635
The ball knocked it over and it broke.

665
00:55:08,981 --> 00:55:10,505
Sona!

666
00:55:30,969 --> 00:55:33,529
It's always been with you, right?

667
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,835
My brother gave this to me.

668
00:55:37,342 --> 00:55:39,867
I love it more than my life.

669
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:42,809
I never thought I'd lose it someday.

670
00:55:58,664 --> 00:56:00,325
Counting the stars.

671
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:04,232
I'll alsojoin.

672
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:10,841
One, two, three, four...

673
00:56:11,476 --> 00:56:18,575
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

674
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:20,015
Calculation went for a toss.

675
00:56:36,334 --> 00:56:37,323
It's the same one.

676
00:56:37,836 --> 00:56:39,599
The one your brother gave you.

677
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,804
I went through a lot of
trouble to put it back together.

678
00:56:55,620 --> 00:57:00,557
It had too many marks on it.

679
00:57:01,526 --> 00:57:03,585
I decorated it to cover them up.

680
00:57:04,529 --> 00:57:06,554
You can take it off
if you don't like it...

681
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:13,404
It's nice.
- Thanks, Ram.

682
00:57:15,574 --> 00:57:18,407
Since you didn't mention,
I thanked myself.

683
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,474
Okay, bye.
- Ram!

684
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:25,976
You called.

685
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:31,885
Why did you take so much trouble for me?

686
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:35,293
You want me to be honest?
- Yes.

687
00:57:37,596 --> 00:57:39,496
To see this smile on your face.

688
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,400
Is that all?
- Yes.

689
00:57:44,569 --> 00:57:46,298
Nothing else?
- No.

690
00:57:46,438 --> 00:57:47,962
Not even something-something?
- No.

691
00:57:51,943 --> 00:57:52,807
What?

692
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,945
Brother. Someone's
come between you and Sona.

693
01:01:23,521 --> 01:01:24,954
Who can come between us?

694
01:01:25,023 --> 01:01:26,752
Take a look for yourself.

695
01:01:26,791 --> 01:01:27,951
Come with me. Come on.

696
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:30,789
Quickly.

697
01:01:31,329 --> 01:01:33,763
Look.
- Where?

698
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,625
That's you. That's Sona.

699
01:01:36,701 --> 01:01:39,295
And there's a third
star between you two.

700
01:01:39,871 --> 01:01:41,930
No one can come between us.

701
01:01:42,007 --> 01:01:43,998
It's just probably for a while.

702
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:47,401
Get back to work.
- If you say so.

703
01:01:47,545 --> 01:01:49,012
But I was worried.

704
01:01:51,983 --> 01:01:55,009
That's Sona. That's Sona's brother.

705
01:01:55,453 --> 01:01:56,613
Who's the third one?

706
01:01:56,688 --> 01:01:59,020
What?
- Nothing.

707
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:01,320
Nothing.

708
01:02:09,634 --> 01:02:12,000
Are you going to wear
glasses during the rituals?

709
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,397
She'll wear them even
on her wedding night.

710
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:19,037
Even if she does, the lights in
the room will be switched off.

711
01:02:20,412 --> 01:02:21,845
You shouldn't talking
all this at your age.

712
01:02:21,913 --> 01:02:24,848
At my age, all I can do is talk.

713
01:03:42,827 --> 01:03:44,692
Not mine. Take your aunt's blessings.

714
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:46,328
Bless you.
- Mom.

715
01:03:46,397 --> 01:03:48,957
Did you ever hit me?
- Why you?

716
01:03:49,434 --> 01:03:51,834
She'll hit your father.
- Uncle, please.

717
01:03:52,437 --> 01:03:57,340
Mom, I'm serious. Have you ever hit me?
- Never. But...

718
01:04:03,581 --> 01:04:04,775
Hi, buddy. How are you?

719
01:04:04,849 --> 01:04:07,943
Dad, did you ever hit me?
- What are you saying?

720
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,784
How can anyone think of hitting you?

721
01:04:10,955 --> 01:04:12,354
What's wrong?

722
01:04:12,924 --> 01:04:14,687
Okay, dad. I'll call you later.

723
01:04:41,886 --> 01:04:43,444
Ram!
- What?

724
01:04:50,328 --> 01:04:51,590
I am sorry, Ram!

725
01:04:51,663 --> 01:04:52,857
I am sorry.

726
01:04:53,731 --> 01:04:56,291
Ram. It was my mistake.

727
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,732
You can kiss me if you want.

728
01:04:59,971 --> 01:05:02,462
Forgive me.
- Sona.

729
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:03,598
I am sorry, Ram.

730
01:05:03,675 --> 01:05:04,642
I am sorry.

731
01:05:04,709 --> 01:05:06,472
I am sorry.

732
01:05:15,386 --> 01:05:16,876
I am also sorry, Sona.

733
01:05:29,367 --> 01:05:33,827
Ram! I am very happy today.
- Me too.

734
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,937
What were you two thinking?

735
01:05:41,412 --> 01:05:45,712
I won't find out about you two?
- Please, Ria.

736
01:05:45,883 --> 01:05:46,815
Please, Ria.

737
01:05:46,884 --> 01:05:50,650
While arrangements for
my marriage were on...

738
01:05:50,888 --> 01:05:53,686
You two were planning your own, right?

739
01:05:53,891 --> 01:05:55,449
Please, Ria.

740
01:05:56,694 --> 01:05:58,321
Let me get married.

741
01:05:58,396 --> 01:06:01,991
I'll get you two married too.
- Ria.

742
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:04,566
Phone.

743
01:06:06,938 --> 01:06:08,405
Give it.
- Hurry up.

744
01:06:08,573 --> 01:06:09,835
Or sir will give the green signal.

745
01:06:09,907 --> 01:06:11,534
So much luggage?

746
01:06:11,609 --> 01:06:13,474
As if your own sister's getting married.

747
01:06:13,544 --> 01:06:17,412
I've a sister, but Ria doesn't have a brother.
- I see.

748
01:06:17,482 --> 01:06:18,574
See you.

749
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:21,009
Hey! You forgot this.

750
01:06:21,452 --> 01:06:23,647
Look after the house. Be careful.

751
01:06:25,323 --> 01:06:27,416
Gauri, be careful.

752
01:06:31,763 --> 01:06:34,323
What are you doing?
- Deleting your number.

753
01:06:34,766 --> 01:06:35,664
Why?

754
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,661
I won't attend this marriage.

755
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:39,762
This marriage will get over today.

756
01:06:39,837 --> 01:06:40,895
Tomorrow, everyone will return.

757
01:06:40,972 --> 01:06:42,803
Leaving me and my daughter behind.

758
01:06:43,308 --> 01:06:44,707
What are you looking at?

759
01:06:44,776 --> 01:06:45,765
Look at me.

760
01:06:45,843 --> 01:06:47,674
I see, so that's the problem.

761
01:06:48,646 --> 01:06:51,740
Sister.
- Yes, brother. What is it?

762
01:06:51,949 --> 01:06:54,975
Can you tell him what were
we talking about yesterday?

763
01:06:55,486 --> 01:06:56,418
What?

764
01:06:56,521 --> 01:06:59,513
About Ram and Dolly.
- Yes.

765
01:06:59,624 --> 01:07:01,990
Mister. We accept your proposal.

766
01:07:02,794 --> 01:07:04,227
But let this marriage get over.

767
01:07:04,295 --> 01:07:05,728
We shall talk about it in detail.

768
01:07:07,765 --> 01:07:10,233
Aunt!
- Bless you.

769
01:07:10,702 --> 01:07:13,000
Let's go. The procession's arriving.
- Yes, aunty.

770
01:07:13,504 --> 01:07:16,473
What are you doing?
- Give me your phone number.

771
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:53,335
Welcome. Welcome.
- Bless you.

772
01:07:53,411 --> 01:07:54,742
Let that be.

773
01:07:55,012 --> 01:07:57,446
Talk about cash. Money.

774
01:07:57,548 --> 01:07:58,742
Where's the money?
- This way.

775
01:07:58,816 --> 01:08:00,010
This way.
- Inside.

776
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:01,478
Get it out!

777
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:06,446
What are you doing?

778
01:08:07,992 --> 01:08:10,392
Hey! Why do you keep troubling her?

779
01:08:10,428 --> 01:08:12,362
Today's the last day to have some fun.

780
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:15,458
Once the marriage is over, There
won't be any chance to do all this.

781
01:08:19,003 --> 01:08:20,561
What's wrong with you?

782
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:26,001
You're upset because you'll miss
me in Australia. Correct? - Yes.

783
01:08:27,245 --> 01:08:28,269
Listen...

784
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:31,743
What are you doing?

785
01:08:31,916 --> 01:08:33,349
Let go of my hand.

786
01:08:33,951 --> 01:08:35,646
Ram, leave my hand.

787
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,948
Someone might see us.

788
01:08:37,021 --> 01:08:37,988
You're always in a fun mood...

789
01:08:38,256 --> 01:08:39,883
I'm going back to Australia tomorrow.

790
01:08:43,961 --> 01:08:51,390
People say boys who come from out of
India are conmen, flirt and spoilt brats.

791
01:08:51,903 --> 01:08:55,703
No. I am not one of them, Sona.

792
01:08:56,607 --> 01:08:57,665
I love you.

793
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:10,311
As soon as I get to Australia,
I'll talk to dad about us.

794
01:09:11,656 --> 01:09:12,850
And your brother too.

795
01:09:27,305 --> 01:09:28,294
Dolly. Let go.

796
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:29,862
I love Ram.
- Let go!

797
01:09:29,941 --> 01:09:31,408
Let go.
- I want to die.

798
01:09:31,442 --> 01:09:32,409
Dear, you'll hurt yourself.

799
01:09:32,443 --> 01:09:34,274
What are you doing?

800
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:38,940
Aunt...
- We should teach her a lesson

801
01:09:39,317 --> 01:09:41,717
Such girls are always on a
look out to entice rich boys.

802
01:09:42,019 --> 01:09:44,920
If we don't act now, we'll lose Ram.

803
01:09:44,989 --> 01:09:46,013
I mean it.

804
01:09:52,263 --> 01:09:53,662
Come on.
- Ram!

805
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:58,899
Come here.
- What, mom?

806
01:09:59,871 --> 01:10:04,001
You will have to go
to the jewellery shop right now. - Now?

807
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:05,432
Why?

808
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:10,813
Ria's my niece.

809
01:10:10,882 --> 01:10:13,783
I wanted to gift her
gold bangles on her wedding.

810
01:10:13,851 --> 01:10:18,015
But I forgot to get them.
- But how am I going to choose?

811
01:10:18,523 --> 01:10:21,720
Take Bijli along, if
you can't do it alone.

812
01:10:22,293 --> 01:10:24,693
Bijli.
- Yes, aunt's right.

813
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:27,829
Let's go or we'll miss the wedding.

814
01:10:27,865 --> 01:10:29,958
There isn't any need to hurry.

815
01:10:32,403 --> 01:10:36,066
Get some nice and
expensive bangles. Okay?

816
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:38,533
Come on.

817
01:10:38,676 --> 01:10:39,938
Let's go.

818
01:10:53,024 --> 01:10:54,685
Aunt, would you like some tea?

819
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:05,526
How old are you?
- 20.

820
01:11:06,504 --> 01:11:09,598
You look smarter for your age.

821
01:11:14,679 --> 01:11:15,668
Let's go.

822
01:11:15,913 --> 01:11:16,902
Let's go.

823
01:11:17,415 --> 01:11:18,677
Let's go, everyone.

824
01:11:18,883 --> 01:11:22,546
Who else is there in your family?
- Just an elder brother.

825
01:11:23,421 --> 01:11:26,288
What does he do?
- Farming.

826
01:11:28,292 --> 01:11:29,486
Farming!

827
01:11:30,394 --> 01:11:33,386
We have a poultry farm
and we sell milk too.

828
01:11:34,031 --> 01:11:36,363
Did you take your brother's permission...

829
01:11:36,434 --> 01:11:38,925
...to attend this wedding?
- Yes, aunt.

830
01:11:39,303 --> 01:11:41,703
I never do anything
without my brother's permission.

831
01:11:41,806 --> 01:11:43,831
Then you must've taken his permission...

832
01:11:44,075 --> 01:11:46,066
...to entice my son.

833
01:11:48,646 --> 01:11:49,635
Why are you quiet?

834
01:11:49,714 --> 01:11:50,942
What would she say now.

835
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,643
Her entire plan has been ruined now.

836
01:11:55,319 --> 01:11:56,343
Ria.

837
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:58,354
Your aunt's yelling at Sona.

838
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:00,821
I was really impressed...

839
01:12:00,958 --> 01:12:02,789
...at how hard this girl's working.

840
01:12:02,994 --> 01:12:05,394
Now I understood what she was up to.

841
01:12:06,897 --> 01:12:09,024
Why are you yelling at her?

842
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,562
We were busy with the wedding.

843
01:12:10,635 --> 01:12:13,570
And she grabbed the
opportunity to entice Ram.

844
01:12:13,638 --> 01:12:15,265
Don't say that, uncle.

845
01:12:15,339 --> 01:12:17,603
Ram likes her too.
- Yes.

846
01:12:17,675 --> 01:12:19,006
That's what her plan is.

847
01:12:19,276 --> 01:12:20,641
Uncle, please...
- Shut up, Ria.

848
01:12:20,745 --> 01:12:21,973
Let us adults handle this.

849
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:22,978
But...
- Quiet!

850
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:26,676
If you have any shame
then leave right now.

851
01:12:26,784 --> 01:12:28,445
And find someone else.

852
01:12:51,776 --> 01:12:53,903
See. Didn't I tell you?

853
01:12:53,978 --> 01:12:56,003
She can't stay without me at all.

854
01:12:56,881 --> 01:12:58,940
See. How is she crying.

855
01:13:02,787 --> 01:13:04,345
Your brother's here.

856
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:06,686
Stop crying like a baby.

857
01:13:09,727 --> 01:13:12,628
Ria. How are you?

858
01:13:12,897 --> 01:13:15,559
Look. I've brought
this wedding sari for you.

859
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,695
Wear this during the nuptial.

860
01:13:17,968 --> 01:13:19,595
You will look really nice.

861
01:13:23,741 --> 01:13:26,039
You must be... Ria's father.

862
01:13:26,377 --> 01:13:29,278
I was rather young when I saw you.

863
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,609
I brought this shawl for you.

864
01:13:36,987 --> 01:13:37,885
Brother!

865
01:13:41,025 --> 01:13:43,493
What's going on?

866
01:13:48,766 --> 01:13:49,790
What happened here, Sona?

867
01:13:49,867 --> 01:13:53,496
See. Both siblings are alike.

868
01:13:53,671 --> 01:13:55,730
We invited you to attend the wedding...

869
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,637
...not to entice rich boys.

870
01:13:57,708 --> 01:13:58,572
What are you saying?

871
01:13:58,609 --> 01:14:02,238
Sister... was flirting
around with a billionaire kid.

872
01:14:02,379 --> 01:14:03,744
And the brother doesn't have a clue.

873
01:14:03,848 --> 01:14:05,008
Hey!

874
01:14:05,716 --> 01:14:09,447
Not a word against my
sister or I will kill you.

875
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,750
If you find out about
your sister's deeds...

876
01:14:11,856 --> 01:14:14,757
...you will beat her black and blue.

877
01:14:14,859 --> 01:14:16,622
Hey!

878
01:14:33,377 --> 01:14:36,005
No, brother. No.

879
01:14:38,382 --> 01:14:40,873
It's your fault, and you
are still fuming at us.

880
01:14:41,051 --> 01:14:42,313
Who are you?

881
01:14:42,386 --> 01:14:47,847
A simple peasant who
works in the fields.

882
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,796
You're not even fit to be our servant.

883
01:14:53,597 --> 01:14:56,395
How dare you try to entice my son?

884
01:14:56,901 --> 01:15:00,359
Get out! Get out of here!

885
01:15:00,905 --> 01:15:02,964
Didn't you hear what she said?

886
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,401
We've seen enough of
your sister's dirty tricks.

887
01:15:05,643 --> 01:15:06,905
Take her away.

888
01:15:11,415 --> 01:15:12,541
Let's go, Sona.

889
01:15:22,593 --> 01:15:26,893
Brother. Please forgive me.

890
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:31,857
It's my sister's wedding,
so I'm leaving quietly.

891
01:15:32,336 --> 01:15:36,272
Otherwise... Each one of you...

892
01:15:38,275 --> 01:15:39,572
Let's go.

893
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:12,067
Hurry up, Bijli. Hurry up.

894
01:16:12,105 --> 01:16:13,538
We're losing time.

895
01:16:13,807 --> 01:16:15,741
Not here, load it in that car.

896
01:16:15,809 --> 01:16:16,571
This car?

897
01:16:16,643 --> 01:16:17,769
Where is everyone?

898
01:16:17,811 --> 01:16:19,301
Here they are.

899
01:16:19,446 --> 01:16:21,505
Call me as soon as you reach, dear.

900
01:16:21,581 --> 01:16:22,775
Yes.

901
01:16:23,683 --> 01:16:26,208
I'll say bye to Ram.
- Go on.

902
01:16:26,286 --> 01:16:28,151
But be quick.
- Yes.

903
01:16:35,195 --> 01:16:38,392
I want to say something before I leave.

904
01:16:38,665 --> 01:16:42,101
Listen only to your heart.

905
01:16:42,402 --> 01:16:45,269
You think Sona left you.

906
01:16:46,506 --> 01:16:49,270
She's left her heart behind for you.

907
01:16:49,676 --> 01:16:52,509
Go take a look in her room.

908
01:16:52,679 --> 01:16:54,704
Let's go, dear. You are getting late.

909
01:17:06,459 --> 01:17:07,858
Bye, Ria.

910
01:17:39,492 --> 01:17:41,653
My brother gave this to me.

911
01:17:41,728 --> 01:17:44,424
I love it more than my life.

912
01:17:44,631 --> 01:17:48,123
I never thought I'd lose it someday.

913
01:17:49,769 --> 01:17:51,168
Ram.

914
01:17:52,105 --> 01:17:53,265
Ram.

915
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:56,509
What are you doing here?

916
01:17:56,643 --> 01:17:58,304
Everyone's waiting for you.

917
01:17:58,378 --> 01:17:59,140
Let's go.

918
01:17:59,212 --> 01:18:00,645
Go on, I'll join you.

919
01:18:03,349 --> 01:18:04,748
We're going back home tomorrow.

920
01:18:05,185 --> 01:18:06,482
You do remember your promise, Don't you?

921
01:18:06,786 --> 01:18:08,219
You're coming with me.

922
01:18:09,255 --> 01:18:10,153
Yes, mom.

923
01:18:10,623 --> 01:18:12,181
The marriage was grand.

924
01:18:12,258 --> 01:18:14,419
But that girl messed things up.
- Forget her.

925
01:18:14,494 --> 01:18:16,121
Look there.
- What?

926
01:18:16,196 --> 01:18:17,356
They look so nice.

927
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:20,524
Made for each other. Is it not?

928
01:18:21,634 --> 01:18:22,726
What's wrong with you?

929
01:18:23,503 --> 01:18:24,731
Why are you so silent?

930
01:18:24,804 --> 01:18:26,567
Juice?
- Leave!

931
01:18:29,742 --> 01:18:31,369
Why are you thinking about her?

932
01:18:31,578 --> 01:18:35,412
She came and left, just
like a passing cloud.

933
01:18:36,082 --> 01:18:39,279
But I... I am still with you.

934
01:18:41,354 --> 01:18:44,221
Can you wait for me?
- Of course I can.

935
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:46,121
One year?
- Yes.

936
01:18:46,826 --> 01:18:47,815
Five years?

937
01:18:51,331 --> 01:18:52,423
15 years?

938
01:18:54,601 --> 01:18:58,128
You can't, but Sona can.

939
01:19:04,777 --> 01:19:07,575
You're the passing cloud, not Sona.

940
01:19:09,282 --> 01:19:12,149
"The clouds are thundering."

941
01:19:12,218 --> 01:19:15,312
"Enraging someone."

942
01:19:16,322 --> 01:19:18,586
Don't pay heed to him, dear.

943
01:19:19,392 --> 01:19:22,225
He or his father has
no say in their family.

944
01:19:22,562 --> 01:19:25,531
They all listen to his mother.

945
01:19:26,366 --> 01:19:28,357
And she has promised me.

946
01:19:44,617 --> 01:19:46,608
I know what you went through.

947
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:49,547
Rich people always behave this way.

948
01:19:49,822 --> 01:19:53,349
Brother got humiliated because of me.

949
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:55,651
Still he didn't say a word to me.

950
01:19:56,629 --> 01:20:00,429
He will get disturb,
looking at you so upset.

951
01:20:01,768 --> 01:20:04,532
Take my advice. Forget everything.

952
01:20:08,508 --> 01:20:10,339
I cannot forget Ram.

953
01:20:12,645 --> 01:20:14,704
What? What are you saying?

954
01:20:15,048 --> 01:20:16,413
Ram didn't catch the flight.

955
01:20:16,482 --> 01:20:18,177
He was with me till Singapore.

956
01:20:18,251 --> 01:20:20,344
But he never got on to
the connecting flight.

957
01:20:22,121 --> 01:20:23,349
He's betrayed me.

958
01:20:23,423 --> 01:20:24,617
What nonsense?

959
01:20:25,091 --> 01:20:27,787
What for?
- Love.

960
01:20:28,227 --> 01:20:29,421
Love?

961
01:20:30,530 --> 01:20:32,225
Oh, my God!

962
01:24:30,136 --> 01:24:31,125
Sona.

963
01:24:50,523 --> 01:24:52,081
Aren't you the Station Master?

964
01:24:56,028 --> 01:24:57,052
And who are you?

965
01:24:57,263 --> 01:24:59,060
How did you come here without a ticket?

966
01:24:59,198 --> 01:25:00,460
I do have a ticket.

967
01:25:16,248 --> 01:25:17,977
Careful, sir.

968
01:25:22,054 --> 01:25:23,043
There was a plate in the way.

969
01:25:23,589 --> 01:25:26,649
Go on. Complete the rituals.

970
01:25:41,474 --> 01:25:42,532
Excuse me, sir.

971
01:25:43,209 --> 01:25:46,372
You're already making me nervous.

972
01:25:46,679 --> 01:25:49,705
I wonder what you will
do after hearing me.

973
01:25:49,782 --> 01:25:51,147
I am Ram.

974
01:25:52,785 --> 01:25:55,515
The same Ram, who is in
love with your sister.

975
01:26:01,394 --> 01:26:02,156
Hi.

976
01:26:03,629 --> 01:26:05,256
Sir. Sir.

977
01:26:05,398 --> 01:26:07,195
Your sister's a really nice girl.

978
01:26:07,433 --> 01:26:09,799
You don't know how long
it took me to woo her.

979
01:26:12,638 --> 01:26:13,662
Sorry.

980
01:26:14,206 --> 01:26:17,232
It wouldn't have
sounded so bad in English.

981
01:26:17,309 --> 01:26:19,675
But what shall I do?
You don't know English.

982
01:26:20,346 --> 01:26:23,076
My family shouldn't have insulted you.

983
01:26:23,315 --> 01:26:24,748
You brought Sona home in rage.

984
01:26:24,817 --> 01:26:26,307
You did the right thing.

985
01:26:27,553 --> 01:26:29,817
I apologize on behalf of my family.

986
01:26:30,423 --> 01:26:31,447
Please Forgive me.

987
01:26:31,524 --> 01:26:32,513
Are you done?

988
01:26:33,259 --> 01:26:34,419
Or do you have anything else to say?

989
01:26:36,495 --> 01:26:39,487
I don't know if I made sense.

990
01:26:39,832 --> 01:26:41,322
But that's what it is.

991
01:26:46,205 --> 01:26:47,331
Come with me.

992
01:26:56,716 --> 01:26:59,276
Raghuveer, why are you taking him inside?

993
01:27:00,286 --> 01:27:03,449
What sir? He wants to
talk to me in private.

994
01:27:03,622 --> 01:27:05,817
Come, sir. Lets go.

995
01:27:06,625 --> 01:27:08,593
He's walking up the death row.

996
01:27:10,529 --> 01:27:13,089
You're completely the opposite
of what I thought you'd be.

997
01:27:13,332 --> 01:27:14,560
You're a complete gentleman.

998
01:27:15,101 --> 01:27:16,329
Wow. Nice house.

999
01:27:23,375 --> 01:27:24,501
Why is it so quiet?

1000
01:27:25,344 --> 01:27:27,710
It's the silence before the storm.

1001
01:27:31,417 --> 01:27:33,112
Afzal. Pick him up.

1002
01:27:33,185 --> 01:27:34,652
And throw him out of the village.

1003
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:42,450
This is your
sister's problem, not yours.

1004
01:27:42,628 --> 01:27:45,563
And throwing him out of the village
won't solve anything.

1005
01:27:45,631 --> 01:27:48,191
A sister can't express
her feelings to his brother.

1006
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:53,064
She would've told her mother about it,
if she was alive.

1007
01:27:53,139 --> 01:27:54,333
I've decided.

1008
01:27:55,441 --> 01:27:59,537
Every time I look at her,
I miss my mother.

1009
01:28:00,679 --> 01:28:02,237
I can never forget the day...

1010
01:28:02,815 --> 01:28:06,342
...when my father humiliated my mother.

1011
01:28:07,453 --> 01:28:09,785
She was so heart-broken that she died.

1012
01:28:11,757 --> 01:28:14,692
The rich don't value relationships.

1013
01:28:18,164 --> 01:28:21,622
I can tolerate whatever
she is going through today.

1014
01:28:22,701 --> 01:28:24,259
But I don't want her to face...

1015
01:28:24,737 --> 01:28:28,468
...the same consequences as of my mother.

1016
01:28:28,741 --> 01:28:30,470
But...

1017
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:41,119
Raghuveer.
He's come here to take his bag.

1018
01:28:41,187 --> 01:28:44,452
No, sir. I'm here for Sona.

1019
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,159
Raghuveer.

1020
01:28:49,428 --> 01:28:50,725
Raghuveer.

1021
01:28:53,065 --> 01:28:54,089
Please.

1022
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,231
Don't separate Sona and me.

1023
01:28:56,435 --> 01:28:58,494
I love her more than you do.

1024
01:28:58,671 --> 01:29:00,639
I left my parents, and everything else.

1025
01:29:00,739 --> 01:29:01,569
For her.

1026
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:05,076
Tell me,
What shall I do to prove my love?

1027
01:29:05,477 --> 01:29:07,672
Tell him to leave.

1028
01:29:07,746 --> 01:29:10,510
A person with death
penalty also gets a wish.

1029
01:29:10,583 --> 01:29:12,210
Won't you give me one chance?

1030
01:29:12,284 --> 01:29:14,514
Didn't you understand what I said?

1031
01:29:14,587 --> 01:29:17,385
What's making you so angry?

1032
01:29:17,456 --> 01:29:20,220
If your sister
reminds you of your mother.

1033
01:29:20,526 --> 01:29:23,256
Then he reminds me of you,
In your childhood.

1034
01:29:23,329 --> 01:29:26,264
Even you begged for a chance back then.

1035
01:29:27,266 --> 01:29:29,097
Have you forgotten everything?

1036
01:29:34,373 --> 01:29:38,104
Without that one chance,
you wouldn't have made it this far.

1037
01:29:38,277 --> 01:29:41,405
You can't have different
rules for yourself and others.

1038
01:29:43,215 --> 01:29:48,585
Like a fair man,
you should give him a chance.

1039
01:29:58,163 --> 01:29:59,630
Sona.

1040
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:04,794
Do you want to choose
your own life partner?

1041
01:30:05,437 --> 01:30:07,496
Or I can also have a say in it.

1042
01:30:07,773 --> 01:30:09,707
You should also agree on him.

1043
01:30:10,075 --> 01:30:13,476
Sir. How do I assure you of my love?

1044
01:30:18,517 --> 01:30:21,543
So you can do anything?
- Yes, sir.

1045
01:30:23,055 --> 01:30:25,023
You'll have to do farming.

1046
01:30:26,458 --> 01:30:28,722
I'll lend you one acre of land.

1047
01:30:30,095 --> 01:30:34,532
You'll have to grow
as much of grain as I do.

1048
01:30:35,734 --> 01:30:37,634
You will have to wash the cows.

1049
01:30:38,737 --> 01:30:40,534
Clean their dung.

1050
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:43,071
Would you be able to do that?

1051
01:30:44,143 --> 01:30:45,167
How would he do that.

1052
01:30:45,244 --> 01:30:46,711
He will have to.

1053
01:30:47,346 --> 01:30:49,473
Leaving the parents is not a big deal.

1054
01:30:49,548 --> 01:30:52,449
He'll have to toil in
the fields like a farmer.

1055
01:30:52,751 --> 01:30:56,050
The farmer, whom his
mother humiliated the other day.

1056
01:30:56,121 --> 01:30:58,715
Only then can he marry my sister.

1057
01:31:06,799 --> 01:31:08,198
I am ready sir.

1058
01:31:08,801 --> 01:31:11,497
I'll do everything you said.

1059
01:31:11,737 --> 01:31:13,068
And grow more crop than you.

1060
01:31:13,138 --> 01:31:14,730
What... what are you saying?

1061
01:31:16,108 --> 01:31:20,135
Then only he'll realise that
I love Sona more than him.

1062
01:31:20,212 --> 01:31:23,340
It's not as easy as
operating a computer.

1063
01:31:23,415 --> 01:31:25,383
It's too much of hard work.

1064
01:31:26,218 --> 01:31:28,152
Falling in love was easy, Sir.

1065
01:31:29,288 --> 01:31:33,054
But I'll work hard to prove my love.

1066
01:31:34,526 --> 01:31:36,016
And I'm ready for it.

1067
01:31:39,365 --> 01:31:43,665
And if you lose,
you'll forget my sister.

1068
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:47,534
And leave this village forever.

1069
01:31:52,578 --> 01:31:53,704
Afzal!

1070
01:31:59,251 --> 01:32:01,219
I'll wake you up at 5 in the morning.

1071
01:32:01,286 --> 01:32:02,184
Get that?

1072
01:32:02,821 --> 01:32:04,254
City bird.

1073
01:32:11,196 --> 01:32:12,322
Hi, mate.

1074
01:32:13,532 --> 01:32:14,999
New roomie.

1075
01:32:51,170 --> 01:32:53,070
I slept pretty late at night.

1076
01:32:53,138 --> 01:32:54,469
It was stinking.

1077
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:56,030
Oh! How about some tea?

1078
01:32:56,108 --> 01:32:57,632
No. Cappuccino.

1079
01:32:58,277 --> 01:33:00,745
There's your Cappachino.

1080
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:07,742
So how was the Cappachino?

1081
01:33:10,322 --> 01:33:11,186
Here.

1082
01:33:11,256 --> 01:33:13,281
Go clean the stable.

1083
01:33:20,065 --> 01:33:21,464
Holy cow! Holy cow!

1084
01:33:22,634 --> 01:33:24,261
Excuse me, ma'am.

1085
01:33:29,608 --> 01:33:31,337
Dirty fellows.

1086
01:33:36,782 --> 01:33:38,340
Hurry up!

1087
01:33:42,187 --> 01:33:44,087
You smell, man.

1088
01:33:54,566 --> 01:33:56,431
So much work man!

1089
01:34:05,277 --> 01:34:07,177
Aren't you done yet?

1090
01:34:13,352 --> 01:34:15,252
Oh no!

1091
01:34:21,994 --> 01:34:23,655
Greetings holy cow!

1092
01:34:31,136 --> 01:34:33,036
Wrong button.

1093
01:34:40,212 --> 01:34:41,338
Go. Go.

1094
01:34:51,557 --> 01:34:53,047
Where's my tractor?

1095
01:34:53,125 --> 01:34:54,353
Tractor?

1096
01:34:55,394 --> 01:34:57,294
Stop. Oh my God!

1097
01:34:57,396 --> 01:34:58,795
You crazy bulls.

1098
01:35:00,399 --> 01:35:01,457
Stop.

1099
01:35:01,533 --> 01:35:02,363
Oh my God!

1100
01:35:02,434 --> 01:35:06,336
Brother, look at this foreign farmer.

1101
01:35:06,405 --> 01:35:08,305
He won't last a day.

1102
01:35:09,074 --> 01:35:11,042
He wants a tractor.

1103
01:35:13,712 --> 01:35:15,703
Oh mummy...

1104
01:35:16,048 --> 01:35:18,039
Here. Eat it.

1105
01:35:26,458 --> 01:35:27,652
Colourful.

1106
01:35:40,572 --> 01:35:41,664
Water.

1107
01:35:41,740 --> 01:35:44,140
Come on. Take it.

1108
01:35:44,209 --> 01:35:45,301
Water.

1109
01:35:48,146 --> 01:35:48,737
Hey.

1110
01:36:23,682 --> 01:36:24,774
Listen.

1111
01:36:25,050 --> 01:36:26,574
Catch the early
train tomorrow and leave.

1112
01:36:26,652 --> 01:36:28,119
There isn't any need
to tolerate all this.

1113
01:37:46,598 --> 01:37:49,829
Will I get the same thing to eat tomorrow?
- Yes.

1114
01:37:59,177 --> 01:38:02,408
So are you taking
the morning train back?

1115
01:38:02,514 --> 01:38:04,607
Not in your dreams.

1116
01:38:45,390 --> 01:38:47,255
I'm putting you on a diet from tomorrow.

1117
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:49,786
Go on.

1118
01:39:37,609 --> 01:39:39,099
Come on, baby.

1119
01:39:40,745 --> 01:39:42,542
Let's do some farming today.

1120
01:39:42,614 --> 01:39:46,175
At first he said, "We'll discuss the marriage
proposal when my sister returns."

1121
01:39:46,418 --> 01:39:49,717
I guess, now he'll say,
"Let this boy go."

1122
01:39:50,255 --> 01:39:51,244
Why don't you ask?

1123
01:39:51,323 --> 01:39:52,620
Whats there to ask.

1124
01:39:52,691 --> 01:39:54,818
That boy's toiling hard for his love.

1125
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:58,152
He'll win the bet and Throw
you two out of the league.

1126
01:39:58,230 --> 01:40:00,460
Hey.
- Let it be.

1127
01:40:31,429 --> 01:40:32,293
Excuse me.

1128
01:40:32,364 --> 01:40:35,663
Where does Raghuveer stays?
- And, you are from?

1129
01:40:35,734 --> 01:40:37,133
Australia.

1130
01:40:41,773 --> 01:40:44,401
Anybody home?
- Who is it?

1131
01:40:46,745 --> 01:40:48,144
She's the girl.

1132
01:40:50,181 --> 01:40:54,242
So you're the one
who's hooked the gold fish.

1133
01:40:54,753 --> 01:40:57,449
I am his father.

1134
01:40:58,390 --> 01:41:00,324
What are you staring at?

1135
01:41:01,793 --> 01:41:03,818
Go. Call your brother.

1136
01:41:05,196 --> 01:41:06,220
Who is it, Sona?

1137
01:41:11,469 --> 01:41:13,061
So you're Raghuveer.

1138
01:41:14,773 --> 01:41:15,569
Yes.

1139
01:41:15,674 --> 01:41:17,141
Do you know who I am?

1140
01:41:17,208 --> 01:41:18,368
I am Ram's father.

1141
01:41:18,443 --> 01:41:20,308
So you have come here to take him back.

1142
01:41:20,378 --> 01:41:23,040
No, I'm here to congratulate you.

1143
01:41:23,114 --> 01:41:24,308
Offer you sweets.

1144
01:41:24,382 --> 01:41:26,009
How rude.

1145
01:41:26,084 --> 01:41:28,143
Is this how you welcome guests?

1146
01:41:28,353 --> 01:41:31,789
He's not getting his due respect here
because of you two.

1147
01:41:32,057 --> 01:41:34,491
I don't want to be your guest of honour.

1148
01:41:35,093 --> 01:41:37,653
Anyways, do you know what it means?

1149
01:41:38,063 --> 01:41:40,793
You made my son toil like peasants.

1150
01:41:41,066 --> 01:41:42,124
Do you know who he is?

1151
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:43,326
Tell him.

1152
01:41:43,401 --> 01:41:47,599
His father is one of the top
500 billionaires of Australia.

1153
01:41:47,639 --> 01:41:48,298
So?

1154
01:41:48,373 --> 01:41:51,274
Wait and watch,
I'm going to take him away!

1155
01:41:51,343 --> 01:41:52,640
So take him away.

1156
01:41:54,512 --> 01:41:56,707
Why did you keep him here so long?

1157
01:41:57,082 --> 01:41:58,379
We won't spare you.
- Hey!

1158
01:41:58,450 --> 01:42:00,213
Mind it.

1159
01:42:00,619 --> 01:42:03,213
That day I didn't say a word
because that was your house.

1160
01:42:03,521 --> 01:42:04,818
But this is my house.

1161
01:42:05,223 --> 01:42:06,622
If you try to raise your voice...

1162
01:42:06,725 --> 01:42:08,215
What can you do? What can you do?

1163
01:42:08,293 --> 01:42:10,090
Are you threatening us?

1164
01:42:10,128 --> 01:42:14,121
We can bribe the police to get you arrested.
- Yes.

1165
01:42:14,199 --> 01:42:18,101
You need money for that.

1166
01:42:18,403 --> 01:42:21,463
But I can kill you two right now.

1167
01:42:24,042 --> 01:42:26,738
You... will kill me?

1168
01:42:27,379 --> 01:42:29,006
You will kill me?

1169
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:29,603
Kill me.

1170
01:42:29,681 --> 01:42:31,546
Let's see. Kill me.
- Dad.

1171
01:42:44,796 --> 01:42:47,060
What have you done to yourself?

1172
01:42:47,332 --> 01:42:49,129
Why did you come here, dad?

1173
01:42:49,467 --> 01:42:52,561
Ram. He as come all
the way from Australia.

1174
01:42:52,637 --> 01:42:53,729
And you're asking him why.

1175
01:42:53,805 --> 01:42:56,069
Your condition's making me cry...

1176
01:42:56,107 --> 01:42:57,131
Quiet.

1177
01:42:59,444 --> 01:43:01,309
Let me talk to my son.

1178
01:43:01,613 --> 01:43:02,773
Leave us alone.

1179
01:43:03,148 --> 01:43:04,740
What's wrong, Ram?

1180
01:43:04,783 --> 01:43:06,148
What are you doing?

1181
01:43:06,384 --> 01:43:09,114
You're ruining your future for a girl.

1182
01:43:09,187 --> 01:43:11,451
Come. Let's go back to Australia.

1183
01:43:13,024 --> 01:43:14,116
Sorry, dad.

1184
01:43:15,593 --> 01:43:17,754
Am I not your close friend?

1185
01:43:18,229 --> 01:43:21,027
If you were my friend,
you would've helped me.

1186
01:43:21,166 --> 01:43:22,531
Well said, Ram.

1187
01:43:24,469 --> 01:43:25,265
You?

1188
01:43:25,437 --> 01:43:26,631
Why didn't you go with them?

1189
01:43:26,738 --> 01:43:29,036
Like only son, like only friend.

1190
01:43:41,653 --> 01:43:45,248
Being your father,
can I ask you something?

1191
01:43:46,458 --> 01:43:48,085
What if you lose?

1192
01:43:50,161 --> 01:43:53,187
How could you ever think that?

1193
01:43:53,231 --> 01:43:55,131
First answer my question.

1194
01:43:55,533 --> 01:43:59,629
What if you lose?
- What if you fall in the well?

1195
01:44:01,473 --> 01:44:04,499
See, I've support. I won't fall.

1196
01:44:04,576 --> 01:44:07,807
I've the support of my love.
I won't lose either.

1197
01:44:09,247 --> 01:44:11,374
Love's made you crazy.

1198
01:44:13,084 --> 01:44:16,383
Did I ever say money's made you crazy?

1199
01:44:16,621 --> 01:44:17,645
What a thought!

1200
01:44:19,157 --> 01:44:21,625
Did you get that?
- No, I didn't.

1201
01:44:21,726 --> 01:44:23,990
That's why I said,
"What was the thought"?

1202
01:44:24,362 --> 01:44:27,456
Everyone's acting wise here except me.

1203
01:44:27,532 --> 01:44:29,295
Here, eat it.

1204
01:44:36,641 --> 01:44:38,768
Stupid. What's he doing?

1205
01:44:40,612 --> 01:44:42,375
I don't get it.

1206
01:44:42,514 --> 01:44:43,776
You call this life.

1207
01:44:45,183 --> 01:44:50,348
God gifted every individual with a fate.

1208
01:44:51,122 --> 01:44:55,058
You've everything. So have fun.

1209
01:44:56,027 --> 01:44:59,485
Once it's gone,
you'll never get it back.

1210
01:44:59,764 --> 01:45:03,029
Does he understand? Is he listening?

1211
01:45:03,368 --> 01:45:05,268
I think he's listening.

1212
01:45:06,037 --> 01:45:10,303
Bijli. Some people work hard all day
and make loads of money.

1213
01:45:10,475 --> 01:45:12,409
And consider themselves fortunate.

1214
01:45:13,378 --> 01:45:14,606
But they don't know...

1215
01:45:14,679 --> 01:45:16,408
...that the greatest wealth is love.

1216
01:45:17,115 --> 01:45:20,278
And by the time they realise that,
it's too late.

1217
01:45:20,351 --> 01:45:22,478
Love. Bloody nonsense.

1218
01:45:23,054 --> 01:45:26,581
You think this is
the power of your love.

1219
01:45:26,658 --> 01:45:28,023
You think I can't do this.

1220
01:45:28,092 --> 01:45:29,320
Can't I eat this?

1221
01:45:31,162 --> 01:45:32,754
This? You want me to eat this?

1222
01:46:35,393 --> 01:46:39,227
Water?
- Water!

1223
01:46:39,731 --> 01:46:42,063
Water! Water! Water!

1224
01:46:42,333 --> 01:46:44,130
Quickly. Water!

1225
01:46:44,302 --> 01:46:47,328
Water! Water!

1226
01:46:47,672 --> 01:46:49,833
There's... no water in the car.

1227
01:46:52,543 --> 01:46:54,568
Water! Water!

1228
01:47:05,556 --> 01:47:07,319
How can you eat this?

1229
01:47:07,859 --> 01:47:10,794
It can kill anyone.

1230
01:47:12,563 --> 01:47:14,656
You're not used to eating this.

1231
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:19,636
Can you endure anything for your love?

1232
01:47:20,471 --> 01:47:23,235
Does love really give
you all this strength?

1233
01:47:23,474 --> 01:47:27,171
If it wasn't for love,
I wouldn't have come here.

1234
01:47:27,812 --> 01:47:29,473
Neither would've you come for me.

1235
01:47:33,217 --> 01:47:36,516
Pardon me. I'm not rich like you.

1236
01:47:37,355 --> 01:47:39,220
I'm just a station-master.

1237
01:47:39,390 --> 01:47:44,191
It hurts you to see
your son eat this crap.

1238
01:47:45,363 --> 01:47:47,194
But she eats this too.

1239
01:47:48,099 --> 01:47:50,067
If Ram sleeps on the floor...

1240
01:47:50,201 --> 01:47:53,637
...then so does she.

1241
01:47:54,539 --> 01:47:58,498
You must be thinking
these are old rustic values.

1242
01:47:58,710 --> 01:48:00,337
That's true.

1243
01:48:00,578 --> 01:48:02,409
But that's how she is.

1244
01:48:03,381 --> 01:48:07,545
And every day she prays in
the temple for his victory.

1245
01:48:18,096 --> 01:48:20,428
Don't ever let that
lamp extinguish, dear.

1246
01:48:21,232 --> 01:48:25,066
My son's led a life
of luxury and comfort.

1247
01:48:26,270 --> 01:48:29,706
He's never done anything all his life.

1248
01:48:30,174 --> 01:48:34,201
Seeing him toil here made me go crazy.

1249
01:48:35,079 --> 01:48:37,809
Your love has shown me and my son...

1250
01:48:38,216 --> 01:48:40,514
...the value of this soil.

1251
01:48:41,486 --> 01:48:42,475
God bless you.

1252
01:48:46,591 --> 01:48:47,785
God bless you, dear.

1253
01:48:48,393 --> 01:48:50,418
Your decision's wrong, brother-in-law.

1254
01:48:50,595 --> 01:48:52,358
My sister will never agree.

1255
01:48:52,530 --> 01:48:55,090
In fact, it can create problems
between you two.

1256
01:48:55,533 --> 01:48:56,625
Yes.

1257
01:48:56,701 --> 01:48:58,134
It can make things worse.

1258
01:48:58,369 --> 01:49:02,305
I don't want any problem between two of you because of
me.
- Yes.

1259
01:49:02,373 --> 01:49:03,670
Don't worry.

1260
01:49:04,275 --> 01:49:07,073
I know my wife's weaknesses.

1261
01:49:07,245 --> 01:49:09,645
She always listens to useless
and good-for-nothing people.

1262
01:49:10,181 --> 01:49:11,546
I'm returning home today.

1263
01:49:12,183 --> 01:49:14,378
I know how to make my wife understand.

1264
01:49:14,585 --> 01:49:15,517
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1265
01:49:15,586 --> 01:49:16,518
Excuse me.

1266
01:49:20,291 --> 01:49:21,121
I tried my best.

1267
01:49:21,225 --> 01:49:21,714
Take a look.

1268
01:49:21,793 --> 01:49:23,260
Take a look at my daughter's condition.

1269
01:49:23,294 --> 01:49:24,625
What's going to happen to her now?

1270
01:49:24,695 --> 01:49:26,322
Stop it, JP. Stop it.

1271
01:49:26,664 --> 01:49:28,655
My sister won't agree so easily.

1272
01:49:29,367 --> 01:49:31,028
Look. Your only concern is...

1273
01:49:31,102 --> 01:49:33,570
...that Ram might marry that girl.

1274
01:49:34,338 --> 01:49:37,273
But he'll have to win
the challenge for that.

1275
01:49:37,341 --> 01:49:37,807
Yes.

1276
01:49:38,076 --> 01:49:40,135
And Raghuveer doesn't want Ram to win.

1277
01:49:40,578 --> 01:49:42,239
Ram will definitely lose.

1278
01:49:43,081 --> 01:49:44,776
Say that again.

1279
01:49:45,283 --> 01:49:47,683
Ram will definitely lose! 100%.

1280
01:51:29,554 --> 01:51:31,249
There's crop in everyone's fields.

1281
01:51:32,456 --> 01:51:34,117
But, nothing in mine.

1282
01:51:55,246 --> 01:51:57,806
Yeah! There's crop in my field too.

1283
01:53:36,347 --> 01:53:38,406
Please. Give that back.

1284
01:54:31,469 --> 01:54:32,231
Hello.

1285
01:54:32,303 --> 01:54:33,998
The situation's getting worse.

1286
01:54:34,071 --> 01:54:36,562
That girl won't let go of Ram easily.

1287
01:54:36,674 --> 01:54:38,471
I think we'll lose Ram.

1288
01:54:38,542 --> 01:54:40,737
I am holding on to your promise

1289
01:54:41,078 --> 01:54:43,444
I always keep my promise.

1290
01:54:43,614 --> 01:54:45,081
The same will happen this time too.

1291
01:54:45,149 --> 01:54:46,548
What do I do now?

1292
01:54:46,617 --> 01:54:50,075
No need to tell me what you do.

1293
01:54:50,554 --> 01:54:53,421
But she shouldn't
become my daughter-in-law.

1294
01:54:53,491 --> 01:54:55,789
You wait and watch now.

1295
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:59,488
They won't know what hit them.

1296
01:55:12,443 --> 01:55:15,276
Who are you?

1297
01:55:17,481 --> 01:55:19,574
It's me?
- You?

1298
01:55:20,050 --> 01:55:22,348
What are you doing here?
- Making a canal.

1299
01:55:22,586 --> 01:55:24,554
Canal? Why?

1300
01:55:25,489 --> 01:55:27,980
To save the fields from rain.

1301
01:55:28,058 --> 01:55:32,154
It won't rain. Just leave.

1302
01:55:34,064 --> 01:55:36,191
I think it's going to rain.

1303
01:55:36,467 --> 01:55:40,062
You fool.
I've been farming here for years.

1304
01:55:40,237 --> 01:55:42,296
And you're going to teach me about rain.

1305
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:44,235
These are just storm clouds.

1306
01:55:44,308 --> 01:55:46,469
It's not going to rain...

1307
01:55:59,523 --> 01:56:00,285
Afzal!

1308
01:56:00,357 --> 01:56:02,052
Don't worry, sir.

1309
01:56:02,359 --> 01:56:05,385
I already made a canal in your field.

1310
01:56:07,765 --> 01:56:09,130
You're getting drenched.

1311
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:11,195
I'll handle things here.

1312
01:56:21,779 --> 01:56:23,076
Raghu!

1313
01:56:23,647 --> 01:56:25,740
Raghu! Raghu!

1314
01:56:26,283 --> 01:56:27,614
Why are you sleeping here?

1315
01:56:30,387 --> 01:56:33,720
What's wrong?
- I was missing mom.

1316
01:56:34,391 --> 01:56:36,655
Sir, I was thinking...
- Stop thinking.

1317
01:56:36,794 --> 01:56:39,092
I've good news for you.

1318
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:41,491
Sona's scored first class in her exams.

1319
01:56:41,599 --> 01:56:43,430
Yes, first class.

1320
01:56:44,335 --> 01:56:45,529
Sona.

1321
01:56:48,072 --> 01:56:49,505
Take sir's blessings.

1322
01:56:50,508 --> 01:56:52,533
Always be successful.

1323
01:56:52,710 --> 01:56:55,577
Marry the one you love.

1324
01:56:55,746 --> 01:56:58,180
And lead a happy life.

1325
01:57:01,485 --> 01:57:02,713
I didn't say that deliberately.

1326
01:57:02,786 --> 01:57:03,844
It just came out.

1327
01:57:05,422 --> 01:57:07,356
What are you looking at?

1328
01:57:07,791 --> 01:57:11,454
I would've gifted Sona the station,
if she was my daughter.

1329
01:57:11,529 --> 01:57:12,427
What are you giving her?

1330
01:57:12,496 --> 01:57:14,691
Go ahead, Sona.

1331
01:57:15,199 --> 01:57:16,325
Ask for anything you want.

1332
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:17,560
Bangles. Earrings.

1333
01:57:17,735 --> 01:57:19,066
Go ahead.

1334
01:57:19,603 --> 01:57:20,661
Go.

1335
01:57:23,474 --> 01:57:25,567
Ask away, Sona. What do you want?

1336
01:57:26,243 --> 01:57:28,643
Can we arrange a feast
for the villagers?

1337
01:57:29,079 --> 01:57:31,377
Of course, invite everyone.

1338
01:57:32,149 --> 01:57:33,173
Brother.

1339
01:57:34,818 --> 01:57:36,513
Ram is in the village too.

1340
01:57:37,721 --> 01:57:39,245
Can he come?

1341
01:57:41,659 --> 01:57:45,618
Fine, Since we're inviting everyone,
invite him too.

1342
01:57:48,232 --> 01:57:51,668
He's agreed but only after hesitation.

1343
01:57:52,069 --> 01:57:54,264
But careful.

1344
01:58:12,556 --> 01:58:13,784
Your brother's coming.

1345
01:58:24,401 --> 01:58:25,732
Can I get two more?

1346
01:58:29,540 --> 01:58:31,167
Just two?

1347
01:58:38,816 --> 01:58:42,115
Someone tie the bull.

1348
01:58:42,186 --> 01:58:44,245
He's overeaten.

1349
01:58:44,722 --> 01:58:46,349
You're mistaken.

1350
01:58:46,423 --> 01:58:49,415
That was me belching, not that bull.

1351
01:58:49,593 --> 01:58:51,424
You're mistaken too.

1352
01:58:51,495 --> 01:58:54,464
He meant you, not the bull.
- Quiet.

1353
01:58:54,498 --> 01:58:55,465
Quiet.

1354
01:58:55,633 --> 01:58:56,565
Don't act smart.

1355
01:58:56,634 --> 01:58:57,794
And careful...

1356
01:59:05,142 --> 01:59:07,133
Thank you.
- What for?

1357
01:59:07,211 --> 01:59:09,645
You invited the entire village...

1358
01:59:09,847 --> 01:59:11,678
...so I get to eat good food.

1359
01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:19,783
The other day I ate that
spicy food and you gave me bonus.

1360
01:59:20,357 --> 01:59:22,188
Today, you've excelled in your exams...

1361
01:59:22,593 --> 01:59:23,685
...and all I get is food?

1362
01:59:25,629 --> 01:59:26,653
No bonus.

1363
01:59:26,730 --> 01:59:30,131
Everyone,
on the occasion of Sona's achievement...

1364
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:32,361
...everyone will get a bonus from me.

1365
01:59:33,704 --> 01:59:35,399
A box of sweets.

1366
01:59:45,082 --> 01:59:47,448
I've realised how much you love Sona.

1367
01:59:50,554 --> 01:59:52,784
No one can love her more than you.

1368
01:59:59,496 --> 02:00:00,656
Sona.

1369
02:00:01,632 --> 02:00:04,226
Sona. Come quickly.

1370
02:00:15,746 --> 02:00:17,043
Let go.

1371
02:00:17,414 --> 02:00:18,403
Brother!

1372
02:00:18,482 --> 02:00:20,040
Let go of me.

1373
02:00:29,059 --> 02:00:30,185
Get lost.

1374
02:01:03,694 --> 02:01:05,059
Hello.

1375
02:01:05,229 --> 02:01:06,594
My name is Rao.

1376
02:01:06,730 --> 02:01:09,096
People are terrified of me.

1377
02:01:09,166 --> 02:01:10,394
I know.

1378
02:01:11,068 --> 02:01:12,399
Who is the target?

1379
02:01:13,670 --> 02:01:15,001
He's the right man.

1380
02:01:15,305 --> 02:01:17,603
Straight to the point.

1381
02:01:22,179 --> 02:01:23,476
Keep this.

1382
02:01:23,747 --> 02:01:25,339
I'll tell you the job later.

1383
02:01:30,053 --> 02:01:33,682
I'll destroy the entire crop.

1384
02:01:34,324 --> 02:01:36,292
Mix it.

1385
02:01:36,460 --> 02:01:37,722
Mix it. Mix it.

1386
02:01:38,028 --> 02:01:41,759
Boss. This is a new fertilizer.

1387
02:01:43,167 --> 02:01:45,795
One litre will turn
the fields lush green.

1388
02:01:46,069 --> 02:01:50,028
And two litres
will make it barren like a desert.

1389
02:01:51,375 --> 02:01:54,276
Add three.
- Fine, boss.

1390
02:01:55,045 --> 02:01:58,037
Look, boss.
- Pour it.

1391
02:02:05,756 --> 02:02:07,087
Let's go.

1392
02:02:08,192 --> 02:02:10,752
Run. Quickly.

1393
02:02:16,567 --> 02:02:18,330
Who is that?

1394
02:02:19,102 --> 02:02:20,592
Boss.
- Yes.

1395
02:02:21,004 --> 02:02:22,301
I don't know.

1396
02:02:27,177 --> 02:02:29,304
Double action.

1397
02:02:29,580 --> 02:02:31,571
Same to same.

1398
02:02:42,025 --> 02:02:43,322
What's he doing?

1399
02:02:56,173 --> 02:02:57,663
What's wrong with you all?

1400
02:02:58,375 --> 02:03:00,434
Why is everyone making a ruckus?

1401
02:04:12,015 --> 02:04:13,448
Oh, God!

1402
02:04:13,517 --> 02:04:17,715
Fire! Fire! Fire!

1403
02:04:18,989 --> 02:04:19,546
Brother, fire.

1404
02:04:19,623 --> 02:04:22,319
Afzal.
- Brother, fire!

1405
02:04:22,392 --> 02:04:24,155
Afzal.
- Yes, brother.

1406
02:04:24,294 --> 02:04:25,591
Come to your senses.

1407
02:04:25,662 --> 02:04:28,130
Throw water. Quickly!

1408
02:04:34,338 --> 02:04:35,464
Come on.

1409
02:04:42,579 --> 02:04:44,046
Careful.

1410
02:04:54,157 --> 02:04:55,488
Come on.

1411
02:05:00,330 --> 02:05:01,262
How did this happen?

1412
02:05:01,331 --> 02:05:02,798
Hurry up, Sona.

1413
02:05:08,372 --> 02:05:10,397
Hurry up.

1414
02:05:15,579 --> 02:05:17,444
Ram!

1415
02:05:19,583 --> 02:05:20,675
No, Sona.

1416
02:05:20,751 --> 02:05:22,082
No, Sona.

1417
02:05:22,152 --> 02:05:24,313
Sona. Stop.

1418
02:05:24,388 --> 02:05:26,515
Ram.
- Stop, I...

1419
02:05:39,669 --> 02:05:42,229
Are you crazy?

1420
02:05:42,439 --> 02:05:44,100
What if something
Would've happened to you?

1421
02:05:44,508 --> 02:05:46,476
What?

1422
02:05:46,743 --> 02:05:48,711
What's in the box?

1423
02:06:44,534 --> 02:06:45,660
Brilliant! You did the right thing.

1424
02:06:45,735 --> 02:06:47,794
Destroyed me completely.

1425
02:06:48,171 --> 02:06:49,604
What are you thinking now?

1426
02:06:50,707 --> 02:06:54,643
Who was that guy in specs,
I saw in the field?

1427
02:06:55,545 --> 02:06:56,705
You can keep thinking.

1428
02:06:56,780 --> 02:06:59,578
I'll find someone else to do my job.

1429
02:07:00,150 --> 02:07:03,381
Your idea to ruin the crops was wrong.

1430
02:07:03,620 --> 02:07:05,485
Give me another chance.

1431
02:07:05,555 --> 02:07:07,523
If I fail this time you can...

1432
02:07:07,591 --> 02:07:10,116
Clobber me with your shoe.

1433
02:07:10,193 --> 02:07:12,593
I've a plan.
- You do?

1434
02:07:12,662 --> 02:07:13,686
Then it must be good.

1435
02:07:14,064 --> 02:07:15,725
Go ahead. Do it.

1436
02:07:30,180 --> 02:07:31,670
Sona.

1437
02:07:32,749 --> 02:07:34,239
Sona.

1438
02:07:37,821 --> 02:07:40,312
The crops will be harvested tomorrow.

1439
02:07:41,424 --> 02:07:43,585
That will decide our future.

1440
02:07:45,529 --> 02:07:47,190
Are you worried?

1441
02:07:50,433 --> 02:07:52,458
I feel something-something too.

1442
02:07:52,836 --> 02:07:55,805
In a fit of rage I said
I'll grow more crop than you.

1443
02:07:57,641 --> 02:07:59,541
I was a little overconfident, right?

1444
02:08:01,478 --> 02:08:02,604
A bit.

1445
02:08:02,679 --> 02:08:04,613
Your brother's a nice man.

1446
02:08:04,814 --> 02:08:08,580
Ask him not to throw me out if I fail.

1447
02:08:09,686 --> 02:08:11,654
I'll work like a peasant.

1448
02:08:13,590 --> 02:08:15,524
I cannot leave this village.

1449
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:17,720
The bulls and goats.

1450
02:08:18,061 --> 02:08:19,028
The fields.

1451
02:08:19,196 --> 02:08:21,061
Your brother's sharp look.

1452
02:08:21,431 --> 02:08:25,390
I never imagined this,
but I can't live without these anymore.

1453
02:08:34,544 --> 02:08:37,536
This is Ram's pile.

1454
02:08:37,714 --> 02:08:43,175
Let's move some of
it in Raghuveer's pile.

1455
02:08:43,453 --> 02:08:46,286
Then Ram cannot win.

1456
02:08:47,257 --> 02:08:51,353
Boss, you're intelligent like don 2?

1457
02:08:51,828 --> 02:08:53,523
Are you buttering me?

1458
02:08:55,098 --> 02:08:56,190
Get to work?

1459
02:08:59,169 --> 02:09:00,363
Fool.

1460
02:09:13,250 --> 02:09:16,242
These bloody mosquitoes...

1461
02:09:31,735 --> 02:09:38,038
I forgot to feed the cows again.

1462
02:09:53,523 --> 02:09:55,184
Boss, you burnt your
back the other day...

1463
02:09:55,358 --> 02:09:56,757
...today, you got peed on your face.

1464
02:09:56,826 --> 02:09:59,124
What's happening with you, boss?

1465
02:09:59,195 --> 02:10:00,423
Did you finish the job?

1466
02:10:00,664 --> 02:10:04,532
Yes, I'm done.
- Was that ajoke?

1467
02:10:06,836 --> 02:10:07,734
Get back to work.

1468
02:10:10,607 --> 02:10:14,373
You are so dead, Ram.

1469
02:10:24,087 --> 02:10:28,114
Why is everyone rushing there,
shouldn't we be in a hurry instead.

1470
02:10:28,391 --> 02:10:31,019
Everyone wants the boy to win.

1471
02:10:33,496 --> 02:10:35,327
Let's go.

1472
02:11:03,126 --> 02:11:06,721
One!

1473
02:11:11,101 --> 02:11:15,128
Three!

1474
02:11:16,473 --> 02:11:19,135
Five!

1475
02:11:26,750 --> 02:11:29,344
What are you doing here?

1476
02:11:29,552 --> 02:11:31,383
Praying for your victory?

1477
02:11:31,454 --> 02:11:33,786
The offering in Ram's name is done.

1478
02:11:34,090 --> 02:11:36,081
Ram?
- Here's the coconut.

1479
02:11:47,036 --> 02:11:48,594
I'm really happy.

1480
02:11:49,406 --> 02:11:52,273
I don't know whether he wins or not.

1481
02:11:52,342 --> 02:11:56,472
But he's definitely won your heart.
- No.

1482
02:11:56,780 --> 02:11:58,304
He'll have to win the bet too.

1483
02:11:58,381 --> 02:11:59,678
You're still adamant.

1484
02:12:00,150 --> 02:12:03,517
If he loses,
won't you get them married?

1485
02:12:06,356 --> 02:12:07,721
He won't lose.

1486
02:12:09,826 --> 02:12:14,422
He put his life at
stake for my sister's toy.

1487
02:12:15,265 --> 02:12:19,599
My mother will never
forgive me if he loses.

1488
02:12:21,738 --> 02:12:24,172
I saw his pile in the morning.

1489
02:12:24,507 --> 02:12:26,634
It seemed a bit less.

1490
02:12:27,210 --> 02:12:31,613
So I added some of
my harvest to his pile.

1491
02:12:35,151 --> 02:12:37,449
When you were a kid,
I bet on your honesty.

1492
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:40,314
Today I won.

1493
02:12:40,657 --> 02:12:42,386
Break the coconut.

1494
02:12:57,540 --> 02:13:00,703
We won, Sona!

1495
02:13:00,777 --> 02:13:03,541
We won.
- Rascal. Come on.

1496
02:13:07,684 --> 02:13:09,777
How will I face my daughter now?

1497
02:13:10,053 --> 02:13:11,714
What will I say to Ram's mom?

1498
02:13:12,188 --> 02:13:16,181
Your stupid plan has ruined me.

1499
02:13:21,397 --> 02:13:24,298
Now... I'll finish this job.

1500
02:13:26,002 --> 02:13:29,062
You handle the police.

1501
02:13:38,014 --> 02:13:40,744
Sona!

1502
02:13:41,284 --> 02:13:44,685
We won, Sona!

1503
02:13:45,788 --> 02:13:48,018
I managed to grow two sacks more!

1504
02:13:48,091 --> 02:13:49,422
Two sacks!

1505
02:14:02,572 --> 02:14:04,199
Get in! Get in!

1506
02:14:13,983 --> 02:14:15,450
Ram!

1507
02:14:45,181 --> 02:14:46,113
Ram!

1508
02:14:47,350 --> 02:14:48,317
Ram!

1509
02:14:51,220 --> 02:14:52,244
Ram!

1510
02:14:55,091 --> 02:14:58,151
Brother.

1511
02:14:58,528 --> 02:15:00,223
Sona.

1512
02:15:26,723 --> 02:15:28,054
Go on.

1513
02:15:33,062 --> 02:15:36,031
I proposed for your marriage with my son.

1514
02:15:36,099 --> 02:15:37,157
But your brother never replied.

1515
02:15:37,367 --> 02:15:41,201
Now... I will get this marriage done.

1516
02:15:41,337 --> 02:15:42,736
Come on son.

1517
02:15:45,541 --> 02:15:47,600
Tie the nuptial necklace.

1518
02:15:47,644 --> 02:15:50,374
We'll see how she won't marry you.

1519
02:16:04,727 --> 02:16:06,126
Get lost!

1520
02:16:06,195 --> 02:16:09,323
If you marry her.
Her brother will kill you.

1521
02:16:09,399 --> 02:16:11,458
He can't.

1522
02:16:11,668 --> 02:16:14,694
He can never come here.
- Why not?

1523
02:16:15,338 --> 02:16:17,238
I came here, right?

1524
02:16:17,407 --> 02:16:19,136
He'll come too.

1525
02:16:20,176 --> 02:16:20,801
Look.

1526
02:16:21,144 --> 02:16:21,803
Look, he's here.

1527
02:16:22,779 --> 02:16:23,643
Sona, run.

1528
02:16:23,713 --> 02:16:24,702
Catch her.

1529
02:16:28,217 --> 02:16:29,241
Come on, Sona.

1530
02:16:31,788 --> 02:16:33,813
This way. Come on.

1531
02:16:36,225 --> 02:16:38,125
That way. Go that way.

1532
02:16:39,762 --> 02:16:41,593
Sit here.

1533
02:16:41,831 --> 02:16:43,696
Don't make a sound.

1534
02:16:58,414 --> 02:16:59,472
Stop.

1535
02:16:59,549 --> 02:17:01,380
There she is.

1536
02:17:03,653 --> 02:17:05,587
Where is she?
Where is she hiding?

1537
02:17:07,290 --> 02:17:09,485
Tell me.
- Sir

1538
02:17:14,564 --> 02:17:16,498
You dare spit on me!

1539
02:17:49,599 --> 02:17:52,090
Stop. Come here.

1540
02:18:00,743 --> 02:18:02,335
Leave me!

1541
02:18:09,318 --> 02:18:10,250
Faster.

1542
02:18:10,787 --> 02:18:12,015
Run over them.

1543
02:18:12,188 --> 02:18:13,382
Run over both of them.

1544
02:18:52,228 --> 02:18:53,126
Sorry! Sorry!

1545
02:19:00,069 --> 02:19:02,196
Brother.

1546
02:19:03,072 --> 02:19:04,300
Hold him!

1547
02:19:04,407 --> 02:19:06,068
I will...

1548
02:19:07,410 --> 02:19:08,399
Brother!

1549
02:19:16,586 --> 02:19:17,575
Brother!

1550
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:18,678
Hey!

1551
02:20:31,460 --> 02:20:35,226
So, you took the blame on yourself.

1552
02:20:40,403 --> 02:20:43,497
Your sister is fortunate
to have a brother like you.

1553
02:20:43,639 --> 02:20:45,300
A new dawn awaits you.

1554
02:20:45,341 --> 02:20:46,535
Get some sleep.

1555
02:21:20,409 --> 02:21:25,278
You're lucky...
to have a sister like Sona.

1556
02:21:26,082 --> 02:21:28,175
They didn't get married...

1557
02:21:28,351 --> 02:21:30,182
...as there wasn't an auspicious day.

1558
02:21:30,419 --> 02:21:32,148
There can't be a better day...

1559
02:21:32,188 --> 02:21:33,655
...than the day of your release.

1560
02:21:58,714 --> 02:22:00,545
I didn't ask her to come.

1561
02:22:01,350 --> 02:22:03,716
Ashwini came here willingly.
