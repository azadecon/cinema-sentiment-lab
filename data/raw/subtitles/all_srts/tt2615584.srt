1
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,700
Please. Please. - Get lost. Go on.

2
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,450
Constable.

3
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,790
Here's Rs. 100. - What for?

4
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,250
I ran a red light yesterday.

5
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,700
A woman was pregnant. I had to rush her to the hospital.

6
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,120
This is the fine for breaking the signal.

7
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,200
Wow, Savitribai.

8
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,200
If everyone can be as honest as you..

9
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,500
..there will be no need for us.

10
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,950
Okay, Jai Hind.

11
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,080
Hey. Where's the receipt?

12
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh! I completely forgot.

13
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,000
Here's your receipt.

14
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,080
How's your son? Where is he?

15
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,330
He is fine. He's studying in school now.

16
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,500
When he grows up I'll make him a police officer.

17
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,040
I see, you mean like us.

18
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,660
I'll make him an honest police officer.

19
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,000
Jai Hind.

20
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,040
Children. This is India.

21
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,660
In the North are the Himalayas.

22
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,790
And in the South is the Indian Ocean.

23
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,120
Vishwas.

24
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,790
Vishwas! - Yes, sir.

25
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,910
What's in the South of India? - Rajnikant.

26
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,410
Quiet!

27
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,250
And what's. What's that in your hands? - Nothing.

28
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,450
Nothing. - Show me.

29
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,000
So this is what you read in class?

30
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,910
Film magazines! - Sir, this belongs to Gopi not me.

31
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,620
Gopi.. - No, sir. He asked me to get it.

32
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,540
Sir, he did.. - No, sir, it was him.. - Quiet!

33
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,830
You don't have a father.

34
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,330
Your mother works hard all day..

35
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,750
..to pay for your education..

36
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:01,910
..so that you can become someone successful.

37
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,830
I want to be successful like someone, sir. - Like whom?

38
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,290
Shahrukh Khan? Salman Khan? Amir Khan?

39
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,620
No, sir. Why would I be successful like them?

40
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,410
I am Rao. Vishwas Rao.

41
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,910
Hero Vishwas Rao.

42
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,250
What did you study in school today?

43
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,080
Don't ask about the study. I'm tired of studying all day.

44
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,450
I see. Here. I've brought dry-fruits for you.

45
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,790
Mom. Let me drive for a while.

46
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,000
No. Not yet.

47
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,080
Only after you turn 18 and get a license..

48
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,330
..you can drive then.

49
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,620
Come on, mom. Let me drive for a while.

50
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,200
No one's watching anyway.

51
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,450
Get down!

52
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,950
Don't ever say that again.

53
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,580
I'm watching, God's watching.

54
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,450
So never do anything wrong.

55
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,910
Do you get that? - Yes.

56
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,290
No, you didn't.

57
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,450
I'll explain to you.

58
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:01,330
Stand in front of all the trees here and say..

59
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:07,120
"I swear on you, my mother and God.."

60
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,750
"..that I will never do anything wrong."

61
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,620
Go on.

62
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,620
Go.

63
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,830
Say it.

64
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:26,660
I swear on you, my mother and God..

65
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,080
..that I will never do anything wrong.

66
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,080
"I'll become an honest police officer."

67
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,830
I'll become an honest police officer.

68
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,830
Bravo.

69
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,080
In future he'll be a police officer.

70
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,410
I want you to train him..

71
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:54,790
..so that he can beat-up the bad guys.

72
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,910
Definitely, sister. He will beat them all up.

73
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,950
I will train him so well..

74
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,540
..that he'll beat up 10 bad guys at a time.

75
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,330
That's it, only 10?

76
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,500
And..

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,370
You're going to become a police officer? - Yes, Gopi. I am.

78
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,330
I will be a police officer.

79
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,250
I'll be a Don.

80
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,540
I'll be a judge. I'll be a doctor.

81
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,290
I'll be an engineer too.

82
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,330
But how can you be all that?

83
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,330
Because I'll be a movie-star.

84
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,910
Help! - Wait.

85
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,910
Help!

86
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,160
Hey Vishu.

87
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,450
Hey!

88
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,620
Who are you?

89
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,120
I just showed a little style, a little attitude..

90
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,330
..and you're already scared.

91
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,790
The hero's just made his entry.

92
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,790
Wait and watch what happens next.

93
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,000
Thrash him. - Hey morons.

94
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,250
If you have the guts...then..

95
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,290
..don't come one-by-one.

96
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,450
Come together.

97
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,750
I'm in a hurry.

98
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,750
Start!

99
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,750
Through the poster, emerges the hero.

100
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,290
Fantastic dialogues.

101
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,830
Terrific fighting.

102
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,540
Just like a hero. - That's what I want to be, Gopi.

103
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,160
Just wait and watch. Soon you'll see huge posters of me.

104
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,500
Did you hear, aunt? - No, mom.

105
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,750
Hero?

106
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,370
Go on. Your mother will definitely make you a police officer.

107
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,040
Tomorrow is your entrance exam.

108
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,040
Go and prepare.

109
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,410
Vishwas Rao!

110
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,660
May I come in, sir? - Come in.

111
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,660
Thank you, sir.

112
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,910
Sir!

113
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,620
Are you unwell? - No, sir.

114
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,620
You see, sir...I get breathless soon.

115
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,330
But nothing to worry about, sir.

116
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,540
It's been like this since childhood.

117
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,790
Sir!

118
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,370
Did you hurt your leg? - No, sir.

119
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,330
You see...I've one short leg.

120
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,250
But nothing to worry about, sir.

121
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,660
It's been like this since childhood.

122
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,040
And yet you want to join the police force? - Yes, sir.

123
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,120
I want to join the police force and serve the country.

124
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,120
That's been my childhood dream.

125
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,330
Sir! - Fine.

126
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,330
Let's check your eyes. - Yes, sir.

127
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,000
Read the first letter.

128
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,330
Which letter sir?

129
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,830
First letter. It's up there.

130
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,950
Up where, sir?

131
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,200
Up on the chart.

132
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,950
What chart, sir?

133
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,200
The chart that's on the stand. - What stand, sir?

134
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,200
Impossible!

135
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,080
What was that? - Nothing, sir. - What was that?

136
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:27,330
Sometimes I...check it like this.

137
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,540
Y.

138
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,910
The first letter is Y.

139
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:35,200
Rejected. - Selected! Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.

140
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,080
Sir!

141
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,160
So you've a hearing problem as well.

142
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,790
Sometimes, sir. - But nothing to worry about, sir.

143
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:46,080
It's been like this since childhood.

144
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,330
Get out!

145
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,370
Get out! Get out!

146
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,830
Out! Out! Out!

147
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,500
Out!

148
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,500
Out!

149
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,580
Sir!

150
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,790
Take down my telephone number. Please.

151
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,500
If my country ever needs me..

152
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,660
..I'm always at service.

153
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,450
You get exhausted even while talking.

154
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,830
You can't walk few steps properly.

155
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,290
You can't see or hear properly.

156
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,160
What good are you to the country?

157
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,290
I think you're angry right now?

158
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,950
I'll come later and explain to you.

159
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,910
What time do I come, sir?

160
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,200
Why you..

161
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,330
Get lost!

162
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,410
Get lost!

163
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,410
Get lost!

164
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,330
I still don't understand..

165
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,700
..why you always fail the police entrance test.

166
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,580
Forget it, mom. These policemen are not too smart.

167
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,910
What?

168
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,410
See what's written here? - What?

169
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:07,040
It says here "Terrorists attack a group of policemen".

170
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,410
"12 policemen dead."

171
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,450
"Three of them were new recruits."

172
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,870
They were just my age. Did you hear?

173
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,410
What if I had died like this?

174
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,660
Then, what about you?

175
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,250
No, mom. I don't want to make you upset..

176
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,120
..by joining the police.

177
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,200
I would've felt proud, instead of being upset. - I see.

178
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,160
You didn't read this other news.

179
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,660
It's written here..

180
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,000
"Dacoits shot a police officer's mother dead."

181
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,330
Did you hear?

182
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,870
They shot the mother.

183
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,330
No, mom. I can't put your life in danger.

184
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,580
I will never join the police force, that's it.

185
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,160
What did you say?

186
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,290
How dare you? - Mom.

187
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,830
Listen to me, mom. - Stop. Stop I say.

188
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,410
Mom.. - Stop.

189
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,700
I'm going. - I'll teach you a lesson..

190
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,700
I'll show you when you come back in the evening.

191
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:19,500
"All I want is you, forever, mom."

192
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,500
"I want you to be my earth and sky, forever, mom."

193
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,910
"All I want is you, forever, mom."

194
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:42,500
"I want you to be my earth and sky, forever, mom."

195
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,540
"I know...that Lord dwells in our heart."

196
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,250
"But...my sweet-innocent mom dwells in my heart."

197
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,250
"But...my sweet-innocent mom dwells in my heart."

198
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,540
"The world's crazy."

199
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:24,370
"They go to temples and shrines to cajole the Lord."

200
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:35,830
"My shrine's in my home, whenever I look at mom."

201
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:44,200
"Whenever I look at mom."

202
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:50,160
"You're the only one I pray for forever, mom."

203
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:57,290
"You're the only feeling I want forever, mom."

204
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,540
Stop. Stop. Stop.

205
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,750
Congratulation.

206
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,250
This is the reply to the application..

207
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,200
..that we sent to the police department.

208
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,540
Vishwas has been called to Mumbai for an interview.

209
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,080
Mumbai? - You just hit the jackpot, Vishu.

210
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,250
What jackpot, Gopi?

211
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,870
Mom's sending me for the police selection.

212
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,080
I know she is.

213
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,660
She always refused earlier.

214
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,040
Now you can go to Mumbai. Be a star.

215
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,870
"Yeah right. Go. Be a star."

216
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,120
As if every director's waiting for my arrival.

217
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,290
Didn't I tell you?

218
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,290
The girl you saved at the cinema hall..

219
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,500
..has a distant uncle. Yogi.

220
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,120
He's a renowned writer.

221
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,580
He knows every producer/director in the industry.

222
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,660
He will get you a break in acting.

223
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,660
Really? - Yes.

224
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,910
Traitor, why did you go meet our enemy..

225
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,660
..Jt. Commissioner Khare?

226
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,580
And what did you tell him? Speak up.

227
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,450
He was saying, something despicable..

228
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,160
..is about to happen in the city..

229
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,620
..by the name of 'Mission White Elephant'.

230
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,410
While Elephant.

231
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,790
What is that?

232
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,040
And.. - And?

233
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,040
He wanted to know when Napoleon sir is arriving.

234
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,370
RDX. - Yes, sir.

235
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,370
Take him along, and practice target on him.

236
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,830
Jt. Commissioner Khare..

237
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,750
..has got a whiff of our mission.

238
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,950
And about Napoleon, sir.

239
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,950
Now there will be war.

240
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,450
What do I do, Lord?

241
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,040
What do I do?

242
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,830
After making me blind, You've turned deaf.

243
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,450
I haven't eaten for three days.

244
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,500
I don't even have the money to buy poison.

245
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,660
Now You've to help me in taking my life.

246
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,700
No, mister. Don't lose hope so soon.

247
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,700
I've some money. Here you go.

248
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,660
Keep it. To buy poison.. - Huh!

249
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,750
I mean to buy food.

250
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,250
Did you really think I was blind?

251
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,500
Sorry. - That's okay.

252
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,870
I'm an actor. And this is my first earning.

253
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,160
I am Istiyaq. And you? - Vishwas.

254
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,540
I'm here to see Yogi bhai.

255
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,410
How did you know I'm here to become an actor?

256
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,620
People come with the same dreams to Sapna Guest House.

257
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,160
But do their dreams get fulfilled?

258
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,370
Will I get a role?

259
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:06,660
All one gets are dates, dates, dates and more dates.

260
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,450
But no roles.

261
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,660
That's Vishwanath.

262
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,870
He's rehearsing.

263
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,250
Tomorrow's his date.

264
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,080
I mean audition.

265
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,580
Who is he, Istiyaq? - He's one of us.

266
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,250
I see. Another aspiring actor.

267
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,450
Vishwas.

268
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:23,450
Vishwanath.

269
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,910
Guruji.

270
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:34,200
Guruji.

271
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,120
I think he's sleeping.

272
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,580
No, he's thinking.

273
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,000
He's a renowned writer.

274
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,540
Let's go. - Yes.

275
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,540
Who is it?

276
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,410
Some Vishwas is here to see you.

277
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,410
Hello, sir.

278
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,830
Vishwas. Come.

279
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,290
Gopi informed me that you're coming.

280
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,580
Now that you've come to me..

281
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,660
..you'll definitely be successful. - Thank you.

282
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,660
By the way, what films have you written?

283
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,370
Have you seen 'Ghajini'? - I have.

284
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,660
'Gadar'? - I saw it twice, sir.

285
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,080
'Dhoom'? - 'Dhoom' was a blast. I did.

286
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,250
'Wanted?' - I saw it thrice, sir.

287
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,830
'Dabbang?' - Of course I watched 'Dabbang'.

288
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,450
I watched it umpteen times.

289
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,750
Did you write all these films?

290
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,580
I almost did.

291
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,950
I had all these ideas.

292
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,450
But...someone else made the films.

293
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,700
I didn't even write it on paper.

294
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,540
I had cooked it up fresh in my mind.

295
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,160
Yet they stole it.

296
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,790
That means you never wrote anything.

297
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,330
I will...for you.

298
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,580
I can see an actor in your eyes.

299
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,580
I can see your future. You're going to be a superstar.

300
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,450
Have you brought a photo? - Yes, sir. I did.

301
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:12,000
Just a minute.

302
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,830
Here.

303
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:22,080
That's a stamp. - It's a photo.

304
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,870
So small?

305
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,120
It will make your future small. - I see.

306
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,120
Big. Bring a bigger photo.

307
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,700
And listen.

308
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,660
Get me a whiskey...

309
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,700
..while coming back.

310
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,410
Okay?

311
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,290
Listen.

312
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,450
Buy a big bottle.

313
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:45,580
Think big, only then can you make it big.

314
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,160
"This night and this separation.. It's important I meet you."

315
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,160
"This night and this separation.. It's important I meet you."

316
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,450
How much?

317
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,750
She's here. She's here.

318
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,540
She's here. That girl's here.

319
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,450
Get up everyone. Get back to work. Get back.

320
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:14,660
What are you doing, sir?

321
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,540
Kajal's here, sir. Get up. Get up.

322
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,910
Kajal's here.

323
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,500
Borekar, don't bore me..

324
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,750
Complaint Kajal, sir.

325
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,870
I think she's got a new complaint.

326
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,040
Where's inspector Ghorpade?

327
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,700
Come, sir. Some boys are causing vandalism outside City Mall.

328
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,120
Come right now and arrest them.

329
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,410
I can't come now.

330
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,620
Register your complaint like you always do.- And then I'll take action

331
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,290
Don't you see I am busy?

332
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,830
Yes, I can see how busy you are.

333
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,200
First learn to hold the FIR book correctly.

334
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,410
And come with me.

335
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,910
Otherwise I'll complain to the ACP.

336
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,410
Additional Commissioner.

337
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,370
Jt. Commissioner Khare, sir. - Madam..

338
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,000
The Commissioner.. - Madam, madam..

339
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,160
Have a glass of water.

340
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,370
Sir, better hurry up.

341
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,660
The speed at which she's going..

342
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,950
..she'll definitely get to the CM or PM.

343
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,580
So what have you decided? - What have we decided?

344
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,870
We'll arrest them.

345
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,500
And we'll do it now.

346
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,290
Boys. - Yes, sir!

347
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,080
We've to arrest some hooligans outside City Mall.

348
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,120
Follow me. - Sir.

349
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,200
Do you recognise all of them?

350
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,540
One of them is the Counsellor's son. Ashok Pure.

351
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,080
Ashok..

352
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,580
Well, let's see.

353
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,040
And the other is MLA Gulab Thakur's nephew.

354
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,620
Lal Thakur.

355
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,830
Him too? We'll try.

356
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,790
And Gudappa Das' brother-in-law.

357
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,750
Dharam Prakash. DP.

358
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,830
Then I'll have to think about it. - What did you say?

359
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,540
Borekar. - Yes, sir.

360
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,330
The goons have threatened to kill your father today, right?

361
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,700
Sir, my father's already.. - Your father..

362
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,330
..that lives in the room above.

363
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,950
Try to understand, Borekar? - What? - Yes. Yes.

364
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,540
We'll deal with those goons later.

365
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,250
First we need to save Borekar's father.

366
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,870
Boys. - Yes, sir.

367
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:48,410
Follow me.

368
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,160
Let's go, sir.

369
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,950
I get it, Inspector.

370
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,700
You're evading your duty.

371
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,950
But there must be one brave inspector in the city.

372
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,700
I am there.

373
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,160
I'm shooting.

374
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,160
The law has long arms.

375
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,450
That wasn't a pose.

376
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,450
Yes, mom. - Son. How are you?

377
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,410
Absolutely fine, mom.

378
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,370
What's the progress on your admission in the police

379
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,500
Yes....yes, mom. I'm preparing for that.

380
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,580
Good. Good. Give me the good news, soon.

381
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,330
Of course I will, mom. - And look after yourself.

382
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,790
And keep calling... whenever you get the time.

383
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,910
Good thing we got pictures of you in two getups.

384
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,700
Yes, that's great.

385
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,500
Hey!

386
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,120
Where are my clothes?

387
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,540
Where could they go?

388
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,870
Were you wearing clothes when you came in?

389
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,410
You think I came in nude?

390
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,160
Don't get angry, you will get your clothes back.

391
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,410
Wear this. This is the new 'Kathiawadi' dress.

392
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,540
It'll look nice on you.

393
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,250
If I wear this outside, people will think I'm crazy.

394
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,750
Then wear what you're wearing now.

395
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,370
People will salute you.

396
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,580
You want my scooter for few days, right?

397
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,580
Take it.

398
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,290
Let's go, quickly. - Who are you?

399
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,040
Follow that black car. - But I..

400
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,620
Stop talking, let's go.

401
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,580
A girl's being abducted in that black car.

402
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,830
You don't understand.

403
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,120
This is no time to talk, Inspector.

404
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,250
It's time for action. Let's go, quickly.

405
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,540
Help!

406
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,410
That car's speeding away, hurry up.

407
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,160
Look, you're mistaken.. - No, I'm not.

408
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,790
I heard it myself. The girl was yelling, "Help! Help!"

409
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,250
It means the girl's in danger.

410
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,410
Drive faster.

411
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:39,660
There is the car.

412
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,750
Help! - Keep quite.

413
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,290
Somebody help me.

414
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,250
There's a police inspector following us, sir.

415
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,450
What nonsense!

416
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:47,950
Inspector Ghorpade said..

417
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,700
..there won't be any policeman there.

418
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,290
Okay. Calm down. Calm down.

419
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:56,290
I know, show my photo to the inspector.

420
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,580
How dare he?

421
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,160
He's showing you his boss' photo.

422
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,620
He's mocking you.

423
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,620
We will catch them now. We won't spare them. Driver faster. Faster.

424
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,330
Why are you taking wrong way, Inspector?

425
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,290
He changed route seeing your photo.

426
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,870
Very good. Very good.

427
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,200
Sir, the girl's going that way and you're going this..

428
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,620
What kind of an inspector are you? - I'm no inspector.

429
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,200
There goes the real inspector.

430
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,700
Lion-heart inspector.

431
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,370
Who? - Inspector Chulbul Pandey!

432
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:34,450
Robinhood Salman Khan!

433
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,830
Sir, there's a policeman following us.

434
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,830
Police? What now?

435
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,040
Did you jump a signal? - No, sir.

436
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,620
PUC? - It's there. Insurance? - It's there.

437
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,750
License? - It's there. Do you want me to speed up?

438
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,370
Do you wish to take me to the moon?

439
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,830
'Wanted', 'Dabbang', 'Ready', 'Ek Tha Tiger'.

440
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:53,040
What a body. Fantastic fighter.

441
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,370
Bhai!

442
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:58,370
Bhai! - Sir..

443
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,910
What happened, sir?

444
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:08,540
I'm a big fan. - I see. Thank you.

445
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,450
Can I get an autograph? - Of course.

446
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,160
Hey, hold on to this.

447
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,450
Sir.

448
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,660
Careful.

449
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,120
Your name? - Vishwas.

450
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,290
Vishwas.

451
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:27,450
Her name?

452
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:32,450
Her name? - Don't know.

453
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,330
Kajal. - Kajal.

454
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,290
Very nice. To Vishwas and Kajal.

455
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,910
Here. - Thank you, bhai.

456
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,790
Thank you. - Welcome.

457
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,660
Someday I will be like you. - Of course.

458
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,870
Of course, you sure can. - Bye.

459
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,830
Side. Side.

460
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,370
Why would he become like me?

461
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,950
I pose as inspector in films.

462
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,790
And this inspector wants to be a movie star.

463
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,080
Anyone can be a hero these days.

464
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,410
He can too.

465
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,250
Listen, take me to Rajkumar Santoshi's office.

466
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,790
The narration of 'Andaz Apna Apna-2' is in progress.

467
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,410
Oh no!

468
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:20,160
Aamir again.

469
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,620
He looks more handsome in real life.

470
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,620
The black car's heading this way.

471
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,290
That inspector turned out to be really smart, sir.

472
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,620
He took a short-cut and cut us off.

473
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,410
What? What are you still thinking about?

474
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,870
Get out of there.

475
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,450
Forget the girl. Take the photo and make a run for it.

476
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,950
You goons. Where are you going? - Run. Run. Run.

477
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,580
Sir, we scared them off.

478
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,700
Thank you, sister. You saved me.

479
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,330
Not me, he did.

480
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,620
Thank him. He saved you.

481
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,160
Thank you officer, for saving me.

482
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,370
I am Suman Thappa.

483
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,950
Chief Security Officer Bhimsingh Thappa's daughter.

484
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,330
Sister, please give me your phone.

485
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,660
Thank you.

486
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,500
Sir, forgive me.

487
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,750
I misunderstood you. - You still misunderstand me..

488
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,450
No, no, now I know you very well.

489
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,040
Salman Khan was just an excuse.

490
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,000
Actually, you wanted to take a short-cut and cut them off. Right?

491
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,580
You're the first brave ..

492
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,290
.. and honest officer I've come across in the city.

493
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,950
I'm really impressed.

494
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,950
Sir!

495
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,410
Speak up.

496
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,040
How much more money do you want?

497
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:45,830
Like I said I don't know that inspector.. - Don't lie to me.

498
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:51,160
There was a time, when police officers were honest.

499
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,750
They had character.

500
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,700
We would grease their palms..

501
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,660
..and they would give us protection.

502
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,950
And today...even after paying money..

503
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,700
..we can't commit a small abduction in the city?

504
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,330
I'll talk to the department, Sir.

505
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,540
No need to talk.

506
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,540
Just give me the name of that inspector.

507
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,450
I really don't know who he is, sir.

508
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,700
Lying again.

509
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,870
Biscuit.

510
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:23,330
You won't make this mistake again.

511
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,330
Yes, sir,

512
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,870
Sir...

513
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:33,330
...maybe that inspector's one of Jt. Commissioner Khare' man.

514
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,870
Right.

515
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,080
You're right, Ghorpade.

516
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,080
Thank you, sir. - Biscuit.

517
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,950
So you are wearing Vishwas' clothes.

518
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,620
If you keep this up, someday you'll be defamed.

519
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,620
"I will be defamed."

520
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,330
I'm from the DNA paper.

521
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,330
Mr. Lalwani was supposed to give me a photograph.

522
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,910
Daddy, someone's here from the DNA paper.

523
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,040
Yes. Give him the inspector's photo.

524
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:05,040
It's kept ready on the table. - Ready?

525
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,500
Stop, sister. Stop.

526
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,660
Good news.

527
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,080
Vishwas has become a police inspector. - What?

528
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,120
Look, his photo's been published in the papers.

529
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,370
Oh!

530
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,120
What's written in it? - I don't know.

531
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,330
The paper's torn.

532
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,410
I got my hands on it in the temple.

533
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,250
Hail Goddess Durga! - Yes, Lord.

534
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,410
My son's become a police inspector.

535
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,160
Take this. You take too.

536
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,750
My son's become a police inspector.

537
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,200
My son's become a police inspector.

538
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,750
Thief!

539
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,540
Thief! Thief!

540
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,410
Thief!

541
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,950
He won't stop if you yell "Thief". - Then what do we do?

542
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,750
Shout "Police", they will nab him. - Yes. Police!

543
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,250
All you need is one break..

544
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,750
..and you will be a movie star.

545
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,250
Like this.

546
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,410
Movie star?

547
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:05,410
Like this? - Police!

548
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,370
You're fantastic, sir.

549
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,330
No, no, it was a mistake.. - No, mistake.

550
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,040
Throwing that peel was just an excuse.

551
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:18,330
You wanted to catch the thief without laying a finger.

552
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,790
He's a police officer.

553
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,160
Honest. Brave. - Thank you, Officer.

554
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,830
This Gundappa Das' thug was fleeing with my diamonds.

555
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,080
Which station should I take him to? - Take him to any one.

556
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,750
Heard that. Take him away.

557
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,370
Come on! - Come.

558
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:32,750
Fantastic, sir.

559
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,160
You're always at the crime-scene.

560
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:39,160
But you arrive before me.

561
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,160
I am Kajal. - I am Vishwas.

562
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:48,160
Hello.

563
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,830
She looks like a heroine. - Yes, she does.

564
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:57,200
But she can't be yours. - Why?

565
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,540
She's a Mumbai girl.

566
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,250
She'll giggle while talking.

567
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,080
But if you try to flirt with her..

568
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,250
..she'll sick her dog on you.

569
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,410
What?

570
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:10,790
So don't love her, don't follow her.

571
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:14,790
Come on, follow me.

572
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:20,410
"Let's make deal of our love."

573
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,160
What deal? - Heart. Heart.

574
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,040
"Trade. Trade."

575
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,870
"Let's seal this deal."

576
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:32,540
"Tight. Tight. Very tight."

577
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,330
"Let's make an agreement with the eyes."

578
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:39,410
"And abide by it permanently."

579
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:44,750
"And let the heart, gripped with desires, say."

580
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,660
"Order. Order." - "Don't try to stop me."

581
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,540
"Don't object if I follow you."

582
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,290
"Don't try to stop me."

583
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:01,250
"Don't object if I follow you."

584
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,160
"I've a right on you."

585
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,120
"You're my delight."

586
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:09,000
"Don't be shocked if I obstruct your way."

587
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,910
"Don't sick your dog on me."

588
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:16,790
"Don't try to stop me."

589
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:20,660
"Don't try to stop me."

590
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,580
"Don't object if I follow you."

591
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,540
"You're right beside me."

592
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,580
"I am right next to you."

593
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,540
"You're right beside me."

594
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,540
"I am right next to you."

595
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,410
"You're right beside me."

596
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,540
"I am right next to you."

597
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,370
"You're right beside me."

598
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,830
"I am right next to you."

599
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:43,830
"Wait. What are you doing?"

600
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:00,700
"I'll love you like a cheapskate."

601
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,580
"And shower you only with excuses."

602
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,370
"Call back when I give a miss call."

603
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,790
"Otherwise I'll die for the sake of your love."

604
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,750
"Mahiwal's uncle."

605
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,660
"Farhad's uncle."

606
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,200
"Don't consider me less than Majnu himself."

607
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,080
"I'm your true lover, don't shun me."

608
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,120
"Don't sick your dog on me."

609
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:31,000
"Don't try to stop me."

610
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,830
"Don't object if I follow you."

611
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,830
"You're right beside me."

612
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,790
"I am right next to you."

613
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,750
"You're right beside me."

614
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:44,750
"I am right next to you."

615
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:11,000
"Tell me when you step out of home."

616
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,870
"So I can wait for you at the next turn."

617
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:18,620
"These days I'm quite busy."

618
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,040
"It's not easy for me to wait."

619
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,040
"I'm a road-Romeo."

620
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,950
"But I still want your heart."

621
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:29,540
"Don't leave me stranded on the road."

622
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,290
"Break my heart, but not my head."

623
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:37,160
"Don't sick your dog on me."

624
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,000
"Don't try to stop me."

625
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,200
"Don't object if I follow you."

626
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,080
"You're right beside me."

627
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,040
"I am right next to you."

628
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,160
"You're right beside me."

629
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,950
"I am right next to you."

630
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,750
"You're right beside me."

631
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,790
"I am right next to you."

632
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,870
"You're right beside me."

633
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,870
"I am right next to you."

634
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:26,290
Keep silence. Careful.

635
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,750
Hello. - Hello.

636
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,870
Remove the track.

637
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,620
Shabbo.

638
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:40,500
As soon as you step out of the swimming pool.. - Sir!

639
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,830
I am Yogi.

640
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:46,040
You said you've a role.

641
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,540
He's a good actor.

642
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,330
Touch sir's feet.

643
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,040
At least say hello.

644
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,950
Hello, sir. I'm Vishwas Rao.

645
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:56,660
He won't do.

646
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,540
Shabbo.

647
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:06,040
As soon as you step out of the swimming pool.. - Sir, please!

648
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,160
Give me one chance. - What's this, Yogi?

649
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,540
Just give him one chance, just once.

650
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,660
He's a good actor. He'll do good.

651
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,910
This role won't suit him.

652
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:19,870
Okay?

653
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,500
Shabbo.

654
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,870
As soon as you step out of the swimming pool.. - Sir, please!

655
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,250
Oh gosh!

656
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,000
I will act well.

657
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,790
Look, this role is of a bad character.

658
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,950
You look more like a good character.

659
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:39,700
You can't do it. Okay.

660
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,580
Goodbye.

661
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,000
Shabbo.

662
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,660
As soon as you step out of the swimming pool..

663
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,250
Sir, please.

664
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,500
At least see my acting first.

665
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Sir, when am I coming out of the pool?

666
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,830
You will. You will.

667
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,410
What are these?

668
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,540
What are these?

669
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,660
Eyes, sir.

670
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,450
They are cameras.

671
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:11,000
I can tell what one can, or cannot do.

672
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,370
You cannot do it.

673
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,910
Go. Get out! - No, sir.. Come.

674
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,370
Illiterate children of.. - Hey!

675
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,790
Don't utter a word against my mother!

676
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,410
I'll yank your tongue out!

677
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:27,450
He's.. - What director? To heck with such a director.

678
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,620
He only copies Madrasi and Hollywood films..

679
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,500
..to earn this fame. - Hey, you..

680
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,160
Hey!

681
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,500
Make a sound and I'll kill you right now.

682
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,540
Hey, mister.. - Move back! Back!

683
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,290
Move back! Back!

684
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,620
You were wrong.

685
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,540
You shouldn't have insulted my mother.

686
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,290
She's a mother after all.. - Stop this..

687
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:50,950
Quiet!

688
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,500
I came here for job.

689
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I didn't come here to beg you.

690
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,910
I wanted to become an actor.

691
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:01,700
It was my childhood dream.

692
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,700
I thought I would come to Mumbai, work hard..

693
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,290
Carve a niche for myself.

694
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:08,450
But this stupid..

695
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,330
..is in a hurry to get her out of the pool.

696
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:14,580
That's why he's throwing us out!

697
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,660
Let's go, Vishwas, he.. - What did I say to him?

698
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,950
I said "Give me a chance. Give me a chance to act".

699
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:24,950
He says, "These are.."

700
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,500
Vishwa.. - What did you say?

701
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,330
No..

702
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,750
What are these?

703
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,120
What are these? What are these?

704
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,120
Eyes. - No. Camera.

705
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:45,120
Yes. Camera. - Yes.

706
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,910
You can see everything.

707
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:50,830
So...what am I going to do? - What?

708
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:54,330
Say it, otherwise your camera..

709
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,290
Sir, is this bad enough?

710
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:59,450
What? - You said it's a bad character.

711
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,450
Yes.

712
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,410
Acting? - Yes, sir.

713
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:04,870
Good.

714
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,910
I can be worse, sir. - No, no. Good.

715
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:09,830
Bad. Good. Bad.

716
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,080
Good..

717
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,870
Very good. Very good.

718
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:15,580
Selected.

719
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,000
Great, sir.

720
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,830
What happened? - He got the role.

721
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,580
What are you saying?

722
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,750
He's a star now. Star.

723
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,200
The phone's ringing.

724
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,160
It's ringing. Answer it. Mother.

725
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,750
Yes, mom. How are you?

726
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:36,000
I never thought you'll do this to me.

727
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,540
I know everything.

728
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,160
Sorry, mom, I.. - Be quiet.

729
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,660
You got selected as a police officer and didn't tell me.

730
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,750
Police officer? - Enough.

731
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:49,450
Stop with your charades.

732
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:52,040
I saw your photo in the paper.

733
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,950
In the police uniform. - Photo?

734
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:57,540
Police? - I am coming to Mumbai day-after-tomorrow.

735
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,370
For three days. - What?

736
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,700
I've a desire to see you in the police uniform.

737
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,370
To see you doing your duty.

738
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:08,370
My train will arrive at 3 o'clock. Pick me up from the station.

739
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,700
No, Guru. I can't do it.

740
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,870
I've already lied to mother before.

741
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,500
I've hurt her once.

742
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,450
I can't hurt her anymore.

743
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,750
You've great sentiments.

744
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,370
Tomorrow when she finds out that..

745
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:25,330
..you're preparing to be an actor, not a police officer..

746
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:27,200
..do you think it'll make her happy?

747
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,750
What do I do, Guru?

748
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,540
What do I do? - Just do as I said.

749
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,540
Just pose as a police inspector..

750
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,830
..in front of your mother, that's it.

751
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:37,120
Just like Sanjay Dutt posed as a doctor in 'Munnabhai'?

752
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:40,950
Exactly, son. Same to same.

753
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:42,580
Mom's coming home for three days.

754
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,250
We'll borrow a house, jeep and a police uniform for few days.

755
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,830
You just have to pretend that you're a police inspector.

756
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,290
Guru, this will give us a chance to act as well. - Right.

757
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,040
We'll act really well, Guru. - Right.

758
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,410
And I'll do the best acting of my life.

759
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:01,410
See. Everything's very good.

760
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,500
Mother. - No. Don't touch my feet while you're still in uniform.

761
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,620
Respect it.

762
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,200
Give it to me.

763
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,910
What happened, mom? - Nothing.

764
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,910
Nothing.

765
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:43,290
How are you? - I'm fine.

766
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:46,540
How are you? - Me?

767
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,250
Inspector Vishwas Rao. - Hello, Father Anthony Gonzalez.

768
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,750
God bless you, my child. God bless you.

769
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,000
You did a splendid job by closing down..

770
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,410
..the bars and gambling dens in our area.

771
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,000
That's my duty, Father.

772
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,790
I'm so proud of you, my child!

773
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:11,910
A honest, loyal, capable, talented police officer like you..

774
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,580
..can't be in our area.

775
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:21,250
Inspector Vishwas. I would like to... meet your mom, just once.

776
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:22,910
She's my mom, Father.

777
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:25,620
Oh!

778
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,330
I am so lucky to be meeting you.

779
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,540
How many sons do you have?

780
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,580
I have just one son.

781
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,580
How sad. How very sad.

782
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,540
Why didn't you have some more children? - What?

783
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,790
It would've been in the interest of the country.

784
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,910
You're just great to give birth to an officer like him.

785
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,120
Bless me, O mother!

786
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,330
He's taking her blessings.

787
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:51,080
Bless me so that next time I can be your son..

788
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,250
..and a brave officer like him. Make my country proud.

789
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:57,160
Excuse me, lady Is that your bag? The red and yellow. - No, no.

790
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,950
Okay, thank you.

791
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:06,370
Son, where's the priest? - Mom. It was time for his prayers.

792
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:08,620
Go on, son.

793
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,620
Don't disgrace your Guru.

794
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:16,450
I am very happy. - Hello, sir. - Hello.

795
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:20,410
Sir. Is she your mother? - Yes. She is.

796
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:22,790
Hello, madam. - Hello.

797
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:26,160
I want to be honest with you.

798
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,950
Your son.. - Yes.

799
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:31,330
Your son...isn't a police officer. - What?

800
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,370
He's not a police officer. - What are you saying?

801
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:35,200
He's God.

802
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,160
God, dressed in a uniform.

803
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:43,330
You risked your life alone, to protect us helpless..

804
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:46,750
..and drove out 50 goons.

805
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:50,700
And you thrashed them so hard that. - How?

806
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,330
He thrashes them so hard..

807
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:55,200
..the other goons fled for their lives hearing them scream.

808
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,660
You are...the protector of the poor.

809
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,540
You...are just!

810
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,410
You are...the pride of our country.

811
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:09,870
"May our flag always soar high."

812
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:13,330
"The pride and glory of our country."

813
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:16,660
"May our flag always soar high."

814
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,410
Before he goes up the Red Fort with the flag..

815
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:20,580
Bring him down? - Hmmm.

816
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:21,750
Coolie. - Yes.

817
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:25,870
O Inspector. I'll build a shrine for you.

818
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:29,200
Aunt. I'll keep you there too. - What?

819
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,200
And...worship you both..

820
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:40,410
Aunt, are those black and yellow bags yours? - No. - Sorry.

821
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:42,450
Where is he?

822
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:44,540
Mom, it was time for him to pray.

823
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,540
Come, mom.

824
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:54,950
One minute. I will just move it.

825
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:56,200
Do fast.

826
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,870
Anyone there?

827
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:00,080
Some one help.

828
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,700
Vishwas, what's going on?

829
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,000
Where, mom?

830
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,950
Look. Some goons are beating them up. - Help!

831
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:09,950
Where, mom?

832
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:14,790
Not there, here.

833
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:18,580
Save me, Inspector.

834
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:19,950
They are calling you. - No, no.

835
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:22,660
Mom...they aren't calling me, but their area's inspector.

836
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,450
Mister, hurry up. - Done, sir.

837
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:27,000
Go take a look. - I can't go, mom.

838
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,580
This isn't my area.

839
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,410
Hurry up. - You mind your area, and I'll deal with them.

840
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,580
Mom. Mom.

841
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,000
Mom.

842
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,330
Move back.

843
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:40,160
Stop. - Who are you, woman?

844
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,410
I'm the inspector's mother.

845
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:43,950
Mom, what are you doing? Let's go.

846
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:46,540
Inspector. Are you new in the area?

847
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,620
What would you do if he was old? - Mom, wait.

848
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,330
Inspector, we've been running this school for 60 years.

849
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,830
And now Gudappa Das' henchmen want to force us out.

850
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:59,950
They want to build a dance bar here.

851
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:01,790
Are you done? You heard enough?

852
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:03,870
Once the bar opens you can come have free food.

853
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:05,080
Get going.

854
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,410
Vishwas. What's he saying? - Yes..

855
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:09,620
How dare you scold me in front of my mother?

856
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,410
Not just that, he's scolding you, a police officer.

857
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:17,160
Yes, mom. I'm a police inspector.

858
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:22,160
What's your name? - Stupid. Insects like you..

859
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:26,160
..know me for my fist, not my name.

860
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:34,750
Good one, mom? - First class.

861
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:41,620
Stop that and thrash him. - I will.

862
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,370
What did you say? - Get lost!

863
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:47,370
Get lost!

864
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:11,660
This is our house, mom.

865
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,200
Isn't it first class?

866
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:18,250
Wow! You've such a big house.

867
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,910
No, mom. Not the one downstairs. That's closed.

868
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:23,370
We've just rented the top floor.

869
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:25,830
Rented? - No, aunt. Let me tell you.

870
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:29,620
Sir means the government has rented out the room to him.

871
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,080
Do you get it? Because they're happy with his work.

872
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:35,410
Of course. My son's done such a good job.

873
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:37,910
The government's got to be pleased.

874
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:41,450
Very good. Very, very, good.

875
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,540
Ghorpade. - Yes, sir.

876
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,120
Which new officer did you train in your police station..

877
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:50,080
..that's doing such a great job in your area?

878
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:53,450
The other day he saved a girl from abduction.

879
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:56,540
Then he apprehended the thief.

880
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,290
And today he thrashed Gundappa's goons.

881
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:00,870
Single-handedly.

882
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:04,120
I am impressed.

883
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,500
Sir, I.. - Of course.

884
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,620
I will put in a recommendation for your promotion.

885
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,700
I am very happy. - Sir, he really..

886
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,370
You really have done a good job.

887
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:18,040
I will put in a recommendation for your..

888
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,910
Borekar. What's this?

889
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,290
You had moustaches, didn't you?

890
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:27,290
I still do, sir.

891
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:33,750
Well. Gentlemen.

892
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,290
There's bad news.

893
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:40,000
Napoleon's coming to Mumbai.

894
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:44,370
Interpol's sent us some photographs of Napoleon.

895
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:47,120
Take a close look at these photos..

896
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:51,120
..and recognise him well.

897
00:53:55,910 --> 00:54:00,120
Did you get a good look?

898
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:03,700
Good! Smuggling. Drugs. Terrorism.

899
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,910
Napoleon takes contracts for all these.

900
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,330
According to the information received from RAW..

901
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,370
..he's coming to Mumbai soon.

902
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:14,080
To execute a dangerous mission.

903
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:18,290
And his mission's called 'Mission White Elephant'.

904
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:22,870
We've to thwart 'Mission White Elephant' at any cost.

905
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:25,580
And we've to catch Napoleon alive..

906
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,410
..and make Mumbai police proud.

907
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:31,580
And..

908
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:35,620
Let's catch him first.

909
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,160
Guru. How did you like mom's cooking? - Fantastic.

910
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,330
I say let's get some for dinner as well.

911
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:42,500
Hot vegetables.

912
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,580
I'm eating your cooked food after so long.

913
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,000
Feels so nice.

914
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,160
But, mom. It would've been so much better..

915
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,870
..if you could stay for few more days.

916
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,410
Why did you come for just three days?

917
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:55,410
Yes, son. I was thinking the same thing.

918
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,290
Water.

919
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:01,750
But, mom. How can you stay back here?

920
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,040
You've things to do back in the village. - Yes.

921
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,290
No, son.

922
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:06,540
When you're insisting..

923
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,500
..then I'll stay a few months with you.

924
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,540
Yes, yes. Of course.

925
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,540
But.. - Mind your duty, sir.

926
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:15,910
How can you stay back?

927
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:18,870
Three days later you've to leave with the CM for three months.

928
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:21,910
For security reasons. - Yes.

929
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:25,080
No. I'll refuse the CM.

930
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,290
I'll tell him, "My mom's arrived from the village,

931
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:28,450
.. so I'm staying with her".

932
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:32,950
Right, mom. - Duty comes first, mother later.

933
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:34,870
Don't worry about me. I'll come visit you again.

934
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:37,040
What?

935
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:41,040
She's saying she'll come visit you again. - Yes.

936
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,750
Good morning, sir.. Evening?

937
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,660
Afternoon, sir. - You called?

938
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,250
You sent that inspector again, Ghorpade..

939
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,830
..to beat-up my men.

940
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:57,250
Sir, I've told you before.

941
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:00,580
He's not one of us.. - Lying again.

942
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,830
Why don't you just say how much money do you want?

943
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:05,580
I don't want money, sir? - So?

944
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:06,950
Do you want property this time?

945
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:09,790
No, sir. I mean...I don't know who the inspector is.

946
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:12,450
Sir, that inspector thrashed us really bad.

947
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:13,660
He jumped kicked us.

948
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,370
He made us run for our lives, sir.

949
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:17,330
Look. He thrashed them so badly.

950
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:22,330
He beat Madan black and blue. - Sir, I'm Mohan.

951
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:24,160
He's beat them up so badly.

952
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:27,700
You can't make out who's Madan, who's Mohan.

953
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,290
We're going back to our village, sir.

954
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:30,620
See, Ghorpade.

955
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:31,830
Half of them are heading back to their village..

956
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:33,330
..and the other half are in the hospital.

957
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:35,620
Mission White Elephant is in its final stages.

958
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,410
Sir.. - Either you drag him here by his foot or his hair..

959
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:47,290
..but bring him to me, or else I'll skin you alive.

960
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:48,540
What?

961
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,830
Director Anees Bazmi's given an appointment?

962
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:54,000
Yes, Anees Bazmi. - Great, Guru.

963
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,700
I'll be right there.

964
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,870
Just don't let Anees leave. - Who is Anees?

965
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:02,540
Anees is a very big movie.. - Movie?

966
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,500
Don.

967
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:05,830
He's a don.

968
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:07,410
Just like there are dangerous villains in films..

969
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:09,660
..similarly, they are real life dons.

970
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,250
We finally managed to get a grip on them. I mean, find them.

971
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:16,250
So...I'll go make a plan to catch him. Give me your blessings.

972
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:30,000
No need to worry. I've found out everything.

973
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,290
Joint commissioner Khare's home is undergoing repairs.

974
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:37,160
So he's rented the ground floor of your home for a month. That's it.

975
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:40,910
Guru. If that joint commissioner sees me in uniform..

976
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:42,450
..he'll throw me in jail.

977
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:43,700
That won't happen.

978
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,620
Just do as you were doing until now. Acting..

979
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,620
Silence.

980
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,500
Hello, sir. - Hello.

981
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,620
My son's a police inspector too.

982
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,200
We live on the upper floor. - I see.

983
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,660
Yes. He just joined the police force.

984
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,500
He's closed down many bars and gambling dens. - I see.

985
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,370
And he beat up some criminals so badly..

986
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:12,410
..that the other goons fled the city hearing their screams.

987
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:15,000
What's his name?

988
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,120
Vishwas Rao.

989
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:21,700
Vishwas? - He's after some Don.. Yes.

990
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,450
He's planning to apprehend some don called Anees.

991
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:28,290
Anees? Anees Ismail? That dangerous don.

992
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:30,160
He's planning to catch him.

993
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:31,910
Then I would like to meet him right now.

994
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:35,910
What? - Yes.

995
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,450
You're laughing.

996
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:47,200
The commissioner's waiting for you downstairs..

997
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,040
Mom, you got fooled too.

998
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,540
You're so innocent.

999
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,700
He's no police commissioner.

1000
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,660
He's not the commissioner. Then?

1001
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,000
He's an actor. - Actor?

1002
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,160
He used to work as a commissioner in TV serials.

1003
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,620
One day he suddenly stopped getting work..

1004
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,330
..and lost his mind.

1005
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:06,750
Then? - He went mad.

1006
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,330
He dons the police uniform and sets out on the road.

1007
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:11,870
He goes and sits in any police station that he sees.

1008
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:15,500
Oh Lord! - Lord, have mercy on him.

1009
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,080
And he's been kept here for treatment. - I see.

1010
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:22,330
And those people around him, in uniform, are crazy. - What?

1011
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:23,870
I mean they're actors.

1012
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:26,330
They're acting so that he feels he's the commissioner.

1013
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:28,080
But why? - Because the doctor's said..

1014
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:29,830
..this is the only way to treat him.

1015
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:34,870
And the doctor's also said keep his illusion intact. - Why?

1016
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:40,080
Because if his illusion shatters, then he can lose his life.

1017
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:43,200
Heart-fail.

1018
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:44,790
Son..

1019
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,040
Son, we won't shatter his illusion either.

1020
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:53,080
You've got to act in front of him as well. - Mom. You know I can't act

1021
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:56,500
Try. - Okay, mom. I will.

1022
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,500
Only for you.

1023
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:06,750
My mom's..

1024
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,250
What?

1025
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:13,540
That's why I..

1026
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,620
Look, first speak then cry.

1027
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,330
Or first cry then speak.

1028
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:19,120
Don't speak and cry together, Inspector.

1029
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,500
I am not an inspector. - What?

1030
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,500
Yes. - And this uniform? - It's rented.

1031
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,660
I've worn it to keep my mother alive.

1032
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,660
What's this story? - It's a sad story.

1033
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,620
My mother loved watching films.

1034
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,000
One day she went to watch a film.

1035
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,450
The story of an honest officer and his mother.

1036
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:49,750
Suddenly, the fan above fell on my mother's head.

1037
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:51,540
Oh, my God! Then what?

1038
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,450
The fan stopped, but my mother lost her mind.

1039
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:57,500
Oh no. - Oh yes.

1040
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,250
Since then she thinks I'm a police officer.

1041
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:03,700
And I wear this uniform in front of her.

1042
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,500
But what do the doctors say?

1043
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,500
They say this is the only way to treat her.

1044
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,910
Keep her illusion intact. - Why?

1045
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:14,330
Because if I take off my uniform..

1046
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:18,080
..then my mother will lose her life.

1047
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,200
Keep this uniform on. - Yes.

1048
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:24,370
We'll keep your mother's illusion intact, Vishwas.

1049
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:28,370
Inspector Vishwas. - Yes.

1050
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,830
Mr. Commissioner, she's my mother. - Yes, we've met before.

1051
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:39,540
Mom, he's the Commissioner.

1052
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:41,500
My son really praises you.

1053
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,500
He says you're a big television.. - Mom..

1054
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Television?

1055
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,540
I mean, there's no other police officer like you in this city.

1056
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:49,950
Yes. - I am saying the right thing, isn't it?

1057
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:53,330
And I say, your son acts so well..

1058
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:58,950
Sir.. - Act? - I meant active.

1059
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:02,700
He's the most active inspector in our entire department.

1060
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,500
Right, Vishwas?

1061
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,200
Inspector Vishwas.

1062
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:08,830
Mr. Commissioner, do look after yourself. - Yes.

1063
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:11,790
You shouldn't go out on the streets wearing this uniform.. - Mom.

1064
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:13,500
Alone on the streets?

1065
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,620
I mean, you should keep your constables with you. - Yes.

1066
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:20,580
And you should watch fewer films. - Sir.

1067
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,120
I don't watch films.

1068
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:26,910
I do. I watch lots of films.

1069
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:33,000
Just a minute, madam. Just come with me. - Yes.

1070
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,290
Vishwas, what is she saying?

1071
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:38,370
Television serial? Don't roam the streets? I'm confused.

1072
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:42,830
There's no confusion. It's simple.

1073
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:45,120
Really? - You're not the joint commissioner.

1074
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:47,040
What? - For my mother.

1075
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:50,910
Yes. - But you are, for me. - Thank God.

1076
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:54,330
I'm a police inspector. - But you said you're not.

1077
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:56,000
For my mom, sir.

1078
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,000
But I'm not, for you.

1079
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,910
And.. - I get it. I understand.

1080
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:06,370
I'm the joint commissioner, but I am not.

1081
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:07,870
In your mom's view.

1082
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:11,370
And you're not a police inspector, but you are one.

1083
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:12,950
In your mom's view.

1084
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:14,910
And mother's a mother after all.

1085
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:17,410
But she isn't, in whose view?

1086
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:19,200
A mother's always a mother, in everyone's view.

1087
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,200
Sir, you're so.. - Yes.

1088
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:25,200
A mother's always a mother.

1089
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:30,410
There are bigger malls here in Mumbai.

1090
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:32,620
Hello, sir. I was looking for you.

1091
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,000
Sir.

1092
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,330
Hello.

1093
01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:38,580
Who is she? - She's my mother. - What?

1094
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,620
Sorry. Are you my mother?

1095
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,700
Vishwas.

1096
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,950
She's my mother. - Aunt.

1097
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:48,660
Bless you, dear.

1098
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,620
Who is she? - She's a girl.

1099
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,620
I know that, but who is she?

1100
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,000
She's a girl, and.. - Kajal.

1101
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,580
She's Kajal, mom.

1102
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:02,250
Whenever anything bad occurs in the city..

1103
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:03,620
..you will find her there.

1104
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,250
What? - Aunt, let me tell you.

1105
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:07,750
I'm a social worker. - Yes.

1106
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,790
Whenever I see anything wrong happening in the city..

1107
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:13,370
..I inform the police. - Great. You do the right thing.

1108
01:04:13,870 --> 01:04:16,330
And I'm here with a complaint right now, aunt. For him.

1109
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:19,330
Sir, Paradise club at Gol Chowki..

1110
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:22,450
..deal in every kind of illegal drugs and business.

1111
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:23,620
I just found out that..

1112
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,330
..some juvenile girls are being held captive there.

1113
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:28,000
Oh God! - Yes. Let's go.

1114
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,500
Let's go lodge a complaint with the police. - What?

1115
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,410
I'm the police.

1116
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:33,580
I'm the police.

1117
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,790
But that isn't my area, Kajal.

1118
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,910
So, go lodge a complaint with the area's inspector.

1119
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:40,660
Go fast. I did go there. - You did.

1120
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,080
But inspector Ghorpade isn't ready to listen.

1121
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,080
He isn't? - No. - Forget the area.

1122
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:47,580
Go, go with her. And free those girls. Go.

1123
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:48,950
I can't go, mom.

1124
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:50,540
I..

1125
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,370
Dear, which way? - Aunt.

1126
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:54,410
At Gol Chowki, there's a.. - Quiet.

1127
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:55,580
Hold this, mom.

1128
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:59,580
Let's go, mom. Come, Kajal. - Come.

1129
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:04,540
100 million in cash.

1130
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,910
Anything special? - It's very special.

1131
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:10,660
All this money is for 'Mission White Elephant'. - Oh!

1132
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:14,500
Remember. Gundappa sir has said, "Be careful".

1133
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:15,660
Don't worry.

1134
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,330
This is one of Gundappa sir's safest places.

1135
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,250
No one can come here. - Good.

1136
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:23,250
Let us go!

1137
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,200
What a club!

1138
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:32,040
Till now I only saw them in films.

1139
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:34,540
It's the Abode of Gods!

1140
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:39,540
Rambha. Menka. Urvashi. They're all here.

1141
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:45,870
They are not girls, they're vanilla ice-cream.

1142
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:49,660
Sir. What are you staring at?

1143
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,870
I wasn't staring. I was thinking,

1144
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:53,910
.. girls like you shouldn't go to a club..

1145
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:55,910
..like this to see such cheap dance.

1146
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:57,410
We should leave right now. Come on.

1147
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:59,040
Sir, we're not here to see the dance.

1148
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:00,540
We're here to free the girls.

1149
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,410
Inspector! - Don't you know that..

1150
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:05,120
..the police are not allowed in this club?

1151
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:07,080
So what are you doing here?

1152
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:11,750
Just taking a stroll around. Just like that.

1153
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:13,790
It's nice. - No, it's not.

1154
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:15,160
We're here to conduct a raid.

1155
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:17,200
I'm a reporter. And I've information that..

1156
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,200
..you've held some girls captive here.

1157
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:22,160
Bring them out. - Hey, girl. What nonsense.

1158
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:23,660
Calm down, Kajal. Calm down.

1159
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,660
Sir. Are you scared of fighting?

1160
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,790
No, I'm not scared. I enjoy fighting.

1161
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:30,370
You see, Kajal.

1162
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:35,250
If they injure my face my career will be over forever. - What?

1163
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:37,540
Let me talk to them. - You will talk to us?

1164
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:38,950
You will talk to us?

1165
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:41,790
Bachchan Singh!

1166
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:44,330
Muktar. Balbeer.

1167
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:46,410
Baktawar. Kallan.

1168
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:49,540
Why call so many people to talk?

1169
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,700
This is how we talk here. - Oh!

1170
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,370
Just mind your own business..

1171
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:57,080
..get something to eat and get lost. - Okay.

1172
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,040
We're here to teach you a lesson.

1173
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,500
This inspector is a bulldozer without brakes.

1174
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,580
Once he starts he doesn't stop.

1175
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,410
I see. - Move aside.

1176
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:09,790
Shoot him!

1177
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:13,080
"You don't know.'

1178
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:17,200
"You don't know who I am."

1179
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,410
"You don't know.'

1180
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:27,580
"You don't know who I am."

1181
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:31,410
"Naughty eyes."

1182
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:35,160
"Silky arms."

1183
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:38,870
"Sexy body."

1184
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:42,580
"I've a crazy gait."

1185
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,910
"You...you...you...you..."

1186
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:48,040
"You don't know.'

1187
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:52,040
"You don't know who I am."

1188
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:46,370
Kajal! - Sir. - Girls.

1189
01:08:46,870 --> 01:08:50,370
Come on, get out quickly. Run away!

1190
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:58,950
Money.

1191
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:08,290
What's going on here?

1192
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:12,160
Let's go.

1193
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:13,370
Attention!

1194
01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:15,580
Officer, attention..

1195
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,330
Ghorpade, we called you long ago. Ghorpade sir, this isn't right.

1196
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:20,870
Why did you take so long to come here?

1197
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:22,290
You have again sent the same inspector.

1198
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:28,290
No, I mean.. Move on.

1199
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:29,580
Breaking news.

1200
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,580
Police conduct a raid at Gundappa Das' Paradise club.

1201
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:35,950
On the orders of Gol Chowki police station's..

1202
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:37,410
..senior inspector Ghorpade..

1203
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:39,040
..one of his young officers, didn't just thrash the goons..

1204
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:41,200
..but also rescued some juvenile girls.

1205
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:43,700
And confiscated millions of rupees.

1206
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,200
Ghorpade sir, what would you like to say?

1207
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:47,620
Me?

1208
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:48,830
I am sorry, sir.

1209
01:09:49,330 --> 01:09:50,410
What do I say?

1210
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:52,450
I don't know who did it.

1211
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:54,500
I just arrived recently.

1212
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
How much is this?

1213
01:09:56,500 --> 01:10:00,000
Who told you?

1214
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,410
Kajal, what are you doing?

1215
01:10:02,910 --> 01:10:04,040
What if it starts raining?

1216
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:06,580
The doctor's asked you to keep the wound dry.

1217
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:07,870
It feels nice.

1218
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,540
Of course, all the girls were rescued.

1219
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,250
Except for one. - What?

1220
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,410
No, they all ran away.

1221
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:16,500
I saw it myself.

1222
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,750
Why are you laughing? - Just like that.

1223
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:23,500
Only crazy people laugh without a reason.

1224
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,620
I can't see a rickshaw around either.

1225
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,160
If it starts raining, we'll be in trouble.

1226
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:31,500
That'll be even better.

1227
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,500
I don't know, but everything seems nice.

1228
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I'm injured, but even that feels nice.

1229
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:41,870
Madam. Did you hit your head?

1230
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:45,870
Have you lost your mind?

1231
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:53,750
I grew up alone.

1232
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,370
I was very young,

1233
01:10:56,870 --> 01:11:00,370
when my parents..

1234
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,370
And,

1235
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:08,950
I never..

1236
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:12,040
..had a kin.

1237
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,250
Today,

1238
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:18,330
for the first time..

1239
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:22,080
.. It felt like..

1240
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:26,080
..I've a kin.

1241
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,120
"You're the dream."

1242
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:36,830
"I'm the slumber."

1243
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:42,540
"Together we make up the night." - I am always with you.

1244
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:53,750
"Every day I pray... that our wishes are fulfilled."

1245
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:57,750
"Our wishes are fulfilled."

1246
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:07,830
"I'm the colour of syrups."

1247
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:10,540
"And you're the sweet of river."

1248
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,200
"I'm the colour of syrups."

1249
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:15,700
"And you're the sweet of river."

1250
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:21,450
"Together...we can make up our story."

1251
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:23,830
"I'm the colour of syrups."

1252
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:26,540
"And you're the sweet of river."

1253
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,200
"I'm the colour of syrups."

1254
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:33,200
"And you're the sweet of river."

1255
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,000
"Slowly, calmly, I've woven your dreams together.."

1256
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:47,870
"..with my slumber."

1257
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:53,540
"I don't want the earth, or the heaven."

1258
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:58,410
"All I want is you in my life."

1259
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:01,250
"You're the saga of love."

1260
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:03,700
"And I'm naivety."

1261
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:09,410
"Together...we can make up our story."

1262
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:11,790
"I'm the colour of syrups."

1263
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:14,540
"And you're the sweet of river."

1264
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,200
"I'm the colour of syrups."

1265
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:21,200
"And you're the sweet of river."

1266
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:41,040
"Your thoughts are the only place I want to be."

1267
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:46,540
"You mean everything to me, always did."

1268
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:51,330
"The rest of the world is stranger to me."

1269
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:54,080
"You're a traveller."

1270
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:56,620
"I'm an unknown path."

1271
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,370
"Take me wherever you like.."

1272
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:02,370
"..we can make up our story."

1273
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:04,660
"I'm the colour of syrups."

1274
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:07,330
"And you're the sweet of river."

1275
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:10,000
"I'm the colour of syrups."

1276
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,580
"And you're the sweet of river."

1277
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:18,200
"Together...we can make up our story."

1278
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,700
"I'm the colour of syrups."

1279
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:27,700
"And you're the sweet of river."

1280
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:31,250
The cash that I sent for 'Mission White Elephant'..

1281
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:33,000
..was confiscated.

1282
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:34,950
Why? - Yes, sir.

1283
01:14:35,450 --> 01:14:38,040
There's a police inspector..

1284
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:43,790
..who, for no reason...always..

1285
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:47,950
Sir, I've seen that inspector.

1286
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:51,410
And...soon I'll find him.

1287
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:53,580
Finish him.

1288
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,080
And be careful.

1289
01:14:56,580 --> 01:15:00,250
RAW and Interpol are keeping an eye on our movements.

1290
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:02,330
Look.

1291
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:05,700
We won't discuss this any further.

1292
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,950
I'm sending you the entire information of this mission..

1293
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:10,790
..through an agent, on a CD.

1294
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:14,500
And make no mistakes.

1295
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,830
I'm arriving next week.

1296
01:15:17,330 --> 01:15:18,330
Okay?

1297
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:21,870
Brother Madhav, I have left for the station.

1298
01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:26,370
What's this crowd for? - Don't know, madam.

1299
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:27,750
I will miss my train.

1300
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:33,330
Hire another rickshaw. - How much?

1301
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:36,000
What is my mistake... let me go.

1302
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:37,700
Let me go.

1303
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,000
Don't beat me. Someone help me. - You lodge complaint.

1304
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:43,080
Come with me. - Leave me. Let me go.

1305
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:48,790
What is my mistake... don't beat me.

1306
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:52,330
Leave me.

1307
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:53,080
Someone help me.

1308
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:54,250
You lodge complaints. Come to the police station.

1309
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:57,580
Someone help me. - Leave her.

1310
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:01,120
Mom.. - Don't call me mom. Don't call me mom.

1311
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:05,120
You've humiliated your mother, not just this uniform.

1312
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:08,540
Why didn't you just die? Why didn't you die?

1313
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:12,250
What's going on? Get her out! Get her out!

1314
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:13,750
She's my mom.

1315
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:15,290
There is shooting going on here.

1316
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:19,290
There is shooting going on here.

1317
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:26,200
Listen to me, mom.

1318
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:30,200
Drive away this mad woman from here.

1319
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:42,790
Listen to me.

1320
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:44,080
Move from here.

1321
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:46,540
Don't touch my mother. Don't touch my mother.

1322
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,540
Listen to me, mom. Mom..

1323
01:16:55,200 --> 01:17:00,750
Mom..

1324
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:04,500
Mom!

1325
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,040
Someone get me a rickshaw.

1326
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:07,370
Someone get me a taxi.

1327
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:11,370
Someone get me a rickshaw.

1328
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:50,040
How's mom?

1329
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:55,950
Don't know.

1330
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,120
I'm not a police inspector, Kajal.

1331
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:20,120
I was only lying.

1332
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:24,410
I lied to mom as well.

1333
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:27,160
That's why she..

1334
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:28,910
Mom will be fine, Vishwas..

1335
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:36,540
"Mother.."

1336
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:43,080
"I know...I'm lonely."

1337
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:49,410
"How can I live...if you leave me?"

1338
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:55,910
"Don't stay silent, say something."

1339
01:18:56,410 --> 01:19:02,250
"You can scold me if you like."

1340
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:10,410
"You can scold me if you like."

1341
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:15,250
"Mother.."

1342
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:22,250
"Mother.."

1343
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:24,500
Will you do as I say, son?

1344
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:30,580
Of course, mom. I will. Tell me.

1345
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:34,750
Will you deceive me again?

1346
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:37,000
No, mom.

1347
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,540
Never again.

1348
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,450
Forgive me.

1349
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:45,870
What do you want?

1350
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:52,040
Get me...some poison.

1351
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:54,910
I don't want to live.

1352
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:56,750
Don't say that, mom.

1353
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,620
Don't say that.

1354
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,700
I'll never do anything wrong again.

1355
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,450
Never again.

1356
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:11,040
You acted so well.

1357
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:15,040
Even...your mother couldn't recognise you.

1358
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:23,000
You'll be a good actor.

1359
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,450
No, mom.

1360
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:31,950
I don't want to be an actor.

1361
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:34,450
I want to be a police officer.

1362
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:40,580
An honest police officer. I don't want to be an actor.

1363
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,870
Please go out, you are not allowed.

1364
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:45,620
Look, her condition's critical.

1365
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,450
She needs complete rest.

1366
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:50,910
Doctor, will my mother be okay? - We can't say right now.

1367
01:20:51,410 --> 01:20:54,910
Please leave.

1368
01:20:57,290 --> 01:21:00,870
Your mother will be fine, Vishwas.

1369
01:21:01,370 --> 01:21:04,700
She's just shocked.

1370
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,950
Because her dreams were shattered.

1371
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:11,950
When you were one year old..

1372
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:15,080
Your father was a cruel officer.

1373
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:17,370
He would take money from the rich..

1374
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:20,040
..and do their dirty jobs for them.

1375
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:22,540
'Savitri. Don't interfere.'

1376
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:23,790
'She's a decent girl, let her..'

1377
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:27,080
'I want to teach a lesson to this decent girl's father.'

1378
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:30,250
'That girl's father, Shashtri owned a factory..'

1379
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:33,040
'..which was the only means of earning for the villagers.'

1380
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,160
'The rich men wanted that land.'

1381
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:38,500
No, inspector. Don't do that. I will sign.

1382
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,540
'Helpless Shashtri signed on the papers.'

1383
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:45,540
'The same night both father and daughter committed suicide.'

1384
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:50,200
'People were furious, they set out to kill your father.'

1385
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:52,700
'I've told you before, stop these illegal deeds.'

1386
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,330
'The curse of these poor people..'

1387
01:21:54,830 --> 01:21:55,750
''..will never let us live happily.'

1388
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,950
'If anything happens to you..'

1389
01:21:58,450 --> 01:22:01,370
'The same old thing. The same old lecture.'

1390
01:22:01,870 --> 01:22:04,160
'I made a big mistake marrying you.'

1391
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:06,870
'I admit your father was an honest policeman.'

1392
01:22:07,370 --> 01:22:09,540
'But how did he die? A pauper.'

1393
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:12,540
'I don't want to die like that, Savitri.'

1394
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,200
'Everyone has to die one day.'

1395
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:15,540
'Everyone does.'

1396
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:18,410
'But the question is how does one live.'

1397
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:20,750
'If you want to live then come with me.'

1398
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:22,250
'They can come..'

1399
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:27,540
'Savitri..'

1400
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,250
'Listen.'

1401
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:33,250
'No..'

1402
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:04,120
'There are his wife and kid. Finish them!'

1403
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:06,450
'Stop!'

1404
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:09,040
'No one will lay a finger on them.'

1405
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:11,000
'I will break your heads.'

1406
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,870
'You will save them!'

1407
01:23:13,370 --> 01:23:16,250
Our curse will finish Yashwant Rao's family.'

1408
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:17,410
'We won't spare them either.'

1409
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:20,160
'We left the village. - Both mother and son will suffer.'

1410
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:22,790
'And your mother swore..'

1411
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:26,120
'..that she will repent for your father's crimes.'

1412
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:29,250
'By making you an honest police officer.'

1413
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:32,660
'And people will sing praises of your honesty.'

1414
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:36,370
'It will restore people's trust on policemen.'

1415
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:40,370
That's why she named you Vishwas (Trust).

1416
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:56,370
Mr. Vishwas.

1417
01:23:56,870 --> 01:24:01,580
Dr. Vinod Khanna's calling you.

1418
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,330
Vinod Khanna's turned a doctor?

1419
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:05,540
What? But he's always been a doctor.

1420
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,160
Come. - I see.

1421
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:10,410
So, he was acting in films just like that.

1422
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:12,200
Stop thinking about films, Vishwas.

1423
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:15,200
Vinod Khanna can be someone else's name too.

1424
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:16,620
Come on. - Yes, come on.

1425
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,040
Your mother's in a bad condition.

1426
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:20,830
We'll have to perform surgery.

1427
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:24,830
It'll cost around one million.

1428
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:27,500
One million?

1429
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,540
Deposit the money soon.

1430
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:33,870
We don't have much time.

1431
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:36,120
Start preparing for the surgery, Doctor.

1432
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:40,120
I'll get the money.

1433
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:44,120
Somehow.

1434
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:54,200
You are under arrest.

1435
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:57,120
For posing as a cop.

1436
01:24:57,620 --> 01:25:00,250
My mother's very ill.

1437
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:02,950
I've to arrange for one million for her surgery.

1438
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:05,080
I am sorry!

1439
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:09,200
Come with us.

1440
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:11,120
Come.

1441
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:13,410
Tell me, sir. Where are you taking me to?

1442
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:14,870
To us.

1443
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:16,870
Who said that?

1444
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:21,660
I...am Gundappa Das.

1445
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:25,080
But why bring me here?

1446
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:27,540
You need rupees one million.

1447
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,660
We'll help you.

1448
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:30,950
Why?

1449
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:32,370
Why will you give me the money?

1450
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:35,120
Because you will do a job for us.

1451
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:39,120
Look. I won't do anything wrong.

1452
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:45,910
No one pays one million for doing anything good, son.

1453
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:53,330
Hello. - Dr. Khanna, here.

1454
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:57,830
Your mother's condition is getting critical.

1455
01:25:58,330 --> 01:26:00,250
And you haven't paid the money yet.

1456
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:02,160
No, sir. I'm trying, sir.

1457
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:04,330
Please understand and do something fast.

1458
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:08,330
I'm trying.

1459
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:13,160
I want rupees one million.

1460
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:14,580
Tell me the job.

1461
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,950
A cultural dance troupe..

1462
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:19,160
..has arrived in Mumbai from Hong Kong.

1463
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:22,910
Our agent has sent a CD through them.

1464
01:26:23,410 --> 01:26:24,750
They're performing a show today.

1465
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:27,700
You'll go up on the stage during the show..

1466
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,080
..collect the CD and bring it here.

1467
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:33,540
But any of your henchmen can do this job.

1468
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,700
The security there is tight.

1469
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:39,250
And it's impossible for any stranger to get in.

1470
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:41,540
Then how will I get in?

1471
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:45,500
The chief security officer for the show is Bhimsingh Thappa.

1472
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,410
And we had kidnapped his girl..

1473
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:53,500
..and you rescued her on Link Road.

1474
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,450
'I am Suman Thappa chief security officer..

1475
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:57,870
..Bhimsingh Thappa's daughter.'

1476
01:26:58,370 --> 01:27:00,080
Both, father and daughter think..

1477
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:04,580
..you're an honest police officer.

1478
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:08,580
So with their help, you can easily get on stage.

1479
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:24,290
"I'm the bird that soars in the skies."

1480
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:27,500
"Beloved...you are the fruit that dangles on earth."

1481
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,540
"I'm the bird that soars in the skies."

1482
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:34,410
"Beloved...you are the fruit that dangles on earth." - "But.."

1483
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:37,500
"The heart's...definitely crazy."

1484
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,620
"It jumps up and down."

1485
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,580
"But it's always in the best mood."

1486
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,620
"One, two, three, four, five.." - "Do the crazy dance."

1487
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,790
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance."

1488
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:53,000
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance."

1489
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:57,000
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance."

1490
01:28:05,830 --> 01:28:06,700
"You've an iron body."

1491
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,290
"You've an iron body."

1492
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:10,250
"My heart's like magnet."

1493
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:11,790
"My heart's like magnet."

1494
01:28:12,290 --> 01:28:13,000
"My heart.."

1495
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:14,950
"My heart's like the magnet."

1496
01:28:15,450 --> 01:28:17,660
"I've cancelled all others."

1497
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:19,660
"You're my true lover."

1498
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,160
"You're my true lover."

1499
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:24,040
"My lover.. You're my true lover."

1500
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:27,750
"Pleased in a moment, shuts up in the next."

1501
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:30,790
"My heart's technicolor. Changes in a moment."

1502
01:28:31,290 --> 01:28:34,040
"But it's always in the best mood."

1503
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:38,580
"It always counts one, two, three, four, five. - Do the crazy dance."

1504
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:41,750
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance."

1505
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:45,750
"Crazy, crazy...crazy, crazy dance."

1506
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:54,370
"Always talks lovey-dovey."

1507
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:55,830
"Every time my sweetheart shakes her waist."

1508
01:28:56,330 --> 01:28:57,500
"Drums play."

1509
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,250
"I'll pick every lock."

1510
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:00,830
"Because you're my key."

1511
01:29:01,330 --> 01:29:04,830
"Everyone's here to see this charade."

1512
01:29:10,410 --> 01:29:13,120
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance."

1513
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:16,330
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance."

1514
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:19,500
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance."

1515
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,580
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance."

1516
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,750
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance."

1517
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:29,750
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance." - Stop. Vishwas.

1518
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:37,250
Catch him, Ghorpade.

1519
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:41,250
Run! Run!

1520
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:39,580
Vishwas! Vishwas! What have you done?

1521
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,290
You killed two policemen.

1522
01:30:41,790 --> 01:30:44,830
Give me the gun.

1523
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:46,580
You were supposed to keep the police engrossed.

1524
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:47,830
How did they come here?

1525
01:30:48,330 --> 01:30:49,410
I don't know.

1526
01:30:49,910 --> 01:30:52,120
Come to your senses, Vishwas.

1527
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:53,950
The car's here. Run.

1528
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:56,660
Run!

1529
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:58,500
Go! Go!

1530
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:03,370
Vishwas killed two policemen, sir. - What?

1531
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:05,540
That's good, Ghorpade.

1532
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:07,830
Now Vishwas has no other option..

1533
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:11,410
..and we've a new lifetime gang-member.

1534
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:15,410
Good..

1535
01:31:22,370 --> 01:31:25,000
Kajal. Yes, Kajal. How's mom?

1536
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:26,950
Mom's not in the hospital, Vishwas.

1537
01:31:27,450 --> 01:31:28,410
She's not in the hospital?

1538
01:31:28,910 --> 01:31:32,410
We looked everywhere, but can't find her.

1539
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,620
Very good. Very good.

1540
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:44,660
Boys... - Where's my mom?

1541
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:47,580
Mom!

1542
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:50,500
She's right here.

1543
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,910
And she's perfectly alright.

1544
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:57,660
Don't worry. She's absolutely fine.

1545
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:00,620
She didn't need any surgery.

1546
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:02,200
She only had blood pressure..

1547
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:05,500
..and we controlled it with medication.

1548
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,330
So, why did you lie to me?

1549
01:32:07,830 --> 01:32:09,870
I told him to.

1550
01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:14,410
Because I wanted you to do this job.

1551
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:18,000
This is our gang-doctor.

1552
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:21,790
Just like a family doctor is called family doctor..

1553
01:32:22,290 --> 01:32:25,250
..similarly, I am his gang's doctor.

1554
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:28,620
What's this nonsense?

1555
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,080
Your lie ruined my entire life.

1556
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:33,540
I killed two policemen today, and you..

1557
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:36,790
Calm down, sonny. Calm down.

1558
01:32:37,290 --> 01:32:39,250
You asked me for a million rupees for surgery..

1559
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:43,250
..which I am giving you.

1560
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:46,370
To heck with your money.

1561
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:48,450
Where's my mom?

1562
01:32:48,950 --> 01:32:51,790
She's in that room.

1563
01:32:52,290 --> 01:32:55,540
She's angry with you.

1564
01:32:56,040 --> 01:33:01,370
You killed two policemen.

1565
01:33:01,870 --> 01:33:05,370
I had to tell her.

1566
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:18,750
You?

1567
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:21,160
Get out of here. Go away.

1568
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:22,950
I don't want to see your face.

1569
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:25,250
Listen to me, mom.. - I don't want to hear anything.

1570
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:28,250
I don't want to hear anything. Just go away. Just go away.

1571
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:32,700
Mother.. - Your mother's dead. Your mother's dead.

1572
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:37,830
Just go away. Go away or I'll kill myself right now. - I'm going.

1573
01:33:38,330 --> 01:33:41,080
No, mom. I'm going. - Just go away.

1574
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:45,080
Go away. - I'm leaving. Just go away.

1575
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,250
Your decision isn't right.

1576
01:33:55,750 --> 01:34:00,250
Once you join the gang, you won't have a way out.

1577
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:05,000
Let's go and tell the police.. - No, Kajal.

1578
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,700
Mom's in their captivity.

1579
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:11,250
You won't tell the police anything, Kajal.

1580
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:13,120
For my sake.

1581
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:16,160
But, Vishwas, how is this.. - Just forget me, Kajal.

1582
01:34:16,660 --> 01:34:20,450
Your world's full of bright life, hopes.

1583
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:25,700
My world's filled with darkness and nothing else.

1584
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:27,870
We cannot be together, Kajal.

1585
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:30,370
And..

1586
01:34:30,870 --> 01:34:32,540
And?

1587
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,500
And what?

1588
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,500
Say it.

1589
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:46,750
We won't meet again.

1590
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:52,330
I'm sorry.

1591
01:34:53,660 --> 01:34:56,200
"Without me.."

1592
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:59,080
"Without me.."

1593
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:02,040
"Without me.."

1594
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:04,700
"Without me.."

1595
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:10,370
"Without me you'll be happier."

1596
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:16,540
"Don't let my thought ever cross your mind."

1597
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,450
"Without me.."

1598
01:35:19,950 --> 01:35:22,290
"Without me.."

1599
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:25,160
"Without me.."

1600
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:29,160
"Without me.."

1601
01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:44,870
"I wonder where you're headed.."

1602
01:35:45,370 --> 01:35:50,620
"..leaving me at two ways."

1603
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:55,370
"You gave me happiness.."

1604
01:35:55,870 --> 01:36:01,200
"But you snatched it from me."

1605
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:04,200
"What did you get.."

1606
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:07,000
"What did you get.."

1607
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:12,540
"What did you get by making me cry?"

1608
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:18,620
"Don't let my thought ever cross your mind."

1609
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:21,500
"Without me.."

1610
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,500
"Without me.."

1611
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,500
"Without me.."

1612
01:36:37,290 --> 01:36:39,250
1000 kilos of cocaine,

1613
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:40,950
will be delivered tomorrow afternoon..

1614
01:36:41,450 --> 01:36:46,250
..to the special chamber of the Versova warehouse.

1615
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:49,000
The computerized lock will open..

1616
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:51,870
..only through the CD that I sent you.

1617
01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:56,790
Collect the consignment and keep it in your warehouse.

1618
01:36:57,290 --> 01:36:58,120
I'm arriving day-after-tomorrow.

1619
01:36:58,620 --> 01:37:01,040
Same place, same time,

1620
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:02,700
where I always land.

1621
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:04,500
Good bye.

1622
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,450
That's Napoleon sir's mission.

1623
01:37:08,950 --> 01:37:10,500
White elephant!

1624
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,500
1000 kilos of cocaine!

1625
01:37:42,830 --> 01:37:44,000
Hands up. No one moves.

1626
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:45,660
Load it. Load it. Load the goods.

1627
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,080
Get down. Get down. Jesse. Lock everybody up.

1628
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:50,410
Lock everyone up.

1629
01:37:50,910 --> 01:37:53,080
Lock. Lock them.

1630
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:57,700
Lock. Jesse. Call the area in-charge and call them here. Ok.

1631
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:03,910
I'm taking the truck to the police warehouse. - Yes, sir.

1632
01:38:04,410 --> 01:38:05,620
Vishwas, you?

1633
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:09,620
Stop.

1634
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:30,040
Vishwas.

1635
01:38:34,910 --> 01:38:38,000
Sir.. - How did Khare get there?

1636
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:40,160
They're policemen, they're bound to get there.

1637
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:41,580
But why did Vishwas go there?

1638
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:42,830
Didn't you tell him not to? - Yes.

1639
01:38:43,330 --> 01:38:44,290
He's a novice.

1640
01:38:44,790 --> 01:38:45,580
The commissioner must have arrested him..

1641
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:46,950
..and he must have blurted everything.

1642
01:38:47,450 --> 01:38:51,410
And the police must be on their way here. - Hey..

1643
01:38:51,910 --> 01:38:54,160
We're dead. - Saved.

1644
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:57,040
Here's your enemy, Joint Commissioner Khare.

1645
01:38:57,540 --> 01:38:59,500
And I've delivered your truck loaded with goods to your warehouse.

1646
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,660
Ghorpade. - Yes, sir.

1647
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:04,540
You here? - I work second shift here, sir.

1648
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,580
Aren't you ashamed? - I am, sir.

1649
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,620
Well done, Vishwas. Well done.

1650
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:11,660
Napoleon sir will be very pleased with you.

1651
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:13,250
To heck with your Napoleon.

1652
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:16,200
I'm doing this for my mom.

1653
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:18,080
My mom's suffering here.

1654
01:39:18,580 --> 01:39:19,580
I want to take her back to our village.

1655
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:21,040
How can you go?

1656
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:23,450
The entire Mumbai police will come here..

1657
01:39:23,950 --> 01:39:25,120
..looking for Khare sir.

1658
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:27,330
They won't. - Why?

1659
01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:29,660
Because he'll inform his department..

1660
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:31,950
..that he's going out of the city for a few days..

1661
01:39:32,450 --> 01:39:35,950
..and they shouldn't look for him. - No, I won't.

1662
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:38,040
What?

1663
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:39,580
You will.

1664
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:42,450
You will say it and also help us.

1665
01:39:42,950 --> 01:39:46,080
Will you say it or not?

1666
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:50,160
Speak. - Yes, I will. I will.

1667
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:54,330
Good boy. Tie him up.

1668
01:39:54,830 --> 01:39:57,250
Take some lessons from him, Ghorpade.

1669
01:39:57,750 --> 01:40:01,620
Take some lessons from him.

1670
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:05,540
Why are you tying up this poor man? - Tightly.

1671
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:08,750
Look, he's no police officer.

1672
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:12,120
He just likes to roam around in uniform. - Tie him.

1673
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:14,500
He's a television actor.

1674
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,040
I know, I know.

1675
01:40:16,540 --> 01:40:17,540
There's no television in your room.

1676
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:19,700
That's why we brought this actor here.

1677
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:22,700
Now watch him perform.

1678
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:26,700
Listen..

1679
01:40:32,370 --> 01:40:34,830
Madam.

1680
01:40:35,330 --> 01:40:38,830
I am actually the joint commissioner of police.

1681
01:40:39,330 --> 01:40:40,540
Let it be.

1682
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:43,120
Get yourself treated by a good doctor.

1683
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:48,500
No, try to understand.

1684
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Madam. These gang members..

1685
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:53,040
..were forcing Vishwas to do a wrong deed..

1686
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:56,370
..by making the excuse of your illness.

1687
01:40:56,870 --> 01:40:59,200
That's when he came to me.

1688
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:02,500
I won't do anything wrong again, sir.

1689
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,370
I've a suggestion, Vishwas. - Yes, sir.

1690
01:41:05,870 --> 01:41:06,700
Just like Gundappa said, collect the CD..

1691
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,370
..and deliver it to him.

1692
01:41:09,870 --> 01:41:12,200
Do they pay you too? - Oh shut up!

1693
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:15,540
I want you to join Gundappa's gang.

1694
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:17,120
That means they definitely do.

1695
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:20,910
Hey, sit down!

1696
01:41:21,410 --> 01:41:23,000
I've a plan.

1697
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:27,000
This way we can eradicate Gundappa and his gang.

1698
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:28,750
And that's why..

1699
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:32,580
..I want you to execute this job and enter his gang.

1700
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:36,950
I want you to join their gang and extract information..

1701
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:39,500
I got it, sir.

1702
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,750
Just like Amitabh Bachchan did in 'Don'.

1703
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:43,410
Right, sir?

1704
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:45,500
Yes.

1705
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,330
And if you do that, they will pay for your mother's surgery.

1706
01:41:50,830 --> 01:41:52,330
She will receive treatment.

1707
01:41:52,830 --> 01:41:56,790
And you will join their gang and work as a police informer.

1708
01:41:57,290 --> 01:41:59,830
I will work for the police?

1709
01:42:00,330 --> 01:42:03,040
My mother will be really happy.

1710
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:05,410
Sister, for your happiness..

1711
01:42:05,910 --> 01:42:08,330
..Vishwas agreed to do policeman's job.

1712
01:42:08,830 --> 01:42:12,870
While doing this job, you will kill two policemen.

1713
01:42:13,370 --> 01:42:14,500
What are you saying, sir?

1714
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,500
Not really. Fake bullets. Fake deaths.

1715
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:23,330
This way Gundappa will start trusting you.

1716
01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:26,750
And he won't kill you, instead he'll let you join his gang.

1717
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:29,120
What an idea, sir.

1718
01:42:29,620 --> 01:42:33,160
No one can imagine that you can think so well. - Thank you.

1719
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:34,830
What did you say? - See you, sir.

1720
01:42:35,330 --> 01:42:36,790
Stop. - What now?

1721
01:42:37,290 --> 01:42:38,790
Vishwas, keep this watch.

1722
01:42:39,290 --> 01:42:41,040
Whenever you press this button..

1723
01:42:41,540 --> 01:42:42,950
..a light will blink on the other watch.

1724
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:45,700
After that, regardless of where we are..

1725
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:49,500
..we can talk to each other, through this watch-phone.

1726
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,120
Now watch. I'll talk and you listen. - Sir.

1727
01:42:54,620 --> 01:42:56,200
Hello, Vishwas.

1728
01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:57,450
I've entrusted you with the job..

1729
01:42:57,950 --> 01:43:00,410
..of a secret agent for the Mumbai Police.

1730
01:43:00,910 --> 01:43:04,450
You'll have to do this job with great responsibility.

1731
01:43:04,950 --> 01:43:06,620
Are you listening?

1732
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:09,450
Of course, sir. I'm with you, sir.

1733
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:13,410
You had to stand there and listen over the watch-phone, idiot!

1734
01:43:13,910 --> 01:43:14,870
Where are you going?

1735
01:43:15,370 --> 01:43:17,660
To stand there and listen, sir. - Vishwas.

1736
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:19,330
Sir..

1737
01:43:19,830 --> 01:43:21,290
Will you be able to do this job?

1738
01:43:21,790 --> 01:43:24,000
Of course, sir. I'll do it really well.

1739
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:26,250
Okay.

1740
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:28,160
Then keep this phone. - Thank you, sir.

1741
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:29,700
But I have a phone.

1742
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:32,620
This isn't for making calls, Vishwas.

1743
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:35,540
When you press this button twice..

1744
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:38,200
..it will give out a blinding flash..

1745
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:42,250
..and severe everyone's vision for a while.

1746
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:44,330
This will help you when you're in trouble.

1747
01:43:44,830 --> 01:43:45,620
Wonderful, sir.

1748
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:49,120
You just turned me into James Bond, sir.

1749
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:51,160
Why did you press the button now?

1750
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:52,620
I was testing it, sir.

1751
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:56,040
You could've told me so. I would've closed my eyes.

1752
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:58,660
Now listen. - Sir, I can't see a thing.

1753
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:01,790
You need ears to listen.

1754
01:44:02,290 --> 01:44:03,200
I do have ears, sir.

1755
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:06,040
So, look.. - I can't see, sir.

1756
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:10,500
Oh God! Listen and understand. - Yes, sir.

1757
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:14,250
The secret, that you're working for Mumbai Police..

1758
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:16,160
..you won't reveal it to anyone.

1759
01:44:16,660 --> 01:44:18,120
Not even your mother. - Why, sir?

1760
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:21,910
If the gang-members find out, they will shoot you. - Oh gosh!

1761
01:44:22,410 --> 01:44:23,450
And if you have an encounter with the police..

1762
01:44:23,950 --> 01:44:25,450
..they will kill you too. - Oh God!

1763
01:44:25,950 --> 01:44:26,750
But why, sir?

1764
01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:29,750
I'm working for the police. - Yes.

1765
01:44:30,250 --> 01:44:32,790
You know it, I know it..

1766
01:44:33,290 --> 01:44:35,120
..but the police department doesn't.

1767
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:37,410
I can see again.

1768
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:39,160
Where are you?

1769
01:44:39,660 --> 01:44:41,040
There you are. - Sir..

1770
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:42,200
Sir, I suggest that you write it down on paper..

1771
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:43,250
..that I work for the police department..

1772
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:44,450
..and keep it somewhere safe. - Why?

1773
01:44:44,950 --> 01:44:47,580
Because, if you die I'll be in trouble.

1774
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,750
Amitabh had to face lot of problems in 'Don', sir.

1775
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:51,950
Fine, fine. I will.

1776
01:44:52,450 --> 01:44:54,620
But now you go and execute your mission cautiously.

1777
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:56,620
Good luck.

1778
01:44:57,120 --> 01:45:00,910
Vishwas is working for the police.

1779
01:45:01,410 --> 01:45:03,080
Is it true, Mr. Commissioner?

1780
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:07,080
Absolutely true.

1781
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:10,000
No, madam. Please don't cry.

1782
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:12,830
Vishwas is always worried about you.

1783
01:45:13,330 --> 01:45:14,330
Please don't worry.

1784
01:45:14,830 --> 01:45:16,330
Everything will be alright.

1785
01:45:16,830 --> 01:45:18,700
Goddess.

1786
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:23,750
Let my Vishwas be successful in his mission.

1787
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:26,250
We've to foil Vishwas' mission at any cost.

1788
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:28,450
We should stop him from committing anymore crime.

1789
01:45:28,950 --> 01:45:30,500
You said he's joined some gang.

1790
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,120
What can we possibly do now?

1791
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:36,870
We should do something to foil the entire gang's mission.

1792
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:38,700
And Vishwas gets the credit for it.

1793
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:40,750
And he becomes a hero in the view of the law.

1794
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:42,330
Hero?

1795
01:45:42,830 --> 01:45:45,620
To be the hero one needs to kill the villain.

1796
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:46,790
Tell me one thing..

1797
01:45:47,290 --> 01:45:48,330
In his film.. - What?

1798
01:45:48,830 --> 01:45:52,330
Sorry. Who's the villain in his story?

1799
01:46:00,410 --> 01:46:01,330
Yes!

1800
01:46:01,830 --> 01:46:02,620
Napoleon sir.

1801
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:05,450
I've configured this just like you wanted me to.

1802
01:46:05,950 --> 01:46:08,040
Ready to go. - Very good.

1803
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:11,620
Ready to...go.

1804
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:13,040
Relax, gentlemen.

1805
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:14,910
Relax.

1806
01:46:15,410 --> 01:46:19,080
He knew too much about our mission White Elephant.

1807
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:21,790
I don't take chances.

1808
01:46:22,290 --> 01:46:23,580
Now I'm ready.

1809
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:26,870
Ready to tighten the noose around Mumbai's neck.

1810
01:46:27,370 --> 01:46:28,950
As soon as I wring Mumbai's neck..

1811
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:32,370
..entire India will scream.

1812
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:35,500
Your organization's motive will be fulfilled soon.

1813
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,950
And what if you fail?

1814
01:46:38,450 --> 01:46:41,950
Remember, you can deceive the Indian Police..

1815
01:46:42,450 --> 01:46:44,450
..but not us.

1816
01:46:44,950 --> 01:46:48,540
You know what we can..

1817
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:50,500
..and are capable of doing.

1818
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,870
Escaped convict inspector Yashwant Rao.

1819
01:46:56,370 --> 01:47:00,950
You shouldn't utter the name of the dead.

1820
01:47:01,450 --> 01:47:05,040
Napoleon always completes his mission.

1821
01:47:05,540 --> 01:47:08,080
Everyone knows that in our world.

1822
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:13,290
Transfer the money in my account.

1823
01:47:13,790 --> 01:47:17,450
Goodbye.

1824
01:47:17,950 --> 01:47:20,120
What's wrong, sir? You called for me urgently.

1825
01:47:20,620 --> 01:47:23,290
You know her? - Hello.

1826
01:47:23,790 --> 01:47:25,660
You? Who are you?

1827
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:28,200
Well done! Bravo, son!

1828
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:30,830
Today you refuse to recognise my daughter.

1829
01:47:31,330 --> 01:47:33,040
But I hope you recognise me.

1830
01:47:33,540 --> 01:47:34,910
Thakur Joginder Singh.

1831
01:47:35,410 --> 01:47:36,200
Who are they, sir?

1832
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:38,080
Let's kill him, father.. - Let's kidnap him, father.

1833
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:39,950
Shut up you fool.

1834
01:47:40,450 --> 01:47:42,910
Do you want to make your sister a widow?

1835
01:47:43,410 --> 01:47:45,870
Have you thought what we'll tell Manglu?

1836
01:47:46,370 --> 01:47:49,000
Manglu? Who's Manglu? - I don't know, sir.

1837
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:50,620
Let's kill him, father.. - Let's kidnap him, father..

1838
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:53,290
Quiet. We'll kill him, we'll kidnap him.

1839
01:47:53,790 --> 01:47:57,910
But for now, we're here to talk marriage.

1840
01:47:58,410 --> 01:47:59,370
Stop that, Priest.

1841
01:47:59,870 --> 01:48:01,790
He's right. Don't waste it.

1842
01:48:02,290 --> 01:48:03,830
Now he'll convince the groom.

1843
01:48:04,330 --> 01:48:06,330
Uncle Gundu. - Gundu?

1844
01:48:06,830 --> 01:48:09,160
Yes, you. Convince him or we'll call the police.

1845
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:12,580
Give me your phone. - No police. No police.

1846
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:13,950
It must be telepathy, the police are already here.

1847
01:48:14,450 --> 01:48:17,330
Lovely India, dear. - Sir, you called me urgently.

1848
01:48:17,830 --> 01:48:20,120
Who are they? - Kajal? You here?

1849
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:22,370
Thank God, at least you recognised me.

1850
01:48:22,870 --> 01:48:25,250
Do you know her? - Yes. She's complaint Kajal.

1851
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:27,370
She always comes to the police station with a complaint.

1852
01:48:27,870 --> 01:48:28,750
I've a complaint today as well.

1853
01:48:29,250 --> 01:48:31,120
Who's it about? - Him.

1854
01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:34,750
He loved me. We sung duets.

1855
01:48:35,250 --> 01:48:40,540
He promised to marry me. And.. - No.

1856
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:44,660
No, dear. Don't get into too much detail.

1857
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:47,450
You've already lost your honour.

1858
01:48:47,950 --> 01:48:50,200
Now think about your father.

1859
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:52,330
Sir, they're all lying.

1860
01:48:52,830 --> 01:48:54,540
Let's kill him, father.. - Let's kidnap him, father.

1861
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:56,080
Shut up you fool.

1862
01:48:56,580 --> 01:49:01,790
If we kill him, what are we going to tell Manglu? - Manglu?

1863
01:49:02,290 --> 01:49:03,870
Who's Manglu? - I don't know, Gundappa sir.

1864
01:49:04,370 --> 01:49:06,080
Let's kill him, father.. - Let's kidnap him, father.

1865
01:49:06,580 --> 01:49:07,950
Violence again!

1866
01:49:08,450 --> 01:49:09,870
Small mouth, big moustache.

1867
01:49:10,370 --> 01:49:14,120
If we kill him, what are we going to tell Manglu?

1868
01:49:14,620 --> 01:49:15,500
Just a minute.

1869
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,620
Who is Manglu?

1870
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:21,790
You don't know about Manglu, sir? - No, I don't.

1871
01:49:22,290 --> 01:49:23,290
Manglu. Little son.

1872
01:49:23,790 --> 01:49:25,620
Vishwas' little son. Still to be born.

1873
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:27,750
He's still in my daughter's womb.

1874
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:28,910
Manglu. Hold this, son.

1875
01:49:29,410 --> 01:49:30,950
Vishwas. What is this?

1876
01:49:31,450 --> 01:49:32,540
I don't know, sir. This is not mine.

1877
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:34,500
Shut up. Come here.

1878
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,290
Come here. Come here. Look. Napoleon sir's arriving tonight.

1879
01:49:39,790 --> 01:49:42,750
If they mess up anything, then we'll be dead.

1880
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:45,500
Just tell me clearly. If you don't know them..

1881
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,200
..I'll kill them right now and bury them here.

1882
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:49,370
Now tell me clearly.

1883
01:49:49,870 --> 01:49:53,370
Did you have any relation with this girl?

1884
01:49:57,200 --> 01:49:58,370
A little.

1885
01:49:58,870 --> 01:50:02,370
Just a little?

1886
01:50:04,750 --> 01:50:06,660
A little more.

1887
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:10,790
Oh God..

1888
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:15,580
Look. I've convinced Vishwas for the marriage. - Thank God.

1889
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:18,370
Stop that, Priest. Or I will shoot you.

1890
01:50:18,870 --> 01:50:21,410
I just convinced him for now.

1891
01:50:21,910 --> 01:50:23,750
Look. We've an important job to do.

1892
01:50:24,250 --> 01:50:25,830
We'll first finish that job and then the wedding.

1893
01:50:26,330 --> 01:50:28,660
That's called justice.

1894
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:31,370
His Majesty's justice.

1895
01:50:31,870 --> 01:50:34,750
I won't say it! I won't say it! I won't say it!

1896
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:37,040
You'll have to say it, sir! Right, sir?

1897
01:50:37,540 --> 01:50:39,540
What, sir? Tell him what he has to say.

1898
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:43,750
He'll say it. - Sir, you'll have to make up an excuse..

1899
01:50:44,250 --> 01:50:46,950
..and divert the coast guards at Gorai tonight.

1900
01:50:47,450 --> 01:50:51,080
Okay?

1901
01:50:51,580 --> 01:50:52,910
I will shoot you, sir.

1902
01:50:53,410 --> 01:50:55,200
I won't say it even if you shoot me.

1903
01:50:55,700 --> 01:50:58,950
You're refusing us? I will cut off your nose.

1904
01:50:59,450 --> 01:51:00,870
No, not my nose.

1905
01:51:01,370 --> 01:51:03,540
Then I'll cut off your tongue.

1906
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:06,620
If you do that, how will I speak? - Yeah.

1907
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:08,250
You will say it, won't you - Of course I will.

1908
01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:09,910
I will. I will.

1909
01:51:10,410 --> 01:51:12,540
I will do just as you say.

1910
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:14,830
Take some lessons, Ghorpade.

1911
01:51:15,330 --> 01:51:17,040
Take some lessons from him. - Yes, sir.

1912
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:20,290
God bless you.

1913
01:51:20,790 --> 01:51:22,080
Sir. You asked for a knife.

1914
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:23,870
Here's the knife. - Thank you.

1915
01:51:24,370 --> 01:51:26,410
But, sir. You've diverted the police.

1916
01:51:26,910 --> 01:51:27,910
How will they catch Napoleon now?

1917
01:51:28,410 --> 01:51:29,700
We don't catch Napoleon tonight.

1918
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:33,080
We've to catch Napoleon tonight. - No worry.

1919
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:35,660
Even if the police manage to catch Napoleon..

1920
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:38,500
..we won't find his other agents in India.

1921
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:42,540
We'll prove that capturing Napoleon was Vishwas' plan.

1922
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:45,290
Yes. - And Vishwas' crimes will be pardoned.

1923
01:51:45,790 --> 01:51:47,000
Then he'll become a hero tomorrow. - Yes.

1924
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:48,160
Not tomorrow, but the day-after..

1925
01:51:48,660 --> 01:51:49,830
..we'll arrest Napoleon, his entire gang..

1926
01:51:50,330 --> 01:51:52,290
..and all his agents red-handed.

1927
01:51:52,790 --> 01:51:56,290
Wow! What a plan, sir.

1928
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:22,080
Napoleon! Surrender yourself.

1929
01:52:37,950 --> 01:52:40,370
One year of hard work..

1930
01:52:40,870 --> 01:52:43,790
..was foiled in a single night.

1931
01:52:44,290 --> 01:52:47,450
All because of one traitor.

1932
01:52:47,950 --> 01:52:50,830
Who is it?

1933
01:52:51,330 --> 01:52:53,750
Who is it?

1934
01:52:54,250 --> 01:52:55,950
Who is the traitor amongst you..

1935
01:52:56,450 --> 01:52:57,500
..that informed the police?

1936
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,620
The police...arrived their coincidentally, sir.

1937
01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:04,700
It was no coincidence!

1938
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:08,250
They came prepared.

1939
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:11,750
Thank God I managed to save this bag.

1940
01:53:12,250 --> 01:53:15,330
Otherwise, everything would've been over.

1941
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:17,830
This mission can't be completed..

1942
01:53:18,330 --> 01:53:21,750
..without this bag.

1943
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:24,330
Find that traitor.

1944
01:53:24,830 --> 01:53:27,080
Otherwise, I will kill all of you.

1945
01:53:27,580 --> 01:53:29,870
Sir.

1946
01:53:30,370 --> 01:53:33,870
I doubt someone.

1947
01:53:35,950 --> 01:53:38,450
You doubt me? Me?

1948
01:53:38,950 --> 01:53:41,200
I could've been arrested as well.

1949
01:53:41,700 --> 01:53:44,000
I could've died in the police firing as well.

1950
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:45,660
How could you forget Gundappa sir..

1951
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:47,870
..who risked his life to bring you that CD?

1952
01:53:48,370 --> 01:53:50,660
Me.

1953
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:52,500
I had to kill two policemen and I didn't hesitate..

1954
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,540
..just for your CD, Gundappa sir.

1955
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:58,660
But you still doubt me.

1956
01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:02,660
Me!

1957
01:54:04,370 --> 01:54:06,000
Hello, aunt.

1958
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:08,790
You here? - Yes.

1959
01:54:09,290 --> 01:54:10,500
These goons abducted you too.

1960
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,160
They can't abduct me.

1961
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:15,160
I came here willingly. - What?

1962
01:54:15,660 --> 01:54:18,080
And that day, I brought your truck safe and sound..

1963
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:20,410
..from the warehouse!

1964
01:54:20,910 --> 01:54:24,450
And also brought your enemy Khare.

1965
01:54:24,950 --> 01:54:28,450
But you still..

1966
01:54:31,790 --> 01:54:35,620
My son's doing a good job here. - Good job?

1967
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:39,290
Did you join the gang along with your son?

1968
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:43,330
If you still don't trust me..

1969
01:54:43,830 --> 01:54:45,290
Then it's better that I die.

1970
01:54:45,790 --> 01:54:47,500
Then it's better that I die.

1971
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:52,450
My son's working for the police.

1972
01:54:52,950 --> 01:54:53,830
Police!

1973
01:54:54,330 --> 01:54:56,370
But, Gundappa sir..

1974
01:54:56,870 --> 01:54:59,700
..I don't want you to shed innocent blood.

1975
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:02,410
That's why I'm going to kill myself.

1976
01:55:02,910 --> 01:55:04,120
Give me the gun.

1977
01:55:04,620 --> 01:55:07,120
Give me the gun. Give me the gun.

1978
01:55:07,620 --> 01:55:09,700
You give it. Give it.

1979
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:13,790
Stop it, Vishwas.

1980
01:55:14,290 --> 01:55:15,950
Gundappa, what do you think?

1981
01:55:16,450 --> 01:55:22,830
Sir. I think it's a sin to doubt this boy.

1982
01:55:23,330 --> 01:55:24,330
Sorry, Vishwas.

1983
01:55:24,830 --> 01:55:25,540
Boys, come back.

1984
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:29,540
Go. Go.

1985
01:55:31,250 --> 01:55:33,660
Sorry. Sorry. - It's okay.

1986
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:35,950
Sorry, Vishwas.

1987
01:55:36,450 --> 01:55:39,370
I'm really sorry. Forgive me.

1988
01:55:39,870 --> 01:55:41,330
It was a mistake. - Its okay.

1989
01:55:41,830 --> 01:55:43,700
No problem. Go.

1990
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:47,370
Don't drive me away. - I'm not angry.

1991
01:55:47,870 --> 01:55:51,080
I am sending you with happiness. Happy, happy.

1992
01:55:51,580 --> 01:55:53,620
Go, go, goodbye.

1993
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:54,830
Mom just told me.

1994
01:55:55,330 --> 01:55:58,580
I don't care what your mom said to you.

1995
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:00,450
Your mom said that the police..

1996
01:56:00,950 --> 01:56:03,160
Don't try to threaten me.

1997
01:56:03,660 --> 01:56:05,790
I cannot marry you. - What?

1998
01:56:06,290 --> 01:56:08,500
I've things to do for uncle Gundu.

1999
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,250
Learn, Ghorpade. Learn from him. He's our benefactor.

2000
01:56:11,750 --> 01:56:16,450
He's our God.

2001
01:56:16,950 --> 01:56:20,330
How much longer are you going to fool that stupid Gundu?

2002
01:56:20,830 --> 01:56:21,790
Your mom has told me everything..

2003
01:56:22,290 --> 01:56:25,040
..that you're working for the police.

2004
01:56:25,540 --> 01:56:28,120
You're fooling everyone here. - No.

2005
01:56:28,620 --> 01:56:30,370
Now, together we'll apprehend the entire gang.

2006
01:56:30,870 --> 01:56:33,870
Yahoo! - See. I am right.

2007
01:56:34,370 --> 01:56:35,500
Why are you quiet? Say something.

2008
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,660
Now it's their turn to say.

2009
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:41,540
Come on.

2010
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:45,540
The boss has called you. - Come.

2011
01:56:49,910 --> 01:56:52,370
Hello. Hello. We're caught now, Kajal.

2012
01:56:52,870 --> 01:56:55,040
Only God can save us from Napoleon's wrath now.

2013
01:56:55,540 --> 01:56:59,700
The one who listens to me, protect my honor.

2014
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:01,700
Gundappa. What've you got to say now?

2015
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:05,250
Sir, it'll be a sin to trust this boy.

2016
01:57:05,750 --> 01:57:08,450
I want to shoot him. - Enough.

2017
01:57:08,950 --> 01:57:10,580
Do you two have anything to say? - Yes.

2018
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:12,540
I'm very, very sorry sir. - Hey!

2019
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:14,540
I mean, we're very, very sorry sir.

2020
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:15,950
We made a mistake.

2021
01:57:16,450 --> 01:57:17,540
I didn't know there was a camera up there.

2022
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:20,250
Otherwise, I wouldn't have said what I did.

2023
01:57:20,750 --> 01:57:25,250
Lovely India. The adorable couple together.

2024
01:57:25,750 --> 01:57:26,660
And in the Yoga pose.

2025
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:29,160
Stop it, Guruji. - Why should I?

2026
01:57:29,660 --> 01:57:31,870
We've already fooled uncle Gundu..

2027
01:57:32,370 --> 01:57:34,450
Now there's going to be celebrations.

2028
01:57:34,950 --> 01:57:36,410
Singing and dancing.

2029
01:57:36,910 --> 01:57:37,750
Stop this charade.

2030
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:41,370
Shut up!

2031
01:57:41,870 --> 01:57:44,370
Why didn't you tell me?

2032
01:57:44,870 --> 01:57:47,410
Who's this new character, Jackie Shroff type?

2033
01:57:47,910 --> 01:57:51,790
Boys. Ready to fire!

2034
01:57:52,290 --> 01:57:57,540
Sir...I've one last wish...before I die.

2035
01:57:58,040 --> 01:57:59,870
What?

2036
01:58:00,370 --> 01:58:03,120
I want to hear the 'Gayatri Mantra' before I die.

2037
01:58:03,620 --> 01:58:05,500
Where do we get the 'Gayatri Mantra' from?

2038
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:09,160
I have it, sir. I have it. On my phone.

2039
01:58:09,660 --> 01:58:11,620
See. You can hear it too.

2040
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:13,330
It'll wash away some of your sins.

2041
01:58:13,830 --> 01:58:16,160
And we'll leave this world.

2042
01:58:16,660 --> 01:58:19,040
Fine, fine, hurry up. - Thank you, sir. Thank you.

2043
01:58:19,540 --> 01:58:21,120
Come on, everyone close your eyes.

2044
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:23,080
We're going to die anyway, why close our..

2045
01:58:23,580 --> 01:58:24,660
Just close your eyes!

2046
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:28,660
Shut your eyes.

2047
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:33,200
What is happening? - Why can't I see?

2048
01:58:33,700 --> 01:58:35,870
Don't shoot me.

2049
01:58:36,370 --> 01:58:37,250
Open your eyes. - Why?

2050
01:58:37,750 --> 01:58:39,580
Close the doors. Don't let them run.

2051
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:41,580
Run!

2052
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:43,750
Come on, quickly.

2053
01:58:44,250 --> 01:58:45,500
I won't let you go. I will catch you.

2054
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,620
Caught one, sir. - Idiot, this is my hand.

2055
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:50,200
Hey, here.. here.. here.

2056
01:58:50,700 --> 01:58:52,540
Close the doors.

2057
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:55,160
That way. - Sir, caught one.

2058
01:58:55,660 --> 01:58:58,160
It's me again. - It is you. - Sorry, sir.

2059
01:58:58,660 --> 01:59:00,500
Where is everyone?

2060
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,370
Close the door on the left.

2061
01:59:03,870 --> 01:59:05,200
That's the shortcut.

2062
01:59:05,700 --> 01:59:06,950
Left! Left!

2063
01:59:07,450 --> 01:59:08,250
Where are you going?

2064
01:59:08,750 --> 01:59:11,540
Where are you going? How will you run away like that?

2065
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:13,540
I can see everything.

2066
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:19,250
Vishwas! Stay there. Stay there.

2067
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:21,120
They escaped.

2068
01:59:21,620 --> 01:59:23,040
Don't just stand there, find them.

2069
01:59:23,540 --> 01:59:25,500
They took my bag too. - Which bag, sir?

2070
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,450
My bag's essential for my mission.

2071
01:59:28,950 --> 01:59:33,250
Go. Get Vishwas' mother and Khare. - Yes, sir.

2072
01:59:33,750 --> 01:59:35,250
Dog!

2073
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:37,450
Who kept the door open?

2074
01:59:37,950 --> 01:59:40,410
He escaped.

2075
01:59:40,910 --> 01:59:42,620
He took the mother along.

2076
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:43,870
Sir, he's written something here.

2077
01:59:44,370 --> 01:59:45,450
So read it.

2078
01:59:45,950 --> 01:59:47,830
"The food here is really pathetic."

2079
01:59:48,330 --> 01:59:51,080
"Please change the cook, Joint Commissioner Khare."

2080
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:53,700
Fool. - No, sir. He's absolutely right.

2081
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:55,160
I've complained about this too.

2082
01:59:55,660 --> 01:59:59,160
The food's really pathetic. - Shut up!

2083
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:12,500
Sir. - Yes. - Inspector reporting, sir.

2084
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:13,620
What's the news?

2085
02:00:14,120 --> 02:00:15,500
Gundappa's den is empty, sir. - What?

2086
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,120
They've fled. - Keep informing.

2087
02:00:17,620 --> 02:00:21,120
Yes, sir.

2088
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:25,120
This isn't cocaine, sir. - What?

2089
02:00:25,620 --> 02:00:26,700
It's powder.

2090
02:00:27,200 --> 02:00:30,700
Are you sure? - 100% sure, sir.

2091
02:00:35,790 --> 02:00:36,450
Yes, Vishwas. Where are you?

2092
02:00:36,950 --> 02:00:39,410
Sir, we've escaped from Gundappa's den. - Very good.

2093
02:00:39,910 --> 02:00:40,700
We've escaped too.

2094
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:42,410
And mom? - She's fine.

2095
02:00:42,910 --> 02:00:44,700
And Kajal? I sent Kajal to meet up with you.

2096
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:46,370
Yes, she's here too.

2097
02:00:46,870 --> 02:00:49,250
She's with your mother. Both are under police protection.

2098
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:50,500
Listen to me.

2099
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,200
Napoleon's tricked us.

2100
02:00:52,700 --> 02:00:54,250
That truck wasn't filled with cocaine.

2101
02:00:54,750 --> 02:00:55,700
It was some bogus powder.

2102
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:59,500
That means 'Mission White Elephant' is something else.

2103
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,040
Sir, whatever it is, it's in a black bag.

2104
02:01:02,540 --> 02:01:05,000
And that black bag's with me. - Very good.

2105
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:08,950
Get that bag to Crime Branch Special Unit Zone 8!

2106
02:01:09,450 --> 02:01:12,950
That's where I am. - Yes, sir.

2107
02:01:19,830 --> 02:01:23,330
I am not a policeman, but Napoleon's man.

2108
02:01:30,290 --> 02:01:33,540
Hello. - We've abducted your mother.

2109
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:37,700
Get that black bag back to Vasai Fort in one hour.

2110
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:41,370
Once you're there, I'll give you further directions.

2111
02:01:41,870 --> 02:01:45,500
You've only 60 minutes.

2112
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:51,540
If you try to act smart, you will never find your mother again.

2113
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:52,870
Seal the entire city.

2114
02:01:53,370 --> 02:01:55,410
Set up check-posts. - May I come in, sir?

2115
02:01:55,910 --> 02:01:57,500
Come, Vishwas.

2116
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:58,950
Vishwas, there's bad news for you.

2117
02:01:59,450 --> 02:02:00,250
I know, sir.

2118
02:02:00,750 --> 02:02:02,700
Napoleon has kidnapped my mother.

2119
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:04,370
How did you know?

2120
02:02:04,870 --> 02:02:06,450
He just called, sir.

2121
02:02:06,950 --> 02:02:09,660
He said, "If I don't return him this bag in an hour.."

2122
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:12,450
"..he will kill my mother".

2123
02:02:12,950 --> 02:02:14,040
Here, sir.

2124
02:02:14,540 --> 02:02:15,910
Yet you brought this bag here.

2125
02:02:16,410 --> 02:02:20,040
Mom always said, "Duty comes first, relations later".

2126
02:02:20,540 --> 02:02:21,660
So, I've done my duty..

2127
02:02:22,160 --> 02:02:25,660
..now I'm going to save my mother.

2128
02:02:28,330 --> 02:02:30,620
Wait, Vishwas.

2129
02:02:31,120 --> 02:02:34,000
Go give them this bag.

2130
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:38,120
Sir? - I know we lagged in protecting your mother.

2131
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:41,120
But now Mumbai Police will do its best in saving her.

2132
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:42,950
Go. - But, sir, this bag..

2133
02:02:43,450 --> 02:02:44,790
Trust me, we will handle everything.

2134
02:02:45,290 --> 02:02:48,790
Now go fast.

2135
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:53,450
I kept the police engrossed with cocaine.

2136
02:02:53,950 --> 02:02:57,000
And diverted their complete attention on you, Gundappa.

2137
02:02:57,500 --> 02:03:02,120
And quietly, cleverly fixed bio-chemical weapons..

2138
02:03:02,620 --> 02:03:05,450
..at four important places in the city.

2139
02:03:05,950 --> 02:03:07,370
That's my real mission.

2140
02:03:07,870 --> 02:03:10,200
Mission White Elephant.

2141
02:03:10,700 --> 02:03:14,200
Bio-chemical blast!

2142
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:19,580
An RDX blast kills only those that are in proximity.

2143
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:22,290
But a bio-chemical blast will also kill those...

2144
02:03:22,790 --> 02:03:25,160
...who are safe in their homes.

2145
02:03:25,660 --> 02:03:27,950
Because bio-chemical is a liquid.

2146
02:03:28,450 --> 02:03:30,620
It will turn into gas right after the blast.

2147
02:03:31,120 --> 02:03:36,620
And spread a dangerous, incurable disease through air.

2148
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:40,620
In the entire city.

2149
02:03:55,790 --> 02:03:59,290
Your son, my enemy's here.

2150
02:04:02,540 --> 02:04:04,500
Savitri?

2151
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:09,000
You...are still alive.

2152
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:12,540
That means...

2153
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:16,290
Vishwas..

2154
02:04:16,790 --> 02:04:18,500
I...

2155
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,540
I looked everywhere for you, Savitri.

2156
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:23,370
You're dead for us. - No.

2157
02:04:23,870 --> 02:04:25,450
No.

2158
02:04:25,950 --> 02:04:27,910
Don't say that, Savitri.

2159
02:04:28,410 --> 02:04:30,080
Look, once again we're..

2160
02:04:30,580 --> 02:04:36,000
You, me and our son.. - Mine.

2161
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:38,080
Vishwas is my son.

2162
02:04:38,580 --> 02:04:40,750
Only mine.

2163
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:43,330
You've no relation with me.

2164
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:45,660
I do, Savitri.

2165
02:04:46,160 --> 02:04:49,040
We share blood ties.

2166
02:04:49,540 --> 02:04:53,040
And even you can't change that.

2167
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:19,790
You've the bag, Gundappa sir.

2168
02:05:20,290 --> 02:05:22,450
You can punish me in any way you want.

2169
02:05:22,950 --> 02:05:23,660
But let my mother go.

2170
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:26,410
First let us complete our mission.

2171
02:05:26,910 --> 02:05:29,790
Mission White Elephant.

2172
02:05:30,290 --> 02:05:34,660
This bag contains a computerized detonator.

2173
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:37,910
Once it's connected with our computer..

2174
02:05:38,410 --> 02:05:41,700
..it will trigger numerous blasts in the city.

2175
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:44,500
And people will rot to death.

2176
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,500
Rot to death!

2177
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:56,580
Yes. Take a left after one kilometre.

2178
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:18,500
Take a right after three kilometres.

2179
02:06:34,790 --> 02:06:38,250
Sir. I've set the timer for the bio-chemical weapon.

2180
02:06:38,750 --> 02:06:40,910
I've the set the timer to 20 minutes.

2181
02:06:41,410 --> 02:06:44,910
All the bombs will explode in 20 minutes.

2182
02:07:02,910 --> 02:07:04,250
What happened to the tracker?

2183
02:07:04,750 --> 02:07:06,580
Just a minute, stop!

2184
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:07,790
You informed the police.

2185
02:07:08,290 --> 02:07:12,370
Now you and your mother will have to die, Vishwas! - Gundappa!

2186
02:07:12,870 --> 02:07:14,370
No one moves.

2187
02:07:14,870 --> 02:07:16,120
Or I will shoot.

2188
02:07:16,620 --> 02:07:19,370
Shoot me.

2189
02:07:19,870 --> 02:07:21,120
Don't move.

2190
02:07:21,620 --> 02:07:22,790
I said...

2191
02:07:23,290 --> 02:07:24,080
I will shoot.

2192
02:07:24,580 --> 02:07:26,750
Shoot me.

2193
02:07:27,250 --> 02:07:30,540
That's the punishment for a sinner like me..

2194
02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:34,410
..that I die..

2195
02:07:34,910 --> 02:07:35,950
...by the hands of my son.

2196
02:07:36,450 --> 02:07:37,410
What is this nonsense?

2197
02:07:37,910 --> 02:07:40,290
Fate..

2198
02:07:40,790 --> 02:07:43,580
..has played a joke on me, son.

2199
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:46,660
I..

2200
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:51,500
Savitri.. - Don't utter my mom's name.

2201
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:57,200
My father died when I was a kid. - That was a charade.

2202
02:07:57,700 --> 02:08:01,200
I can't believe my eyes either.

2203
02:08:03,910 --> 02:08:08,290
After all these years..

2204
02:08:08,790 --> 02:08:10,700
Ghorpade. - Sir.

2205
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:14,120
Switch on the monitor.

2206
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:18,080
"You're still alive.."

2207
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:22,290
"That means...

2208
02:08:22,790 --> 02:08:26,950
...Vishwas.."

2209
02:08:27,450 --> 02:08:31,120
"I searched...

2210
02:08:31,620 --> 02:08:35,120
..everywhere for you, Savitri."

2211
02:08:38,450 --> 02:08:40,500
Father..

2212
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:44,500
Give me a hug, son.

2213
02:08:46,660 --> 02:08:48,830
I've yearned so long for this.

2214
02:08:49,330 --> 02:08:51,410
I don't want anything else.

2215
02:08:51,910 --> 02:08:54,200
Just stop the police.

2216
02:08:54,700 --> 02:08:59,120
I will go with you and surrender myself.

2217
02:08:59,620 --> 02:09:01,250
So that you become famous.

2218
02:09:01,750 --> 02:09:04,330
My son becomes famous.

2219
02:09:04,830 --> 02:09:08,330
That's my request. That's all.

2220
02:09:10,870 --> 02:09:12,000
I want additional forces.

2221
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:14,370
Send the backup immediately.

2222
02:09:14,870 --> 02:09:16,120
Vishwas.

2223
02:09:16,620 --> 02:09:19,040
Yes, Vishwas.

2224
02:09:19,540 --> 02:09:23,790
Sir, Napoleon's ready to surrender. - What?

2225
02:09:24,290 --> 02:09:26,450
Stay there.

2226
02:09:26,950 --> 02:09:28,450
I'm bringing him to you.

2227
02:09:28,950 --> 02:09:32,200
OK.

2228
02:09:32,700 --> 02:09:34,120
Thank you, son.

2229
02:09:34,620 --> 02:09:36,450
Thank you!

2230
02:09:36,950 --> 02:09:42,660
I...missed you a lot, father.

2231
02:09:43,160 --> 02:09:47,330
Why did you leave me?

2232
02:09:47,830 --> 02:09:48,660
I am sorry, son.

2233
02:09:49,160 --> 02:09:51,500
I am sorry, I made a big mistake.

2234
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,500
I made a big mistake.

2235
02:09:58,040 --> 02:09:59,950
Sir, you're a fantastic actor.

2236
02:10:00,450 --> 02:10:02,790
Even I was deceived for a moment.

2237
02:10:03,290 --> 02:10:04,500
Just imagine, sir. Even me.

2238
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,540
Hello, Captain. Keep the chopper ready.

2239
02:10:07,040 --> 02:10:07,700
I'm arriving in an hour. - OK.

2240
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:09,370
Right now.

2241
02:10:09,870 --> 02:10:10,700
Get ready to leave. - Yes, sir.

2242
02:10:11,200 --> 02:10:13,200
Gundappa. - I am coming.

2243
02:10:13,700 --> 02:10:16,620
I..

2244
02:10:17,120 --> 02:10:18,250
What's wrong with him?

2245
02:10:18,750 --> 02:10:24,330
Sir, there's another one there.

2246
02:10:24,830 --> 02:10:28,330
Sir, there another one.

2247
02:10:35,450 --> 02:10:37,080
Hey girl. What are you doing?

2248
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:38,450
Nothing much.

2249
02:10:38,950 --> 02:10:40,330
I just deactivated all the bombs..

2250
02:10:40,830 --> 02:10:43,290
..that Gundappa sir had activated.

2251
02:10:43,790 --> 02:10:46,950
That's it. - How did she come out?

2252
02:10:47,450 --> 02:10:50,080
I brought her out, papa. For helping me.

2253
02:10:50,580 --> 02:10:53,080
But, I..

2254
02:10:53,580 --> 02:10:54,250
Vishwas?

2255
02:10:54,750 --> 02:10:58,080
You might be my father..

2256
02:10:58,580 --> 02:11:02,910
..but I'm a better actor than you.

2257
02:11:03,410 --> 02:11:06,040
You put up a charade..

2258
02:11:06,540 --> 02:11:09,580
..so that you can cause blasts in the city and flee.

2259
02:11:10,080 --> 02:11:11,540
And I put up a charade, so that..

2260
02:11:12,040 --> 02:11:18,120
..I can stop the blasts and apprehend everyone.

2261
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:20,910
So, Napoleon. How was it?

2262
02:11:21,410 --> 02:11:24,910
Cool!

2263
02:11:26,620 --> 02:11:27,830
You won't survive either, son.

2264
02:11:28,330 --> 02:11:31,700
Hands up! Don't move.

2265
02:11:32,200 --> 02:11:33,660
Throw down your weapons.

2266
02:11:34,160 --> 02:11:35,500
We already did, sir. - What?

2267
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,160
You already did? - I made them do it, sir.

2268
02:11:38,660 --> 02:11:41,250
Very good, Vishwas. Very, very good.

2269
02:11:41,750 --> 02:11:42,870
Very, very bad.

2270
02:11:43,370 --> 02:11:44,620
Because I still have my weapon.

2271
02:11:45,120 --> 02:11:47,870
Come on, Commissioner. Throw down your weapon.

2272
02:11:48,370 --> 02:11:49,450
Throw it.

2273
02:11:49,950 --> 02:11:50,830
Yes. Yes.

2274
02:11:51,330 --> 02:11:55,910
And, Vishwas. Throw down your gun too.

2275
02:11:56,410 --> 02:11:58,160
Very good, Gundappa.

2276
02:11:58,660 --> 02:11:59,330
Very good. - You see, sir.

2277
02:11:59,830 --> 02:12:03,330
This commissioner's always out to get me.

2278
02:12:31,870 --> 02:12:34,080
Hang on. - What happened?

2279
02:12:34,580 --> 02:12:38,080
Take this. Take this. Take this. Take this.

2280
02:13:24,410 --> 02:13:27,910
Help!

2281
02:13:34,700 --> 02:13:36,910
Save me! Save me!

2282
02:13:37,410 --> 02:13:40,910
Save me!

2283
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:48,540
Ghorpade! - Yes, sir.

2284
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:50,500
What sir?

2285
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:54,500
You dare hit a policeman.

2286
02:14:00,120 --> 02:14:01,750
What are you doing, idiot?

2287
02:14:02,250 --> 02:14:04,450
Are you crazy?

2288
02:14:04,950 --> 02:14:08,450
Oh gosh!

2289
02:14:31,580 --> 02:14:35,910
Oh my! Do you want to kill me?

2290
02:14:36,410 --> 02:14:37,540
You..

2291
02:14:38,040 --> 02:14:39,000
Ghorpade.

2292
02:14:39,500 --> 02:14:40,790
Kill him. - OK, sir.

2293
02:14:41,290 --> 02:14:42,200
Ghorpade. - Yes, sir.

2294
02:14:42,700 --> 02:14:43,750
He's a policeman.

2295
02:14:44,250 --> 02:14:45,250
Kill him. - Yes, sir.

2296
02:14:45,750 --> 02:14:46,580
Ghorpade. - Yes, sir.

2297
02:14:47,080 --> 02:14:49,200
He's one of us, kill him. - Yes, sir.

2298
02:14:49,700 --> 02:14:50,870
Ghorpade. - Yes, sir.

2299
02:14:51,370 --> 02:14:52,120
Who do you work for?

2300
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:53,410
For you, sir. - Then?

2301
02:14:53,910 --> 02:14:54,620
Ghorpade. - Yes, sir.

2302
02:14:55,120 --> 02:14:57,250
Who pays you? - You do, sir.

2303
02:14:57,750 --> 02:14:58,870
Ghorpade. - Yes, sir.

2304
02:14:59,370 --> 02:15:01,080
What uniform do you wear? - The police uniform, sir.

2305
02:15:01,580 --> 02:15:03,200
Ghorpade. - Yes, sir.

2306
02:15:03,700 --> 02:15:06,080
Who pays for your innerwear? - You do, sir.

2307
02:15:06,580 --> 02:15:07,790
Ghorpade. - Yes, sir.

2308
02:15:08,290 --> 02:15:10,370
Traitor. - Disloyal.

2309
02:15:10,870 --> 02:15:13,540
Double-crosser. - Two-timer.

2310
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:15,500
Sir, did I do the right thing?

2311
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:17,750
Serves people like him right.

2312
02:15:18,250 --> 02:15:21,750
All the best. - Same to you.

2313
02:16:21,200 --> 02:16:24,700
No!

2314
02:16:46,700 --> 02:16:51,790
Catch him.

2315
02:16:52,290 --> 02:16:53,450
Where am I? - Ghorpade.

2316
02:16:53,950 --> 02:16:57,120
Yes, sir. - Come here.

2317
02:16:57,620 --> 02:17:01,120
Where's Napoleon?

2318
02:17:11,660 --> 02:17:15,040
And this way, Vishwas Rao has set an example..

2319
02:17:15,540 --> 02:17:21,000
..by getting his father arrested.

2320
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:23,500
And soon, after completing his training..

2321
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,660
..he will join the Mumbai Police Force. - Yes.

2322
02:17:27,160 --> 02:17:28,410
And on behalf of the government..

2323
02:17:28,910 --> 02:17:31,120
..Vishwas Rao will be presented with the Bravery Award.

2324
02:17:31,620 --> 02:17:35,120
Vishwas Rao.

2325
02:18:23,580 --> 02:18:25,500
Congratulations. - Thank you, sir.

2326
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,080
Sir..

2327
02:18:28,580 --> 02:18:32,120
I would like my mother to honour me with this award.

2328
02:18:32,620 --> 02:18:33,910
If you.. - Of course.

2329
02:18:34,410 --> 02:18:36,250
Call her.

2330
02:18:36,750 --> 02:18:38,790
I would like to request Vishwas Rao's mother..

2331
02:18:39,290 --> 02:18:42,790
..to come on stage and honour him with this medal.

2332
02:18:53,500 --> 02:18:57,000
Mom.

2333
02:19:23,660 --> 02:19:26,370
Hello. Here.

2334
02:19:26,870 --> 02:19:28,870
Take this.

2335
02:19:29,370 --> 02:19:34,830
"I'll tell the world everything my mom taught me since I was a kid."

2336
02:19:35,330 --> 02:19:40,830
"That day will surely come.."

2337
02:19:41,330 --> 02:19:46,620
"..when you will be proud of me."

2338
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:52,370
"That day will surely come.."

2339
02:19:52,870 --> 02:20:00,660
"That day will surely come.."

2340
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:06,660
"All I want is for you to trust me, forever, mom."

2341
02:20:07,160 --> 02:20:09,370
"Forever.."

2342
02:20:09,870 --> 02:20:14,000
Mom.

2343
02:20:14,500 --> 02:20:18,000
My mom actually deserves this medal.

2344
02:20:18,500 --> 02:20:21,540
Today I'm standing here..

2345
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:25,540
..because of her.

2346
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:29,540
I always wanted to be an actor.

2347
02:20:34,950 --> 02:20:37,200
Today, my mom...

2348
02:20:37,700 --> 02:20:41,910
...made me a real-life hero.

2349
02:20:42,410 --> 02:20:45,120
It took me time to understand..

2350
02:20:45,620 --> 02:20:49,200
..that a real hero..

2351
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:54,080
..works hard for the people.

2352
02:20:54,580 --> 02:20:59,830
Risks his life for the safety of the people.

2353
02:21:00,330 --> 02:21:03,160
Like the police.

2354
02:21:03,660 --> 02:21:07,330
The real hero.

2355
02:21:07,830 --> 02:21:09,910
Thank you, mom.

2356
02:21:10,410 --> 02:21:13,910
Thank you!

2357
02:21:25,660 --> 02:21:26,580
Guruji, you're so late.

2358
02:21:27,080 --> 02:21:29,620
The function's already over. Look, what I got.

2359
02:21:30,120 --> 02:21:31,540
You're on a roll.

2360
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:35,040
Look there. Not that way, this way. Look here.

2361
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:36,580
He's a rich producer Motwani..

2362
02:21:37,080 --> 02:21:38,250
..and wants to sign you as a hero.

2363
02:21:38,750 --> 02:21:40,080
He's got cash and cheque.

2364
02:21:40,580 --> 02:21:42,750
I'm not going to work in films anymore.

2365
02:21:43,250 --> 02:21:44,790
What are you saying? - Yes, Guruji.

2366
02:21:45,290 --> 02:21:46,450
Everything a hero does in films..

2367
02:21:46,950 --> 02:21:48,620
..I did all that in real life.

2368
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:50,580
Mother and son emotion. Father and son clash.

2369
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:52,700
Fighting the villains. Dialogue delivery.

2370
02:21:53,200 --> 02:21:55,000
Romancing the heroine. Dancing with the item-girl.

2371
02:21:55,500 --> 02:21:56,830
I did everything, Guruji.

2372
02:21:57,330 --> 02:21:58,410
Now I'm joining the police force.

2373
02:21:58,910 --> 02:22:01,160
Come, let's go meet mother. - Wait a minute.

2374
02:22:01,660 --> 02:22:03,330
You and your police job.

2375
02:22:03,830 --> 02:22:05,620
Do you know what a hero earns at the end of the day?

2376
02:22:06,120 --> 02:22:08,620
He has cars, bungalows, bank balance.

2377
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:10,870
And what is good about your police job?

2378
02:22:11,370 --> 02:22:14,870
And what will you have in future?

2379
02:22:17,500 --> 02:22:19,370
Mom!

2380
02:22:19,870 --> 02:22:23,370
I'll have my mom!

2381
02:22:26,790 --> 02:22:29,370
Yogi bhai! Yogi bhai! What happened?

2382
02:22:29,870 --> 02:22:31,950
He won't work in films anymore.

2383
02:22:32,450 --> 02:22:34,830
Where are you going? - But why?

2384
02:22:35,330 --> 02:22:36,500
Through the poster emerges the hero.

2385
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,080
Now he's a real life hero.

2386
02:22:39,580 --> 02:22:40,500
He no longer cares about the poster.

2387
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:42,580
But, Yogi bhai, what about us now?

2388
02:22:43,080 --> 02:22:44,950
What? - What about us now?

2389
02:22:45,450 --> 02:22:46,540
Us?

2390
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:48,750
Salman! Shahrukh!

2391
02:22:49,250 --> 02:22:51,120
Hrithik!

2392
02:22:51,620 --> 02:22:55,120
We'll have to settle for one of them.

2393
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:36,200
"The heart's brazen."

2394
02:23:36,700 --> 02:23:39,700
"Doesn't know a thing about shame."

2395
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:43,200
"It's full of fun and attitude."

2396
02:23:43,700 --> 02:23:47,200
"Can't do without flirting."

2397
02:23:54,330 --> 02:23:57,410
"The heart's brazen."

2398
02:23:57,910 --> 02:24:01,000
"Doesn't know a thing about shame."

2399
02:24:01,500 --> 02:24:04,500
"It's full of fun and attitude."

2400
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:08,080
"Can't do without flirting."

2401
02:24:08,580 --> 02:24:11,660
"Hey, Mr. DJ, let nothing stop you."

2402
02:24:12,160 --> 02:24:15,200
"Hey, Mr. DJ, keep playing on."

2403
02:24:15,700 --> 02:24:18,660
"Hey, Mr. DJ, the night's young."

2404
02:24:19,160 --> 02:24:21,370
"Play a nice tune."

2405
02:24:21,870 --> 02:24:28,500
"Let's go bananas, bananas, bananas."

2406
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:35,500
"Let's go bananas, bananas, bananas."

2407
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:39,540
"The story of my love's incomplete."

2408
02:24:40,040 --> 02:24:42,580
"That's why it's completely bananas."

2409
02:24:43,080 --> 02:24:46,580
"Let's go bananas, bananas, bananas."

2410
02:24:58,250 --> 02:25:01,330
"It's my chance to be naughty."

2411
02:25:01,830 --> 02:25:04,500
"To savour those beautiful lips."

2412
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:08,370
"We'll, right here, right now.."

2413
02:25:08,870 --> 02:25:11,830
"..reveal our heart's intentions."

2414
02:25:12,330 --> 02:25:18,500
"The one whose eyes, steal my peace and slumber.."

2415
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:26,080
"..should know that I'm blown away."

2416
02:25:26,580 --> 02:25:29,500
"Hey, Mr. DJ, let nothing stop you."

2417
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:33,120
"Hey, Mr. DJ, keep playing on."

2418
02:25:33,620 --> 02:25:36,660
"Hey, Mr. DJ, the night's young."

2419
02:25:37,160 --> 02:25:42,040
"Play a nice grove."

2420
02:25:42,540 --> 02:25:44,580
"So everyone put your hands together."

2421
02:25:45,080 --> 02:25:51,660
"Let's go bananas, bananas, bananas."

2422
02:25:52,160 --> 02:25:58,830
"Let's go bananas, bananas, bananas."

2423
02:25:59,330 --> 02:26:02,790
"The story of my love's incomplete."

2424
02:26:03,290 --> 02:26:05,950
"That's why it's completely bananas."

2425
02:26:06,450 --> 02:26:14,250
"Let's go bananas, bananas, bananas."

2426
02:26:14,750 --> 02:26:16,000
"Bananas."
