1
00:00:03,014 --> 00:00:05,254
We've little doubt
the cyclamen scanners at

2
00:00:05,334 --> 00:00:08,055
Dover were attacked and
disabled so that the irradiated

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,975
body could be brought into
the country.

4
00:00:10,055 --> 00:00:13,055
- Irradiated body of whom?
- The investigation is ongoing.

5
00:00:13,175 --> 00:00:16,695
But the scale and sophistication
make us certain

6
00:00:16,735 --> 00:00:18,696
that this was
state sponsored.

7
00:00:18,736 --> 00:00:21,456
Russia remaining the prime
suspect -Remaining a suspect.

8
00:00:21,576 --> 00:00:23,416
But there's no smoking gun.

9
00:00:23,536 --> 00:00:27,697
The malware code could viably
point in multiple directions,

10
00:00:27,817 --> 00:00:29,657
and the truck
had been scoured clean

11
00:00:29,777 --> 00:00:31,977
of anything
forensically detectable.

12
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:35,257
We do, however,
have a cause of death.

13
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:38,578
He was force fed Polonium 210.

14
00:00:40,018 --> 00:00:42,258
Russia may be behind this.

15
00:00:42,298 --> 00:00:45,378
But with the backlash around
Jaiyou Energy's drilling and the ship

16
00:00:45,498 --> 00:00:48,219
explosion, the Chinese
are furious with us too.

17
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:51,379
Or it could be misdirection
by another actor entirely.

18
00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:53,099
We don't yet
have anything solid.

19
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:55,979
Whoever did this could
have brought a nuclear bomb

20
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:59,940
into this country
right under our noses.

21
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,900
Instead, they dumped the body of a
murdered man they knew we'd find.

22
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,460
- They're sending a message.
- And as soon as

23
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,941
we've identified the dead man,
we can try to decode it.

24
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:12,821
Maybe deduce who sent
it and for whom.

25
00:01:12,941 --> 00:01:15,101
Then in the meantime
we just sit and wait.

26
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:18,382
Hoping you get a grip
on something solid

27
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:22,662
before this country suffers yet
another attack on Christ knows what.

28
00:01:22,742 --> 00:01:26,182
We will continue to investigate
every possible avenue.

29
00:01:26,262 --> 00:01:28,103
In terms of an attack,

30
00:01:28,183 --> 00:01:32,303
we are facing a significantly
escalated domestic threat.

31
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,303
So I've asked Robert to convene
COBRAt 10.

32
00:01:34,383 --> 00:01:36,303
Which I will be doing.

33
00:01:36,383 --> 00:01:38,944
And you will be attending.

34
00:01:44,024 --> 00:01:46,304
Of course people are angry.
After what we heard

35
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:48,025
about the cyber attack
on Dover last week

36
00:01:48,105 --> 00:01:50,545
it is clear that this country
is under systematic assault

37
00:01:50,585 --> 00:01:52,305
and the public's
lost all trust in this

38
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:54,825
government's ability to keep us
safe or to tell us the truth.

39
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:58,386
Well, speaking of the truth, you crossed
the floor to join Robert Sutherland...

40
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,546
Well, cross the floor
is hardly accurate.

41
00:02:00,586 --> 00:02:02,906
I was advising in a policy
unit and I resigned

42
00:02:02,946 --> 00:02:05,842
because I wanted nothing to do with the
government soaked in the blood of its own people.

43
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:09,707
And the Junction 23 Inquiry with
Lord Singer chosen to conduct it

44
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:12,267
makes an absolute
mockery of accountability.

45
00:02:12,347 --> 00:02:13,867
So you're suggesting
inherent bias?

46
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:15,867
I'm suggesting that if
a government wanted to be

47
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:18,268
exonerated, they couldn't
find someone more reliable to

48
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,388
side with the establishment
against the will of the people,

49
00:02:21,428 --> 00:02:24,388
which makes it hard not to
wonder if Lord Singer's been,

50
00:02:24,428 --> 00:02:27,389
shall we say
singing for his supper.

51
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:32,525
'Cause I wanted nothing to do
with the government soaked in

52
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:33,829
the blood of its own people.

53
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:35,709
An insider blows the whistle.

54
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,406
And the public have lost all
trust in the government's

55
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,310
ability to keep us
safe or to tell us the truth.

56
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,990
We told you the truth,
the government is weak

57
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,550
and venal, a regime
which forced its army

58
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,070
to use live rounds
on its people.

59
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:48,671
And the Junction 23 inquiry

60
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,551
with Lord Singer
chosen to conduct it,

61
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:53,111
makes an absolute
mockery of accountability.

62
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:55,271
They couldn't find someone
more reliable to side with

63
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:57,392
the establishment against
the will of the people.

64
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:59,872
- Saving their own skin.
- Makes it hard not to wonder

65
00:02:59,952 --> 00:03:02,552
if Lord Singer has been,
shall we say,

66
00:03:02,672 --> 00:03:03,832
Singing for his supper.

67
00:03:03,952 --> 00:03:05,872
A government which used

68
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,273
its weapons at J23
to send a message to us.

69
00:03:08,393 --> 00:03:10,713
The people of this nation,
that we should be

70
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:14,553
too afraid to dissent,
to rise up ever again.

71
00:03:14,673 --> 00:03:16,873
But we do not know fear.

72
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:19,674
Only these corrupt
glutted reptiles

73
00:03:19,794 --> 00:03:22,154
will know fear,
for we shall rise up

74
00:03:22,274 --> 00:03:26,554
for justice for our nation,
and teach it to them.

75
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:29,515
These enemies of the people.

76
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:33,795
And where we go,
our brothers will follow.

77
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:53,117
Francine Bridge.

78
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:56,877
Scourge of the Tories,
savior of democracy.

79
00:03:56,957 --> 00:03:59,078
- Future of this nation.
- Okay stop it.

80
00:03:59,118 --> 00:04:02,518
Convert to the heady nectar
of pumpkin spice latte.

81
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:06,398
- You didn't.
- Christ, I'm not a monster, double espresso.

82
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,559
Ever considered you
might have trust issues?

83
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,759
Only with journalists.

84
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,999
Saw you on the television
doing some of that politics.

85
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,320
- What do you think?
- I flipped back to Bake Off.

86
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,520
Hari, I want your opinion,

87
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,520
You were brilliant.

88
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,680
I mean it.

89
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,000
We've been trending.

90
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,641
Even the far right thinks
you're, well, right.

91
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:31,961
- What?
- Your mentions.

92
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:36,521
- Hang on.
- Wait, can't you just tell me?

93
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:39,682
OK, a lot of those accounts
have a St. George's Cross

94
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:41,962
and I'd stick a monkey
on the owners

95
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:47,002
enjoying at least two out
of Brexit, real ale and dogging.

96
00:04:56,323 --> 00:05:00,084
Eleanor has provided me with
a report monitoring the rise of

97
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:02,564
far right online extremism.

98
00:05:02,644 --> 00:05:05,324
Makes clear that in
the wake of recent events,

99
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:07,325
the rise has become a search.

100
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:09,085
Escalation of rhetoric,

101
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:13,885
hate, conspiracy, violence,
calls for insurrection.

102
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:16,765
We're seeing suspicion
over the Singer Report.

103
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:21,886
An increasing belief that Jiayou Energy's
sea-bed drilling set off the ship explosion

104
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:27,527
and the cyber attacks gives these sites at
drum to beat that the UK is weak, defenseless,

105
00:05:27,647 --> 00:05:29,647
We should probably
ask intelligence

106
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:32,207
to do something about
those attacks.

107
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:38,688
One site, Firestorm, stands out
in prominence reach, vitriol.

108
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:41,528
And it's targeting those
it regards as most deserving

109
00:05:41,568 --> 00:05:44,768
of summary justice:
The Home Secretary,

110
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:49,769
Foreign Secretary, Lord Singer.
The Prime Minister.

111
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:53,329
And his wife.

112
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:56,129
Rachel. Why?

113
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,770
Her links to Kostenko,

114
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,690
it doesn't matter
that it's just smoke.

115
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,450
If this is incitement, how does it
not come under the Terrorism Act?

116
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,090
Well, we're navigating a legal
minefield to find out, but um...

117
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:10,691
For Christ's sake, I've been
a Conservative MP for 30 years.

118
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:15,011
I've been screamed at,
egged, fruit-pelted, mud-pied.

119
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:18,572
So I'm afraid I just can't
muster the willies

120
00:06:18,652 --> 00:06:20,572
over some pallid
little bedwetter.

121
00:06:20,652 --> 00:06:25,652
Everyone we consider at risk
will be assigned additional security.

122
00:06:25,772 --> 00:06:27,213
You ought to reconsider
attending

123
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,453
the memorial for the victims
of the Kent disaster.

124
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:32,773
Now if I need extra security,
so be it, but I'm going.

125
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,653
Prime Minister if I could just
point out...

126
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:38,774
300 people lost their
lives, I'm going.

127
00:06:38,894 --> 00:06:41,414
This meeting is over and um,

128
00:06:41,454 --> 00:06:46,534
Firestorm, I wanna know
who it is and how we stop it.

129
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:55,335
Hey I appreciate
you coming in, Hari.

130
00:06:55,455 --> 00:06:57,656
Sorry, it's a bit rushed.
Thanks.

131
00:06:57,696 --> 00:06:59,576
Francine said you
were going to the memorial.

132
00:06:59,656 --> 00:07:02,896
- With Sutherland.
- Yes, Labour and Tory,

133
00:07:02,976 --> 00:07:04,776
hand in hand.

134
00:07:04,856 --> 00:07:07,977
British fortitude
and Blitz spirit, etc.

135
00:07:08,017 --> 00:07:10,777
Oh, hadn't pegged
you as a cynic, Hari.

136
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,897
I'm a believer,
in Francine

137
00:07:12,977 --> 00:07:17,418
and your resuscitation of
the party. That's why I'm here.

138
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:21,538
And why I'm about to publish another
gut punch to Robert Sutherland?

139
00:07:21,578 --> 00:07:23,018
Any chance for preview on that?

140
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:27,579
No.

141
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:29,219
To be clear,
I'm on your side.

142
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:31,779
- But Morbid Symptoms ain't no Pravda.
- Understood.

143
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:37,460
- I'm just here to talk about Francine's campaign.
- Yes, let's do that.

144
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,140
- I think you should come with me.
- To the memorial?

145
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,100
To your future constituency.

146
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,020
I think I've filled my quota of
political opportunism this week.

147
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,661
Opportunism, what you don't
mean the Singer interview?

148
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,301
I
O, as it happens.

149
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:50,901
I'm really not ok
with a strategy

150
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:53,221
that lets a bunch of far
right assholes use me to

151
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:55,101
legitimize their bullshit.

152
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,781
Well, we polled after
your appearance.

153
00:07:56,901 --> 00:08:00,902
Overwhelmingly positive
reaction from the members.

154
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:02,742
And if you've also
broadened your appeal to...

155
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,462
Fascists, Jesus Christ.

156
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:12,223
I want to announce
that you're contesting in Kent,

157
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:14,583
and I want you to win.

158
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:17,664
Because I want
you on my front bench.

159
00:08:17,704 --> 00:08:19,520
If ballot papers then shower
on you like confetti

160
00:08:19,544 --> 00:08:23,704
then I don't really
care who throws them.

161
00:08:28,665 --> 00:08:33,145
Lord Singer, we take this kind of
precautionary measure all the time.

162
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:35,505
It's just, peace of mind, Allan.

163
00:08:35,545 --> 00:08:37,906
Oh, for God's sake, Robert.

164
00:08:38,026 --> 00:08:41,666
In my entire career of
prosecuting and sentencing,

165
00:08:41,786 --> 00:08:45,026
I've never once
needed a police guard,

166
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,427
but I conduct one
inquiry for your government.

167
00:08:48,547 --> 00:08:52,267
I mean, it's bad enough being
harangued by the press night and day,

168
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:55,667
but worse than that, that
bloody Francine Bridge woman

169
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:59,788
is on the news accusing
me of being a stooge.

170
00:08:59,828 --> 00:09:04,668
But to top it all, I'm now
on a fascist hit list.

171
00:09:04,748 --> 00:09:09,429
- Allan, look...
- And you call it peace of mind.

172
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,749
Marjorie and I were
going away next week

173
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:13,549
to the house in Cyprus.

174
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:16,789
We'll cancel the flights.
We'll leave tonight.

175
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:21,030
We'd prefer it if we could
guarantee your security here.

176
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,150
And I would prefer it
if you could guarantee it

177
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,310
til Marjorie and I are
away from this bloody bedlam,

178
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:33,071
and we return when you can make sure
she's at no further risk of being widowed.

179
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:46,752
Please, come in.

180
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:50,153
Sorry to intrude.
I wanted to catch you before.

181
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:52,553
An unexpected pleasure.

182
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,553
And to which ailing
area of policy do I owe it?

183
00:09:58,034 --> 00:10:01,394
It's a actually
about the by-election,

184
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,314
Clive Turner's seat.

185
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:05,154
God rest his soul.

186
00:10:05,194 --> 00:10:11,675
Yes, quite, but we'd rather
his seat rested with the Tories.

187
00:10:11,795 --> 00:10:16,555
We've been discussing
potential candidates and...

188
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:19,676
one mooted is Roger Hawkins.

189
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:23,676
Is he Robert's choice?

190
00:10:23,796 --> 00:10:25,436
The discussion is ongoing.

191
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:28,917
Roger's name cropped up and I...

192
00:10:32,557 --> 00:10:37,318
If Robert were to end up

193
00:10:37,398 --> 00:10:39,758
leaning towards him.

194
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:44,518
I wondered how comfortably
that would sit with you.

195
00:10:44,558 --> 00:10:49,839
Because Roger has some...
eccentric views.

196
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,959
Because he has a widely
documented history

197
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:56,559
of inflammatory rabble rousing
and barely veiled racism.

198
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,920
Well. Nobody's perfect.

199
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,320
Look, I have no desire
to break bread

200
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,641
with Roger Hawkins, but.

201
00:11:08,681 --> 00:11:10,761
I assume he's Robert's choice

202
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:12,761
'cause Robert thinks he can win.

203
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:16,441
And, given the demographic,
he probably can.

204
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:19,082
That demographic being
a white working class

205
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:23,162
whom a populist like Hawkins
will do his best to whip up.

206
00:11:23,202 --> 00:11:26,762
I would have thought that would have
been more troubling to Home Secretary.

207
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:30,643
A Home Secretary or a black man?

208
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:37,524
I'm frankly curious as to why it
doesn't trouble you as either.

209
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:40,564
Whether or not it
troubles me is irrelevant.

210
00:11:40,684 --> 00:11:43,164
We need to hold the seat.

211
00:11:43,284 --> 00:11:45,044
And I trust Robert's judgment.

212
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:48,805
So... I'm afraid...

213
00:11:50,045 --> 00:11:53,045
I cannot lend authentic
ethnic ballast

214
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:55,445
to your struggles
in dissuading him.

215
00:11:58,566 --> 00:12:00,526
And if his judgment's wrong?

216
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:02,566
Well...

217
00:12:02,646 --> 00:12:07,086
We learn from
the mistakes of others.

218
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:09,767
As much as from our own.

219
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:11,047
Shall we?

220
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:13,807
We don't want to miss our lift.

221
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:30,569
Rachel, the car will
be here shortly. You ready?

222
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:37,690
Darling, what's the matter?

223
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,330
That website that tried to make out that lad
something to do with kickbacks to Kostenko.

224
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,570
They've just tried even harder.

225
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,185
Oh... it's going to be all over the
news and I'm so sorry but it's lies.

226
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:48,650
I swear it's lies.

227
00:12:48,674 --> 00:12:50,574
Rachel, I don't know
what you're talking about.

228
00:12:50,627 --> 00:12:53,451
Hari Misra from Morbid Symptoms
has interviewed a former colleague

229
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:56,571
of mine claiming
I knew about the bribes.

230
00:12:56,651 --> 00:13:00,452
He's saying it's impossible
I didn't know what was going on.

231
00:13:00,532 --> 00:13:02,172
On what grounds,
you were a junior.

232
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:05,692
Yeah I was but you know,
right home to the senior and

233
00:13:05,812 --> 00:13:08,053
I didn't know my senior
was breaking the law of course

234
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:11,533
I fucking didn't but Nigel
Raine's saying either Ine new

235
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:14,293
and turned a blind eye
or I was part of it.

236
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,573
Surely that's defamation.

237
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:19,454
He's too slick to do
anything actionable.

238
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:23,814
He's lying,
but I can't prove it.

239
00:13:23,854 --> 00:13:27,695
I don't think he's going
public to grind to an old axe,

240
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:30,775
so maybe it's money,
maybe it's blackmail,

241
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:32,815
but somebody's got their
hand up the puppet

242
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:34,775
and it's the same
someone I imagine

243
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,775
who gave the documents
to Morbid Symptoms,

244
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:40,536
and then you know the dots
just joined themselves.

245
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:44,456
- Dots?
- Oh Rob come on.

246
00:13:44,536 --> 00:13:47,657
This assault on me
amid the cyber attacks

247
00:13:47,697 --> 00:13:51,697
isn't happening by unfortunate
fucking coincidence.

248
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:56,297
It's your integrity, your job,
they're trying to capsize.

249
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:58,778
And I'm just.

250
00:13:58,818 --> 00:14:01,458
Mine are just collateral damage.

251
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:30,181
So our dead man has a name.

252
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:32,861
The body found in
the truck was Edward Price.

253
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:34,701
U.S. citizen.

254
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:36,821
He was abducted on
a holiday in Bordeaux.

255
00:14:36,861 --> 00:14:38,582
Have the Americans been
informed?

256
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:41,422
Not yet, but the NSA are
breathing down our necks.

257
00:14:41,462 --> 00:14:42,862
The NSA, why?

258
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:45,822
Price was a scientist at DARPA.

259
00:14:45,942 --> 00:14:47,943
- The military lab.
- Military technology, yes

260
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:52,303
but Price's field of research
was heavily classified.

261
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:55,543
Last time Ihecked the Americans
were still our key allies, hecked

262
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,440
so they may be able to tell us
why one of theirs

263
00:14:57,464 --> 00:15:01,584
ended up glowing like Chernobyl
in the back of the lorry.

264
00:15:01,704 --> 00:15:04,544
Speak to their intelligence as
a matter of immediate urgency.

265
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:09,185
Understood and I'll pass on
your gratitude to my team, shall I?

266
00:15:11,825 --> 00:15:15,065
Why don't we just file it
under better late than never?

267
00:15:17,105 --> 00:15:20,426
I would like to
clarify one last thing.

268
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:24,346
- Yes?
- I am keen for us to work together

269
00:15:24,426 --> 00:15:26,186
as productively as possible.

270
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,947
Despite your pitiful animosity.

271
00:15:28,987 --> 00:15:31,347
But when I am briefing COBRA,

272
00:15:31,427 --> 00:15:35,107
please keep your snide little
peashooter in your pencil case.

273
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:38,708
Just a little levity
between colleagues.

274
00:15:38,788 --> 00:15:42,348
You never struck me as the type
to feel so needled.

275
00:15:42,428 --> 00:15:45,228
And you always struck me
as knowing better

276
00:15:45,348 --> 00:15:49,989
than to pull an Oxbridge
Rapier on a serrated machete.

277
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:52,349
I'd never pull a rapier.

278
00:15:52,469 --> 00:15:54,189
I was in the Pistol Club.

279
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:59,070
And I Foreign Secretary,
am the Royal fucking Artillery.

280
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,710
- Pencil case it is there.
- Hm.

281
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:12,951
While we the people starve,
these corrupt gluttons

282
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:15,431
continue to gorge
at the troth of power.

283
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:18,552
More proof from Hari Misra
of the corruption in no. 10.

284
00:16:18,592 --> 00:16:23,352
Rachel Sutherland was at the
heart of the Kostenko bribery scandal.

285
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:27,993
My brothers, we must take action
and stamp on these cockroaches.

286
00:16:28,073 --> 00:16:32,593
Let's rise up for justice
and our nation.

287
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,799
On the same bench for once.

288
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:37,520
Well, if ever there
was a place for miracles.

289
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:44,120
I shall begin with a reading
from Philippians 4, verse 8.

290
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,840
Whatever is true,

291
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:54,081
whatever is honorable, whatever
is just, whatever is pure.

292
00:17:55,081 --> 00:18:01,642
Whatever is pleasing,
whatever is commendable,

293
00:18:01,762 --> 00:18:05,682
if there is any
excellence in it.

294
00:18:05,802 --> 00:18:10,283
If there is anything
worthy of praise.

295
00:18:10,363 --> 00:18:12,243
We are here today.

296
00:18:13,683 --> 00:18:18,284
In the memory of these
people who have perished.

297
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:23,164
I want you to consider
these thoughts.

298
00:18:23,284 --> 00:18:26,084
No recriminations,
no guilt.

299
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:32,085
Just the memory of
good things in their life.

300
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:37,806
Keep away!

301
00:18:37,846 --> 00:18:40,246
Thank you!

302
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:52,367
Pleasant journey here?

303
00:18:52,407 --> 00:18:57,368
Apart from being told I'm now
a target for Nazi terrorists.

304
00:18:57,448 --> 00:19:02,328
I'm sorry Rachel. We are doing
everything we can to mitigate.

305
00:19:02,368 --> 00:19:06,008
You sound just
like a politician.

306
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:13,049
No comment!

307
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,610
- ...the truth?
- Step back sir!

308
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:25,130
How many times do I
have to say no comment!

309
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,091
Step back.

310
00:19:29,571 --> 00:19:31,651
Can you just leave us alone?

311
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:36,091
Mr. Singer? Did you
sing for your supper?

312
00:19:36,131 --> 00:19:37,892
What?

313
00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:46,052
Eleanor, can't this wait?

314
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,653
He's what?

315
00:19:51,653 --> 00:19:53,893
No, no he's what?

316
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:57,414
Oh my God.

317
00:19:57,534 --> 00:19:59,094
Police and ambulance crews

318
00:19:59,134 --> 00:20:01,014
attended the scene
where the killing took place.

319
00:20:01,054 --> 00:20:02,934
The suspect has
been apprehended.

320
00:20:03,054 --> 00:20:06,054
A message has been recovered
from his recording equipment.

321
00:20:06,094 --> 00:20:08,535
A warning. This report
contains images that some

322
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:10,855
people may find disturbing.

323
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:19,296
I have stamped on a cockroach.

324
00:20:19,376 --> 00:20:22,096
Great Britain has one less
instrument of corruption.

325
00:20:24,096 --> 00:20:28,097
Where I've gone,
me and my brothers follow.

326
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:30,257
He don't sing for
his supper no more.

327
00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:32,097
There'll be
a statement from the police

328
00:20:32,137 --> 00:20:35,657
shortly regarding the murder
of Lord Allan Singer.

329
00:20:42,338 --> 00:20:44,098
What's happened?

330
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,460
A statement of sympathy has been
issued for Lord Singer's family.

331
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,300
And the protection officer?

332
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,420
Critical but stable.

333
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,861
Our next move
needs to be robust.

334
00:21:08,941 --> 00:21:11,181
- This cannot stand.
- She's bloody right.

335
00:21:11,301 --> 00:21:12,821
Look at this.

336
00:21:12,861 --> 00:21:15,101
The killer,
this Thompson bastard,

337
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:18,302
now a hero
to the nutter factions.

338
00:21:18,382 --> 00:21:21,862
His disgusting footage
all over social bloody media.

339
00:21:21,942 --> 00:21:25,182
I'm aware and the companies have
said they'll be cooperative,

340
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:28,863
but every time they stamp it
out, it pops up somewhere else.

341
00:21:28,903 --> 00:21:31,543
Meanwhile, we are
monitoring a worrying

342
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,423
traction with certain conspiracy
theories that Thompson was put

343
00:21:35,543 --> 00:21:37,384
up to the murder by MI 5

344
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:40,864
which is now being tide to theories
that the Prime Minister ordered

345
00:21:40,944 --> 00:21:43,384
the Kostenko assassination.

346
00:21:43,424 --> 00:21:45,864
To protect his wife
from prosecution.

347
00:21:45,944 --> 00:21:48,105
Firestorm.

348
00:21:50,025 --> 00:21:52,465
Firestorm incited Thompson.

349
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,185
And now Allan Singer is dead.

350
00:22:00,306 --> 00:22:02,306
There will be another Thompson.

351
00:22:02,386 --> 00:22:05,906
And another.
Ore dead.

352
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:09,187
As long as Firestorm
is spewing its poison.

353
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:13,107
And this government
will not tolerate that.

354
00:22:13,147 --> 00:22:16,387
I don't doubt that we could
prosecute whoever's behind.

355
00:22:16,427 --> 00:22:21,348
Firestorm under the Terrorism
Act. The issue is finding them.

356
00:22:21,388 --> 00:22:24,108
You said the internet companies
were being cooperative.

357
00:22:24,148 --> 00:22:27,789
To the usual limits,
but if we demand records,

358
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:31,189
we're looking down the barrel
of an enormous legal fight.

359
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:32,829
That's not good.

360
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:35,869
We won't look strong,
we'll look draconian.

361
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:37,630
Then what do we do about this?

362
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:46,430
Then we don't go through
these bloody companies.

363
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,271
We tell GCHQ to go around.

364
00:22:50,631 --> 00:22:52,191
Underneath.

365
00:22:52,311 --> 00:22:54,191
Is that legal?

366
00:22:54,311 --> 00:22:57,872
It's um... somewhat gray.

367
00:22:57,952 --> 00:23:00,872
I don't give a shit
if it's jet black, do it.

368
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:03,272
Understood.

369
00:23:03,352 --> 00:23:05,872
And then deal with Hari Misra.

370
00:23:05,912 --> 00:23:09,393
His site's adding fuel
to all of this.

371
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:10,913
So now we're
arresting journalists,

372
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:13,353
Finding out who
pulls his strings.

373
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,793
The investigation is
progressing, Prime Minister.

374
00:23:15,873 --> 00:23:19,154
Well, I'm sure that inspires
us all with confidence.

375
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:25,154
Thank you Elena. Racine.

376
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:35,915
Joseph didn't seem happy
with our strategy.

377
00:23:36,035 --> 00:23:37,836
I'm sure he'll come on board.

378
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:41,196
If it puts at least one hateful
bastard under lock and key.

379
00:23:41,316 --> 00:23:43,036
Since you mention him.

380
00:23:43,116 --> 00:23:47,116
I wouldn't mind your opinion on
something if you got a moment.

381
00:23:47,196 --> 00:23:48,677
It's what I'm here for.

382
00:24:00,478 --> 00:24:02,878
What do you think of him?

383
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,478
Who?

384
00:24:04,598 --> 00:24:06,118
Joseph, Anna.

385
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:10,319
I think...

386
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:13,119
Why?

387
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:17,119
Because I'm asking.

388
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Bright.
Charismatic.

389
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,880
Ambitious.

390
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:29,601
Do you want an essay?

391
00:24:29,641 --> 00:24:30,857
No, I just thought you might say

392
00:24:30,881 --> 00:24:32,801
someone was recruiting.

393
00:24:32,881 --> 00:24:35,281
To harangue me over
my choice of Roger Hawkins

394
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:37,482
for the by-election.

395
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:43,202
Robert...
- Before we discuss you going behind my back.

396
00:24:43,322 --> 00:24:45,642
Roger Hawkins may
be to the right of us

397
00:24:45,682 --> 00:24:47,443
may even be a reactionary,
but I will tell

398
00:24:47,563 --> 00:24:49,363
you something he hasn't done.

399
00:24:49,403 --> 00:24:52,563
He hasn't accused a respected
judge of corruption

400
00:24:52,643 --> 00:24:54,403
shortly before
he was butchered and even

401
00:24:54,483 --> 00:24:56,043
supplied the fucking
hashtag for it.

402
00:24:56,123 --> 00:24:59,604
You brought Francine Bridge in,
vouch for her.

403
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:03,324
I
Ear you're even pals again.

404
00:25:03,404 --> 00:25:05,724
And yet you have the temerity
to question my judgment.

405
00:25:05,844 --> 00:25:07,325
You think Francine
is the problem,

406
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:09,645
you're going to blame
a black woman for feeding

407
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:12,205
far right extremism while
you shove your weight behind

408
00:25:12,325 --> 00:25:14,565
a dog whistling jingoist.

409
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:16,845
And yes, I spoke
to Joseph because my job

410
00:25:16,885 --> 00:25:19,126
is to make sure you make
the best possible decision.

411
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:22,046
But maybe that's something
overdue for reappraisal.

412
00:25:31,927 --> 00:25:32,927
Robert...

413
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,608
Get a fucking grip.

414
00:25:55,169 --> 00:25:56,969
I say this with kindness.

415
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:00,290
But you're mental, thinking
you played a part in it.

416
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,690
Any fucking part.

417
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:06,090
Scumbag who killed
Singer was a Nazi incel,

418
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,891
you think a prick like
that listens to a black woman?

419
00:26:08,971 --> 00:26:12,851
All you did was speak
truth to power and...

420
00:26:12,891 --> 00:26:14,411
Christ knows that's
what this country

421
00:26:14,451 --> 00:26:15,651
needs from its politicians.

422
00:26:15,731 --> 00:26:19,052
You did your job.
Like I do mine.

423
00:26:19,132 --> 00:26:22,452
Maybe you've just
had more practice.

424
00:26:22,572 --> 00:26:25,452
- At truth?
- At collateral damage.

425
00:26:25,572 --> 00:26:28,453
I mean, when you run pieces
that, like with Rachel Sutherland,

426
00:26:28,573 --> 00:26:30,653
Oh Jesus, seriously?

427
00:26:30,693 --> 00:26:33,133
Next you'll ask me how I sleep,
how do you sleep?

428
00:26:33,173 --> 00:26:35,453
Like a baby, curled up and
crying all night for my mum.

429
00:26:35,573 --> 00:26:38,054
I'm being serious Harry,
a man is dead.

430
00:26:38,134 --> 00:26:42,414
I'm being serious too.
About truth.

431
00:26:42,494 --> 00:26:45,854
And truth is the only blade
that draws blood from liars.

432
00:26:45,894 --> 00:26:49,295
However deep the lie,
however high the liar.

433
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:52,175
Your sources must find
that very comforting.

434
00:26:52,295 --> 00:26:55,655
I couldn't tell you, lately,
I don't even know who they are.

435
00:26:55,735 --> 00:26:57,856
Doesn't that bother you?

436
00:26:57,896 --> 00:27:01,136
Nothing I've been sent is illegal and I
don't run anything without due diligence.

437
00:27:01,216 --> 00:27:03,656
Yeah but if you don't
know who, you don't know why.

438
00:27:03,696 --> 00:27:05,576
I mean, the Rachel Sutherland
stuff for example,

439
00:27:05,616 --> 00:27:07,136
somebody has got an agenda.

440
00:27:07,216 --> 00:27:11,937
I don't care when it's my story,
it's my agenda.

441
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:15,137
Remind me not to come to you
for emotional support again.

442
00:27:16,857 --> 00:27:18,818
Look, here's an idea.

443
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:20,698
We do an interview for the site.

444
00:27:20,818 --> 00:27:23,298
You can be front footed
with your reaction to Singer.

445
00:27:23,378 --> 00:27:25,058
Denounce all extremism.

446
00:27:25,138 --> 00:27:29,139
State in all caps,
how we must cleave to truth,

447
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:30,619
but also peace.

448
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,499
And then we can have dinner.

449
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:35,219
You just don't quit, do you?

450
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,900
Nope.

451
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:55,981
Jesus Christ.

452
00:28:09,903 --> 00:28:12,983
Lab's this way and just before
the ship blew,

453
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:16,823
we had a reconnaissance boat
over it scanning, gathering data.

454
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,424
The condition of the hull, the
munitions, seabed seismology

455
00:28:19,504 --> 00:28:20,664
all got bloody obliterated.

456
00:28:20,704 --> 00:28:22,704
Along with 300 people.

457
00:28:29,345 --> 00:28:30,505
Audrey.

458
00:28:36,385 --> 00:28:39,666
I'm here. I'm here.

459
00:28:39,746 --> 00:28:42,306
Like I said, obliterated.

460
00:28:42,386 --> 00:28:44,866
The dive team have been
searching the wreckage

461
00:28:44,906 --> 00:28:48,147
and this morning
we found our video.

462
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:54,187
Heard of a black box on a
plane? Well, it's that. For boats.

463
00:28:54,307 --> 00:28:58,108
All data up until the moment of
destination is backed up here.

464
00:28:58,148 --> 00:29:00,228
Well that's, that's
excellent news, isn't it?

465
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:03,068
Well force of the blast
damaged the unit,

466
00:29:03,148 --> 00:29:06,148
we've only just managing to
pull the readings from it now.

467
00:29:06,188 --> 00:29:08,149
Look spectrogram.

468
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:10,989
Taken moments
before the explosion.

469
00:29:11,109 --> 00:29:12,989
These lines represent
the noise made

470
00:29:13,109 --> 00:29:15,069
from the boats' engines
and down here.

471
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:17,830
We'd expect to see a low seismic
frequency from the tremor

472
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,910
that set off the blast.

473
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,950
This is what a tremor
should look like.

474
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,670
This was taken 17 hours
prior to the explosion,

475
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:28,671
but when the boat went off.
There's nothing.

476
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:30,511
So the scanner was bust.

477
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:33,071
Or, there was no tremor at all,

478
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:36,111
- but hang on what's this?
- Ah.

479
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:40,872
Something extremely low
frequency but high decibel.

480
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:43,672
Let me show you more detail.

481
00:29:43,712 --> 00:29:45,912
Starts here 32 minutes,

482
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:51,873
then stops.
3.7 seconds later... boom.

483
00:29:51,913 --> 00:29:53,913
If that's not a tremor,
what could it be?

484
00:29:53,953 --> 00:29:55,673
Most likely a faulty sensor.

485
00:29:55,713 --> 00:29:57,874
But just supposing
it wasn't faulty,

486
00:29:57,914 --> 00:30:00,674
I have no idea, But I can
tell you

487
00:30:00,714 --> 00:30:03,874
there's no natural phenomena
which explains this wave pattern.

488
00:30:03,914 --> 00:30:05,954
We're still analyzing.

489
00:30:28,877 --> 00:30:30,917
Bored of your office?

490
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:36,117
Just thought we'd come
face to say. Take the air.

491
00:30:41,158 --> 00:30:45,318
New hobby.
14 years since I quit.

492
00:30:46,598 --> 00:30:47,999
That's plenty.

493
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,080
I'm worried about Robert.

494
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,480
He's...

495
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,081
I think this thing with Rachel
might be pushing him over the edge.

496
00:31:08,161 --> 00:31:10,441
Yeah, about that.

497
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:14,241
I didn't move this meeting
out of my office for fresh air.

498
00:31:14,361 --> 00:31:18,082
I'm here because I'm doing
you a favor I shouldn't be.

499
00:31:18,162 --> 00:31:23,082
Francine Bridge. Are you still
friends? Or friends again?

500
00:31:23,162 --> 00:31:26,922
Yeah, -She's due to give Hari
Misra an interview this afternoon,

501
00:31:27,002 --> 00:31:29,243
but he won't be able to make it.

502
00:31:29,363 --> 00:31:33,763
There's been an escalation
and our hand's been forced.

503
00:31:33,883 --> 00:31:35,843
If you value Francine,

504
00:31:35,923 --> 00:31:39,964
and she values anything
resembling a political future,

505
00:31:40,084 --> 00:31:43,084
tell her to cut Misra loose.

506
00:31:43,164 --> 00:31:44,684
And do it now.

507
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,170
Holy fucking hell.

508
00:33:05,732 --> 00:33:08,733
What the...

509
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:17,694
Grip it or what?

510
00:33:18,654 --> 00:33:19,854
Fuck this.

511
00:33:33,655 --> 00:33:36,175
It isn't fucking on.

512
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,979
Hey Anna, can I call you back? I'm about to...
-No.

513
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:15,979
- Yeah, I'm about to do an interview.
- I know.

514
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:18,500
- Wait, how do you know?
- I need you to meet me, now.

515
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,716
Yeah, I can't like I said
I'm about to do this interview.

516
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,900
- Hari is not someone you should associate with.
- What?

517
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,900
Please listen, I don't
want to speak on the phone,

518
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,397
but I... I need you...
- OK, Anna, I will call you back, all right? Bye.

519
00:34:28,421 --> 00:34:30,541
Alright, bye.

520
00:34:47,943 --> 00:34:51,023
He's on the move, follow or...

521
00:34:52,263 --> 00:34:53,383
Take him.

522
00:34:55,623 --> 00:34:57,544
Who the fuck are they?

523
00:35:08,585 --> 00:35:09,945
Passenger on board?

524
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:11,905
Boss, someone else
snatched him.

525
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:13,905
What do you mean someone else?

526
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,105
The car came out of nowhere
and they grabbed him.

527
00:35:16,225 --> 00:35:18,306
What fucking car?

528
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:19,386
Follow!

529
00:35:19,426 --> 00:35:22,146
- Eleanor?
- What?

530
00:35:36,787 --> 00:35:39,468
Firestorm, we've traced it.

531
00:35:39,548 --> 00:35:41,108
- We know who he is.
- Who?

532
00:35:41,228 --> 00:35:42,668
Gavin Beadle,

533
00:35:42,788 --> 00:35:45,468
currently at his residence
in Old Trafford,

534
00:35:45,548 --> 00:35:47,268
Everything is in
place for the raid.

535
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:49,509
I need your permission
to proceed.

536
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:51,629
Do it now.

537
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:09,951
Pop his hat off.

538
00:36:14,871 --> 00:36:17,312
- Hello, Hari.
- Who are you?

539
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:19,112
I'm Tommy.

540
00:36:19,232 --> 00:36:20,392
So's he.

541
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:23,072
Yard? MI5?

542
00:36:23,152 --> 00:36:24,592
We're Tommy.

543
00:36:26,272 --> 00:36:27,553
Let's talk about you.

544
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:45,754
Two units: I will proceed with Unit
Alpha to the front of the building.

545
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:49,395
Sierra five will proceed with Unit
Bravo to the rear of the building.

546
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:53,115
Then all units hold position and
await my command to breach.

547
00:36:53,235 --> 00:36:55,955
May 22nd to 27th, 2015.

548
00:36:56,035 --> 00:36:58,476
You took a trip to Moscow.

549
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:01,236
Is that when you
were taped up by the SVR?

550
00:37:01,316 --> 00:37:03,956
I was reporting
a gay pride rally.

551
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:11,157
Sierra five trojan three-seven. That's
a go. Proceed to breaching position.

552
00:37:11,277 --> 00:37:14,277
Trojan three-seven
zero five moving now.

553
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,277
Sierra five confirm
when you're in position.

554
00:37:16,357 --> 00:37:18,878
Let's talk about
another report, then.

555
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:21,478
The one you were due
to publish tomorrow.

556
00:37:21,558 --> 00:37:25,958
The one you were instructed
to run by your masters.

557
00:37:25,998 --> 00:37:30,919
To disseminate egregious
untruths about the United States.

558
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:35,119
You work for the yanks.
You're mercs?

559
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,040
Get back inside.

560
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,481
Sierra five trojan three seven.
Front position held.

561
00:37:47,521 --> 00:37:49,881
No sign of movement,
confirm your status.

562
00:37:49,961 --> 00:37:53,321
Trojan three-seven zero five. In
position. Awaiting breach signal.

563
00:38:02,762 --> 00:38:06,122
Who gave you
the American documents?

564
00:38:10,763 --> 00:38:14,603
Who is your fucking handler?

565
00:38:16,283 --> 00:38:20,044
Trojan three seven stand by,
unit bravo on the move.

566
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:25,484
Armed police! Armed police!

567
00:38:25,564 --> 00:38:27,645
Armed police!

568
00:38:34,285 --> 00:38:36,005
Down down, now!

569
00:38:38,846 --> 00:38:40,766
Gavin Beadle, where is he?

570
00:38:42,966 --> 00:38:46,006
Trojan three-seven, unit alpha
proceeding with search upstairs.

571
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:53,567
Two rooms, checking room one.

572
00:38:55,807 --> 00:38:59,328
Clear, clear, clear.
Proceeding to room two.

573
00:39:02,568 --> 00:39:04,688
Contact, contact, contact!

574
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:07,929
Down, down, down, get down.

575
00:39:07,969 --> 00:39:11,049
Hands behind your back,
hands behind your back.

576
00:39:11,129 --> 00:39:15,769
All units, all units. Trojan three-seven,
positive contact with suspect in room two.

577
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:20,490
Hold position. Awaiting visual
confirmation of suspect ID.

578
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,330
We actually got him.

579
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:25,450
- Trojan three seven.
- Suspect apprehended.

580
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,931
Repeat, trojan three seven,
suspect apprehended.

581
00:39:43,052 --> 00:39:44,692
N-PAS six-zero to control.

582
00:39:44,812 --> 00:39:48,293
Suspect en route to secure
location Delta Seven-Three.

583
00:39:48,373 --> 00:39:50,013
Over and out.

584
00:39:50,093 --> 00:39:53,013
Well that's one
fire snuffed out.

585
00:39:54,813 --> 00:39:57,614
Or have we stoked it?

586
00:39:57,694 --> 00:40:00,574
How many more Firestorms
are out there?

587
00:40:00,654 --> 00:40:02,574
And who's pulling the strings?

588
00:40:14,575 --> 00:40:16,335
It's Hari, you know what to do.

589
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:19,056
Not even the basic
courtesy of a text.

590
00:40:19,136 --> 00:40:21,096
You made me look a twat
this afternoon Hari.

591
00:40:44,978 --> 00:40:48,059
See, we don't have
much choice here, Hari.

592
00:40:48,139 --> 00:40:52,699
See our business is
just like yours, really.

593
00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:55,419
We're only after the truth.

594
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:04,660
I told the truth, I told you,
no, no, wait, please, don't, no.

595
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,501
Wait, wait, wait, wait! I told you the
truth, I don't know who my source is.

596
00:41:08,581 --> 00:41:10,261
Please don't...

597
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:17,141
You just said useful bloody
idiot, really, aren't you pal?

598
00:41:22,182 --> 00:41:23,582
No hard feelings.

599
00:41:25,582 --> 00:41:26,942
Ride home?

600
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,190
It is believed to be
a firebomb attack.

601
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:48,191
It's not yet known if anybody was
inside the offices of the left-leaning

602
00:42:48,311 --> 00:42:51,031
online political site
Morbid Symptoms.

603
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:55,591
There are claims a far right
group is behind the attack.
