1
00:04:10,824 --> 00:04:11,895
I have reached.

2
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:13,791
- Sample?
- It's safe.

3
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,323
Where should I come?

4
00:04:15,457 --> 00:04:18,285
You don't have to come Suraj,
you have to go.

5
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:13,090
"Looking for a reason,
without any reason"

6
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:19,643
"I lost myself in this world,
looking for the world"

7
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:26,016
"Looking for an incident"

8
00:05:26,217 --> 00:05:32,246
"Look where I have reached,
searching"

9
00:05:32,493 --> 00:05:38,972
"Everywhere, every lane,
I couldn't find my destination"

10
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:44,613
"Just holding my breath"

11
00:05:44,814 --> 00:05:51,014
"Confronted by the desert"

12
00:05:51,147 --> 00:05:57,332
"I am a gypsy, what should I do?"

13
00:05:57,535 --> 00:06:03,816
"Confronted by the desert"

14
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:11,159
"I am a gypsy, what should I do?"

15
00:06:25,373 --> 00:06:27,019
Mister, you cannot park here.
Please make a move.

16
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:29,219
Sir, I am just leaving now.

17
00:06:29,296 --> 00:06:30,697
One minute! Yes, yes!

18
00:06:30,774 --> 00:06:35,900
Cannot, cannot... You keep
your money... I want you move now...

19
00:06:37,132 --> 00:06:39,011
Look, officer! Look, just come.

20
00:06:43,272 --> 00:06:45,301
Thank you, officer! Thank you!

21
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:53,326
Here take your money!
I gave 50 to that police officer.

22
00:06:53,403 --> 00:06:55,729
This is 25, count it.

23
00:06:59,307 --> 00:07:02,493
Strange man!
If it's more, he won't take it!

24
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:03,908
If it's less, he won't say anything.

25
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:34,707
"The road was always the journey"

26
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:41,145
"Moments of peace were always short"

27
00:07:41,988 --> 00:07:47,869
"The road was always the journey"

28
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:53,833
"Moments of peace were always short"

29
00:07:54,134 --> 00:08:00,487
"I found a story teller,
looking for a caravan"

30
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:05,454
"Just holding my breath"

31
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:12,633
"Confronted by the desert"

32
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:19,119
"I am a gypsy, what should I do?"

33
00:08:19,273 --> 00:08:25,362
"Confronted by the desert"

34
00:08:25,686 --> 00:08:32,634
"I am a gypsy, what should I do?"

35
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:38,709
You took so much of time
on the first day, itself?

36
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:39,858
I'm sorry!

37
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:44,916
It is very difficult to
do a double shift in this old age.

38
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:48,356
And you? You do three shifts!

39
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,636
What will you do
with so much money, son?

40
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:54,227
I have debt that has to be repaid.

41
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:56,894
Your wish!

42
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:59,600
Take this key.

43
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:05,371
My life of double
shifts is now finished.

44
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,599
All the best, son! All the best.

45
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:17,708
'What a strategy!'

46
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:20,224
'He ducks,
he misses, and reminds him again.'

47
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,120
'Wow! What a fight!
Oh, another one! What a fight!'

48
00:09:23,285 --> 00:09:24,614
'Oh! He's getting a hold!'

49
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:26,776
'Woah! And that's a...'

50
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:37,348
'What a kick! I think,
the match is going to end very soon.'

51
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,301
Hey guard, working or sleeping?

52
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:42,477
Idiot!

53
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:47,403
'It's almost a one sided match!'

54
00:09:48,924 --> 00:09:50,853
Hey! Why did you turn it off?

55
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:52,473
Change the channel!

56
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:54,363
It must be almost
in 8 o'clock in India.

57
00:09:54,564 --> 00:09:56,378
Please, put on my channel.

58
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,765
What is this?
You still haven't watered this?

59
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:03,176
I told you,
this has to be watered twice a day.

60
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:04,805
How many times have I told you?

61
00:10:04,886 --> 00:10:08,075
As soon as it's almost 8 o'clock
in India, turn on my channel.

62
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:09,646
When will you understand?

63
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,251
Take this!

64
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:14,247
Take it!

65
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:16,796
What are you waiting for?
Catch it!

66
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:21,408
Now, what was the
need to bring all this...

67
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:26,128
It's your favorite carrot pudding,
uncle Usman.

68
00:10:26,414 --> 00:10:30,354
Now, how many times have
I told you not to play with fire?

69
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:33,168
But, you?
just blah- blah- blah- blah- blah!

70
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:36,690
If the lecture is over,
taste it and tell me how it tastes?

71
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:40,050
Here, come on!

72
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:42,318
I don't like sweets.

73
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:46,334
Who are you?

74
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,616
What are you doing
in uncle Usman's cabin?

75
00:10:50,771 --> 00:10:54,111
Uncle Usman has retired
today and I joined in his place.

76
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:55,029
Oh!

77
00:10:55,973 --> 00:10:57,202
You're a native.

78
00:10:57,754 --> 00:10:59,031
Strange fool you are!

79
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:00,416
Couldn't you tell me before?

80
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,768
You didn't give me a chance!

81
00:11:01,844 --> 00:11:04,355
I will go to uncle Usman's
house and set him right!

82
00:11:04,492 --> 00:11:06,012
Who just goes away without informing?

83
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,687
First of all, uncle Usman
is not here and to top it...

84
00:11:08,813 --> 00:11:11,360
I don't know whether Bindiya's
mother-in-law will agree or not.

85
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:12,773
Mother-in-law?

86
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,345
She is very strict!

87
00:11:14,694 --> 00:11:16,774
Poor Bindiya was just
about to apologize.

88
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:21,009
Now, her fat mother-in-law knows
she was lying to go to the office!

89
00:11:23,174 --> 00:11:24,055
Who is Bindiya?

90
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:26,355
"I am the Bindiya (ornament)
of your forehead!"

91
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:28,305
It's the biggest hit
on Indian television.

92
00:11:28,382 --> 00:11:29,135
Don't you watch it?

93
00:11:29,216 --> 00:11:31,443
That's what uncle Usman
and I used to watch together.

94
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:33,656
Today, he ditched me!

95
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:37,875
Anyways,
if uncle Usman is not here, then...

96
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,393
I think I should leave, right?

97
00:11:47,037 --> 00:11:47,778
Okay!

98
00:11:49,104 --> 00:11:50,515
I think I should go.

99
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,364
If you wish you can come inside.

100
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,182
No, thanks! I'm fine.

101
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:34,984
The weather is bad and...

102
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:38,761
Bindiya should have
reached home by now.

103
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,613
- And her mother-in-law...
- Fat and strict!

104
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:44,585
I don't know how she's going to react.

105
00:12:48,943 --> 00:12:50,404
What is her mother-in-law's name?

106
00:12:50,556 --> 00:12:51,296
Kalavati!

107
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,827
'Kalavati is the name
of truth and the idol of love.'

108
00:12:55,346 --> 00:12:57,130
'You have cheated Kalavati!'

109
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,072
'Cheated! Cheated!'

110
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:01,983
'Cheated! Cheated!'

111
00:13:02,446 --> 00:13:07,827
'But, you forgot that
Kalavati wears glasses...'

112
00:13:08,152 --> 00:13:10,763
so that if someone tries
to throw dust into her eyes...'

113
00:13:10,908 --> 00:13:15,829
'the dust collides with
the glasses and falls to the ground!'

114
00:13:17,272 --> 00:13:21,569
'The bond of mother-in-law and
daughter-in-law is a fragile wall...'

115
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:26,739
'but, you have kicked
down the wall of belief!'

116
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:30,111
'No, mother!
I haven't done anything of the sort.'

117
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,967
'I value the honor of this
family even more than my life!'

118
00:13:34,535 --> 00:13:36,092
'Please forgive me!'

119
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:37,846
'The Suryavanshi family...'

120
00:13:38,038 --> 00:13:44,321
'...then Kalavati will
not fail even once!'

121
00:13:45,351 --> 00:13:50,145
'I am the Bindiya of your forehead!'

122
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:02,714
You haven't eaten this!

123
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,328
And one more thing.

124
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,916
I am telling you because
uncle Usman is not here.

125
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:21,832
This night jasmine has
to be watered twice a day.

126
00:14:22,085 --> 00:14:22,729
Yes.

127
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,001
Can I get the address
for gym Thunderstorm?

128
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,570
Thank you.

129
00:16:24,553 --> 00:16:28,328
Okay! So now, the structure we make,
needs a strong base.

130
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:31,852
While learning clay modeling,
we need to start with the base...

131
00:16:32,173 --> 00:16:33,470
which is the armature.

132
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:35,979
So I hope all of you
are ready to learn...

133
00:16:36,057 --> 00:16:37,399
how to make you first armature.

134
00:16:37,653 --> 00:16:38,717
Yes!

135
00:16:38,849 --> 00:16:39,893
Very good!

136
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,286
So, armatures can be
made of different material.

137
00:16:42,362 --> 00:16:44,654
Like PWC pipes, wooden rods.

138
00:16:44,896 --> 00:16:47,264
Just depends on how sturdy
you want the structure to be.

139
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,495
And you know...

140
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,556
You are so good, Jenny!

141
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:55,501
I mean, you are so hot!

142
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:57,415
Thank you, Mr. Chang.

143
00:16:57,565 --> 00:17:00,496
I'm really, really impressed with you.

144
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,577
- What's your plan this evening?
- Me?

145
00:17:05,786 --> 00:17:07,070
Yeah! Of course, you!

146
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:09,181
You definitely deserve a treat!

147
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:14,497
But today, Bindiya's husband will
take her on a romantic dinner date.

148
00:17:14,894 --> 00:17:15,618
What?

149
00:17:15,892 --> 00:17:17,593
Sorry, Mr. Chang! I'm busy tonight.

150
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:19,867
8 o'clock, channel 22!
Do watch it!

151
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:21,445
Come on! Hit me harder!

152
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:26,699
Come on, punch harder!
Use your body weight!

153
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:34,297
Stop!

154
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:38,380
Mercy is the boxer's biggest enemy!

155
00:17:38,747 --> 00:17:40,620
Your opponent will
never do that for you!

156
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:45,621
So, box me harder now!
Come on! You can do it.

157
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,430
Use you left! Concentrate! Fight!

158
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,423
What happened?
Look here! Concentrate!

159
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:55,662
- Suraj!
- What?

160
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:13,105
I knew you would definitely
come here one day.

161
00:18:14,587 --> 00:18:15,665
Come here you!

162
00:18:21,473 --> 00:18:23,466
Forget about the past, Bossy!

163
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:26,067
You considered Suraj your own son.

164
00:18:26,674 --> 00:18:28,636
He has returned after 3 years.

165
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:31,163
Let's hug and start all over again.

166
00:18:31,883 --> 00:18:34,316
Trust me,
everything be like the old times.

167
00:18:37,397 --> 00:18:39,356
Come here! What did you do to me?

168
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,197
Let me show you!

169
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,957
Look here! Look!

170
00:18:44,271 --> 00:18:45,343
Look here!

171
00:18:46,398 --> 00:18:48,518
I had to leave that posh locality...

172
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:51,598
and come and live here in this area!

173
00:18:51,953 --> 00:18:56,278
I had a home which
I built with my hard work.

174
00:18:56,947 --> 00:18:58,022
It got sold.

175
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:01,239
My wife loved me a lot.

176
00:19:01,664 --> 00:19:03,800
She left me and returned to India.

177
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,859
All because of you!

178
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,560
And you think that
I will hire you again!

179
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,219
I will trust you again.

180
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:16,438
I did not come here to ask for work.
I have come to apologize.

181
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:18,001
Sorry.

182
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,821
You've come here to do me a favor.

183
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:22,762
Omi! He's come here to do me a favor.

184
00:19:23,443 --> 00:19:26,046
Why don't you say it clearly?
You've come to see...

185
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:27,883
whether Srikant is still alive.

186
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,965
If he is alive, what is his plight?

187
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:33,276
Omi! Tell him...

188
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,718
Tell him to get out of my sight.

189
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:38,604
I never want to see his face again.
Get him out from here.

190
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:40,702
Get him out!

191
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:49,365
Suraj, you don't worry.
This guy is very haughty!

192
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:51,445
But, he loves you.

193
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:54,253
And his wife was going
to leave him anyway.

194
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:56,126
Now come on,
I will introduce you to the others.

195
00:19:56,206 --> 00:19:57,419
Come on. Let's go.

196
00:20:01,206 --> 00:20:03,125
Come on, boys! Come on! Come here!

197
00:20:03,878 --> 00:20:06,049
Look who's here! This is Suraj.

198
00:20:06,536 --> 00:20:07,927
We used to call him "Storm".

199
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:09,688
He was the champion in 2012.

200
00:20:09,812 --> 00:20:11,699
There used to be no one left
to face him in the final round.

201
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:13,488
All the professional
players were defeated by him.

202
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:14,527
Hey Sikandar, come on here.

203
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:16,649
Nobody could play until
the last round with him.

204
00:20:16,728 --> 00:20:17,737
That's Storm!

205
00:20:18,064 --> 00:20:19,292
And I was one of them.

206
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:22,119
He knocked me out in 13 seconds.

207
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,489
Isn't it, Champ?

208
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,246
Sikandar!
Suraj, all these are old stories.

209
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:29,209
But, he is no less today!
He has worked very hard on himself.

210
00:20:29,368 --> 00:20:31,979
He is the best MMA
fighter in Thunderstorm.

211
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:34,450
I saw him on TV. Not bad.

212
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,653
Oh, really?

213
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:36,949
Not bad!

214
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,609
Come on, then! Let's see.

215
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,772
What does good mean
and who is better?

216
00:20:44,158 --> 00:20:45,370
I have given up fighting.

217
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,353
Why?

218
00:20:46,665 --> 00:20:48,180
Have you lost your power?

219
00:20:48,352 --> 00:20:50,373
- Or did you realize your true place?
- Sikander!

220
00:20:51,468 --> 00:20:53,413
This is not the time
for this useless conversation.

221
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:55,213
He hasn't worn gloves for 3 years.

222
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:57,640
It will be seen later,
who will win and who will lose.

223
00:20:58,512 --> 00:21:01,491
He gave up winning 3 years ago.

224
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:04,014
At that time he was the shining sun.

225
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:06,129
Today, he is the setting sun.

226
00:21:06,206 --> 00:21:07,199
Come on, boss!

227
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,771
Okay, take it. Tell them.

228
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,564
Tell them how much
fire is still left in you.

229
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,468
- Boss, I have given up fighting.
- Boss!

230
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,456
Suraj!

231
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:20,377
This place is for boxers.

232
00:21:20,702 --> 00:21:22,529
That too, only for winners.

233
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:27,358
Don't even think of looking this way,
forget about coming here!

234
00:21:31,595 --> 00:21:32,571
Suraj!

235
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:48,540
'She was looking great!'

236
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:49,751
'Why dinner tonight?'

237
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:53,580
'It's nobody's birthday,
nor anniversary!'

238
00:21:53,717 --> 00:21:54,997
'How can you say that, Bindiya?'

239
00:21:56,017 --> 00:21:58,932
'Don't we go out without an occasion?'

240
00:22:01,575 --> 00:22:04,333
If you don't mind,
can you please open the window?

241
00:22:04,636 --> 00:22:07,298
Sorry, but I'm sensitive to smell.

242
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,919
Maybe you've had a work out,
that's why!

243
00:22:17,822 --> 00:22:19,989
What clothes have you worn today?

244
00:22:21,143 --> 00:22:23,748
It's a greenish T- shirt and...

245
00:22:23,936 --> 00:22:26,788
Silly! I'm not talking about you,
I'm asking about Bindiya!

246
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,067
What do her earrings look like?

247
00:22:32,437 --> 00:22:34,430
- Just like you!
- Really?

248
00:22:35,507 --> 00:22:38,626
Wow! Bindiya is wearing
earrings just like mine.

249
00:22:41,344 --> 00:22:45,409
Okay, now look at the TV and
tell me how Bindiya actually looks!

250
00:22:50,281 --> 00:22:53,172
- I'll just be back.
- Okay

251
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:56,135
'You don't call him a killer,
you call him a murderer!'

252
00:22:57,308 --> 00:22:59,828
'How does it matter whether
he is a killer or a murderer?'

253
00:22:59,949 --> 00:23:02,075
'Will you kill me
now or after dinner?'

254
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:05,156
'Bindiya! A little romance...'

255
00:23:06,006 --> 00:23:07,778
'My romance is not a joke!'

256
00:23:08,863 --> 00:23:12,655
'I am the bindiya (ornament)
on your forehead'

257
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:32,629
Thank you! Bye!

258
00:23:35,937 --> 00:23:36,892
Your...

259
00:23:39,387 --> 00:23:40,165
tiffin.

260
00:23:42,993 --> 00:23:43,793
Thanks!

261
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:46,822
What is inside this?

262
00:23:47,514 --> 00:23:48,141
It's sugar.

263
00:23:48,392 --> 00:23:49,637
What! Why?

264
00:23:52,061 --> 00:23:53,648
- We're equal now.
- Oh, really?

265
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,995
Favor and debt, must be repaid
as soon as possible, Bindiya!

266
00:23:59,143 --> 00:24:02,836
Sometimes, you behave
like Bindiya's husband Jignesh!

267
00:24:04,556 --> 00:24:06,636
Anyway, I'm Jenny!

268
00:24:09,997 --> 00:24:12,987
I'm shaking your hand,
not asking for it!

269
00:24:19,036 --> 00:24:22,368
You are shy like a girl,
but your hand is quite solid.

270
00:24:22,568 --> 00:24:23,860
What do you do?

271
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:28,571
Okay!

272
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,079
Bye! Thanks for the show.

273
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,839
And thanks for the sugar.

274
00:24:36,761 --> 00:24:46,121
"Sounds! Tell me, what are these
sounds that I can hear nowadays"

275
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:54,802
"Knocking! Tell me, why are
these strange moments knocking?"

276
00:24:55,642 --> 00:24:58,242
I'm shaking your hand,
not asking for it!

277
00:24:58,641 --> 00:25:03,231
"There is something
that causes less sleep"

278
00:25:03,508 --> 00:25:08,287
"There is something
that makes the eyes moist"

279
00:25:08,364 --> 00:25:12,995
"There is something,
that if you say so"

280
00:25:13,226 --> 00:25:17,585
"I will lay down
my life with a smile!"

281
00:25:57,131 --> 00:26:06,014
"What can we call that
which exists between us?"

282
00:26:06,804 --> 00:26:15,798
"What is love? It is a wave...
Come, let's flow with it together"

283
00:26:16,056 --> 00:26:20,983
- "Something that makes me lost"
- I'm talking about Bindiya, not you!

284
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:25,893
"There is something
that you could not sleep!"

285
00:26:25,973 --> 00:26:35,540
"There is something that
both of us laughed until we cried!"

286
00:26:58,077 --> 00:27:01,253
Hi! I'm so late!
Please, put the TV on.

287
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:06,338
There's water too?

288
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,731
New shoes?

289
00:27:11,825 --> 00:27:12,486
No.

290
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,395
They're pretty old,
bought them quite sometime ago.

291
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:15,298
Okay.

292
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,938
What is Bindiya going to do today?

293
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,577
She is going to request her husband.

294
00:27:21,842 --> 00:27:24,656
Jignesh is going to leave Bindiya
and go to Singapore for his new job.

295
00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:26,500
Put the TV on, please.

296
00:27:28,633 --> 00:27:31,221
- 'I don't want your money!'
- See? It's already started.

297
00:27:31,421 --> 00:27:35,182
'Why are you crying like this,
darling?'

298
00:27:35,261 --> 00:27:37,582
'I'm doing all this for you.'

299
00:27:37,758 --> 00:27:40,902
'I don't need your money! I need you!'

300
00:27:42,248 --> 00:27:46,619
'No matter what state we are in,
at least we are together.'

301
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,504
'Bindiya will not be able
to live without you, Jignesh!'

302
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:55,954
'She will die!'

303
00:27:57,588 --> 00:28:00,304
'Bindiya!
Please don't say such things.'

304
00:28:01,225 --> 00:28:03,657
'I will die, before you.'

305
00:28:07,391 --> 00:28:10,265
'My life is tied to yours.'

306
00:28:11,086 --> 00:28:11,786
'Please!'

307
00:28:16,024 --> 00:28:17,767
'What should I do?'

308
00:28:18,414 --> 00:28:20,337
Jignesh is not doing the right thing!

309
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,245
You won't ever do that, right?

310
00:28:25,726 --> 00:28:28,188
'I will be paid twice
as much money in Singapore.'

311
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:29,148
What does that mean?

312
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,340
That means that you will not
leave your girlfriend for a new job!

313
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:35,629
'I will work there
and take care of you.'

314
00:28:35,955 --> 00:28:37,148
It depends.

315
00:28:37,813 --> 00:28:38,953
It depends?

316
00:28:39,221 --> 00:28:40,823
What do you mean, it depends?

317
00:28:40,901 --> 00:28:43,846
What is more necessary for you?
Old relationships or a new job?

318
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,910
I will never leave her and go.

319
00:28:49,424 --> 00:28:50,308
Promise?

320
00:28:53,013 --> 00:28:53,934
Promise!

321
00:28:54,711 --> 00:28:55,957
Good!

322
00:28:56,175 --> 00:28:58,103
Your girlfriend is very lucky.

323
00:29:00,664 --> 00:29:02,375
I don't have a girlfriend.

324
00:29:02,736 --> 00:29:06,233
Silly! You don't have one,
but you will one day.

325
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:09,593
Wherever she is today,
she is very lucky.

326
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,277
Because it's you in her life,
not Jignesh.

327
00:29:15,294 --> 00:29:16,193
Handsome?

328
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:20,958
Like a typical Gujju guy, tall, fair!

329
00:29:22,198 --> 00:29:26,059
Silly, I'm not talking about Jignesh,
I'm talking about you!

330
00:29:26,325 --> 00:29:27,877
What do you look like?

331
00:29:28,084 --> 00:29:28,874
Tell me.

332
00:29:29,342 --> 00:29:31,687
Don't bluff because I can't see, okay?

333
00:29:33,699 --> 00:29:38,536
People call me rough and tough.

334
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:43,139
That means you're not very handsome.

335
00:29:45,338 --> 00:29:46,619
Okay, bye!

336
00:30:05,664 --> 00:30:07,266
Ahh! Ouch!

337
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:09,384
Aww!

338
00:30:12,003 --> 00:30:14,665
Don't move! Are you alright?

339
00:30:19,128 --> 00:30:19,922
Oh no.

340
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:34,220
How many days since we became friends?

341
00:30:35,603 --> 00:30:39,803
Since Bindiya apologized to
the time Jignesh goes to Singapore.

342
00:30:40,122 --> 00:30:42,905
That means, 6 days.

343
00:30:43,228 --> 00:30:46,285
And you haven't even told
me your name in these 6 days!

344
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,221
Suraj.

345
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,958
Suraj...

346
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,528
Suraj!

347
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:01,847
Suraj... what?

348
00:31:02,115 --> 00:31:03,606
Suraj Singh Rathore?

349
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:05,846
Suraj Uday Pratap Chauhan!

350
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:08,285
What is your full name?

351
00:31:11,852 --> 00:31:13,914
The one who gave me a name,
only gave me this much.

352
00:31:14,848 --> 00:31:16,966
I have never wanted
to have more than that...

353
00:31:18,135 --> 00:31:20,385
nor was it in my destiny
to have more than that.

354
00:31:20,885 --> 00:31:21,685
Wow!

355
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:25,173
You should be writing the
dialogues of a show like Bindiya.

356
00:31:25,249 --> 00:31:27,849
You narrated your whole
life's history in just one line!

357
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:32,490
But, don't worry. I don't
know about your life until now...

358
00:31:32,723 --> 00:31:35,391
but from now onwards,
Jenny will never let you...

359
00:31:35,468 --> 00:31:37,931
miss Rathore or Chauhan.

360
00:31:38,508 --> 00:31:40,797
If I have made a friend,
I will be a friend until the end.

361
00:32:00,807 --> 00:32:01,814
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

362
00:32:03,987 --> 00:32:05,378
I cannot walk anymore.

363
00:32:06,171 --> 00:32:07,443
Let me sit down for a while.

364
00:32:09,463 --> 00:32:13,135
There is a bench over there.
You can rest there for some time.

365
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:16,616
Careful!

366
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,976
- Careful!
- Thanks.

367
00:32:25,337 --> 00:32:26,055
Listen!

368
00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:29,417
If you want you can go home.

369
00:32:30,025 --> 00:32:34,257
I mean, if there is someone
waiting for you at home.

370
00:32:35,145 --> 00:32:37,538
- If you want, I can...
- What can you do?

371
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:39,698
I mean, I can...

372
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:43,538
You mean, you will carry me
on your shoulders and drop me home?

373
00:32:44,276 --> 00:32:44,939
Right!

374
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:49,419
It's not a bad idea.
But, think about it.

375
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:51,605
You may regret it midway!

376
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,037
Yes, I've thought about it.

377
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:56,955
Okay!

378
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:23,645
- Okay.
- Okay.

379
00:33:41,071 --> 00:33:43,465
- Now?
- Have we passed the garage?

380
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:44,232
Yes.

381
00:33:44,308 --> 00:33:45,794
Now, turn left from here.

382
00:33:47,244 --> 00:33:48,563
Just a little way more.

383
00:33:55,937 --> 00:33:57,131
Have we passed the mosque?

384
00:33:57,349 --> 00:33:58,189
Yes.

385
00:33:59,112 --> 00:33:59,988
Yes, that's gone too.

386
00:34:00,408 --> 00:34:01,710
Then, we've reached.

387
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,428
No, no. I mean almost reached.

388
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,068
See, there is a broken
down beauty parlor on the left.

389
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:08,927
Yes.

390
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:12,190
There some stairs just ahead of it.

391
00:34:13,004 --> 00:34:13,797
Yes.

392
00:34:14,755 --> 00:34:15,856
It's above those stairs.

393
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,750
Upstairs?

394
00:34:20,914 --> 00:34:23,086
If you're tired, I'll manage.

395
00:34:31,551 --> 00:34:33,872
That's it.
Can you see that gate on the left?

396
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:35,763
- Yes.
- We have to go inside there.

397
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:49,314
Not here! Just one floor above.

398
00:34:52,796 --> 00:34:54,141
What happened?
Are you tired?

399
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,667
You said, you were a tough guy!

400
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:04,462
Perfect! Just here.

401
00:35:05,482 --> 00:35:06,726
Ouch!

402
00:35:16,595 --> 00:35:17,567
I'll go.

403
00:35:19,478 --> 00:35:20,598
Just a minute.

404
00:35:21,998 --> 00:35:24,046
Can you just do me one last favor?

405
00:35:24,784 --> 00:35:25,678
Please.

406
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,315
There is a cloth stuck here.

407
00:35:35,392 --> 00:35:36,450
A cloth?

408
00:35:39,586 --> 00:35:40,848
It's an innerwear.

409
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:47,395
Thanks!

410
00:36:01,885 --> 00:36:03,083
One minute!

411
00:36:13,514 --> 00:36:14,041
Here.

412
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:16,715
Two tickets to the music concert.

413
00:36:17,004 --> 00:36:19,925
Consider it a gift
for dropping me here.

414
00:36:21,205 --> 00:36:23,396
I don't like music.

415
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,086
And there is no one
to go along with me.

416
00:36:28,448 --> 00:36:33,726
I could have gone with you,
but you don't like music, so.

417
00:36:34,911 --> 00:36:35,694
No!

418
00:36:37,526 --> 00:36:38,804
It's not like that.

419
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:42,237
We can go.

420
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:44,202
I'll pick you up.

421
00:37:29,183 --> 00:37:30,057
Thank you.

422
00:38:11,493 --> 00:38:12,320
Hi!

423
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,694
Should we go?

424
00:38:24,699 --> 00:38:32,022
"Playing the guitar with twist melody"

425
00:38:32,384 --> 00:38:35,307
"The youngster become impatient"

426
00:38:35,552 --> 00:38:38,061
"The quick and fast rhythm"

427
00:38:38,138 --> 00:38:39,062
The concert is there.

428
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:42,261
"Their hearts leap with joy"

429
00:38:42,338 --> 00:38:44,582
"Searching for partners"

430
00:38:45,346 --> 00:38:47,882
"What a beautiful rhythm"

431
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:52,705
"All are welcome to dance"

432
00:38:53,934 --> 00:38:55,864
I have come to a concert
after a long time.

433
00:38:56,422 --> 00:38:57,504
Thank you, Suraj.

434
00:38:57,863 --> 00:39:00,001
There is an Indian
restaurant close by.

435
00:39:00,384 --> 00:39:02,544
I used to go there
with someone special.

436
00:39:03,705 --> 00:39:04,747
My first love!

437
00:39:05,705 --> 00:39:07,593
I don't know whether
it's still here.

438
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:26,928
Who was he?

439
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,908
Who?

440
00:39:29,727 --> 00:39:32,787
Your first love?

441
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:38,182
Silly!

442
00:39:38,514 --> 00:39:39,929
I was talking about my dad.

443
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,842
This was his favorite place.
We came here very often.

444
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:50,834
Enough about me.
Tell me about yourself.

445
00:39:50,963 --> 00:39:52,511
Were you always like this?

446
00:39:52,971 --> 00:39:55,471
Haughty and speaking very little?

447
00:39:55,912 --> 00:39:57,298
The serious kind?

448
00:39:57,543 --> 00:40:00,151
Or did you have a humorous side?

449
00:40:08,914 --> 00:40:12,673
You know, Bindiya says,
that people who speak less...

450
00:40:13,115 --> 00:40:15,654
have a volcano of
memories in them.

451
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:19,113
They keep on moving
around in those memories.

452
00:40:19,705 --> 00:40:21,468
Do you have anything like that?

453
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,115
You know, Bindiya also says...

454
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:29,274
people who speak less
are either very nice...

455
00:40:29,435 --> 00:40:30,875
or very evil.

456
00:40:31,161 --> 00:40:34,305
They can die for somebody
or they can kill for them too.

457
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:39,025
And I have heard that blind people
talk more than necessary!

458
00:40:56,453 --> 00:40:59,689
We lost track of time
while talking.

459
00:41:03,777 --> 00:41:04,891
I need to leave.

460
00:41:26,593 --> 00:41:28,804
Suraj, now you are our only hope.

461
00:41:29,147 --> 00:41:32,403
Sikandar ditched us to
make more money.

462
00:41:32,987 --> 00:41:35,403
Now, forget everything
and come back to us.

463
00:41:35,591 --> 00:41:38,004
Because, if you're in the race,
we're in the race.

464
00:41:38,244 --> 00:41:39,953
These hands will never
be raised on anybody.

465
00:41:40,392 --> 00:41:41,933
I told you, didn't I?

466
00:41:43,571 --> 00:41:46,205
We're wasting our time with him.

467
00:41:47,845 --> 00:41:49,645
If he was one of my own...

468
00:41:50,586 --> 00:41:52,610
he would come at least once to
check on how I am.

469
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:58,353
He wouldn't have disappeared
for three years after destroying me.

470
00:42:00,176 --> 00:42:02,822
This is not the man
whom I considered my son!

471
00:42:02,966 --> 00:42:03,805
I was in jail.

472
00:42:11,009 --> 00:42:14,363
I was in a jail in Kuala Lumpur
for 2 years and 7 months.

473
00:42:18,011 --> 00:42:21,306
Winning that fight 3 years ago
was not only your dream.

474
00:42:21,768 --> 00:42:22,686
It was mine too!

475
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,933
The date of the fight
is fixed, Suraj.

476
00:42:26,197 --> 00:42:28,899
Just know that I am taking
the biggest risk of my life.

477
00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:30,970
You are confident, aren't you?

478
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:33,364
Oh come on, boss! If he wants...

479
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:36,530
he can break anybody's jaws and
put the teeth on a table before you.

480
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:37,570
Right, Suraj?

481
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:41,450
Now that you have taken an advance,
then why be scared?

482
00:42:41,672 --> 00:42:42,732
Hey!

483
00:42:47,122 --> 00:42:50,227
The night before the fight
a woman came to me.

484
00:42:53,124 --> 00:42:54,412
My name is Natasha.

485
00:42:54,945 --> 00:42:56,916
And she asked me to lose the fight.

486
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:59,493
I have only one daughter, Alisha.

487
00:42:59,733 --> 00:43:02,934
She told me that my opponent
Ali's daughter had cancer.

488
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,848
And that if I won the fight...

489
00:43:05,971 --> 00:43:08,491
he would never be able to
get her medical treatment.

490
00:43:13,077 --> 00:43:14,823
Please save her.

491
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,272
Please.

492
00:43:36,937 --> 00:43:38,834
You have come to the wrong address.

493
00:43:54,738 --> 00:43:56,020
Come on, Suraj!

494
00:44:02,898 --> 00:44:04,162
Yeah!

495
00:44:04,582 --> 00:44:06,756
Suraj!

496
00:44:06,964 --> 00:44:08,795
Suraj!

497
00:44:08,982 --> 00:44:11,295
Suraj!

498
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:13,649
Suraj!

499
00:44:17,882 --> 00:44:18,924
Dad!

500
00:44:22,824 --> 00:44:26,425
Dad! Dad!

501
00:44:26,815 --> 00:44:27,820
Dad!

502
00:44:29,535 --> 00:44:31,735
- Come on, Suraj!
- What is he doing!?

503
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,650
Dad!

504
00:44:39,765 --> 00:44:41,066
Hit him more!

505
00:44:47,786 --> 00:44:48,937
Dad!

506
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,099
One!

507
00:44:57,954 --> 00:44:59,966
I had almost won that fight!

508
00:45:00,752 --> 00:45:03,668
But, when I saw that
little girl's innocent face

509
00:45:04,449 --> 00:45:06,189
I stopped fighting.

510
00:45:07,165 --> 00:45:11,352
I thought, I would have
other fights to win.

511
00:45:12,372 --> 00:45:16,325
But, that little girl had
only one life to live.

512
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,164
Suraj!

513
00:45:24,915 --> 00:45:27,333
Yay! Dad won!

514
00:45:34,879 --> 00:45:37,114
For the first time,
I wasn't sad to lose.

515
00:45:37,982 --> 00:45:39,313
I had saved a life.

516
00:45:39,393 --> 00:45:41,862
Suraj! What was this, Suraj?

517
00:45:42,101 --> 00:45:43,633
Why are you asking him?

518
00:45:43,709 --> 00:45:46,836
He's lost and hiding out here.

519
00:45:47,142 --> 00:45:50,233
You led down the one who
mentored you!

520
00:45:50,355 --> 00:45:52,434
You wanted money, didn't you?

521
00:45:52,514 --> 00:45:55,235
You could have asked me!
I would have given you money.

522
00:45:55,367 --> 00:45:57,579
You have destroyed me!

523
00:46:13,753 --> 00:46:14,830
What are you doing here?

524
00:46:16,557 --> 00:46:18,477
Hey, you!
Don't touch her.

525
00:46:18,752 --> 00:46:19,911
Who are you?

526
00:46:19,987 --> 00:46:21,766
Don't dare touch my kid...

527
00:46:22,259 --> 00:46:24,900
You talk to me,
if you want her, okay?

528
00:46:25,443 --> 00:46:28,264
Then, I realized that all
this was a drama.

529
00:46:53,636 --> 00:46:56,336
Everything inside me
died that day.

530
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:59,924
I decided, I would
become an evil man.

531
00:47:03,077 --> 00:47:05,957
So evil, that I forgot myself!

532
00:47:07,636 --> 00:47:10,071
After my fighting license
got cancelled...

533
00:47:10,919 --> 00:47:13,173
I started fighting
outside the ring.

534
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:15,539
I started doing extortion work.

535
00:47:18,165 --> 00:47:19,847
Hey what do you want?

536
00:47:24,027 --> 00:47:25,545
Why did you go to jail?

537
00:47:29,493 --> 00:47:31,366
It was the last night of the year.

538
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,779
Or maybe the first morning of
the new year.

539
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:39,567
Everybody was welcoming
the new year.

540
00:47:39,824 --> 00:47:43,092
And I was just doing my work.

541
00:47:53,793 --> 00:47:56,771
Don't come close to me.

542
00:47:57,053 --> 00:47:58,409
I give you money.

543
00:47:59,114 --> 00:48:00,686
That's all I have.

544
00:48:01,124 --> 00:48:02,406
I have no more money.

545
00:48:04,733 --> 00:48:06,173
'Foreign language.'

546
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,305
'Foreign language.'

547
00:48:10,661 --> 00:48:12,506
'Foreign language.'

548
00:48:20,615 --> 00:48:21,776
Open the door!

549
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,900
Police!

550
00:48:24,846 --> 00:48:27,844
Open the door!
We have complaints against you.

551
00:48:28,088 --> 00:48:29,397
Open the door!

552
00:48:30,835 --> 00:48:32,000
Open the door!

553
00:48:35,152 --> 00:48:36,414
Open the door!

554
00:49:02,647 --> 00:49:04,758
I still look after him.

555
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:10,019
So that the wounds on my heart
heal with the wounds on his body.

556
00:49:10,637 --> 00:49:14,914
Suraj, the handicapped children
of my orphanage have made this.

557
00:49:15,412 --> 00:49:17,093
Do you have a girlfriend?

558
00:49:17,968 --> 00:49:19,391
Go give this to her.

559
00:49:19,822 --> 00:49:21,789
The love between you will double.

560
00:49:22,455 --> 00:49:23,412
God bless!

561
00:49:49,064 --> 00:49:52,548
- Celebrate tonight.
- Who is it?

562
00:49:53,614 --> 00:49:54,570
Who's there?

563
00:49:58,479 --> 00:50:00,026
It's me, Jenny darling!

564
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:02,668
Mr. Chang!
What are you doing here?

565
00:50:03,008 --> 00:50:05,064
I've been waiting for you.

566
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:07,310
- Let's go!
- Mr. Chang.

567
00:50:27,084 --> 00:50:30,587
I have got my own juice.

568
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:34,968
- Mr. Chang, please leave!
- You can forget about your juice.

569
00:50:37,927 --> 00:50:39,485
Let us have fun.

570
00:50:39,751 --> 00:50:43,115
I brought for our
special night tonight.

571
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:45,270
Please leave.
We'll talk in the office tomorrow.

572
00:50:45,348 --> 00:50:46,077
No!

573
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:51,873
Tonight, you listen to me!

574
00:50:53,431 --> 00:50:56,949
You must stay here
and drink this.

575
00:50:59,746 --> 00:51:00,558
No!

576
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:11,493
I'll see to it,
that we will party tonight.

577
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:13,538
Get out! Mr. Chang,
leave!

578
00:51:18,427 --> 00:51:20,744
How dare you insult me?

579
00:51:21,648 --> 00:51:24,184
You never cared about my feelings.

580
00:51:25,098 --> 00:51:30,167
I'll make sure,
you don't do this to me anymore.

581
00:51:30,842 --> 00:51:32,702
Just leave! Get out!

582
00:51:37,474 --> 00:51:38,676
Son of a...

583
00:51:39,074 --> 00:51:39,673
Get out!

584
00:51:39,749 --> 00:51:40,580
Suraj!

585
00:51:45,274 --> 00:51:46,113
Suraj, no!

586
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:48,985
No!

587
00:51:49,453 --> 00:51:50,397
No!

588
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,358
- Stop it!
- This time I've broken your fingers.

589
00:51:53,495 --> 00:51:55,158
Next time, I'll break
your freaking neck!

590
00:51:55,294 --> 00:51:56,717
Suraj, please stop!

591
00:52:08,176 --> 00:52:09,800
Why did you do that, Suraj?

592
00:52:10,806 --> 00:52:12,178
He's my boss!

593
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,081
Tomorrow, he will tell
the entire management.

594
00:52:17,443 --> 00:52:19,109
I will lose my job!

595
00:52:19,294 --> 00:52:20,912
Do you still want to work with him?

596
00:52:21,186 --> 00:52:22,472
Then what else should I do?

597
00:52:24,073 --> 00:52:25,878
Is there any place in the world...

598
00:52:26,106 --> 00:52:28,779
where a single girl
is not harassed?

599
00:52:30,326 --> 00:52:33,530
Is there any office where
bosses like him don't exist?

600
00:52:35,178 --> 00:52:36,782
Should I leave my job?

601
00:52:37,065 --> 00:52:38,865
Should I give up living my life?

602
00:52:39,054 --> 00:52:41,394
Who will take care
of my expenses?

603
00:52:42,609 --> 00:52:44,466
- I will look after you.
- Why?

604
00:52:47,794 --> 00:52:49,617
Who are you to me?

605
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,015
Who am I to you?

606
00:53:01,828 --> 00:53:03,577
You cannot do anything, Suraj.

607
00:53:05,314 --> 00:53:07,365
Apart from increasing my troubles.

608
00:53:09,926 --> 00:53:11,240
Please, leave me alone.

609
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:19,225
Please! Leave me alone.

610
00:53:21,563 --> 00:53:27,628
"Why do I choose you every moment
among all the others?"

611
00:53:30,786 --> 00:53:37,017
"Why do I weave dreams
of you every moment?"

612
00:53:39,973 --> 00:53:45,171
"Why do I choose you every moment
among all the others?"

613
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:49,932
"Why do I weave dreams of
you every moment?"

614
00:53:50,111 --> 00:53:54,473
"You taught me the art of living"

615
00:53:54,729 --> 00:53:58,719
"Gave me the patience
to silently bear things"

616
00:53:59,046 --> 00:54:03,794
"You are the faith of life"

617
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:06,494
"You are my courage"

618
00:54:06,677 --> 00:54:12,641
"You taught me the art of
living and dying"

619
00:54:12,893 --> 00:54:17,161
"My loyalty to you
has made me like you"

620
00:54:17,499 --> 00:54:21,815
"You taught me the art of
living and dying"

621
00:54:22,066 --> 00:54:27,245
"My loyalty to you has
made me like you"

622
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:55,998
"My loneliness is lost
in thoughts of you"

623
00:54:56,945 --> 00:55:04,618
"Now, my soul is
looking after you"

624
00:55:13,046 --> 00:55:21,500
"My loneliness is lost
in thoughts of you"

625
00:55:22,304 --> 00:55:31,003
"Now, my soul is looking
after you"

626
00:55:31,231 --> 00:55:38,596
"You are the faith of life
and you are my courage"

627
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:44,785
"You taught me the art of
living and dying"

628
00:55:45,056 --> 00:55:50,077
"My loyalty to you
has made me like you"

629
00:55:52,372 --> 00:56:01,188
"Why do I choose you every moment
among all the others?"

630
00:56:02,086 --> 00:56:09,700
"Why do I weave dreams
of you every moment?"

631
00:56:11,279 --> 00:56:18,430
"You taught me the art of living"

632
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:25,807
"Gave me the patience
to silently bear things"

633
00:56:26,609 --> 00:56:33,568
"You are the faith of life"

634
00:56:34,312 --> 00:56:38,794
"You are my courage"

635
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:50,815
Hi!

636
00:56:51,864 --> 00:56:52,453
Hi!

637
00:56:54,732 --> 00:56:59,435
I thought about it
the whole day and left my job.

638
00:57:02,765 --> 00:57:03,448
Good!

639
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:08,134
Now, I'm not used to sitting at home.

640
00:57:08,462 --> 00:57:10,023
So, I thought I'd ask you...

641
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,211
will you take me out this weekend?

642
00:57:16,748 --> 00:57:19,096
You said,
you would look after me.

643
00:57:20,929 --> 00:57:21,824
Always!

644
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:34,238
The orphanage where
I grew up was here.

645
00:57:35,103 --> 00:57:37,004
And then one day, a storm came...

646
00:57:37,999 --> 00:57:40,177
and everything
got washed away.

647
00:57:40,845 --> 00:57:45,254
Now, whenever I'm lonely, or...

648
00:57:46,066 --> 00:57:49,786
I am sad,
then I come here.

649
00:57:54,677 --> 00:57:56,635
Are you lonely and sad
today as well?

650
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,030
No!

651
00:58:03,603 --> 00:58:05,118
For the first time today...

652
00:58:06,362 --> 00:58:08,944
I have come to share
my happiness with this place.

653
00:58:22,805 --> 00:58:23,554
Found it?

654
00:58:23,774 --> 00:58:24,476
Umm-hmm.

655
00:58:29,164 --> 00:58:29,917
Carefully!

656
00:58:30,989 --> 00:58:32,013
Perfect!

657
00:58:35,327 --> 00:58:37,589
Now, this is the foundation
of our home.

658
00:58:37,788 --> 00:58:38,896
Okay? Wait.

659
00:58:45,325 --> 00:58:48,568
These pebbles are the symbol
of the foundation.

660
00:58:52,274 --> 00:58:53,952
Always keep them with you.

661
00:58:54,404 --> 00:58:56,373
They will always remind you of me.

662
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:59,548
And this, I will always keep with me.

663
00:59:02,469 --> 00:59:05,553
I will also come here to share
my happiness and sorrow.

664
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,829
And you will find me here.

665
00:59:15,723 --> 00:59:18,130
But you didn't want to raise
your hand, right?

666
00:59:21,172 --> 00:59:22,369
Now let it go, my friend.

667
00:59:22,501 --> 00:59:24,433
You son is home,
give him your blessings.

668
00:59:24,772 --> 00:59:26,372
Stop asking useless questions!

669
00:59:26,853 --> 00:59:28,295
I want an answer.

670
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:32,198
He wants to settle down.

671
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:34,319
He has fallen in love.

672
00:59:43,797 --> 00:59:46,180
But explain to him
very clearly...

673
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:50,861
his love should not come
in the way of my boxing.

674
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:15,298
"Rise! Young lad"

675
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:21,182
"Blood speaks!"

676
01:00:25,252 --> 01:00:28,793
"Filled in each and every vein"

677
01:00:30,646 --> 01:00:35,587
"passion speaks"

678
01:00:47,473 --> 01:00:52,141
"Rise, young lad. The blood speaks,
the passion in your veins speaks"

679
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:57,083
"Comes let's make up an iron mind,
and say the word"

680
01:00:57,225 --> 01:00:59,642
"Let's fill the cage
with passion of winning..."

681
01:00:59,719 --> 01:01:01,860
"Let's love the pain"

682
01:01:02,064 --> 01:01:06,690
"Become crazy, take courage to a high
and make all our difficulties easy"

683
01:01:06,824 --> 01:01:11,705
"Stay awake the whole night, dream
with open eyes - this is my curse"

684
01:01:11,786 --> 01:01:16,400
"Make all our difficulties disappear"

685
01:01:16,574 --> 01:01:22,483
"The sweat of blood,
my chest swells with my courage"

686
01:01:24,154 --> 01:01:26,782
This is our new home.

687
01:01:28,528 --> 01:01:31,951
There is a sweet little
balcony over here.

688
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:33,235
From here...

689
01:01:33,312 --> 01:01:35,577
From where the sunshine
comes straight inside.

690
01:01:35,721 --> 01:01:36,810
How do you know?

691
01:01:42,082 --> 01:01:45,655
I have always seen the sun
without my eyes.

692
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:48,467
But, the sun has never
looked into my eyes.

693
01:01:49,648 --> 01:01:51,303
Look into my eyes, Suraj.

694
01:01:53,191 --> 01:01:54,369
You are looking into them, right?

695
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:56,245
Yes.

696
01:01:57,383 --> 01:01:58,282
Lies!

697
01:02:01,232 --> 01:02:03,478
I can see everything
even without sight.

698
01:02:04,169 --> 01:02:07,953
And even though
you have eyes...

699
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:26,034
'Foreign language.'

700
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:28,147
The one who will look
after me has arrived.

701
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,645
Now, I can come
every day to help you.

702
01:02:34,007 --> 01:02:38,746
"Rise, young lad. The blood speaks,
the passion in your veins speaks"

703
01:02:38,876 --> 01:02:43,562
"Let's die and let's
say the word"

704
01:02:43,743 --> 01:02:48,349
"Like a heart of iron,
a gypsy who loves pain"

705
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:53,196
"Become crazy, take courage to a high
and make all our difficulties easy"

706
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:58,079
"Stay awake the whole night, dream
with open eyes, this is my curse"

707
01:02:58,269 --> 01:03:02,324
"Let's break together and make
all our difficulties disappear"

708
01:03:03,069 --> 01:03:07,439
"The sweat of blood, my chest swells
with my courage"

709
01:03:07,592 --> 01:03:12,680
"Let's break together and make
all our difficulties disappear"

710
01:03:12,821 --> 01:03:16,612
"The sweat of blood, my chest swells
with my courage"

711
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:17,891
Tell me more.

712
01:03:18,276 --> 01:03:19,126
Suraj!

713
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:31,062
Okay, Stop! Suraj, no!

714
01:03:31,577 --> 01:03:33,283
Okay. Time out! Time out!

715
01:03:33,404 --> 01:03:36,499
Time out! Turn around!

716
01:03:41,959 --> 01:03:44,818
Looks like you didn't find any
patient in the hospital on Sunday.

717
01:03:45,181 --> 01:03:46,393
Just shut up!

718
01:03:46,946 --> 01:03:49,283
You boxers are
are as good as patients.

719
01:03:55,686 --> 01:03:57,481
You know, your back is really weird.

720
01:03:58,722 --> 01:04:00,450
The curve between
your lumbar spine...

721
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:04,675
and the thoracic spine
is very little.

722
01:04:04,909 --> 01:04:06,597
So, there is a problem
even with my back!

723
01:04:06,772 --> 01:04:09,826
While massaging, you've begun to
imagine yourself as a doctor!

724
01:04:10,141 --> 01:04:11,847
- Doctor Jenny!
- Obviously!

725
01:04:11,978 --> 01:04:13,248
I'm a qualified nurse.

726
01:04:13,387 --> 01:04:16,133
They won't even let me enter
the hospital without this knowledge.

727
01:04:18,528 --> 01:04:20,608
If we collect some money...

728
01:04:21,377 --> 01:04:24,808
then I could open
a little school for you.

729
01:04:25,043 --> 01:04:26,008
How sweet!

730
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:30,014
So that you can spend
some time with your art...

731
01:04:31,215 --> 01:04:32,624
and not just with your patients.

732
01:04:32,748 --> 01:04:34,987
Oh! And who will you
spend your time with?

733
01:04:35,302 --> 01:04:36,286
Let me think.

734
01:04:39,596 --> 01:04:40,522
What should I say?

735
01:04:41,129 --> 01:04:42,134
You'll think?

736
01:04:42,895 --> 01:04:43,979
Are you serious?

737
01:04:46,026 --> 01:04:46,773
No.

738
01:04:49,336 --> 01:04:57,297
"The threads of a relationship between
us are beginning to take shape"

739
01:04:58,522 --> 01:05:06,950
"My uneasiness has now begun to
find some peacefulness"

740
01:05:14,362 --> 01:05:22,896
"The threads of a relationship between
us are beginning to take shape"

741
01:05:23,768 --> 01:05:32,429
"My uneasiness has now begun
to find some peacefulness"

742
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:40,298
"You are my faith in life,
you are my courage"

743
01:05:40,542 --> 01:05:46,474
"You taught me how
to live and die"

744
01:05:46,682 --> 01:05:50,925
"My faith has made me like you"

745
01:05:51,307 --> 01:05:55,699
"You taught me how to live and die"

746
01:05:55,911 --> 01:06:00,605
"My faith has made me like you"

747
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,295
Suraj!

748
01:06:07,139 --> 01:06:08,401
You have done this, right?

749
01:06:08,644 --> 01:06:10,541
How dare you?
Hold this.

750
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:21,969
I'm sorry!

751
01:06:30,375 --> 01:06:31,684
Silly boy!

752
01:06:33,218 --> 01:06:36,361
We live in Malaysia.
But, we're still Indians.

753
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:40,017
Who is going to seek permission
from my parents?

754
01:06:52,331 --> 01:06:53,664
Ask them, silly.

755
01:07:08,153 --> 01:07:10,557
I don't speak too much.

756
01:07:11,378 --> 01:07:12,959
I will only say that...

757
01:07:17,574 --> 01:07:19,668
I will keep your
daughter very happy.

758
01:08:09,782 --> 01:08:12,798
You never told me
how they died.

759
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:15,403
What should I say?

760
01:08:16,307 --> 01:08:18,112
It was the first
night of the New Year.

761
01:08:21,233 --> 01:08:24,373
But for me, that night left behind
a lifetime of darkness.

762
01:08:29,989 --> 01:08:33,279
Dad had stopped all his urgent work
and was with us since two days.

763
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:51,530
And I was driving.

764
01:08:56,453 --> 01:08:59,545
And then that
fateful accident happened.

765
01:10:04,028 --> 01:10:07,393
But for me, that night left
behind a lifetime of darkness.

766
01:10:15,953 --> 01:10:18,087
My parents always wanted
the best for me.

767
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:22,613
They worry about me even
though they have gone so far away.

768
01:10:24,478 --> 01:10:26,946
That's why they found you
and sent you to me.

769
01:10:34,489 --> 01:10:36,211
Thanks for coming
in my life, Suraj.

770
01:11:25,249 --> 01:11:26,235
Jenny!

771
01:11:28,189 --> 01:11:29,700
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Jenny Mathias.

772
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:31,473
Oh! Okay. Ask the doctor.

773
01:11:32,099 --> 01:11:33,004
Okay, thank you, sir.

774
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,902
Excuse me doctor,
I'm with Jenny Mathias.

775
01:11:35,018 --> 01:11:36,582
- Oh, Hi.
- Is she okay?

776
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:40,413
It was a little cut, not too much.

777
01:11:40,627 --> 01:11:43,982
She was lucky you know,
because the piece didn't dig in.

778
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:48,619
- Can I take her home?
- Sure!

779
01:11:48,724 --> 01:11:52,184
But remember, next time,
don't leave her alone. Alright?

780
01:11:53,153 --> 01:11:53,823
Okay?

781
01:11:53,921 --> 01:11:55,881
- Thank you, doctor.
- You're welcome.

782
01:11:57,248 --> 01:12:00,225
Oh! Why did you come?
I was about to come home.

783
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:02,534
It's nothing!
It's just a cut.

784
01:12:21,685 --> 01:12:24,425
It's cornea damage,
causing visual impairment.

785
01:12:25,159 --> 01:12:29,085
But, sight can be restored in
such cases with an operation.

786
01:12:29,649 --> 01:12:30,371
Really?

787
01:12:30,622 --> 01:12:31,228
Yes!

788
01:12:31,725 --> 01:12:34,273
But, you have already
delayed it too much.

789
01:12:34,626 --> 01:12:35,509
What do you mean?

790
01:12:36,353 --> 01:12:38,589
That means, 15 - 20 days.

791
01:12:39,182 --> 01:12:40,650
One month at the maximum.

792
01:12:41,037 --> 01:12:43,747
After that, even this operation
would be useless.

793
01:12:44,206 --> 01:12:46,150
If the operation is done
within a month, then...

794
01:12:46,226 --> 01:12:48,310
can the sight in her eyes
be restored?

795
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:52,153
Yes, but we will have
to import the cornea from the US.

796
01:12:53,942 --> 01:12:54,946
What will the expenditure be?

797
01:13:07,001 --> 01:13:08,158
Come on, suraj.

798
01:13:09,247 --> 01:13:10,339
Suraj!

799
01:13:11,798 --> 01:13:12,634
Come on.

800
01:13:24,568 --> 01:13:26,288
Come on, breathe!
Breathe!

801
01:13:26,695 --> 01:13:28,435
Defend yourself,
get him on the jaw!

802
01:13:28,552 --> 01:13:29,798
Why don't you elbow him?

803
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:32,219
Come on! Don't hold back.

804
01:13:40,172 --> 01:13:41,505
Come on!

805
01:13:49,126 --> 01:13:50,370
Come on!

806
01:13:54,581 --> 01:13:55,533
Suraj!

807
01:14:08,222 --> 01:14:08,919
Yes.

808
01:14:09,414 --> 01:14:12,125
- Well done.
- Good job, my boy.

809
01:14:13,881 --> 01:14:16,079
Until Jenny gets her eyes back...

810
01:14:17,318 --> 01:14:19,439
I will keep thinking
about this, Omi.

811
01:14:19,614 --> 01:14:21,828
I need a lot of money for that.

812
01:14:22,405 --> 01:14:24,859
Suraj, who doesn't need money?

813
01:14:25,713 --> 01:14:27,660
But, Srikant is not
in the right shape.

814
01:14:27,865 --> 01:14:30,003
Neither can he help you, nor can I.

815
01:14:30,467 --> 01:14:32,218
But, you can't let that affect
you, friend.

816
01:14:36,003 --> 01:14:39,957
And you will never get
any money fighting for them.

817
01:14:40,484 --> 01:14:43,209
I saw you fighting, not bad.

818
01:14:43,548 --> 01:14:48,392
One should not be angry with a man
who sells his soul for money...

819
01:14:48,507 --> 01:14:49,859
one should pity him.

820
01:14:50,591 --> 01:14:52,612
I trained him for 2 years.

821
01:14:53,361 --> 01:14:55,976
But, he still left and joined
Gavin's club for money.

822
01:14:56,369 --> 01:14:57,645
Let's see how long
he stays there.

823
01:14:57,787 --> 01:15:01,316
I got what I didn't get in 2 years,
within 2 weeks.

824
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:05,575
When you are fed up of
fighting this small fights...

825
01:15:06,491 --> 01:15:08,460
and feel like fighting
with a real man...

826
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:11,127
then come to me.

827
01:15:12,379 --> 01:15:13,804
You will get money.

828
01:15:14,395 --> 01:15:16,869
And all your desires
will also be fulfilled.

829
01:15:26,953 --> 01:15:28,407
Think about it, there will be pain.

830
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:30,668
Jenny will be more hurt,
if she touches it.

831
01:15:32,939 --> 01:15:34,164
Your wish!

832
01:15:47,911 --> 01:15:49,318
I was thinking about you.

833
01:15:53,463 --> 01:15:56,572
I've told you so many times not to
do all this work when I am not home.

834
01:15:59,229 --> 01:16:02,053
But, I can't get anything done
when you are around.

835
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:07,654
Suraj! What happened?

836
01:16:08,863 --> 01:16:10,134
Are you alright, Suraj?

837
01:16:11,007 --> 01:16:11,840
What happened?

838
01:16:12,329 --> 01:16:13,103
Nothing.

839
01:16:14,234 --> 01:16:15,874
Oh! I'm absolutely fine.

840
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:17,121
100%.

841
01:16:21,515 --> 01:16:22,533
If I could see...

842
01:16:23,841 --> 01:16:25,845
would you still lie to me like this?

843
01:16:59,654 --> 01:17:01,221
I knew you would come.

844
01:17:02,371 --> 01:17:05,352
I didn't know
it would be that soon.

845
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:06,381
Drink.

846
01:17:07,964 --> 01:17:09,623
I need money, Sikandar.

847
01:17:10,896 --> 01:17:13,371
It is need that takes
a man to his destination.

848
01:17:13,822 --> 01:17:15,279
Tell me, what is your need?

849
01:17:17,112 --> 01:17:17,954
300,000.

850
01:17:18,949 --> 01:17:21,383
That's all? If you work
at Gavin's club...

851
01:17:22,197 --> 01:17:24,747
then your needs will be
fulfilled in 3 or 4 months.

852
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:29,059
Jenny doesn't have
that much time, Sikandar.

853
01:17:29,412 --> 01:17:31,503
I need that money in 15 days.

854
01:17:32,063 --> 01:17:35,083
Gavin never gives such a big advance
even to family!

855
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:41,725
Sit!

856
01:17:47,015 --> 01:17:49,456
Look, now the matter
is about love.

857
01:17:50,345 --> 01:17:52,618
So Sikandar
will have to do something.

858
01:17:54,196 --> 01:17:55,520
If you need a bigger rate...

859
01:17:56,546 --> 01:17:58,147
then you have to do a bigger job.

860
01:17:58,286 --> 01:17:59,161
I will do it.

861
01:18:00,107 --> 01:18:00,900
Cheers!

862
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:51,218
Why are you crying?

863
01:18:51,575 --> 01:18:53,876
Okay dear, sorry!
I shouldn't have brought you here.

864
01:18:54,028 --> 01:18:55,789
I'm not crying because
of that, silly!

865
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:56,526
Then?

866
01:18:57,186 --> 01:19:00,532
I'm crying because you didn't bring
me to such a nice place before!

867
01:19:00,756 --> 01:19:03,294
Come on, let's do it again!
Single ticket, double fun! Come on!

868
01:19:05,228 --> 01:19:06,297
What happened?

869
01:19:09,891 --> 01:19:12,693
The fun would actually have doubled,
if only you were able to see.

870
01:19:13,530 --> 01:19:14,988
You are my eyes!

871
01:19:16,511 --> 01:19:17,188
Come on.

872
01:19:18,858 --> 01:19:21,910
You knew that the operation
would have cured your sight.

873
01:19:24,954 --> 01:19:26,718
What's happened to you?
Come on!

874
01:19:27,207 --> 01:19:30,715
You knew that the cornea
could be imported from the US.

875
01:19:31,331 --> 01:19:33,596
Yes, I knew! But, I also knew...

876
01:19:33,673 --> 01:19:36,520
that it would be impossible to
collect so much money. Let's go.

877
01:19:37,403 --> 01:19:39,142
You could have told me at least.

878
01:19:40,372 --> 01:19:42,628
What's happened to you?
Why are you wasting so much time?

879
01:19:42,706 --> 01:19:44,739
The park will close. Come on!

880
01:19:45,398 --> 01:19:46,760
The doctor has said that...

881
01:19:48,435 --> 01:19:50,525
you have only 15 - 20 days.

882
01:19:51,903 --> 01:19:53,659
- Don't you want...
- No, I don't want.

883
01:19:58,688 --> 01:20:01,512
I don't want to see a world
where my mom and dad don't exist.

884
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,243
Wherever your parents are, they...

885
01:20:09,861 --> 01:20:11,003
will be very sad.

886
01:20:12,152 --> 01:20:16,004
Imagine, how happy they will be,
if you can see again.

887
01:20:16,939 --> 01:20:19,766
And don't you want to
see this silly guy's face?

888
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:26,465
But where will we get
so much money from?

889
01:20:41,582 --> 01:20:42,384
Work!

890
01:20:44,527 --> 01:20:45,865
Can you take a life?

891
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:48,122
Sorry!

892
01:20:49,258 --> 01:20:50,745
Can you give your life?

893
01:21:05,774 --> 01:21:08,272
There is freestyle in Langkawi.

894
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:09,972
Will you play?

895
01:21:10,612 --> 01:21:11,760
That's why I'm here.

896
01:21:12,073 --> 01:21:15,246
But, you have to fight to lose.

897
01:21:18,052 --> 01:21:21,287
And there is no need to tell you
that it is completely illegal!

898
01:21:23,285 --> 01:21:26,304
If you get caught,
the entire responsibility is yours...

899
01:21:27,642 --> 01:21:29,127
and only yours.

900
01:21:51,216 --> 01:21:55,244
I am thinking,
that if I get my sight back...

901
01:21:55,705 --> 01:21:58,276
then we will go to that
lake first.

902
01:21:58,945 --> 01:22:01,210
Where I've laid the
foundation of our home.

903
01:22:02,266 --> 01:22:04,059
Then, I will look at Oscar.

904
01:22:04,305 --> 01:22:07,661
I will look at the sunset,
I will look at the water in the lake.

905
01:22:07,737 --> 01:22:08,567
And me?

906
01:22:09,861 --> 01:22:12,467
I would have already seen you, silly!

907
01:22:13,539 --> 01:22:15,385
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

908
01:22:17,678 --> 01:22:20,241
Suppose I don't turn out like you...

909
01:22:21,207 --> 01:22:22,011
How?

910
01:22:23,442 --> 01:22:25,974
- The way you think I am.
- How do I imagine you?

911
01:22:26,207 --> 01:22:30,219
I mean... you know... like...

912
01:22:31,121 --> 01:22:33,320
You mean, the silly
and ugly types?

913
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:36,604
- You'll be terribly disappointed!
- Really?

914
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:39,530
Because, neither am I ugly,
nor am I silly!

915
01:22:49,419 --> 01:22:51,002
'One more thing...'

916
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:55,542
'if you don't want your
family to land in any trouble...'

917
01:22:57,864 --> 01:23:01,329
'then you have to destroy every
identification that you have.'

918
01:23:02,992 --> 01:23:07,191
'Even your family's life can be
endangered in such illegal fights.'

919
01:23:09,106 --> 01:23:12,425
'So destroy every identification
of yours before you leave.'

920
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:16,223
'So that nobody can trace you.'

921
01:23:19,065 --> 01:23:21,787
'You will get a new name and
passport within two days.'

922
01:23:52,469 --> 01:23:55,586
'You will never leave your
girlfriend for a new job?'

923
01:23:56,295 --> 01:23:57,212
'Promise?'

924
01:24:01,742 --> 01:24:03,488
You've gone out of your mind!

925
01:24:04,152 --> 01:24:06,272
Will you fight for that
ungrateful, Gavin?

926
01:24:06,546 --> 01:24:08,473
- Just this once!
- Oh, really?

927
01:24:09,257 --> 01:24:11,525
And what if you're finished
during that one time?

928
01:24:12,276 --> 01:24:14,555
Suraj, the fight
you're talking about...

929
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:16,690
has 6 out of 10 fighters dying.

930
01:24:17,238 --> 01:24:19,649
The rest are crippled for life.

931
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,646
Otherwise also, I'm not alive
in the real sense of the word!

932
01:24:23,624 --> 01:24:26,082
I cannot bring
back Jenny's parents.

933
01:24:26,706 --> 01:24:29,037
But, if I can bring back
her sight, perhaps...

934
01:24:29,645 --> 01:24:31,320
my guilt will be a little less.

935
01:24:31,758 --> 01:24:33,948
And about having
broken arms and legs...

936
01:24:34,985 --> 01:24:36,805
I am a cripple now, brother.

937
01:24:38,939 --> 01:24:41,001
Your love has finally
gotten in the way!

938
01:24:43,926 --> 01:24:45,819
Actually, love has saved me, Omi!

939
01:24:54,878 --> 01:24:56,708
Take care of yourself.

940
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,566
Can I say something, Suraj?

941
01:25:17,295 --> 01:25:19,341
When the bandage
on my eyes is opened...

942
01:25:20,971 --> 01:25:23,095
don't come in front
of me immediately.

943
01:25:29,455 --> 01:25:33,460
I don't want to suddenly come face to
face with the biggest joy in my life.

944
01:25:45,616 --> 01:25:47,013
And I also want...

945
01:25:48,404 --> 01:25:52,484
that you should be with me
when my sight is restored.

946
01:25:57,514 --> 01:25:59,231
Will you be there, Suraj?

947
01:26:00,506 --> 01:26:01,684
Promise me!

948
01:26:03,598 --> 01:26:05,446
What are you thinking? Promise!

949
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:48,545
Sarfaraz Ahmed...

950
01:26:49,842 --> 01:26:51,052
your new name...

951
01:26:51,532 --> 01:26:53,450
Need another ID, the passport.

952
01:26:56,178 --> 01:26:58,285
Your new phone with new sim card.

953
01:27:00,032 --> 01:27:01,098
'Foreign language.'

954
01:27:33,713 --> 01:27:35,612
Cheating with me...

955
01:27:41,734 --> 01:27:43,738
Normally I don't like
to dirty my hands.

956
01:27:44,029 --> 01:27:45,412
But I know when I have to.

957
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:53,217
Now won't you say,
that's why you came.

958
01:27:53,570 --> 01:27:54,383
To die.

959
01:27:57,303 --> 01:27:58,794
I hope you remember that.

960
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:02,769
Take him away!
Get him ready for the fight.

961
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:52,346
7 minutes!

962
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:56,708
You have 7 minutes to die.

963
01:28:59,113 --> 01:29:02,339
What to do? The rules of
the game are like this.

964
01:29:04,036 --> 01:29:07,157
This fight does not stop until
either man's breath's stops.

965
01:29:08,071 --> 01:29:10,727
And your breath is
mortgaged with me.

966
01:29:11,713 --> 01:29:14,326
From now on each breath of
yours will dance to my tunes.

967
01:29:15,852 --> 01:29:17,055
7 minutes!

968
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:20,268
You will make this game
interesting for 7 minutes.

969
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,817
And then you can
prepare to lose.

970
01:29:25,073 --> 01:29:27,220
That means, get ready to die!

971
01:29:29,154 --> 01:29:32,731
But you are a very lucky man, Suraj.

972
01:29:34,297 --> 01:29:37,013
Because, your fight
is not with an enemy.

973
01:29:37,321 --> 01:29:39,189
But, with your best friend.

974
01:29:40,064 --> 01:29:41,433
So cheer up, come on!

975
01:29:49,504 --> 01:29:50,673
Soup for you.

976
01:29:53,316 --> 01:29:54,538
Did Suraj call?

977
01:29:55,479 --> 01:29:56,103
No.

978
01:29:57,397 --> 01:30:00,188
Nurse, please check again.
He must have surely called!

979
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:50,997
Hit me.

980
01:30:51,932 --> 01:30:53,399
Come on, hit me man.

981
01:33:05,957 --> 01:33:09,138
'For 7 minutes you will
make this game interesting.'

982
01:33:09,366 --> 01:33:11,204
'And then you can prepare to lose.'

983
01:33:14,567 --> 01:33:15,925
'Get ready to die!'

984
01:33:30,501 --> 01:33:32,453
What an amazing girl she must be...

985
01:33:32,647 --> 01:33:35,100
if you're ready to
give your life for her.

986
01:33:35,781 --> 01:33:41,156
Your sacrifice and
her youth won't go in vain.

987
01:33:42,969 --> 01:33:45,030
I will take care of her.

988
01:33:45,494 --> 01:33:46,256
Yes!

989
01:33:52,327 --> 01:33:53,134
Yes!

990
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:01,896
Wait!

991
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:09,261
He came here to die anyway.

992
01:35:09,599 --> 01:35:12,249
But, our loss will not be fulfilled...

993
01:35:12,651 --> 01:35:14,650
by his death his life will do it.

994
01:35:21,083 --> 01:35:24,363
And this time you better do it right!

995
01:35:33,145 --> 01:35:35,992
'I give you one more
chance to live your life.'

996
01:35:37,382 --> 01:35:40,544
'And if my goods do not reach intact.'

997
01:35:41,757 --> 01:35:44,430
'Be ready to lose
your life this time.'

998
01:37:52,771 --> 01:37:54,482
- Suraj?
- No!

999
01:38:01,826 --> 01:38:02,858
Take care.

1000
01:40:00,835 --> 01:40:06,068
"Nobody knows why God
kept these eyes apart"

1001
01:40:07,131 --> 01:40:12,308
"Nobody knows why God
kept these eyes apart"

1002
01:40:13,892 --> 01:40:19,868
"My eyes are brimming
over crying and dying for you"

1003
01:40:20,283 --> 01:40:26,491
"My eyes are brimming
over crying and dying for you"

1004
01:40:26,710 --> 01:40:31,542
"They have forgotten
the ways of life"

1005
01:40:32,283 --> 01:40:37,238
"Nobody knows why God
kept these eyes apart"

1006
01:40:38,679 --> 01:40:43,387
"Nobody knows why God
kept these eyes apart"

1007
01:40:58,279 --> 01:41:04,105
"I am all alone in
this crowded world"

1008
01:41:04,595 --> 01:41:10,355
"I have lost myself,
having lost you after finding you"

1009
01:41:10,866 --> 01:41:16,950
"I am all alone in
this crowded world"

1010
01:41:17,196 --> 01:41:22,789
"I have lost myself,
having lost you after finding you"

1011
01:41:23,294 --> 01:41:29,119
"These days are as
dark as kohl without you"

1012
01:41:29,633 --> 01:41:35,529
"Even the stars are
dim during the night"

1013
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:09,594
- I have reached.
- Sample?

1014
01:42:10,254 --> 01:42:11,093
It's safe.

1015
01:42:11,453 --> 01:42:12,435
Where should I come?

1016
01:42:14,144 --> 01:42:15,560
I have very little time.

1017
01:42:16,913 --> 01:42:19,728
You don't have to come now,
Suraj, you have to go.

1018
01:42:20,247 --> 01:42:22,873
Because,
you really have very little time.

1019
01:43:09,836 --> 01:43:11,530
Excuse me, Dr. Aakash?

1020
01:43:11,892 --> 01:43:12,523
Nurse!

1021
01:43:13,328 --> 01:43:13,975
Suraj?

1022
01:43:14,053 --> 01:43:15,489
He came for my eye surgery.

1023
01:43:16,054 --> 01:43:17,056
You must be remembering him.

1024
01:43:17,134 --> 01:43:18,970
Can we get something
for her from CCTV?

1025
01:43:19,094 --> 01:43:20,731
We have the CCTV footage.

1026
01:43:20,962 --> 01:43:22,664
But it's only for 3 days.

1027
01:43:22,742 --> 01:43:25,106
I'm sure you'll be able
to organize it. Please, doctor.

1028
01:43:25,219 --> 01:43:26,701
- It's really important for me.
- I'm so sorry.

1029
01:43:34,685 --> 01:43:40,649
"My eyes have turned to stone,
looking at the roads and waiting"

1030
01:43:40,981 --> 01:43:46,812
"How did pain come
to the lips of happiness?"

1031
01:43:47,251 --> 01:43:53,415
"My eyes have turned to stone,
looking at the roads and waiting"

1032
01:43:53,634 --> 01:43:59,338
"How did pain come
to the lips of happiness?"

1033
01:43:59,739 --> 01:44:05,814
"My dreams sulk, our hearts
joined and then my heart has broken"

1034
01:44:06,022 --> 01:44:11,297
"Even the destiny lines
on my palms have broken!"

1035
01:44:11,950 --> 01:44:16,868
"Nobody knows why God
kept these eyes apart"

1036
01:44:18,267 --> 01:44:23,239
"Nobody knows why God
kept these eyes apart"

1037
01:44:50,794 --> 01:44:52,303
Hi! May I help you?

1038
01:44:52,557 --> 01:44:53,890
Hi! I'm Kabir.

1039
01:44:54,518 --> 01:44:57,527
I have heard a lot about
you and your creative soldiers.

1040
01:44:58,172 --> 01:45:02,416
I have to admit your designs
are just as beautiful as you.

1041
01:45:03,101 --> 01:45:06,114
Thank you, but this work is
done by the children of the institute.

1042
01:45:06,451 --> 01:45:08,193
- Come inside.
- Someone's trying to be modest.

1043
01:45:08,410 --> 01:45:10,622
You are the one teaching these kids.

1044
01:45:11,114 --> 01:45:13,425
Anyway, I own a fitness club.

1045
01:45:13,870 --> 01:45:17,435
I need some gifts for my staff
for New Year's. Is it possible?

1046
01:45:17,513 --> 01:45:19,136
Yes! Absolutely!

1047
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:21,883
Do you just want to
go through the brochure?

1048
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:25,760
When I see you so happy,
I am sure of one thing.

1049
01:45:26,023 --> 01:45:26,666
What?

1050
01:45:26,979 --> 01:45:28,731
That you are not married!

1051
01:45:29,986 --> 01:45:30,723
Sorry!

1052
01:45:30,854 --> 01:45:33,149
But, I am married
and very happy.

1053
01:45:33,389 --> 01:45:34,744
Anyway, friends?

1054
01:45:35,418 --> 01:45:36,220
Friends!

1055
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:38,926
Excuse me.

1056
01:45:40,208 --> 01:45:40,827
Hello!

1057
01:45:42,177 --> 01:45:43,261
Yes, Dr. Kidwai.

1058
01:45:44,013 --> 01:45:46,604
No, I'm much better now.
Thank you, I'm fine.

1059
01:45:46,886 --> 01:45:48,087
Yes, it's been really long.

1060
01:45:48,247 --> 01:45:49,872
I'll see you this weekend for sure.

1061
01:45:50,399 --> 01:45:51,361
- Hello Jenny!
- Hi!

1062
01:45:51,437 --> 01:45:53,714
- I haven't seen you for long.
- Been busy.

1063
01:45:56,107 --> 01:45:58,115
Dadu... how are you?

1064
01:45:58,806 --> 01:46:00,227
'Foreign language.'

1065
01:46:00,577 --> 01:46:01,063
Yeah.

1066
01:46:01,141 --> 01:46:03,857
My ankle pain still not recovered...

1067
01:46:03,935 --> 01:46:05,142
Okay, let me check.

1068
01:46:06,814 --> 01:46:09,138
Paining? Don't worry,
I'm here now.

1069
01:46:09,214 --> 01:46:10,986
I'll be coming every weekend.
Okay?

1070
01:46:11,146 --> 01:46:12,553
- Thank you.
- Don't worry.

1071
01:46:13,754 --> 01:46:14,733
And who's here?

1072
01:46:19,337 --> 01:46:20,347
Hello!

1073
01:46:21,213 --> 01:46:22,872
You're Indian, Pakistani or Malay?

1074
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:26,211
Indian!

1075
01:46:26,810 --> 01:46:27,553
Okay!

1076
01:46:27,957 --> 01:46:29,632
Hi! I'm Jenny.

1077
01:46:32,632 --> 01:46:33,942
Won't you say something?

1078
01:46:35,192 --> 01:46:36,982
He has not spoken...

1079
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:38,836
one word until now.

1080
01:46:38,991 --> 01:46:41,372
Okay! Let's see your case.

1081
01:46:47,355 --> 01:46:48,588
Muscle Spasm.

1082
01:46:50,590 --> 01:46:52,111
The recommended treatment...

1083
01:46:52,317 --> 01:46:55,360
for your case is a massage.
Let me check.

1084
01:47:03,102 --> 01:47:05,071
Your leg muscles are pretty weak.

1085
01:47:05,377 --> 01:47:07,983
It looks like you've been
in a very big accident.

1086
01:47:08,350 --> 01:47:10,458
Let me see, if you need
traction for your back.

1087
01:47:17,225 --> 01:47:18,242
May, I turn you?

1088
01:47:22,883 --> 01:47:23,936
Easy. Easy.

1089
01:47:25,871 --> 01:47:26,700
Okay.

1090
01:47:31,671 --> 01:47:34,092
Your back muscles
have deteriorated!

1091
01:47:46,205 --> 01:47:47,982
Sarfaraz Ahmad.

1092
01:47:58,055 --> 01:48:00,480
But don't worry,
you'll be fine.

1093
01:48:01,073 --> 01:48:03,624
You'll be back running around,
like you were earlier.

1094
01:48:04,868 --> 01:48:07,246
Actually you know,
I am not a doctor.

1095
01:48:07,729 --> 01:48:09,673
But, I have learnt
physiotherapy.

1096
01:48:10,637 --> 01:48:12,203
If destiny had been with me...

1097
01:48:12,934 --> 01:48:15,508
I would have had a physiotherapy
centre of my own.

1098
01:48:16,946 --> 01:48:20,304
Anyways, I'll be coming
every weekend.

1099
01:48:20,512 --> 01:48:22,408
And this is my card.

1100
01:48:22,932 --> 01:48:25,341
So call me,
if you need me earlier.

1101
01:48:25,752 --> 01:48:26,467
Take care.

1102
01:48:26,544 --> 01:48:28,199
Don't worry,
you'll be fine.

1103
01:48:39,822 --> 01:48:40,667
Bye!

1104
01:48:48,886 --> 01:48:57,553
"So much uncertainty"

1105
01:48:58,737 --> 01:49:07,319
"So much loneliness"

1106
01:49:12,657 --> 01:49:17,191
"Your stubbornness
twirls in my words"

1107
01:49:17,506 --> 01:49:21,892
"I have sunk in the perfume
of your breath"

1108
01:49:22,402 --> 01:49:26,840
"I have not been
released from love"

1109
01:49:27,314 --> 01:49:31,425
"I found the highs of heaven
in your shelter"

1110
01:49:31,764 --> 01:49:40,517
"You are the beauty of this world"

1111
01:49:41,330 --> 01:49:50,228
"You are the beauty of this world"

1112
01:50:04,952 --> 01:50:05,876
Thank you.

1113
01:50:06,141 --> 01:50:09,021
I will have your order delivered
to you by tomorrow. Okay.

1114
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:10,861
Great. Pleasure working with you.

1115
01:50:10,985 --> 01:50:12,004
With you as well.

1116
01:50:13,693 --> 01:50:15,548
Excuse me.
Can you do me a favor?

1117
01:50:15,688 --> 01:50:17,966
There are no favors
in friendship, just order.

1118
01:50:18,042 --> 01:50:20,420
I'm getting late. Will you just take
care of my shop for 5 minutes?

1119
01:50:20,497 --> 01:50:21,910
- Sure!
- I'll just go across and get some...

1120
01:50:21,986 --> 01:50:22,737
medicines for Romeo.

1121
01:50:22,813 --> 01:50:23,654
Romeo?

1122
01:50:24,299 --> 01:50:25,103
My turtle.

1123
01:50:26,726 --> 01:50:30,323
Romeo, Romeo! If only my parents
had given me such a lovely name.

1124
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:33,063
- Then, you would have crawled, too!
- I'd do what you wanted me to.

1125
01:50:36,285 --> 01:50:37,390
How stupid!

1126
01:50:44,023 --> 01:50:45,464
Come on, Oscar.

1127
01:50:45,809 --> 01:50:47,707
Let's go baby, come.

1128
01:50:59,376 --> 01:51:00,726
May I help you?

1129
01:51:03,294 --> 01:51:05,115
Are you looking out for something?

1130
01:51:10,090 --> 01:51:12,545
Night Jasmine.
It only blooms at night.

1131
01:51:12,838 --> 01:51:15,098
It's available only at
our shop in this whole area.

1132
01:51:19,888 --> 01:51:20,824
Storm?

1133
01:51:23,305 --> 01:51:24,495
Should I pack it?

1134
01:51:29,124 --> 01:51:30,262
I'll just pack it for you.

1135
01:52:01,998 --> 01:52:04,915
Oscar, wait! Oscar!

1136
01:52:17,767 --> 01:52:18,650
Oscar!

1137
01:52:19,896 --> 01:52:21,012
What are you doing?

1138
01:52:21,277 --> 01:52:22,625
Behave yourself. I am sorry.

1139
01:52:22,702 --> 01:52:24,681
Really, sorry. He normally
doesn't behave like this.

1140
01:52:24,759 --> 01:52:26,937
I don't know what happened to
him! Oscar, come on!

1141
01:52:27,164 --> 01:52:28,195
May I help you?

1142
01:52:28,802 --> 01:52:29,387
Yeah!

1143
01:52:30,997 --> 01:52:32,033
Are you okay?

1144
01:52:41,890 --> 01:52:43,047
You are?

1145
01:52:44,437 --> 01:52:47,370
Aren't you the same man,
that patient from the hospital?

1146
01:52:50,199 --> 01:52:51,398
Should I drop you somewhere?

1147
01:52:51,928 --> 01:52:56,281
"You are my winters and
I am like the sun"

1148
01:52:56,829 --> 01:53:01,215
"I find peace in your arms"

1149
01:53:01,708 --> 01:53:06,167
"Love is like a musical instrument"

1150
01:53:06,614 --> 01:53:10,531
"I found bliss in your shelter"

1151
01:53:10,863 --> 01:53:15,258
"I found you, found you!"

1152
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:19,735
"You are beauty of this world"

1153
01:53:20,545 --> 01:53:24,567
"I found you, found you!"

1154
01:53:25,408 --> 01:53:29,485
"You are beauty of this world"

1155
01:53:32,623 --> 01:53:33,711
Sit!

1156
01:53:34,458 --> 01:53:35,430
Sit!

1157
01:53:46,445 --> 01:53:47,944
You're back so soon.

1158
01:53:48,033 --> 01:53:50,862
Here, I have earned 50 ringgits
for you in 5 minutes.

1159
01:53:50,938 --> 01:53:52,353
Not bad. One second.

1160
01:53:59,785 --> 01:54:01,049
Where's Romeo?

1161
01:54:01,872 --> 01:54:05,069
Did somebody come here?
The man with the crutch?

1162
01:54:05,202 --> 01:54:06,194
Yes!

1163
01:54:06,859 --> 01:54:09,342
He was the one who
bought the night jasmine.

1164
01:54:09,506 --> 01:54:10,251
You know what?

1165
01:54:10,330 --> 01:54:12,887
I almost mistook him as
one of my favorite boxers.

1166
01:54:12,985 --> 01:54:13,677
Storm!

1167
01:54:14,235 --> 01:54:15,663
But I felt it was him.

1168
01:54:15,937 --> 01:54:18,131
But, he didn't react when
I called him by that name.

1169
01:54:18,297 --> 01:54:20,171
You know what?
I'm sure it was him.

1170
01:54:20,651 --> 01:54:23,452
I was looking at him,
but he didn't hear me at all.

1171
01:54:26,182 --> 01:54:27,208
Silly boy!

1172
01:54:43,121 --> 01:54:44,108
Suraj!

1173
01:54:56,407 --> 01:54:57,316
Suraj!

1174
01:55:22,714 --> 01:55:23,624
Suraj!

1175
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:25,533
Suraj!

1176
01:56:34,746 --> 01:56:35,763
Hello!

1177
01:56:36,346 --> 01:56:37,553
Dr. Kidwai.

1178
01:56:37,711 --> 01:56:39,025
Hi! This is Jenny.

1179
01:56:39,807 --> 01:56:42,789
Doctor, I need to know about
that patient on bed number 13.

1180
01:56:43,655 --> 01:56:45,180
Yes, Sarfaraz.

1181
01:56:46,583 --> 01:56:48,730
What happened?
What happened to Sarfaraz?

1182
01:56:51,155 --> 01:56:52,137
What?

1183
01:56:52,626 --> 01:56:54,481
He left yesterday?

1184
01:57:40,293 --> 01:57:41,246
Suraj!

1185
01:57:47,218 --> 01:57:49,853
You done so much
for me quietly.

1186
01:57:51,201 --> 01:57:52,910
Now, when it's my turn...

1187
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:57,402
you let go of my hand
and were going away.

1188
01:58:35,493 --> 01:58:37,448
It's all the fault of these eyes.

1189
01:58:39,952 --> 01:58:43,161
I could read a man
without my eyes, but...

1190
01:58:45,516 --> 01:58:50,000
I couldn't recognize him when
I could see him in front of me.

1191
01:58:55,908 --> 01:58:56,731
Why?

1192
01:58:57,749 --> 01:58:59,685
Why did you do this to me?

1193
01:59:00,998 --> 01:59:01,785
Why?

1194
01:59:02,103 --> 01:59:03,822
Because, I'm silly and ugly.

1195
01:59:19,217 --> 01:59:21,079
Jignesh is so much better than you...

1196
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,764
he never troubled his
Bindiya as much as this.
