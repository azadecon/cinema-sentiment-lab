1
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:39,666
SALAM.

2
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:56,333
Hello.

3
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,958
Hello.

4
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,958
Hello. - Hello.

5
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,208
I told you not to kill him.

6
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,333
He's still alive.

7
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:22,333
Look.

8
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:51,416
Chocolate.

9
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,125
Grade four semtex.

10
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,416
That one alone is enough to blow up this factory.

11
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,541
And he's carrying six of them.

12
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,958
If I don't speak up you will kill me.

13
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,875
And what if I do?

14
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,541
You want a medal.

15
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:19,000
Son of a witch.

16
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,666
Some money and safe passage to the border.

17
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,791
I can tell you a lot, sir.

18
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,000
There's an electrician working outside..

19
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,750
.. he is also a RAW agent.

20
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,666
Where are you taking me? - Come on.

21
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,375
Sir, why have they brought me here? - What is your name?

22
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,833
Najeeb Khan. From Liaquat Bazaar, Quetta. What's wrong, sir?

23
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,541
I've been working here for the past three months as a welder.

24
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,041
What is wrong, sir?

25
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,583
What is wrong? - Major Rajan Sinha.

26
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,000
1 Bihar Regiment.

27
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,916
Take off his shirt, and look for yourself.

28
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,750
Two bullet wounds on the left shoulder.

29
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,708
Come here.

30
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,708
He's the guy who shot Usman Gul in POK last year.

31
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,041
Come on.

32
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:04,041
Take him away.

33
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:08,750
Another RAW agent is active in this area.

34
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,000
Will you untie my hands, please?

35
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,000
Shall I strangle you?

36
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,333
Your name please?

37
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,125
One of your guards..

38
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,791
He gave me all the dope about this place.

39
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:23,208
My guard?

40
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:24,166
Who?

41
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,541
Real name is Mahendra Sandhu.

42
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,875
Cover name.. Abdul.. Abbas..

43
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,875
I don't remember.

44
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,416
Which one?

45
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:51,458
$50,000 and safe passage to the border. - Done.

46
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,041
Which one?

47
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:58,458
The fifth guy.

48
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,000
What is your name? - Ismail Yusuf Bashar.

49
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,833
Your full name.

50
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,791
Ismail Yusuf Bashar.

51
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:05,875
Take off his pants.

52
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,666
You'll find two Bullet wounds on the bum. Got it in Kargil.

53
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:14,875
What are you doing?

54
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,416
Who Mahendra Sandhu? I am Ismail Yusuf Bashar. He's lying.

55
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,125
He's lying, Colonel.

56
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:24,125
Leave me.

57
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:35,291
Lower your weapons. Down.

58
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,833
Put your magazines in this, now.

59
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,333
Now move.

60
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:44,333
Move.

61
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,666
Lock it.

62
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,833
Open it.

63
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,750
Only Rashid knew the code.

64
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,750
Take a guess.

65
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,458
Lucky guess.

66
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,416
If I survive I'll give you a slow death.

67
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,541
Every dog has his day.

68
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,541
Where is my partner?

69
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,166
What if Huzefa had killed me?

70
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,208
They'd have given you a medal.

71
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:54,208
.. and your wife a petrol pump.

72
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,000
Any last wish.

73
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes, I want to kick your behind.

74
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:51,083
Send a unit to factory no.10. Immediately.

75
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:34,666
Start the car.

76
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,375
"There's word on the streets."

77
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:00,375
"There's a guy in the city."

78
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,458
"Forget the barricades."

79
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,458
"He has sneaked in."

80
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,250
"Things that are impossible to do."

81
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,500
"He's here to make them possible."

82
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,833
"He can turn night into day."

83
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,250
"So what's his name?"

84
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,250
"What is it?"

85
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:47,166
"He's here to turn the tables on you."

86
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:55,625
Stop the car.

87
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:56,666
Let me get down.

88
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:00,666
"He's here to take on countless enemies alone."

89
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,875
"He always does his duty."

90
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,000
"As a responsibility."

91
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,125
"He can turn night into day."

92
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,458
"So what's his name?"

93
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,916
"What is it?"

94
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,916
Peshawar.

95
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:33,166
I hope you enjoyed the flight.

96
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,291
Thank you.

97
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,208
My name is Farah Feqqesh.

98
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,166
What's your name?

99
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:39,958
"Call him Govind."

100
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:44,916
"Call him Gopal. Call him anything. Call him Hari."

101
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,583
"Call him Govind."

102
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:51,458
"Call him Gopal. As long as he's there, nothing to worry."

103
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,000
"Call him Govind."

104
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,125
"Call him Gopal. Call him anything. Call him Hari."

105
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,541
"Call him Govind."

106
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:03,541
"Call him Gopal. As long as he's there, nothing to worry."

107
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,625
"Call him Govind."

108
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:37,583
"Call him Gopal. Call him anything. Call him Hari."

109
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,041
"Call him Govind."

110
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:44,208
"Call him Gopal. As long as he's there, nothing to worry."

111
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:45,750
"Call him Govind."

112
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,541
"Call him Gopal. Call him anything. Call him Hari."

113
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,333
"Call him Govind."

114
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:57,250
"Call him Gopal. As long as he's there, nothing to worry."

115
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,875
"Call him Govind."

116
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:03,833
"Call him Gopal. Call him anything. Call him Hari."

117
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,583
"Call him Govind."

118
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:09,583
"Call him Gopal. As long as he's there, nothing to worry."

119
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,500
Not... Not..

120
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,791
Arms dealer found dead in a graveyard outside Moscow.

121
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:38,083
Early this morning.

122
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,833
The murder of Russian arms dealer Andre Sukhorov..

123
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,666
.. has again thrown up this dangerous question.

124
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,583
Did Sukhorov possess a suitcase nuclear bomb?

125
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,375
And if so, where is it?

126
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,500
Both the United States and Soviet Union..

127
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,625
.. have acknowledged producing nuclear weapons..

128
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,625
.. small enough to be carried in specially designed backpacks..

129
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,583
.. during the cold-war.

130
00:16:59,083 --> 00:16:59,750
These bombs, identified in Russia as KV series..

131
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,375
.. have the explosive power between..

132
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:02,833
.. Three and Ten kiloton of TNT.

133
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,083
The bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki..

134
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,375
.. were 20-30 kiloton each.

135
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,083
But the value of the suitcase bomb lies..

136
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,208
.. in its ability to be easily smuggled across borders..

137
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:14,833
.. transported by means widely available.

138
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:20,041
And placed as close to the target as possible.

139
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,875
A single suitcase bomb can devastate..

140
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,125
.. three kilometers of a modern city.

141
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,458
It will kill everything within a ten kilometer radius..

142
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,791
.. and the radiation will subsequently kill more.

143
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,083
Gentlemen Sukhorov is dead

144
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,125
I've heard the bomb is up for sale

145
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,333
This is what every terror group in the world is looking for.

146
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,416
This could start World War 3.

147
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:50,708
If this gets into the wrong hands, millions will be killed.

148
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:54,708
I was thinking billions.

149
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,166
Comrades!

150
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,208
It's my friend Dmitri's birthday.

151
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,583
So we all have a drink, okay.

152
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:20,583
Make drink.

153
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,208
You wanted to meet in a public place.

154
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,458
Abu Nazir has turned a public place, private.

155
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,291
I am impressed.

156
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:13,291
I've chosen the right man.

157
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:31,125
I need $50 million cash in three days, in Morocco.

158
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:35,333
So much in so little time.

159
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:36,833
Do you know my commission?

160
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,833
Do you know what I need it for?

161
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,583
India?

162
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,583
I need the money in three days in Morocco.

163
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:58,541
Do you have a contact who can be trusted?

164
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,541
I know the right man for the job.

165
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,791
I will give you $50 million cash, tomorrow.

166
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,791
All he has to do is buy 242.

167
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,166
242?

168
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,958
Abu, before talking about 242..

169
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:32,083
.. can you tell me how many calories there are in one potato chip?

170
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,833
20.

171
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:39,333
And how many chips did you eat just now?

172
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,291
I am sorry, I am a health freak.

173
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:45,291
And this can be.. dangerous for your health.

174
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,458
Comrades.

175
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,666
Come. We take drink.

176
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:06,666
Bring champagne.

177
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:15,333
This is Colonel.

178
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,041
My partner and friend. - Hi.

179
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,041
Five man army. - Yes.

180
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,208
When I was a child..

181
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,000
.. I watched a movie called 'The Five Man Army'.

182
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,000
Your boss Abu, reminds me of Bud Spencer.

183
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,166
Japanese. You'll slap me if I tell you the meaning.

184
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:10,166
What do you mean?

00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:58,333
I am a RAW agent.

371
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,916
I killed Abu.

372
00:38:01,416 --> 00:38:04,708
"Ra Ra Rasputin, lover of the Russian queen."

373
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:07,958
"It was a shame how he carried on."

374
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:11,958
"Ra Ra Rasputin,..

375
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:37,333
Did you get the money?

376
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:39,541
Forget the money.

377
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:43,333
Do you know what you said?

378
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:46,333
What did I say? - You killed Abu.

379
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:49,208
You are a RAW agent.

380
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:50,500
Did I say that?

381
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,375
How much Pentothal did you give me, madam?

382
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:55,000
50 ml. - Thanks.

383
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,875
Yes I killed Abu..

384
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:58,833
.. because he had a RAW agent working under his nose.

385
00:38:59,333 --> 00:38:59,916
His bodyguard.

386
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:01,083
Mahim Murtaza.

387
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,541
Real name Rajan Sinha.

388
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,250
Who do you work for?

389
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,541
Who do you work for?

390
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:11,458
You know we're not supposed to take names, right?

391
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:13,500
Abu slipped up.

392
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,291
And I was sent here to check if..

393
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:20,541
.. David Kazan too is slipping up.

394
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:24,666
But look what you did to me?

395
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:26,208
Bravo, Mr. Kazan.

396
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:28,791
Can I get a towel, please?

397
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:30,166
I got the money but..

398
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:32,208
.. there's something fishy about this Freddie

399
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:36,583
Shall I kill him?

400
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:41,166
Why don't you stay the night?

401
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:45,666
What is on your mind, Mr. Kazan?

402
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:48,416
Who is that doctor?

403
00:39:48,916 --> 00:39:50,416
Ruby Mendes.

404
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:51,791
My personal doctor.

405
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:54,708
Ruby Mendes. Nice name.

406
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:56,958
Did you give her that name? - Meaning?

407
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:58,375
Bathroom. - What?

408
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:02,166
Bathroom?

409
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:06,166
Thank you.

410
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:10,000
I am so sorry, madam.

411
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
Excuse me.

412
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,833
You should have told me someone's inside.

413
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:16,708
Who is it? - I don't know.

414
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:17,791
Some lady.

415
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:21,791
She's sitting on the commode, reading a magazine.

416
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,916
There is no one here.

417
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:39,625
What?

418
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:43,625
She was right here..

419
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:47,375
Where did she disappear?

420
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:49,125
She was reading that magazine.

421
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:52,541
She was wearing a blue kaftan. Big necklace around the neck..

422
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:55,000
.. and a strange tattoo here.

423
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,000
She was right here.

424
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:05,500
It was her.

425
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,250
My mother.

426
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,333
She passed away 22 years ago.

427
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:13,458
What?

428
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:17,458
What the hell did you inject me with?

429
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:26,416
You need rest, Mr. Freddie.

430
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:29,375
Rest.

431
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:30,500
Show him to his room.

432
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,500
Goodnight, Mr. Kazan. - Goodnight.

433
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:45,125
Hello, Dr. Ruby.

434
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,958
If you're feeling dizzy then take these pills..

435
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:53,875
And eat something.

436
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:55,583
I had two bottles of water.

437
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:57,833
Yet everything looks 3D.

438
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:02,416
Drink? - No, thanks.

439
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:06,125
Kazan told me that you saw his mother.

440
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,083
I think I saw a ghost.

441
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:11,791
Do you believe in ghosts?

442
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:13,875
What nonsense.

443
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:15,666
39 dead.

444
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:17,750
Don't they haunt you?

445
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,750
The ghosts of those who died in the London blast.

446
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:26,916
I am impressed.

447
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:28,750
You escaped from a British jail.

448
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:31,125
.. have been evading Interpol.

449
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:33,000
I am impressed..

450
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,666
Miss Iram Parveen Bilal.

451
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:40,375
Iram Parveen Bilal is dead.

452
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:43,875
My name is Ruby.

453
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:47,875
Goodnight, Freddie.

454
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:15,625
Does he know about the spycam?

455
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:19,625
He knows about me.

456
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:25,375
Yes.

457
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:29,625
A tourist group has just landed from London.

458
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,500
There's an Ml6 agent amongst them.

459
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,500
Maybe he knows about 242.

460
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:50,166
I am going out for a walk.

461
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:51,708
If you want to keep an eye on me..

462
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:54,000
.. then send Dr. Ruby along..

463
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,000
Here.

464
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:18,458
I don't think you exploded that bomb..

465
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:22,458
Why do you say that?

466
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:27,208
You have killer eyes..

467
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:33,291
But they're not the eyes of a killer.

468
00:45:33,791 --> 00:45:37,291
Tell that to my London court judge.

469
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:46,375
You know everything about me.

470
00:45:46,875 --> 00:45:48,375
Tell me something about yourself.

471
00:45:48,875 --> 00:45:49,708
I cannot lie.

472
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:51,625
And you'll catch me if I tell the truth.

473
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,875
I am in the same business as you.

474
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:55,250
But why are we talking shop

475
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,291
.. in a romantic place like Tangier?

476
00:45:57,791 --> 00:45:59,291
If you weren't so serious..

477
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:01,833
.. I would've invited you to dinner this evening.

478
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:03,125
And cooked for you too.

479
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:06,000
I am a good cook.

480
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,000
What's on the menu?

481
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,833
Wow. That means yes.

482
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:13,083
Well, that's a Kodak moment.

483
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:17,250
May I take a picture, madam?

484
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:18,416
Excuse me?

485
00:46:18,916 --> 00:46:19,458
Excuse me? - Yes?

486
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:20,541
Do you speak English? - Yes.. yes.

487
00:46:21,041 --> 00:46:22,333
Can you take a photo of me and my wife, please?

488
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:25,041
Okay. - How is Freddie? - very happy

489
00:46:25,541 --> 00:46:26,750

00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,041
He's the Ml6 agent in-charge of the Middle East sector.

491
00:46:29,541 --> 00:46:30,333
Something's happening.

492
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:32,583
Where can I find him? - Hotel Rif Spa.

493
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:34,833
Room no. 430. I am sending you a photo.

494

Understood. Understood.

495
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:37,333
Photo?

496
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:38,416
Not good here.

497
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:42,458
Fountain. - Okay. - Madam, fountain please.

498
00:46:42,958 --> 00:46:44,708
Ready.

499
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:47,000
Smile.

500
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,875
Thank you. - Enjoy your honeymoon.

501
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:51,666
Shall we?

502
00:46:52,166 --> 00:46:53,833
Have lunch.

503
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:55,916

"Praise the Lord for creating one such as you"

508
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,958
How many girls have you said this to?

509
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:30,958
Including you? 242.

510
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:38,541
You've brought $ 50 million to buy 242.

511
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:41,333
Do you know what 242 is?

512
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:43,125
What did Kazan tell you?

513
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:44,625
Excuse me, madam.

514
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:46,666
The menu.

515
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:50,666
Thank you.

516
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:28,833
Excuse me.

517
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:53,416
I am not feeling well.

518
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:54,833
I have to go back.

519
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:58,833
Of course, no problem.

520
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,000
I hope you will come with me to the auction this evening.

521
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:15,791

I am going to match the sums that have been raised here today..

.. in this lovely, this great country. - Good evening, Sir.

528
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:47,708

Good luck.

I should be keeping a watch on you instead.

537
00:51:16,791 --> 00:51:20,000
This is the beginning. - Found this in Richard's room.

538
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,958
You must have dropped it in a hurry.

539
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:25,833
No, I didn't. When did you flick this?

540
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,083
And who is Richard?

541
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:30,083

Thank you.

589
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:08,000
For activation, in those days

590
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,541
.. the command validation of a Russian satellite was required

591
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:12,791
But we have made changes.

592
00:56:13,291 --> 00:56:14,833
You need to enter a password that's all..

593
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:16,583
.. that is required for activation.

594
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:21,708
This Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam is the detonator.

595
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:25,708
Don't lose it.

596
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:58,458
So, my congratulations, Mr. Kazan. - Thank you.

597
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:02,458
And thank you, Dr. Rana, for your contributions. - Thank you.

598
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,500

Cheers. - Cheers.

600
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,666
Dr. Rana, this is the best champagne in the world.

601
00:57:28,166 --> 00:57:31,666
And you are drinking water.

602
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:45,041
His job was done.

603
00:57:45,541 --> 00:57:49,041
Can you take care of him?

604
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,041
Freddie Khambatta.

605
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:08,083
I am Colonel.

606
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:09,958
Why are you standing here?

607
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:12,416
Join the party.

608
00:58:12,916 --> 00:58:14,000
Party's over, Colonel.

609
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:18,000
The party's just begun.

610
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:23,208
If you see my mother again..

611
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,333
.. then tell her I said Hi.

612
00:58:25,833 --> 00:58:31,625
Whoever he is, get rid of him.

613
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:35,625
Hello, my dear.

614
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:47,958
The pipeline goes through this lane..

615
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:51,250
.. and we have an observation post every 10 kilometers.

616
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:55,333
Sir, there's a call for you.

617
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:58,625
Hello.

618
00:58:59,125 --> 00:59:01,750
Hello, Mr. Nawaz.

619
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:04,625
Hello, Mr. lftekhaar.

620
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:07,500
I can hear raging fire and roaring rain.

621
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:08,750
You are in Chaman.

622
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,375
Impressive, Mr. Nawaz.

623
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:12,208
Even at this age, you still have keen ears.

624
00:59:12,708 --> 00:59:14,791
I can even hear what's happening in Morocco.

625
00:59:15,291 --> 00:59:18,208
I just heard that David Kazan has bought a nuclear bomb.

626
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:22,000
What? Where did you get this news from?

627
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,791
Mr. Nawaz, you will have to share your source with me.

628
00:59:25,291 --> 00:59:26,666
Because if there's any truth in this..

629
00:59:27,166 --> 00:59:27,666
.. then we'll need to cooperate.

630
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:29,291
Tell me, General.

631
00:59:29,791 --> 00:59:30,291
Are you involved?

632
00:59:30,791 --> 00:59:31,708
I have no idea.

633
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:33,083
I didn't know at all.

634
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:34,416
If I had any clue about this..

635
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:35,958
.. then I would have called you myself.

636
00:59:36,458 --> 00:59:38,791
Look, Mr. lftekhaar, whatever the problems between us..

637
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:40,041
.. this cannot be the solution.

638
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:41,583
Thank you very much.

639
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:44,250
Give me 12 hours. I will call you back.

640
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:48,250
Goodbye.

641
00:59:58,541 --> 00:59:59,208
Cancel the inspection.

642
00:59:59,708 --> 01:00:01,166
We will return to Islamabad right now.

643
01:00:01,666 --> 01:00:02,791
Cancel my trip to China.

644
01:00:03,291 --> 01:00:04,000
And call an emergency meeting..

645
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,041
.. of all the section chiefs tomorrow.

646
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:06,333
Specially section Q, okay.

647
01:00:06,833 --> 01:00:10,333
Fine.

648
01:00:19,291 --> 01:00:22,416
Take lftekhaar sir's convoy to the Turkhum border..

649
01:00:22,916 --> 01:00:26,416
.. and blow it up with a launcher.

650
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,916
I'll keep you posted, sir.

651
01:02:08,416 --> 01:02:09,291
Breaking news.

652
01:02:09,791 --> 01:02:13,291
ISI chief lftekhaar Ahmed killed in a bomb blast.

653
01:02:37,916 --> 01:02:38,708
Is this Zaheer's home?

654
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:41,666
This is Zaheer's home, but he is on the terrace.

655
01:02:42,166 --> 01:02:45,666
Thank You! - You're welcome

656
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,875
Who are you? - I am Freddie.

657
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:21,125
Freddie Khambatta. - What?

658
01:03:21,625 --> 01:03:22,250
Yes. I am Freddie.

659
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:26,250
If you are Freddie then who is he?

660
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:31,500
So you were telling the truth that day.

661
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:32,708
You are a RAW agent!

662
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:34,291
Who is the Colonel?

663
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:37,000
Where is the bomb? - That's what I came here to find out.

664
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,583
I thought you knew about him.

665
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:41,791
She's trying to confuse us.

666
01:03:42,291 --> 01:03:43,375
Where is the bomb?

667
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:46,958
I am on your side.

668
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:50,416
I work for the British Intelligence.

669
01:03:50,916 --> 01:03:51,666
And you killed that British agent?

670
01:03:52,166 --> 01:03:53,208
I didn't kill Richard.

671
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:55,458
He was my handler.

672
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:57,708
I went there to inform him about you.

673
01:03:58,208 --> 01:04:00,458
To show him your face.

674
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:03,583
You killed 40 people in London.

675
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:05,833
You were smiling as you got out of the car.

676
01:04:06,333 --> 01:04:09,833
You were smiling.

677
01:04:10,958 --> 01:04:16,875
I was smiling, because I was happy.

678
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:18,166
It was a beautiful day.

679
01:04:18,666 --> 01:04:21,791
Boss, why are you listening to this nonsense?

680
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:26,166
I am responsible for the death of those 40 people.

681
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:29,041
Because my own friends..

682
01:04:29,541 --> 01:04:33,666
.. had planted the bomb in my car.

683
01:04:34,166 --> 01:04:38,416
I was waiting for them.

684
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:40,916
If I wasn't feeling hungry..

685
01:04:41,416 --> 01:04:44,958
.. and hadn't stepped out..

686
01:04:45,458 --> 01:04:48,958
.. then the blast would have killed me..

687
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:55,500
When one of the group was caught in Pakistan..

688
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,291
.. then ISI chief lftekhaar Ahmed came to see me.

689
01:04:59,791 --> 01:05:02,000
He was convinced that I am innocent.

690
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,625
He convinced Richard.

691
01:05:04,125 --> 01:05:06,125
They said that they will help me..

692
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:08,416
.. but I will have to work for them.

693
01:05:08,916 --> 01:05:10,333
They sprung me out of jail..

694
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:14,250
.. and sent me to Morocco, to Kazan.

695
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:19,000
Kazan buys drugs from terrorists, and supplies arms.

696
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,666
So you are an ISI agent?

697
01:05:21,166 --> 01:05:22,791
I just report to lftekhaar Sir.

698
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:24,583
He knows the truth about me.

699
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:27,625
Last month I intercepted Abu Nazir's phone call from Moscow..

700
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:31,041
.. that Freddie Khambatta is arriving with $50 million.

701
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:33,666
I informed Richard, that's why he came here personally.

702
01:05:34,166 --> 01:05:35,666
Can you prove this?

703
01:05:36,166 --> 01:05:37,583
Talk to lftekhaar sir.

704
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:39,000
He knows me.

705
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:43,000
lftekhaar Ahmed is dead.

706
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:46,625
He's dead?

707
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:48,958
And Richard too.

708
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:52,541
Now there's no one left to prove your story. And you..

709
01:05:53,041 --> 01:05:56,541
Zahir.

710
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,375
He's one of them.

711
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:07,333
Now he knows about you.

712
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:11,333
Shoot him.

713
01:06:16,041 --> 01:06:17,583
No.

714
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:19,750
I cannot kill anyone.

715
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:22,291
Not even him.

716
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:24,500
I don't know where the bomb is.

717
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,791
But the Rubaiyat is the trigger.

718
01:06:27,291 --> 01:06:29,000
The bomb is useless without Rubaiyat.

719
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,500
And right now Rubaiyat is in Kazan's safe.

720
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,416
If you believe me then let me go.

721
01:06:33,916 --> 01:06:34,833
I know the combination of that safe.

722
01:06:35,333 --> 01:06:35,916
Otherwise go yourself.

723
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:39,916
But for God's sake get that Rubaiyat out of there.

724
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:43,166
Let's go.

725
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:47,166
Come on.

726
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:00,541
20 minutes.

727
01:07:01,041 --> 01:07:04,541
Good luck, Iram.

728
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,333
She was lying.

729
01:07:19,833 --> 01:07:20,875
You believed her?

730
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:24,875
She was telling the truth.

731
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:04,416
I have the Rubaiyat and the location of the bomb as well.

732
01:08:04,916 --> 01:08:08,416
Meet me at Golden Farah restaurant, in 20 minutes.

733
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:51,458
Get lost.

734
01:09:05,833 --> 01:09:09,583
"My friends deserted me."

735
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:14,416
"My love deserted me."

736
01:09:14,916 --> 01:09:18,208
"Life's so.."

737
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:19,708
Indian?

738
01:09:20,208 --> 01:09:23,708
Oh, good. Number one.

739
01:10:50,166 --> 01:10:53,666
Goodbye to Morocco.

740
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:24,583
Indian? - Yes.

741
01:11:25,083 --> 01:11:25,541
I am Suresh Krishna.

742
01:11:26,041 --> 01:11:29,333
That's funny.. - My name is also Suresh Krishna.

743
01:11:29,833 --> 01:11:31,333
By the way, I work for the United Nations.

744
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:34,791
Deputy Health Commissioner for Africa.

745
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,083
Is this a joke?

746
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:40,083
I am the Deputy Health Commissioner for Africa.

747
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,750
We need to ask you some questions, Mr. Shastri.

748
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:21,416
How are you feeling?

749
01:12:21,916 --> 01:12:25,416
I am hungry.

750
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:39,416
We found Mr. Kazan's address in your pocket.

751
01:12:39,916 --> 01:12:41,958
He's dead. His house has been burgled.

752
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:44,625
How do you know him? - I mean him in an auction.

753
01:12:45,125 --> 01:12:48,625
Don't disturb the patient please.

754
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:54,000
I need to examine the patient Officers.

755
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:58,000
I will see you in some time.

756
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:04,500
Good morning. - Good morning, Doctor.

757
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,041
Three bullets and you're still alive.

758
01:13:07,541 --> 01:13:10,083
You must be really lucky.

759
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:12,333
Do you believe in luck?

760
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:17,708
If I believed in luck I'd be dead a long time ago, Doctor.

761
01:13:18,208 --> 01:13:21,708
I see.

762
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:30,541
Do you believe in luck, doctor?

763
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:41,250
Where is she?

764
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,000
Where is she?

765
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:44,708
Where is she? - Riga.

766
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:48,708
Riga.

767
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:03,250
Do you know where they are?

768
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:40,750
Look at that man closely.

769
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:53,708
Anton Brega.

770
01:14:54,208 --> 01:14:56,041
Considers himself a Casanova.

771
01:14:56,541 --> 01:14:58,541
He is an alcoholic.. and a womanizer

772
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:00,625
He has one more bad habit.

773
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:02,791
He's honest.

774
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:04,833
He's the Airport Security chief.

775
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:08,833
There's a pass card in his wallet which I want.

776
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:11,250
We'll be done by 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

777
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:14,208
Until then you will have to keep him out of the airport.

778
01:15:14,708 --> 01:15:20,958
So.. you have to spend the night with him.

779
01:15:21,458 --> 01:15:23,416
Get lost! I am not your property!

780
01:15:23,916 --> 01:15:27,416
Bloody reptile!

781
01:15:29,375 --> 01:15:30,375
I just want to die.

782
01:15:30,875 --> 01:15:34,375
No, actually, I just want to get drunk.

783
01:15:39,166 --> 01:15:41,250
Sorry. - No, that's okay. That's fine.

784
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:42,791
Give me another one.

785
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:44,583
What do you want? Just get lost.

786
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:47,833
Okay. Sir, please.

787
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:51,833
Thank you.

788
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:56,583
Anton Brega. - Josie.

789
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:13,833
I told you to get lost.

790
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:16,000
We just got out of the third casino.

791
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,958
He has won around three-four lakhs.

792
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:20,250
He says I am lucky for him.

793
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,208
Now he wants to take me home.

794
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:23,333
Two more hours.

795
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:24,625
Our job will be done.

796
01:17:25,125 --> 01:17:27,083
Take him to Hotel Riga. 405.

797
01:17:27,583 --> 01:17:28,458
There's a room booked in the name of Josie.

798
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:32,208
Yeah, 405. - Darling, I've got some special champagne for you.

799
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:36,208
That's for you. Look at it.

800
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:48,083
Goodbye.

801
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:00,458
Hello, sir.

802
01:18:00,958 --> 01:18:03,000
Welcome to Riga. Mr. Nawaz called from Delhi.

803
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:07,000
This packet is for you.

804
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:13,041
Any news about those two?

805
01:18:13,541 --> 01:18:15,583
"My darling, I said."

806
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:18,208
"My darling, you heard it."

807
01:18:18,708 --> 01:18:22,208
"Our hearts communicated with each other."

808
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:48,083
"My darling, I said."

809
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:50,875
"My darling, you heard it."

810
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:54,875
"My darling, I said."

811
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,750
Hello.

812
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:04,750
Excuse me.

813
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:09,375
Yes.

814
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:11,291
That Brega is after me.

815
01:19:11,791 --> 01:19:12,791
He's about to jump on me.

816
01:19:13,291 --> 01:19:14,083
Relax.

817
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:15,625
Open the mini bar.

818
01:19:16,125 --> 01:19:17,166
There's a chocolate box inside.

819
01:19:17,666 --> 01:19:18,583
Feed him some of those chocolates.

820
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:20,125
He'll pass out for a few hours.

821
01:19:20,625 --> 01:19:22,458
What about the package? - You want to see it?

822
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:24,541
Knock him out and leave right away.

823
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:28,541
Okay, fine.

824
01:19:31,625 --> 01:19:34,416
I was waiting for you at Golden Farah.

825
01:19:34,916 --> 01:19:35,458
Thank God you are alive.

826
01:19:35,958 --> 01:19:38,625
Enough of your charade. - Listen to me.

827
01:19:39,125 --> 01:19:42,750
Colonel had asked me to - Where is the Colonel?

828
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:44,625
I was just talking to him.

829
01:19:45,125 --> 01:19:46,916
The bomb is here.. in the city.

830
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:50,916
The man in the room with me is..

831
01:20:16,416 --> 01:20:19,916
You saved my life.

832
01:20:43,791 --> 01:20:47,291
Time for a little chat, Colonel.

833
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,708
You okay? - Get me out of here.

834
01:21:06,208 --> 01:21:09,541
Get here, now.

835
01:21:10,041 --> 01:21:13,541
Get down.

836
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:30,416
Ready?

837
01:22:05,041 --> 01:22:06,041
Catch them.

838
01:22:06,541 --> 01:22:07,916
He's heading straight.

839
01:22:08,416 --> 01:22:11,916
He's taking a turn.

840
01:22:13,875 --> 01:22:14,875
He's near town square.

841
01:22:15,375 --> 01:22:19,583
Straight and left.

842
01:22:20,083 --> 01:22:23,625
20 kilometers from here.

843
01:22:24,125 --> 01:22:27,625
He has stopped near Maxima Mall.

844
01:22:45,583 --> 01:22:47,625
Don't you want to know why I lied to you in Morocco

845
01:22:48,125 --> 01:22:51,625
Maybe you didn't like my shoes?

846
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:02,500
'The Colonel had killed Kazan.'

847
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,875
'He was about to kill me.. '

848
01:23:05,375 --> 01:23:07,500
'And suddenly I saw.. '

849
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:08,583
'In another minute..'

850
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:10,541
'..Freddie Khambatta would've told him everything'

851
01:23:11,041 --> 01:23:13,250
'The man you think is Freddie Khambatta is actually a RAW agent.'

852
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:15,041
'I thought that if I told the Colonel about you..

853
01:23:15,541 --> 01:23:17,458
..I might gain his trust.' - 'Where is he? '

854
01:23:17,958 --> 01:23:20,000
'Maybe he would involve me in whatever his plan was..

855
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:24,708
I did it to find out about the bomb.

856
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:26,458
'Sir, I am.. '

857
01:23:26,958 --> 01:23:28,458
'Just a minute. Just a minute.'

858
01:23:28,958 --> 01:23:30,958
'Sir, I am Freddie Khambatta.'

859
01:23:31,458 --> 01:23:32,208
'I am a flight purser.'

860
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:33,625
'Abu gave me a $10 note. What was his name? '

861
01:23:34,125 --> 01:23:36,041
'I don't know his name. He beat me.'

862
01:23:36,541 --> 01:23:40,291
'He took the dollar I was supposed to give you.'

863
01:23:40,791 --> 01:23:42,833
Colonel had taken my phone away.

864
01:23:43,333 --> 01:23:45,083
I snatched someone's phone from the airport toilet

865
01:23:45,583 --> 01:23:49,083
.. and tried calling you.

866
01:26:32,583 --> 01:26:36,083
How will you face three armed men with one bullet?

867
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:43,583
Don't be afraid.

868
01:26:44,083 --> 01:26:47,583
May God give your husband a long life.

869
01:27:32,541 --> 01:27:36,041
It's stopped.

870
01:27:59,041 --> 01:28:02,541
Come here.

871
01:28:04,833 --> 01:28:05,916
Where did you get this? - What is that?

872
01:28:06,416 --> 01:28:07,208
Where did you get this? - I don't know. What is that?

873
01:28:07,708 --> 01:28:09,125
Where did you get this? - I don't know.

874
01:28:09,625 --> 01:28:13,125
This tracker. - I am telling you, I don't know.

875
01:28:55,666 --> 01:28:56,500
Dr. Suresh Krishna.

876
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,291
Dr. Suresh Krishna?

877
01:28:59,791 --> 01:29:00,416
We are waiting for you

878
01:29:00,916 --> 01:29:04,416
Sorry, sir. This is portable X-ray machine no. 311.

879
01:29:24,666 --> 01:29:27,583
Maybe the colonel lied to you.

880
01:29:28,083 --> 01:29:31,750
Brega's pass was used not to bring bomb into the city

881
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:35,750
.. but to take it out of the city.

882
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:44,708
13 flights have taken off..

883
01:29:45,208 --> 01:29:46,666
..since Brega's death..

884
01:29:47,166 --> 01:29:50,750
.. they can be checked only on landing.

885
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:52,916
The local police want to question you.

886
01:29:53,416 --> 01:29:56,291
Cops in Moscow and Morocco police want to question me as well.

887
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:58,125
You are in a queue.

888
01:29:58,625 --> 01:30:02,208
Keys please.

889
01:30:02,708 --> 01:30:06,208
I'll be in touch, sir.

890
01:30:12,875 --> 01:30:14,166
Who are you? - Mr. Khana.

891
01:30:14,666 --> 01:30:18,166
Where are they?

892
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,958
They say you need too eat to gain something.

893
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:32,458
Whenever you get the opportunity, recharge.

894
01:30:32,958 --> 01:30:36,458
Sit down, eat something.

895
01:30:38,291 --> 01:30:39,291
What's on your mind?

896
01:30:39,791 --> 01:30:41,041
Wondering what happens next?

897
01:30:41,541 --> 01:30:44,333
Don't worry, we'll help you.

898
01:30:44,833 --> 01:30:47,458
You cannot help me.

899
01:30:47,958 --> 01:30:50,583
New identity, passport, character certificate.

900
01:30:51,083 --> 01:30:51,791
Money.

901
01:30:52,291 --> 01:30:53,375
What do you want?

902
01:30:53,875 --> 01:30:55,875
What do I want?

903
01:30:56,375 --> 01:30:58,875
I want my life back.

904
01:30:59,375 --> 01:31:03,416
I want my father, who died when I was in jail.

905
01:31:03,916 --> 01:31:06,208
I want the clinic, with a board outside saying..

906
01:31:06,708 --> 01:31:08,750
.. Doctor Iram Parveen Bilal.

907
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:09,958
I want a home.

908
01:31:10,458 --> 01:31:12,708
A husband who's crazy about me.

909
01:31:13,208 --> 01:31:14,041
I want kids.

910
01:31:14,541 --> 01:31:16,000
I want a normal life.

911
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,666
I want a world..

912
01:31:19,166 --> 01:31:23,458
..where the Rubaiyat is just a book with beautiful poetry.

913
01:31:23,958 --> 01:31:27,458
Not a nuclear bomb detonator.

914
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:40,166
There's a circuit inside that activates the bomb.

915
01:31:40,666 --> 01:31:42,666
I have some more information.

916
01:31:43,166 --> 01:31:44,833
Take that as well.

917
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:48,541
I overheard the Colonel on the phone last night.

918
01:31:49,041 --> 01:31:51,250
He was fixing a meeting with Taimoor Pasha on the 28th.

919
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:52,458
At Hotel Gazebo.

920
01:31:52,958 --> 01:31:55,208
Hotel Gazebo is in Karachi.

921
01:31:55,708 --> 01:31:57,166
I don't know anything else.

922
01:31:57,666 --> 01:32:01,166
And I don't want to either.

923
01:32:03,458 --> 01:32:05,625
Can I go now?

924
01:32:06,125 --> 01:32:09,625
Where will you go?

925
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:18,250
Anywhere.

926
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:30,000
I wanted to be a painter.

927
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,000
I thought I will be famous.

928
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:33,083
A house in the mountains.

929
01:32:33,583 --> 01:32:35,041
Exhibitions in Paris.

930
01:32:35,541 --> 01:32:36,916
Five marriages.

931
01:32:37,416 --> 01:32:40,833
Couple of kids from each marriage..

932
01:32:41,333 --> 01:32:43,291
But the cable snapped. - What?

933
01:32:43,791 --> 01:32:45,583
One of the cables of the ropeway snapped.

934
01:32:46,083 --> 01:32:48,250
We were in Mussoorie, on a school trip.

935
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:51,666
The entire cabin was dangling on one cable.

936
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:54,208
A sheer 2000 feet deep drop below.

937
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:56,750
The other cable could snap any moment..

938
01:32:57,250 --> 01:33:02,208
Plunging us to our death. And then I climbed up.

939
01:33:02,708 --> 01:33:05,291
I clung to a rope for eight minutes.

940
01:33:05,791 --> 01:33:07,250
And managed to secure the cable.

941
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:11,250
I was 15 years old.

942
01:33:13,583 --> 01:33:17,125
I got a medal from President Venkatraman.

943
01:33:17,625 --> 01:33:20,625
Those eight minutes changed my life.

944
01:33:21,125 --> 01:33:22,958
I always wanted to return..

945
01:33:23,458 --> 01:33:26,958
.. to that place between life and death.

946
01:33:30,541 --> 01:33:33,166
I am still hanging from that cable.

947
01:33:33,666 --> 01:33:37,166
The day I let go..

948
01:33:47,041 --> 01:33:50,500
In Delhi, when the dogs from one lane start barking..

949
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,500
.. do you know what the other dogs do?

950
01:34:26,208 --> 01:34:27,958
Good evening, sir.

951
01:34:28,458 --> 01:34:29,916
Sir, we've to leave for the airport in an hour.

952
01:34:30,416 --> 01:34:30,875
You're leaving for London.

953
01:34:31,375 --> 01:34:32,083
They are waiting for you at the Embassy.

954
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:36,041
I've got all the documents with me.

955
01:34:36,541 --> 01:34:40,041
Passports. Documents and some money, sir.

956
01:34:45,041 --> 01:34:46,458
Excuse me.

957
01:34:46,958 --> 01:34:50,458
Can I clear the table?

958
01:35:15,125 --> 01:35:18,625
Five minutes, Iram.

959
01:35:23,166 --> 01:35:26,500
I've a flight to catch. Kill them.

960
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,541
Sir, I will wait in the lobby. - Okay.

961
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:34,541
Rajesh.

962
01:35:35,666 --> 01:35:38,250
Sir.

963
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:39,875
Where is it?

964
01:35:40,375 --> 01:35:43,208
Sir.

965
01:35:43,708 --> 01:35:47,208
Where is it?

966
01:35:52,416 --> 01:35:54,083
I had no option.

967
01:35:54,583 --> 01:35:58,083
How many people outside?

968
01:36:24,291 --> 01:36:28,125
"My life was engulfed in darkness until you came with a ray of hope"

969
01:36:28,625 --> 01:36:32,208
"Giving a meaning to my otherwise futile life"

970
01:36:32,708 --> 01:36:34,333
"I was like a lost ship"

971
01:36:34,833 --> 01:36:38,416
"and I wonder how you brought me to the shore"

972
01:36:38,916 --> 01:36:40,416
"we have a connection"

973
01:36:40,916 --> 01:36:44,458
"Show me a way out"

974
01:36:44,958 --> 01:36:48,500
"Show me a way out"

975
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,958
"Who know how do we get out"

976
01:36:53,458 --> 01:36:57,083
"Show me a way out"

977
01:36:57,583 --> 01:36:59,333
"what else is there to say"

978
01:36:59,833 --> 01:37:01,333
"I want to live"

979
01:37:01,833 --> 01:37:05,416
"I choose your embrace over heaven"

980
01:37:05,916 --> 01:37:09,666
"You entered my life like a beautiful dawn."

981
01:37:10,166 --> 01:37:13,666
"Giving me a reason to live."

982
01:37:39,416 --> 01:37:47,375
"was generous enough"

983
01:37:47,875 --> 01:37:54,208
"Did me a favor on the way out"

984
01:37:54,708 --> 01:38:02,375
"to bless me with your sight which was like a guiding star"

985
01:38:02,875 --> 01:38:11,625
"like a hint from destiny"

986
01:38:12,125 --> 01:38:16,083
"you pacified my estranged feelings"

987
01:38:16,583 --> 01:38:20,000
"breaking the silence with a debate"

988
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:24,125
"I was like a lost ship"

989
01:38:24,625 --> 01:38:27,666
"and I wonder how you brought me to the shore"

990
01:38:28,166 --> 01:38:32,625
"we have a connection"

991
01:38:33,125 --> 01:38:36,541
"I fail to understand how"

992
01:38:37,041 --> 01:38:40,458
"but we do"

993
01:38:40,958 --> 01:38:44,875
"Show me a way out"

994
01:38:45,375 --> 01:38:49,041
"what else is there to say"

995
01:38:49,541 --> 01:38:53,208
"I choose your embrace over heaven"

996
01:38:53,708 --> 01:38:57,375
"You entered my life like a beautiful dawn."

997
01:38:57,875 --> 01:39:01,375
"Giving me a reason to live."

998
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:43,666
Welcome to Somalia. - Thank you.

999
01:39:44,166 --> 01:39:47,666
You got anything for me? - Take the plane.

1000
01:40:22,625 --> 01:40:26,125
We welcome you to Karachi, Pakistan.

1001
01:40:45,625 --> 01:40:47,166
Welcome to Pakistan, sir.

1002
01:40:47,666 --> 01:40:49,000
Any special reason to come here?

1003
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,666
Her grandfather died in the blast.

1004
01:40:52,166 --> 01:40:52,791
If you hurry up..

1005
01:40:53,291 --> 01:40:56,791
.. then we can take part in the final rites.

1006
01:41:03,541 --> 01:41:04,416
Thank you.

1007
01:41:04,916 --> 01:41:05,958
Anytime, brother.

1008
01:41:06,458 --> 01:41:07,416
Next please.

1009
01:41:07,916 --> 01:41:11,416
Hello.

1010
01:41:18,041 --> 01:41:21,125
Relax. We are outside the airport.

1011
01:41:21,625 --> 01:41:26,125
You were fantastic.

1012
01:41:26,625 --> 01:41:29,625
I have returned after 15 years.

1013
01:41:30,125 --> 01:41:33,625
My home was on the next left.

1014
01:41:37,125 --> 01:41:41,291
Sorry to disturb your memories.

1015
01:41:41,791 --> 01:41:44,708
It's a one hour journey.

1016
01:41:45,208 --> 01:41:48,708
You can cry all you want.

1017
01:42:22,583 --> 01:42:24,916
Move, move.

1018
01:42:25,416 --> 01:42:28,916
Move the car.

1019
01:42:48,916 --> 01:42:51,041
Third on the most wanted list.

1020
01:42:51,541 --> 01:42:55,041
Taimoor Pasha.

1021
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:07,583
How will we get in?

1022
01:43:08,083 --> 01:43:11,583
I was wondering how we will get out?

1023
01:43:18,916 --> 01:43:21,708
You? Did you recognize me?

1024
01:43:22,208 --> 01:43:23,833
Farah. Farah Faqqesh.

1025
01:43:24,333 --> 01:43:27,458
I know your name isn't Kapil Dev.

1026
01:43:27,958 --> 01:43:30,208
Iram Bilal.

1027
01:43:30,708 --> 01:43:31,583
Can you get us inside?

1028
01:43:32,083 --> 01:43:33,208
Of course.

1029
01:43:33,708 --> 01:43:37,666
They're with me.

1030
01:43:38,166 --> 01:43:39,708
Come.

1031
01:43:40,208 --> 01:43:43,708
Move on.

1032
01:43:46,541 --> 01:43:50,041
The program's on the 10th floor.

1033
01:43:54,208 --> 01:43:55,458
Can you hide her somewhere?

1034
01:43:55,958 --> 01:43:58,291
By God. This beautiful face isn't for hiding.

1035
01:43:58,791 --> 01:44:02,291
Together we will steal everyone's heart.

1036
01:44:09,458 --> 01:44:12,958
Hello.

1037
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:35,708
"He looked at me."

1038
01:44:36,208 --> 01:44:40,666
"And it's made me crazy."

1039
01:44:41,166 --> 01:44:48,166
"Now that he has touched me.. "

1040
01:44:48,666 --> 01:44:56,833
"I feel anew."

1041
01:44:57,333 --> 01:45:00,500
"I have many lovers."

1042
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,750
"But if you can win me over."

1043
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:10,916
"Take my heart for free."

1044
01:45:11,416 --> 01:45:14,291
"The poor souls are so distressed."

1045
01:45:14,791 --> 01:45:17,875
"But if you can win me over."

1046
01:45:18,375 --> 01:45:24,750
"Take my heart for free."

1047
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:32,166
"Take my heart for free."

1048
01:45:32,666 --> 01:45:35,416
"Your eyes are so bewitching."

1049
01:45:35,916 --> 01:45:39,000
"Your eyes are so bewitching."

1050
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:43,125
"They put me in an illusion."

1051
01:45:43,625 --> 01:45:45,958
"You're eyes are so bewitching."

1052
01:45:46,458 --> 01:45:50,208
"They put me in an illusion."

1053
01:45:50,708 --> 01:45:53,916
"There are others craving for my love."

1054
01:45:54,416 --> 01:45:57,916
"I am a bit nice, but they are cheats."

1055
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:04,291
"There are others craving for my love."

1056
01:46:04,791 --> 01:46:07,875
"I am a bit nice, but they are cheats."

1057
01:46:08,375 --> 01:46:11,541
"My heart's invaluable, it's not for everyone."

1058
01:46:12,041 --> 01:46:14,458
"But I need to give it away for your sake."

1059
01:46:14,958 --> 01:46:17,958
"The entire market's sold today."

1060
01:46:18,458 --> 01:46:21,166
"But if you can win me over."

1061
01:46:21,666 --> 01:46:28,208
"Take my heart for free."

1062
01:46:28,708 --> 01:46:31,750
"I have many lovers."

1063
01:46:32,250 --> 01:46:35,208
"But if you can win me over."

1064
01:46:35,708 --> 01:46:39,208
"Take my heart for free."

1065
01:47:07,416 --> 01:47:11,041
Hello.

1066
01:47:11,541 --> 01:47:13,666
I need you to deliver package to Delhi.

1067
01:47:14,166 --> 01:47:16,875
What is it this time? - The usual.

1068
01:47:17,375 --> 01:47:18,125
Don't you get bored?

1069
01:47:18,625 --> 01:47:22,125
I am bored.

1070
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:28,958
A small gift for you.

1071
01:47:29,458 --> 01:47:32,375
"I thought of buying your heart as well."

1072
01:47:32,875 --> 01:47:39,208
"Name the price, show the receipt."

1073
01:47:39,708 --> 01:47:42,916
"I thought of buying your heart as well."

1074
01:47:43,416 --> 01:47:46,500
"Name the price, show the receipt."

1075
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,041
"Then I can make you anything you want."

1076
01:47:50,541 --> 01:47:52,958
"You'll have eyes only for me." - A small gift, for you.

1077
01:47:53,458 --> 01:47:56,208
"You're the only one I lost my heart to."

1078
01:47:56,708 --> 01:47:59,708
"But if you can win me over."

1079
01:48:00,208 --> 01:48:06,666
"Take my heart for free."

1080
01:48:07,166 --> 01:48:10,333
"I have many lovers."

1081
01:48:10,833 --> 01:48:13,708
"But if you can win me over."

1082
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:16,125
"Take my heart for free."

1083
01:48:16,625 --> 01:48:19,916
Tell Gajja that he'll receive a box of sweets.

1084
01:48:20,416 --> 01:48:25,041
The delivery should me made to Blue Bird in Delhi.

1085
01:48:25,541 --> 01:48:29,041
Understood. Goodbye.

1086
01:48:32,458 --> 01:48:35,291
"I can't live a moment with you."

1087
01:48:35,791 --> 01:48:38,791
"I can't live a moment with you."

1088
01:48:39,291 --> 01:48:42,291
"I can't live a moment with you."

1089
01:48:42,791 --> 01:48:46,291
"I can't live a moment with you."

1090
01:48:53,375 --> 01:48:56,375
"I can't live a moment with you."

1091
01:48:56,875 --> 01:49:00,375
"I can't live a moment with you."

1092
01:49:05,250 --> 01:49:06,875
What kind of security is this?

1093
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:08,458
Who is this girl?

1094
01:49:08,958 --> 01:49:10,875
Interpol, Indian government, who is behind her?

1095
01:49:11,375 --> 01:49:14,875
We will find out. - Find out.

1096
01:49:19,708 --> 01:49:21,291
Who are you?

1097
01:49:21,791 --> 01:49:23,958
Who do you work for?

1098
01:49:24,458 --> 01:49:27,000
I work for Pakistan.

1099
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:31,000
Who do you work for?

1100
01:49:40,083 --> 01:49:41,458
What is this?

1101
01:49:41,958 --> 01:49:42,791
The longer you take..

1102
01:49:43,291 --> 01:49:45,041
.. the more fun it will be for me

1103
01:49:45,541 --> 01:49:46,458
Don't worry about me.

1104
01:49:46,958 --> 01:49:48,375
I am in my own country.

1105
01:49:48,875 --> 01:49:52,208
You leave. Good bye.

1106
01:49:52,708 --> 01:49:53,625
There's another spy here.

1107
01:49:54,125 --> 01:49:57,625
Find him.

1108
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:02,166
This is him.

1109
01:50:02,666 --> 01:50:05,125
Listen.. excuse me..

1110
01:50:05,625 --> 01:50:06,666
I am sorry.

1111
01:50:07,166 --> 01:50:08,708
We've found the spy.

1112
01:50:09,208 --> 01:50:11,416
Listen to me.

1113
01:50:11,916 --> 01:50:13,250
Your partner's been caught.

1114
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:14,666
You are a traitor.

1115
01:50:15,166 --> 01:50:17,375
That's why Gen. lftekhaar never trusted you.

1116
01:50:17,875 --> 01:50:20,083
I am sure you are responsible for his death.

1117
01:50:20,583 --> 01:50:24,250
How do you know General lftekhaar?

1118
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:27,166
Leave me. I haven't done anything.

1119
01:50:27,666 --> 01:50:31,625
What.. what is happening here?

1120
01:50:32,125 --> 01:50:33,000
I haven't done anything.

1121
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:34,958
I swear.

1122
01:50:35,458 --> 01:50:37,875
I was only eating betel leaf.

1123
01:50:38,375 --> 01:50:41,125
Chewing betel leaf is allowed.

1124
01:50:41,625 --> 01:50:42,875
Is he your partner?

1125
01:50:43,375 --> 01:50:44,541
I don't know him.

1126
01:50:45,041 --> 01:50:46,000
I don't know her personally.

1127
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:47,916
I saw her performing at the dance

1128
01:50:48,416 --> 01:50:49,708
She was singing.

1129
01:50:50,208 --> 01:50:53,125
I swear.. I swear I haven't done anything.

1130
01:50:53,625 --> 01:50:54,750
I came with the wedding procession from Rawalpindi.

1131
01:50:55,250 --> 01:50:55,791
And my father..

1132
01:50:56,291 --> 01:50:58,208
Father own a reputed hotel.

1133
01:50:58,708 --> 01:51:05,958
Your days of spying are over.. my friend.

1134
01:51:06,458 --> 01:51:09,208
Every dog has his day.

1135
01:51:09,708 --> 01:51:12,000
What is Blue Bird?

1136
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:13,708
How dare you ask me questions?

1137
01:51:14,208 --> 01:51:15,333
Have you captured me?

1138
01:51:15,833 --> 01:51:21,250
There's going to be a big blast in Delhi tomorrow.

1139
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:24,875
Unfortunately you won't be there to see it.

1140
01:51:25,375 --> 01:51:27,041
Won't you fulfill my last wish, Colonel?

1141
01:51:27,541 --> 01:51:29,375
You want a chopper to get out of here?

1142
01:51:29,875 --> 01:51:31,250
I want a chilled beer.

1143
01:51:31,750 --> 01:51:36,250
I am sure you can arrange for it.

1144
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:38,250
Get him a beer.

1145
01:51:38,750 --> 01:51:40,500
But don't give him the bottle.

1146
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:41,875
Bring it in a paper cup.

1147
01:51:42,375 --> 01:51:43,666
He's very cunning.

1148
01:51:44,166 --> 01:51:45,458
Anything else.

1149
01:51:45,958 --> 01:51:49,458
Juice for you?

1150
01:51:58,250 --> 01:52:01,750
Thank you.

1151
01:52:23,333 --> 01:52:26,833
Will you marry me?

1152
01:52:56,458 --> 01:52:57,375
Where to now?

1153
01:52:57,875 --> 01:52:58,541
Delhi.

1154
01:52:59,041 --> 01:53:00,375
We're in Karachi?

1155
01:53:00,875 --> 01:53:04,375
We need to reach Jahangir point in ten minutes.

1156
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:47,625
Welcome.

1157
01:53:48,125 --> 01:53:49,458
The pilot says we'll leave at dawn.

1158
01:53:49,958 --> 01:53:50,625
You'll be in Delhi in two hours.

1159
01:53:51,125 --> 01:53:54,625
All the arrangements have been done.

1160
01:54:08,833 --> 01:54:09,875
You will have to fly really low..

1161
01:54:10,375 --> 01:54:13,875
.. for the Geiger counter to detect any radiation.

1162
01:54:17,791 --> 01:54:19,000
But what is wrong? Tell me.

1163
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:21,000
Sorry, sir. I cannot tell you anything.

1164
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:25,000
Mr. Nawaz is going to brief you.

1165
01:54:35,375 --> 01:54:38,791
You cannot make baseless allegations against Pakistan.

1166
01:54:39,291 --> 01:54:39,833
Do you have evidence?

1167
01:54:40,333 --> 01:54:43,125
Colonel Huzefa mentioned 'Blue Bird'.

1168
01:54:43,625 --> 01:54:46,500
What is 'Blue Bird'? - Colonel Huzefa died in Karachi yesterday.

1169
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,708
So how can you say that he's involved?

1170
01:54:49,208 --> 01:54:51,500
I saw him giving orders myself.

1171
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:52,750
Tehmur Pasha was present there as well.

1172
01:54:53,250 --> 01:54:54,500
They spoke about the bomb

1173
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
You're betraying your country, and accusing others.

1174
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:59,791
The meeting is over. - No, it's not over.

1175
01:55:00,291 --> 01:55:03,666
If this bomb explodes in Delhi, there'll be nuclear war.

1176
01:55:04,166 --> 01:55:05,166
We will launch a counter attack. In 20 minutes,

1177
01:55:05,666 --> 01:55:06,916
Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad will be annihilated.

1178
01:55:07,416 --> 01:55:09,000
More than 60 lakh people will die on both sides.

1179
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:10,833
If you say Pakistan isn't involved..

1180
01:55:11,333 --> 01:55:12,625
.. then this is the time to prove it.

1181
01:55:13,125 --> 01:55:13,750
What is Blue Bird?

1182
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:16,500
Name? Place? What is it?

1183
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:20,375
Believe me, I don't know.

1184
01:55:20,875 --> 01:55:23,583
Mr. Khan, I can be court-martialed for bringing you here.

1185
01:55:24,083 --> 01:55:26,166
But millions can be saved as well.

1186
01:55:26,666 --> 01:55:28,708
Control room. 10 geo-stationary satellites.

1187
01:55:29,208 --> 01:55:31,291
And two roaming.

1188
01:55:31,791 --> 01:55:34,750
There are more than 4000 cameras installed in Delhi.

1189
01:55:35,250 --> 01:55:36,083
We can see everything.

1190
01:55:36,583 --> 01:55:39,000
And maybe you can see your wife in one of these cameras..

1191
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:41,833
.. who just returned home after dropping your kids to school.

1192
01:55:42,333 --> 01:55:44,750
There are other mothers, children, families who have no idea..

1193
01:55:45,250 --> 01:55:48,000
.. that everything will be over in four hours.

1194
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:50,375
I believe it, Mr. Khan. That you don't know.

1195
01:55:50,875 --> 01:55:51,833
But there must be someone in Pakistan..

1196
01:55:52,333 --> 01:55:53,583
..in ISI or in your embassy..

1197
01:55:54,083 --> 01:55:57,583
..who knows! Please, find out.

1198
01:56:14,583 --> 01:56:17,625
"These days he never stops anyone."

1199
01:56:18,125 --> 01:56:21,791
"No matter what you do, it never interferes."

1200
01:56:22,291 --> 01:56:25,666
"There's loot and plunder all around, and destruction."

1201
01:56:26,166 --> 01:56:28,291
"God is up above, and we're on earth."

1202
01:56:28,791 --> 01:56:29,708
Would you like to have tea?

1203
01:56:30,208 --> 01:56:33,708
"These days He pays less attention to us."

1204
01:56:37,375 --> 01:56:39,791
One world government.

1205
01:56:40,291 --> 01:56:43,500
Look I've never understood this term.

1206
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
We are a small circle of friends.

1207
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:53,666
Including top bankers, oil magnets, media personalities..

1208
01:56:54,166 --> 01:56:57,083
.. political figures, even an ex-president of the United States.

1209
01:56:57,583 --> 01:57:01,791
Yes. And this group has control over almost the entire world economy.

1210
01:57:02,291 --> 01:57:05,125
Maybe what you are saying is right.

1211
01:57:05,625 --> 01:57:07,125
But these immense resources.

1212
01:57:07,625 --> 01:57:11,916
If they are used properly, then anything is possible.

1213
01:57:12,416 --> 01:57:14,458
Governments have their own agenda.

1214
01:57:14,958 --> 01:57:16,208
Their own programs.

1215
01:57:16,708 --> 01:57:18,500
But at the end of the day..

1216
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:22,500
.. it is the individual that matters.

1217
01:58:09,250 --> 01:58:10,708
Blue Bird is the Lashkar's safe house..

1218
01:58:11,208 --> 01:58:12,791
.. and Professor Yusuf Malik's house.

1219
01:58:13,291 --> 01:58:16,041
Ashiana Bungalow. Khilji road. Behind Qutub complex.

1220
01:58:16,541 --> 01:58:18,000
We cannot raid that place, sir.

1221
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:22,166
What if they press the trigger? - We don't have an option.

1222
01:58:22,666 --> 01:58:26,166
There's one way.

1223
01:58:34,166 --> 01:58:36,125
Professor Malik. - Yes.

1224
01:58:36,625 --> 01:58:37,458
I am Iram.

1225
01:58:37,958 --> 01:58:39,833
Iram Parveen Bilal.

1226
01:58:40,333 --> 01:58:41,375
I want to meet the Colonel.

1227
01:58:41,875 --> 01:58:44,000
Who?

1228
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:45,250
You've got the wrong address.

1229
01:58:45,750 --> 01:58:48,083
Please.

1230
01:58:48,583 --> 01:58:49,916
Iram.

1231
01:58:50,416 --> 01:58:52,041
Last year, London bombings.

1232
01:58:52,541 --> 01:58:55,833
Is the Colonel here or not?

1233
01:58:56,333 --> 01:58:59,333
Come in.

1234
01:58:59,833 --> 01:59:01,958
The Colonel didn't mention anything about you.

1235
01:59:02,458 --> 01:59:03,041
Where is he?

1236
01:59:03,541 --> 01:59:06,708
He's gone to the bus stop.

1237
01:59:07,208 --> 01:59:10,166
Will be back soon.

1238
01:59:10,666 --> 01:59:14,166
How far? - He'll be back.

1239
01:59:25,625 --> 01:59:26,541
Will you have tea?

1240
01:59:27,041 --> 01:59:30,541
Yes, thank you.

1241
01:59:42,625 --> 01:59:46,125
What is that?

1242
02:00:04,375 --> 02:00:05,958
Locate HOHO bus 6DL 3323.

1243
02:00:06,458 --> 02:00:08,125
Next stop is Red Fort.

1244
02:00:08,625 --> 02:00:10,041
Stay at Red Fort, one hour. - Built in 1638.

1245
02:00:10,541 --> 02:00:14,041
Come, ma'am, take care of your belongings.

1246
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,208
I am heading towards the bus.

1247
02:00:19,708 --> 02:00:23,208
Are you ok?

1248
02:00:33,916 --> 02:00:37,583
Why are you standing? Sit down.

1249
02:00:38,083 --> 02:00:41,583
I am fine, thank you.

1250
02:00:48,833 --> 02:00:52,333
I will get biscuits.

1251
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,375
She's working for the cops, Professor.

1252
02:01:00,875 --> 02:01:01,583
Kill her.

1253
02:01:02,083 --> 02:01:05,583
And don't disconnect the phone.

1254
02:01:21,833 --> 02:01:25,333
Let it be, I'll do it.

1255
02:01:39,458 --> 02:01:43,625
"I just spoke to the Colonel, you traitor"

1256
02:01:44,125 --> 02:01:47,625
Move in. Move in.

1257
02:02:02,250 --> 02:02:05,750
Are you okay?

1258
02:02:07,625 --> 02:02:09,041
He just called the Colonel. - Ok.

1259
02:02:09,541 --> 02:02:13,125
Triangulate this number. 9810160605.

1260
02:02:13,625 --> 02:02:15,541
Triangulating 9810160605.

1261
02:02:16,041 --> 02:02:17,416
Sir, this number has been switched off.

1262
02:02:17,916 --> 02:02:19,458
Near Pari Chowk, Noida. I am sending a chopper.

1263
02:02:19,958 --> 02:02:21,375
Jimmy, get out of the bus.

1264
02:02:21,875 --> 02:02:23,333
And find your own way to the target.

1265
02:02:23,833 --> 02:02:27,666
No, don't touch the timer until I say so.

1266
02:02:28,166 --> 02:02:29,833
"Since Bisleri got popular."

1267
02:02:30,333 --> 02:02:31,791
"Everyone forgot about wells and handpumps."

1268
02:02:32,291 --> 02:02:33,833
"Since Bisleri got popular."

1269
02:02:34,333 --> 02:02:35,583
"Everyone forgot about wells and handpumps."

1270
02:02:36,083 --> 02:02:37,708
"Even though farmers produced food-grains."

1271
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:40,000
"They had to commit suicide."

1272
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:41,416
Where to, sir? - Janpath.

1273
02:02:41,916 --> 02:02:42,708
That will be Rs. 200.

1274
02:02:43,208 --> 02:02:46,708
Let's go.

1275
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:51,833
What's in the bag? - Nothing.

1276
02:02:52,333 --> 02:02:55,833
Can I see?

1277
02:03:00,416 --> 02:03:01,541
The call's been triangulated in Noida.

1278
02:03:02,041 --> 02:03:03,708
Cell tower 26 D. come on, move.

1279
02:03:04,208 --> 02:03:07,708
How far is Noida? - Five minutes.

1280
02:03:12,583 --> 02:03:13,750
Move. Move. Move.

1281
02:03:14,250 --> 02:03:17,250
Move.

1282
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:21,250
Move.

1283
02:03:51,333 --> 02:03:51,875
Hello, sir.

1284
02:03:52,375 --> 02:03:53,375
Yes, I've left the bus.

1285
02:03:53,875 --> 02:03:54,791
Take us to Kinari Bazaar.

1286
02:03:55,291 --> 02:03:57,000
Kinari Bazaar.

1287
02:03:57,500 --> 02:03:58,208
I'm heading straight. Please get down.

1288
02:03:58,708 --> 02:04:02,375
We've sat down now. Let's go.

1289
02:04:02,875 --> 02:04:04,333
It's a smart dress.

1290
02:04:04,833 --> 02:04:05,750
But it makes me look fat.

1291
02:04:06,250 --> 02:04:10,791
- I love sarees. - I look very smart.

1292
02:04:11,291 --> 02:04:12,583
I think this guy is taking us for a ride.

1293
02:04:13,083 --> 02:04:14,166
Where are you going?

1294
02:04:14,666 --> 02:04:15,500
Turn around. Take a U-turn.

1295
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,375
Can't you hear?

1296
02:04:17,875 --> 02:04:18,416
Are you deaf?

1297
02:04:18,916 --> 02:04:20,250
Get down at the signal. - Why should we get down?

1298
02:04:20,750 --> 02:04:23,291
Get down at the signal. - I'll make the inspector teach you a lesson.

1299
02:04:23,791 --> 02:04:25,833
Look, sir. He's really.. - Get down.

1300
02:04:26,333 --> 02:04:27,708
What's wrong? Why are you screaming?

1301
02:04:28,208 --> 02:04:31,708
What is wrong?

1302
02:04:44,875 --> 02:04:45,833
He has the bomb.

1303
02:04:46,333 --> 02:04:47,333
Don't give him a chance to press the trigger.

1304
02:04:47,833 --> 02:04:48,458
Shoot only if you get a headshot.

1305
02:04:48,958 --> 02:04:49,708
Only if you get a headshot.

1306
02:04:50,208 --> 02:04:51,375
Not receiving Cam 56 from Barakhambha.

1307
02:04:51,875 --> 02:04:55,375
Cam 3 zoom in. Stay.

1308
02:04:58,166 --> 02:04:59,083
He's taken the ITO flyover.

1309
02:04:59,583 --> 02:05:02,750
He's entered the one way from the opposite side.

1310
02:05:03,250 --> 02:05:06,750
Why aren't you listening?

1311
02:05:49,333 --> 02:05:52,833
Oh, God!

1312
02:06:03,458 --> 02:06:05,041
We are checking the area around the cell tower, sir.

1313
02:06:05,541 --> 02:06:06,208
The mobile phone is switched off.

1314
02:06:06,708 --> 02:06:07,500
Frankly he can be anywhere.

1315
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,333
Sir Metla is here for a charity program.

1316
02:06:09,833 --> 02:06:11,791
That is why there is a lot of crowd, sir.

1317
02:06:12,291 --> 02:06:13,708
Yes, certainly.

1318
02:06:14,208 --> 02:06:15,375
Dr. Ruby. - Sir Metla.

1319
02:06:15,875 --> 02:06:17,375
What are you doing here?

1320
02:06:17,875 --> 02:06:19,416
You are here for a charity function.

1321
02:06:19,916 --> 02:06:23,458
I don't do charity. I do investments.

1322
02:06:23,958 --> 02:06:25,791
We're getting late.

1323
02:06:26,291 --> 02:06:29,791
Good, sir. Good.

1324
02:06:32,958 --> 02:06:35,041
Move it. Clear the traffic. Move them.

1325
02:06:35,541 --> 02:06:39,041
Sir, driver body.

1326
02:07:53,875 --> 02:07:57,375
Bomb! Bomb!

1327
02:08:27,291 --> 02:08:30,791
I lost him.

1328
02:08:39,916 --> 02:08:41,208
Iram, come in.

1329
02:08:41,708 --> 02:08:45,208
Iram, come in. Iram, come in.

1330
02:08:53,291 --> 02:08:54,875
Thank you for your hospitality.

1331
02:08:55,375 --> 02:08:57,541
Is there a scheduled time for the helicopter to leave?

1332
02:08:58,041 --> 02:09:00,583
We should go now. It's really getting late now.

1333
02:09:01,083 --> 02:09:01,833
There was a technical problem, sir.

1334
02:09:02,333 --> 02:09:03,375
It's been solved. But we should leave immediately.

1335
02:09:03,875 --> 02:09:07,625
Okay, let's go.

1336
02:09:08,125 --> 02:09:11,625
I will think about it.

1337
02:09:13,958 --> 02:09:17,458
The pilot is the Colonel.

1338
02:09:26,416 --> 02:09:29,541
Get in. Get in.

1339
02:09:30,041 --> 02:09:31,333
Stop.

1340
02:09:31,833 --> 02:09:34,750
My glasses.

1341
02:09:35,250 --> 02:09:37,208
I need my glasses.

1342
02:09:37,708 --> 02:09:41,208
Please, my glasses.

1343
02:09:45,041 --> 02:09:48,541
Rascal.

1344
02:10:02,958 --> 02:10:05,083
Colonel, I am in an ice-cream parlor at Connaught Place.

1345
02:10:05,583 --> 02:10:06,250
Nirula's.

1346
02:10:06,750 --> 02:10:07,458
Only nine minutes left.

1347
02:10:07,958 --> 02:10:11,458
I will call you again.

1348
02:10:34,458 --> 02:10:37,958
Happy birthday to you.

1349
02:11:19,666 --> 02:11:20,750
Everybody out.

1350
02:11:21,250 --> 02:11:22,916
Get out, come on.

1351
02:11:23,416 --> 02:11:24,250
Go.

1352
02:11:24,750 --> 02:11:25,708
Everybody out.

1353
02:11:26,208 --> 02:11:27,375
Everybody out.

1354
02:11:27,875 --> 02:11:31,375
Go, go, go.

1355
02:11:48,791 --> 02:11:50,333
Darn it.

1356
02:11:50,833 --> 02:11:52,458
Sir. I have found the bomb.

1357
02:11:52,958 --> 02:11:53,750
It's demanding a password.

1358
02:11:54,250 --> 02:11:55,916
Run, run. Vacate the place.

1359
02:11:56,416 --> 02:11:59,916
Everybody out.

1360
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,458
Hurry up.

1361
02:12:13,958 --> 02:12:17,458
Come on, come on, come on everybody.

1362
02:12:28,333 --> 02:12:29,541
The firing circuit has completely failed.

1363
02:12:30,041 --> 02:12:30,541
I will have to open it completely.

1364
02:12:31,041 --> 02:12:32,041
Open it. - That will take time.

1365
02:12:32,541 --> 02:12:36,041
At least 15-20 minutes.

1366
02:13:00,250 --> 02:13:02,500
Ground all choppers, sir. Only four minutes left.

1367
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:03,666
Waiting for coordinates.

1368
02:13:04,166 --> 02:13:06,625
Get me the map for outer Delhi.

1369
02:13:07,125 --> 02:13:09,541
Fly north by north east, Radial 045.

1370
02:13:10,041 --> 02:13:10,958
Fly high for the first two minutes.

1371
02:13:11,458 --> 02:13:12,458
Then at 500 feet for the last minute.

1372
02:13:12,958 --> 02:13:13,958
Setting course, north by north east.

1373
02:13:14,458 --> 02:13:17,875
Radial 045.

1374
02:13:18,375 --> 02:13:18,833
The old copper mine is seven kilometers away..

1375
02:13:19,333 --> 02:13:19,916
..from Delhi-Jaipur Highway.

1376
02:13:20,416 --> 02:13:21,000
You'll see an old copper mine.

1377
02:13:21,500 --> 02:13:22,791
The mine is 2000 feet deep

1378
02:13:23,291 --> 02:13:26,791
Crash the bomb in the mine. - Roger that, sir.

1379
02:13:43,875 --> 02:13:45,833
It was a privilege serving with you, my boy.

1380
02:13:46,333 --> 02:13:47,708
Jai Hind, sir.

1381
02:13:48,208 --> 02:13:49,916
Requesting personal time.

1382
02:13:50,416 --> 02:13:53,916
Connect me to Iram, sir.

1383
02:14:02,333 --> 02:14:03,625
Iram. Iram.

1384
02:14:04,125 --> 02:14:06,041
I know that. Iram, it's Vinod.

1385
02:14:06,541 --> 02:14:08,916
Iram. - Is everything okay?

1386
02:14:09,416 --> 02:14:10,416
Under control.

1387
02:14:10,916 --> 02:14:14,083
Are you fine? - I am not going to make it, Vinod.

1388
02:14:14,583 --> 02:14:15,208
What happened?

1389
02:14:15,708 --> 02:14:18,333
That bastard shot me. - Where are you hit?

1390
02:14:18,833 --> 02:14:21,458
How bad is it? - Two bullets on the liver.

1391
02:14:21,958 --> 02:14:23,125
I've lost lot of blood.

1392
02:14:23,625 --> 02:14:29,000
Can you come here? Please.

1393
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:32,708
What happened? Can you come here?

1394
02:14:33,208 --> 02:14:36,208
I am in the helicopter, with the bomb.

1395
02:14:36,708 --> 02:14:40,250
Trying to take it as far away from the city as possible.

1396
02:14:40,750 --> 02:14:42,750
Why.. Why can't we diffuse the bomb?

1397
02:14:43,250 --> 02:14:46,750
It's asking for the password, which I don't have.

1398
02:14:49,500 --> 02:14:51,000
Listen to me, Iram.

1399
02:14:51,500 --> 02:14:52,750
I had decided..

1400
02:14:53,250 --> 02:14:59,250
.. that I would try and give you the life you wanted.

1401
02:14:59,750 --> 02:15:03,250
I just want you to know that I had decided that.

1402
02:15:06,541 --> 02:15:08,000
If there is something on the other side..

1403
02:15:08,500 --> 02:15:12,000
Then we'll meet soon.

1404
02:15:14,583 --> 02:15:16,541
Just one minute left.

1405
02:15:17,041 --> 02:15:20,541
Say something terrific.

1406
02:15:22,916 --> 02:15:25,250
Stay with me.

1407
02:15:25,750 --> 02:15:28,208
Iram.

1408
02:15:28,708 --> 02:15:31,333
Press it. Press it.

1409
02:15:31,833 --> 02:15:36,166
Password.

1410
02:15:36,666 --> 02:15:39,875
Kazan set it in Morocco.

1411
02:15:40,375 --> 02:15:40,875
Kazan?

1412
02:15:41,375 --> 02:15:42,916
Do you know the password?

1413
02:15:43,416 --> 02:15:44,125
Do you know his mother's name?

1414
02:15:44,625 --> 02:15:48,000
He killed her himself. - What?

1415
02:15:48,500 --> 02:15:50,500
Who? - Zilleh.

1416
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,208
Zilleh? - Zilleh. Zilleh.

1417
02:15:53,708 --> 02:15:54,750
Who's Zilleh?

1418
02:15:55,250 --> 02:15:57,083
Who Iram?

1419
02:15:57,583 --> 02:15:59,291
His pet camel

1420
02:15:59,791 --> 02:16:01,000
Zilleh.

1421
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:02,041
Spell it.

1422
02:16:02,541 --> 02:16:03,291
Can you spell it?

1423
02:16:03,791 --> 02:16:07,125
Z I L L..

1424
02:16:07,625 --> 02:16:11,125
Iram. - E H.

1425
02:16:19,500 --> 02:16:23,000
We did it.

1426
02:16:25,375 --> 02:16:28,875
We made it, baby.

1427
02:17:13,416 --> 02:17:16,916
You wanted a world..

1428
02:17:17,416 --> 02:17:20,916
.. where this Rubaiyat is just a book of poems.

1429
02:17:26,708 --> 02:17:30,208
Maybe you are in such a world now.

1430
02:17:56,750 --> 02:17:59,166
We found this on the Colonel's body.

1431
02:17:59,666 --> 02:18:02,000
Possibly his insurance policy.

1432
02:18:02,500 --> 02:18:06,000
Check it.

1433
02:18:08,166 --> 02:18:11,708
We cannot touch this man.

1434
02:18:12,208 --> 02:18:15,708
He's beyond our reach.

1435
02:18:16,208 --> 02:18:21,833
And its impossible to prove anything in court.

1436
02:18:22,333 --> 02:18:24,333
If anything happens to him.

1437
02:18:24,833 --> 02:18:28,333
An accident or..

1438
02:18:31,250 --> 02:18:34,750
Cheers.

1439
02:18:39,750 --> 02:18:42,333
In the last 48 hours Pakistan's army has raided..

1440
02:18:42,833 --> 02:18:45,333
..training camps and many sleeper cells of Lashkar.

1441
02:18:45,833 --> 02:18:48,083
And more than 200 operatives have been killed..

1442
02:18:48,583 --> 02:18:50,958
..and around 600 have been arrested.

1443
02:18:51,458 --> 02:18:52,083
These raids have served..

1444
02:18:52,583 --> 02:18:56,083
..a harsh blow to many terrorist organizations like Lashkar.

1445
02:18:59,750 --> 02:19:02,750
Sayyad, don't ask who I am.

1446
02:19:03,250 --> 02:19:04,583
Just listen carefully.

1447
02:19:05,083 --> 02:19:08,583
I know who's behind the incident that took place in Delhi.

1448
02:19:21,166 --> 02:19:24,125
Freddie Khambatta. - Agent Vinod, sir.

1449
02:19:24,625 --> 02:19:28,125
I would like to show you something.

1450
02:19:29,708 --> 02:19:32,958
Am I making myself clear? - Yes.

1451
02:19:33,458 --> 02:19:36,916
Lashkar is the most active group these days.

1452
02:19:37,416 --> 02:19:38,958
Yes.

1453
02:19:39,458 --> 02:19:43,541
The Zeus group doesn't want any publicity.

1454
02:19:44,041 --> 02:19:47,541
No comebacks.

1455
02:19:49,666 --> 02:19:51,166
I will cover my footsteps.

1456
02:19:51,666 --> 02:19:54,000
But what's the guarantee that you will spare me..

1457
02:19:54,500 --> 02:19:55,625
.. after the job's done?

1458
02:19:56,125 --> 02:20:00,875
There'll be 25 million Euros in your bank.

1459
02:20:01,375 --> 02:20:03,000
You take care of that.

1460
02:20:03,500 --> 02:20:05,541
And let us take care of the world.

1461
02:20:06,041 --> 02:20:09,541
Cheers. - Cheers.

1462
02:20:16,041 --> 02:20:17,458
What is this?

1463
02:20:17,958 --> 02:20:20,166
Why are you showing this to me?

1464
02:20:20,666 --> 02:20:24,666
My granddaughter shows me such videos on Youtube.

1465
02:20:25,166 --> 02:20:27,000
Smart idea.

1466
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:29,166
You would've exploded the bomb in Delhi.

1467
02:20:29,666 --> 02:20:30,833
And the world would've thought..

1468
02:20:31,333 --> 02:20:33,375
.. that a group like Lashkar is behind it.

1469
02:20:33,875 --> 02:20:37,958
So Colonel used people like Abu, Kazan, Jimmy and Huzefa.

1470
02:20:38,458 --> 02:20:40,250
Put the stamp of Jehad on the operation.

1471
02:20:40,750 --> 02:20:42,416
You wanted to trigger a war between both countries..

1472
02:20:42,916 --> 02:20:44,583
.. and make millions.

1473
02:20:45,083 --> 02:20:48,000
Fascinating theory, Agent Vinod.

1474
02:20:48,500 --> 02:20:49,666
But why did you get this here?

1475
02:20:50,166 --> 02:20:50,916
Take it to the press.

1476
02:20:51,416 --> 02:20:52,875
It'll be fun for a few days.

1477
02:20:53,375 --> 02:20:55,083
But now you must excuse me.

1478
02:20:55,583 --> 02:20:59,083
I need to.. attend a function.

1479
02:21:07,791 --> 02:21:09,708
The Zeus group.

1480
02:21:10,208 --> 02:21:13,958
Great businessmen like you.

1481
02:21:14,458 --> 02:21:16,875
Senators, ex-prime ministers.

1482
02:21:17,375 --> 02:21:18,500
I've heard that whenever you meet..

1483
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,041
.. something strange occurs somewhere in the world.

1484
02:21:21,541 --> 02:21:23,083
Some President's death in a plane crash.

1485
02:21:23,583 --> 02:21:25,791
A civil war in a small country.

1486
02:21:26,291 --> 02:21:28,708
Nuclear blast in New Delhi.

1487
02:21:29,208 --> 02:21:30,166
Wow.

1488
02:21:30,666 --> 02:21:33,000
Wow, Agent Vinod.

1489
02:21:33,500 --> 02:21:37,041
Wow.

1490
02:21:37,541 --> 02:21:40,000
You think you know everything.

1491
02:21:40,500 --> 02:21:43,041
But I want to add to your knowledge.

1492
02:21:43,541 --> 02:21:45,083
A bomb blasts in Delhi.

1493
02:21:45,583 --> 02:21:48,166
But the real explosion happens in the stock exchanges of New York..

1494
02:21:48,666 --> 02:21:51,583
.. London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Beijing

1495
02:21:52,083 --> 02:21:54,750
You would short stocks and make your billions.

1496
02:21:55,250 --> 02:21:57,041
But what about the millions that die in both the countries?

1497
02:21:57,541 --> 02:22:01,375
What about them?

1498
02:22:01,875 --> 02:22:03,083
You know what would've happened to China..

1499
02:22:03,583 --> 02:22:05,750
.. if the stock market had crashed?

1500
02:22:06,250 --> 02:22:09,708
How NATO would've seized Pakistan's nuclear bombs?

1501
02:22:10,208 --> 02:22:13,750
And we could have solved the Iran pipeline situation

1502
02:22:14,250 --> 02:22:15,791
These are complex issues.

1503
02:22:16,291 --> 02:22:18,666
You are a police officer.

1504
02:22:19,166 --> 02:22:22,666
It's beyond your understanding.

1505
02:22:24,833 --> 02:22:28,666
You will have to die. Sir Metla.

1506
02:22:29,166 --> 02:22:31,375
Today.

1507
02:22:31,875 --> 02:22:33,416
You're here to kill me.

1508
02:22:33,916 --> 02:22:36,000
I won't kill you, sir.

1509
02:22:36,500 --> 02:22:39,041
You're a hero in my country.

1510
02:22:39,541 --> 02:22:43,125
And you'll die as a hero.

1511
02:22:43,625 --> 02:22:45,583
There'll be roads built in your name.

1512
02:22:46,083 --> 02:22:48,000
Stamps issued.

1513
02:22:48,500 --> 02:22:52,458
Books written about you..

1514
02:22:52,958 --> 02:22:56,458
Goodbye, sir.

1515
02:23:07,750 --> 02:23:09,000
Sir Metla will be back soon.

1516
02:23:09,500 --> 02:23:13,000
Won't you sit down, sir?

1517
02:23:18,375 --> 02:23:21,875
Coffee, please.

1518
02:23:31,291 --> 02:23:34,791
What's he doing? - Second cup of coffee, sir.

1519
02:24:10,250 --> 02:24:12,625
Sir Metla.

1520
02:24:13,125 --> 02:24:15,041
Sayeed Kousar has sent his regards.

1521
02:24:15,541 --> 02:24:19,041
Who? - Lashkar, sir.

1522
02:24:23,625 --> 02:24:27,125
Bismillah.

1523
02:24:46,958 --> 02:24:49,250
It appears that Sir Metla was killed by the same terror group..

1524
02:24:49,750 --> 02:24:52,041
.. that planned a nuclear attack in New Delhi.

1525
02:24:52,541 --> 02:24:54,083
It was Sir Metla's heroic intervention that..

1526
02:24:54,583 --> 02:24:55,875
.. thwarted the well laid plan.

1527
02:24:56,375 --> 02:24:58,458
Our correspondent Marge Atkins is at the site.

1528
02:24:58,958 --> 02:25:02,458
Tell us what is happening Marge..

1529
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:35,416
I know you.

1530
02:25:35,916 --> 02:25:38,083
You are Freddie Khambatta.

1531
02:25:38,583 --> 02:25:39,958
I don't like that name.

1532
02:25:40,458 --> 02:25:43,958
So what is your name?

1533
02:26:37,250 --> 02:26:38,500
"The bungalow's locked."

1534
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:40,458
"How do I get in?"

1535
02:26:40,958 --> 02:26:42,250
"Laila's window is open."

1536
02:26:42,750 --> 02:26:44,166
"There's a gutter below it."

1537
02:26:44,666 --> 02:26:46,000
"Someone's at the window."

1538
02:26:46,500 --> 02:26:47,875
"Laila's having an affair."

1539
02:26:48,375 --> 02:26:51,000
"She has a blast at the expense of my love."

1540
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:54,791
"My darling, after I am smitten by you."

1541
02:26:55,291 --> 02:26:58,416
"Where are you going blowing away my love?"

1542
02:26:58,916 --> 02:27:02,083
"My darling, after I am smitten by you."

1543
02:27:02,583 --> 02:27:06,000
"Where are you going blowing away my love?"

1544
02:27:06,500 --> 02:27:09,416
"My darling, after I am smitten by you."

1545
02:27:09,916 --> 02:27:13,416
"Where are you going blowing away my love?"

1546
02:27:43,666 --> 02:27:44,875
"She showers her love on everyone."

1547
02:27:45,375 --> 02:27:46,833
"But scolds me when I ask for some."

1548
02:27:47,333 --> 02:27:48,583
"Kisses for everyone else."

1549
02:27:49,083 --> 02:27:50,458
"But just a pat on my cheek."

1550
02:27:50,958 --> 02:27:52,333
"Laila is like a chameleon."

1551
02:27:52,833 --> 02:27:54,166
"Like the beats on the drums."

1552
02:27:54,666 --> 02:27:57,458
"Leaves her lipstick mark on the cheeks with her smooch."

1553
02:27:57,958 --> 02:28:01,958
"My.. My.. my.."

1554
02:28:02,458 --> 02:28:04,750
"My.. after I am smitten by you."

1555
02:28:05,250 --> 02:28:09,000
"Where are you going.. my love?"

1556
02:28:09,500 --> 02:28:12,166
"My darling, after I am smitten by you."

1557
02:28:12,666 --> 02:28:15,833
"Where are you going blowing away my love?"

1558
02:28:16,333 --> 02:28:19,375
"My darling, after I am smitten by you."

1559
02:28:19,875 --> 02:28:23,375
"Where are you going blowing away my love?"

1560
02:28:33,916 --> 02:28:34,625
"P U N G I.. "

1561
02:28:35,125 --> 02:28:41,416
"I am Laila, I will blow your love away."

1562
02:28:41,916 --> 02:28:45,416
"P U N G I.. I am Laila, I will blow your love away."

1563
02:28:56,375 --> 02:29:00,083
"After making those false promises in English."

1564
02:29:00,583 --> 02:29:03,750
"Where are you going blowing away my love?"

1565
02:29:04,250 --> 02:29:07,375
"My darling, after I am smitten by you."

1566
02:29:07,875 --> 02:29:11,083
"Where are you going blowing away my love?"

1567
02:29:11,583 --> 02:29:14,791
"My darling, after I am smitten by you."

1568
02:29:15,291 --> 02:29:19,333
"Where are you going blowing away my love?"
