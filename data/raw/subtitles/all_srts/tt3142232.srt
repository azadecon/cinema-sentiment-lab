00:00:57,466 --> 00:01:01,533
THE HERO ATTITUDE

4
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
One, two, three, four, six

5
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:22,400
Let my heart sing a tune
And let my heartbeat croon

6
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:25,700
I want to smoke
Till my eyes get hazy

7
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:29,033
Come on, guys. Focus in.
It takes so long to focus.

8
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,733
Check the sound.
A-B-C, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.

9
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:34,600
Darling, I don't know what to say
For I'm going crazy

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,633
Have you booked
my return flight ticket?

11
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:39,033
You'll get it.

12
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,233
Don't just say it.
Get it done.

13
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:43,366
And business class.
I only fly business class.

14
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,633
May God save who loves you

15
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:51,000
Your charm is deadly
And so is your love

16
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:52,166
You're emotional

17
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:54,133
Along with all the famous
personalities of the town...

18
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:56,033
...the district collector,
opposition leader...

19
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:59,200
...and everyone is here to congratulate
Chaudhary Suraj Singh...

20
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:02,200
...because today is
his daughter's wedding.

21
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,766
You're fair and cute

22
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:10,766
You're fair and cute

23
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:14,000
The groom will fall
Head over heels in love with you

24
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:16,033
Greetings, Mr. Minister.
Please come.

25
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:20,166
An ant was climbing up the hill.

26
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,166
The ant climbed up the hill.

27
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:25,733
The ant climbed up the hill.

28
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:27,633
When is he going
to get on the hill?

29
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:29,600
It will. It will.

30
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:34,266
An ant was climbing up
the hill for a grain.

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,000
Bachelors find their destiny
in the lane of love.

32
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,366
Son, this is Hekri village.

33
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,766
The Jat Land.

34
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:50,566
Here, love happens
after marriage.

35
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,133
We ask our wife's name
after having two kids.

36
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:57,366
Get lost.

37
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,433
Uncle, start with
our traditional rituals.

38
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:06,266
And that would be Pappi Jat.

39
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,133
DLF's famous goon.

40
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:12,466
That's Mr. Chaudhary's
younger brother.

41
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,266
The bride's first uncle.

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,100
But I read in the papers
he's supposed to be behind bars.

43
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:20,733
Technically, he's still in jail.

44
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,733
Who's he?

45
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:26,066
We've called him from Mumbai
to shoot the wedding video.

46
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,233
He filmed three movies
with Chunky Pandey.

47
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,333
Suspenders!

48
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:34,066
Wonderful!

49
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,700
Shoot a nice video.

50
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,033
Please book my plane ticket.
Economy will do.

51
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:49,133
And that's the famous
encounter specialist...

52
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:51,666
...Bhupender Singh Chaudhary
AKA Bhuppi Blackberry.

53
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,133
The bride's second uncle.

54
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,733
He has committed
42 murders to date.

55
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,800
And If I hadn't been suspended...

56
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,766
...I would've completed
my half century.

57
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,300
Get me suspended.
Get me a train ticket.

58
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:08,500
Bhuppi.

59
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:11,766
He belongs to the brick mafia.
Rajjo Fauji.

60
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:14,500
-Rajjo.
-Pappi!

61
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:16,233
So they all serve in the army?

62
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:18,366
No, they have their own army.

63
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,733
They supply bouncers to all
the discos of Delhi and Haryana.

64
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:25,300
And if any owner doesn't agree...

65
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:28,533
...Pappi and Bhuppi
raid that place.

66
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,066
Disco closed.

67
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,266
I'll take a bus.
Just tell me the number, I'll go.

68
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,500
-Tenne.
-Yes?

69
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:35,700
Sir.

70
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:38,166
Tenne?

71
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
-Sir.
-What about the booze?

72
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:41,666
As usual.

73
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:48,000
Grandpa, you're the eldest in the family.

74
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:49,400
You start.

75
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:52,466
Sukhi, he's my son-in-law.

76
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,033
How can I drink before him?

77
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,766
-So? Why aren't you drinking?
-No one respects me.

78
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,600
-What's wrong, brother-in-law?
-What happened?

79
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,000
What's this?

80
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:04,466
-I don't drink this.
-Then what do you want?

81
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Get me Black Dog.

82
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:09,633
A beauty spot
On your fair cheeks

83
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:12,333
A beauty spot
On your fair cheeks

84
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:15,200
Listen, dear.
Better change your shirt.

85
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,566
The guests are about to arrive.

86
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,033
I am wearing a shirt. Get lost.

87
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:21,700
If he was not
our sister's husband...

88
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,700
...I would've killed him.

89
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,633
Drink up, brother-in-law.

90
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:28,066
Have this before the Black Dog.

91
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,566
-You'll love it. Have it.
-Come on.

92
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,066
Fine. At least, say cheers first.

93
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,533
Say cheers.

94
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,100
Say cheers.

95
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:37,033
Cheers.

96
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,200
Mr. Chaudhary is coming.
Mr. Chaudhary is coming.

97
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,666
Hide it quickly.

98
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,266
It was a mistake, son.
It won't happen again.

99
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:06,333
Mr. Chaudhary.

100
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,000
-Mr. Chaudhary. Focus on him.
-Hello.

101
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:09,433
-Greetings.
-Bless you.

102
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:11,566
-Is everything okay?
-Yes, everything is okay.

103
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,600
Why is everyone
calling him "Bapu"?

104
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:14,733
They are all orphans.

105
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,233
Mr. Chaudhary
pays for their education...

106
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:18,433
...and provides for their family.

107
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:20,333
Isn't he a generous man?

108
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:24,200
Actually, Mr. Chaudhary
killed their fathers.

109
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:26,566
What is this family?

110
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:30,133
Mukesh.

111
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:32,200
Wasn't there a bicycle
parked outside the main gate?

112
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:33,566
You know, Renu...

113
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,200
...the first time your mom
stepped in this house...

114
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,466
...she looked as beautiful as you.

115
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,100
Where's Dimpy?

116
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,600
Dimpy has donned Renu's jewelry
and has gone snap-happy.

117
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:45,766
Dimpy is thoroughly
enjoying Renu's wedding.

118
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,300
Go and call her.

119
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:50,400
Renu.

120
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:56,333
Brother, you're too much.

121
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:58,000
You can't stand her leaving,
can you?

122
00:06:58,266 --> 00:07:00,166
You love her too much.

123
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,500
People from 36 villages
draw inspiration from you.

124
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:05,566
Why are you scared
of sending her away?

125
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:11,000
Renu, my dear.
Seek your dad's blessings.

126
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:40,000
What happened?

127
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:42,500
Don't be scared.

128
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:46,066
I have chosen you a fine suitor
after careful thought.

129
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,166
They are a reputed family.

130
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,300
You'll be showered with love...

131
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:54,333
...and soon you'll even forget
your father.

132
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:02,166
The wedding procession is here.

133
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,033
Time for the rituals.

134
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:06,300
Go on.

135
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:07,633
Get ready.

136
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,233
Close it!

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,233
Get lost!

138
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:09,133
Show her face!
Didn't you hear me?

139
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:16,166
Let's throw him in the fire.

140
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,166
How dare a teacher's son
elope with our daughter!

141
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:25,733
I didn't know Rakesh
would do such a thing.

142
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,533
If I had a clue...

143
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,033
...I would've killed him.

144
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,233
Get up.

145
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:32,633
Who is he?

146
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:35,166
Rakesh's friend.

147
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,366
Three years ago,
they studied together in Delhi.

148
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,633
-Come on!
-Whenever someone elopes...

149
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,733
...their friends definitely know.

150
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:55,566
-Who are you?
-What's going on?

151
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,166
-Hello! Who are you?
-Are you Jitesh?

152
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,333
Yes.

153
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,733
Bang, bang

154
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:04,633
Hi, I am Karan.

155
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,600
You must have heard my name.
I am an actor.

156
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,100
Bang, bang

157
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,266
Two serials, a few films.

158
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,100
Whoa, I quite like this music.

159
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:16,533
Nice club, huh?

160
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,466
What the--

161
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,333
Tell me, where is Rakesh?

162
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:24,500
-We don't know anything. Please.
-Tell the truth.

163
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:27,200
I beg you. Please hear me out.
Sir, please don't hit me.

164
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,433
Tell me, where is Rakesh?

165
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:30,233
-Speak up! We'll beat you.
-Please!

166
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:31,600
Tell us.

167
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:32,733
Tell me, where is Rakesh?
Speak up.

168
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,333
We don't know anything. Bablu....

169
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:36,633
Bablu knows.

170
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:38,066
Bablu knows.

171
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:39,433
Hold on.

172
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:42,166
Sir, please ask Bablu.

173
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,066
They said his name
so many times. Who is he?

174
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,000
That boy seems clever.

175
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,700
He's very cunning.

176
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,100
We sent our boys after him.
But he is never at home.

177
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:57,533
-Pick him up.
-Yes, brother.

178
00:11:01,633 --> 00:11:02,666
Sukhi!

179
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,566
Get the cars.

180
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,566
Take a few more people along.

181
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,533
What did you say?

182
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,433
I said take a few more along.

183
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:22,600
Take a few more people along.

184
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,700
Is Bablu Superman?

185
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:28,533
No, he's an entire army.

186
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:21,100
Are you Bablu?

187
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:24,300
You didn't have to corner me
to ask that.

188
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:27,766
-Where can we find Rakesh?
-Which Rakesh?

189
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:30,433
Rakesh Gupta? Rakesh Tiwari?

190
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:31,633
Rakesh Roshan?

191
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:33,033
Which Rakesh?

192
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,733
The one who studied with you.

193
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:36,566
He eloped with our niece.

194
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,233
What are you saying?

195
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:39,400
Rakesh!

196
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,266
Rakesh eloped!

197
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,233
That calls for a celebration.
I must tell everyone about it.

198
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,600
Listen up.

199
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:59,233
This is Blackberry.

200
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:03,400
It doesn't miss.
It connects directly.

201
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:07,466
Don't push.

202
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Mister, why use your hands
when we can talk?

203
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:15,533
Why? What will you do?

204
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:17,233
Will you hit us?

205
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:20,466
Hit us? Hit--!

206
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:31,166
I didn't think about it...

207
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:34,733
...but now I must.

208
00:13:35,033 --> 00:13:37,533
So you want to be a hero?

209
00:13:38,266 --> 00:13:39,566
Can't help it.

210
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:41,400
Others don't have it.

211
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:44,633
And I can't lose it.

212
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,233
Just tell us, lover boy.
Or else we'll waste you.

213
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,266
Fine.

214
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,666
Okay. I'll tell you.

215
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:56,533
Choose one.

216
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,200
Hold on. No one interferes.
I'll choose.

217
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,366
-I'll choose.
-Please.

218
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,166
Tenne, hurry up.

219
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:05,766
This one.

220
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,300
Where are you hiding those two?

221
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,300
Who hit me from behind?

222
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:50,033
Tell us, where's our daughter?

223
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,733
First, tell me
who hit me from behind.

224
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:54,033
Tell us.

225
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:55,766
Where's our daughter?

226
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:00,600
-Tell us where she is.
-Quiet!

227
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,466
Speak one by one. Or forget it.

228
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,300
Listen.

229
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,266
Your daughter ran away
from home, didn't she?

230
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
She didn't run away
to become a sprinter.

231
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:18,366
I'm sure she ran away
with the boy she loved.

232
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,266
She must've eloped.

233
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:23,433
She wouldn't have eloped...

234
00:17:23,566 --> 00:17:25,433
...if you would've allowed her
to choose her groom.

235
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,466
He was showing
the same attitude back there.

236
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:31,333
I hit you in the head
from behind.

237
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,700
But here, I will knock your head off.

238
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,433
Enough.

239
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Come on.

240
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,100
Give me Rakesh's address.

241
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:45,500
You want Rakesh's address.

242
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,366
Okay.

243
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,000
Let's do this.

244
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:53,100
Whenever he calls,
I'll ask him and let you know.

245
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:54,633
Give me your cell number.

246
00:17:57,566 --> 00:17:59,066
What's wrong?
You don't have a phone.

247
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:03,300
Okay. I'll send a letter to you.

248
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:05,600
I'll leave now. Goodbye.

249
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,300
Wait!

250
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,266
Get one thing straight.

251
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,300
Until I find my daughter...

252
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,066
...you will stay here.

253
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,200
Get in.

254
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,600
Close the door.

255
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:53,500
Bablu.

256
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,700
Bablu.

257
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,066
You too?

258
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,366
With friends like you,
who needs enemies?

259
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:03,266
Who gave them my name?

260
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,466
He did.

261
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,733
He did.

262
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:07,100
Come on.

263
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,666
Bablu.

264
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,166
What happened?

265
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:19,366
Thank God you're here. Save us.

266
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,566
Don't be scared.
I am here now.

267
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,066
I won't let anything
happen to you, okay?

268
00:19:24,466 --> 00:19:27,500
They ruined my face.

269
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,166
If you only get in touch
through Facebook...

270
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:34,133
...that's what's going to
happen to you.

271
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:35,766
-Darn it.
-You think this is funny?

272
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:38,066
-Darn you.
-Bablu.

273
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:39,500
Rascal!

274
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:42,300
We're in such a tough situation
and you're thinking about a reunion.

275
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:43,566
-Darn you.
-Let go!

276
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,766
Excuse me.

277
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,466
Can I join in too?

278
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,200
-Who are you?
-I am Kiki.

279
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,600
I live in London.

280
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:58,566
I came to India
for the first time.

281
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,500
I just asked these Jats for a ride...

282
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,633
...but they beat me up.

283
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:04,266
They brought me here.

284
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,566
It's all because of
his red trousers.

285
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:10,566
A shaman told the Jats
to find a man...

286
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,000
...wearing red trousers in the north...

287
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:14,766
...and that he might know
Rakesh's address.

288
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:16,100
Forget it.

289
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:18,666
-Kiki.
-Yeah?

290
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,166
-Do you know where Rakesh is?
-I don't know any Rakesh.

291
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,233
-How would he know?
-Yeah!

292
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:26,466
-We thought you did.
-I don't know.

293
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,500
-What?
-Darn it!

294
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:30,000
We are in big trouble.

295
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:33,100
I said so!

296
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,633
Back in college, I warned you
that he's a big flirt.

297
00:20:35,766 --> 00:20:38,233
Fine, let's just
sit around here.

298
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:40,133
Listen. Listen.

299
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:41,800
You have to find a way out.

300
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,133
Please get us out of here.

301
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:46,400
-Yeah, please.
-Then choose one.

302
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:48,766
-Enough of you.
-Bablu, I've had enough.

303
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:51,500
May I choose?

304
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:53,700
No....

305
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,033
This one.

306
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:57,266
Good.

307
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:59,733
-Tomorrow, let's party at DU.
-He is at it again.

308
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:01,433
Like old times.

309
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,266
The same attitude again.

310
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,700
You know it, don't you?

311
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,266
Others don't have it.

312
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
-And you can't lose it.
-And you can't lose it.

313
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:10,600
-We know. We know.
-We know. We know.

314
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,533
But you don't know...

315
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,666
...that your hero
has found his heroine.

316
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,766
She was a moon-like beauty
But she was annoyed

317
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:30,000
She was a broken dream
And she was all yours

318
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,166
Somebody fulfilled
My shattered hopes

319
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:42,500
We met but you soon went away

320
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:47,766
Life seems dull

321
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,800
Without you
Without you

322
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,100
Who is she?

323
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:55,633
-What's her name?
-Where does she live?

324
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:57,500
That's all I don't know.

325
00:21:58,733 --> 00:21:59,733
Everything else is all set.

326
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:01,566
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Darn it!

327
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:03,766
We were planning
to run away from here.

328
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:05,533
So, what is the position?

329
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,300
Simple.

330
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,400
There is a railway station
just outside this village.

331
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:13,400
We'll sneak out of here
tomorrow morning.

332
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,700
Next we get on a train.

333
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:19,266
We disappear and I'll tell you
the rest of the plan on the train.

334
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:01,400
-Listen.
-Yes?

335
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:03,333
Any plans on coming back here?

336
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:06,333
Are you crazy?
Why would we come back?

337
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:08,166
Some unfinished business.

338
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:11,166
Bablu, stop.

339
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,166
Who is it?

340
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:17,433
-You baldy!
-Darn it!

341
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:21,133
-Take this.
-Save me!

342
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,766
Move quickly!

343
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:32,066
Who hit me?

344
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,300
I won't spare you.
Who are you?

345
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:10,033
A drop of satiety's enough
To set my heart on fire

346
00:24:10,466 --> 00:24:16,133
I missed you every moment

347
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:22,566
Somebody fulfilled
My shattered hopes

348
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:28,766
We met but you soon went away

349
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:34,766
Without you, life seems dull

350
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:40,333
Life seems dull

351
00:24:40,466 --> 00:24:45,733
Without you
Without you

352
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:52,033
Without you
Without you

353
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:58,200
Without you
Without you

354
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:04,500
Hurry! The train is here.

355
00:25:04,766 --> 00:25:06,400
-Where is Bablu?
-I don't know.

356
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:07,533
-He was right behind me.
-Bablu!

357
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:09,300
-Where is Bablu?
-Bablu!

358
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:10,700
The train is leaving!

359
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:12,200
Someone stop it!

360
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,766
-Come on, Bablu!
-The train is leaving!

361
00:25:15,066 --> 00:25:16,633
-Bablu!
-Bablu!

362
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:18,600
The train has left!

363
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:20,566
Bablu, the train is leaving.

364
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:22,800
-What is he doing?
-Oh, no!

365
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,800
Bablu! Bablu, come here!

366
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,266
-Bablu, hurry!
-The train....

367
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,700
-The train is leaving!
-Bablu!

368
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,300
-Bablu!
-Bablu, hurry!

369
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:33,266
-Hurry up! We'll miss the train.
-Please hurry!

370
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,500
Come on! Hurry up!

371
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,433
Oh, no! Gosh!

372
00:25:57,766 --> 00:25:59,366
Get in the line.

373
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:03,566
Bhuppi, these are the fools
that escaped.

374
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,600
Fatso.

375
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,433
Scoundrel.

376
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,533
You....

377
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,633
Don't you dare touch anyone!

378
00:26:18,366 --> 00:26:19,733
So you're the hero.

379
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,400
I'll burn you in the furnace.

380
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,300
No one will know
where you disappeared.

381
00:26:26,433 --> 00:26:27,433
Rajjo, enough!

382
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:40,633
You're a big-time ruffian,
aren't you?

383
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,466
You were supposed to
watch over them, weren't you?

384
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,500
Am I right?
How did they escape?

385
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:50,633
These boys will die
sooner or later.

386
00:26:50,766 --> 00:26:52,566
But I might end up killing you.

387
00:26:53,366 --> 00:26:54,466
Darn it.

388
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:03,166
Don't ever think
of running away again.

389
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,700
Don't worry.

390
00:27:06,766 --> 00:27:11,433
We won't leave
till you find the girl.

391
00:27:13,433 --> 00:27:14,600
He has an attitude.

392
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:18,166
Let's see.

393
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,433
Enough of your big attitude.

394
00:27:22,566 --> 00:27:24,433
Why did you stop?

395
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,666
I didn't stop. She stopped me.

396
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,666
-Who?
-That girl.

397
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:32,766
She lives in this village.

398
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:37,333
Bablu, this is the Jat Land.

399
00:27:37,466 --> 00:27:39,700
It's forbidden to even think about
their girls.

400
00:27:40,266 --> 00:27:42,566
I can find you one
if you come to London.

401
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,666
Now that I've met her...

402
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:47,433
...I don't need to meet
anyone else.

403
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,033
Have you lost your mind?

404
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:52,100
Maybe.

405
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,500
I don't know.

406
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:58,533
It feels like
everything has stopped.

407
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,766
You mean constipation?

408
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,300
-Will you shut up?
-Okay, okay. I'll shut up.

409
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,233
But what is the position now?

410
00:28:06,366 --> 00:28:09,500
First, we must find out
who the girl is.

411
00:28:16,566 --> 00:28:17,600
No.

412
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,000
This news shouldn't be out
in the newspapers.

413
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:22,100
Bless you, dear.

414
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,600
May you be successful
in your efforts today.

415
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:27,333
The teacher has relatives, right?

416
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:29,466
Keep an eye on them. Wait.

417
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,466
There was a shootout!

418
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,333
A few died on the spot.

419
00:28:35,566 --> 00:28:37,100
It was fun.

420
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,000
Where is Daddy's
dearest girl going?

421
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:42,133
College.

422
00:28:42,266 --> 00:28:43,733
To submit
my home science project.

423
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:48,000
Your sister submitted many
such home science projects.

424
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:49,333
Aren't you ashamed?

425
00:28:49,466 --> 00:28:51,100
Your sister ran away
and you're going to college.

426
00:28:51,233 --> 00:28:53,200
What nonsense!
Renu's the one who ran away.

427
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:54,366
Shut up!

428
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,466
Wild one. Go inside.
And no more college.

429
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,733
-Home science.
-No college....

430
00:29:00,033 --> 00:29:01,200
Renu ran away and they stop me
from going to college.

431
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,500
Dimpy.

432
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:06,000
Listen to me.
Stop going to college.

433
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,133
Learn cooking.

434
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:11,200
Brother Rajjo,
don't you have a home?

435
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,200
-You always hang around here.
-Listen....

436
00:29:15,233 --> 00:29:16,366
Don't call me brother.

437
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,566
Soon we'll be related
in a different way.

438
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,100
How's that?
Are you making me your mother?

439
00:29:21,233 --> 00:29:23,133
I will make you
mother of my kids.

440
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:45,766
Dad, they stopped me
from going to college.

441
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:48,133
Everyone suspects...

442
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,066
...that I will run away like Renu.

443
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,633
No, my dear.

444
00:29:52,233 --> 00:29:53,533
I trust you.

445
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:56,300
Renu wouldn't have eloped.

446
00:29:57,433 --> 00:29:59,400
That boy misled her.

447
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,700
He seduced her.

448
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,500
How can my daughter elope?

449
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:07,466
Do you remember?

450
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,100
As little girls...

451
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:11,333
...both of you used to play
with my mustache.

452
00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:15,066
I'd trim my mustache down...

453
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,033
...and you'd turn it up.

454
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:22,133
You couldn't stand to see
your father's mustache down.

455
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:25,766
I wish...

456
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:29,200
...my daughter had not eloped.

457
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:35,166
Dad, I'll never do
what Renu did.

458
00:30:37,366 --> 00:30:38,766
Do you trust me?

459
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:43,766
So please let me
go to college.

460
00:30:44,066 --> 00:30:45,400
What?

461
00:30:48,466 --> 00:30:50,600
-Let's talk later.
-Dad, please....

462
00:30:54,366 --> 00:30:55,533
Okay, Dad.

463
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,233
Go.

464
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,566
Yes, you were saying something.

465
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,600
Our custom says those
who indulge in love marriage...

466
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:08,266
...will be killed
by their own family.

467
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,633
My daughter didn't run away!
She was misled.

468
00:31:15,766 --> 00:31:19,366
And if she has eloped willingly...

469
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:23,433
...I'll burn her alive.

470
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:27,633
You don't help me.

471
00:31:27,766 --> 00:31:29,766
My uncles and aunts...

472
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,600
...had their fun
when it was their time.

473
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:33,600
But when it's my time,
they declared an emergency.

474
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:34,733
-Why?
-Why?

475
00:31:35,033 --> 00:31:37,500
Don't you have fun secretly?

476
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,200
What do I do?
I just lie to go to college.

477
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,166
I don't lie
to go around with boys.

478
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,166
Exactly. Don't you want to?

479
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,666
I don't have time
for such nonsense.

480
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:53,300
I have two years for myself.
To enjoy my freedom.

481
00:31:53,433 --> 00:31:55,600
I have to finish my education
and learn dancing.

482
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:57,333
I want to become Miss Haryana...

483
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:00,600
...and then marry
whoever my dad chooses...

484
00:32:00,733 --> 00:32:02,266
...and have a kid every year.

485
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:04,766
If I stop going to college...

486
00:32:05,066 --> 00:32:07,233
...my two-year plan will be ruined.

487
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:09,200
I hope Renu gets caught...

488
00:32:09,533 --> 00:32:12,133
...and her husband leaves her
on the night of their honeymoon.

489
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:13,700
I hope she comes back crying.

490
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,066
She is a witch.

491
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,600
She ran away
and left me in a coop.

492
00:32:17,733 --> 00:32:19,200
I can't go to college.

493
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,766
You can go to college
only after Renu is caught.

494
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:25,300
Those boys know where Renu is
and they will never tell us.

495
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,766
Of course, they will.
I'll deal with them.

496
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,333
So, what is the position?

497
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:42,000
Good.

498
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:43,733
There are just 300 houses
in the village.

499
00:32:44,033 --> 00:32:45,233
Finding the girl
won't be difficult.

500
00:32:45,366 --> 00:32:47,500
There's a crematorium as well.

501
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,033
Your cremation won't be difficult.

502
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:51,266
Excuse me.
Hello, listen.

503
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,500
-English in Jat Land?
-Excuse me.

504
00:32:54,066 --> 00:32:55,100
A girl?

505
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,733
Although I never entertain boys...

506
00:32:58,033 --> 00:32:59,300
...now I have no option.

507
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:01,766
Just tell me where my sister is.

508
00:33:07,066 --> 00:33:08,600
I'm not talking
to your thin waist.

509
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:13,000
-Show me your face.
-You....

510
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:17,400
Please tell me.

511
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,300
I won't tell anyone. Honestly!

512
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:22,100
Okay, listen.

513
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,400
Yes? Tell me.

514
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:24,700
Your sister....

515
00:33:25,366 --> 00:33:26,366
Okay.

516
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,633
And her boyfriend.

517
00:33:27,766 --> 00:33:28,766
Okay.

518
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,766
The place
they are hiding is....

519
00:33:33,766 --> 00:33:35,466
-We don't know.
-Gosh.

520
00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:41,800
-You think you're a hero?
-I don't say that, but they do.

521
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,733
I can't stop everyone
from talking.

522
00:33:44,033 --> 00:33:46,233
My entire family is in trouble
because of you.

523
00:33:46,366 --> 00:33:48,733
Not because of me,
blame your father.

524
00:33:49,033 --> 00:33:51,366
Don't you dare insult my father.

525
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,800
There isn't
a better man than him.

526
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,266
I see.

527
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,300
Why did your sister leave him?

528
00:33:58,233 --> 00:34:00,100
Even if I tell you...

529
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:02,700
...you know what will happen
to them when they are caught.

530
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,533
So?

531
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:07,366
They ruined the family name,
so they'll be punished.

532
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,366
If they are wrong,
then who's right?

533
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,166
Me and my dad.

534
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,366
There's one more.

535
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,300
-Who?
-Me.

536
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,066
Then we should help each other.

537
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,433
I mean, both of us
are in trouble because of Renu.

538
00:34:23,566 --> 00:34:24,700
Right?

539
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,166
-Then do one thing.
-Hold on. Please.

540
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,333
-Let me speak to her.
-Let him speak.

541
00:34:32,466 --> 00:34:35,533
-Let's help each other. Tell me.
-Bablu.

542
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,633
Okay, I'll find your sister.

543
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:40,200
Okay.

544
00:34:40,433 --> 00:34:43,266
-And you find that girl.
-Girl? Which girl?

545
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,733
He's in love with a girl
from your village.

546
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:47,066
Love?

547
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:49,166
Not yet.

548
00:34:49,766 --> 00:34:52,333
But it could be true.
Who knows?

549
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,433
How dare you!

550
00:34:54,566 --> 00:34:57,266
You want other families to be
ruined like ours.

551
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,300
Their families will even stop girls
from attending college.

552
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:00,500
-She is a radio.
-You're done for!

553
00:35:00,633 --> 00:35:02,266
-You're a goner. I'll tell my dad.
-Fine.

554
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
-Go away.
-We'll deal with you.

555
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:04,600
-Stop!
-Hey, she is going.

556
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:06,733
It's not true.
You'll get us killed.

557
00:35:07,033 --> 00:35:09,333
Paste this photo
on your chest

558
00:35:09,466 --> 00:35:12,033
He's been here for just two days,
and already in love.

559
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:13,766
And look at his audacity.

560
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,566
He's asking for my help.

561
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,600
I felt like kicking him.

562
00:35:21,033 --> 00:35:22,466
What are you doing?
Why did you fall on me?

563
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,700
-You kicked me.
-What's this?

564
00:35:28,233 --> 00:35:30,466
-"My love, Renu."
-Love letter?

565
00:35:33,266 --> 00:35:35,300
"My lips found yours...."

566
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:36,533
"Kiss."

567
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:38,700
"Love."

568
00:35:40,266 --> 00:35:41,666
"Two bodies, one soul!"

569
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,000
Oh, my!

570
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:44,533
"Yours, Rakesh!"

571
00:35:46,366 --> 00:35:48,300
Why did she hide it here?

572
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:51,200
Gather this quickly.
Someone might walk in.

573
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:53,600
Switch off the fan.
They're scattering everywhere.

574
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,333
Darn it.

575
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:09,233
Oh, no! We're done for!

576
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:13,433
This is serious.
Uncle Bhuppi found the letter.

577
00:36:13,566 --> 00:36:14,700
Hide them!

578
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,333
They even kissed each other.

579
00:36:19,466 --> 00:36:21,533
"Touch me! Touch me! Touch me!"

580
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:23,133
"Kiss me!"

581
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:25,466
Now isn't the time to enjoy them.
Hide them quickly.

582
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:28,066
Quickly.

583
00:36:32,466 --> 00:36:33,500
What are you doing?

584
00:36:34,633 --> 00:36:35,633
Where's Dimpy?

585
00:36:35,766 --> 00:36:38,166
She must be in her room.
Why? What happened?

586
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:40,300
Here. Throw them away.

587
00:36:40,433 --> 00:36:42,200
No. Burn them. Burn them.

588
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,700
-Who, me?
-No, me. Go quickly.

589
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:48,333
-Dimpy.
-Oh, no.

590
00:36:48,466 --> 00:36:49,666
What's this?

591
00:36:50,566 --> 00:36:52,666
-What?
-Your sister's love letter.

592
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,533
I see.

593
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:57,133
So that's how they look.
I never saw one.

594
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:08,333
Wait.

595
00:37:12,066 --> 00:37:13,266
What's in that?

596
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,733
Nothing.

597
00:37:16,266 --> 00:37:17,633
-Tenne.
-Sir.

598
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:21,400
-Check what's in the basket.
-Okay, sir.

599
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:39,500
What's in the basket?

600
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:41,500
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

601
00:37:44,433 --> 00:37:46,166
It's nothing, just rubbish.

602
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,300
If I find out someone else
was involved...

603
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:51,466
...I'll shoot them.

604
00:37:56,133 --> 00:37:57,266
This is amazing.

605
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,133
Love letters in the age
of mobile phones.

606
00:37:59,266 --> 00:38:01,000
-How romantic!
-Show us.

607
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:04,100
Did you see that?
Rakesh was really desperate.

608
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,566
-Time to show off!
-Forget it.

609
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,166
Kiki, we can get out of here.
See these letters?

610
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,566
Watch how I act.

611
00:38:15,066 --> 00:38:17,066
Call Suraj Singh Chaudhary.

612
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,200
Quiet!

613
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:21,666
Call your father.

614
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,066
These letters clearly indicate...

615
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:29,433
...that you played a role
in your sister's love story.

616
00:38:29,566 --> 00:38:31,133
Now we'll teach you a lesson.

617
00:38:31,266 --> 00:38:33,366
We'll tell you....

618
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,100
You will do
whatever we say.

619
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,366
-Listen to me. Please--
-We don't want to see all that.

620
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:43,333
God!

621
00:38:43,466 --> 00:38:44,466
Look....

622
00:38:44,766 --> 00:38:47,100
Don't try to blackmail me.

623
00:38:47,433 --> 00:38:49,033
I haven't thought about it yet...

624
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,533
...but I'll blackmail you now.

625
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,166
But I had no clue
about Renu's affair.

626
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,433
But it's clearly written
in these letters...

627
00:38:58,566 --> 00:39:01,200
...that you watched
English movies with them.

628
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:04,066
Sometimes.

629
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,466
You were given your sister's
pocket money to keep quiet.

630
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,500
Sometimes.

631
00:39:11,633 --> 00:39:13,166
But I didn't know
she would run away.

632
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,300
I see.

633
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:16,600
Honestly, I didn't know.

634
00:39:16,733 --> 00:39:18,333
So you're saying...

635
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:20,400
...that falling in love is right...

636
00:39:20,766 --> 00:39:22,566
...but love marriage is a sin.

637
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,000
I get it now.

638
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:32,100
Whatever tarnishes family honor
is a sin. Idiot!

639
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:34,000
So why did you help Renu
run away?

640
00:39:36,033 --> 00:39:37,133
That's not in the letters.

641
00:39:37,266 --> 00:39:38,566
That's not in the letters.

642
00:39:39,366 --> 00:39:41,666
But what if I write it?

643
00:39:42,233 --> 00:39:43,233
What nonsense!

644
00:39:43,366 --> 00:39:45,033
God! You're such a rascal!

645
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:46,633
Liar, blackmailer!

646
00:39:46,766 --> 00:39:48,433
But it's true...

647
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:52,266
...that you got a secret tattoo
on your body.

648
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,100
You also took modeling classes...

649
00:39:56,466 --> 00:39:58,533
...to become Miss Haryana.

650
00:39:58,766 --> 00:40:01,533
You also took salsa classes.

651
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,433
You were saying something?

652
00:40:03,566 --> 00:40:05,333
Girl, village....

653
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:08,266
Can't we make a deal?

654
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:12,733
-What's the offer?
-Wait. Write it down.

655
00:40:13,033 --> 00:40:14,333
I want a mirror.
I haven't taken a bath.

656
00:40:14,466 --> 00:40:15,633
My face is ruined.
I have an audition tomorrow.

657
00:40:15,766 --> 00:40:17,033
And I want a laptop
with Internet connection.

658
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,166
And--

659
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,066
-Three pairs of shorts.
-Shorts?

660
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,366
Ask for food.
Who cares about shorts?

661
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
Get some food
for this hungry dog.

662
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:23,700
Do we have Dominos over here?

663
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,166
And-- Do we--
Do we get to eat something?

664
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,533
And please give me my passport.
Please--

665
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:30,300
-Please get us free quickly.
-It stinks in here.

666
00:40:30,433 --> 00:40:32,166
-Wait, one second.
-It stinks in here.

667
00:40:33,233 --> 00:40:34,800
-Listen, girl.
-Yes?

668
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,366
Think of a scheme...

669
00:40:36,766 --> 00:40:38,766
...so that I get to see the face
of every girl in this village.

670
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,133
What's this nonsense?

671
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:44,400
I mean, I have no experience
in such cases.

672
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:45,733
-Now you will.
-He'll get us killed.

673
00:40:46,066 --> 00:40:47,433
If Dad finds out,
he'll kill me.

674
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:50,566
Forget your dad
and think about me.

675
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,600
Think about the one I love.

676
00:40:56,633 --> 00:40:58,100
By the way...

677
00:40:58,466 --> 00:41:00,666
...what does she look like?

678
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,033
Her little brown eyes

679
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:44,366
Her kohl-lined eyes

680
00:41:49,433 --> 00:41:53,566
Her little brown eyes

681
00:41:54,066 --> 00:41:56,766
Her kohl-lined eyes

682
00:41:57,566 --> 00:42:04,533
When she smiles
I smile with her

683
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:11,033
I want to savor her
And I want to save her

684
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:15,566
From the evil eyes of this world

685
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:21,033
Oh, God
I plead to you

686
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:25,366
Show me a glimpse of her

687
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:31,766
Oh, God
I plead to you

688
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:36,700
I'll give up my life
For one glimpse of her

689
00:43:07,566 --> 00:43:12,466
My friends
I don't know what's wrong with me

690
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:18,233
I am in and out of my senses
In a flash

691
00:43:18,533 --> 00:43:23,300
I roam around
Lost and senseless

692
00:43:23,433 --> 00:43:29,400
Please make me
Make sense of myself

693
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:34,766
My life has been
Meaningless so far

694
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:42,200
I've found a reason to live

695
00:43:59,066 --> 00:44:03,766
I don't fall in love easily

696
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,300
Nothing can make my heart
Race so easily

697
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:14,733
Your eyes twinkle like stars

698
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:20,400
And you're like the moon
Who rises only at night

699
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:26,266
I want to burn and feel cold
At the same time

700
00:44:26,566 --> 00:44:31,633
Under your burning gaze

701
00:44:31,766 --> 00:44:36,466
Oh, God
I plead to you

702
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:41,200
Show me a glimpse of her

703
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,366
Oh, God
I plead to you

704
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:53,033
I'll give up my life
For one glimpse of her

705
00:45:09,033 --> 00:45:11,466
Idiot, you make fun of my acting.
Why don't you try?

706
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,166
Okay, I won't. Stop hamming it up.

707
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,500
-What are you doing?
-Please.

708
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:17,733
Guys....

709
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,600
Choose one.

710
00:45:19,733 --> 00:45:22,100
-I won't.
-Come on, please do it.

711
00:45:22,566 --> 00:45:23,566
May I?

712
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,033
Okay. This one.

713
00:45:25,166 --> 00:45:26,533
But what is the position?

714
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,733
-I am going.
-Where?

715
00:45:30,433 --> 00:45:31,533
Chaudhary's house.

716
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:33,566
-Why didn't I think of it before?
-Listen.

717
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,000
Hold on.

718
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,133
What if we had chosen
the other one?

719
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,133
Then I would've talked
to Chaudhary directly.

720
00:45:42,566 --> 00:45:43,566
You're crazy.

721
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,266
Why do you want to get us
in trouble all the time?

722
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,766
Let me tell you since
you're so desperate to hear.

723
00:45:48,733 --> 00:45:49,733
I...

724
00:45:51,133 --> 00:45:52,400
...love....

725
00:45:54,233 --> 00:45:55,300
I love what?

726
00:45:56,766 --> 00:45:57,800
I'm not in the mood.

727
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,300
Without Dimpy's love
Rajjo is sad

728
00:46:01,433 --> 00:46:02,500
Shut up!

729
00:46:02,666 --> 00:46:06,133
Dimpy was only in 5th grade
when I decided to marry her.

730
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,000
If her sister hadn't eloped...

731
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:10,400
...we would've been
enjoying our honeymoon.

732
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:11,633
I would be kissing her.

733
00:46:11,766 --> 00:46:15,400
Mr. Chaudhary
has given his word.

734
00:46:15,533 --> 00:46:17,166
What will I do with his promise?

735
00:46:25,766 --> 00:46:27,233
Oh, God!

736
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,200
-Are we having a power outage?
-You're drunk, brother-in-law.

737
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:32,200
-Tenne.
-Sir, let me check.

738
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,500
-Are you done?
-Yes, sir.

739
00:47:03,466 --> 00:47:04,766
The TV's switched off.

740
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:06,566
It was a nice song.

741
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:11,500
Without Dimpy's love
Rajjo is sad

742
00:47:12,133 --> 00:47:17,766
Mr. Chaudhary
Doesn't listen to my pleas

743
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,366
-Where's the bottle?
-It's next to the glass.

744
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,400
Where's the bottle?

745
00:47:25,766 --> 00:47:26,766
Empty.

746
00:47:27,066 --> 00:47:28,700
The glass is empty.

747
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Forget it.

748
00:47:30,133 --> 00:47:32,600
Here. Have some cheese fritters.

749
00:47:33,566 --> 00:47:35,466
Give me the fries.

750
00:47:36,466 --> 00:47:38,500
Brother-in-law,
you're trying to fool me.

751
00:47:38,633 --> 00:47:40,300
What are you saying?
There were some fritters left.

752
00:47:40,433 --> 00:47:41,433
Right.

753
00:47:41,566 --> 00:47:44,066
-Who said that?
-I did. What are you gonna do?

754
00:47:45,566 --> 00:47:47,000
You slapped me.

755
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:50,733
Don't spit on me, man. Look
the other way when you talk.

756
00:47:51,033 --> 00:47:53,166
-Nobody respects you.
-Go home.

757
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,300
-Brother-in-law, I'll teach you a lesson.
-Forget it.

758
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,533
Dear me

759
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,500
Baby

760
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,100
Hey.

761
00:48:25,233 --> 00:48:26,500
Listen up, girl.

762
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:32,600
You didn't find that girl,
did you?

763
00:48:35,066 --> 00:48:37,166
You're good for nothing.

764
00:48:37,566 --> 00:48:38,700
I swear...

765
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,000
...I'll tell your father...

766
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:44,266
...that you had a role
in Renu's love story.

767
00:48:45,366 --> 00:48:46,633
Now get up.

768
00:48:47,533 --> 00:48:50,400
She couldn't even
find a girl.

769
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:59,333
-What are you doing here? Are you crazy?
-Who is it?

770
00:48:59,466 --> 00:49:01,200
We had a power outage
at the wrong time.

771
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:03,033
Hey, Ms. Slim Waist.

772
00:49:04,533 --> 00:49:05,633
Who was that?

773
00:49:05,766 --> 00:49:07,600
You fool, that was Shalu.

774
00:49:07,733 --> 00:49:09,366
Oh, yes.

775
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:13,200
Wait here.
Let me apologize to her.

776
00:49:13,433 --> 00:49:15,500
What are you doing?
It's so dark in here.

777
00:49:15,633 --> 00:49:17,533
You'll get us both killed.

778
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,166
Where are you?

779
00:49:22,533 --> 00:49:25,133
You're drunk.

780
00:49:25,266 --> 00:49:26,300
Maybe.

781
00:49:26,433 --> 00:49:28,500
-Maybe? Where did you get it?
-It's fine. Come downstairs.

782
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:30,233
I'm coming.

783
00:49:30,566 --> 00:49:32,000
Stay here.

784
00:49:32,133 --> 00:49:33,133
-Don't move.
-Okay.

785
00:49:33,266 --> 00:49:35,066
I'll be right back. Don't move.

786
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,533
I can't even see his face.

787
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:39,500
There's a power outage.
Did someone call the helpline?

788
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,300
We're the only ones having
a power outage in the entire village.

789
00:49:42,433 --> 00:49:44,466
Sukhi, go check the meter.

790
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Where did he go?

791
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:53,033
The water is chilly

792
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,133
What the...?

793
00:49:55,266 --> 00:49:58,166
And the day is sunny

794
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,400
Shameless.

795
00:49:59,533 --> 00:50:01,766
Come to the beach
And take my picture

796
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,700
Naked fellow, stop singing.

797
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:05,766
-I see.
-Gosh.

798
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,266
Sorry.

799
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,633
Did you come here
to take a bath?

800
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:14,133
I've been locked up in
that coop for so many days.

801
00:50:15,466 --> 00:50:17,633
What if I find that
girl tomorrow?

802
00:50:17,766 --> 00:50:19,233
He and his darn girl.

803
00:50:19,366 --> 00:50:21,033
She won't like me.

804
00:50:21,166 --> 00:50:22,333
Yeah, right.

805
00:50:23,466 --> 00:50:26,400
What if she wants to take me
into her arms?

806
00:50:32,633 --> 00:50:36,066
But you haven't found her yet,
you good-for-nothing.

807
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,733
Darn you.

808
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,266
It hurts.

809
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,733
Get away from here.

810
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,466
You'll get us killed.

811
00:50:45,666 --> 00:50:46,733
-Here.
-What are you doing?

812
00:50:47,033 --> 00:50:49,100
Here's something
that belongs to her.

813
00:50:49,233 --> 00:50:51,800
-Find her in 24 hours.
-Fine, leave.

814
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,766
Or else I'll tell your father.

815
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,500
I know. Now, go
or we'll be in trouble.

816
00:50:56,633 --> 00:50:58,133
I am going.

817
00:50:58,266 --> 00:51:00,466
I don't know about her beauty,
but her figure is good.

818
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,300
Stupid fool.

819
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,533
Listen.

820
00:51:20,233 --> 00:51:22,333
Put a lantern in Dimpy's room.

821
00:51:25,533 --> 00:51:27,566
Sukhi. He was here.

822
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:30,400
-Who?
-That Bablu.

823
00:51:30,533 --> 00:51:31,533
-Bablu?
-Yes.

824
00:51:31,666 --> 00:51:33,233
He hit me again.

825
00:51:33,366 --> 00:51:35,566
How? Like this?

826
00:51:36,533 --> 00:51:38,100
The boys are locked up
in the shed.

827
00:51:38,233 --> 00:51:39,333
You have been drinking too much.

828
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:46,233
Please, Lord,
help that crazy boy find the girl...

829
00:51:47,033 --> 00:51:48,266
...and spare me.

830
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,633
Please. Please.
Please do it for me.

831
00:52:42,366 --> 00:52:44,766
Take those guys out.

832
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:47,000
Throw them in the car.

833
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:48,266
Hurry.

834
00:53:07,266 --> 00:53:08,533
Where are you taking us?

835
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:11,133
We're taking you to witness
your friend's death.

836
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,033
He had a knack
for eloping with girls.

837
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:15,533
How did you find out where he is?

838
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:17,600
The rascal called his mother.

839
00:53:18,233 --> 00:53:19,666
He's hiding in Mohali.

840
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,300
Where will he run now?

841
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,400
Come on, move.

842
00:53:37,066 --> 00:53:39,766
-Where are they?
-C Wing, 12th floor.

843
00:53:42,466 --> 00:53:43,700
-Tenne.
-Yes, sir.

844
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,666
-Keep an eye on the boys.
-Sir.

845
00:53:52,133 --> 00:53:54,533
Bro, I need to pee.

846
00:54:01,766 --> 00:54:03,633
-What happened?
-Where did he go?

847
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:30,333
Forget it.
Let's take the stairs.

848
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,200
What are you doing?

849
00:54:43,066 --> 00:54:44,600
-Where are you going?
-Who is he?

850
00:54:53,033 --> 00:54:54,100
-Hey!
-Get down!

851
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,066
Bablu, what are you doing here?

852
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,066
I couldn't take the front door.

853
00:55:21,133 --> 00:55:23,366
-Where's Rakesh?
-What's going on?

854
00:55:24,266 --> 00:55:26,300
-Bablu?
-Bablu? What are you doing here?

855
00:55:26,433 --> 00:55:28,000
We had a plan.

856
00:55:28,133 --> 00:55:29,266
Why did you switch off
your phone at the last moment?

857
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,500
I didn't switch it off.

858
00:55:30,633 --> 00:55:32,133
The guys from her family
broke it.

859
00:55:32,266 --> 00:55:33,333
My family?

860
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,800
Sir, this side.

861
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,633
After you fled,
all of us were abducted.

862
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:40,700
Why did you call your mom?

863
00:55:41,233 --> 00:55:43,300
Her family found out.
Reception committee's outside.

864
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,266
Open the door.

865
00:55:47,566 --> 00:55:49,433
Open the door
or we'll break it open.

866
00:55:49,566 --> 00:55:50,700
Renu, come on.

867
00:55:51,566 --> 00:55:53,733
-Renu, come on.
-Renu, open the door.

868
00:55:54,066 --> 00:55:55,566
You should go.
I will handle them.

869
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,166
-Bablu.
-Bablu, what are you doing?

870
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:00,433
You will fall down.

871
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,500
Bablu.

872
00:56:06,766 --> 00:56:08,333
-Renu, careful.
-I will fall down.

873
00:56:08,466 --> 00:56:10,533
Renu!
-Careful!

874
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,266
-Yes?
-Bablu!

875
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,500
-Go away!
-Who are you?

876
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,300
Pull her up.

877
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,766
Bablu!

878
00:56:26,033 --> 00:56:27,433
Sir, this way.

879
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,733
Rajjo, search the balcony.

880
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,500
Where are they?

881
00:56:44,066 --> 00:56:46,100
-I think they went to Goa.
-Quiet!

882
00:56:52,466 --> 00:56:53,766
Come on, Renu, move.

883
00:56:55,133 --> 00:56:56,366
Yes, sir?

884
00:56:57,633 --> 00:56:59,033
Come on!

885
00:57:06,133 --> 00:57:07,133
Stop! Stop!

886
00:57:07,266 --> 00:57:08,266
Come on.

887
00:57:08,766 --> 00:57:10,600
-Come on.
-Give me your hand.

888
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,300
Don't worry.
No need to be scared.

889
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:17,666
Just don't give up.
You two aren't wrong.

890
00:57:20,033 --> 00:57:22,066
And yes....

891
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,133
Keep this.

892
00:57:25,666 --> 00:57:26,766
Don't worry.

893
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,433
I'm here. I'll handle everything.

894
00:57:28,566 --> 00:57:29,766
-Okay?
-Thanks, Bablu.

895
00:57:31,066 --> 00:57:32,233
Listen....

896
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:34,200
Tell me something.

897
00:57:35,733 --> 00:57:37,200
Are you two happy?

898
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,600
Yes.

899
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,166
Okay. No need to be scared.

900
00:57:42,533 --> 00:57:46,033
I'll handle everything.
Okay? Don't give up!

901
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:48,466
Listen. Take care!

902
00:57:49,266 --> 00:57:50,433
Take care.

903
00:57:52,033 --> 00:57:53,433
He ran away.
He ran away.

904
00:57:53,566 --> 00:57:55,300
-Sir, he ran away.
-I know.

905
00:57:55,433 --> 00:57:58,066
-Why are you screaming?
-You know Bablu ran away?

906
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:09,533
Found an earring

907
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:11,000
Find those love letters.

908
00:58:11,133 --> 00:58:13,000
Everyone is puzzled

909
00:58:13,133 --> 00:58:15,200
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

910
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:18,066
By God, what a love story!

911
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,766
Have you seen him?

912
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,766
How does he look?
Is he handsome?

913
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,066
I am not interested.

914
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,400
And anyway, he's the same guy
who has made my dad's life hell.

915
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,333
Come on. Move it!

916
00:58:43,666 --> 00:58:45,066
Lock them up.

917
00:58:48,133 --> 00:58:49,366
-Shalu.
-Yes.

918
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,600
What are you doing here?

919
00:58:50,733 --> 00:58:53,766
Nothing. Just cleaning up.
The place is so dirty.

920
00:58:55,366 --> 00:58:57,433
No need. Get lost.

921
00:58:58,566 --> 00:59:00,566
-Get out!
-Sure.

922
00:59:08,766 --> 00:59:10,133
-Get in.
-Go on.

923
00:59:10,266 --> 00:59:11,400
Bolt the door!

924
00:59:13,033 --> 00:59:15,700
-Bablu, you cheat!
-Forget it.

925
00:59:16,066 --> 00:59:18,700
You knew where Rakesh and Renu were
all this time!

926
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,333
You knew when they'd elope
and about their hideout.

927
00:59:20,466 --> 00:59:22,133
You knew everything.
Why didn't you tell us?

928
00:59:22,266 --> 00:59:23,566
Why should I?

929
00:59:25,533 --> 00:59:29,433
You ratted on your friends
when they slapped you twice.

930
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:32,133
Another blow...

931
00:59:33,133 --> 00:59:35,333
...and you would've told them
about Rakesh and Renu.

932
00:59:35,633 --> 00:59:37,466
But, Bablu, try to understand.

933
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,633
That girl has a family.
They must be worried.

934
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,733
I don't care about them.

935
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,100
Rakesh is our friend, that's it.
I want to see him happy.

936
00:59:47,233 --> 00:59:49,166
I'm not a hero like you are.

937
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,166
-We're your friends too.
-I know.

938
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,033
And when the time comes...

939
00:59:53,166 --> 00:59:57,166
...I'll help you guys
like I helped Rakesh.

940
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:00,033
Bablu, that's not what we meant.
Try to understand.

941
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:04,000
Idiots, people would swear
by our friendship.

942
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:07,400
If you can help us all
escape from here...

943
01:00:07,533 --> 01:00:10,533
...why are you risking
our lives for that girl?

944
01:00:10,766 --> 01:00:12,500
Do you want to die for her?

945
01:00:16,166 --> 01:00:17,400
I haven't thought about it yet.

946
01:00:20,566 --> 01:00:22,400
You have gone crazy
over that girl.

947
01:00:23,133 --> 01:00:24,366
Someone please explain to him.

948
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,466
Are you so crazy for that girl
that you don't care about us?

949
01:00:32,166 --> 01:00:33,300
He has gone crazy.

950
01:00:45,233 --> 01:00:47,366
You'll get killed
and you'll drag us down with you.

951
01:00:50,266 --> 01:00:51,266
That girl....

952
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,066
-She heard everything.
-Really?

953
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,000
-Who was she?
-Oh, no.

954
01:00:55,133 --> 01:00:57,266
-Where is she?
-Stop her.

955
01:01:01,633 --> 01:01:04,333
You're amazing.
You got all the letters.

956
01:01:05,433 --> 01:01:07,166
Actually, that boy is amazing.

957
01:01:08,133 --> 01:01:10,266
He's been helping
Renu and Rakesh.

958
01:01:12,033 --> 01:01:14,166
He's been helping them
all along.

959
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,066
He knew when they'd elope
and where they'd go...

960
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,100
...and he also knew
their address.

961
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,533
He knew.

962
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:28,600
Who is he?

963
01:01:32,033 --> 01:01:34,233
-I don't know.
-Who is he?

964
01:01:34,533 --> 01:01:36,300
I don't know, Uncle.

965
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,766
Didn't you hear me?
Who is he?

966
01:01:39,533 --> 01:01:41,100
I don't know, Uncle.

967
01:01:41,366 --> 01:01:44,033
Get those boys out!
Come on!

968
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,166
-Come on! Tell us.
-Uncle!

969
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:59,733
-Who is he?
-I don't know.

970
01:02:00,066 --> 01:02:01,066
Speak up!

971
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,366
-Who among them is the guy?
-I really don't know.

972
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,000
-It hurts.
-What?

973
01:02:05,133 --> 01:02:07,566
So what if it hurts?
You only care about your pain.

974
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,633
Look! Look at your father!

975
01:02:10,333 --> 01:02:12,533
He raised both of you
with such love and care...

976
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:14,000
...only to be humiliated like this.

977
01:02:14,133 --> 01:02:15,633
I really don't know, Uncle.

978
01:02:15,766 --> 01:02:16,766
Tell us!

979
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:19,733
One of you knows
where Renu and Rakesh are!

980
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:22,066
Tell us where they are!

981
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,033
Who among you knows about them?

982
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,366
Speak up or I'll shoot
each one of you!

983
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,066
-No!
-Speak up. Who is it?

984
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,166
-Is it him?
-Speak up!

985
01:02:36,066 --> 01:02:37,633
-Get lost.
-Take him away!

986
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,500
-Look at him!
-Sir!

987
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,300
-Speak up!
-Sir, I don't know--

988
01:02:44,433 --> 01:02:45,500
I haven't done anything.
Please.

989
01:02:45,633 --> 01:02:47,333
-Speak up!
-Sir, forgive me. Let go of me!

990
01:02:47,466 --> 01:02:49,633
-I don't know, sir.
-Get lost.

991
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:53,766
Please trust me.
I don't know anything, sir.

992
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:56,200
Is he the one?

993
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,766
Speak up, Dimpy.

994
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:04,100
Look at him!

995
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,500
Is it him?

996
01:03:06,266 --> 01:03:07,366
It's not me, sir.

997
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,633
Is it him? Speak up!

998
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,300
We've been wandering around
all these days.

999
01:03:12,433 --> 01:03:14,433
We've been going crazy. Speak up!

1000
01:03:15,033 --> 01:03:16,133
Is it him?

1001
01:03:16,266 --> 01:03:18,466
I don't know, Uncle.
I really don't know.

1002
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,066
You know everything. Tell us!

1003
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,400
Speak up!

1004
01:04:13,633 --> 01:04:14,766
Come on!

1005
01:04:20,733 --> 01:04:21,733
Come on!

1006
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,766
Is he the one?
Is he the guy?

1007
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,533
Is he the guy?

1008
01:05:04,766 --> 01:05:06,433
Speak up, Dimpy!

1009
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,433
Where have you hidden those two?

1010
01:05:42,366 --> 01:05:43,500
Speak up.

1011
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:45,333
Speak up.

1012
01:05:48,166 --> 01:05:50,600
I swear, I'll skin you alive.

1013
01:05:55,366 --> 01:05:57,400
Where have you hidden those two?

1014
01:06:00,766 --> 01:06:02,133
Speak up!

1015
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,533
Hey.

1016
01:06:13,666 --> 01:06:15,433
Why did you stop?
I was having fun.

1017
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,100
He's so stubborn!

1018
01:06:19,033 --> 01:06:22,433
I'm still the same Suraj Singh
who murdered 18 people at night.

1019
01:06:23,333 --> 01:06:25,000
I'm helpless
because of my daughter.

1020
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:29,033
If she'd been home,
I'd have killed her by now.

1021
01:06:30,533 --> 01:06:33,433
Have you thought about
why she isn't at home?

1022
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,433
You're a good friend,
aren't you?

1023
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:40,700
How much more beating
can you take for your friend?

1024
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,666
How long can you beat me?

1025
01:06:47,066 --> 01:06:48,100
Kill him.

1026
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,133
Not him.

1027
01:06:54,533 --> 01:06:58,000
So you want to be friends!
Let's see....

1028
01:06:59,466 --> 01:07:02,300
-Beat them up!
-Bablu, tell them, buddy.

1029
01:07:02,433 --> 01:07:04,300
Bablu knows.
Bablu, tell them!

1030
01:07:04,433 --> 01:07:05,633
-Bablu, tell them!
-Get up!

1031
01:07:05,766 --> 01:07:07,400
Bablu, they will kill us.

1032
01:07:07,533 --> 01:07:09,133
Bablu, tell them, buddy.

1033
01:07:09,266 --> 01:07:10,266
Sorry, sir.

1034
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,100
Bablu, please, tell them, buddy!

1035
01:07:13,733 --> 01:07:15,300
Bablu, tell them!

1036
01:07:15,433 --> 01:07:16,566
Bablu!

1037
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:17,800
Speak up!

1038
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,366
They are in Delhi.

1039
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:24,633
Delhi. Delhi, sir.

1040
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:42,533
Life seems dull

1041
01:07:42,666 --> 01:07:48,133
Without you, without you

1042
01:07:48,766 --> 01:07:54,233
Without you, without you

1043
01:07:55,266 --> 01:07:56,633
Come on. Move it!

1044
01:07:56,766 --> 01:07:59,300
Move it!
Put them in the car.

1045
01:07:59,433 --> 01:08:00,600
-Tenne.
-Yes, sir.

1046
01:08:23,133 --> 01:08:26,466
Idiot, you had to fall in love
with Chaudhary's daughter?

1047
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,566
Please don't look.
Please don't look.

1048
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,066
Let him.

1049
01:08:30,366 --> 01:08:32,366
This love story's
going to end in two days anyway.

1050
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:33,733
Come on. Hurry!

1051
01:08:37,133 --> 01:08:38,133
Yes.

1052
01:08:38,566 --> 01:08:39,566
We are leaving now.

1053
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:40,700
Yes.

1054
01:08:41,066 --> 01:08:42,300
Start the car.

1055
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:44,500
Listen.

1056
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:49,500
Do you love someone?

1057
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:54,566
Tell me if you love someone.

1058
01:08:55,666 --> 01:08:57,566
Someone else will get beaten up
because of you.

1059
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,633
You are talking nonsense
in front of Mr. Chaudhary.

1060
01:09:03,133 --> 01:09:04,366
There's nothing wrong.

1061
01:09:05,466 --> 01:09:06,700
We're all going to Delhi.

1062
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,700
What if she elopes
behind our back?

1063
01:09:11,633 --> 01:09:13,333
History will repeat itself.

1064
01:09:15,766 --> 01:09:18,733
Be brave if you love someone.
Speak up.

1065
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,766
-Time to teach you a lesson.
-Rajjo.

1066
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,600
He is trying to instigate me.

1067
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:24,433
Put him in the car.

1068
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:26,500
Come on!

1069
01:09:43,133 --> 01:09:45,600
This hero attitude only looks good
on-screen.

1070
01:09:46,066 --> 01:09:47,600
In real life,
the villain always wins.

1071
01:09:48,233 --> 01:09:49,433
Understood?

1072
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,733
Stop the car.

1073
01:10:08,466 --> 01:10:09,566
Let's take Dimpy along.

1074
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:12,066
-Take Dimpy along?
-We'll take Dimpy along.

1075
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,166
Dimpy!

1076
01:10:21,266 --> 01:10:23,000
A hero wins, even in real life.

1077
01:10:54,066 --> 01:10:56,066
Now the love story begins.

1078
01:11:20,533 --> 01:11:22,566
Just whistle with me

1079
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,033
Everybody go

1080
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,066
Just whistle with me

1081
01:11:38,433 --> 01:11:39,433
Everybody go

1082
01:11:39,566 --> 01:11:44,400
Baby, come be my lady
Why do you make me crazy, beautiful?

1083
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:48,100
I love you every day
I'll hold your hand and take you away

1084
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:57,300
Baby, come be my lady
Why do you make me crazy, beautiful?

1085
01:11:57,433 --> 01:12:00,733
I love you every day
I'll hold your hand and take you away

1086
01:12:01,033 --> 01:12:05,033
I worry about the world
I won't let you hold my hands

1087
01:12:05,166 --> 01:12:09,066
I'm afraid you'll make
Some excuse and go away

1088
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:13,466
Don't talk about leaving
I want to marry you

1089
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,100
Come to me, bring your lips together
And whistle with me

1090
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,466
Just whistle with me

1091
01:12:33,166 --> 01:12:35,200
Just whistle with me

1092
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:39,200
Why are you so worried, baby?
I am your life, baby

1093
01:12:39,333 --> 01:12:41,266
It's your chance
So hold me tight

1094
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,766
Or else you'll lose it today

1095
01:12:44,066 --> 01:12:48,033
Come with me
I'll teach you everything about love

1096
01:12:48,166 --> 01:12:49,433
Get a hundred out of a hundred

1097
01:12:49,566 --> 01:12:52,033
And bring your lips together
And whistle

1098
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:54,366
-Just whistle, just whistle
-Yo!

1099
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,300
-Everybody in the party, just whistle
-Yo!

1100
01:12:56,433 --> 01:12:57,633
-Just whistle
-Yo!

1101
01:12:57,766 --> 01:13:01,066
-Just whistle
-Just whistle with me

1102
01:13:02,433 --> 01:13:05,000
Dance with me

1103
01:13:05,133 --> 01:13:07,600
Keep my heart with you
My love

1104
01:13:07,733 --> 01:13:11,166
Girl, watch out
The boys are out to flirt with you

1105
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:15,300
I won't give them a chance
I want to be yours

1106
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:19,800
I won't find a crazy lover
Like you anywhere

1107
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:23,766
If you want to do something
And move ahead in life

1108
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:28,233
Come to me, bring your lips together
And whistle with me

1109
01:13:35,033 --> 01:13:36,733
Just whistle with me

1110
01:13:43,466 --> 01:13:45,300
Just whistle with me

1111
01:14:00,533 --> 01:14:03,266
Just whistle with me

1112
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:10,500
God is great

1113
01:14:24,733 --> 01:14:27,066
Oh, my God.
We're in Delhi.

1114
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,766
But what's the position?

1115
01:14:29,133 --> 01:14:30,733
Draft your wills, boys.

1116
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,500
I didn't understand one thing.

1117
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:36,600
You revealed their secret.

1118
01:14:37,133 --> 01:14:39,066
So now they will be caught.

1119
01:14:40,233 --> 01:14:42,166
They'd be caught
if they were in Delhi.

1120
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,266
I lied to them.

1121
01:14:45,566 --> 01:14:47,133
You're such a scoundrel.

1122
01:14:47,266 --> 01:14:49,033
Friends are scoundrels.

1123
01:14:49,166 --> 01:14:51,000
And if they aren't,
they are not your friends.

1124
01:14:52,466 --> 01:14:54,266
They boarded the bus to Shimla.

1125
01:15:09,433 --> 01:15:10,600
These are the details received...

1126
01:15:10,733 --> 01:15:12,133
...from the other police stations
of Delhi.

1127
01:15:13,433 --> 01:15:15,600
Don't you want to confess?
Come on, tell me.

1128
01:15:15,733 --> 01:15:17,700
Inspector, this won't help.

1129
01:15:18,733 --> 01:15:20,166
Stop it.

1130
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,133
-Hello, Mr. Chaudhary.
-Any information?

1131
01:15:24,666 --> 01:15:27,466
We've rounded up local
goons, gangsters...

1132
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:28,766
...pimps, drug peddlers...

1133
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:30,533
...from every nook
and corner of Delhi.

1134
01:15:31,466 --> 01:15:33,266
But we haven't gotten a clue yet.

1135
01:15:34,033 --> 01:15:35,566
-But we're trying--
-Trying?

1136
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:37,166
Get lost!

1137
01:15:45,033 --> 01:15:46,066
I'm sorry.

1138
01:15:46,766 --> 01:15:47,766
Sorry.

1139
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:51,666
Please, just find my daughter
as soon as you can.

1140
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:54,200
Otherwise I won't
be sorry next time.

1141
01:15:55,533 --> 01:15:56,566
Please.

1142
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:58,366
I am really scared.

1143
01:15:58,766 --> 01:16:01,366
Bablu, can't we run away?

1144
01:16:03,766 --> 01:16:06,066
-Here.
-Very good.

1145
01:16:06,433 --> 01:16:07,633
We won't run anymore.

1146
01:16:07,766 --> 01:16:12,033
We'll make the Jats run
from one end to another.

1147
01:16:13,666 --> 01:16:15,800
-How much are you going to eat?
-This is the first one.

1148
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:17,366
The first one's
just like the last one.

1149
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:18,733
Try the green chutney.

1150
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:20,766
Forget the green chutney...

1151
01:16:21,066 --> 01:16:22,766
...or else they'll get married.

1152
01:16:23,066 --> 01:16:24,066
Hey.

1153
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:26,333
Get to the point.

1154
01:16:26,566 --> 01:16:29,433
If I know Rakesh...

1155
01:16:30,566 --> 01:16:32,600
...he'll go to a temple
to get married first.

1156
01:16:32,733 --> 01:16:34,066
What did you say?

1157
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,233
Let's go to the temple.

1158
01:16:43,433 --> 01:16:46,300
Community wedding!
I want to get married too.

1159
01:16:46,433 --> 01:16:47,666
Do you have a mind of your own?

1160
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,766
You always want
something or the other.

1161
01:16:50,266 --> 01:16:51,500
God.

1162
01:16:52,633 --> 01:16:54,433
Please bring Renu back.

1163
01:16:56,066 --> 01:16:58,400
I'll curse the day if I find out...

1164
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,366
...that Renu eloped willingly.

1165
01:17:02,733 --> 01:17:04,600
I beg of you.

1166
01:17:07,533 --> 01:17:08,633
Renu.

1167
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,266
Listen....

1168
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:20,100
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

1169
01:17:20,733 --> 01:17:22,466
I haven't thought about it yet.

1170
01:17:23,466 --> 01:17:25,233
But I guess I'll go crazy now.

1171
01:17:27,366 --> 01:17:28,766
Do you know why
I brought you here?

1172
01:17:30,433 --> 01:17:32,233
Because no one dares
to tell lies here.

1173
01:17:33,033 --> 01:17:34,200
Honestly...

1174
01:17:35,566 --> 01:17:37,033
...I like you a lot.

1175
01:17:38,433 --> 01:17:39,766
And if you try...

1176
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:43,233
...I guarantee you that
you'll start liking me too.

1177
01:17:43,366 --> 01:17:45,233
Are you showing me attitude,
even here?

1178
01:17:45,366 --> 01:17:46,633
I can't help it.

1179
01:17:47,033 --> 01:17:48,266
Everyone doesn't have it.

1180
01:17:49,233 --> 01:17:50,333
And I can't lose it.

1181
01:17:51,766 --> 01:17:53,300
Let go of my hand.

1182
01:17:54,033 --> 01:17:55,066
Okay.

1183
01:17:56,633 --> 01:17:59,666
-What's going on?
-Don't look at us.

1184
01:18:00,133 --> 01:18:01,233
Look at Lord Hanuman.

1185
01:18:01,366 --> 01:18:03,500
Wait, I'll tell Mr. Chaudhary.

1186
01:18:03,633 --> 01:18:04,733
-No.
-Tenne, come here.

1187
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,333
-Why are you beating him?
-He's having a fit.

1188
01:18:13,466 --> 01:18:15,400
Then make him smell
leather boots.

1189
01:18:15,533 --> 01:18:16,533
-Do you have one?
-I do. I do.

1190
01:18:16,666 --> 01:18:18,566
-Then do it.
-No.

1191
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:25,000
Search everyone properly.

1192
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:26,300
Look at her face.

1193
01:18:35,666 --> 01:18:37,733
Please find someone else.

1194
01:18:38,033 --> 01:18:39,766
-I won't find anyone like you.
-Of course you will.

1195
01:18:40,066 --> 01:18:41,333
There are so many girls
in this world.

1196
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:42,700
Make an effort.

1197
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,233
That's what I am doing.

1198
01:18:45,433 --> 01:18:46,633
But I can't find anyone.

1199
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,766
I am not handsome.

1200
01:18:53,266 --> 01:18:54,500
You are.

1201
01:18:56,133 --> 01:18:59,400
-Really?
-Yes. You're very handsome.

1202
01:18:59,533 --> 01:19:00,566
Really?

1203
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:03,333
Look, you are tall.

1204
01:19:03,466 --> 01:19:06,533
-What are you saying?
-Your features are nice.

1205
01:19:07,533 --> 01:19:08,700
Anything else?

1206
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:11,466
You have a good nose too.
What else do you want?

1207
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,100
I don't have good lips.

1208
01:19:14,466 --> 01:19:15,533
They are fine.

1209
01:19:15,666 --> 01:19:17,533
No one's going to kiss me,
what's the point?

1210
01:19:17,666 --> 01:19:20,066
She will. Of course she will.

1211
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,000
Will she?

1212
01:19:36,733 --> 01:19:38,300
Then what are you waiting for?

1213
01:19:43,566 --> 01:19:45,100
Darn this phone.

1214
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:51,000
See! He held her hand.

1215
01:19:51,133 --> 01:19:53,400
Didn't I tell you
he held her hand?

1216
01:19:53,566 --> 01:19:55,366
What are you doing,
Mr. Chaudhary?

1217
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:58,033
You left her all alone.

1218
01:19:58,433 --> 01:20:00,666
This place is teeming
with weirdos, you know.

1219
01:20:02,266 --> 01:20:03,733
Please hold on to her.

1220
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:07,100
We couldn't find anyone here.
We looked everywhere.

1221
01:20:07,233 --> 01:20:10,166
If I know Rakesh...

1222
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,466
...he might've gone to
the court to get married.

1223
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,666
Let's check there.

1224
01:20:31,433 --> 01:20:34,233
Love commando,
you're acting too smart.

1225
01:20:34,366 --> 01:20:36,766
Stay within your limits.
I own brick furnaces.

1226
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:38,566
Thanks for telling me.

1227
01:20:39,433 --> 01:20:40,766
You won't need a funeral pyre.

1228
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:45,100
Brother, please sit here.

1229
01:20:45,233 --> 01:20:47,233
Sukhi and I'll go
and check inside.

1230
01:21:00,766 --> 01:21:02,366
Wait here. We'll go in
and make arrangements.

1231
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:03,566
Please sit.

1232
01:21:04,333 --> 01:21:07,066
-Be comfortable, sister.
-We're comfortable, brother.

1233
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,033
Why are you crying?

1234
01:21:17,166 --> 01:21:19,633
We'll be together forever
in no time.

1235
01:21:19,766 --> 01:21:22,533
The officer wants to know
where her parents are.

1236
01:21:22,666 --> 01:21:25,133
Tell him her father is busy
looking for us.

1237
01:21:26,666 --> 01:21:28,566
Don't cry.
Baby, it's no problem at all.

1238
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:30,200
Excuse me.

1239
01:21:31,033 --> 01:21:32,033
Why is she crying?

1240
01:21:32,166 --> 01:21:33,733
She's missing her father.

1241
01:21:34,333 --> 01:21:36,000
Her father is a scumbag.

1242
01:21:36,133 --> 01:21:37,133
Sorry.

1243
01:21:37,766 --> 01:21:40,000
He makes millions,
drives a Mercedes.

1244
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:41,733
But he is so narrow-minded.

1245
01:21:42,366 --> 01:21:43,566
Don't cry, my dear.

1246
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:45,633
And who are you?

1247
01:21:45,766 --> 01:21:49,100
I drive her father's car.
I am her driver.

1248
01:21:49,733 --> 01:21:51,400
In fact, I was....

1249
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,633
Her father used to
pay me peanuts.

1250
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,466
He beat me up.

1251
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,433
He said, "Why do you love her?"

1252
01:21:59,566 --> 01:22:02,733
I eloped with his daughter.
Now let him search. Right?

1253
01:22:03,133 --> 01:22:06,200
-Won't your father be worried?
-He will, for a few days.

1254
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:08,666
He'll look for us
and go to the police station.

1255
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:09,800
We don't care.

1256
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:12,533
We'll already be off to Manali
for our honeymoon.

1257
01:22:15,133 --> 01:22:17,533
Don't worry.
He'll come back to me begging.

1258
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:20,066
Later on, he'll welcome me home.

1259
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,200
Where do you get the courage?

1260
01:22:22,533 --> 01:22:24,733
From friends. Best friends.

1261
01:22:25,333 --> 01:22:26,666
Love you, buddy.

1262
01:22:28,266 --> 01:22:29,266
Haven't you heard that saying?

1263
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,733
'"Ghalib, no one can control love."

1264
01:22:31,466 --> 01:22:32,466
You must have,
it's a famous one.

1265
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:35,300
By the way, what do you think?

1266
01:22:35,666 --> 01:22:38,466
Do you think the girl sitting next to you
will never fall in love?

1267
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:43,633
Tell me, sister. Will you live
all your life with this man?

1268
01:22:43,766 --> 01:22:46,400
Is he your father?
Will you live with him?

1269
01:22:46,533 --> 01:22:48,233
Listen, her relatives
are looking for her.

1270
01:22:48,366 --> 01:22:50,033
Darn these relatives.

1271
01:22:50,533 --> 01:22:52,433
That's their nature.

1272
01:22:52,566 --> 01:22:54,333
They enjoy it
while the search goes on.

1273
01:22:54,466 --> 01:22:57,433
They snack till they drop.
Total fun.

1274
01:22:57,566 --> 01:23:00,233
Am I right, mister?

1275
01:23:02,066 --> 01:23:03,533
-Pull your stomach in.
-Rascal!

1276
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:06,066
Do you think a court marriage...

1277
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,033
...is the answer to your responsibilities?

1278
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:10,133
Don't you have a conscience?

1279
01:23:10,566 --> 01:23:11,733
You eloped with the girl.

1280
01:23:12,033 --> 01:23:14,000
Didn't you think
about her parents?

1281
01:23:14,133 --> 01:23:16,766
And you? Do you like
hurting your parents?

1282
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:18,600
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

1283
01:23:18,733 --> 01:23:20,233
-And you--
-Brother...

1284
01:23:21,666 --> 01:23:23,133
...they are not in there.

1285
01:23:23,633 --> 01:23:25,700
Their application
isn't even in the register.

1286
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,333
Shame on you.

1287
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,366
Why are you crying?
Don't worry. That man's worried.

1288
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:33,766
I love you.
Everything will be fine.

1289
01:23:55,300 --> 01:24:01,100
Without you, life is dull

1290
01:24:01,366 --> 01:24:06,633
Life is dull

1291
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:14,300
Excuse me, mister.
Have you seen them?

1292
01:24:14,433 --> 01:24:16,133
No, sir. I haven't seen them.

1293
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,666
Go away or you'll die.

1294
01:24:38,233 --> 01:24:39,233
Listen to me.

1295
01:24:39,366 --> 01:24:42,500
I told you. We have no future.

1296
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:44,766
Thank God you told me.

1297
01:24:45,066 --> 01:24:46,766
Easy challenges don't excite me.

1298
01:24:48,466 --> 01:24:50,033
That's why I chose you
as my wife.

1299
01:24:52,433 --> 01:24:53,633
Here.

1300
01:24:53,766 --> 01:24:55,066
Marriage form.

1301
01:24:55,566 --> 01:24:57,000
I already signed it.

1302
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:58,733
We're almost married.

1303
01:24:59,333 --> 01:25:01,100
Sign it and we'll be
all the way married.

1304
01:25:01,233 --> 01:25:02,300
What?

1305
01:25:06,133 --> 01:25:08,600
Mr. Chaudhary,
Renu is in that van!

1306
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:25,100
Stop! You Idiot!

1307
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:32,400
-Stop the van!
-Stop it.

1308
01:25:39,066 --> 01:25:40,366
Come out!

1309
01:25:40,733 --> 01:25:41,766
-Get everyone out.
-Out!

1310
01:25:42,066 --> 01:25:43,266
Get down! Hurry!

1311
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:46,066
-You! Get down now!
-Keep moving. Keep moving.

1312
01:25:48,133 --> 01:25:49,533
Come on, get down.

1313
01:25:50,333 --> 01:25:51,466
Come out now!

1314
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,233
-Renu!
-The last one, come out now!

1315
01:25:53,366 --> 01:25:54,366
Come on!

1316
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,433
-Renu!
-Didn't you hear me?

1317
01:25:56,566 --> 01:25:58,200
-Get down!
-Renu!

1318
01:25:58,433 --> 01:25:59,533
Renu.

1319
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:05,133
Get out of the way.

1320
01:26:11,766 --> 01:26:13,600
Why are you guys
forcing everyone to get out?

1321
01:26:13,733 --> 01:26:15,233
You just want to
trouble everyone.

1322
01:26:15,366 --> 01:26:18,400
Madam, forgive me.
I made a mistake.

1323
01:26:21,066 --> 01:26:24,166
It was a mistake.
Everyone makes one.

1324
01:26:25,633 --> 01:26:27,000
Let's go.

1325
01:26:49,733 --> 01:26:51,566
Dimpy. Dimpy.

1326
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,300
There was a girl sitting here.
Did you see her?

1327
01:26:55,433 --> 01:26:57,500
-No, sir.
-Dimpy.

1328
01:26:57,633 --> 01:26:59,766
Mister, my daughter was sitting
right here. Did you see her?

1329
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:01,333
She was wearing a blue dress.

1330
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:02,766
-Dimpy!
-Look there!

1331
01:27:03,066 --> 01:27:04,800
Mr. Chaudhary,
it's your mistake.

1332
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,633
Why did you bring her along?
You lost both your daughters now.

1333
01:27:13,433 --> 01:27:16,000
No! Let go of me! Save me!

1334
01:27:20,133 --> 01:27:22,500
Go away! What are you doing?

1335
01:27:26,733 --> 01:27:31,266
No! No! No!

1336
01:27:33,033 --> 01:27:36,200
Help! Save me!
Let go of my hand!

1337
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:41,766
Save me! Help!

1338
01:27:44,433 --> 01:27:46,300
Leave me! Help!

1339
01:27:48,666 --> 01:27:55,100
God is great

1340
01:27:58,133 --> 01:28:00,166
Let me go! Help!

1341
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,433
Let me go!

1342
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:14,066
Save me! No!

1343
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:17,333
Let go of my hand!

1344
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,333
Let go of me! No.

1345
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:22,666
Go away!

1346
01:28:25,033 --> 01:28:26,400
It's a small word.

1347
01:28:27,666 --> 01:28:29,033
Nahi  in Hindi.

1348
01:28:29,566 --> 01:28:30,700
"No" in English.

1349
01:28:33,566 --> 01:28:34,766
And no means no.

1350
01:29:36,333 --> 01:29:37,533
Bablu!

1351
01:29:56,233 --> 01:30:02,033
Without you, life is dull

1352
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:07,766
Life is dull

1353
01:30:30,766 --> 01:30:32,100
Dimpy!

1354
01:30:32,233 --> 01:30:33,266
Dimpy!

1355
01:30:33,733 --> 01:30:34,800
Search there!

1356
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:36,300
Dad!

1357
01:30:47,133 --> 01:30:49,500
How dare you touch her!

1358
01:30:50,433 --> 01:30:51,766
How dare you!

1359
01:30:53,633 --> 01:30:55,066
Are you a kid?

1360
01:30:55,366 --> 01:30:57,333
Don't you know that
you should stay together?

1361
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,333
What if something
had happened to you today?

1362
01:31:00,466 --> 01:31:02,233
-Stay within your limits.
-Rajjo!

1363
01:31:10,233 --> 01:31:11,500
Dress your wounds.

1364
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,066
Come on.

1365
01:31:14,433 --> 01:31:15,566
Come on.

1366
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:35,333
Listen....

1367
01:31:38,333 --> 01:31:41,700
It was an eventful day.
I didn't even thank you.

1368
01:31:42,433 --> 01:31:43,566
What for?

1369
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:45,500
For saving me.

1370
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,400
No one can save you, Dimpy.

1371
01:31:49,266 --> 01:31:51,000
Your life's already over.

1372
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:56,166
I never got along
with my father.

1373
01:31:56,566 --> 01:32:00,333
He would ask me to do something,
and I always said no.

1374
01:32:02,166 --> 01:32:04,100
Have you ever said no
to your father?

1375
01:32:06,233 --> 01:32:07,366
No, right?

1376
01:32:08,066 --> 01:32:10,400
Have you ever lived
the way you wanted?

1377
01:32:11,233 --> 01:32:12,266
No.

1378
01:32:12,733 --> 01:32:15,500
Your family treats women
like animals.

1379
01:32:15,633 --> 01:32:17,366
Have you ever revolted?

1380
01:32:19,233 --> 01:32:22,433
You have to fight.
That's how you get equality.

1381
01:32:24,766 --> 01:32:26,733
You just get one life.
Do you get it?

1382
01:32:27,366 --> 01:32:30,200
-We only live once.
-Bablu, I want to live too.

1383
01:32:30,333 --> 01:32:32,100
-But--
-No ifs and buts.

1384
01:32:32,733 --> 01:32:34,033
Be brave.

1385
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:36,666
Admit to your father
that you love me.

1386
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:54,333
But you love your dreams,
don't you?

1387
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:55,700
Yes.

1388
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,466
So choose one.

1389
01:33:02,433 --> 01:33:03,566
Choose?

1390
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:05,000
Go ahead.

1391
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:19,433
Let's stay up all night

1392
01:33:20,066 --> 01:33:26,200
Let's not go home

1393
01:33:48,433 --> 01:33:54,500
Let's stay up all night

1394
01:33:55,433 --> 01:34:02,066
Let's not go home

1395
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:09,466
You're with me
What's there to worry about?

1396
01:34:09,633 --> 01:34:16,233
Let's not go home
Let's stay up all night

1397
01:34:16,633 --> 01:34:23,566
Let's go wherever we want to

1398
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:30,366
We might not meet
Each other again

1399
01:34:30,766 --> 01:34:37,766
Let's live our lives tonight
This night

1400
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:44,733
Let's stay up all night

1401
01:34:45,133 --> 01:34:52,133
Let's not go home

1402
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:21,233
I wonder why this night
Wants me to change everything

1403
01:35:21,366 --> 01:35:24,733
The night wants me
To touch the sky

1404
01:35:25,033 --> 01:35:28,200
And live in the moment
Tonight

1405
01:35:28,333 --> 01:35:31,700
So let's get up
And walk and falter

1406
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:38,133
Let's get up and fly
I'll lend you my wings

1407
01:35:38,266 --> 01:35:45,233
Let's live our lives tonight
This night

1408
01:35:45,366 --> 01:35:48,700
-Let's stay up all night
-Up all night

1409
01:35:49,033 --> 01:35:52,300
-Let's stay up all night
-Up all night

1410
01:35:52,433 --> 01:35:55,766
-Let's not go home
-Don't go home

1411
01:35:56,100 --> 01:36:00,366
Let's stay up all night

1412
01:36:29,566 --> 01:36:35,766
Let's stay up all night

1413
01:36:36,633 --> 01:36:43,400
Let's not go home

1414
01:36:58,366 --> 01:37:00,133
Sir, this is the guest house.

1415
01:37:00,266 --> 01:37:02,600
Clean this mess
and leave Room 2.

1416
01:37:02,766 --> 01:37:04,533
Open Room 7.

1417
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:39,233
Tell us where they have gone.

1418
01:37:39,366 --> 01:37:43,166
I never ask a man if he has eloped
with someone's daughter...

1419
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:44,633
...or someone's wife.

1420
01:37:44,766 --> 01:37:48,233
I charge them by the hour.
That's all.

1421
01:37:48,366 --> 01:37:50,466
-Who are you guys?
-Hey!

1422
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:53,066
Just tell us
where we can find them.

1423
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:55,066
They ran out of money.

1424
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,133
The girl pawned her
gold necklace.

1425
01:37:57,333 --> 01:37:59,400
After that,
she had nothing to offer.

1426
01:37:59,533 --> 01:38:01,566
But I asked her
to pay the rent first...

1427
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:02,700
...or get out of here.

1428
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,566
Who is going to pay me now?

1429
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:06,033
Rascal!

1430
01:38:06,166 --> 01:38:07,333
Don't touch him.

1431
01:38:08,066 --> 01:38:09,400
How do you know it was them?

1432
01:38:12,533 --> 01:38:13,633
Did they look like them?

1433
01:38:14,166 --> 01:38:15,366
That's them.

1434
01:38:15,633 --> 01:38:17,000
It was them.

1435
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,133
Now pay up.

1436
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,133
Come on.

1437
01:38:28,166 --> 01:38:29,633
Do you want to die?

1438
01:38:32,166 --> 01:38:33,400
Come on!

1439
01:38:33,633 --> 01:38:35,266
-What's wrong with you?
-Come on!

1440
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:36,600
What's wrong with you?

1441
01:38:37,233 --> 01:38:38,766
Sir. Sir, calm down.

1442
01:38:39,466 --> 01:38:41,433
-Come on!
-You should go home, Mr. Chaudhary.

1443
01:38:41,566 --> 01:38:43,633
-Everyone is looking for you.
-What home?

1444
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:45,733
Yes.

1445
01:38:47,433 --> 01:38:50,033
The lodge where my daughter stayed.

1446
01:38:53,366 --> 01:38:54,666
You saw the lodge, didn't you?

1447
01:38:56,233 --> 01:38:58,133
This is where
he kept my daughter.

1448
01:39:00,766 --> 01:39:03,300
Is this why they eloped?

1449
01:39:05,366 --> 01:39:06,766
Is this what you call youth?

1450
01:39:08,366 --> 01:39:10,400
Don't we understand
their feelings?

1451
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,300
Even I was young 25 years ago.

1452
01:39:15,766 --> 01:39:18,600
I was so arrogant.
I never listened to anyone.

1453
01:39:18,733 --> 01:39:21,766
No one. I never listened
to my parents or my wife.

1454
01:39:24,466 --> 01:39:26,433
But then I became a father...

1455
01:39:27,633 --> 01:39:29,200
...when Renu was born.

1456
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:34,500
She was so small
when I first held her.

1457
01:39:36,666 --> 01:39:38,233
I quit all my vices.

1458
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:41,766
I slogged away.

1459
01:39:43,533 --> 01:39:46,100
I became rich,
and people respected me.

1460
01:39:47,366 --> 01:39:49,400
I even learned English for her.

1461
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,466
And then someone
took her away from me.

1462
01:39:53,333 --> 01:39:54,333
Love....

1463
01:39:55,166 --> 01:39:56,466
Is this what you call love?

1464
01:39:57,333 --> 01:39:58,600
They are broke.

1465
01:39:59,533 --> 01:40:01,433
That guy is not capable
of supporting them.

1466
01:40:01,566 --> 01:40:03,100
He got help from his friends
and eloped with her...

1467
01:40:03,233 --> 01:40:04,500
...and he thinks he is a hero.

1468
01:40:05,766 --> 01:40:07,566
Is this how you become a hero?

1469
01:40:11,433 --> 01:40:14,600
He sold her gold necklace
when he ran out of money.

1470
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:19,200
And if they don't get along...

1471
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:21,166
...will he divorce her?

1472
01:40:23,766 --> 01:40:25,066
But...

1473
01:40:25,466 --> 01:40:27,700
...I can't abandon my daughter.

1474
01:40:29,766 --> 01:40:31,200
I am a father.

1475
01:40:32,766 --> 01:40:35,500
I raised her,
took care of her for 20 years.

1476
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,533
I've fulfilled every responsibility
of a father.

1477
01:40:43,066 --> 01:40:45,166
I wanted to get her married.

1478
01:40:46,566 --> 01:40:48,500
I wanted her to be happy.

1479
01:40:50,366 --> 01:40:52,300
But where's my daughter?

1480
01:40:53,566 --> 01:40:54,766
Where is she?

1481
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:57,733
I have lost her.

1482
01:40:59,133 --> 01:41:02,733
My reputation is tarnished.
I've lost everything.

1483
01:41:04,033 --> 01:41:06,166
I want my daughter back.

1484
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:08,600
Where's my daughter?

1485
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:11,666
Where's my daughter?

1486
01:41:12,633 --> 01:41:15,633
Where's my daughter?

1487
01:41:17,733 --> 01:41:20,533
Where's my daughter?

1488
01:41:32,433 --> 01:41:34,300
The day I find her...

1489
01:41:35,033 --> 01:41:36,233
...I'll kill her.

1490
01:41:36,733 --> 01:41:39,166
I'll kill her
right then and there.

1491
01:42:02,166 --> 01:42:03,366
Listen....

1492
01:42:03,566 --> 01:42:05,433
Do you think
they will be caught?

1493
01:42:07,433 --> 01:42:08,466
I don't know.

1494
01:42:09,733 --> 01:42:10,733
You know...

1495
01:42:11,033 --> 01:42:13,266
...earlier even I wanted them
to be caught.

1496
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:19,500
But everyone has a right
to make their own decisions.

1497
01:42:20,666 --> 01:42:22,200
I should too.

1498
01:42:23,766 --> 01:42:25,600
Because we only
live once, right?

1499
01:42:29,266 --> 01:42:31,166
Do we have to run away
like them?

1500
01:42:37,533 --> 01:42:39,266
I can't tell my dad...

1501
01:42:41,233 --> 01:42:42,633
...but I'll tell you.

1502
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:53,400
I love you.

1503
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:57,400
I love you, Bablu.

1504
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:04,600
Renu!

1505
01:43:06,766 --> 01:43:08,200
Renu, stop!

1506
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:11,633
-Start the car.
-Renu!

1507
01:43:12,733 --> 01:43:14,100
Renu!

1508
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,366
Renu!

1509
01:43:20,266 --> 01:43:21,666
Stop the bus!

1510
01:43:22,566 --> 01:43:24,066
Renu!

1511
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:26,566
-Dad?
-Renu!

1512
01:43:28,533 --> 01:43:29,766
Stop the bus!

1513
01:43:32,166 --> 01:43:33,400
Dad.

1514
01:43:34,333 --> 01:43:35,633
Renu!

1515
01:43:37,133 --> 01:43:38,266
Renu!

1516
01:43:43,533 --> 01:43:45,033
Renu, stop!

1517
01:43:46,166 --> 01:43:48,133
-Renu!
-Renu!

1518
01:43:48,433 --> 01:43:49,466
Renu, come on!

1519
01:43:49,766 --> 01:43:51,366
-Renu!
-Come on!

1520
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:14,700
Beat him!

1521
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:17,500
Let him go.

1522
01:44:17,633 --> 01:44:19,100
Leave him!

1523
01:44:19,666 --> 01:44:21,766
No, Dad, don't beat him!

1524
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:24,100
-No!
-Move it!

1525
01:44:24,733 --> 01:44:26,166
Come on!

1526
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:35,766
-Move.
-Try hitting me now.

1527
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:39,066
Let go of them.

1528
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:42,266
Dad, please spare him.

1529
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,300
Move back!
Don't touch them!

1530
01:44:54,366 --> 01:44:57,133
Sir, please forgive them.

1531
01:44:57,666 --> 01:45:00,100
Mr. Chaudhary,
please forgive them.

1532
01:45:01,066 --> 01:45:02,500
-Move away.
-Dad, please!

1533
01:45:02,633 --> 01:45:04,133
Dad, let him go.

1534
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:06,766
-Sir, please hear me out.
-Don't you dare!

1535
01:45:07,166 --> 01:45:09,166
Don't you dare touch him!

1536
01:45:09,533 --> 01:45:11,466
I'll file a complaint
with the police.

1537
01:45:12,466 --> 01:45:13,766
He's my husband.

1538
01:45:14,466 --> 01:45:17,500
Had I told you,
would you let me marry him?

1539
01:45:18,533 --> 01:45:22,300
Why don't I have the right
to make a decision for myself?

1540
01:45:22,433 --> 01:45:23,566
Why?

1541
01:45:25,433 --> 01:45:26,700
Dimpy....

1542
01:45:27,433 --> 01:45:30,166
Tell me, what was my mistake?

1543
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:32,400
Is it a crime
to fall in love?

1544
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:36,600
Why don't you let us
live in peace?

1545
01:45:36,733 --> 01:45:39,433
You've been chasing us like dogs.
Like dogs! Why?

1546
01:45:39,566 --> 01:45:41,066
-Renu!
-No!

1547
01:45:44,133 --> 01:45:45,266
She's right.

1548
01:45:47,233 --> 01:45:48,433
She's right.

1549
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:51,700
I am a dog.

1550
01:45:54,166 --> 01:45:55,600
We're all dogs.

1551
01:45:58,066 --> 01:45:59,500
You ran away from home.

1552
01:46:00,633 --> 01:46:02,400
I was worried about you
the whole time.

1553
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:05,766
I was worried whether
you were all right.

1554
01:46:07,733 --> 01:46:12,100
I've been roaming from one city
to another looking for you.

1555
01:46:13,133 --> 01:46:14,500
I fought with so many people.

1556
01:46:14,633 --> 01:46:16,300
I barked at them
and I snapped at them.

1557
01:46:16,433 --> 01:46:17,633
I am a dog.

1558
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,366
Thank you for reminding me
of who I am.

1559
01:46:27,333 --> 01:46:29,000
I thought I was your father.

1560
01:46:32,033 --> 01:46:35,033
But I am just a dog
who is worried for his daughter.

1561
01:46:40,033 --> 01:46:41,266
I am a dog.

1562
01:46:49,133 --> 01:46:50,266
Dog.

1563
01:46:53,066 --> 01:46:54,466
Forgive me, my dear.

1564
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:56,333
I was wrong.

1565
01:46:57,766 --> 01:46:59,566
I am a dog. Forgive me.

1566
01:47:00,266 --> 01:47:01,700
Enough, Renu.

1567
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:04,033
Now apologize to him...

1568
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:07,300
...and say that he kidnapped you.

1569
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,533
Say it!
Your life will be spared.

1570
01:47:11,566 --> 01:47:14,133
Or else you know our law.

1571
01:47:15,033 --> 01:47:16,166
Say it.

1572
01:47:19,633 --> 01:47:22,666
Brother, please turn around.

1573
01:47:27,433 --> 01:47:29,133
Sit down. Sit down.

1574
01:47:30,333 --> 01:47:32,600
Didn't you hear us?
Lower your heads.

1575
01:47:33,733 --> 01:47:35,666
Look at your shoes. Look down!

1576
01:47:37,066 --> 01:47:38,766
Look down!

1577
01:48:16,766 --> 01:48:18,066
Dad...

1578
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:20,400
...I am pregnant.

1579
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:34,733
You are dead to me.

1580
01:48:37,633 --> 01:48:40,066
Now I have just one daughter.

1581
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:52,500
Yes, we are about to return.
Dimpy, get in the car.

1582
01:49:03,133 --> 01:49:04,233
Bablu....

1583
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:12,066
Sorry for the way
we treated you.

1584
01:49:12,466 --> 01:49:13,700
You are not my enemy.

1585
01:49:14,466 --> 01:49:16,733
I just love my daughter
too much.

1586
01:49:17,566 --> 01:49:19,000
Please don't say that.

1587
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:21,766
If you get the time...

1588
01:49:22,466 --> 01:49:23,766
...do attend Dimpy's wedding.

1589
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:29,500
Kiki, here's your passport.

1590
01:49:29,633 --> 01:49:31,733
Now you can go on
an adventure tour.

1591
01:49:32,066 --> 01:49:34,466
-See you, buddy.
-Kiki.

1592
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:36,200
Goodbye.

1593
01:49:37,066 --> 01:49:38,666
Let's forget our differences.

1594
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,300
I spared your life
because of Chaudhary's presence.

1595
01:49:41,433 --> 01:49:44,233
Otherwise I would've
burned you in a furnace.

1596
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,400
Bablu, it's all right.

1597
01:49:51,333 --> 01:49:52,466
It's all right.

1598
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:57,700
O, God
Why are you angry with me?

1599
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:06,100
I wonder what mistake I made

1600
01:51:07,366 --> 01:51:14,266
My life went astray
When I got separated from you

1601
01:51:15,466 --> 01:51:19,066
I'll destroy myself

1602
01:51:19,566 --> 01:51:23,500
I'll destroy myself

1603
01:51:23,633 --> 01:51:27,500
I'll destroy myself

1604
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Kohl burns in my eyes
I can't wear my stubborn bangles

1605
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:12,300
My bangles will jangle
Only in your presence, my beloved

1606
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:21,300
I don't want to get decked out
Without my beloved

1607
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:29,500
I wonder what mistake I made

1608
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:37,700
My life went astray
When I got separated from you

1609
01:52:39,066 --> 01:52:42,666
I'll destroy myself

1610
01:52:43,266 --> 01:52:47,633
I'll destroy myself

1611
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:17,000
Just tell us one thing.

1612
01:53:17,533 --> 01:53:19,133
Can you live without her?

1613
01:53:22,566 --> 01:53:25,066
Let's go, then.
Let's abduct her.

1614
01:53:30,333 --> 01:53:31,433
Come on.

1615
01:54:08,433 --> 01:54:11,766
Clitter-clatter
The train chugs along

1616
01:54:12,066 --> 01:54:13,566
-Hold on, stop the train.
-Red signal.

1617
01:54:13,700 --> 01:54:15,233
Where's Dimpy?

1618
01:54:15,366 --> 01:54:18,400
How many times are
you going to ask, Grandpa?

1619
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:19,600
Let's go play.

1620
01:54:19,733 --> 01:54:21,166
Come on. Come on.

1621
01:54:33,033 --> 01:54:34,633
I always thought...

1622
01:54:36,066 --> 01:54:38,433
...that I'd be safe in my home.

1623
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:42,700
But today....

1624
01:54:45,166 --> 01:54:46,633
Today I am feeling scared.

1625
01:54:50,566 --> 01:54:52,400
Dad took me to Delhi...

1626
01:54:54,133 --> 01:54:56,166
...because he didn't trust me.

1627
01:54:58,133 --> 01:54:59,733
But I was determined...

1628
01:55:01,433 --> 01:55:04,700
...to never do
what Renu had done.

1629
01:55:05,766 --> 01:55:10,600
But when I left Bablu,
I realized why Renu eloped.

1630
01:55:12,133 --> 01:55:15,200
In this family, a girl child
is killed right after birth.

1631
01:55:16,166 --> 01:55:17,766
Dad didn't kill us then...

1632
01:55:19,233 --> 01:55:20,733
...but he is killing us now.

1633
01:55:23,166 --> 01:55:25,100
What should I do, Shalu?

1634
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:50,033
Pappi, the guys from Delhi
are back!

1635
01:56:12,133 --> 01:56:14,766
-Brother, look who's here.
-Wow!

1636
01:56:15,100 --> 01:56:17,266
We treated you badly,
but you guys are here.

1637
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:18,433
Good, very good.

1638
01:56:18,566 --> 01:56:20,800
So far, you've only
witnessed our fury.

1639
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:22,533
It's time you see our love.

1640
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:24,533
That's what we're here for.

1641
01:56:25,066 --> 01:56:27,766
Come on, please come inside.

1642
01:56:42,033 --> 01:56:43,500
You look so happy.

1643
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:45,133
Yes.

1644
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:46,700
He is here now.

1645
01:56:48,133 --> 01:56:49,233
I am not scared anymore.

1646
01:56:49,366 --> 01:56:51,566
Bhuppi, where's that boy?
Stop him.

1647
01:56:51,700 --> 01:56:53,566
-The wedding procession?
-No.

1648
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:54,700
Bablu....

1649
01:56:55,033 --> 01:56:56,333
Bablu? Why him?

1650
01:56:56,466 --> 01:56:57,766
Forget it. I'll check myself.

1651
01:57:23,500 --> 01:57:26,066
-Where are you going?
-Nowhere.

1652
01:57:26,466 --> 01:57:27,733
Where are your friends?

1653
01:57:28,033 --> 01:57:29,433
They must be around
here somewhere.

1654
01:57:29,566 --> 01:57:31,633
Are you looking for someone?

1655
01:57:32,633 --> 01:57:33,766
Actually, I--

1656
01:57:34,100 --> 01:57:37,066
You're free, aren't you?
Come on. Let's talk.

1657
01:57:38,566 --> 01:57:39,633
Bablu, how about a cold drink?

1658
01:57:39,766 --> 01:57:42,200
He'll drink it later on.
Offer it to someone else.

1659
01:57:49,533 --> 01:57:50,733
Come on.

1660
01:57:51,066 --> 01:57:52,533
Have a seat.

1661
01:57:53,233 --> 01:57:54,333
Sit down.

1662
01:58:02,466 --> 01:58:04,666
-I--
-What pleasant weather.

1663
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:10,100
Everyone's really happy.

1664
01:58:10,700 --> 01:58:13,500
He is a very nice guy.
He comes from a reputed family.

1665
01:58:16,133 --> 01:58:18,133
-If you--
-What about your family?

1666
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:21,300
-Parents?
-They are fine.

1667
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:27,500
I didn't expect you
to drop in like this.

1668
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:29,766
But you did the right thing.

1669
01:58:30,266 --> 01:58:32,000
Because everyone's busy
with the wedding preparations...

1670
01:58:32,133 --> 01:58:33,400
...and I am all alone.

1671
01:58:33,533 --> 01:58:36,066
Now that you're here,
I could use some company.

1672
01:58:41,166 --> 01:58:42,766
Stay with me till the send-off.

1673
01:58:43,566 --> 01:58:45,733
Till the send-off. Please.

1674
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:54,433
Will you stay with me?

1675
01:58:57,766 --> 01:58:59,066
My hand.

1676
01:59:00,266 --> 01:59:01,366
My hand.

1677
01:59:03,166 --> 01:59:04,166
Sorry.

1678
01:59:04,766 --> 01:59:06,033
Sorry.

1679
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:13,400
Listen....

1680
01:59:13,533 --> 01:59:14,600
-Is everything ready?
-Yes.

1681
01:59:14,733 --> 01:59:16,333
I've given the message
to Shalu the maid.

1682
01:59:16,466 --> 01:59:18,166
She'll deliver it to Dimpy.

1683
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:20,100
There you are.

1684
01:59:20,333 --> 01:59:21,533
I've been looking
all over the place.

1685
01:59:21,666 --> 01:59:23,500
The guests are about to arrive.
Go and get changed.

1686
01:59:23,633 --> 01:59:26,666
And leave him alone?
The poor guy is alone.

1687
01:59:27,566 --> 01:59:30,500
He's here to attend the wedding,
not to chat with you. Come on.

1688
01:59:30,633 --> 01:59:32,433
Go, I'll just have
a chat with him.

1689
01:59:32,566 --> 01:59:33,566
You see...

1690
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:35,666
-...the groom--
-He isn't going anywhere...

1691
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:37,566
-...till the wedding is over. Come on.
-No, no.

1692
01:59:37,700 --> 01:59:40,533
The guests are about to arrive.
Come on.

1693
01:59:40,733 --> 01:59:42,400
-I'll be right back.
-Come on.

1694
01:59:46,766 --> 01:59:49,066
Not this one. Yes.

1695
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:52,633
Brother, your turban.

1696
01:59:52,766 --> 01:59:54,766
-Do you know where he is?
-I don't know.

1697
01:59:55,066 --> 01:59:56,200
-Bablu.
-Where's Dimpy?

1698
01:59:56,333 --> 01:59:57,600
-We're looking for her.
-I have no idea.

1699
01:59:58,433 --> 01:59:59,733
Forget it.
Look over there.

1700
02:00:00,066 --> 02:00:02,466
I will. Relax. Just relax.

1701
02:00:08,433 --> 02:00:09,566
Bablu.

1702
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:45,233
Has anyone seen Dimpy?

1703
02:00:50,766 --> 02:00:53,366
Remember you always said...

1704
02:00:54,166 --> 02:00:55,766
...that you stopped
because you saw me.

1705
02:00:58,266 --> 02:01:00,200
You inspired me to live my life.

1706
02:01:01,066 --> 02:01:02,266
I started flying.

1707
02:01:03,033 --> 02:01:04,233
I started living.

1708
02:01:08,300 --> 02:01:09,700
How do I tell Dad...

1709
02:01:10,700 --> 02:01:12,300
...that I want to live my own life?

1710
02:01:14,366 --> 02:01:15,566
He knows everything.

1711
02:01:16,700 --> 02:01:19,266
Oh, my God!
So, what is the position now?

1712
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:20,766
Their position
is worse than ours.

1713
02:01:21,066 --> 02:01:23,333
-Dear, did we get laddus?
-Hurry! Let's go.

1714
02:01:24,133 --> 02:01:25,366
Hey....

1715
02:01:37,133 --> 02:01:38,366
What happened, Dad?

1716
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:41,066
Why are you staring
at me like that?

1717
02:01:41,766 --> 02:01:43,066
Nothing.

1718
02:01:53,700 --> 02:01:55,466
You took such good care of me.

1719
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:57,000
Yes.

1720
02:01:57,133 --> 02:01:59,066
You've always been there for me.

1721
02:02:05,266 --> 02:02:07,333
Today you're sending me
to a place...

1722
02:02:10,333 --> 02:02:12,033
...where you won't be with me.

1723
02:02:14,666 --> 02:02:16,366
But your decision must be right.

1724
02:02:19,766 --> 02:02:22,266
I can see my entire life, Dad.

1725
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:29,600
But I will manage somehow.

1726
02:02:31,766 --> 02:02:34,300
Don't worry, Dad.

1727
02:02:52,566 --> 02:02:54,166
What happened, brother?

1728
02:02:54,466 --> 02:02:57,033
She has to leave someday.

1729
02:02:57,766 --> 02:02:59,366
Enough.

1730
02:03:02,233 --> 02:03:03,266
Get up.

1731
02:03:03,733 --> 02:03:05,233
Get her ready.

1732
02:03:43,100 --> 02:03:45,033
You know what's going on
in my house.

1733
02:03:46,366 --> 02:03:48,200
My daughter's getting married.

1734
02:03:50,300 --> 02:03:51,600
And you are also aware...

1735
02:03:52,600 --> 02:03:55,633
...that a boy eloped
with my elder daughter.

1736
02:03:57,433 --> 02:03:58,700
And now, you....

1737
02:03:59,433 --> 02:04:00,733
Why are you here?

1738
02:04:01,766 --> 02:04:03,200
Be honest.

1739
02:04:04,766 --> 02:04:08,333
You came here to elope with
my younger daughter, didn't you?

1740
02:04:10,066 --> 02:04:12,133
Eloping isn't difficult,
Mr. Chaudhary.

1741
02:04:15,466 --> 02:04:16,700
Nor am I scared.

1742
02:04:21,133 --> 02:04:22,400
When Renu ran away...

1743
02:04:23,666 --> 02:04:25,400
...I was amused
that you were troubled.

1744
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:28,633
But when I saw you...

1745
02:04:31,133 --> 02:04:32,566
...I gradually realized
what a father feels...

1746
02:04:34,066 --> 02:04:36,233
...when his daughter runs away.

1747
02:04:40,466 --> 02:04:44,400
Today when I noticed
your plight...

1748
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:47,300
...I was really scared.

1749
02:04:49,633 --> 02:04:51,100
I never thought
like this before.

1750
02:04:53,366 --> 02:04:54,733
I was happy.

1751
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:57,666
I was always happy.

1752
02:05:02,166 --> 02:05:03,400
But today....

1753
02:05:06,200 --> 02:05:07,433
Today, I am sad.

1754
02:05:09,633 --> 02:05:11,100
There is no one.

1755
02:05:13,466 --> 02:05:15,133
I have no one
to share my pain.

1756
02:05:18,166 --> 02:05:19,666
No one can understand either.

1757
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:23,766
But you can understand.

1758
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:30,366
The other day Dimpy
went missing for 20 minutes...

1759
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:33,066
...and I was worried to death.

1760
02:05:35,166 --> 02:05:37,466
Later I realized
Renu was missing for 20 days.

1761
02:05:44,333 --> 02:05:46,033
Do you know what's going on
in this house?

1762
02:05:48,433 --> 02:05:50,433
The girl I love
is getting married.

1763
02:05:52,133 --> 02:05:54,100
And she is also your daughter.

1764
02:05:56,266 --> 02:05:58,333
You want no trouble
at the wedding...

1765
02:06:00,266 --> 02:06:02,366
...and I want to stop
this wedding at all cost.

1766
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:06,433
You want to save your honor...

1767
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:11,566
...and I want to save my love.

1768
02:06:15,433 --> 02:06:17,300
We're sailing in the same boat.

1769
02:06:19,333 --> 02:06:21,400
No one loves Dimpy like you do.

1770
02:06:23,333 --> 02:06:27,533
But if there's anyone
who comes second...

1771
02:06:29,366 --> 02:06:30,733
...that would be me.

1772
02:06:34,733 --> 02:06:37,100
I came here to take her away.

1773
02:06:40,433 --> 02:06:42,266
But I'm not going to elope
with your daughter.

1774
02:06:55,500 --> 02:06:56,766
Bablu, what are you doing?

1775
02:06:57,466 --> 02:06:59,500
When it was time to act,
you got scared.

1776
02:07:00,633 --> 02:07:04,466
One needs courage to do
what I am doing.

1777
02:07:05,100 --> 02:07:08,100
Chaudhary knows Dimpy loves you.

1778
02:07:08,466 --> 02:07:10,233
Still he's getting her
married to Rajjo.

1779
02:07:10,366 --> 02:07:11,766
This is wrong.

1780
02:07:13,033 --> 02:07:14,633
Fathers are not always wrong.

1781
02:07:31,433 --> 02:07:34,433
Love commando.
Where are you going?

1782
02:07:34,566 --> 02:07:36,466
As soon as I got the news
that you were here...

1783
02:07:36,600 --> 02:07:38,533
...I came here to welcome
you personally.

1784
02:07:39,733 --> 02:07:42,133
You came here to attend
Rajjo's wedding, didn't you?

1785
02:07:42,266 --> 02:07:43,600
So you've got to have something.

1786
02:07:44,633 --> 02:07:45,700
Choose one.

1787
02:07:46,266 --> 02:07:49,566
What would you like
to have, this or this?

1788
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Please let us go.

1789
02:07:51,133 --> 02:07:53,166
This time, you won't
leave this place alive.

1790
02:07:54,233 --> 02:07:55,700
You've come unprepared.

1791
02:07:56,033 --> 02:07:57,600
You've got only
three boys with you.

1792
02:07:58,333 --> 02:07:59,466
Kill him!

1793
02:08:01,466 --> 02:08:02,633
Let him go!

1794
02:08:02,766 --> 02:08:04,366
Don't beat him!

1795
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:05,700
Bablu!

1796
02:08:07,100 --> 02:08:08,133
Bablu!

1797
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:15,633
Bablu!

1798
02:08:16,066 --> 02:08:19,033
Please spare him!
Please let him go.

1799
02:08:25,233 --> 02:08:26,433
Bablu!

1800
02:08:29,666 --> 02:08:31,633
-Bablu!
-Where's all the attitude you had?

1801
02:08:54,533 --> 02:08:57,233
That's it?
Where's all the attitude you had?

1802
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:59,400
I'll put an end to you here.

1803
02:08:59,533 --> 02:09:02,133
And back there, it'll be
Dimpy's opening ceremony.

1804
02:09:14,766 --> 02:09:16,233
You....

1805
02:10:15,166 --> 02:10:17,133
-Bablu, kill him.
-Beat him.

1806
02:10:17,266 --> 02:10:19,366
-Bablu, beat him up.
-Don't spare him.

1807
02:10:20,266 --> 02:10:21,733
Beat him.

1808
02:10:22,233 --> 02:10:25,100
Bablu, kill him.
Finish him off.

1809
02:10:25,433 --> 02:10:27,766
Finish him off!

1810
02:10:55,466 --> 02:10:56,533
Stop!

1811
02:11:08,766 --> 02:11:10,033
Mr. Chaudhary--

1812
02:11:13,666 --> 02:11:15,133
What's so special about you?

1813
02:11:16,266 --> 02:11:19,066
Why does Dimpy love you?
I can't understand.

1814
02:11:21,133 --> 02:11:22,600
The wedding procession
is at the gate...

1815
02:11:22,733 --> 02:11:24,266
...but I'm standing here.

1816
02:11:24,766 --> 02:11:26,200
Why?

1817
02:11:27,533 --> 02:11:29,533
Because you love
your daughter a lot.

1818
02:11:31,433 --> 02:11:33,233
I don't want to
take away your right...

1819
02:11:34,100 --> 02:11:35,700
...to decide whom she marries.

1820
02:11:37,466 --> 02:11:39,166
If her future husband...

1821
02:11:40,466 --> 02:11:42,266
...troubles her in any way...

1822
02:11:44,366 --> 02:11:45,733
...I won't spare you.

1823
02:11:50,666 --> 02:11:57,133
If her future husband
troubles her in any way...

1824
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:00,266
...I won't spare you.

1825
02:12:10,500 --> 02:12:11,533
Go on.

1826
02:12:12,766 --> 02:12:14,200
Take her away.

1827
02:12:57,200 --> 02:12:59,166
Brother, what about
our family honor?

1828
02:12:59,300 --> 02:13:02,266
I just want to see respect
in Dimpy's eyes.

1829
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:05,200
You mean love marriages
are okay in the Jat Land?

1830
02:13:05,333 --> 02:13:07,600
If the boy is worthy,
then we don't have a problem.

1831
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:13,166
Brother,
I am having an affair too.

1832
02:13:14,100 --> 02:13:16,033
-Me too, sir.
-Sukhi, you....

1833
02:13:21,433 --> 02:13:22,733
Bless you, son.

1834
02:13:24,766 --> 02:13:26,500
Please forgive Rakesh
and Renu too.

1835
02:13:26,633 --> 02:13:28,033
Yes.

1836
02:13:28,666 --> 02:13:30,533
So you got a hero attitude.

1837
02:13:31,533 --> 02:13:32,666
I can't help it.

1838
02:13:33,066 --> 02:13:35,533
Others don't have it
and I can't lose it.

1839
02:13:46,066 --> 02:13:47,700
This is the kiss song

1840
02:13:49,566 --> 02:13:51,366
This is the kiss song

1841
02:13:53,233 --> 02:13:55,100

This is the kiss song

1846
02:14:19,766 --> 02:14:21,400
Anything will do
Black or white

1847
02:14:21,533 --> 02:14:23,366
Anywhere will do
Left or right

1848
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:26,733
Let's not fight
For the season of love is here

1849
02:14:27,066 --> 02:14:30,366
Set your lips
And wet both the cheeks

1850
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:34,200
Give a kiss to get one in return
For this season of love

1851
02:14:34,333 --> 02:14:37,733
Don't be so sad, sad
It's time to be happy

1852
02:14:38,033 --> 02:14:41,433
If you're feeling bad, bad
Come and take a free kiss

1853
02:14:41,566 --> 02:14:45,266
Don't be so sad, sad
It's time to be happy

1854
02:14:45,400 --> 02:14:49,066

If you're feeling bad, bad
Come and take a free kiss

1862
02:15:21,200 --> 02:15:24,766
I've washed my face
And cleaned my cheeks

1863
02:15:25,066 --> 02:15:28,400
Give me a kiss
And bring pink to my cheeks

1864
02:15:28,533 --> 02:15:31,733
Dry or wet kiss
Give me a kiss and make my life

1865
02:15:32,033 --> 02:15:35,566
The coast is clear, so play
You know what I mean

1866
02:15:35,700 --> 02:15:39,233
What is the scene?
What are you waiting for?

1867
02:15:39,366 --> 02:15:42,700
Making me wait
Why don't you kiss me now?

1868
02:15:43,066 --> 02:15:46,233
Are you upset with me
Or do you got an attitude?

1869
02:15:46,366 --> 02:15:50,066
Why do you giggle
And have all the fun?

1870
02:15:50,200 --> 02:15:51,700
