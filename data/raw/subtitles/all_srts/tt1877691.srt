1
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:05,083
I can't imagine the
face of the idiot...

2
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,333
who once said...

3
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,458
OPPOSITES ATTRACT!!

4
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:13,083
I guess some of you out
there did fall for that logic

5
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,917
But we didn't...

6
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,000
and this is our story.

7
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:42,042
"Each moment is young and
beautiful."

8
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:46,500
"There is no sorrow when I am
there."

9
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,750
"Life is filled with joy."

10
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,750
"This is how I live."

11
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,333
"Each morning brings light."

12
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:04,208
"Each evening brings beauty."

13
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,625
"Life is awakened."

14
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,792
"This is the song that life
sings."

15
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:12,333
"Everyday life is awakened."

16
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:18,042
"There are showers of colors.
There are graces."

17
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:26,708
"There are showers
of colors every day."

18
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:38,333
"My heart feels like
smiling all the time."

19
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:43,625
"And humming a tune slowly."

20
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:47,458
"Whomever I met I
considered him my friend."

21
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:52,833
"Life is a celebration."

22
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:57,125
"Whatever I heard I
considered it good news."

23
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:01,042
"I recognized joy every day."

24
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:05,583
"Each morning brings light."

25
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:10,583
"Each evening brings beauty."

26
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:15,167
"This is my story. This is my
life."

27
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:19,208
"This is my story every day."

28
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,333
"There are showers of colors.
There are graces."

29
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:33,542
"There are showers
of colors every day."

30
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:10,250
Boss has given it.
He wants light effect.

31
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,458
Shit! Govind, how could I
forget!

32
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,708
Forget what?

33
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,333
Today is Valentine's Day.

34
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:24,792
Relax, bro... she
doesn't know that you forgot.

35
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,125
You have enough time.

36
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:28,333
Plan something special for her.

37
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,500
Good idea!

38
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,750
What should I do?

39
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:42,500
Jai you know very well that
I have been divorced twice

40
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:45,958
I've been on three dates
in the past three months!

41
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,083
They've all been pretty boring.

42
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,542
Do I look like the guy with
a special plan up his sleeve?

43
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:54,833
Govind, you know how she is!

44
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,042
Come on, you're my friend!

45
00:05:57,042 --> 00:05:59,583
You have to help me think
of something... anything.

46
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,333
No, no

47
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,083
Great. Some help.

48
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:23,875
"Like fragrance in flowers.
And colors in buds."

49
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:29,167
"I have the zest to live."

50
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:33,000
"There is resonance of hopes."

51
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,167
"There is a zest in my
heart all the time."

52
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:42,625
"The world of dreams is
familiar."

53
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,417
"I weave a new dream every day."

54
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:50,875
"Each morning brings light."

55
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:55,792
"Each evening brings beauty."

56
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:58,250
"This is the spectacle."

57
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,583
"Each moment is filled with
hope."

58
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:04,833
"This is the spectacle every
day."

59
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,375
"There are showers of colors."

60
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,708
"There are graces."

61
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:18,542
"There are showers
of colors every day."

62
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:29,042
Hi. Happy Valentine's Day.

63
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:30,458
Same to you.

64
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,167
This is for you.

65
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:34,417
Thank you.

66
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:36,708
This is for me?
- Yes!

67
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,667
Happy Valentine..

68
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,042
Hello.
- How are you, Jai?

69
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:47,375
Hi mom!

70
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,708
Well... do you like it?

71
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,875
It's a guitar.

72
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,167
Yes!

73
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:57,667
Naina you know I cant even
sing happy birthday in tune

74
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:59,667
I don't know how to
play the guitar, love.

75
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,500
I have ingestion today.

76
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,375
Mom, why aren't you having
those organic vegetables?

77
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:10,250
It's not available.
- At least wash it in potassium.

78
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,625
Nowadays it is very chlorine.
- Yes.

79
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,417
Listen, will you talk to your
aunt?
- Surely.

80
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:17,792
I have to take this.

81
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:20,167
As if you have the
time to teach me to play.

82
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,417
Hello. Yes..

83
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:27,417
Oh no, we're having dinner at
home.

84
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:31,083
Listen, talk to your aunty.
- Okay.

85
00:08:33,832 --> 00:08:35,207
Sorry!

86
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,875
It's okay. Greetings aunty-ji.

87
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,333
How are you?

88
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:42,832
Very well, how are you?

89
00:08:42,832 --> 00:08:45,333
What's the special gift?

90
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:49,083
Well... he has
prepared a fabulous dinner.

91
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,167
I almost forgot.

92
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,083
Your gift.

93
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:06,625
Oh my God! They are beautiful.

94
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,042
Next time you can expect a
necklace.

95
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,833
as soon as this deal comes
through.

96
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,292
But these must be very
expensive.

97
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:15,625
So? You're worth it.

98
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,208
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

99
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,625
You've been saying it for
months.

100
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,750
Okay, I will talk to
you about this next time.

101
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,625
Put aunty on line, mom.

102
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,125
Hello aunty-ji, how are you?

103
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,625
You find it amusing, huh?

104
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,708
You know it's quite logical.

105
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:55,208
I don't think your mom is wrong.

106
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,292
Tell me, why aren't
you getting married?

107
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,167
You want the truth...

108
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,083
I haven't heard that
loud bell in my heart

109
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,250
Bell? What's a bell
got to do with marriage?

110
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,333
I know Radhika is great...

111
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,083
she is beautiful, smart,
intelligent.

112
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,583
And I guess successful too.

113
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,625
Actually, she is a lot
more successful than you.

114
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:22,292
Anyway.
- I don't know, man!

115
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:25,958
It takes a few years of
marriage
for couples to get to where we are.

116
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,333
You know what I mean.

117
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,208
Well... I mean...

118
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:35,875
for example, you and Nandini.

119
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,833
Remember that life?

120
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,917
What's the word for it...
it's...

121
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:42,708
boring?
- Boring!

122
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:48,042
Bland, regular,
like a routine, you know!

123
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:49,417
I understand.

124
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:51,417
But why do you understand?

125
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:55,792
It's because you did
things differently.

126
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:58,792
You priorities were different.

127
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,333
God forbid, Govind if...

128
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,542
I get... I get it, Jai.

129
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:06,167
It was my marriage,
I was there, I get it.

130
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,375
Sorry!
- That's fine.

131
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,083
That's not what I meant.

132
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:14,417
But just imagine. And trust me.

133
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:17,625
Its good she left you

134
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:21,750
I mean you left her

135
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,000
It's fine, dude.

136
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,708
It didn't work.

137
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,250
How does it matter who left
whom?

138
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,083
Well sometimes even I forget.

139
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:42,000
I miss the energy, the good
times...

140
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,833
The college days, the
single and ready to mingle days.

141
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,167
I wonder if I will
ever feel that way again.

142
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:56,875
The excitement, the magic
that fills up your heart.

143
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,292
Bell! Ding dong Bell bro!

144
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:01,833
Relax bro... You'll hear it

145
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,208
But when?

146
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:11,167
But Jai, it's your fault.
Why don't you talk to Radhika?

147
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,542
Talk to Radhika?

148
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,958
There is no talking to radhika.
There is only listening to
Radhika

149
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:28,833
And a discussion about this?
She could kill me.

150
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:31,875
She is quite psycho.
- Yeah, a bit.

151
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:39,208
What? Power failure in Mumbai?

152
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,625
Oh no! The rest of my
ice-cream will melt!

153
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,333
If the ice-cream melts
you will die, right?

154
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:49,375
Trust me, Naina. Ice cream is
the best cure for a break-up.

155
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:53,542
The best cure for a
break-up is also a patch up,
Ritu.

156
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:57,708
Why don't you speak with Kunal?
He has apologised a million
times.

157
00:12:57,792 --> 00:13:03,333
Saying sorry comes easy but
being faithful is the difficult
part.

158
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:08,042
But what did he do?

159
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,333
One silly sms...

160
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:14,125
He did nothing
because I had read his sms.

161
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,458
I can't imagine what he
would've done otherwise.

162
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:17,917
And you tell me...

163
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:21,417
How long does it take these
days for an SMS to become an
MMS ?

164
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,000
The point is there is no mms.

165
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,792
You are overacting... a little
bit.

166
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:28,083
Don't you worry, Jai.

167
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:32,417
I tell you honestly, our
generation's
number 1 problem is this.

168
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:34,375
Radhika?

169
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:38,000
Relationships, man. - Yes.
- Relationships. - Right.

170
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,417
Everyone's in a mess. You know
that.

171
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:43,417
Now you want to smoke this?

172
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,542
No!

173
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,750
Throw it away. You'll die
if you continue smoking.

174
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,083
Come on. Let's go now.

175
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,542
Come on, our manager
must be waiting for us.

176
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:54,917
To hell with him! Project
report!

177
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:59,833
You know... can't live with
them...

178
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:04,708
Hello. - Hi. - Can't live
without them. - Correct. -
Let's go!

179
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:08,292
You know, yesterday she was
checking my nails. - Please.

180
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:09,917
You miss him, don't you?

181
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,625
A lot.

182
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,208
Well... it is said that
time heals everything.

183
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,375
Perhaps one day you will
forgive him.

184
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:34,667
Until then you have
ice cream. Indulge in it!

185
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:38,458
I hope I don't run out of
flavours!

186
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,625
Naughty! Stupid!

187
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,750
Are you taking guitar lessons?

188
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,833
It was a gift meant for Dhruv..

189
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,833
.. but I guess now
I'll have to take lessons.

190
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,667
Men are the same everywhere.

191
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:57,750
Yet we dream of
spending our lives with them.

192
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,917
That reminds me
Gayatri is getting married.

193
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:03,667
Really? Wow! What is
the name of the guy?

194
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:08,208
Arjun, really nice guy.
She is very happy.

195
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,417
Are you going for it?
- Of course!

196
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:11,667
You should come along.

197
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:15,667
Apparently you meet some
good guys at weddings.

198
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,958
Chandigarh. For marriage?
Come on, Jai.

199
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:25,833
I thought if you don't come
along,
it won't be half as fun.

200
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:29,417
Actually it won't be any fun.

201
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:32,792
Please Jai! Can you see how
much work I have on my head?

202
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,667
Tomorrow morning is the
seminar,
it's going to be very hard.

203
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,250
You mean you really can't...
you swear you can't?

204
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,583
Are you really going
to miss me that much?

205
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,917
I swear.

206
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,417
Fine, I'll figure something.

207
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:50,417
It won't be easy but
I'll try to make it.

208
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:55,750
Radhika, I think I'm putting
you under a lot of pressure.

209
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:00,833
You are so honest and hard
working and I'm plain selfish.

210
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,083
It's ridiculous.

211
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,125
No, Jai, it's fine. I'll sort
it out.

212
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,375
No, it's okay. I'll go alone.

213
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,625
Jai, listen to me...

214
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:11,375
No, Radhika, I
shouldn't bear on your work.

215
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,333
Please, I swear.

216
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,042
Really?

217
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,667
Yeah.

218
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,542
That's so sweet of you.

219
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:25,917
So, what is it?

220
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:28,000
Govind, Radhika is...

221
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,500
Damn! Here we go again.

222
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,542
Radhika-isn't-coming...

223
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,833
What are you talking...
you are joking?

224
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,667
You know I get stressed very
easily.

225
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,833
Keep it down or she'll hear us.

226
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,250
Touchwood! This is great news,
pal.

227
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,542
I was craving a vacation.
I need a break, it's too much.

228
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:47,833
We're taking a vacation,
brother!

229
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,750
What are you doing?
- I don't know. - Let's go!

230
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,625
I still need to pack the
magazines!

231
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,750
Good morning, ma'am. Your
flight
to Delhi is on time. - Thank you.

232
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:09,832
You expect me to carry
this bag? It's so heavy!

233
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,791
Naina?

234
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,249
Yeah!

235
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,582
How did you know?

236
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,541
Magic.

237
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,000
Just kidding!

238
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,416
Arjun said you'll be
travelling with us.

239
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,791
So he asked me to look out for
you.

240
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,500
And I've been asking every
single girl the same thing!

241
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,208
Naina?

242
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,333
The bus isn't here yet?

243
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,542
The bus is here and so are the
guests.

244
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,375
We were waiting for you.

245
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,500
It's over there.

246
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,542
Okay. Phone!

247
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:46,833
Yeah!

248
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,167
I am sorry, Dhruv.

249
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,542
You have to make it.

250
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:54,750
You can't miss the "sangeet"
ceremony.

251
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,167
Okay, bye!

252
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,250
Sorry, they're heavy.

253
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,833
No, no, not at all. It's fine.

254
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,750
Come on.

255
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:19,250
"We don't start a fight."

256
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:23,167
"Every day and night
we try to fight."

257
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:26,500
Jai, would you please
look over my bag for me?

258
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,333
I will just come.
- Yes, sure.

259
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,833
Now we also know
each other very well.

260
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:38,000
I mean, your bags are
quite heavy... quite some time.

261
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
We spent quite some time
together.

262
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,375
Do you always crack such jokes?

263
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:49,000
Yes. Why? Would you
prefer some other type?

264
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,375
You could try.

265
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:54,000
Really? Any particular type?

266
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,292
For example, jokes
people can actually laugh at.

267
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,250
Dude! Beautiful girl-one,
Jai-zero!

268
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,958
By the way did you hear a bell?

269
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,042
Just sit down! Nobody
asked for your expert advice.

270
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:15,625
But your jokes sure
were a class apart!

271
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:26,917
"Look, the paths are
calling out to us."

272
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:32,417
"We are walking without
thinking."

273
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:37,250
"I am thinking this is
where I want to be."

274
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:42,083
"Beloved, meet me someday."

275
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:45,708
I can't wait to get
to Chandigarh, man.

276
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,792
Sir, the engine needs to cool
down.

277
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:50,417
We'll go and some water. Let's
go.

278
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:51,667
Why is he yelling?

279
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:53,958
Forget it. Here, everybody
yells.

280
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,458
What's wrong?

281
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:59,417
Nothing, the engine needs to
cool
down. Should take a few minutes.

282
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,083
Okay, I'll be right back.

283
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,500
Hello... where do
you think you're going?

284
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,958
The restroom in the bus is a
mess

285
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:15,292
So don't go alone.
We'll come along. Right?

286
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:18,458
No, it's okay. I am fine,
really!

287
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:22,750
Naina, it's a jungle.
It's not safe out here.

288
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,083
What say, Govind?

289
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,750
I mean... it's safe but...
we should go.

290
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:29,417
We should go!

291
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:31,833
Then you hold onto this.

292
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,750
Thanks!

293
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:47,750
What?
- Look at you...

294
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,458
matching!
- So?

295
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,750
It's amazing.

296
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,417
She made you a
porter as soon as you met.

297
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:01,208
And now both of us are
standing here as security
guards.

298
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,667
By the time we get to
Chandigarh...

299
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:05,000
Then what?

300
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:06,542
Come on...

301
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:10,875
You know Govind, I
just realised something.

302
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,833
You have become very negative.

303
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:14,500
Be positive, brother!

304
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:19,125
We are on a vacation,
remember the trip has just
begun.

305
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:23,875
There's lots of good
stuff in store for us.

306
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:29,292
Really? Good stuff... like what?

307
00:21:29,292 --> 00:21:33,708
Guys, can please sing a song?

308
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,958
This is really weird!

309
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,875
Sing!

310
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:45,750
"Life is a beautiful journey."

311
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:52,500
"Nobody knows what will
happen in the future." - Louder!

312
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:04,625
"Understand what the gestures
say."

313
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:10,167
"Listen. Everybody is
calling to us from the heart."

314
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:14,667
"I am thinking this is
where I want to be."

315
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:19,083
"Beloved, meet me someday."

316
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:22,208
Start.

317
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,958
Come on.

318
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:27,958
Gayatri.

319
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:57,208
Great, you can take
them to the hotel.

320
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,667
If you need something call me,
okay?

321
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:01,625
Don't worry. I am there.

322
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:05,083
Arjun, I still can't believe
that..

323
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,792
..you and Gayatri
are getting married.

324
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,833
It's amazing! Time flies, man!

325
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:14,542
You know actually she's quite
hot.

326
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:18,375
Govind, have some respect.

327
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:22,875
What's disrespectful about that?

328
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,458
She is hot, so she is!

329
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:28,458
Shut up man, don't
talk nonsense. Keep quiet.

330
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,667
What's wrong with you?

331
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:34,792
If a girl is gorgeous you
can use other adjectives too...

332
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:36,042
like hot, sexy, cute... you
know.

333
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:37,292
Just shut up!

334
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:40,042
Are you mad? Have you lost it?
I'd rather not talk to you.

335
00:23:40,042 --> 00:23:42,833
Let me ask Arjun. You
don't have a problem..

336
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,750
..if I refer to her as
hot and sexy, do you?

337
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,250
I mean, in a nice way.

338
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,708
But actually,
Govind, there is a problem.

339
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:51,292
Yeah! She is quite reserved.

340
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:53,750
You don't know her very well.

341
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,667
You know... besides Gayatri
is like your sister-in-law.

342
00:23:57,667 --> 00:23:59,208
- Correct! - Gayatri?

343
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,625
Where did she come from? I
wasn't talking about her.

344
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:04,042
I was talking about her friend
..

345
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,208
..and Mr. Ding Dong
Bell here sang for her.

346
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,250
Drat! You mean Naina?

347
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,792
-Naina!
- She is hot.

348
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:11,583
That's what I said.
- Brother, she is hot!

349
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:12,917
- I told you so! - She is hot!

350
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:20,292
Guys... what do you
think of Gayatri? I mean...

351
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:21,833
Jai, tell him.

352
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:24,500
She's good, very sweet.

353
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,750
Aunty and uncle will
love her. Right, Govind?

354
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,792
Of course! Can I get some
water...
my throat's parched.

355
00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:32,958
I know that. But do
you think she is hot?

356
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,583
I mean 'hot'?

357
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,500
Answer him, Jai.

358
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:45,792
She is sweet, she is nice.
What say, Govind?

359
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:48,042
Oh no, nice won't do.

360
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:50,250
What's his question?
Arjun asked if she is hot.

361
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,625
Do you think Gayatri is hot?
- Hot!

362
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:59,000
God Gayatri! We've been
discussing
your marriage for ages now.

363
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,417
We haven't, you have been.

364
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:03,458
You've been discussing my
marriage
since you were in the 6th grade.

365
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,083
So cute!

366
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:06,792
But just imagine.

367
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:12,250
Now each day will begin
and end with Arjun for you.

368
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:15,167
It's perfect.

369
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,875
I know!

370
00:25:17,042 --> 00:25:19,625
So we've decided that
Naina is hot, right?

371
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:22,083
And Gayatri isn't
that what you're saying?

372
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:25,125
- Answer him! - Yeah!

373
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:31,042
He is speechless.
- Speechless.

374
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:41,250
Alok, how're you doing?

375
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,292
You look very smart!

376
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,458
Hello.
- Hello.

377
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,333
Where's Biji?

378
00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:51,708
Sexy.

379
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:58,458
Bloody Mary.

380
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:01,125
Arjun, I want to see Biji.

381
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,042
Hurry up.
- Quick. - Thank you.

382
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:07,292
Nice, huh?

383
00:26:07,292 --> 00:26:09,292
The combo is unbelievable.

384
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:12,667
Greetings Biji, guess who is
here.

385
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:15,250
How are you, Biji?

386
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:18,792
- Greetings to you. - Bless you!

387
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:23,333
I hope you are ready with a
sizzling
performance for the "sangeet".

388
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,000
Like the 'Infamous Munni'!

389
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Idiot! This Munni isn't
infamous,
she is sick.

390
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,250
You are shameless. On the phone
you keep saying you'll visit me.

391
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,500
I got caught up with work, Biji.

392
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,375
Is it work or a beautiful girl?

393
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:41,875
Greetings Biji!

394
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:47,500
I can't help it. You helped
your grandson Arjun find a girl.

395
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,417
You don't care about me.

396
00:26:49,417 --> 00:26:54,917
Well that's because I am sure
that
you will find a girl for yourself.

397
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:58,167
So, how's the lady of the house?

398
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:00,542
Have you'll decided on
something?

399
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:03,500
Well the thing is... you see...

400
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,458
I, what do you say?
- Biji, he hasn't heard the
bell yet!

401
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:11,500
That's good. There's still some
hope.

402
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,792
You are so naughty! Can't
wait for your performance.

403
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:22,583
I'd love to dance but the
doctor's advice is, 'Just
Chill'.

404
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:24,417
To hell with the doctor!

405
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:29,083
I would only if he
weren't Arjun's dad.

406
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:31,875
Arjun, my sweetie pie!

407
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:36,833
You look happy, Biji,
finally you are smiling.

408
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:41,125
This is Naina, Gayatri's best
friend.

409
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:46,000
She is gorgeous, just like
Gayatri.

410
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,625
Are you married?

411
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,333
No.

412
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:55,208
What's wrong with
the boys these days!

413
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:59,625
Such a beautiful girl
and she isn't married yet.

414
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:03,375
Biji, Naina has a boyfriend.
His name is Dhruv.

415
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:04,792
Is he here with you?

416
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,750
No, he is caught up with work.

417
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,333
What's the use of such a
boyfriend?
That's just like Jai.

418
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:12,917
I suggest you keep your eyes
open..

419
00:28:12,917 --> 00:28:16,375
..you will find
someone as sweet as Naina.

420
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:20,250
Okay then! I think
you should rest now.

421
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:22,333
Let's freshen up, Arjun?

422
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,583
Let me show you to your room.

423
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:26,667
Bye, Biji.
- Yes, son.

424
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:28,417
Love you, sexy.
- Go and rest.

425
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:06,917
Fritters are ready.

426
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:09,875
Thanks.
- There is some..

427
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:11,417
You haven't changed a bit!

428
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,500
That's true.

429
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:17,250
Thanks pal for waking me up!

430
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:24,167
It gives me joy to wake you up,
to bring you tea in bed...

431
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:26,042
Obviously. - And probably
even massage your feet.

432
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:29,167
Correct!
- No problem, come on.

433
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,667
I'm starving.

434
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:35,958
Too late! Buffet is over,
but there's lots of beer.

435
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:46,375
Of course, I can see that
but it's also good to share.

436
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:49,208
What have you all decided
for the pre wedding party?

437
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:50,500
It's simple, dude

438
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:57,625
Vodka, Bacardi, some wine,
if you insist. That's all, bro.

439
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:06,167
Drinks apart other things are
necessary for an entertainment
value.

440
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:09,500
But thanks.
- Very well!

441
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:13,458
From the outside you are Dr.
Jekyll but you really are Mr.
Hyde!

442
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:16,667
What?
- What a pleasant surprise!

443
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:23,042
So, what do you have
in mind, like Russians?

444
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:28,750
Russians at home? Jai,
do something, please!

445
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,667
Ignore him! So what were you
saying?

446
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:32,375
Well, we were thinking that ..

447
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:35,333
..the 'boys versus
girls' competition is passÃ©.

448
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,875
I agree! But the boys'
side is always the best.

449
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:40,125
- Right, Arjun? - Absolutely!

450
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:42,625
What rubbish! You don't
stand a chance against us!

451
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:44,708
I see.
- What say, Naina?

452
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:47,208
Absolutely! You can
try us out anytime.

453
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:49,958
Probably another day.

454
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,250
And it's our favourite song.

455
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,417
No, no, Gayatri!

456
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:01,042
How filmy can you be! Come on!

457
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:03,333
I think it's rather sweet.

458
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:06,958
Exactly. - It's their
wedding and their performance.

459
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:09,125
I think we should do it. Let's
do it.

460
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,542
I think you should
call for some more vodka.

461
00:31:12,542 --> 00:31:14,583
This is turning into
a "Hum Aapke Hain Kaun" sequel.

462
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,708
That's jasmine! Do you smell
jasmine?

463
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:23,292
It must be aunt Sheila.

464
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,000
Hi aunt Sheila.

465
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,917
Hello...

466
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:29,750
Welcome!

467
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:31,167
- How are you? - Great!

468
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:34,208
Nice to see you. Hello...

469
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:37,250
How nice of you to show up.
You're a day late!

470
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:41,250
About time you got married.
She's been waiting for years.

471
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:45,083
Anyway, you know how I
love weddings. I just love it.

472
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:49,167
The questions fielded by
the aunts and uncles...

473
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,292
it takes a while to prepare
yourself.

474
00:31:51,292 --> 00:31:55,417
Everyone present here knows you
don't want to marry. So relax.

475
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:56,667
Where's uncle?

476
00:31:56,667 --> 00:32:00,458
He needs even more time to
prepare himself, you know!

477
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:07,958
Now come on, I have to
show you something. - What?

478
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,417
- Let's go. - Okay.

479
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,750
Hello Soniaji, this is Sheila.

480
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,167
Hi.
- Hi. Very close to the family.

481
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:32,167
She's like a younger sister to
me.

482
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:33,458
Nice to meet you.

483
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:35,917
You teach Urdu, don't you?
- Yes. Yes.

484
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:39,125
I have heard a lot about you.
- Shall we go?

485
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:51,250
I'm really sorry.

486
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:54,792
I suppose you are
inconvenienced by my arrival.

487
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:58,042
Sorry? Of course.

488
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:02,792
Everyone's excited since
they are meeting after ages.

489
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:06,083
Govind.
- Sheila.

490
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:10,583
Aren't you performing with
the others at the "sangeet"?

491
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:13,042
Dancing is fun.

492
00:33:13,417 --> 00:33:14,833
Well... nobody asked.

493
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,292
Really? That's shocking!

494
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,667
Alright, this stuff is very
simple.

495
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:22,750
Everyone will take a
chit from this bowl.

496
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,042
Boys will take yellow and girls
red.

497
00:33:25,042 --> 00:33:26,292
And what about green?

498
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:27,708
There is no green here.
- Okay.

499
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:29,875
People with the same number..

500
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,458
.. will be partners at
the "sangeet" ceremony.

501
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:34,375
Boys... girls... are you ready?

502
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:36,583
Yes, of course!
- Cool.

503
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:38,250
Good luck. Now pick up the chit.

504
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,083
Ladies first.

505
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:41,375
Yeah, what is this?

506
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:43,042
Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

507
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:45,958
These chits are scary.

508
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:52,083
I hoping for the right partner.
- I agree.

509
00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:56,000
Boys.
- Come on. - What a masculine
colour!

510
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,417
Great, Pinku has taken two!

511
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:59,042
Two.

512
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:03,167
Now open your chits and
say the number out loud.

513
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,833
Nikki, we will start with you.

514
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:08,583
It's two...

515
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:13,250
Two.
- Two. - Tow. I've got two!

516
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:18,250
I'm a... four.

517
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:24,000
-Oh... I'm a...
- I'm four!

518
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:25,625
And that means you are three.

519
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:26,917
Correct! I am three.

520
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:29,375
Don't know what I was thinking.

521
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,375
I'm three.

522
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:36,500
Just imagine... partners!

523
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:41,083
Yeah.
- Naina, that means you are
three.

524
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:42,958
Yes.
- You are three. - Yes. - Okay.

525
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:46,125
How surprising... just imagine.

526
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,500
Yes, partners. Let's
begin the rehearsal.

527
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,667
No, that's for tomorrow.
It's all planned.

528
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:54,417
It will be fun.
- Okay. And now?

529
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:58,792
Now all of you can quickly
freshen up for dinner. Don't be
late!

530
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:01,625
Yes.
- Alright. - Yes. - Bye, aunt.

531
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:03,542
Dad, come on! Let's go.

532
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:06,833
"Your kohl eyes look beautiful."

533
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:09,083
"An innocent boy got enticed."

534
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:11,375
"When you turned and looked
behind."

535
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,917
"I fell in love with you."

536
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:17,250
"I fell in love with you."

537
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,708
Naina... Naina, wait up!

538
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:22,958
- Hey partner! - Hi Jai.

539
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:24,542
You are looking very nice.

540
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,042
I know!

541
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:30,458
Where's Govind?

542
00:35:30,917 --> 00:35:32,583
Getting dressed I guess.

543
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,875
Nice guy.

544
00:35:38,042 --> 00:35:41,375
Since when do you know Gayatri.

545
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:43,333
We went to boarding school
together.

546
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:44,833
Best friends then.

547
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:46,208
And now?

548
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:50,208
We're still very
close but as you know...

549
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:54,000
- she's a Delhi girl. - And
soon to be a Chandigarh girl.

550
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,833
Right. And I live in Bombay.

551
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:59,542
So are you a Maharashtrian?

552
00:35:59,542 --> 00:36:00,917
My dad was.

553
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,458
Sorry.

554
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:09,375
No, not about being
Maharashtrian,
of course. The "was" part.

555
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,292
It's okay.

556
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:15,083
Actually, you and me
have that in common.

557
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:18,542
Really? Your father
is also Maharashtrian?

558
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:24,333
No, dad was a Punjabi.
Was being the common part

559
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:26,708
I am sorry.

560
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:28,042
It's okay.

561
00:36:28,917 --> 00:36:30,542
Hey... Jai wait!

562
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:32,292
- Hi... - There you are!

563
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:35,000
Are we practicing today?
The engagement isn't today?

564
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,917
- Let's go. - Yes, let's!

565
00:36:36,917 --> 00:36:39,083
There are so many functions,
it's difficult to keep track.

566
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:41,708
Oh wow!
- Wow!

567
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:44,208
Wow! This is so beautiful.

568
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:46,458
I'm sure Arjun has nothing to
do
with this. He is colour blind.

569
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,167
We're going to have a great
time.
- Naina. Naina, come here.

570
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:58,708
Look. Okay, I'll see you later.
Bye.

571
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:00,333
- Hi... - Hello..

572
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:01,542
This one?

573
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:04,792
Tonight is going to be a good
night.

574
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:07,292
It's going to be a great night.

575
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:10,458
Which one do you think?
- I think this one.

576
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:12,750
Hi.
- Hold on.

577
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:18,417
Govind, she said hi.

578
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:19,792
Show me.
- See this.

579
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:26,292
Usually people wave back.

580
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:29,125
I should say hi...

581
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:30,625
Yes, I should reply.

582
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,375
Yes. I will have to see
when I find out. - Yes.

583
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:38,292
You like to..

584
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,250
Hello Sheila.

585
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,583
Hi.

586
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:45,125
How are you?
- I'm fine.

587
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:46,958
How are you?
- Good.

588
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,875
You're wearing a jasmine
perfume?
- Yes...

589
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:55,125
It's really nice.
- Thank you.

590
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:57,708
Okay.
- Okay...

591
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:07,708
Cool? Happy?
- I'm sure auntie Sheila is.

592
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:09,083
It's Sheila!

593
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:11,833
Auntie Sheila.

594
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:13,667
It's Sheila!

595
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,917
Are you and Arjun brothers?
- No.

596
00:38:16,917 --> 00:38:18,667
Are you cousins?
- No.

597
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:20,792
Are you a distant relative?
- Of course not!

598
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:25,458
So then She is Arjun's aunt.
Why
should we call her auntie Sheila?

599
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:27,625
Have some respect
for her feelings, dude.

600
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:30,458
Will you like it if
everyone called you uncle?

601
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:31,750
Well no... not if I'm 40.

602
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,958
- She is 38. Thirty eight!
- What 38?

603
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:35,583
Sheila is 38.

604
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:40,042
Wow! Big difference.

605
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:43,292
It is a big difference, Jai.

606
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:46,000
A lot can happen in two years.

607
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:48,042
Two years ago, I was married...

608
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:50,667
while you were fluttering
around like a butterfly.

609
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:53,542
Two years later, I'm single...

610
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,208
Bro, according to your mom,
you should be married!

611
00:38:57,708 --> 00:39:01,542
Radhika misses you. Think about
it.

612
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:06,042
Why are you getting personal?
- Thanks, uncle!

613
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:24,917
Asshole.

614
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:37,208
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have you attention please.

615
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,417
Woo-hoo!

616
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:42,625
Thank you, thank you...

617
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:45,250
Thanks dad... sorry, dads!

618
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,833
No, go ahead Arjun,
this is your day.

619
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:55,167
I'd like to say something...
to Gayatri.

620
00:39:56,792 --> 00:39:59,208
It was during my 7th grade
vacation..

621
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:00,667
..that I went to my
grandmother's place and...

622
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:03,417
..that's when I saw
Gayatri for the very first time.

623
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:07,125
She was in the home
opposite ours and...

624
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:11,417
..along with her friends she
was trying to steal ice cream.

625
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:16,750
I don't think she was
successful
and I know this sounds very filmy...

626
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:24,875
..but that day in her little
pink frock, she stole my heart.

627
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:26,292
Wow!

628
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:34,625
And, today after 14 years of
innumerable breakups and
patch-ups...

629
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:36,417
I'm going to return the favour!

630
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:41,917
I am finally stealing Gayatri
away from all of you. Forever.

631
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:44,208
Sorry everyone!

632
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,333
Congratulations!

633
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:40,750
"Lord is the savior."

634
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:43,375
"Lord is the savior."

635
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:48,542
"Lord is the savior."

636
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:51,500
"Lord is the savior."

637
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,250
"Lord is the savior."

638
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:59,833
"Lord is the savior."

639
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:05,417
"This ambiance of joy."

640
00:42:05,417 --> 00:42:10,792
"Clarion is resonating in my
heart."

641
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:16,292
"This ambiance of joy."

642
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:22,125
"Clarion is resonating in my
heart."

643
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:27,667
"This beautiful beloved."

644
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:32,500
"It's the story of love."

645
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,333
"Lord is the savior."

646
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:37,917
"Lord is the savior."

647
00:42:37,917 --> 00:42:42,208
"Lord is the savior."

648
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:46,167
"Lord is the savior."

649
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:48,750
"Lord is the savior."

650
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:53,708
"Lord is the savior."

651
00:43:17,417 --> 00:43:20,042
"Celebrate the feeling."

652
00:43:20,042 --> 00:43:22,917
"For a day and evening."

653
00:43:22,917 --> 00:43:28,208
"Beautiful hearts are beating.
Love is in the air."

654
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:30,958
"Celebrate the feeling."

655
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:33,667
"For a day and evening."

656
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:39,125
"Beautiful hearts are beating.
Love is in the air."

657
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:41,875
"Celebrate the feeling."

658
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:44,583
"For a day and evening."

659
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:49,833
"Beautiful hearts are beating.
Love is in the air."

660
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:57,042
"Somebody ask what the
eyes spoke to each other."

661
00:43:57,042 --> 00:44:00,583
"And what did they hear?"

662
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:03,500
"Say quietly."

663
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:11,583
"Both have chosen their
life partner."

664
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:14,333
"This velvety moment."

665
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:16,917
"This soft fervor."

666
00:44:16,917 --> 00:44:21,625
"These clouds of dream.
Lord is the savior."

667
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:27,667
"This beautiful beloved."

668
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:32,458
"It's the story of love."

669
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:37,875
"Lord is the savior.
Lord is the savior."

670
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:42,708
"Lord is the savior."

671
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:48,833
"Lord is the savior.
Lord is the savior."

672
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:54,583
"Lord is the savior."

673
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:09,333
Thank you. Thank you.

674
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:11,042
Teach. Please.

675
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:15,250
One, two, three, four, five,
six...

676
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,333
Three, four, five, six.

677
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:19,042
Seven, eight.

678
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:21,000
Well done!
- And jump.

679
00:45:21,417 --> 00:45:23,042
This is not a step. I can't do
this.

680
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:27,625
Govind, why aren't you
rehearsing?

681
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:29,292
You are dancing, who will watch
us?

682
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:31,167
Are you sure about this?
- Right!

683
00:45:32,042 --> 00:45:33,458
Think about it.

684
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:35,542
I already did!

685
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:38,000
I think I hear the bell.

686
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,125
Bell?

687
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:44,750
Jai has this strange
theory but it's amazing.

688
00:45:45,792 --> 00:45:47,542
What's the worst that could
happen?

689
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:50,667
Probably a slap or two!

690
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:53,750
Right! Life keeps slapping us...

691
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:56,667
We were slapped almost daily
when in college. - You mean you!

692
00:45:57,875 --> 00:46:00,708
You know this is very special,
bro!

693
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:05,417
I can tell... she is special.

694
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:09,042
Do you know she is a
professor in a college.

695
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,625
No! I think this is too sweet.

696
00:46:14,042 --> 00:46:16,375
Naina, you are very sweet.
- You're so sweet.

697
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:19,250
You are sweeter! - Shut up. -
Gayatri, here are some more
outfits.

698
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:22,667
You better decide what you
want to wear. It's too much now.

699
00:46:22,667 --> 00:46:25,250
Mom, I can't decide, I
want you to do it, please.

700
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:29,542
I can't do it.
- This is beautiful.

701
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:33,792
Arjun, don't keep your
feet on the coffee-table.

702
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:36,292
Dad is calling you, come on!

703
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:38,375
Come on.
- Arjun!

704
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:44,875
Where does Sheila teach?

705
00:46:45,417 --> 00:46:46,833
At "Jamia Milia". But why?

706
00:46:48,792 --> 00:46:51,250
What does she teach?
- Urdu.

707
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,833
Urdu.
- Sheila teaches Urdu.

708
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:55,125
Good. But in which language?

709
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:58,625
English!

710
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:01,750
Great... now you should learn
Urdu.

711
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:05,375
Just a second...
Govind and Urdu, why?

712
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:06,792
Correct!

713
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:09,583
Correct!
- To hell with correct!

714
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:13,083
It's my wedding and you
want to hog the limelight!

715
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:17,917
"We celebrate
an auspicious occasion."

716
00:47:17,917 --> 00:47:23,292
"Drums and clarions are
playing."

717
00:47:23,292 --> 00:47:32,375
"I have found my beloved."

718
00:47:32,375 --> 00:47:37,833
"Lord, protect me."

719
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:40,167
Congratulations.

720
00:47:40,167 --> 00:47:45,458
"My heart wants to dance.
My heart wants to dance."

721
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:50,417
"I just want your company. O
damsel,
I just want your company."

722
00:47:50,417 --> 00:47:53,250
"Come with me."

723
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:56,500
"And dance."

724
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:02,167
"My heart wants to dance.
My heart wants to dance."

725
00:48:02,167 --> 00:48:04,917
"When I see you."

726
00:48:04,917 --> 00:48:13,000
"I don't know why my
heart beats fast, beloved."

727
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:20,083
"I am fragrant,
unnerved, afraid, beloved."

728
00:48:20,083 --> 00:48:24,042
"What have you done?"

729
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:29,458
"This beauty and you.
This fragrance today."

730
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:34,458
"This beauty and magic.
Lord is the savior."

731
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:39,792
"This beautiful beloved."

732
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:44,875
"It's the story of love."

733
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:50,375
"Lord is the savior.
Lord is the savior."

734
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:54,167
"Lord is the savior."

735
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:58,458
"Savior."
- "Lord is the savior."

736
00:48:58,458 --> 00:49:01,208
"Lord is the savior."

737
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:05,292
"Lord is the savior."

738
00:49:16,792 --> 00:49:20,625
This stinks... it's pretty
but...see?

739
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,250
No, no I trust you.
- Me too, I think.

740
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,250
You can smell.
- No, he can smell. Smell...

741
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,125
Smell...
- Okay, just smell it.

742
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:28,417
It's horrible.

743
00:49:28,417 --> 00:49:31,625
It's gross.
- Sort of.. - One second.

744
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:34,833
Hello.
- Hi, Naina.

745
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:36,417
One second. Hi Dhruv.

746
00:49:40,583 --> 00:49:42,417
What?
- Nothing.

747
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,375
We're having so much fun.

748
00:49:45,375 --> 00:49:47,875
That's great love.
When is the "sangeet"?

749
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:52,958
Tomorrow night. And you have
no idea what we have planned.

750
00:49:53,333 --> 00:49:55,917
I wish you were here.
- Well... you know...

751
00:49:55,917 --> 00:49:59,417
I know you can't
make it because of work.

752
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,875
I understand, Dhruv.

753
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:03,958
Wow! Will you let me talk?

754
00:50:04,375 --> 00:50:08,333
I'm in Delhi for a conference
and I'll be in Chandigarh
tomorrow.

755
00:50:08,542 --> 00:50:12,292
I'll be there by noon,
understand?

756
00:50:13,667 --> 00:50:17,167
Text me the address
and I'll see you soon.

757
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:24,083
Okay, smartie pants... good
night!

758
00:50:28,917 --> 00:50:30,333
That was Dhruv.

759
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:38,042
He is coming tomorrow in time
for the performance. I'm
shocked.

760
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:40,417
But in a good way.

761
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:46,833
Yeah, of course, I mean... I
thought
he would make it to the wedding.

762
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:48,333
I'm just surprised.

763
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:53,792
That's great, right? Now he can
watch your world class
performance!

764
00:50:53,792 --> 00:50:57,542
Oh no, I'm suddenly very
nervous.

765
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,833
I won't be able to sleep
tonight.

766
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:03,958
Come on, Jai, let's practice.
- Relax!

767
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:08,167
You will be able to sleep
and perform too. Just chill.

768
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:10,375
Trust me! Right?
- Trust him!

769
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:12,833
Why not?
- Trust him, I mean.

770
00:51:14,625 --> 00:51:17,667
- Breathe... - Okay, okay!

771
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:28,500
'You will be able to sleep...
trust me!'

772
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,917
Idiot.

773
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,000
Now where's Gayatri...

774
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:47,917
It's me, Jai.

775
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:49,625
Jai, what are you...

776
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:53,167
What are you doing here?

777
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:55,625
I'm taking a walk, why?

778
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:57,875
But why are you all
covered up like a thief?

779
00:51:57,875 --> 00:52:01,667
Because it's cold. Do you mind?
What are you doing here?

780
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:03,167
I was thirsty.

781
00:52:03,167 --> 00:52:05,292
You had water? No go back to
sleep.

782
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:06,542
Go! Get lost!
- No..

783
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:08,542
I'm not thirsty anymore.
- Very good.

784
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,750
Very good, now go back to
sleep! Go!

785
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:16,458
But Jai?

786
00:52:17,292 --> 00:52:20,875
Can't you talk
without screaming? Woman!

787
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:23,792
If you don't tell me what
you are doing over here...

788
00:52:23,792 --> 00:52:27,000
I will scream like a mad
woman and bring down the house!

789
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,417
You better tell her!

790
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:31,625
Arjun... is that you?

791
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,333
Yes, it's me!
- Where is Gayatri?

792
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:38,708
Where are we going? What's this
for?

793
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:45,875
Naina, if you ask another
question,
you will be strapped to this.

794
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:49,375
You will be asleep and
we'll get some peace.

795
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,750
Get it?

796
00:52:54,417 --> 00:52:56,000
but...

797
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,375
Sorry!

798
00:53:17,917 --> 00:53:21,500
You're idiots! I
could hear you in here.

799
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:23,792
Why don't you take
morning tea to Alok too!

800
00:53:24,875 --> 00:53:28,458
Sorry, Biji. Let's go?

801
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:32,875
No, I like being held
under house arrest. Let's go.

802
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:35,208
Gayatri, have you taken the
thermos?

803
00:53:35,208 --> 00:53:37,750
Yes, Biji. Let's go?

804
00:53:37,833 --> 00:53:39,042
Of course!

805
00:53:39,042 --> 00:53:41,292
But where to go?

806
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:14,625
"I fell in love."

807
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:22,542
"I fell in love."

808
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:40,583
Use these yellow and white
flowers..

809
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:42,792
..to decorate the wall.
- Good morning, uncle.

810
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:46,167
Naina, where are you off to?
- I'm going to pick up Dhruv.

811
00:54:46,167 --> 00:54:47,708
Good morning.
- Hi.

812
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:50,250
So, all set?
- Yup!

813
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:53,292
See you. Bye!
- Bye!

814
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:57,792
Where were you? Forget her.
We need to set the flowers.

815
00:54:57,792 --> 00:55:01,333
Alok! Come on,
not the flowers for me!

816
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:05,750
Come on! The women are
finalising the jewellery and
sarees.

817
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,917
We are left with the flowers.
Come on. Quick.

818
00:55:08,167 --> 00:55:11,208
Make it quick or Alok will kill
me!

819
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:14,167
Yes. We will do it. - Yes. We
have to decorate that wall too.

820
00:55:14,167 --> 00:55:15,500
Yes, sir.

821
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:23,583
Madam, chair.

822
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:24,917
Thank you.

823
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:42,250
Hey partner...

824
00:55:42,417 --> 00:55:43,792
Hey partner...

825
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:47,167
What's wrong? The train is
delayed?

826
00:55:48,292 --> 00:55:52,917
No, a total delay.
Dhruv won't make it.

827
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:55,667
Something came up at work.

828
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,417
Ouch!

829
00:56:01,542 --> 00:56:05,625
So are you waiting for the
decorator to show up with the
tent?

830
00:56:07,042 --> 00:56:09,417
Come on... get up. Lend me a
hand!

831
00:56:09,417 --> 00:56:12,375
I'm totally confused...
orange or white?

832
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:15,958
Yellow and white!

833
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:18,375
Yellow and white, sorry.

834
00:56:21,208 --> 00:56:24,167
Come on... let's walk and talk.

835
00:56:32,917 --> 00:56:36,333
So, do you also do this?

836
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:40,208
Make plans with your
girlfriend and ditch her?

837
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:44,625
Actually, that's Radhika's
nature.

838
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:46,208
Really?

839
00:56:46,417 --> 00:56:50,833
Wow good! I'm glad,
here's to women's power!

840
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:54,792
Don't you feel hurt?

841
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:57,750
Do you feel hurt?

842
00:56:57,917 --> 00:56:59,333
Of course, I do.

843
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:03,750
For a little while,
then I cheer myself up.

844
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:07,250
I think about all the good
things.

845
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,583
No relationship is perfect.

846
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:11,792
I guess you are right.

847
00:57:11,792 --> 00:57:15,583
Nothing is perfect,
you get used to it.

848
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:18,417
I often think about the
direction..

849
00:57:18,417 --> 00:57:20,542
..our relationship
is taking and then...

850
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:23,625
brain freeze!

851
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:25,375
So, it's best not to think.

852
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:28,875
Yeah... but you know Jai...

853
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:30,542
I've always believed that..

854
00:57:30,542 --> 00:57:35,250
..our habits were once
something we could choose.

855
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:37,667
We have to choose right.

856
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:40,000
Interesting!

857
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:44,000
But let's say, just imagine...

858
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:45,833
..the choice is right..

859
00:57:46,292 --> 00:57:49,250
..but what if a slightly
better option comes along?

860
00:57:49,542 --> 00:57:50,875
Then?

861
00:57:55,917 --> 00:57:57,292
Crazy!

862
00:57:57,625 --> 00:58:00,875
Let's go and tell Govind.
The loser is still asleep.

863
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:03,875
Still asleep?
- Yes and it's one o'clock!

864
00:58:03,875 --> 00:58:05,583
Let's throw water...
- Yes, water!

865
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,417
First water. And now, beer.

866
00:58:11,083 --> 00:58:17,458
Arjun... you're not nervous
about getting married, are you?

867
00:58:17,458 --> 00:58:18,833
Not really, why?

868
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:20,958
Because...

869
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:23,083
Let me have that.

870
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:28,542
Well if you have any doubts,
you can check with Govind.

871
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:30,417
He's done this twice!

872
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:32,292
Yeah man!

873
00:58:32,917 --> 00:58:34,375
Starting today you are my best
man.

874
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:35,917
Just stay with me.
- Yes. I will.

875
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:40,167
You guys are devils! You
aren't invited for my next
wedding.

876
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,500
No problem, dude.

877
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,458
We'll attend the one after that!

878
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:48,667
Same old joke. Three
times a day! Like a routine!

879
00:58:50,458 --> 00:58:51,792
Are you mad?

880
00:58:53,167 --> 00:58:54,542
Just finish that.

881
00:58:54,667 --> 00:58:58,333
What are you guys smoking?
What is it?

882
00:58:58,333 --> 00:59:00,125
Think of it as a gift of
nature!
- Nature, huh?

883
00:59:00,125 --> 00:59:02,292
He's getting married, he needs
it!

884
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,917
You guys are quite dangerous,
you know.

885
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:08,125
You want me to tell Gayatri?
- No, no way.

886
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:11,542
You've changed... everything
is,
'you want me to tell Gayatri?'

887
00:59:13,292 --> 00:59:15,958
It's not rocket science,
just watch...

888
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:17,750
One, two, three...

889
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:23,333
Gayatri, I can't wear this!

890
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:25,000
What's wrong?

891
00:59:26,208 --> 00:59:28,667
So what's the problem? You look
hot!

892
00:59:29,125 --> 00:59:33,958
Arjun! I can't wear this!

893
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:36,125
Come on, you look good.

894
00:59:36,125 --> 00:59:37,750
You're mad! I look like Santa
Claus.

895
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:40,500
What is their problem?
All they have to do is dance.

896
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,833
What's wrong with Santa Claus?
- It's all red!

897
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:45,875
What are you talking about?
- It's looking very nice.

898
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,125
Very nice!

899
00:59:48,917 --> 00:59:50,125
You remember the steps, right?

900
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:54,042
Yes, every step. I
can't wait to dance.

901
00:59:54,042 --> 00:59:57,750
I told you we were
going to have a great time.

902
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:00,792
Just look at you... matching!

903
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:05,750
Wow, this is fun!

904
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,625
I think I need to pee!

905
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:13,750
Come on guys! It's show time!

906
01:00:17,208 --> 01:00:20,917
"Sound and disco. San
Francisco."

907
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:24,917
"Sound and disco. San
Francisco."

908
01:00:24,917 --> 01:00:29,500
"Sound and disco. San
Francisco."

909
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:44,708
"Neither liquor nor
alcohol nor barmaid."

910
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:48,458
"Neither liquor nor
alcohol nor barmaid."

911
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:52,792
"Nor a glass of drink."

912
01:00:52,792 --> 01:01:00,583
"Your arrival is what
cheers up my heart."

913
01:01:00,583 --> 01:01:04,667
"Your arrival."

914
01:01:04,667 --> 01:01:08,583
"Your arrival."

915
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:12,417
"Your arrival."

916
01:01:12,417 --> 01:01:16,000
"Your arrival."

917
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,917
"Neither flower nor
bud nor bulbul's."

918
01:01:19,917 --> 01:01:24,042
"Neither flower nor
bud nor bulbul's."

919
01:01:24,042 --> 01:01:27,875
"Chirping."

920
01:01:27,875 --> 01:01:35,667
"Your arrival is what
cheers up my heart."

921
01:01:35,667 --> 01:01:39,542
"Your arrival."

922
01:01:39,542 --> 01:01:43,417
"Your arrival."

923
01:01:43,417 --> 01:01:47,375
"Your arrival."

924
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:51,000
"Your arrival."

925
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,125
"Love makes the world go round."

926
01:02:06,708 --> 01:02:10,208
"Sound and disco. San
Francisco."

927
01:02:10,208 --> 01:02:14,458
"Sound and disco. San
Francisco."

928
01:02:14,458 --> 01:02:18,417
"Heaven in dreams."

929
01:02:18,417 --> 01:02:23,042
"When I saw it."

930
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:34,042
"Heaven in my dreams."

931
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:37,958
"When I saw it."

932
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:42,083
"Flowers also didn't cheer me
up."

933
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:47,042
"I started searching for you."

934
01:02:53,542 --> 01:02:57,417
"Neither the spring of
heaven nor fairies'."

935
01:02:57,417 --> 01:03:01,542
"Neither the spring of
heaven nor fairies'."

936
01:03:01,542 --> 01:03:05,583
"Smile."

937
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:13,250
"Your arrival is what
cheers up my heart."

938
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:17,292
"Your arrival."

939
01:03:17,292 --> 01:03:21,417
"Your arrival."

940
01:03:25,542 --> 01:03:28,542
That's it.

941
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:32,875
Where is Pinku?

942
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:34,542
I think he is on the stage.

943
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:39,417
Let's go.

944
01:03:39,417 --> 01:03:42,500
Jai. - We are coming. Let's go.
Let's go. - All the best.

945
01:03:48,167 --> 01:03:57,167
"One day I also went
to the jewelry market."

946
01:04:03,792 --> 01:04:11,583
"One day I also went
to the jewelry market."

947
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:20,625
"I remembered your eyes
amidst diamond necklaces."

948
01:04:27,208 --> 01:04:31,083
"Neither pearl nor
diamonds nor jewelries."

949
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:34,750
"Neither pearl nor
diamonds nor jewelries."

950
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:38,958
"Nor any treasure."

951
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:46,917
"Your arrival is
what cheers up my heart."

952
01:04:46,917 --> 01:04:50,875
"Your arrival."

953
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:54,625
"Your arrival."

954
01:04:54,625 --> 01:04:58,542
"Your arrival."

955
01:04:58,542 --> 01:05:02,625
"Your arrival."

956
01:05:02,625 --> 01:05:06,583
"Your arrival."

957
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:10,292
"Your arrival."

958
01:05:10,292 --> 01:05:14,250
"Your arrival."

959
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:18,125
"Your arrival."

960
01:05:18,125 --> 01:05:22,083
"When you come to me, baby."

961
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:26,083
"When you come to me, baby."

962
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:28,042
Dhruv.

963
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:55,417
Wow, you look lovely. I made it!

964
01:05:55,417 --> 01:05:57,417
My foot you made it!
- Why?

965
01:05:57,417 --> 01:05:59,000
You missed the performance.

966
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,417
No... I caught the last part.

967
01:06:00,417 --> 01:06:04,000
You were so hot...
so hot and I know you.

968
01:06:04,667 --> 01:06:07,042
Let me introduce you to the
others.
- Okay.

969
01:06:07,042 --> 01:06:08,708
Guys this is Dhruv.

970
01:06:08,958 --> 01:06:10,250
Gayatri...
- Hi.

971
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,875
Arjun, congratulations guys!

972
01:06:11,875 --> 01:06:13,708
Thank you.
- You must be so...excited?

973
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:16,125
Yes!
- It's like..

974
01:06:16,292 --> 01:06:17,625
Just a second.

975
01:06:17,958 --> 01:06:19,333
Jai...

976
01:06:20,292 --> 01:06:21,667
Hey...
- Hi...

977
01:06:21,792 --> 01:06:23,583
Too good, man. You
were amazing up there.

978
01:06:23,583 --> 01:06:25,167
All thanks to you.

979
01:06:25,167 --> 01:06:26,375
Thanks to me?

980
01:06:26,375 --> 01:06:30,792
Yes, if you were here, you
would've been Naina's partner.

981
01:06:30,792 --> 01:06:34,083
Oh that way, but let me
tell you, I can't do this.

982
01:06:34,083 --> 01:06:35,458
Thank God for you!

983
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:38,250
That's true.
- Welcome.

984
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,625
Hope you enjoy yourself.
- Thanks.

985
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:42,292
Let me take you to Biji.

986
01:06:42,292 --> 01:06:43,667
Okay.
- Take care, guys.

987
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,000
Bye.
- See you.

988
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:49,208
It's time to...

989
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:51,375
Bar. The bar is there.

990
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:52,750
The bar is..

991
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:06,958
Naina.

992
01:07:14,042 --> 01:07:15,417
Naina.

993
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:05,542
Life can be so unpredictable.

994
01:08:06,792 --> 01:08:09,292
Biji was so full of life and...

995
01:08:11,292 --> 01:08:14,167
I can't believe she is no more.

996
01:08:16,957 --> 01:08:20,332
Darling, I think..

997
01:08:21,207 --> 01:08:25,207
..anything Arjun's
family decides will be okay.

998
01:08:27,957 --> 01:08:33,207
But I think right now
you should be strong..

999
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:37,458
..at least for Arjun.

1000
01:08:44,082 --> 01:08:46,166
Gayatri, you should eat
something.

1001
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:50,332
You should eat something.

1002
01:08:52,042 --> 01:08:53,417
I think you should.

1003
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:56,792
I'll get something.

1004
01:09:03,667 --> 01:09:05,125
Hi Naina...
- Hi.

1005
01:09:05,542 --> 01:09:07,000
You okay?
- Yeah.

1006
01:09:07,292 --> 01:09:08,875
How is Gayatri?

1007
01:09:11,707 --> 01:09:13,207
I'll check on her.

1008
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:17,625
Where is Dhruv?
- He is taking a shower.

1009
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:20,250
Naina

1010
01:09:22,167 --> 01:09:27,375
..can I see you tomorrow
at six in the morning?

1011
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,125
It's important.

1012
01:09:31,707 --> 01:09:34,249
Yeah... sure!

1013
01:09:34,917 --> 01:09:36,292
Bye.

1014
01:10:03,375 --> 01:10:04,750
You are late.

1015
01:10:05,667 --> 01:10:10,875
I know, sorry. I always
have a problem waking up.

1016
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:15,375
The five minute snooze ends up
being more than ten minutes!

1017
01:10:15,375 --> 01:10:17,750
Sorry.
- I know that feeling.

1018
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:22,083
So why did you call me out here?

1019
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:25,750
Naina, I need to tell you
something.

1020
01:10:30,417 --> 01:10:31,625
What?

1021
01:10:31,625 --> 01:10:35,125
After Biji's death I
realised something...

1022
01:10:36,792 --> 01:10:38,625
life is too short.

1023
01:10:40,417 --> 01:10:48,167
Everything is here and now...
the chances, the moments.

1024
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:53,792
And a delay won't change the
facts.

1025
01:10:57,167 --> 01:11:04,292
Yes, but...
- Now I hope he understands
this.

1026
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:16,167
What's up? Why did you call me
here?

1027
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:21,667
Arjun... don't postpone the
wedding.

1028
01:11:23,292 --> 01:11:27,417
Have you lost it completely?
At this moment?

1029
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:29,083
Naina...I mean..

1030
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,750
Listen to me, Arjun.

1031
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:34,542
Do you think Biji would like
it if you postponed the wedding?

1032
01:11:35,042 --> 01:11:37,250
Of course not, never!

1033
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,250
Biji always told us
that life is very short.

1034
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:43,417
And that we should
celebrate every day...

1035
01:11:43,417 --> 01:11:49,792
..every relationship, the
love we share, our friends.

1036
01:11:50,958 --> 01:11:52,833
And this is your wedding!

1037
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:58,292
She was so excited and happy..

1038
01:11:59,542 --> 01:12:01,958
..that you and Gayatri
were getting married.

1039
01:12:02,458 --> 01:12:04,583
Here... now...

1040
01:12:07,083 --> 01:12:08,583
I know it's tough, brother
but...

1041
01:12:08,667 --> 01:12:10,000
God knows I know.

1042
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:12,458
Biji is with us.

1043
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:20,167
She is here and she will always
be!

1044
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:22,167
Make sure she is happy.

1045
01:12:24,292 --> 01:12:26,458
You know this is the
generosity and love of our
elders...

1046
01:12:27,667 --> 01:12:32,500
..even as they leave us
they expect us to be happy.

1047
01:12:38,667 --> 01:12:44,625
Do you remember in school I
always failed in English
spelling...

1048
01:12:45,625 --> 01:12:50,333
Biji would teach me...
after learning it herself.

1049
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:54,167
But she always got it wrong.

1050
01:12:56,625 --> 01:13:00,667
I got Gayatri to meet
her before anyone else.

1051
01:13:01,792 --> 01:13:03,958
Without her how can I...

1052
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:09,625
Exactly the
way she would want you to.

1053
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:12,875
Happy and smiling.

1054
01:13:16,583 --> 01:13:17,833
Go and talk to Gayatri.

1055
01:13:17,833 --> 01:13:25,125
"Why do we meet when we
have to lose each other?"

1056
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:32,500
"When heart has to wither,
why does it blossom?"

1057
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:39,833
"Why do we meet when we
have to lose each other?"

1058
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:46,083
"When heart has to wither,
why does it blossom?"

1059
01:13:46,083 --> 01:13:47,708
I'm so glad you did that.

1060
01:13:47,917 --> 01:13:52,125
Anything for Biji, Naina.
Her happiness is in this.

1061
01:13:55,333 --> 01:13:57,083
Why did you ask me to be here?

1062
01:13:57,667 --> 01:14:01,625
You know what it is to lose a
loved one and still carry on.

1063
01:14:02,917 --> 01:14:09,917
And I felt that if you are with
me,
I wouldn't be all alone...

1064
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:18,000
Well actually...
- I know.

1065
01:14:20,167 --> 01:14:21,542
But I promise

1066
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:27,042
whenever you need me...

1067
01:14:27,958 --> 01:14:30,167
..no matter what... if you need
me...

1068
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:33,542
I'll be there...

1069
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:38,500
silent but strong.

1070
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:41,125
Sure?

1071
01:14:41,667 --> 01:14:43,250
Sure!

1072
01:14:56,125 --> 01:15:03,458
"Lord is the savior."

1073
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,875
"Lord is the savior."

1074
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:18,708
"Lord is the savior."

1075
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:33,042
"Lord is the savior."

1076
01:15:33,167 --> 01:15:38,583
"Lord is the savior."

1077
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:50,333
"Lord is the savior."

1078
01:15:58,917 --> 01:16:04,292
"Lord is the savior."

1079
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:10,000
Bye guys...

1080
01:16:10,708 --> 01:16:12,083
Bye.
- See you.

1081
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:14,125
See you.
- Bye. See you.

1082
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:15,625
Bye, Naina!
- See you. - Bye.

1083
01:16:15,792 --> 01:16:18,042
Shall we go?

1084
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:22,917
Glad you made it. For a moment
I thought you're not coming.

1085
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:27,792
Dhruv...

1086
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,875
Take care, buddy.
- You too.

1087
01:16:30,875 --> 01:16:32,417
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1088
01:16:32,417 --> 01:16:34,000
I'll get our bags.
- Yeah.

1089
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:51,083
- Bye Jai. - Bye Naina.

1090
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:52,917
If you ever visit Bombay...

1091
01:16:54,417 --> 01:16:55,792
Sure.

1092
01:17:56,208 --> 01:18:01,500
Dude, what's wrong with you?
Come on... cheers!

1093
01:18:01,625 --> 01:18:03,667
Cheers? For what?

1094
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,125
Because we are free again!

1095
01:18:10,917 --> 01:18:15,708
Tell me, how was lunch?
And your mom?

1096
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:17,042
Lunch.

1097
01:18:19,583 --> 01:18:23,333
It's too close to the kitchen,
do you have anything else?

1098
01:18:23,333 --> 01:18:26,542
This is too small, do
you have anything else?

1099
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,875
I think this is fine.

1100
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,083
Thank you.

1101
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:40,792
What would you like to have,
aunty-ji? Some soup?

1102
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:43,875
I'll have anything you call
for.
Your taste is the best.

1103
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:45,333
Okay, no soup then.

1104
01:18:46,667 --> 01:18:52,000
One steam wantons without sauce
and a vegetarian noodles.

1105
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,917
I don't like onions, carrots
and
mushrooms, so only add capsicum.

1106
01:18:56,917 --> 01:18:58,500
Yes ma'am.

1107
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,417
What's up with you? Why so
silent?

1108
01:19:00,417 --> 01:19:03,083
China Garden is your
favourite restaurant.

1109
01:19:03,083 --> 01:19:09,292
Yes, mom, it is my favourite
but
Radhika is talking right now.

1110
01:19:09,417 --> 01:19:14,250
Idiot! Have you thought
about your wedding yet?

1111
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,583
Come on, mom!

1112
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:17,917
- Excuse me! - Yes?

1113
01:19:17,917 --> 01:19:20,875
Can I have one pepsi
with lots of ice. - Sure, sir.

1114
01:19:20,875 --> 01:19:22,208
Not aerated drinks again!

1115
01:19:22,208 --> 01:19:25,708
Excuse me, can you make
that an ice tea, please? Thank
you.

1116
01:19:25,708 --> 01:19:27,208
- And excuse me...
- Yes ma'am?

1117
01:19:27,292 --> 01:19:30,458
Please see to it that the food
is
very fresh and piping hot.

1118
01:19:30,458 --> 01:19:31,833
Sure ma'am.

1119
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:35,958
And really hot! If it's not
hot, I won't accept it.

1120
01:19:35,958 --> 01:19:41,083
Excuse me, can you ask the
chef to use less ajinomoto?

1121
01:19:41,083 --> 01:19:45,083
Lunch! It ruined everything.

1122
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:47,125
Any more questions, Mr. Govind?

1123
01:19:47,417 --> 01:19:51,458
No... so which restaurant was
this?

1124
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:54,208
Govind... let's go
back to Chandigarh.

1125
01:19:54,208 --> 01:19:55,792
I can't get the wedding
out of my mind.

1126
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:58,625
What are we doing here...
I mean what are we doing?

1127
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:01,708
Bro, that wedding is over.

1128
01:20:02,333 --> 01:20:04,750
But more weddings will
happen I am sure.

1129
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:08,583
But are you sure you can't get
the wedding out of your mind...

1130
01:20:08,583 --> 01:20:10,625
or is it 'someone' on your mind?

1131
01:20:13,458 --> 01:20:14,708
Do you think so?

1132
01:20:14,708 --> 01:20:16,042
I think so!

1133
01:20:19,042 --> 01:20:20,250
You know who?

1134
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:21,542
You think I am stupid?

1135
01:20:21,542 --> 01:20:25,208
I know who! You want to know?

1136
01:20:25,667 --> 01:20:27,000
No!

1137
01:20:30,958 --> 01:20:34,208
So Jai is the guy from Delhi.

1138
01:20:34,833 --> 01:20:36,125
Stop it, Ritu!

1139
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:37,583
I should stop it?

1140
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:40,583
Okay.

1141
01:20:46,292 --> 01:20:52,542
I think you have a crush...
a little crush on him.

1142
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:57,583
Dhruv still exists, you know.
He hasn't vanished.

1143
01:20:57,917 --> 01:21:04,500
Of course, that will be too
much to
ask. - Rubbish. You naughty girl.

1144
01:21:05,542 --> 01:21:08,708
Stop imagining things, Ritu.
The wedding is over.

1145
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:14,208
I am back to my old routine and
he is back to his fun routine.

1146
01:21:23,208 --> 01:21:25,417
What were you saying, Jai?

1147
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:33,417
Just a second...coaster..

1148
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:38,125
..carry on.

1149
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:40,583
Radhika, this isn't working.

1150
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:44,625
What's wrong now? You want
to quit your job again!

1151
01:21:44,625 --> 01:21:47,125
No, this is not working.

1152
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,833
You are frustrating me again.
What is 'this'?

1153
01:21:49,833 --> 01:21:51,625
This means us.

1154
01:21:54,167 --> 01:21:59,167
I am sorry. I know it's
coming like a surprise.

1155
01:21:59,417 --> 01:22:01,167
Why are we even together,
Radhika?

1156
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:03,542
Because we want to get married,
Jai.

1157
01:22:03,542 --> 01:22:07,208
You want to get married or
do you want to marry me?

1158
01:22:07,208 --> 01:22:09,875
I don't understand... what
sort of question is that?

1159
01:22:09,875 --> 01:22:14,417
It may sound complicated but
it really is very simple.

1160
01:22:17,083 --> 01:22:18,250
At Arjun's wedding..

1161
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:22,500
..I realised that though we are
together we really are far
apart.

1162
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:25,208
It's because our priorities
are different.

1163
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:27,042
Tell me..

1164
01:22:28,667 --> 01:22:29,875
..when was the last time..

1165
01:22:29,875 --> 01:22:32,375
..we really did something
together from our heart.

1166
01:22:34,792 --> 01:22:36,542
I just want to be honest..

1167
01:22:39,083 --> 01:22:40,417
.. that's it.

1168
01:22:41,833 --> 01:22:43,875
What are you getting at, Jai?

1169
01:22:44,167 --> 01:22:45,333
You mean the two years that...

1170
01:22:45,333 --> 01:22:49,083
I have invested into this
relationship are a waste?

1171
01:22:49,083 --> 01:22:51,500
Keeping track of your
21 family members'..

1172
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:55,917
..21 birthdates and wishing
them is a waste?

1173
01:22:56,208 --> 01:22:59,458
Tolerating your annoying
habits is a waste?

1174
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:03,375
Jai, to be honest, you are
ruining
my well laid out plan!

1175
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:08,292
In the next two years I wanted
to have my first child...

1176
01:23:08,542 --> 01:23:09,792
now how's that going to happen?

1177
01:23:09,792 --> 01:23:13,417
Radhika, relax... calm down.

1178
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:15,875
Probably the plan itself is
wrong.

1179
01:23:15,875 --> 01:23:20,458
I mean somewhere along the way
the plans scored over love.

1180
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:25,333
But who knows... right? Perhaps
there's someone else for us...

1181
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:30,125
Who will love us...
for the real reasons.

1182
01:23:30,875 --> 01:23:32,250
The right reason.

1183
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:37,417
Someone else? You met someone
else?

1184
01:23:40,833 --> 01:23:42,167
I did!

1185
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:54,708
But neither am I with her nor
is she madly in love with me.

1186
01:23:54,708 --> 01:23:56,083
There's no such thing like that.

1187
01:23:56,583 --> 01:23:59,250
She has nothing to do with
our situation.

1188
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:03,833
I swear!

1189
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:07,125
Have you told your mom?

1190
01:24:07,917 --> 01:24:10,458
She is sure to kill me!

1191
01:24:11,917 --> 01:24:19,375
I was hoping you could
break the news to her.

1192
01:24:32,042 --> 01:24:33,375
Coaster!

1193
01:24:35,042 --> 01:24:36,583
I guess you are right.

1194
01:24:37,833 --> 01:24:41,958
I mean, I am the strong type
but...

1195
01:24:42,083 --> 01:24:49,458
I thought something like
this would shatter me.

1196
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:51,667
But I'm not.

1197
01:24:52,875 --> 01:24:54,333
Isn't that strange?

1198
01:25:00,917 --> 01:25:07,625
We could remain friends... I
mean,
if it's alright with you.

1199
01:25:08,208 --> 01:25:12,917
I need some time, Jai.
I'll call you.

1200
01:25:14,583 --> 01:25:15,917
Okay.

1201
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:22,833
Jai..

1202
01:25:25,708 --> 01:25:32,042
.. if ever wish to pursue
the girl you've met...

1203
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:35,708
please do it after you've
changed your habits.

1204
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:38,000
It will create a good
impression.

1205
01:25:44,792 --> 01:25:47,750
- Hello. - Hi, busy?

1206
01:25:48,667 --> 01:25:51,083
Just working for the exhibition.

1207
01:25:51,083 --> 01:25:53,083
Any plans for tonight?

1208
01:25:53,083 --> 01:25:56,875
Just me and Arundhati Roy...
at the most some coffee.

1209
01:25:56,875 --> 01:26:00,250
That sounds exciting.

1210
01:26:00,458 --> 01:26:01,833
Don't rub it in!

1211
01:26:01,917 --> 01:26:05,250
I'll have you know, though I
may
not agree with her viewpoint but...

1212
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:07,333
she is way more interesting
than ..

1213
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:10,250
..your financial spreadsheets
and numbers...

1214
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:13,125
with whom you spend every night.

1215
01:26:13,292 --> 01:26:16,792
Fine, let's change our plans.

1216
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:18,208
Dinner.

1217
01:26:18,292 --> 01:26:21,875
Wow, sounds good.

1218
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:27,375
- Tonight at 9pm. Don't be
late.
- Okay bye.

1219
01:26:39,083 --> 01:26:42,458
Weren't you afraid of her?
That was quite a risk.

1220
01:26:43,125 --> 01:26:48,375
I sure was but I figured that
it
makes sense to accept the truth.

1221
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:54,500
As for risk, crossing the road
is also a risk. Isn't it?

1222
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:57,083
Well that was it!

1223
01:26:57,708 --> 01:27:03,208
So Mr. Govind, now you and
I are in the same category.

1224
01:27:03,208 --> 01:27:07,167
Single... and officially
ready to mingle.

1225
01:27:07,167 --> 01:27:09,125
No, brother.

1226
01:27:09,125 --> 01:27:11,417
I don't belong to that
category anymore.

1227
01:27:12,167 --> 01:27:13,417
You know Sheila?

1228
01:27:13,417 --> 01:27:15,083
Sheila? God damn it Govind!

1229
01:27:15,083 --> 01:27:19,375
We are back in Delhi...
back to reality.

1230
01:27:19,583 --> 01:27:21,167
You took her number?

1231
01:27:24,583 --> 01:27:27,917
You basket, when?

1232
01:27:27,917 --> 01:27:29,250
What are you doing?

1233
01:27:29,875 --> 01:27:31,833
Come on bro, it's simple
technology!

1234
01:27:31,833 --> 01:27:34,583
FB... friend request.

1235
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:38,958
I think I'll ask her
out for coffee today.

1236
01:27:38,958 --> 01:27:42,125
I think you should take
your sad story elsewhere.

1237
01:27:42,125 --> 01:27:43,417
I'm committed, man!

1238
01:27:43,417 --> 01:27:45,458
Committed my ass!

1239
01:27:45,458 --> 01:27:46,958
Being committed to the
idea of commitment..

1240
01:27:46,958 --> 01:27:48,292
.. doesn't mean you are
committed.

1241
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:50,750
Have you lost it completely?
- Get lost.

1242
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:52,917
Sheila? Facebook?

1243
01:27:52,917 --> 01:27:54,250
Loser.
- Give me a break!

1244
01:27:55,667 --> 01:27:57,375
Oh shit! Naina!

1245
01:28:01,583 --> 01:28:07,083
Hey Jai, how are you? Please
accept my friend request.

1246
01:28:07,083 --> 01:28:10,208
I want to tag you in
the wedding pictures.

1247
01:28:10,208 --> 01:28:13,208
Bye! Smileys!

1248
01:28:13,333 --> 01:28:16,750
Don't be silly! We were
all there at the wedding.

1249
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:19,083
She wants to share the
pictures,
that's it.

1250
01:28:19,333 --> 01:28:21,542
Even I was there at the
wedding...

1251
01:28:21,708 --> 01:28:23,875
but nobody's sharing
anything with me.

1252
01:28:23,875 --> 01:28:27,000
Well Sheila is sharing...
her old age.

1253
01:28:29,458 --> 01:28:32,333
That was a good one. Let's
see the pictures.

1254
01:28:33,417 --> 01:28:38,125
Hey check out pinku... and
Gayatri!

1255
01:28:43,083 --> 01:28:44,417
Look at Arjun!

1256
01:28:46,417 --> 01:28:47,750
What now?

1257
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,417
Now... back to work!

1258
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:53,750
You like Naina, right?

1259
01:28:54,708 --> 01:28:59,625
Govind! Naina is with Dhruv
and she lives in Bombay.

1260
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:00,958
Where do we live?

1261
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:04,625
Jai.

1262
01:29:04,917 --> 01:29:07,292
Jai, we need to renew these
advertisement contracts.

1263
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:10,083
Didn't you close the
endorsements
deal last time?

1264
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:11,958
- Yes sir.
- Good!

1265
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:14,667
So get ready, this time
you're going to Bombay.

1266
01:29:14,792 --> 01:29:16,792
- Here's the file. - Okay, sir.

1267
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:23,125
Let's book your ticket.

1268
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:40,333
- Hi... - Hello.

1269
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:44,208
- Come... - Thank you.

1270
01:29:49,667 --> 01:29:54,375
So, I've ordered some wine.
The one you like?

1271
01:30:01,792 --> 01:30:03,125
Well done.

1272
01:30:05,458 --> 01:30:07,917
So, a dinner plan...
out of the blue?

1273
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,208
Well, it has been a while..

1274
01:30:15,625 --> 01:30:17,250
..and there's something else.

1275
01:30:18,375 --> 01:30:19,708
What?

1276
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:24,375
I'm leaving for Singapore
tomorrow for ten days.

1277
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:32,083
- Great! - What?

1278
01:30:32,083 --> 01:30:34,792
That means you will
miss my exhibition.

1279
01:30:35,417 --> 01:30:38,750
Oh God! How could I forget!

1280
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:41,625
I am so sorry... I feel so
stupid!

1281
01:30:41,625 --> 01:30:44,417
I have a very good reason for
it.

1282
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:48,792
Go on!

1283
01:30:49,042 --> 01:30:54,917
The management thinks if I like
the set-up over there...

1284
01:30:54,917 --> 01:30:58,792
I could be the Vice President
for Emerging Markets.

1285
01:30:58,792 --> 01:31:00,417
Isn't that great?

1286
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:06,333
That's great, Dhruv. I
am so happy for you.

1287
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:10,500
You always wanted this.
- Thanks.

1288
01:31:12,167 --> 01:31:15,333
Don't worry about the
exhibition, really!

1289
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:24,667
Will you marry me?

1290
01:31:28,542 --> 01:31:31,625
Your menu.
- Sir? - Thanks!

1291
01:31:31,625 --> 01:31:34,167
- Give us a few minutes? - Sure
sir.

1292
01:31:37,333 --> 01:31:43,750
Listen... I know that
everything
is happening very quickly.

1293
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:46,667
But that's exactly how life
throws up opportunities.

1294
01:31:47,042 --> 01:31:50,792
I'll be back in ten days and
then you can decide...

1295
01:31:50,792 --> 01:31:55,292
the type of wedding, the
location,
the setting.

1296
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:57,583
Toast?

1297
01:31:58,417 --> 01:31:59,750
Come on...

1298
01:32:03,875 --> 01:32:07,708
the future is about to unfold
with unexpected surprises.

1299
01:32:07,708 --> 01:32:09,000
Trust me.

1300
01:32:16,375 --> 01:32:20,083
Good morning, sir.
Have a pleasant flight.

1301
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:34,833
Well, well... what could
have made my super..

1302
01:32:34,833 --> 01:32:37,708
..independent daughter
think of her mother?

1303
01:32:38,958 --> 01:32:40,417
Dhruv proposed to me.

1304
01:32:41,167 --> 01:32:44,417
He did? What did you reply?

1305
01:32:45,583 --> 01:32:46,917
Nothing.

1306
01:32:47,792 --> 01:32:49,125
What do you mean nothing?

1307
01:32:51,625 --> 01:32:53,958
He left no room for me to reply.

1308
01:32:54,417 --> 01:32:57,292
He was so sure I would
say yes that...

1309
01:32:57,750 --> 01:33:00,958
he didn't realise whether
I had said yes or no.

1310
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:06,500
What's the matter, dear?
Aren't you happy?

1311
01:33:07,458 --> 01:33:08,792
I don't know, mom.

1312
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:16,958
You know Dhruv and I have
been good friends.

1313
01:33:17,833 --> 01:33:22,375
I'm an emotional fool while
he is too practical.

1314
01:33:22,375 --> 01:33:27,208
I believed this would be a
good combination for us.

1315
01:33:27,208 --> 01:33:30,917
And that he would bring a sense
of balance to my life.

1316
01:33:33,542 --> 01:33:34,875
But now you know...

1317
01:33:36,417 --> 01:33:39,542
How did you know, mom...
that dad was the one?

1318
01:33:40,625 --> 01:33:42,458
Or uncle Ashu after him?

1319
01:33:43,292 --> 01:33:44,625
A sign, Naina.

1320
01:33:45,375 --> 01:33:48,958
A little sign and you will know
it.

1321
01:33:48,958 --> 01:33:50,708
You will feel him...

1322
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:57,625
you'll feel that thrill that
just fills up your heart.

1323
01:33:58,125 --> 01:34:03,083
Mom, hold on a second. Hello?

1324
01:34:03,083 --> 01:34:05,458
If you ever visit Bombay...

1325
01:34:05,458 --> 01:34:08,708
- Jai! - Hi Naina.

1326
01:34:09,042 --> 01:34:11,125
Listen, I am going to call you
back!

1327
01:34:12,292 --> 01:34:14,292
Yeah, sure.

1328
01:34:14,417 --> 01:34:15,750
Bye!

1329
01:34:18,333 --> 01:34:19,667
Mom...

1330
01:34:21,833 --> 01:34:23,167
Idiot!

1331
01:34:23,542 --> 01:34:26,125
Call as soon as you land...

1332
01:34:26,375 --> 01:34:29,333
on the advice of a
two-time divorcee!

1333
01:34:29,583 --> 01:34:32,667
Jai... you are... fantastic!

1334
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:37,542
Naina, just do what you've
always done in life.

1335
01:34:37,542 --> 01:34:40,417
Follow you heart, not your mind.

1336
01:34:40,417 --> 01:34:41,750
Trust yourself.

1337
01:34:42,583 --> 01:34:46,500
I know you will take
the right decision.

1338
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:47,750
Love you, sweetheart.

1339
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:51,083
I love you too, mom. Bye!

1340
01:34:59,375 --> 01:35:03,167
Jai... what are you doing in
Bombay?

1341
01:35:03,167 --> 01:35:05,792
Well... I thought I'd visit you.

1342
01:35:07,542 --> 01:35:09,000
Just kidding!

1343
01:35:10,292 --> 01:35:12,500
Work brought me here so I
thought

1344
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:15,333
you could show me around Bombay.

1345
01:35:15,333 --> 01:35:16,958
I'm so bored here at
this guest house.

1346
01:35:17,083 --> 01:35:19,375
Your timing couldn't
have been better!

1347
01:35:19,375 --> 01:35:24,458
Really? My dad always
said my timing sucked.

1348
01:35:24,583 --> 01:35:25,792
How is that?

1349
01:35:25,792 --> 01:35:29,375
Well... my arrival into this
world
put an end to his honeymoon period!

1350
01:35:31,708 --> 01:35:35,125
Nothing has changed neither
you nor your sad jokes!

1351
01:35:35,417 --> 01:35:37,833
Please... before they
get any sadder..

1352
01:35:37,958 --> 01:35:40,833
- Coffee? - Yeah!

1353
01:35:43,417 --> 01:35:44,750
Thank you.
- Welcome, ma'am.

1354
01:35:44,958 --> 01:35:46,708
So, now your exhibition is
set...

1355
01:35:46,708 --> 01:35:48,042
anything else that's exciting?

1356
01:35:48,542 --> 01:35:51,250
Nothing actually. You know..

1357
01:35:52,708 --> 01:35:58,208
Gayatri's wedding was so high
on energy... You were there. -
Yes.

1358
01:35:59,125 --> 01:36:01,833
that now everything seems
lifeless.

1359
01:36:01,833 --> 01:36:03,167
I really get it.

1360
01:36:03,292 --> 01:36:05,833
I still sing those songs
in the shower and...

1361
01:36:05,833 --> 01:36:09,125
my mom thinks it's
a sign. Ridiculous!

1362
01:36:09,125 --> 01:36:13,417
Maybe it is! Is Radhika ready?

1363
01:36:13,917 --> 01:36:15,292
Not anymore.

1364
01:36:17,167 --> 01:36:20,500
We... we broke up.

1365
01:36:22,292 --> 01:36:23,542
But, why?

1366
01:36:23,542 --> 01:36:26,667
I've figured out a slightly
more perfect option, Naina.

1367
01:36:28,833 --> 01:36:30,167
Being single!

1368
01:36:31,917 --> 01:36:34,417
And to be honest, Radhika
and my future had..

1369
01:36:34,417 --> 01:36:36,208
..a question mark dangling over
it.

1370
01:36:36,292 --> 01:36:40,000
But my mom hasn't given up hope.

1371
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,292
- You know how they are. - I
know.

1372
01:36:42,542 --> 01:36:44,958
I guess all mothers are
like that.

1373
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,458
How is Govind?

1374
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:55,708
Govind... he got himself into
an interesting situation.

1375
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:59,042
Really? You mean, Sheila?

1376
01:36:59,375 --> 01:37:00,750
So what? A slap?

1377
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:03,792
Not exactly...

1378
01:37:07,542 --> 01:37:09,167
Hello sir.

1379
01:37:09,833 --> 01:37:13,292
- Salesman?
- No, sir.

1380
01:37:13,292 --> 01:37:16,667
- Bank account?
- No, sir.

1381
01:37:23,542 --> 01:37:28,625
Sir, I am Govind, Sheila's
friend.
I'm not a salesman.

1382
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:32,167
- You are Sheila's friend?
- Yes, sir.

1383
01:37:33,875 --> 01:37:37,792
- Well... in that case, come
in.
- Thank you, sir.

1384
01:37:42,750 --> 01:37:44,667
- Would you like some tea?
- Yes.

1385
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,792
Vinod, a cup of tea, please.

1386
01:37:55,333 --> 01:37:56,667
What?

1387
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,333
Nothing, sir.

1388
01:37:59,792 --> 01:38:01,083
Sit down.

1389
01:38:02,542 --> 01:38:03,792
Can I clean my gun?

1390
01:38:03,792 --> 01:38:05,417
Oh... yes, please.

1391
01:38:07,958 --> 01:38:09,542
How did you and Sheila meet?

1392
01:38:09,542 --> 01:38:14,208
We met at Arjun and
Gayatri's wedding.

1393
01:38:14,208 --> 01:38:16,042
Since then we've been friends.

1394
01:38:16,125 --> 01:38:18,167
Rubbish!
- Sorry?

1395
01:38:18,167 --> 01:38:19,500
Rubbish... dirt in the barrel.

1396
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:28,958
Don't guns frighten you, sir?

1397
01:38:30,417 --> 01:38:31,917
Are you holding the gun?

1398
01:38:34,292 --> 01:38:36,667
No, sir.
- Then what's to fear?

1399
01:38:38,333 --> 01:38:43,292
No, sir. I mean there are often
articles in newspapers...

1400
01:38:43,292 --> 01:38:47,708
'Man shoots himself with gun.'

1401
01:38:48,958 --> 01:38:53,792
Fear creeps in when the
barrel is pointed at you.

1402
01:38:53,792 --> 01:38:55,417
In the army...

1403
01:38:55,417 --> 01:39:04,500
Vinod! Inform Sheila that a
certain
Govind is here to see her.

1404
01:39:11,667 --> 01:39:12,958
What are you doing here?

1405
01:39:13,167 --> 01:39:14,458
Nothing, sir.

1406
01:39:14,458 --> 01:39:17,583
Why are you creeping up
on me? - No, sir.

1407
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:21,042
Are you alright?

1408
01:39:21,042 --> 01:39:22,333
Yes.

1409
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:24,208
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

1410
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:26,083
Then what are you doing here?

1411
01:39:27,042 --> 01:39:28,333
Sir... view.

1412
01:39:28,333 --> 01:39:29,917
View?
- The garden.

1413
01:39:29,917 --> 01:39:32,583
What about the garden?
- Butterfly.

1414
01:39:32,583 --> 01:39:35,458
- Butterfly? You like
butterfly?
- Yes, sir.

1415
01:39:35,458 --> 01:39:39,542
Big one. - Yes. - Small one.
- Yes. - Red ones.

1416
01:39:39,542 --> 01:39:42,833
- All types sir.
- All types of butterflies.

1417
01:39:43,333 --> 01:39:44,792
You like butterflies?

1418
01:39:44,792 --> 01:39:48,375
I love...
- Butterflies... wow!

1419
01:39:48,375 --> 01:39:49,792
Hi...

1420
01:39:49,875 --> 01:39:53,458
Sheila, let's go, we're running
late. - Yes, come on.

1421
01:39:53,458 --> 01:39:54,792
Just a minute...

1422
01:39:55,792 --> 01:39:59,167
Is the coffee on a train or a
bus
that it will leave without you?

1423
01:39:59,167 --> 01:40:00,917
- No, sir.
- You will miss it?

1424
01:40:00,917 --> 01:40:02,375
Dad!
- Just a minute.

1425
01:40:02,375 --> 01:40:04,000
Sheila does everything
at her own time

1426
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,250
We literally counted hours
before she was born.

1427
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:07,000
She spent two years in
the second grade. - Okay, dad.

1428
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
She will get married when
she thinks its time...

1429
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,875
..it also takes a while
to understand people.

1430
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:16,083
You get it? - Yes. - Do you
gamble?
- Sometimes sir.

1431
01:40:16,083 --> 01:40:17,833
Do you drink?
- Sometimes.

1432
01:40:17,833 --> 01:40:19,083
With guys?

1433
01:40:19,083 --> 01:40:22,833
Sometimes. - With guys?
- Oh no, no, sir!

1434
01:40:22,833 --> 01:40:24,417
I was married twice before.

1435
01:40:24,417 --> 01:40:26,375
To whom?
- To women.

1436
01:40:26,375 --> 01:40:28,750
Are you sure?
- Sir, you are welcome to check.

1437
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:30,042
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

1438
01:40:30,583 --> 01:40:32,750
Yes, sir. I love everything
about nature, sir.

1439
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:35,000
I just want to have coffee
with Sheila, sir.

1440
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,667
Okay, dad, that's enough!
Stop giving him a hard time?

1441
01:40:36,667 --> 01:40:37,958
Okay. That's it.

1442
01:40:37,958 --> 01:40:39,792
I am giving him a hard time?
- Yes!

1443
01:40:39,792 --> 01:40:43,375
He has been married twice
and he loves butterflies! - No.
No.

1444
01:40:43,375 --> 01:40:45,167
I am not giving him hard time.

1445
01:40:45,167 --> 01:40:47,250
Do you understand? Yeah. Okay.

1446
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:48,583
Let's go!

1447
01:40:48,833 --> 01:40:50,375
Nine o'clock back home.

1448
01:40:50,375 --> 01:40:53,750
I'll make it, sir.
- I mean Sheila. Bye.

1449
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:57,417
Okay, that's it, dad.
Bye, see you later. Come on.

1450
01:40:57,417 --> 01:41:00,125
Hey... see you later.

1451
01:41:00,125 --> 01:41:02,125
Okay, right, sir.

1452
01:41:02,125 --> 01:41:06,458
Come on!

1453
01:41:11,292 --> 01:41:13,250
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1454
01:41:13,708 --> 01:41:17,375
Your dad is quite
an interesting man. Nice.

1455
01:41:17,458 --> 01:41:21,250
I was just looked at my watch,
he
said we should be back by nine.

1456
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:22,958
He said a lot of other things.

1457
01:41:23,333 --> 01:41:25,542
He said I do everything late.
- Right.

1458
01:41:25,542 --> 01:41:28,333
We'll be back late,
he'll understand.

1459
01:41:28,333 --> 01:41:31,500
- No, no... - Come on!.
- No. Really.

1460
01:41:32,958 --> 01:41:36,917
Oh, my God.
- Oh God! Butterflies!

1461
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:44,167
It's too much pressure.

1462
01:41:44,167 --> 01:41:45,667
So when did they get back?

1463
01:41:45,667 --> 01:41:47,333
On the dot at nine.

1464
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:50,750
This time Sheila finally gave
in.

1465
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:56,250
It's amazing love makes
people do amazing things.

1466
01:41:56,417 --> 01:41:57,750
Yup.

1467
01:42:01,583 --> 01:42:03,667
11 o'clock tomorrow?

1468
01:42:03,667 --> 01:42:08,250
11? Oh, yeah. A tour of Bombay?
- Exactly!

1469
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:12,958
Exciting. Alright, I'll see you.

1470
01:42:12,958 --> 01:42:14,750
Text me when you get home.

1471
01:42:15,333 --> 01:42:18,208
Jai, this is Bombay. Don't
worry.

1472
01:42:18,208 --> 01:42:19,542
Corrected again!

1473
01:42:21,083 --> 01:42:25,833
- Pink butterfly!
- Garden butterfly!

1474
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:49,750
"We are awake as well as
asleep.
We are a bit lost."

1475
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:55,625
"Lost in love. Love, love,
what is love?"

1476
01:42:55,625 --> 01:43:01,542
"We are awake as well as
asleep.
We are a bit lost."

1477
01:43:01,542 --> 01:43:07,250
"Lost in love. Love, love,
what is love?"

1478
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:12,750
"The air is vibrant.
Conversations are fragrant."

1479
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:17,333
"The weather is so warm."

1480
01:43:17,333 --> 01:43:23,042
"Why do we fall in love?"

1481
01:43:23,042 --> 01:43:28,792
"If you know, tell me. I don't
know."

1482
01:43:28,792 --> 01:43:34,958
"Why do we fall in love?"

1483
01:43:34,958 --> 01:43:42,208
"If you know, tell me.
I don't know."

1484
01:43:42,208 --> 01:43:49,125
"I don't know."

1485
01:43:49,125 --> 01:43:52,500
"Is this love?"

1486
01:43:54,333 --> 01:44:01,250
"Can you feel it?
Tell me. Love. Love."

1487
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:06,542
Have you wondered why your
previous
two marriages ended in a divorce?

1488
01:44:08,167 --> 01:44:09,500
Okay.

1489
01:44:10,625 --> 01:44:17,667
Suchitra and
I were classmates.

1490
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:21,875
Back then I was in a band...

1491
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:24,542
I was big John Travolta fan.
- Really?

1492
01:44:24,542 --> 01:44:26,292
you know 'Saturday Night Fever.'

1493
01:44:26,667 --> 01:44:30,000
Oh, how did if he's your love.

1494
01:44:31,083 --> 01:44:34,083
Dad said the same thing when
he...

1495
01:44:34,083 --> 01:44:36,750
learnt that Suchitra
was a Christian.

1496
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:42,125
There was a lot of drama and
we ran away from home.

1497
01:44:42,125 --> 01:44:46,458
Jai sneaked out with his
dad's car and drove us.

1498
01:44:46,458 --> 01:44:48,167
We got married in the church
as well as the temple.

1499
01:44:48,833 --> 01:44:52,292
I was 23 and madly in love.

1500
01:44:55,167 --> 01:44:56,500
Anyway...

1501
01:44:58,292 --> 01:44:59,625
Then?

1502
01:45:01,417 --> 01:45:05,417
then we turned 24

1503
01:45:05,417 --> 01:45:08,958
and started thinking like
adults.

1504
01:45:09,583 --> 01:45:12,792
We didn't work out. And she
left me.

1505
01:45:13,625 --> 01:45:20,917
After that I was quite low
and working for my dad.

1506
01:45:20,917 --> 01:45:23,250
My dad manufactured ball
bearings.

1507
01:45:23,542 --> 01:45:28,167
You know...those small round
things
that are used in bicycles.

1508
01:45:29,917 --> 01:45:31,917
I guess throughout school
and college...

1509
01:45:31,917 --> 01:45:33,208
I was ridiculed about balls.

1510
01:45:33,208 --> 01:45:35,750
I mean, my dad was the
ball bearing guy.

1511
01:45:38,167 --> 01:45:43,000
My second marriage was like
a life insurance plan. - What?

1512
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,417
Nandini, daughter of wealthy
guy.

1513
01:45:45,417 --> 01:45:48,458
Sweet girl but very boring.

1514
01:45:49,333 --> 01:45:55,083
We were so incompatible that we
hated spending time with each
other.

1515
01:45:55,083 --> 01:45:56,542
We would invite friends over..

1516
01:45:56,542 --> 01:45:58,958
..so we could avoid
spending time with each other.

1517
01:45:58,958 --> 01:46:02,125
That bad?

1518
01:46:02,458 --> 01:46:04,958
I decided that enough is enough.

1519
01:46:05,583 --> 01:46:07,708
Good for you..

1520
01:46:07,708 --> 01:46:09,042
Exactly!

1521
01:46:09,375 --> 01:46:13,958
I left home again and started
living in a rented place.

1522
01:46:13,958 --> 01:46:16,833
Now I'm earning 84,000
rupees a month.

1523
01:46:16,833 --> 01:46:19,000
Post tax.
- I see.

1524
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:25,042
I mean, I'm responsible for all
the mistakes and wrong
decisions.

1525
01:46:25,042 --> 01:46:26,458
It's amazing!

1526
01:46:27,125 --> 01:46:28,583
What have you decided now?

1527
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:33,167
Well... since this train isn't
going anywhere, let's go...
walking.

1528
01:46:33,167 --> 01:46:36,917
Okay. Coffee.
- Coffee. - Come on.

1529
01:46:37,333 --> 01:46:39,375
- So let's take it slow. - Sure

1530
01:46:40,917 --> 01:46:46,875
"Emotions are infused in
breaths."

1531
01:46:46,875 --> 01:46:52,750
"Dreams are weaving in eyes."

1532
01:46:52,750 --> 01:46:58,167
"The dusk seems new."

1533
01:46:58,167 --> 01:47:04,000
"The ambiance is in
the heart's favor."

1534
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:09,833
"The air is vibrant.
Conversations are fragrant."

1535
01:47:09,833 --> 01:47:14,292
"The weather is so warm."

1536
01:47:14,292 --> 01:47:20,042
"Why do we fall in love?"

1537
01:47:20,042 --> 01:47:25,875
"If you know, tell me. I don't
know."

1538
01:47:25,875 --> 01:47:31,750
"Why do we fall in love?"

1539
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:39,667
"If you know, tell me. I don't
know."

1540
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:45,458
"I don't know."

1541
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:49,625
"I don't know."

1542
01:48:15,167 --> 01:48:16,500
Naina, is absolutely right.

1543
01:48:16,917 --> 01:48:19,792
You are not like other girls.

1544
01:48:19,792 --> 01:48:22,792
Be a man! Stand up for yourself.

1545
01:48:23,125 --> 01:48:31,042
I mean be stern in life...
what's that word, Naina?

1546
01:48:31,042 --> 01:48:37,125
Confront. - Confront! Confront
all of them who have..

1547
01:48:37,125 --> 01:48:39,542
..broken your heart into
a million pieces.

1548
01:48:45,875 --> 01:48:49,375
Ritu, go on, be brave!

1549
01:48:50,542 --> 01:48:55,208
Sorry... don't you eat anything
apart from ice cream?

1550
01:48:56,458 --> 01:49:00,000
Come on, go for it!
- Okay.

1551
01:49:00,417 --> 01:49:01,750
Hey.

1552
01:49:05,667 --> 01:49:07,167
You?
- We!

1553
01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:10,667
Yes, I..

1554
01:49:15,667 --> 01:49:17,292
listen Bheem.

1555
01:49:17,917 --> 01:49:19,250
Bheem?

1556
01:49:20,792 --> 01:49:25,042
I just want to say, what
if I eat meat and eggs?

1557
01:49:25,042 --> 01:49:27,333
What if I have a couple
of bottles of vodka?

1558
01:49:27,333 --> 01:49:29,250
A couple of bottles?

1559
01:49:29,667 --> 01:49:33,750
Only sometimes, dude. Sometimes.

1560
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:36,417
At the end of the day
I am a good person.

1561
01:49:36,417 --> 01:49:39,000
Bheem, what's going on here?

1562
01:49:39,083 --> 01:49:42,208
And I know the Hanuman Chalisa
too!
- Very good. Very good.

1563
01:49:42,208 --> 01:49:47,250
Father, it happened three years
ago, we were in college.

1564
01:49:47,250 --> 01:49:51,708
Yes, right but it's over today.

1565
01:49:51,708 --> 01:49:56,750
Finally I am dumping you,
never to get back again.

1566
01:49:56,750 --> 01:49:58,083
Bheem, shut the door!

1567
01:49:58,208 --> 01:50:00,208
We'll help you.

1568
01:50:03,417 --> 01:50:05,333
Very good, Ritu!

1569
01:50:05,333 --> 01:50:08,750
Thank God. I am actually good.

1570
01:50:11,917 --> 01:50:13,542
Now to the next one.

1571
01:50:16,375 --> 01:50:19,208
What are you doing here?

1572
01:50:19,208 --> 01:50:22,667
Honey bunny, is it the ice
cream?

1573
01:50:23,958 --> 01:50:25,292
Who are they?

1574
01:50:27,708 --> 01:50:31,083
Sorry... just carry on.

1575
01:50:31,583 --> 01:50:33,333
Yes, carry on.

1576
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:41,042
He is not really...

1577
01:50:41,792 --> 01:50:47,500
I know! And I thought there
was something lacking in me.

1578
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:50,625
It's alright. - Well...
technically you were lacking...

1579
01:50:54,792 --> 01:51:00,125
Okay, no over confidence.
One more to go.

1580
01:51:00,125 --> 01:51:02,792
Let's get the hell out
of here right now.

1581
01:51:08,667 --> 01:51:10,167
I guess God heard my prayer.

1582
01:51:10,167 --> 01:51:12,000
He's not at home, let's go.

1583
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,375
Ritu!
- Yeah, I am getting it.

1584
01:51:14,958 --> 01:51:17,583
Ritu? Where have you been?

1585
01:51:17,708 --> 01:51:19,083
I called you so many times.

1586
01:51:19,083 --> 01:51:21,958
You neither take my calls nor
reply to the text messages.

1587
01:51:21,958 --> 01:51:23,292
That's true.

1588
01:51:26,167 --> 01:51:29,875
Sorry. Ritu, why didn't you
tell us?

1589
01:51:30,208 --> 01:51:33,000
You are doubting him
unnecessarily.

1590
01:51:33,333 --> 01:51:36,083
Look at his innocent face.

1591
01:51:36,583 --> 01:51:39,000
He could never cheat you.
- Cheat?

1592
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,333
That's true, Ritu.

1593
01:51:41,042 --> 01:51:43,208
His eyes reveal his honesty.

1594
01:51:43,375 --> 01:51:44,917
He won't betray you.

1595
01:51:44,917 --> 01:51:48,167
Betray? What are you talking
about?

1596
01:51:49,375 --> 01:51:54,000
I had seen your text.
- Text?

1597
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:59,208
Priya's. I'll see you soon.
Hugs and kisses!

1598
01:51:59,208 --> 01:52:00,833
Kunal.

1599
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:08,083
See that... I was right!
You are Priyanka, right? - Yes.

1600
01:52:08,458 --> 01:52:10,667
Cheat and betray!

1601
01:52:10,667 --> 01:52:13,000
You don't get it, Priyanka is
my..

1602
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,333
Priyanka is my?

1603
01:52:14,333 --> 01:52:16,583
I don't want to hear another
word!

1604
01:52:16,583 --> 01:52:20,750
Guys like you always take
girls like us for a ride!

1605
01:52:20,750 --> 01:52:22,917
Was it wrong that I love you?

1606
01:52:22,917 --> 01:52:26,458
Are you done? I love you too!

1607
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:28,792
Can I say something?

1608
01:52:30,667 --> 01:52:32,208
Priyanka is my cousin.

1609
01:52:34,250 --> 01:52:37,292
That's right. He's told
me so much about you.

1610
01:52:37,292 --> 01:52:41,042
It's not good to doubt like
that.
Kunal, I'll leave now.

1611
01:52:43,375 --> 01:52:46,792
We'll also leave...

1612
01:52:46,792 --> 01:52:51,167
No, Naina, you and I
will leave. Sorry.

1613
01:52:51,167 --> 01:52:52,500
Sorry.

1614
01:52:53,792 --> 01:52:55,125
Sorry.

1615
01:53:01,125 --> 01:53:03,083
I am so happy for them, Jai.

1616
01:53:03,083 --> 01:53:05,500
So let's celebrate!

1617
01:53:07,667 --> 01:53:09,000
Just a second.

1618
01:53:09,958 --> 01:53:11,292
Timing.

1619
01:53:13,375 --> 01:53:15,917
Hello... yes, Riddhi.

1620
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:18,583
What?

1621
01:53:20,625 --> 01:53:23,458
But... how...

1622
01:53:23,792 --> 01:53:25,375
I can't believe this.

1623
01:53:33,875 --> 01:53:35,208
What happened?

1624
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,333
No.

1625
01:53:38,333 --> 01:53:44,083
I lost the venue for my
exhibition.

1626
01:53:44,083 --> 01:53:46,375
Some confusion about
the dates and now...

1627
01:53:46,667 --> 01:53:48,417
I can't even reschedule
my exhibition.

1628
01:53:49,458 --> 01:53:50,875
So change the venue!

1629
01:53:51,875 --> 01:53:55,542
Jai, this is Bombay and these
venues aren't easy to come by.

1630
01:53:55,542 --> 01:53:57,500
Mumbai.

1631
01:54:00,333 --> 01:54:04,542
Listen, I've got an idea.
Wait for my call.

1632
01:54:04,542 --> 01:54:07,750
I'll be right back, okay?

1633
01:54:09,708 --> 01:54:13,333
Jai, one second... hello?
Mr. Fix-it?

1634
01:54:14,208 --> 01:54:15,542
Yes?

1635
01:54:16,958 --> 01:54:18,875
What do you mean,
wait for your call?

1636
01:54:19,167 --> 01:54:23,292
Relax, I'm here, aren't I?

1637
01:54:33,292 --> 01:54:34,625
Jai..

1638
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,333
..what's this?

1639
01:54:38,583 --> 01:54:44,375
Trust me, Naina.
All we need is a little more.

1640
01:54:52,125 --> 01:54:58,958
"My heart is singing a song."

1641
01:54:58,958 --> 01:55:04,875
"When you are with me,
my heart is tempting me."

1642
01:55:04,875 --> 01:55:10,625
"Look, you should be
in your senses."

1643
01:55:10,625 --> 01:55:16,250
"Tell your heart to keep quiet."

1644
01:55:16,250 --> 01:55:22,000
"The air is vibrant.
Conversations are fragrant."

1645
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:26,500
"The weather is so warm."

1646
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:32,208
"Why do we fall in love?"

1647
01:55:32,208 --> 01:55:37,958
"If you know, tell me.
I don't know."

1648
01:55:37,958 --> 01:55:43,958
"Why do we fall in love?"

1649
01:55:43,958 --> 01:55:50,458
"If you know, tell me.
I don't know."

1650
01:55:50,458 --> 01:55:55,458
You are right! All we
need is a little more.

1651
01:55:55,583 --> 01:56:02,292
"I don't know."

1652
01:56:02,292 --> 01:56:07,417
"What is love?"

1653
01:56:09,792 --> 01:56:11,667
Thank you, Mr. Fix-it.

1654
01:56:11,667 --> 01:56:12,917
You are welcome.

1655
01:56:12,917 --> 01:56:16,667
By the way who calls
pani-puri golgappas?

1656
01:56:16,667 --> 01:56:21,458
Sorry, it was a mistake.
It's a Delhi thing.

1657
01:56:21,458 --> 01:56:25,333
Right. - Shall we eat? I'm
starving..
it's three in the morning.

1658
01:56:25,667 --> 01:56:29,292
Even I'm hungry. - Sorry.
- I've put in the hard work too.

1659
01:56:29,292 --> 01:56:31,833
Right... I forgot!

1660
01:56:32,375 --> 01:56:36,208
We'd like two servings of
gol...
sorry, pani-puris.

1661
01:56:36,208 --> 01:56:37,542
Pani-puri!

1662
01:56:38,792 --> 01:56:41,917
Let's have pani-puri?
Three servings of pani-puri!

1663
01:56:41,917 --> 01:56:43,833
Hey... there's a queue.

1664
01:56:43,833 --> 01:56:45,167
Relax dude!

1665
01:56:46,458 --> 01:56:50,208
Jai, don't mess with them,
we'll go somewhere else.

1666
01:56:50,417 --> 01:56:55,708
She is right. Next time let
her mess around with us.

1667
01:56:56,458 --> 01:56:57,792
Forget it.

1668
01:57:01,583 --> 01:57:02,917
What did you say?

1669
01:57:03,292 --> 01:57:05,208
Just go away, okay!

1670
01:57:06,292 --> 01:57:10,500
Jai... stop it!

1671
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:12,500
Jai!!

1672
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:13,833
I'll give you a piece of my
mind.

1673
01:57:14,333 --> 01:57:16,250
Jai, stop it. Stop it.

1674
01:57:16,250 --> 01:57:19,792
I give you a chance.
- Jai. Jai.

1675
01:57:21,375 --> 01:57:25,000
Is this good? Is
this also a Delhi thing?

1676
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,042
Naina, they were talking shit.

1677
01:57:27,042 --> 01:57:31,458
Right, it was shit. Jai,
you could've ignored them.

1678
01:57:32,417 --> 01:57:36,042
Sometimes I just don't
understand what gets into you
guys.

1679
01:57:36,042 --> 01:57:38,792
A small thing and
you lose all control.

1680
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:43,417
A small thing? It's
not a small thing, Naina.

1681
01:57:43,417 --> 01:57:45,500
And people who treat
this as a small thing...

1682
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:47,833
should be slapped right and
left!

1683
01:57:47,833 --> 01:57:51,542
Because they are responsible
for encouraging such behaviour.

1684
01:57:51,542 --> 01:57:53,292
You think you'll
change everyone, Jai?

1685
01:57:53,292 --> 01:57:55,083
Yes, Naina, I will.

1686
01:57:55,083 --> 01:57:57,542
Merely complaining
about things doesn't help.

1687
01:57:59,167 --> 01:58:02,208
Then you should slap me too.

1688
01:58:02,208 --> 01:58:03,542
Oh God!

1689
01:58:07,792 --> 01:58:09,208
What happened?

1690
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:16,792
Jai, look... how cute...
probably alone.

1691
01:58:20,917 --> 01:58:22,292
What now?

1692
01:58:23,333 --> 01:58:26,958
Let's wait, probably
someone will come.

1693
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:36,458
I don't think anyone is coming.

1694
01:58:42,042 --> 01:58:47,333
Are you thinking the same
thing that I'm thinking?

1695
01:58:52,083 --> 01:58:55,958
I'm afraid I'm thinking..

1696
01:58:55,958 --> 01:58:57,708
..the same thing
that you're thinking.

1697
01:58:58,792 --> 01:59:00,208
What do you say?

1698
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:01,917
Let's go.

1699
01:59:07,833 --> 01:59:12,958
Oh my God! What do we call him?

1700
01:59:12,958 --> 01:59:14,417
Starving Starvo!

1701
01:59:17,958 --> 01:59:19,292
How about Lucky?

1702
01:59:19,917 --> 01:59:23,000
That's a nice name. Lucky.

1703
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Lucky.

1704
01:59:27,417 --> 01:59:30,667
Okay, Naina, I should get going.

1705
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:35,583
Hold on, I'll be right back.

1706
01:59:54,375 --> 01:59:59,208
He fell asleep... sit!

1707
01:59:59,208 --> 02:00:00,667
Naina, it's okay.

1708
02:00:00,667 --> 02:00:02,750
Not a word. Come on.

1709
02:00:08,042 --> 02:00:09,667
Better?

1710
02:00:10,833 --> 02:00:14,708
I'm sure it would be if
it were on the right side.

1711
02:00:15,625 --> 02:00:17,333
Then why did you make that
sound?

1712
02:00:17,625 --> 02:00:19,833
- Because it's cold. - Really?

1713
02:00:21,833 --> 02:00:23,208
Drama queen!

1714
02:00:28,208 --> 02:00:34,208
I feel better. I should leave.

1715
02:00:35,042 --> 02:00:38,333
I guess I'll call you.

1716
02:00:38,625 --> 02:00:40,208
I guess you will.

1717
02:00:43,958 --> 02:00:47,583
Jai, lunch?

1718
02:00:48,083 --> 02:00:52,625
I would love to but I have
an important lunch meeting.

1719
02:00:52,625 --> 02:00:56,250
Really? I forgot you
even have to work.

1720
02:00:57,083 --> 02:00:58,583
Something like that.

1721
02:00:58,750 --> 02:01:00,125
Is it interesting?

1722
02:01:00,833 --> 02:01:02,833
Well, it is nice to
see you again, Jai.

1723
02:01:02,833 --> 02:01:04,250
And it's really nice
to extend this contract.

1724
02:01:04,250 --> 02:01:05,917
Thank you, sir.

1725
02:01:06,125 --> 02:01:07,583
How are things?

1726
02:01:07,583 --> 02:01:09,625
Sir, D Decor is doing fantastic.

1727
02:01:09,625 --> 02:01:11,583
We are launch more
products next year,

1728
02:01:11,583 --> 02:01:12,875
so we're really excited.

1729
02:01:12,875 --> 02:01:15,958
Should be excited,
it's all about quality.

1730
02:01:16,042 --> 02:01:20,958
D Decor's quality and designs
are the best. So, thank you.

1731
02:01:20,958 --> 02:01:22,375
Thank you.

1732
02:01:24,625 --> 02:01:26,125
How did you get hurt?

1733
02:01:27,792 --> 02:01:32,375
Some guys said something
about a girl last night.

1734
02:01:32,375 --> 02:01:37,333
You fought for a girl?
Is she your friend?

1735
02:01:38,792 --> 02:01:40,125
Yes.

1736
02:01:40,458 --> 02:01:42,083
A special friend?

1737
02:01:47,917 --> 02:01:49,250
I think so.

1738
02:01:49,375 --> 02:01:51,542
Does she know that you
think she is special?

1739
02:01:52,458 --> 02:01:53,875
No, sir.

1740
02:01:54,083 --> 02:01:58,250
Why? You haven't told her?

1741
02:02:07,042 --> 02:02:08,750
It's complicated, sir.

1742
02:02:08,750 --> 02:02:12,042
It's always complicated.

1743
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,667
Jai, relationships are
only as complicated...

1744
02:02:15,667 --> 02:02:17,833
as you want them to be.

1745
02:02:18,625 --> 02:02:22,500
Remember this, in real
life and in films...

1746
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:24,500
there's always a happy ending.

1747
02:02:26,833 --> 02:02:30,708
So, tell her what's in your
heart.

1748
02:02:34,125 --> 02:02:35,458
Where is she?

1749
02:02:39,625 --> 02:02:45,208
Actually, she is right behind
you.

1750
02:02:58,375 --> 02:02:59,917
She's like a little monkey.

1751
02:03:04,333 --> 02:03:05,750
Hello...

1752
02:03:12,333 --> 02:03:16,500
You better tell her or
you'll repent it all your life.

1753
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:20,625
Take care buddy... see you.

1754
02:03:21,125 --> 02:03:23,250
Ma'am... pleasure.

1755
02:03:28,958 --> 02:03:30,583
Thank you... so much!

1756
02:03:30,583 --> 02:03:31,792
It's okay.

1757
02:03:31,792 --> 02:03:34,083
Thank you God for fulfilling my
wish.

1758
02:03:34,083 --> 02:03:36,167
Ritu will die of envy!

1759
02:03:36,167 --> 02:03:41,500
Naina! I didn't know
you were this filmy.

1760
02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:44,500
I mean it's cute but --

1761
02:03:44,583 --> 02:03:46,583
Listen, of course I am filmy.

1762
02:03:46,583 --> 02:03:51,083
By the way, 99 percent girls
who
meet SRK react in a similar way.

1763
02:03:51,083 --> 02:03:53,542
Right.
- He's just so charming.

1764
02:03:53,542 --> 02:03:55,000
Don't wash the hand, by the way.

1765
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:56,250
Of course, I'm not
going to wash the hand.

1766
02:03:56,250 --> 02:03:58,417
Listen, haven't you watched
DDLJ?

1767
02:03:58,417 --> 02:04:00,458
I have but it has been a while.

1768
02:04:00,458 --> 02:04:01,792
So what?

1769
02:04:01,792 --> 02:04:04,875
Nobody makes a love
story like Shahrukh Khan.

1770
02:04:04,875 --> 02:04:06,125
We're going to watch it right
now.

1771
02:04:06,125 --> 02:04:09,875
No, Naina... - I can't
watch DDLJ, I promise! Oh God!

1772
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,333
What unexpected rain!

1773
02:04:17,333 --> 02:04:19,458
Seriously! I think my watch
stopped.

1774
02:04:26,875 --> 02:04:29,375
What is this? You made a mess
again?

1775
02:04:29,375 --> 02:04:31,458
What is this?
- Not really.

1776
02:04:32,333 --> 02:04:36,375
Really? Look at this!

1777
02:04:36,375 --> 02:04:37,750
Here take this towel.

1778
02:04:39,792 --> 02:04:41,125
Here.

1779
02:04:42,458 --> 02:04:45,083
Dry yourself before
you pour out your anger!

1780
02:04:50,375 --> 02:04:55,542
Look at this... it says Bura
[Bad] Kebabs, not Bara [Big].

1781
02:04:56,125 --> 02:04:57,583
You want jumping chicken?

1782
02:04:59,292 --> 02:05:00,667
No!

1783
02:05:01,083 --> 02:05:04,625
Take your pick...
there's Chinese, Indian...

1784
02:05:04,875 --> 02:05:06,250
Nothing exciting.

1785
02:05:06,792 --> 02:05:08,000
Now what?

1786
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,958
Do you know how to make
the perfect Maggi noodles?

1787
02:05:12,375 --> 02:05:17,375
Heat water, add the noodles,
let it boil for two minutes.

1788
02:05:17,375 --> 02:05:19,292
That's obvious my friend.

1789
02:05:19,417 --> 02:05:23,792
You also add cheese..

1790
02:05:23,792 --> 02:05:29,208
..chilli and my special
ingredient.

1791
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:30,958
Is that so?

1792
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:40,500
Tell me Sheila... you are
beautiful,
intelligent, funny...

1793
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:46,458
and you know how to make
the perfect Maggi noodles.

1794
02:05:48,208 --> 02:05:51,417
I don't get it... you
can get any guy you like.

1795
02:05:51,542 --> 02:05:57,542
So how is it that you
still aren't... married...

1796
02:05:57,542 --> 02:06:01,208
The marriage question!
I was waiting for it.

1797
02:06:01,917 --> 02:06:03,667
This I don't get...

1798
02:06:04,292 --> 02:06:06,042
I mean, as soon as a girl is
born..

1799
02:06:06,042 --> 02:06:08,250
..you start thinking
of getting her married

1800
02:06:08,250 --> 02:06:10,792
It doesn't matter whether it's
through an matchmaking website
or...

1801
02:06:10,792 --> 02:06:12,167
the nephew of a neighbour or
through a distant relative.

1802
02:06:12,167 --> 02:06:13,542
Get her married off so..

1803
02:06:13,542 --> 02:06:14,917
..the parents feel
they've fulfilled their task.

1804
02:06:15,542 --> 02:06:17,958
What's with everybody
wanting me to get married?

1805
02:06:18,875 --> 02:06:20,917
There's a lot more to life than
that.

1806
02:06:21,083 --> 02:06:24,583
You were married twice,
what did you get?

1807
02:06:25,042 --> 02:06:26,417
True!

1808
02:06:28,333 --> 02:06:30,125
Thank God I didn't
give in to the pressure.

1809
02:06:30,625 --> 02:06:32,000
My logic was simple.

1810
02:06:32,208 --> 02:06:39,208
When I'd meet someone who's
outlook was off center like
mine..

1811
02:06:39,208 --> 02:06:44,833
..I would, you know and
you know what, I was right.

1812
02:06:45,708 --> 02:06:47,375
Well, I'm very happy to meet
you.

1813
02:06:47,792 --> 02:06:50,625
Wait. The secret ingredient!

1814
02:06:50,875 --> 02:06:52,750
Fried noodles?
- That's right!

1815
02:06:52,750 --> 02:06:54,667
In 'Maggi'?
- Yes. Try it.

1816
02:07:02,583 --> 02:07:03,917
Oh my God!

1817
02:07:04,125 --> 02:07:06,083
This is so good, I
think I want to marry it!

1818
02:07:13,417 --> 02:07:16,042
Hi Jai...
- Hello Naina.

1819
02:07:16,125 --> 02:07:17,458
Oh shit!
- What?

1820
02:07:17,458 --> 02:07:19,750
Sorry, I'll call you back.

1821
02:07:19,750 --> 02:07:21,125
Okay.

1822
02:07:29,458 --> 02:07:32,333
Hi Jai...
- It's Gayatri, darling.

1823
02:07:32,333 --> 02:07:34,208
Who is this Jai you were
expecting?

1824
02:07:34,208 --> 02:07:37,208
Gayatri? When did you get back?

1825
02:07:37,458 --> 02:07:39,333
Don't tell me you're set to
make me an aunt in nine months!

1826
02:07:39,333 --> 02:07:42,167
Shut up! I'll become an
aunt after you get married.

1827
02:07:42,167 --> 02:07:45,042
So is it Arjun's friend Jai?

1828
02:07:46,375 --> 02:07:48,292
Oh my God, Arjun was right!

1829
02:07:49,250 --> 02:07:50,708
About what exactly?

1830
02:07:50,708 --> 02:07:54,333
Just that there was some
connection between you and Jai.

1831
02:07:54,958 --> 02:07:56,792
It's not like that, Gayatri.

1832
02:07:56,875 --> 02:07:58,833
But you can make it like that,
Naina.

1833
02:07:59,167 --> 02:08:00,917
Dhruv proposed to me, Gayatri.

1834
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,375
You know Jai and me...

1835
02:08:06,042 --> 02:08:07,542
..maybe in another lifetime.

1836
02:08:09,083 --> 02:08:12,833
Anyway, you know... just a
second.

1837
02:08:13,458 --> 02:08:17,167
It's your life, honey. Think
about it.

1838
02:08:17,292 --> 02:08:19,292
You want me to talk to Arjun?

1839
02:08:19,292 --> 02:08:21,250
Gayatri, it's Dhruv.

1840
02:08:21,250 --> 02:08:23,167
- Hi. - Hi.

1841
02:08:23,667 --> 02:08:26,833
- I'll call you back. - Okay,
bye.

1842
02:08:28,417 --> 02:08:29,792
What are you doing here?

1843
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,125
- May I come in? - Of course,
come in.

1844
02:08:33,125 --> 02:08:36,000
Seven days are more than enough
to fall in love with Singapore.

1845
02:08:36,583 --> 02:08:38,583
Got done with my work and came
back.

1846
02:08:38,583 --> 02:08:40,125
When I landed I remembered
that...

1847
02:08:40,125 --> 02:08:41,458
I had forgotten my key back at
home.

1848
02:08:41,625 --> 02:08:44,583
So I had to come. I
would have called you. But..

1849
02:08:45,083 --> 02:08:48,000
What the hell? Why is this dog
here?

1850
02:08:48,583 --> 02:08:51,667
It's not a dog, Dhruv, it's a
puppy.

1851
02:08:51,667 --> 02:08:53,250
His name is Lucky.

1852
02:08:53,250 --> 02:08:56,042
A puppy is also a dog.
Where did you get it?

1853
02:08:56,042 --> 02:08:58,917
On the street, she was alone.

1854
02:08:58,917 --> 02:09:00,667
And you brought it home.

1855
02:09:00,667 --> 02:09:02,750
Naina, I am sure he
has 200 infections.

1856
02:09:02,750 --> 02:09:04,500
She!!
- Alright, she!

1857
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:05,792
You are over reacting, Dhruv.

1858
02:09:05,792 --> 02:09:08,000
I'm not over reacting,
you know my allergies.

1859
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
I have to take a shower.

1860
02:09:13,542 --> 02:09:18,375
Fine, you take a shower
and I will go to the studio.

1861
02:09:18,375 --> 02:09:20,417
I'm taking Lucky along.

1862
02:09:20,417 --> 02:09:22,417
I'll see you in the
evening and we'll talk.

1863
02:09:22,417 --> 02:09:23,750
Yes.

1864
02:09:31,083 --> 02:09:33,333
- Hi Naina... - Hi Jai.

1865
02:09:33,542 --> 02:09:35,917
Can I leave Lucky with
you for a few hours?

1866
02:09:35,917 --> 02:09:37,792
- Sure. - Thank you.

1867
02:09:37,792 --> 02:09:39,042
Everything alright?

1868
02:09:39,042 --> 02:09:41,667
Yes, I'll call in the evening.

1869
02:09:41,667 --> 02:09:43,417
Okay?
- Okay. - Thanks. Bye. - Bye.

1870
02:09:44,833 --> 02:09:46,792
Lucky, today I want you
to prove lucky for me.

1871
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:48,875
Come on. Let's go.

1872
02:10:33,833 --> 02:10:37,542
Lucky, be my lucky mascot today.

1873
02:10:37,542 --> 02:10:39,875
So you will ring the bell.

1874
02:10:47,125 --> 02:10:48,458
Jai?

1875
02:10:48,875 --> 02:10:50,208
Dhruv?

1876
02:10:51,542 --> 02:10:54,542
Lucky... with you?

1877
02:10:54,708 --> 02:10:56,500
Well, Naina...

1878
02:10:56,500 --> 02:10:59,708
Naina gets everyone
involved in her social service.

1879
02:10:59,708 --> 02:11:01,125
Anyway, come on in.

1880
02:11:04,292 --> 02:11:05,958
So, can I get you something to
drink?

1881
02:11:06,375 --> 02:11:08,750
Coffee, beer, Bacardi?

1882
02:11:09,750 --> 02:11:11,542
No, thanks, Dhruv. Thanks a lot.

1883
02:11:13,708 --> 02:11:16,250
Hey babe, guess who is here!

1884
02:11:16,833 --> 02:11:18,458
Jai is here with Lucky.

1885
02:11:19,792 --> 02:11:21,667
Hi Jai.
- Hi Naina.

1886
02:11:22,708 --> 02:11:25,417
Actually, sorry, I should've
called.

1887
02:11:25,417 --> 02:11:26,625
That's not a problem.

1888
02:11:26,625 --> 02:11:29,792
Give me a second, I'll be back.

1889
02:11:32,667 --> 02:11:37,167
She's a little frisky, but
don't worry, I've fed her.

1890
02:11:37,167 --> 02:11:39,125
Thank you.
- She should be fine.

1891
02:11:42,292 --> 02:11:44,333
I guess, I should leave.

1892
02:11:44,333 --> 02:11:45,542
You just got here.

1893
02:11:45,542 --> 02:11:50,458
Yes, but I came to Bombay on
business and now it's over.

1894
02:11:50,458 --> 02:11:52,458
I should prepare to return.

1895
02:11:52,458 --> 02:11:55,333
You know what, spend
the evening with us.

1896
02:11:55,333 --> 02:11:57,625
Naina, I forgot to
tell you earlier that

1897
02:11:57,625 --> 02:11:58,958
I've invited some of my friends
over.

1898
02:12:00,833 --> 02:12:03,583
Now what? - Now we have to
organise dinner and drinks.

1899
02:12:03,583 --> 02:12:05,500
Why don't you invite
some of your friends?

1900
02:12:05,667 --> 02:12:07,542
Jai, you must stay, it will be
fun.

1901
02:12:08,792 --> 02:12:11,667
Thanks, Dhruv, but I should
leave.

1902
02:12:11,667 --> 02:12:16,083
No problem.
- Naina, he's your friend, tell
him.

1903
02:12:18,125 --> 02:12:19,458
Please stay, Jai.

1904
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:25,458
Come on, guys. Let's play.

1905
02:12:25,583 --> 02:12:27,750
Each team has two players.

1906
02:12:27,750 --> 02:12:29,375
One player has explain the word

1907
02:12:29,375 --> 02:12:31,542
written on the top of the card.

1908
02:12:31,542 --> 02:12:33,167
So that's simple.

1909
02:12:33,167 --> 02:12:35,667
No, not simple.

1910
02:12:35,667 --> 02:12:37,667
The five closest
words used to explain...

1911
02:12:37,667 --> 02:12:39,708
that word are at the
bottom of the card.

1912
02:12:39,708 --> 02:12:42,333
And you have to get your
partner guess that very word...

1913
02:12:42,333 --> 02:12:44,042
without using those five words.

1914
02:12:45,333 --> 02:12:46,583
Ready?

1915
02:12:46,583 --> 02:12:48,208
Wait. I'll explain.

1916
02:12:48,583 --> 02:12:51,625
Say the word on top is Ritu.

1917
02:12:51,625 --> 02:12:54,292
The five words below is will
be...

1918
02:12:54,500 --> 02:13:00,000
- irritating, child, ice cream..

1919
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:04,500
..silly and gorgeous.

1920
02:13:05,208 --> 02:13:06,458
So smart, Dhruv.

1921
02:13:06,458 --> 02:13:07,833
Let's get started. Now come on!

1922
02:13:07,833 --> 02:13:11,000
Naina, I think you
should partner with Jai.

1923
02:13:11,417 --> 02:13:12,958
But Dhruv --

1924
02:13:12,958 --> 02:13:14,417
But he doesn't know anyone.

1925
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:17,167
He only knows Lucky and he
can't play.

1926
02:13:17,542 --> 02:13:20,875
And Ritu and I will referee,
okay?

1927
02:13:21,208 --> 02:13:23,125
Okay.

1928
02:13:23,292 --> 02:13:25,833
Okay, come on quick. Hi... I'm
Jai.

1929
02:13:29,083 --> 02:13:31,542
Okay guys, your time to starts
now.

1930
02:13:31,542 --> 02:13:33,750
Okay, Riya...
when we were in school...

1931
02:13:33,750 --> 02:13:36,458
your teacher ask you to
do this but you couldn't.

1932
02:13:36,458 --> 02:13:37,708
Maths?

1933
02:13:37,708 --> 02:13:39,250
Something else, come on...

1934
02:13:39,250 --> 02:13:40,500
Science!

1935
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:42,542
Add them altogether, more...

1936
02:13:42,542 --> 02:13:43,750
Studies.

1937
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:44,958
Okay, on to the next card.

1938
02:13:44,958 --> 02:13:46,500
You have this for your
breakfast.

1939
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:47,708
Cereal.

1940
02:13:47,708 --> 02:13:49,250
No, something else!

1941
02:13:50,583 --> 02:13:53,542
Eggs. - No, not eggs,
something else, come on.

1942
02:13:54,292 --> 02:13:55,708
Okay, Scotch.

1943
02:13:55,708 --> 02:14:00,583
Whiskey!
- Move out of alcohol. Scotch.

1944
02:14:02,333 --> 02:14:04,417
I don't know.
- Time is running out guys!

1945
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:06,917
Come on, Riya!
- Next!

1946
02:14:08,667 --> 02:14:10,000
Taxi?

1947
02:14:10,375 --> 02:14:11,750
Luggage?

1948
02:14:12,375 --> 02:14:17,125
Bags... where we first met.

1949
02:14:17,125 --> 02:14:19,208
Bus stop... bus!

1950
02:14:19,208 --> 02:14:23,583
Right! Okay this is very simple.

1951
02:14:23,958 --> 02:14:28,792
I said yellow and you said
orange.

1952
02:14:29,625 --> 02:14:33,667
Decorations... wedding...
flowers!

1953
02:14:33,667 --> 02:14:40,833
Right! Okay, go down.

1954
02:14:40,833 --> 02:14:44,250
Boxes?
- Jai, emergency!

1955
02:14:44,250 --> 02:14:46,042
Hospital.
- I'm here, aren't I?

1956
02:14:46,708 --> 02:14:50,542
Art gallery!
- Right! Okay.

1957
02:14:55,167 --> 02:14:56,500
Was...

1958
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,375
Father.

1959
02:14:59,750 --> 02:15:04,208
Times up! That's a strange
clue but amazingly played.

1960
02:15:04,208 --> 02:15:05,792
Wow.

1961
02:15:06,792 --> 02:15:10,000
Well played guys, the
others still can't believe it.

1962
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:11,250
Naina, dessert?

1963
02:15:11,250 --> 02:15:15,292
Yes, I'll come.
- Jai, join me for a smoke?

1964
02:15:15,292 --> 02:15:16,917
Yes. Come on.

1965
02:15:17,375 --> 02:15:22,250
You know, investment
banking is very stressful and...

1966
02:15:22,250 --> 02:15:26,083
to take the right decision at
the
right time can be very difficult.

1967
02:15:26,292 --> 02:15:27,708
Just like life.

1968
02:15:28,833 --> 02:15:30,875
And that's how I got this
habit of social smoking.

1969
02:15:31,917 --> 02:15:38,708
I get it, Dhruv. Sometimes
even I do it, bad habit, bro.

1970
02:15:43,375 --> 02:15:44,708
Yeah, what do you do?

1971
02:15:45,208 --> 02:15:48,833
I'm in marketing.
- Family?

1972
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,125
Just mom.

1973
02:15:53,292 --> 02:15:55,792
You aren't married, yet? I
mean..

1974
02:15:56,875 --> 02:15:58,417
Well, even you aren't married.

1975
02:15:58,792 --> 02:16:05,625
Yeah, I guess didn't get
the time. What's your excuse?

1976
02:16:05,625 --> 02:16:08,667
I guess, I didn't get the right
girl.

1977
02:16:08,917 --> 02:16:12,958
Dhruv... they're
leaving after dessert.

1978
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:15,375
Is this right?

1979
02:16:16,417 --> 02:16:19,708
What?
- Dessert plan!

1980
02:16:19,833 --> 02:16:23,083
Yeah.
- We'll leave too and we'll
drop you.

1981
02:16:23,417 --> 02:16:24,625
Good idea.
- Yeah.

1982
02:16:24,625 --> 02:16:25,958
Let's go.

1983
02:16:38,833 --> 02:16:41,541
Alright, Jai. It was a
pleasure meeting you again.

1984
02:16:41,541 --> 02:16:43,124
Stay in touch.

1985
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:45,708
Bye Dhruv, all the best.

1986
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:50,250
"There is loneliness."

1987
02:16:50,250 --> 02:16:53,416
"I don't know why."

1988
02:16:53,416 --> 02:16:56,791
"Why this punishment?"

1989
02:16:56,791 --> 02:17:01,707
"Who knows?"

1990
02:17:02,333 --> 02:17:06,125
"Paths are lonely."

1991
02:17:06,125 --> 02:17:09,875
"Arms are lonely."

1992
02:17:09,875 --> 02:17:11,958
"Eyes are lonely."

1993
02:17:11,958 --> 02:17:19,250
"Why do we meet when we
have to lose each other?"

1994
02:17:19,250 --> 02:17:26,666
"When heart has to wither,
why does it blossom?"

1995
02:17:26,666 --> 02:17:34,041
"Why do we meet when we
have to lose each other?"

1996
02:17:34,041 --> 02:17:37,666
"When heart has to wither.."

1997
02:17:37,791 --> 02:17:40,666
So that was a fun party.

1998
02:17:40,666 --> 02:17:42,999
Thank God, you had the spare
keys.

1999
02:17:43,750 --> 02:17:48,791
Thank God! Alright, Dhruv, see
you.

2000
02:17:48,791 --> 02:17:55,166
Naina, hold on.
What have you decided?

2001
02:17:55,250 --> 02:17:56,500
About what?

2002
02:17:56,500 --> 02:18:00,208
Destination or local? Big or
small?

2003
02:18:00,208 --> 02:18:02,292
The type of wedding, my love?

2004
02:18:05,041 --> 02:18:09,291
You always wanted to have a
beach wedding, didn't you?

2005
02:18:09,375 --> 02:18:14,166
Yes. I knew it, you know me so
well.

2006
02:18:14,166 --> 02:18:15,832
Before I forget...

2007
02:18:15,916 --> 02:18:20,707
Naina, surprise! We're going
to Singapore for the weekend.

2008
02:18:21,416 --> 02:18:24,499
Dhruv, but...

2009
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:27,083
Don't worry, it isn't the final
move.

2010
02:18:27,416 --> 02:18:29,999
You just have to come
and finalise the house.

2011
02:18:30,916 --> 02:18:34,332
Don't you think this
is happening to fast?

2012
02:18:34,333 --> 02:18:37,292
Why so scared? We'll be fine.

2013
02:18:41,541 --> 02:18:42,916
I'll see you.

2014
02:18:43,208 --> 02:18:44,458
Bye.
- Bye.

2015
02:18:44,458 --> 02:18:51,583
"Why do we meet when we
have to lose each other?"

2016
02:18:51,583 --> 02:18:58,875
"When heart has to wither,
why does it blossom?"

2017
02:19:01,083 --> 02:19:03,542
Loser! About time you called!

2018
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,208
Yeah... how are you?

2019
02:19:06,208 --> 02:19:08,041
I'm doing great. Absolutely fit!

2020
02:19:08,041 --> 02:19:09,957
I guess Sheila is the reason.

2021
02:19:09,958 --> 02:19:15,041
Coffee, Sheila and I...
it's amazing, dude!

2022
02:19:15,041 --> 02:19:19,624
Caffecino, frappecino, latte,
black coffee.

2023
02:19:19,625 --> 02:19:22,250
Tell me, are you in love
with coffee or Sheila?

2024
02:19:23,291 --> 02:19:24,791
I mean, both!

2025
02:19:25,250 --> 02:19:27,625
I am so happy for the
both of you, brother.

2026
02:19:27,625 --> 02:19:29,875
So how've you been?

2027
02:19:29,875 --> 02:19:34,375
I'm alright. Packing
things to come back.

2028
02:19:34,375 --> 02:19:37,291
Coming back? How is Naina?

2029
02:19:37,291 --> 02:19:40,082
Naina... is fine. She is with
Dhruv.

2030
02:19:40,625 --> 02:19:44,416
Anyway, I'm taking the night
flight tomorrow. So, see you
soon.

2031
02:19:44,416 --> 02:19:46,082
Jai, did you tell Naina
how you felt about her?

2032
02:19:46,083 --> 02:19:51,083
Govind, I've got to take this
other call. I'll call you back.

2033
02:19:51,083 --> 02:19:52,417
See you in Delhi soon.

2034
02:19:56,250 --> 02:20:02,167
"Look. Look."

2035
02:20:02,167 --> 02:20:09,458
"Things have changed
completely."

2036
02:20:09,458 --> 02:20:14,917
"You were graceful."

2037
02:20:14,917 --> 02:20:18,500
"I was not."

2038
02:20:18,500 --> 02:20:24,208
"Heart was blossoming."

2039
02:20:24,208 --> 02:20:29,292
"Those eyes filled with love,
and sweet talks."

2040
02:20:29,292 --> 02:20:32,542
"I don't know where it is lost."

2041
02:20:32,917 --> 02:20:36,667
"Why did my dear one go away?"

2042
02:20:36,667 --> 02:20:39,083
"Why did we separate?"

2043
02:20:39,083 --> 02:20:46,250
"Why do we meet when we
have to lose each other?"

2044
02:20:46,250 --> 02:20:53,750
"When heart has to wither,
why does it blossom?"

2045
02:20:53,750 --> 02:21:01,125
"Why do we meet when we
have to lose each other?"

2046
02:21:01,125 --> 02:21:09,917
"When heart has to wither,
why does it blossom?"

2047
02:21:09,917 --> 02:21:13,708
"Paths are lonely."

2048
02:21:13,708 --> 02:21:17,333
"Arms are lonely."

2049
02:21:17,333 --> 02:21:19,625
"Eyes are lonely."

2050
02:21:19,625 --> 02:21:26,833
"I don't know why
there is loneliness."

2051
02:21:26,833 --> 02:21:31,042
"Why this punishment?"

2052
02:21:31,042 --> 02:21:34,792
"Who knows?"

2053
02:21:35,292 --> 02:21:37,583
This one is better, it has A/C.

2054
02:21:37,583 --> 02:21:39,833
Arjun! Govind!

2055
02:21:39,833 --> 02:21:41,792
So champ, game, set, match?

2056
02:21:41,792 --> 02:21:43,167
What are you doing here?

2057
02:21:43,167 --> 02:21:46,375
You're in a bloody problem
and you can't even tell us?

2058
02:21:46,375 --> 02:21:47,750
What problem are you talking
about?

2059
02:21:48,125 --> 02:21:49,667
Everything is fine.

2060
02:21:49,667 --> 02:21:51,042
Bloody liar!

2061
02:21:51,042 --> 02:21:52,833
Naina and Gayatri are like
sisters.

2062
02:21:52,833 --> 02:21:55,000
And Gayatri shares everything
with me.

2063
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:56,625
You really thought we wouldn't
know..

2064
02:21:56,625 --> 02:21:58,333
..what's going on
between you and Naina?

2065
02:21:58,333 --> 02:22:00,208
There might be
something between us but...

2066
02:22:00,500 --> 02:22:02,375
..there's something
between Dhruv and Naina too!

2067
02:22:03,042 --> 02:22:04,292
Let's not complicate things.

2068
02:22:04,292 --> 02:22:08,667
In the same way that you
and Radhika had something.

2069
02:22:08,667 --> 02:22:10,583
You had realised this
a long time ago that...

2070
02:22:10,583 --> 02:22:12,917
you and Radhika aren't
meant for each other.

2071
02:22:12,917 --> 02:22:16,125
That is why you
weren't confused about Naina.

2072
02:22:16,125 --> 02:22:20,417
But Naina realised this only
after she spent time with you.

2073
02:22:20,417 --> 02:22:21,625
She needs time.

2074
02:22:21,625 --> 02:22:23,167
But what else can I do?

2075
02:22:23,167 --> 02:22:24,667
What do you mean, what else can
I do?

2076
02:22:24,667 --> 02:22:26,208
Tell Naina the truth!

2077
02:22:26,208 --> 02:22:27,917
If you don't tell Naina the
truth..

2078
02:22:27,917 --> 02:22:30,292
..your life will be
one big compromise.

2079
02:22:30,292 --> 02:22:32,875
And every girl you date
will always be second best.

2080
02:22:32,875 --> 02:22:34,083
He's right, Jai.

2081
02:22:34,083 --> 02:22:35,833
You remember what Biji would
say...

2082
02:22:35,833 --> 02:22:38,542
Have the courage to
say what's in your heart.

2083
02:22:38,542 --> 02:22:41,292
And be willing to understand
what's in another person's
heart.

2084
02:22:41,292 --> 02:22:42,708
So, do this for Biji.

2085
02:22:42,708 --> 02:22:44,083
Just go for it, buddy!

2086
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:50,000
You think she'll say yes?

2087
02:22:51,208 --> 02:22:55,667
Jai, Naina and Dhruv are
going to Singapore today.

2088
02:22:55,667 --> 02:23:00,292
So you really don't have time
to
wonder and ask stupid questions.

2089
02:23:00,292 --> 02:23:01,792
We should get going.

2090
02:23:01,792 --> 02:23:03,208
Let's go.
- We have to go!

2091
02:23:03,208 --> 02:23:04,583
Let's go.
- Come on!

2092
02:23:05,583 --> 02:23:08,167
Okay, I think we should. - We
better make a run for it, let's
go!

2093
02:23:11,667 --> 02:23:14,125
Ritu, I hope you could be...

2094
02:23:14,292 --> 02:23:15,875
I am hopeless.

2095
02:23:18,042 --> 02:23:19,583
I've checked that
the flight is on time.

2096
02:23:20,167 --> 02:23:22,500
Shall we go? I'll call the lift.

2097
02:23:28,750 --> 02:23:31,125
Naina, you're sure
you want to do this?

2098
02:23:32,792 --> 02:23:37,292
Yeah... I can't do this to
Dhruv.

2099
02:23:52,667 --> 02:23:59,958
"Why do we meet when we
have to lose each other?"

2100
02:23:59,958 --> 02:24:07,417
"When heart has to wither,
why does it blossom?"

2101
02:24:07,417 --> 02:24:14,792
"Why do we meet when we
have to lose each other?"

2102
02:24:14,792 --> 02:24:23,625
"When heart has to wither,
why does it blossom?"

2103
02:24:23,625 --> 02:24:27,375
"The paths are lonely."

2104
02:24:27,375 --> 02:24:29,500
Jai.
- Come on, they've left...hurry
up!

2105
02:24:29,500 --> 02:24:30,792
Slow down, dude.

2106
02:24:30,792 --> 02:24:33,250
It's Jai who has to talk to
Naina,
why are we running? - Listen.

2107
02:24:33,250 --> 02:24:37,375
"There is loneliness."

2108
02:24:37,375 --> 02:24:40,542
"I don't know why."

2109
02:24:40,542 --> 02:24:44,750
"Why this punishment?"

2110
02:24:44,750 --> 02:24:47,167
"Who knows?"

2111
02:24:50,250 --> 02:24:51,625
Dhruv!

2112
02:24:52,292 --> 02:24:53,625
Jai?

2113
02:24:54,917 --> 02:24:57,500
Do you mind if I speak with
Naina?

2114
02:25:02,083 --> 02:25:03,458
Sure.

2115
02:25:17,292 --> 02:25:21,458
If ever in the future
and no offence to Dhruv..

2116
02:25:23,333 --> 02:25:27,833
..you have the perfect option..

2117
02:25:29,375 --> 02:25:31,625
..and you also realise it...

2118
02:25:33,208 --> 02:25:38,792
..can we go for it without any
fear?

2119
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Do you think we can hope..

2120
02:25:42,875 --> 02:25:49,375
..that no matter how confusing
and irritating relationships

2121
02:25:50,542 --> 02:25:54,583
our story could turn
out a little different.

2122
02:25:55,208 --> 02:25:58,833
Jai...- This is the
right time to take a stand...

2123
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:04,042
This is the right chance.

2124
02:26:06,333 --> 02:26:08,750
All I need is your answer.

2125
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:11,375
That's it.

2126
02:26:13,375 --> 02:26:15,292
Jai is crazy.

2127
02:26:15,542 --> 02:26:18,750
He thinks even guys should
be decked up with henna.

2128
02:26:18,750 --> 02:26:21,250
It's because of him that
we ran out of henna and...

2129
02:26:21,583 --> 02:26:22,792
it's also because of him..

2130
02:26:22,792 --> 02:26:25,333
..that Gayatri's henna
ceremony was so much fun.

2131
02:26:26,292 --> 02:26:29,792
I danced a lot today after ages.

2132
02:26:34,042 --> 02:26:35,375
There's still more...

2133
02:26:36,833 --> 02:26:39,667
I'm back after the wedding..
- I'm back after the wedding..

2134
02:26:39,667 --> 02:26:42,250
..and everything seems so
different.

2135
02:26:42,625 --> 02:26:48,458
Life seems incomplete, as
if I left something behind.

2136
02:26:48,458 --> 02:26:50,083
I even turned my bags upside
down.

2137
02:26:51,417 --> 02:26:58,042
I guess the change isn't about
things and places, it's about
me.

2138
02:26:58,250 --> 02:27:02,708
Gayatri was right, and
perhaps so was Ritu.

2139
02:27:04,042 --> 02:27:05,625
The change is Jai.

2140
02:27:08,375 --> 02:27:11,458
How I wish I had met Jai years
ago!

2141
02:27:11,458 --> 02:27:14,792
I'd have all the
courage and the liberty..

2142
02:27:14,792 --> 02:27:17,833
..to express my feelings to him.

2143
02:27:18,458 --> 02:27:19,833
But Dhruv...

2144
02:27:24,458 --> 02:27:26,917
..he is a part of my life..

2145
02:27:28,375 --> 02:27:30,500
..and I'll have to face him.

2146
02:27:30,917 --> 02:27:32,292
What will I tell him?

2147
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:41,333
You silly girl!

2148
02:27:42,125 --> 02:27:46,083
The truth, first to
yourself and then to me.

2149
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,417
Naina, you and I were always
friends.

2150
02:28:14,750 --> 02:28:16,875
It was much later that we
decided to be with each other.

2151
02:28:17,250 --> 02:28:20,208
But it doesn't mean
the decision was right.

2152
02:28:27,125 --> 02:28:29,000
I wanted to tell you, Dhruv...

2153
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,375
but... it all happened...

2154
02:28:31,375 --> 02:28:32,917
A little too quickly, right?

2155
02:28:34,625 --> 02:28:37,375
I get it... I get it.

2156
02:28:39,625 --> 02:28:44,000
Jai, I saw this diary the
day I met you at Naina's place.

2157
02:28:58,292 --> 02:28:59,792
When I spoke with Ritu..

2158
02:29:00,583 --> 02:29:03,417
..she told me what I
probably didn't want to hear.

2159
02:29:04,375 --> 02:29:08,167
And then that evening
you spent with us, Jai.

2160
02:29:09,958 --> 02:29:14,667
Sorry, Naina, but I
had to see it myself.

2161
02:29:16,583 --> 02:29:18,500
I've got used to looking out
for you.

2162
02:29:21,125 --> 02:29:24,292
Jai, do you remember I'd said...

2163
02:29:25,542 --> 02:29:29,000
to take the right decision at
the
right time can be very difficult.

2164
02:29:30,625 --> 02:29:32,000
Just like life.

2165
02:29:34,833 --> 02:29:37,708
Well, this decision
isn't an easy one.

2166
02:29:38,750 --> 02:29:43,292
But it's very
important for all three of us.

2167
02:29:49,292 --> 02:29:52,458
On that note, I have
a flight to catch.

2168
02:29:53,625 --> 02:29:59,625
Naina, I didn't book a ticket
for you, so don't worry about
it.

2169
02:30:04,625 --> 02:30:06,667
I love you so much, Dhruv.

2170
02:30:06,792 --> 02:30:08,458
I love you as much, Naina.

2171
02:30:11,875 --> 02:30:14,167
Now, you guys take care of
each other.

2172
02:30:14,500 --> 02:30:15,833
Yeah.

2173
02:30:17,792 --> 02:30:19,167
You are a great guy, man.

2174
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:21,417
Take care of each other.

2175
02:30:24,250 --> 02:30:25,625
See you.

2176
02:30:37,833 --> 02:30:39,292
Naina... I...

2177
02:30:41,750 --> 02:30:43,458
Couldn't you have said this
earlier?

2178
02:30:45,292 --> 02:30:48,125
Naina, I...
- Naina, I... what?

2179
02:30:49,083 --> 02:30:54,083
Tell me it's a Delhi thing!
You didn't hear your bell?

2180
02:30:54,667 --> 02:31:00,917
Naina, I love you very,
very, very much!

2181
02:31:01,458 --> 02:31:02,958
I swear!

2182
02:31:03,375 --> 02:31:06,042
I have never heard a louder
bell!

2183
02:31:07,333 --> 02:31:08,708
I swear!

2184
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:25,250
Hey baby... yes, it's done. Bye.

2185
02:31:47,083 --> 02:31:51,583
"Your wishes will be
fulfilled."
- I love you too!

2186
02:31:51,583 --> 02:31:53,000
I love you more.

2187
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:57,417
You are right, brother.
- "Know that dreams come true."

2188
02:31:57,417 --> 02:32:01,875
"I am thinking this is
where I want to be."

2189
02:32:01,875 --> 02:32:03,792
No.

2190
02:32:03,792 --> 02:32:07,458
"Beloved, I am yours."

2191
02:32:09,292 --> 02:32:11,417
It's my diary.

2192
02:32:11,792 --> 02:32:14,583
"Understand what the gestures
say."

2193
02:32:14,583 --> 02:32:16,292
"Listen."

2194
02:32:16,292 --> 02:32:20,250
"Everybody is calling
to us from the heart."

2195
02:32:20,250 --> 02:32:22,958
"I am thinking this is
where I want to be."

2196
02:32:22,958 --> 02:32:25,375
Life is complicated, people.

2197
02:32:26,250 --> 02:32:27,917
Try to keep it simple.

2198
02:32:28,208 --> 02:32:30,333
Settle down with a
like-minded partner...

2199
02:32:30,708 --> 02:32:33,542
and be happy... simple!

2200
02:32:33,542 --> 02:32:37,500
Jai make it quick... first
time I'm meeting your mom.

2201
02:32:37,500 --> 02:32:40,083
Oooops not so simple

2202
02:32:40,083 --> 02:32:41,458
Coming.

2203
02:32:43,167 --> 02:32:48,750
"Beloved, your and my
conversations make me go crazy."

2204
02:32:48,750 --> 02:32:52,583
"With you I think I'll be
alright."

2205
02:32:52,583 --> 02:32:56,875
"Oh, yeah. Sometimes one
wrong can make a right."

2206
02:32:56,875 --> 02:33:02,833
"Beloved, at times the
season becomes an excuse."

2207
02:33:02,833 --> 02:33:06,042
"Never going to let
you out of my sight."

2208
02:33:06,042 --> 02:33:11,042
"Oh, baby. You make my morning,
days and night."

2209
02:33:17,875 --> 02:33:20,625
"Your kohl eyes look beautiful."

2210
02:33:20,625 --> 02:33:22,875
"An innocent boy got enticed."

2211
02:33:22,875 --> 02:33:25,250
"When you turned and looked
behind."

2212
02:33:25,250 --> 02:33:27,917
"I fell in love with you."

2213
02:33:27,917 --> 02:33:32,375
"Look, the paths are
calling out to us."

2214
02:33:32,375 --> 02:33:37,958
"We are walking without
thinking."

2215
02:33:37,958 --> 02:33:42,500
"I am thinking this is
where I want to be."

2216
02:33:42,500 --> 02:33:47,125
"Beloved, I am yours."

2217
02:33:47,125 --> 02:33:50,583
"Beloved, your and my
conversations."

2218
02:33:50,583 --> 02:33:52,833
"Make me go crazy."

2219
02:33:52,833 --> 02:33:56,542
"With you I think I'll be
alright."

2220
02:33:56,542 --> 02:34:00,833
"Oh, yeah. Sometimes one
wrong can make a right."

2221
02:34:00,833 --> 02:34:06,875
"Beloved, at times the
season becomes an excuse."

2222
02:34:06,875 --> 02:34:10,042
"Never going to let
you out of my sight."

2223
02:34:10,042 --> 02:34:13,750
"Oh, baby. You make my morning,
days and night."

2224
02:34:13,750 --> 02:34:17,833
"Beloved, your and my
conversations make me go crazy."

2225
02:34:17,833 --> 02:34:21,833
"With you I think I'll be
alright."

2226
02:34:21,833 --> 02:34:26,000
"Oh, yeah. Sometimes one
wrong can make a right."

2227
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:32,000
"Beloved, at times the
season becomes an excuse."

2228
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:35,167
"Never going to let
you out of my sight."

2229
02:34:35,167 --> 02:34:40,250
"Oh, baby. You make my morning,
days and night."

2230
02:34:47,083 --> 02:34:49,792
"Your kohl eyes look beautiful."

2231
02:34:49,792 --> 02:34:52,000
"An innocent boy got enticed."

2232
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,375
"When you turned and looked
behind."

2233
02:34:54,375 --> 02:34:56,625
"I fell in love with you."

2234
02:34:56,625 --> 02:34:58,917
"Your kohl eyes look beautiful."

2235
02:34:58,917 --> 02:35:01,125
"An innocent boy got enticed."

2236
02:35:01,125 --> 02:35:03,542
"When you turned and looked
behind."

2237
02:35:03,542 --> 02:35:05,917
"I fell in love with you."

2238
02:35:05,917 --> 02:35:11,083
"I fell in love with you."

2239
02:35:22,792 --> 02:35:26,417
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- Cut. - Oh, no..

2240
02:35:26,417 --> 02:35:28,708
My God. Sorry.

2241
02:35:31,708 --> 02:35:33,708
Cut. - You say that one
more time, I'll hit you.
