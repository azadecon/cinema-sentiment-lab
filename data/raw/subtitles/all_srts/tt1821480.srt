00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:44,999
Park street.

2
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:46,749
Tollygunge. - Dum Dum.

3
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:04,124
Passengers are advised..

4
00:04:04,207 --> 00:04:07,999
...to inform the Metro
Police on finding..

5
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:10,999
...any unidentified
box or alien object.

6
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:30,249
The door is closing.

7
00:04:35,582 --> 00:04:36,707
Hello.

8
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:38,082
Yes, I am on the train.

9
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:39,791
Which bag?

10
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:41,749
Speak louder.

11
00:04:41,874 --> 00:04:43,207
Which bag?

12
00:04:43,707 --> 00:04:46,541
Next station Ravindra Station.

13
00:04:46,832 --> 00:04:49,249
Platform on the right hand side.

14
00:05:05,832 --> 00:05:07,207
Why is she crying so much?

15
00:05:07,332 --> 00:05:08,499
She's hungry.

16
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:10,082
Why don't you feed her?

17
00:05:10,207 --> 00:05:12,582
I forgot her milk bottle at home.

18
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:15,749
Yesterday I bought a new game,
Call Of Duty: Black Cops.

19
00:05:15,874 --> 00:05:17,791
What a game. Great graphics.

20
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,666
Look, there's Kushal.

21
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,082
Kushal, why are you so scared.

22
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:29,666
Give it. Give the bag.
Why are you scared?

23
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:32,249
What are you hiding in your bag?
Is it something special?

24
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:36,999
What are you hiding in your bag?

25
00:05:37,082 --> 00:05:38,124
Give the bag. Give the bag.

26
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:40,332
What are you hiding in your bag?

27
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:45,999
I will go back home.

28
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,291
Come on. Come on, let's go.

29
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,791
Show me the bag.

30
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:59,166
Hey, you left your bag behind.

31
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,499
The milk bottle is right here.

32
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:36,332
More than 100 are
expected to be dead..

33
00:06:36,457 --> 00:06:38,874
...in Kolkata Metro Rail due
to the deadly gas attack.

34
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,957
Its believed that a terrorist
group is behind this attack.

35
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:50,916
Even on the third day passengers
are hesitating to travel by the Metro.

36
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:55,624
The relatives of those..

37
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,832
...who died in the gas attack
staged a rally in Kolkata today.

38
00:06:57,957 --> 00:06:59,749
And requested the government..

39
00:06:59,874 --> 00:07:01,832
...to find out who is
responsible for this attack.

40
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,082
Madam.

41
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,541
Madam.

42
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,041
Madam. Madam. Come with me.

43
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,166
Who are you?

44
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,207
What do you want?

45
00:08:24,332 --> 00:08:26,124
Move, move.

46
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:28,457
Move, move.

47
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,041
You shouldn't lift heavy
objects in such a condition..

48
00:08:31,124 --> 00:08:32,541
Move. Go away.

49
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,166
You shouldn't lift heavy
objects in such a condition.

50
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,666
Let me, let me.

51
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,999
Leave it. - I know, I have a kid too.

52
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:43,457
Let me, madam. Please.

53
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,291
Move aside. Move.

54
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:46,499
You are taking my passenger.

55
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:47,916
Madam, please come with me.

56
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,332
Please move.

57
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:16,082
Don't mind, madam. But
can I ask you something?

58
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:18,832
I have been driving a
taxi for the past 15 years.

59
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,207
Every passenger either goes home
or to the hotel from the airport.

60
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,749
You are the first passenger who is
going straight to a police station.

61
00:09:28,082 --> 00:09:29,832
Get the tea quickly.

62
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,874
Press any key.

63
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:38,666
It's up, it's up, it's up..

64
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,457
Here it is.

65
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,707
It's here.

66
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:46,707
It's working!

67
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:47,999
It's shut down again.

68
00:09:48,124 --> 00:09:49,207
What happened now?

69
00:09:49,832 --> 00:09:52,291
That's what his wife
must be saying every night.

70
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,916
Sign here.

71
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,624
Madam, here's the police station.

72
00:10:37,832 --> 00:10:39,041
How much?

73
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:49,499
Here's your bag.

74
00:10:52,124 --> 00:10:53,791
Madam, this is my number.

75
00:10:56,499 --> 00:10:58,082
If you ever need a taxi, call me.

76
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,332
Thank you.

77
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,999
Where do I go to file a
missing person's report?

78
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,457
Yes, you go...

79
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,874
Just go straight.. I mean,
it's just straight ahead.

80
00:11:15,957 --> 00:11:17,082
Thank you.

81
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,999
Shall I carry this?

82
00:11:19,707 --> 00:11:21,207
Thanks. - It's okay.

83
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:25,374
My husband is missing.

84
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:34,332
Are you coming from out of town?

85
00:11:35,124 --> 00:11:36,082
London.

86
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,166
You arrived just now?

87
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,541
Yes.

88
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,041
Madam.

89
00:11:42,957 --> 00:11:45,832
We will need some details.

90
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:49,124
Actually, a month ago.. - Tea.

91
00:11:50,874 --> 00:11:51,999
Will you have tea?

92
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:52,999
No.

93
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,332
Yes, go ahead.
- He came to Kolkata a month ago.

94
00:11:57,457 --> 00:11:59,832
He had a two week assignment
in the National Data Centre.

95
00:11:59,957 --> 00:12:01,999
Okay. - First two weeks
we would talk every day.

96
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:03,957
Then he suddenly stopped calling.

97
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,624
No messages or anything.

98
00:12:05,707 --> 00:12:07,916
And I didn't know what to do.

99
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,749
So I came here directly. I..

100
00:12:09,874 --> 00:12:11,666
Speak softly.

101
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:13,791
Doesn't my time have any value?

102
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,916
Why are you screaming? No need
to shout. He can hear you clearly.

103
00:12:18,832 --> 00:12:19,707
Your name.

104
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:20,999
Vidya Bagchi.

105
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,041
Bidya Bagchi.

106
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,416
No, it's Vidya. With a V.

107
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:30,082
Madam, in Kolkata Vidya,
Bidya .. same feelings

108
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:31,999
Isn't it, Rana? - What?

109
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:33,916
Vidya, Bidya are all
the same, isn't it?

110
00:12:36,582 --> 00:12:38,082
Your husband's name?

111
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:39,874
Arnab. - Bagchi?

112
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:43,707
Arnab..

113
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,207
Stop messing with it Rana

114
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:48,999
Sorry.

115
00:12:49,082 --> 00:12:49,999
And age?

116
00:12:50,124 --> 00:12:51,124
33.

117
00:12:52,624 --> 00:12:53,291
Complexion.

118
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,541
Wheatish.

119
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:55,916
Height?

120
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:58,624
A little taller than this.

121
00:12:58,832 --> 00:13:00,499
5117

122
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,999
Do you have a photograph? - Yes.

123
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:06,707
Doesn't my case have any value?

124
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:07,999
Doesn't my case have any value?
-Softly. Softly.

125
00:13:08,124 --> 00:13:10,749
What softly? - You will speak softly
or else I will throw you out.

126
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,791
He is listening to
what you are saying.

127
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,041
Love marriage.

128
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,249
Is this a year old?

129
00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:26,041
No, two years.

130
00:13:26,124 --> 00:13:27,291
Don't you have a latest one?

131
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:33,791
No.. Arnab didn't like
to get his pictures taken.

132
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:36,374
'Isn't it enough that we
ran away and got married?'

133
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:38,166
'Now we have to get a picture
taken as well." - Come here.

134
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,999
Otherwise what's
the proof that you married me?'

135
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:42,707
It was the day we got married..

136
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:45,041
...so I forced him to
get our picture taken. - I see.

137
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,291
What does your husband do?

138
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,999
We both were software engineers.

139
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,457
Firewall experts. - Firewall?

140
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:56,416
We make programs to save
computers from virus attacks.

141
00:13:56,666 --> 00:14:00,999
Like, the police..
protects the public. Right?

142
00:14:01,332 --> 00:14:02,624
Get this done quickly.

143
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,499
Arnab was supposed to come to London
after the assignment, but he didn't.

144
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:08,832
He suddenly vanished.

145
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,332
Vanished? - Yes,
I mean no messages, no calls.

146
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,207
And Arnab isn't like that.

147
00:14:14,457 --> 00:14:16,332
Where was he staying here?

148
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,999
Mona Lisa, 172A
- Sarat Bose Road.

149
00:14:22,332 --> 00:14:24,874
The place where he worked name?
- National Data Centre.

150
00:14:24,957 --> 00:14:28,082
Yes.- But they said that Arnab
never came there for any assignment.

151
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,124
He did, I know.

152
00:14:30,207 --> 00:14:32,082
We talked every day.

153
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:36,124
He would call me a thousand
times in a day and I would scold him.

154
00:14:36,374 --> 00:14:38,874
So that he doesn't spend his
entire earning on the phone bill.

155
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:40,791
But I don't know why they are lying.

156
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:45,207
The case is slightly complicated.

157
00:14:45,332 --> 00:14:47,124
I will do my best. It will be done.

158
00:14:47,374 --> 00:14:49,207
It will take some time.
I will get it done.

159
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,707
Madam, you will need to sign this.

160
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,124
Sign, sign.

161
00:14:56,624 --> 00:14:58,874
Why are you after that thing?

162
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,124
Leave it.

163
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:01,707
May I help?

164
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,332
You? - Oh yes,
you are a computer person..

165
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,999
Take a look.

166
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:12,207
What a pain..

167
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:19,124
You just needed to clear some memory.

168
00:15:19,624 --> 00:15:20,999
You won't face any problem now.

169
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,332
Are you satisfied now?

170
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,832
Now, madam, you just need to
sign and you're free to go.

171
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:29,999
What happened, madam?

172
00:15:30,082 --> 00:15:31,124
Sit, sit.

173
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,999
Would you like some water?

174
00:15:35,374 --> 00:15:37,332
Will you call a taxi for me, please?

175
00:15:37,457 --> 00:15:39,874
Why, Taxi? Rana will drop you.

176
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:42,916
Rana, go drop her. Go.

177
00:15:43,082 --> 00:15:44,166
Come.

178
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,499
How much further?

179
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,124
Its close-by.

180
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:07,207
Are you feeling better now?

181
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:12,457
Is this your first visit to Kolkata?

182
00:16:12,582 --> 00:16:13,916
Yes.

183
00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:20,416
Entire Kolkata is getting
ready for the Puja, right.

184
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,832
So you know about "Durga Puja'?

185
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,999
I have a Bengali husband remember..

186
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:32,999
By the way, your name Vidya is
also a very common Bengali name.

187
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,624
Vidya.

188
00:16:35,249 --> 00:16:36,166
I know.

189
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,082
Courtesy Mr. Chatterjee.

190
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,707
By the way, why do they call you Rana?

191
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:44,499
Your name.. The name
tag reads Satyoki.

192
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,707
In Kolkata everyone has two names.

193
00:16:47,832 --> 00:16:49,999
One is 'Dak' name, which is
pet name like mine is Rana.

194
00:16:50,124 --> 00:16:52,957
And the other is
'Bhalo' name, official name.

195
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:54,166
Satyoki.

196
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,541
But everyone
addresses me by my pet name.

197
00:16:57,457 --> 00:17:01,957
Interesting. Two names
for the same person.

198
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:03,624
Two identities.

199
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,999
Satyoki. Arjun's charioteer.

200
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,166
Guesthouse?

201
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:18,707
Have we reached the hotel?

202
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,332
Mrs. Bagchi, this
doesn't look like a hotel.

203
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,582
Are you sure this is the place?

204
00:17:39,707 --> 00:17:41,166
That's the address.

205
00:17:42,874 --> 00:17:44,999
Why would your husband stay here?

206
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,166
I don't know.

207
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,624
Come.

208
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:14,832
Good evening. Are
you the manager here?

209
00:18:14,957 --> 00:18:16,499
Yes.

210
00:18:16,582 --> 00:18:18,957
I am Vidya Bagchi. I had
called you from London..

211
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:20,791
...about my husband Arnab.

212
00:18:20,874 --> 00:18:23,332
Yes, yes. Arnab Bagchi.

213
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,999
Your Majesty, you..
- Look, I am not the queen.

214
00:18:26,082 --> 00:18:27,374
You can call me Vidya.

215
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:30,791
Bidya madam, when you
called from London..

216
00:18:30,957 --> 00:18:34,666
...I told you that your
husband wasn't staying here.

217
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,457
The situation is
still the same. Arnab..

218
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,332
You've been saying
that all the while..

219
00:18:38,457 --> 00:18:39,791
...and that's exactly why I came here.

220
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:43,291
I know this because he would
talk to me everyday from right here.

221
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:45,707
Sir, please explain to her..
- Wait, wait.

222
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,624
Mrs. Bagchi, maybe
there's a confusion.

223
00:18:47,707 --> 00:18:49,291
There's absolutely no confusion.

224
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:50,457
Arnab was staying here.

225
00:18:50,582 --> 00:18:52,791
This man is lying.
Show me your records.

226
00:18:52,874 --> 00:18:54,332
Register. Get the register.

227
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,374
This.

228
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:02,291
Are these your records?

229
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,291
Yes. - Don't you have a computer?

230
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:08,332
Computer? - Madam, only 5-star
hotels have computers.

231
00:19:08,457 --> 00:19:09,832
This is a guesthouse.

232
00:19:09,957 --> 00:19:11,124
0-star.

233
00:19:13,874 --> 00:19:15,957
Arnab stayed here
and I can prove that.

234
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,041
If you walk towards the lift..

235
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,249
...there's a peacock statue there.

236
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:20,332
Arnab used to say that..

237
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,916
...The peacock of Tamil Nadu
has followed me here too.

238
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:24,249
Which way is the lift?

239
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:25,541
That way.

240
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,707
Is it or not? - There is.

241
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,374
Then? - There is a peacock.

242
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:31,124
But your husband isn't here.

243
00:19:31,207 --> 00:19:33,374
I mean, he wasn't.
- You think this is a joke?

244
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:34,999
The peacock's really there.

245
00:19:35,082 --> 00:19:37,249
But how do you know? - Exactly.

246
00:19:37,332 --> 00:19:40,416
If Arnab didn't tell me
about it, then how do I know?

247
00:19:40,624 --> 00:19:42,832
I don't know why everyone's lying.

248
00:19:42,957 --> 00:19:45,666
What, sir? Talk to me.

249
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,374
Arnab wasn't staying here, right?

250
00:19:47,457 --> 00:19:48,374
But I will.

251
00:19:48,457 --> 00:19:49,916
I will stay in room no.15.

252
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,124
Mrs. Bagchi, are you sure.

253
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:52,749
I am absolutely sure.

254
00:19:52,874 --> 00:19:54,041
Will you give me the key?

255
00:19:57,957 --> 00:19:59,166
Sign here.

256
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:01,999
Here?

257
00:22:01,749 --> 00:22:03,999
'My dear wife, Why are
you standing at the door?'

258
00:22:04,082 --> 00:22:05,457
'You are so late'

259
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,291
'I've been waiting for so long
even your phone was unreachable.'

260
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:09,999
'And what if I hadn't returned?'

261
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:13,416
'Then I would've kept waiting..'

262
00:23:44,832 --> 00:23:45,999
It started raining suddenly.

263
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,499
Business is down.

264
00:23:47,624 --> 00:23:48,832
Absolutely. - Exactly.

265
00:23:49,624 --> 00:23:51,249
Your maj.. No.

266
00:23:51,332 --> 00:23:52,916
Good morning, Bidya madam.

267
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:54,166
Its Vidya, not Bidya.

268
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,624
V, not B.

269
00:23:55,749 --> 00:23:57,082
Whatever you say, Bidya madam.

270
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,499
There's no hot water in the room.

271
00:23:59,624 --> 00:24:01,624
I know. - You.. You know.

272
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:04,457
Then why did you put up a
board saying 'Running hot-water...

273
00:24:05,957 --> 00:24:06,916
That?

274
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,124
I tell you.

275
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:09,749
Bishnu. Bishnu.

276
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,666
Come here. Come here.

277
00:24:11,874 --> 00:24:12,916
Come.

278
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:14,124
Madam, he's Bishnu.

279
00:24:14,957 --> 00:24:17,416
If you want hot
water then call Bishnu.

280
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,332
He will come running
with the hot water.

281
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,666
Running hot water ..our Bishnu.

282
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:26,582
How do I go to Camac Street?

283
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,582
You will get a bus, or a taxi outside.

284
00:24:28,749 --> 00:24:29,999
Bishnu, show madam.

285
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:31,332
Come Didi. - Come on.

286
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,124
What is that? - Don't ask for that.

287
00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:36,082
That's his radio. His life.
He will never give it.

288
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:37,916
Come on.

289
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,457
You called me Didi right?

290
00:24:39,582 --> 00:24:41,041
So that makes my brother right?

291
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:42,999
Give me a five, brother.

292
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:11,541
Good morning, sir. - Good morning.

293
00:25:11,624 --> 00:25:13,041
Please call Mrs. Bagchi.

294
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:14,791
Madam left for Camel street.

295
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:17,707
Hi. I am here to meet Agnes D'mello.

296
00:25:17,832 --> 00:25:19,499
Do you have an appointment? - Yes.

297
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:20,999
Your name, madam?

298
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:25,624
Vidya Bagchi. - Bidya Bagchi.

299
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:28,332
Nothing.

300
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:31,499
Bidya Bagchi.

301
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,957
Darling, I told you this
when you called me from London.

302
00:25:46,332 --> 00:25:50,707
Your husband didn't come to
my company for any assignment.

303
00:25:51,374 --> 00:25:53,041
I am the HR manager.

304
00:25:53,457 --> 00:25:56,166
I approve every assignment.

305
00:25:56,666 --> 00:26:01,249
And I didn't sanction any
assignment for any Arnab Bagchi.

306
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:07,124
Arnab.

307
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:11,291
No. He didn't come here.

308
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:13,249
He did. I sent him.

309
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:14,999
'I don't want to go to Kolkata.'

310
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:17,332
am on a holiday.'

311
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:19,749
'It's just a question of
two weeks, I'll be okay.'

312
00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:21,624
'You're crying like a girl'

313
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,374
'You are actually packing my bag.'

314
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:29,749
'Wifey, please. They
will find someone else.'

315
00:26:29,874 --> 00:26:32,207
'And I will stay right
here and look after you.'

316
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,166
'Cooking, washing.'

317
00:26:35,749 --> 00:26:37,249
'That's what I am afraid of.'

318
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:40,207
<i>I will be okay, go.'</i>

319
00:26:49,249 --> 00:26:50,666
Please help me Didi..

320
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:51,999
Please help me.

321
00:26:52,124 --> 00:26:54,291
I don't know what to do.

322
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:57,582
Yes! - There's a police officer
who wants to see you.

323
00:26:57,874 --> 00:26:58,999
Me?

324
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:05,707
Bye. - Bye.

325
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,041
Poor girl.

326
00:28:21,374 --> 00:28:22,832
Mrs. Bagchi.

327
00:28:24,832 --> 00:28:26,082
This way.

328
00:28:36,957 --> 00:28:38,124
Show it.

329
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:49,749
Let it be.

330
00:28:49,957 --> 00:28:51,249
Mrs. Bagchi.

331
00:29:05,124 --> 00:29:06,582
That wasn't Arnab.

332
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:15,666
Mrs. Bagchi, doesn't Arnab
have any relatives in Kolkata.

333
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:18,249
Uncle or anyone?

334
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:22,999
He has an uncle.

335
00:29:23,207 --> 00:29:24,999
He stays in Thakurpukur.

336
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:45,624
Here Here here (in tamil)

337
00:29:46,374 --> 00:29:47,541
Meaning?

338
00:29:48,332 --> 00:29:49,582
Arnab's school.

339
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:52,166
Kalagachhia Kailash
Kamini High School.

340
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,332
I see. - I have heard
lot of stories about it.

341
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:59,791
Rana. That means uncle's
house must be close-by.

342
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:02,332
Let's go that way.

343
00:30:17,957 --> 00:30:21,166
Rana. I should've worn a sari, right?
Just hold this.

344
00:30:21,457 --> 00:30:23,291
Sari? You wear a sari as well.

345
00:30:23,499 --> 00:30:24,832
Do you have one?

346
00:30:26,582 --> 00:30:29,082
Don't worry, Mrs. Bagchi.
You are looking nice.

347
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:30,374
Come.

348
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:32,582
I am meeting them for the first time.
- I know..

349
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,832
Arnab Bagchi. - No.

350
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:38,957
Then, does any other
Bagchi family live around here?

351
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:41,624
Look, madam. We've been
living here for the past 30 years.

352
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:43,999
But we never heard of
any Bagchi family..

353
00:30:44,124 --> 00:30:47,582
...or any Arnab Bagchi.

354
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:52,874
Thank you. - Who is Arnab Bagchi?

355
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:54,082
Thank you.

356
00:30:57,832 --> 00:30:59,374
Can you come in, please?

357
00:31:08,332 --> 00:31:09,999
What happened? Been punished?

358
00:31:10,124 --> 00:31:11,082
What is this?

359
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,999
This is a flying swan.

360
00:31:13,124 --> 00:31:15,082
I see, that's a flying swan. - Yes.

361
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,082
It looks more like a dead duck to me.

362
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:18,624
Okay, see you.

363
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:34,082
No, dear. There was no
Arnab Bagchi that year.

364
00:31:34,582 --> 00:31:37,082
Why can't I access
Milan Damji's record?

365
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:38,707
Its showing me Restricted each time.

366
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:41,082
Madam, I will need Mr.
Tyagi's permission to unlock it

367
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:42,832
Where is Tyagi?

368
00:31:42,957 --> 00:31:43,999
He's on leave today.

369
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:17,582
Coming, mother.

370
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:41,999
Hello. - Agnes.

371
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:43,582
Yes. - Hi.

372
00:32:43,749 --> 00:32:45,166
Can you meet me tomorrow?

373
00:32:45,332 --> 00:32:46,999
Of course. - At 3 o'clock.

374
00:32:47,249 --> 00:32:49,957
Where? - There's a restaurant
at Park Street.

375
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:51,832
Mocambo. - Mocambo.

376
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:53,374
See you. - Take care.

377
00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:54,291
Bye.

378
00:33:11,624 --> 00:33:12,874
Bishnu.

379
00:33:15,666 --> 00:33:16,582
Bishnu!

380
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:18,249
Coming Didi..

381
00:33:24,832 --> 00:33:26,416
Watch it. - Move aside.

382
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:31,999
Here you go.

383
00:33:32,457 --> 00:33:33,416
Radio?

384
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:39,124
Kalighat.

385
00:33:40,582 --> 00:33:41,707
Just a minute.

386
00:33:41,832 --> 00:33:44,749
Rana. Call from the airport.

387
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:48,166
Hello. - Better explain
to that Bidya Bagchi.

388
00:33:48,624 --> 00:33:50,999
Yes, yes, yes.
- That Arnab or whoever..

389
00:33:51,082 --> 00:33:53,291
...got her pregnant and ran away.
These things keep happening.

390
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:54,249
Hello?

391
00:33:54,374 --> 00:33:57,874
Tell her not to waste time here in
this condition and return to London.

392
00:33:57,999 --> 00:33:59,082
Oh, so you checked?

393
00:33:59,749 --> 00:34:01,624
I have been thinking about
it for the past 30 years.

394
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:03,374
But he ran away in 2.

395
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:06,457
Sorry, can you say it again please.

396
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:08,499
Would you like a cup of tea, sir?

397
00:34:08,999 --> 00:34:10,207
No, its fine. Thank you.

398
00:34:12,124 --> 00:34:13,166
Hi.

399
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:17,957
Mr. Das.

400
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:18,999
Good morning, madam.

401
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:20,041
Good afternoon, Mr. Das.

402
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,791
Whatever you say, madam.
- Good afternoon, Rana.

403
00:34:21,916 --> 00:34:23,041
Good afternoon.

404
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:25,874
Radio.

405
00:34:26,249 --> 00:34:27,249
Are you going anywhere?

406
00:34:27,374 --> 00:34:28,624
To meet Agnes.

407
00:34:28,749 --> 00:34:29,999
I will drop you there.

408
00:34:30,249 --> 00:34:32,249
I won't need your
chariot today, Satyoki.

409
00:34:32,374 --> 00:34:34,041
My taxi is waiting.

410
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:36,207
Okay.

411
00:34:38,499 --> 00:34:40,707
Mrs. Bagchi, we checked..

412
00:34:40,832 --> 00:34:42,666
...with Kolkata and
London's immigration departments.

413
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:45,041
The date that you told us..

414
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,999
...no Arnab Bagchi left from London..

415
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:50,541
...or arrived in Kolkata.

416
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:52,999
Then surely there's a
mistake in the system.

417
00:34:53,707 --> 00:34:55,832
We double-checked it.
Triple-checked it.

418
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:58,416
The facts are correct.

419
00:35:19,624 --> 00:35:22,874
Yesterday after you left I
took a close look at the photo.

420
00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:24,207
And you know what.

421
00:35:24,332 --> 00:35:26,666
Your husband looks exactly like..

422
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,999
...an ex-employee of ours.

423
00:35:29,124 --> 00:35:30,291
Milan Damji.

424
00:35:30,499 --> 00:35:32,332
Who? - Milan Damji.

425
00:35:32,457 --> 00:35:34,999
He left 2 years ago..

426
00:35:35,124 --> 00:35:36,541
He was a funny one.

427
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:37,999
He would keep to himself.

428
00:35:38,124 --> 00:35:40,999
He joined suddenly
and even left suddenly.

429
00:35:41,499 --> 00:35:43,041
His blood group was funny as well.

430
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,999
Bombay blood group.

431
00:35:45,124 --> 00:35:48,541
I clearly remember the
day he left the company.

432
00:35:48,832 --> 00:35:51,166
A lot of people came looking for him.

433
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:52,999
But he vanished!

434
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:53,957
Poof.

435
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:56,249
But what is the connection with Arnab?

436
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:58,124
Two years ago he was in London.

437
00:35:58,207 --> 00:36:01,624
Milan Damji looks exactly like Arnab.

438
00:36:01,832 --> 00:36:03,999
That's why yesterday I tried..

439
00:36:04,082 --> 00:36:06,541
...to get his photo from the computer.

440
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:08,874
But it would always
show me the same message..

441
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:10,791
...Restricted.
Restricted. Restricted.

442
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:13,291
God knows how to
operate these computers!

443
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:15,374
Tomorrow when Tyagi returns..

444
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:16,582
Tyagi?

445
00:36:18,582 --> 00:36:19,874
Tyagi here.

446
00:36:24,874 --> 00:36:26,624
Who wants Milan Damji's records?

447
00:36:26,832 --> 00:36:28,916
If I can't access the computer..

448
00:36:28,999 --> 00:36:31,999
...there are some employee
records are in the old office.

449
00:36:32,499 --> 00:36:34,791
Maybe there's a photo in that.

450
00:36:35,082 --> 00:36:38,999
Agnes, thank you but..

451
00:36:39,082 --> 00:36:40,166
What will I do seeing Milan's photo?

452
00:36:40,249 --> 00:36:42,457
Just see Milan Damji's photo once.

453
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:44,082
Then decide.

454
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:58,874
Bob.

455
00:37:03,082 --> 00:37:04,041
Bob.

456
00:37:04,582 --> 00:37:06,541
You can't do anything.

457
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:08,041
The figures are so bad.

458
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:10,457
You can't get a single
life insurance client.

459
00:37:10,582 --> 00:37:14,166
If this goes on then soon you
will be fired from this job.

460
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:17,624
For God's sake, switch off the phone..

461
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:19,457
...and concentrate on your target.

462
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:20,499
Client, sir.

463
00:37:20,582 --> 00:37:21,749
Disgusting.

464
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:51,874
Yes.

465
00:37:52,124 --> 00:37:53,291
Hello.

466
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:54,707
Hello.

467
00:37:54,832 --> 00:37:55,999
Agnes D'Mello.

468
00:37:56,124 --> 00:37:57,124
Yes.

469
00:37:57,207 --> 00:37:58,082
One minute

470
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,082
Oh she wears a wig!

471
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:47,374
Good morning, sir.

472
00:38:48,082 --> 00:38:49,416
Sir, he's in a meeting.

473
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:53,166
Gentlemen, we've to
ensure that we do this.

474
00:38:58,041 --> 00:38:59,249
Excuse me.

475
00:39:02,957 --> 00:39:06,916
I've to go to
Kolkata today, right now.

476
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:10,332
Why? - No smoking
in the building, Khan.

477
00:39:10,457 --> 00:39:13,541
I know. - Someone shot
NDC's HR manager.

478
00:39:13,749 --> 00:39:14,999
So.

479
00:39:15,082 --> 00:39:17,166
That's the local
police station's case.

480
00:39:17,249 --> 00:39:19,541
Why do you have to go
to Kolkata for that?

481
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:22,166
She was trying to
access Milan's record.

482
00:39:25,707 --> 00:39:27,082
What other information do we have?

483
00:39:27,207 --> 00:39:29,541
There's a pregnant lady,
from London.

484
00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:31,332
Vidya Bagchi.

485
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:36,832
Listen, on the seventh day..

486
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,749
I need this room empty for a while.

487
00:39:38,832 --> 00:39:40,166
Everyone go out.

488
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:42,291
What?

489
00:39:44,332 --> 00:39:45,416
Didn't you hear?

490
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:47,082
I need this room empty.

491
00:39:48,749 --> 00:39:49,999
Who are you?

492
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:54,332
What is your name? Get out.
- Shut the.. Khan.

493
00:39:54,832 --> 00:39:57,541
That's my name Shut the.. Khan.

494
00:39:58,499 --> 00:39:59,666
Anything else?

495
00:39:59,957 --> 00:40:01,999
No, sir. - Call Vidya Bagchi.

496
00:40:02,124 --> 00:40:03,874
I want her here in 10 minutes.

497
00:40:04,124 --> 00:40:05,457
Okay, sir.

498
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:10,124
Tell me.

499
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:13,957
I am pregnant woman, sir.

500
00:40:13,999 --> 00:40:16,416
You shouldn't be
smoking in front of me.

501
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:20,041
Mrs. Bagchi, we don't
know much about each other.

502
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:23,249
So leave it to me about
what I should or shouldn't do.

503
00:40:23,332 --> 00:40:25,791
Let's come to the point. Tell me.

504
00:40:26,374 --> 00:40:27,916
How are you related to Agnes?

505
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:31,999
My husband Arnab Bagchi is missing.

506
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,166
What happened? Why
is everyone outside?

507
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:38,166
That Vidya Bagchi, it's a big problem.

508
00:40:38,249 --> 00:40:39,041
Really? - Yes.

509
00:40:39,124 --> 00:40:40,291
What are you saying?

510
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:43,999
Mrs. Bagchi.

511
00:40:44,499 --> 00:40:45,707
What is going on?

512
00:40:45,957 --> 00:40:47,207
Look.. - Who are you?

513
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:48,999
Look, I am talking to her. - Out.

514
00:40:49,082 --> 00:40:50,582
But who are you? - Out.

515
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,582
Close the door behind you.

516
00:40:58,707 --> 00:40:59,874
Out!

517
00:41:02,249 --> 00:41:03,874
Yes, so what were you saying?

518
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:08,916
Who is he?

519
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:12,416
Arnab's face resembles an
ex-employee Milan Damji.

520
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:16,082
And Agnes.. - There was never
an employee called Milan there.

521
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:19,291
I feel Agnes got it wrong

522
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:21,041
Are you sure?

523
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:23,957
Because I remember correctly..

524
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:26,207
...that Agnes said Milan Damji.

525
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:33,082
Mrs. Bagchi, I know more
about NDC than you and Agnes.

526
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,999
2000 employees work there, understand.

527
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:39,999
I am quite sure.

528
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:42,249
Yes, she also said that..

529
00:41:42,332 --> 00:41:45,999
...when she tried to
access Milan Damji's record..

530
00:41:46,124 --> 00:41:48,332
...she kept getting Restricted..
- You aren't listening to me.

531
00:41:48,457 --> 00:41:49,791
Are you listening?

532
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:55,791
There was no one called Milan.

533
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:59,207
No, inspector I am
sure Agnes said Milan.

534
00:41:59,332 --> 00:42:01,291
Do you understand what I am saying?

535
00:42:01,624 --> 00:42:03,332
There's no one called Milan there.

536
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:05,041
You are still stuck on Milan.

537
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:06,666
Don't you understand what I am saying?

538
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,041
Milan. Milan. Milan.

539
00:42:08,124 --> 00:42:09,499
Out!

540
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:15,832
Look, I..

541
00:42:17,374 --> 00:42:20,041
Mrs. Bagchi. Look here.

542
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,874
I am giving you a free advice,
although I don't.

543
00:42:26,457 --> 00:42:28,999
Get over with whatever you came
here to do and leave for London.

544
00:42:29,957 --> 00:42:32,082
That will be best for
you in this condition.

545
00:42:32,207 --> 00:42:33,457
Do you understand?

546
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:37,707
Mr. Khan.

547
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:41,249
We don't know each other..

548
00:42:41,457 --> 00:42:46,707
...So leave it to me about
what I should or shouldn't do.

549
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:50,957
And anyway, you
don't give free advices..

550
00:42:51,374 --> 00:42:52,666
That's good.

551
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:54,582
You shouldn't either.

552
00:42:54,999 --> 00:42:56,207
Quiet.

553
00:42:56,916 --> 00:42:58,207
Sir, sorry.

554
00:42:59,832 --> 00:43:01,457
Take all this inside.

555
00:43:02,874 --> 00:43:04,582
Mrs. Bagchi, I will drop you.

556
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:05,916
Come.

557
00:43:06,457 --> 00:43:08,582
No, no, no. No need to worry, sir.

558
00:43:08,707 --> 00:43:10,082
It's a simple case.

559
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:11,916
Actually.

560
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:17,707
Agnes confused her husband with Milan.

561
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:21,541
That Vidya Bagchi.

562
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:24,041
Her husband got her
pregnant and disappeared.

563
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:26,457
No, no, she is completely harmless.

564
00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:30,166
I will get her background checked.
Don't worry at all.

565
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:33,666
Don't waste time on
that pregnant woman, Khan.

566
00:43:34,124 --> 00:43:36,082
Tell me about Milan.

567
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:45,207
Give me Captain Bajpai.

568
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:51,999
Yes.
- For God's sake get a mobile, Bajpai.

569
00:43:52,082 --> 00:43:54,041
Why? Why do I need a mobile?

570
00:43:54,124 --> 00:43:55,957
I stay at home the entire day.

571
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:58,457
When can you come to the office?

572
00:43:58,541 --> 00:43:59,541
Why?

573
00:43:59,624 --> 00:44:03,041
I needed to discuss
something important with you..

574
00:44:03,957 --> 00:44:05,666
...about Milan Damji.

575
00:44:07,332 --> 00:44:08,582
Hello?

576
00:44:09,582 --> 00:44:10,541
Bajpai?

577
00:44:10,624 --> 00:44:11,791
I'm here, go on.

578
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:13,832
Can you come to the office?

579
00:44:15,082 --> 00:44:16,207
No.

580
00:44:31,374 --> 00:44:34,416
Rana. If I address
someone by his first name..

581
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:36,291
...then what does it mean?

582
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:39,249
That you know him really well.

583
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:41,957
'There's no one called Milan there.'

584
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:43,374
'Actually there is no Milan.'

585
00:44:43,499 --> 00:44:44,999
'Milan. Milan. Milan.'

586
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:46,999
According to Khan,
Milan Damji is someone..

587
00:44:47,124 --> 00:44:48,749
...who doesn't exist at all.

588
00:44:50,374 --> 00:44:52,832
Yet, he said Milan
instead of Milan Damji.

589
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:54,207
Why?

590
00:44:55,832 --> 00:44:57,124
I am going to NDC.

591
00:44:57,207 --> 00:44:59,416
If I find out anything,
I will call you.

592
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:05,707
No, sir. There is no
Milan Damji in our records.

593
00:45:05,999 --> 00:45:08,749
How long have you been working here?

594
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:10,541
Sir, 1 and half years.

595
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:13,874
And you never heard
the name of Milan Damji?

596
00:45:13,999 --> 00:45:15,999
No, sir. - Sapna, do you..

597
00:45:17,332 --> 00:45:18,582
You?

598
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:21,916
Sir, he was inquiring about
Agnes D'mello's murder case.

599
00:45:22,916 --> 00:45:25,082
Do you have any authorization?

600
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:27,582
I am standing right behind you?

601
00:45:27,707 --> 00:45:29,332
Whose name is Rana?

602
00:45:30,332 --> 00:45:32,832
Sir. I am Rana.

603
00:45:33,416 --> 00:45:34,582
Why did you go there?

604
00:45:34,707 --> 00:45:35,999
With whose permission?

605
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:37,791
Without any permission, or a warrant.

606
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:39,957
To hell with the warrant,
first tell me..

607
00:45:39,999 --> 00:45:41,874
Why do you have to
conduct a local investigation..

608
00:45:41,999 --> 00:45:43,666
...when this is an IB case?

609
00:45:44,249 --> 00:45:45,999
Next time if I see you following up..

610
00:45:46,082 --> 00:45:47,874
...without my permission.

611
00:45:47,957 --> 00:45:49,666
Then you will be
telling the traffic police..

612
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,666
...about the traffic from
the control room, understand.

613
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,999
No, sir, actually..
- Did I ask you? Did I ask you?

614
00:45:55,832 --> 00:45:57,416
Will you work for the traffic control?

615
00:45:57,707 --> 00:45:59,082
Do you want to work
for the traffic control?

616
00:45:59,916 --> 00:46:01,166
Out.

617
00:46:01,249 --> 00:46:02,666
Who else?

618
00:46:02,749 --> 00:46:04,541
Do you? Out.

619
00:46:09,832 --> 00:46:11,166
What?

620
00:46:11,249 --> 00:46:12,791
Didn't you understand what I said?

621
00:46:12,874 --> 00:46:14,082
Out.

622
00:46:18,249 --> 00:46:19,957
How long have you
been doing service?

623
00:46:20,957 --> 00:46:22,457
Six months, sir.

624
00:46:22,707 --> 00:46:24,041
Do you love your job?

625
00:46:25,124 --> 00:46:26,707
Do you want to keep working?

626
00:46:26,832 --> 00:46:27,999
Yes, sir.

627
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:43,457
Mrs. Bagchi, I think
Khan sir is right.

628
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:45,374
Agnes must be confused with someone.

629
00:46:45,499 --> 00:46:49,874
See, NDC has at least
2000 employees.. - Exactly, Rana.

630
00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:51,916
2000 employees work in NDC..

631
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:54,582
...so why did Agnes
take Milan Damji's name?

632
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:56,916
She wasn't wrong?

633
00:46:57,041 --> 00:46:59,082
And you know, Agnes
never said anything..

634
00:46:59,207 --> 00:47:01,707
...until she hadn't seen
Arnab's photo properly.

635
00:47:10,374 --> 00:47:11,541
What happened?

636
00:47:11,666 --> 00:47:14,332
Why are those women
wearing such a sari?

637
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:16,749
Them? - The red and white sari.

638
00:47:16,874 --> 00:47:19,374
They wear it on any auspicious day.

639
00:47:19,457 --> 00:47:20,916
But why?

640
00:47:21,707 --> 00:47:23,624
"White sari with red border?

641
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:25,082
"Why should I wear that?"

642
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:26,082
'Why? Why?"

643
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:27,374
'It's traditional.'

644
00:47:27,457 --> 00:47:28,957
'Everyone wears that on
the last day of Durga Puja.'

645
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:30,582
'Everyone, even men?'

646
00:47:34,041 --> 00:47:36,624
'I will get you one when I
go to Kolkata, Mrs. Bagchi.'

647
00:47:36,707 --> 00:47:38,749
'And trust me, even
you will look awesome.'

648
00:47:39,874 --> 00:47:41,082
<i>"What?"</i>

649
00:47:45,749 --> 00:47:47,166
<i>"What?"</i>

650
00:47:48,874 --> 00:47:51,499
'Mr. Vidya Bagchi, don't bore me.'

651
00:47:51,624 --> 00:47:54,832
'And drop this stupid idea
of making me wear a sari.'

652
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:59,874
'Just go to Kolkata
quietly and come back quickly.'

653
00:48:04,124 --> 00:48:06,832
And then I forced
him to go to Kolkata.

654
00:48:09,999 --> 00:48:11,624
He's an idiot as well.

655
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:13,999
He came here.

656
00:48:16,999 --> 00:48:19,624
He had this bad habit of
doing whatever I said.

657
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:35,999
I am sure you will find Arnab.

658
00:48:42,207 --> 00:48:44,624
Can I say something,
if you don't mind?

659
00:48:44,999 --> 00:48:47,999
That sari, the one
that woman was wearing.

660
00:48:48,332 --> 00:48:51,874
The day you find Arnab,
you can wear that sari.

661
00:48:52,332 --> 00:48:54,416
That will be the
auspicious day for you.

662
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:02,416
Arnab won't be found so easily.

663
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:04,957
I will have to look for him.

664
00:49:05,874 --> 00:49:07,749
That's the point, Mrs. Bagchi.

665
00:49:07,957 --> 00:49:09,374
How will we look for him?

666
00:49:10,416 --> 00:49:12,249
Milan Damji does not exist.

667
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:15,082
He's some story that
you believe to be true.

668
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:19,457
Rana.

669
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:21,041
Agnes said..

670
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,874
'The employee records
are in the old office.'

671
00:49:23,999 --> 00:49:26,416
'There might be a photo in it.'

672
00:49:28,124 --> 00:49:29,666
What are you saying?

673
00:49:30,499 --> 00:49:31,999
How can we barge
inside someone's office?

674
00:49:32,124 --> 00:49:33,624
That too, the National Data Centre.

675
00:49:33,749 --> 00:49:34,999
But it's closed down.

676
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:36,166
Sapna. - Yes, sir.

677
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:38,749
Do you have hard copies of
the old employees records?

678
00:49:38,832 --> 00:49:40,832
No, sir. Everything's on the system.

679
00:49:40,957 --> 00:49:42,582
You sure? - Yes, sir.

680
00:49:42,874 --> 00:49:43,999
Sir.

681
00:49:44,124 --> 00:49:46,291
There might be some in the old office.

682
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:47,749
There's nothing here.

683
00:49:50,624 --> 00:49:52,832
Hello. - Write down, third floor.

684
00:49:56,374 --> 00:49:58,291
Third floor.

685
00:49:58,374 --> 00:50:00,374
12 R.N. Mukherjee Road.

686
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:03,832
It's the old NDC office.

687
00:50:03,999 --> 00:50:05,957
There's a file on Milan Damji..

688
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:07,707
Who is Milan Damji?

689
00:50:07,791 --> 00:50:09,999
No one. Just do as I say.

690
00:50:10,124 --> 00:50:11,874
Get the file. - Bob.

691
00:50:14,999 --> 00:50:16,249
Client.

692
00:50:17,374 --> 00:50:18,457
Good.

693
00:50:19,957 --> 00:50:21,291
Let's go.

694
00:50:32,499 --> 00:50:33,791
This one.

695
00:50:39,082 --> 00:50:41,082
Oh, God. That's a big lock.
I can't do it.

696
00:50:41,332 --> 00:50:42,957
Rana. Open it.

697
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:44,332
How?

698
00:50:45,707 --> 00:50:47,624
Mrs. Bagchi, I am
the police not a thief.

699
00:50:47,749 --> 00:50:48,916
Really?

700
00:50:49,291 --> 00:50:50,749
Open it.

701
00:50:52,832 --> 00:50:53,832
This is great.

702
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:57,416
The police is breaking and
entering himself. Very good.

703
00:51:29,041 --> 00:51:30,582
There are millions of files here.

704
00:51:30,707 --> 00:51:32,124
How will we find it?

705
00:51:36,624 --> 00:51:38,166
This is not done.

706
00:51:39,749 --> 00:51:41,374
We'll have to look
for the HR department.

707
00:51:41,457 --> 00:51:43,374
I am totally screwed
myself on this one (in Bengali)

708
00:51:43,457 --> 00:51:44,749
Meaning?

709
00:51:45,582 --> 00:51:47,041
I will explain that later.

710
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:54,916
What's written here? - Same. Xerox.

711
00:52:03,707 --> 00:52:04,999
This door.

712
00:52:06,082 --> 00:52:09,082
Chief accounts. No, no, no.

713
00:52:11,582 --> 00:52:13,291
Rana. H.R.D.

714
00:52:34,916 --> 00:52:36,166
Look there.

715
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:39,791
If it exists then it
must be somewhere here..

716
00:52:39,874 --> 00:52:40,832
...or it doesn't exist.

717
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:43,082
If Agnes has said it,
then it must be here.

718
00:52:50,249 --> 00:52:52,291
DE. DH. DU.

719
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:56,999
DS. DC. DDH.

720
00:52:57,124 --> 00:52:58,999
DA.

721
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:03,166
Mrs. Bagchi, hurry up. Please.

722
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:04,791
Just a minute, Rana.

723
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:09,582
Milan Damji.

724
00:54:14,416 --> 00:54:16,957
There was no file on Milan Damji.

725
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:18,832
Milan Damji exists.

726
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:20,082
Who is Milan Damji?

727
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:26,999
Where did you get this paper from?

728
00:54:27,416 --> 00:54:28,832
What difference does that make?

729
00:54:28,916 --> 00:54:31,166
Who is Milan Damji?
- Is he your husband?

730
00:54:31,707 --> 00:54:32,999
Take a good look.

731
00:54:33,624 --> 00:54:34,999
Is he your husband?

732
00:54:35,082 --> 00:54:36,291
Take a look.

733
00:54:36,416 --> 00:54:37,999
No. - He isn't.

734
00:54:38,332 --> 00:54:40,999
Then what difference does
it make about who he is.

735
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:44,957
Forget Milan Damji .and I will forget
where you got this paper from.

736
00:54:44,999 --> 00:54:46,124
End of matter.

737
00:54:46,207 --> 00:54:47,999
Milan Damji isn't Arnab.

738
00:54:48,374 --> 00:54:49,999
But he does look like Arnab..

739
00:54:50,124 --> 00:54:53,124
...and if something has
happened to my husband..

740
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,082
...because of that, then it is
very important for me to know..

741
00:54:55,207 --> 00:54:57,041
...who Milan Damji is.

742
00:54:58,249 --> 00:55:02,291
Either you tell me
or you leave it to me.

743
00:55:03,249 --> 00:55:05,749
I will find the answer
and come back to you.

744
00:55:07,457 --> 00:55:08,999
How will you find out?

745
00:55:13,416 --> 00:55:15,666
I will go out and ask every person.

746
00:55:17,499 --> 00:55:20,374
Even if he's a common man
on the streets, the police.

747
00:55:22,499 --> 00:55:23,791
Or the media?

748
00:55:25,832 --> 00:55:28,707
Someone will surely have
an answer to this question.

749
00:55:31,582 --> 00:55:32,957
Sit down, Mrs. Bagchi.

750
00:55:33,957 --> 00:55:34,999
Sit down.

751
00:55:41,999 --> 00:55:45,791
Do you know anything about the attack
on Kolkata Metro two years ago?

752
00:55:46,832 --> 00:55:48,041
Yes.

753
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:50,624
Milan Damji was behind that attack.

754
00:55:51,166 --> 00:55:53,457
He's the prime suspect in this case.

755
00:55:56,207 --> 00:55:59,249
Then why doesn't anyone
know about Milan Damji.

756
00:55:59,374 --> 00:56:02,416
Milan Damji doesn't exist
for the world, that's why.

757
00:56:03,457 --> 00:56:04,874
He didn't exist for me either.

758
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:07,916
Until the day I was
given the task to catch him.

759
00:56:08,374 --> 00:56:10,207
But until then it was too late.

760
00:56:10,791 --> 00:56:12,916
Milan disappeared and
so did all his reports.

761
00:56:12,999 --> 00:56:16,249
But how can anyone just disappear?
- It can be our agents.

762
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:18,207
Milan was a government agent.

763
00:56:18,332 --> 00:56:19,957
He betrayed us. Joined
hands with the enemy.

764
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:22,249
We have been hiding
this from the people.

765
00:56:22,582 --> 00:56:26,707
Not just that, there's someone
in our system who is helping Milan.

766
00:56:27,707 --> 00:56:29,916
This is a dangerous game,
Mrs. Bagchi.

767
00:56:33,249 --> 00:56:35,666
Those who want to keep Milan
safe are very powerful people.

768
00:56:35,749 --> 00:56:37,374
They can do anything.

769
00:56:54,707 --> 00:56:56,166
Hello.

770
00:56:56,374 --> 00:56:57,749
Madam.

771
00:56:58,374 --> 00:57:00,666
Madam. I am so sorry.

772
00:57:00,749 --> 00:57:02,749
It was a mistake.

773
00:57:02,832 --> 00:57:04,374
Are you alright?

774
00:57:04,457 --> 00:57:06,082
I saved you today.

775
00:57:06,166 --> 00:57:07,541
My reflexes.

776
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:08,749
What if I can't save you tomorrow?

777
00:57:08,832 --> 00:57:11,416
Oh, God. One
shouldn't think like that.

778
00:57:11,541 --> 00:57:14,166
You and your child should stay safe.

779
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:15,957
I will pray to God for that.

780
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:17,957
I will pray to God for that.

781
00:57:18,499 --> 00:57:19,541
Madam.

782
00:57:19,624 --> 00:57:22,332
Madam. Kolkata, dangerous city.

783
00:57:22,457 --> 00:57:23,749
Right?

784
00:57:23,832 --> 00:57:26,582
Anything can happen here at anytime.

785
00:57:26,666 --> 00:57:28,249
I am telling her for her own good.

786
00:57:28,374 --> 00:57:29,666
Go back.

787
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:32,499
Go back, madam. Go back.

788
00:57:32,624 --> 00:57:35,582
Very dangerous city, Kolkata.

789
00:57:39,124 --> 00:57:40,041
No.

790
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,582
I don't want to come back.

791
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:46,624
You can have your bureau, your system.

792
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:48,374
One project.

793
00:57:48,457 --> 00:57:50,166
Just one project failed.

794
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:52,582
That doesn't mean we
shut down the bureau?

795
00:57:52,707 --> 00:57:54,666
Shut down the system..
- Just one project

796
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:57,999
How easily you can
say that, Bhaskaran?

797
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:01,207
Just one project. - You gave me
this assignment, Bhaskaran.

798
00:58:02,041 --> 00:58:03,374
Pick three ordinary guys, train them..

799
00:58:03,499 --> 00:58:05,791
...and turn them into
bureau's best agents.

800
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:07,124
And what did I do?

801
00:58:07,249 --> 00:58:08,707
I created a monster.

802
00:58:10,166 --> 00:58:11,624
I found two good people..

803
00:58:11,707 --> 00:58:13,791
...but an animal like Milan
Damji got trained as well.

804
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:17,374
And he joined hands with
those he had to save us from.

805
00:58:17,832 --> 00:58:22,832
He killed the very
civilians I trained him to protect.

806
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:26,457
We will find Milan,
you just come back.

807
00:58:26,582 --> 00:58:29,499
You cannot find Milan,
Bhaskaran, that's the point.

808
00:58:29,582 --> 00:58:32,582
I trained him. You cannot find him.

809
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:35,832
Only fools like you
and me can be found..

810
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:39,874
...who keep ranting
Our system is perfect.

811
00:58:39,957 --> 00:58:41,457
Law has the upper hand.

812
00:58:41,582 --> 00:58:43,999
There is no
corruption in our system.

813
00:58:44,082 --> 00:58:46,082
Everything is hunky-dory.

814
00:58:47,249 --> 00:58:48,541
Bhaskaran.

815
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:53,291
One man helped Milan Damji to escape.

816
00:58:53,999 --> 00:58:55,791
That man is still
working in your bureau..

817
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:58,041
...right under your nose.

818
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:03,166
The day you find him,
that day I will come back.

819
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:17,082
Rana, three things are possible.

820
00:59:17,166 --> 00:59:18,374
One..

821
00:59:19,957 --> 00:59:22,041
Arnab has left me and ran away.

822
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:25,624
Two..

823
00:59:26,374 --> 00:59:28,749
Arnab and Milan Damji
are the same person.

824
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:30,041
And third..

825
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:32,291
Arnab looks just like Milan Damji..

826
00:59:32,416 --> 00:59:34,916
...and that's why Arnab's in trouble.

827
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:36,707
That must have happened.

828
00:59:37,582 --> 00:59:42,874
So you are saying that Arnab looks
like him and so.. - I am sure.

829
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:45,374
We will have to find
Milan in order to find Arnab.

830
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:49,124
And the day we find Milan,
we will find Arnab.

831
00:59:50,124 --> 00:59:52,082
Mrs. Bagchi, how is that possible?

832
00:59:52,207 --> 00:59:53,999
Where do we start looking for someone
we don't know anything about?

833
00:59:54,124 --> 00:59:55,457
From his house.

834
00:59:55,957 --> 00:59:59,707
Meaning? - I mean Agnes's file had
Milan Damji's home address.

835
01:00:17,749 --> 01:00:19,041
How much further?

836
01:00:20,041 --> 01:00:21,374
Ten minutes.

837
01:00:37,124 --> 01:00:38,582
Sorry.

838
01:00:48,749 --> 01:00:50,082
It must be somewhere around here?

839
01:00:50,832 --> 01:00:52,707
Which way is Bishambar Mallik Lane.

840
01:00:56,832 --> 01:00:58,999
Mrs. Bagchi, this is
Bishambar Mallik Lane.

841
01:00:59,416 --> 01:01:01,582
Didi, where is number 9.

842
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:02,832
This one. - This one?

843
01:01:02,916 --> 01:01:04,707
Yes. - This is the one. Come.

844
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:10,082
Number nine. Come on.

845
01:01:17,332 --> 01:01:18,541
You are ok to climb up?

846
01:01:18,666 --> 01:01:19,999
Yes. Let's go.

847
01:01:22,957 --> 01:01:23,999
Carefully.

848
01:01:24,749 --> 01:01:25,999
I don't know which one it is.

849
01:01:26,707 --> 01:01:28,124
There are no numbers.

850
01:01:32,499 --> 01:01:33,832
Nothing's wrong.

851
01:01:33,957 --> 01:01:35,041
Where is number three?

852
01:01:35,082 --> 01:01:37,999
Over there but it's locked. Anything
wrong sir? - Nothing, nothing.

853
01:01:38,791 --> 01:01:40,082
Come.

854
01:01:42,457 --> 01:01:43,791
Here it is.

855
01:01:43,874 --> 01:01:45,207
But it's locked.

856
01:01:46,624 --> 01:01:47,957
I see. Give.

857
01:01:51,832 --> 01:01:54,582
The police is breaking
and entering himself.

858
01:01:55,207 --> 01:01:56,541
You said so.

859
01:02:01,999 --> 01:02:03,124
Wait.

860
01:02:14,832 --> 01:02:17,916
I wonder why anyone
needed to lock this place.

861
01:02:17,999 --> 01:02:19,374
There's nothing here.

862
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:22,999
And even if there was anything then
Khan must have taken it away.

863
01:02:23,874 --> 01:02:24,999
Mrs. Bagchi.

864
01:02:25,624 --> 01:02:27,291
Mrs. Bagchi. - Yes.

865
01:02:27,457 --> 01:02:29,916
Let's go from here.
- There's nothing here.

866
01:02:30,332 --> 01:02:32,416
Yes, let me take a look.

867
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:42,332
Mrs. Bagchi, don't do that.

868
01:02:42,457 --> 01:02:45,374
No, no, I am okay. I
will surely find something.

869
01:02:48,624 --> 01:02:49,957
Let's look there.

870
01:03:00,749 --> 01:03:04,124
Did you see, Rana, only flat
no.3 didn't have a letter-box?

871
01:03:09,332 --> 01:03:10,582
Who is it?

872
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:13,207
Are there any letters for no.3?

873
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:15,041
There is one.

874
01:03:32,749 --> 01:03:34,207
There in no.9.

875
01:03:34,874 --> 01:03:37,541
Just a minute. - Poltu, come here.

876
01:03:37,624 --> 01:03:40,749
Where are you? - Rana, Milan used
to order tea from here.

877
01:03:40,832 --> 01:03:42,249
Maybe they might know something.

878
01:03:42,374 --> 01:03:43,666
But how do you know?

879
01:03:44,457 --> 01:03:48,082
You offered me tea in a
similar glass in the police station.

880
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:49,624
See what they are asking for.

881
01:03:49,707 --> 01:03:52,166
Remember, there were two similar
glasses at Milan's house. - Yes.

882
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:54,791
Now, there was no
kitchen in Milan's home, so..

883
01:03:54,999 --> 01:03:56,166
Didi Poltu.

884
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:57,874
One minute.

885
01:03:59,291 --> 01:04:01,457
Are you scared?

886
01:04:01,957 --> 01:04:03,291
He is my friend.

887
01:04:03,874 --> 01:04:05,041
What is your name?

888
01:04:05,082 --> 01:04:08,291
Poltu. - Poltu? Pet name or real name?

889
01:04:08,624 --> 01:04:11,041
Pet name. Real name is Subroto.

890
01:04:11,082 --> 01:04:13,582
Subroto, no need to be scared.

891
01:04:14,582 --> 01:04:16,124
So tell me, do you remember anything..

892
01:04:16,249 --> 01:04:17,791
...about the person in flat no.3?

893
01:04:18,166 --> 01:04:21,291
Flat no.3? No. - Anything.

894
01:04:21,999 --> 01:04:24,124
I mean what kind of
a person was he. Short-tempered?

895
01:04:24,249 --> 01:04:28,791
Or would he smile each
time you delivered tea?

896
01:04:29,124 --> 01:04:30,874
Would he say something?

897
01:04:30,999 --> 01:04:32,999
No, he wouldn't say anything, but..

898
01:04:33,832 --> 01:04:35,916
He would order only one glass of tea.

899
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:40,832
And sometimes a second
person would come to meet him.

900
01:04:40,957 --> 01:04:42,124
That's when he would order two teas.

901
01:04:42,207 --> 01:04:43,416
Yes, there was someone.

902
01:04:43,499 --> 01:04:44,999
Who was the other person?

903
01:04:45,249 --> 01:04:47,332
He would always carry a suitcase.

904
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:49,416
And the corners looked like gold.

905
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:51,082
Suitcase?

906
01:04:52,874 --> 01:04:54,124
This big.

907
01:04:54,207 --> 01:04:55,499
Briefcase.

908
01:04:56,499 --> 01:05:01,082
Oh, you look so handsome
when you smile, Subroto.

909
01:05:01,957 --> 01:05:05,499
You can win any
child's heart so easily.

910
01:05:05,999 --> 01:05:08,082
I am completely sure. - What?

911
01:05:08,916 --> 01:05:10,582
That you will be a great mother.

912
01:05:13,499 --> 01:05:16,457
What is this? Donation bills. Nonsense.

913
01:05:16,999 --> 01:05:18,957
He said there's a
letter from the bank.

914
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:20,832
But this is a blood bank.

915
01:05:21,082 --> 01:05:22,499
People's blood bank.

916
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:26,082
Bombay blood group?

917
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:30,207
Rana, Agnes had said that
Milan had a rare blood group.

918
01:05:30,582 --> 01:05:31,999
'Bombay blood group.'

919
01:05:32,582 --> 01:05:34,791
Sir, if any person
has a rare blood group..

920
01:05:34,874 --> 01:05:37,082
...then he stores his blood with us.

921
01:05:37,207 --> 01:05:38,916
So that if there's an emergency..

922
01:05:38,999 --> 01:05:40,332
...then he can use his blood.

923
01:05:40,457 --> 01:05:41,707
I see.

924
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:45,041
When was blood
required last in this case?

925
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:46,624
Will you check it and tell us?

926
01:05:47,166 --> 01:05:49,707
Just a wait a minute,
I will tell you. - Of course.

927
01:05:53,624 --> 01:05:55,582
There was a requirement
for this rare blood group..

928
01:05:55,707 --> 01:05:57,249
...on May 2008, 25th May.

929
01:05:57,374 --> 01:05:59,791
And we received a call
from Ekbalpur Nursing Home.

930
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:01,457
Ekbalpur Nursing Home?

931
01:06:07,832 --> 01:06:08,999
Not a single paper.

932
01:06:09,416 --> 01:06:10,582
No records, nothing.

933
01:06:10,957 --> 01:06:12,707
Must be. It's been erased.

934
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:14,207
Just like every
other records of Milan.

935
01:06:15,707 --> 01:06:17,916
Mrs. Bagchi, this is a dead end.

936
01:06:17,999 --> 01:06:19,416
Come on, Satyoki.

937
01:06:19,707 --> 01:06:20,916
There must be something somewhere.

938
01:06:20,999 --> 01:06:23,082
I am not going to accept defeat.
After making it so far.

939
01:06:23,916 --> 01:06:25,416
You have always helped me.

940
01:06:25,499 --> 01:06:28,249
I cannot go further
without your help, really.

941
01:06:33,082 --> 01:06:35,582
There's a man who
may be able to help us.

942
01:06:35,666 --> 01:06:37,666
He was once a police informer.

943
01:06:53,957 --> 01:06:55,207
Sorry.

944
01:06:57,874 --> 01:06:59,082
Come.

945
01:07:06,457 --> 01:07:08,124
Careful. Careful.

946
01:07:11,832 --> 01:07:12,999
Are you fine?

947
01:07:15,999 --> 01:07:17,332
Thank you.

948
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:29,957
Sir, can you tell me
where is Paresh Pal..

949
01:07:31,499 --> 01:07:32,499
Sir?

950
01:07:32,624 --> 01:07:33,874
There. There.

951
01:07:37,499 --> 01:07:38,707
Paresh.

952
01:07:41,249 --> 01:07:43,832
No. I have no
connections with the police now.

953
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:47,082
But, Paresh, we just
need a small information.

954
01:07:47,624 --> 01:07:49,916
Look, whether the
information is small or big.

955
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:51,124
I don't give it anymore.

956
01:07:51,207 --> 01:07:53,832
Paresh Please.

957
01:07:54,374 --> 01:07:55,916
Please leave.

958
01:07:55,999 --> 01:07:58,041
If someone sees us then
it will create a problem.

959
01:08:00,374 --> 01:08:01,582
Sir..

960
01:08:02,499 --> 01:08:04,249
I am searching for my husband.

961
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:08,541
I came from London in
this condition all alone.

962
01:08:08,916 --> 01:08:12,457
I just need an answer for my child..

963
01:08:12,624 --> 01:08:14,791
...that what happened to his father.

964
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:17,999
I cannot force you,

965
01:08:19,957 --> 01:08:22,541
but.. please help us.

966
01:08:25,999 --> 01:08:28,791
Tell. - Have you heard
about Milan Damji?

967
01:08:30,041 --> 01:08:31,207
Who?

968
01:08:31,291 --> 01:08:32,499
Milan Damji.

969
01:08:32,624 --> 01:08:34,707
Milan Damji. No.

970
01:08:34,832 --> 01:08:37,082
Two years ago, on 25th May..

971
01:08:37,707 --> 01:08:40,457
...Bombay blood group was
required in Ekbalpur Nursing Home.

972
01:08:40,874 --> 01:08:41,957
What for?

973
01:08:41,999 --> 01:08:43,499
We just need to find that out.

974
01:08:43,666 --> 01:08:44,916
Can you do that?

975
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:54,999
Laundry Didi?

976
01:08:59,374 --> 01:09:00,207
Laundry Didi?

977
01:09:00,332 --> 01:09:03,041
I am not Laundry Didi,
I am Bidya Didi.

978
01:09:06,499 --> 01:09:08,624
Your transistor is giving chocolate.

979
01:09:08,916 --> 01:09:11,374
Such a big chocolate. - So big.

980
01:09:12,374 --> 01:09:13,499
Hello.

981
01:09:13,624 --> 01:09:16,082
You did disturb me, I am
in a important meeting.

982
01:09:17,207 --> 01:09:18,999
In the room with Vishnu.

983
01:09:20,707 --> 01:09:21,999
Really?

984
01:09:22,499 --> 01:09:23,832
When?

985
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:32,999
25th May, 2008.

986
01:09:33,374 --> 01:09:35,582
Two men had a meeting here.

987
01:09:35,999 --> 01:09:39,416
There was news about only
two people meeting until now.

988
01:09:42,666 --> 01:09:45,957
But now it appears there was a
third person present as well.

989
01:09:46,332 --> 01:09:50,374
And the blood was ordered
from Ekbalpur Nursing Home..

990
01:09:50,457 --> 01:09:51,874
...for this third person.

991
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,999
So, was that third person Milan Damji?

992
01:09:54,082 --> 01:09:56,041
I don't have anymore information.

993
01:09:56,082 --> 01:09:57,707
Paresh..

994
01:09:57,791 --> 01:09:59,041
Wait.

995
01:09:59,207 --> 01:10:02,291
You will find the rest
of the information..

996
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:04,374
...at Park Street Police
Station or you can find Dr. Ganguly.

997
01:10:04,457 --> 01:10:07,166
That night he was on night duty.

998
01:10:13,541 --> 01:10:15,624
I remember that it was a police case..

999
01:10:15,707 --> 01:10:18,082
...but I don't remember
what exactly it was.

1000
01:10:18,666 --> 01:10:19,832
It was two years ago. - Ready, sir.

1001
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:21,124
Yes, I will be there. - Okay.

1002
01:10:21,666 --> 01:10:24,124
Give me a day, I will check
and tell you. - Thank you.

1003
01:10:24,249 --> 01:10:25,749
I need to go, I have a surgery.
- Thank you.

1004
01:10:37,916 --> 01:10:39,666
Don't worry. - Please.

1005
01:10:39,749 --> 01:10:40,999
Thank you very much.

1006
01:10:55,207 --> 01:10:56,499
Yes.

1007
01:10:56,791 --> 01:10:58,541
Dr. Ganguly? - Yes.

1008
01:10:58,749 --> 01:11:00,999
Hello. Bob Biswas.

1009
01:11:01,249 --> 01:11:03,041
Hello. - Just a minute.

1010
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:11,832
I remember that it
was a police case.'

1011
01:11:13,249 --> 01:11:14,749
Stop it Rana.

1012
01:11:14,832 --> 01:11:18,041
Your computer is driving
me up the bloody wall.

1013
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:19,416
Mr. Chatterjee.

1014
01:11:19,499 --> 01:11:20,707
What? - Hello.

1015
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:21,999
Oh my, God.

1016
01:11:22,082 --> 01:11:24,166
Bidya Bagchi.
You arrived at the right time.

1017
01:11:24,291 --> 01:11:26,999
Hi, Rana. - You had shut this computer
up the other day, didn't you?

1018
01:11:27,041 --> 01:11:29,624
Yes. - Do it today as well, please.
Otherwise I will go crazy.

1019
01:11:29,999 --> 01:11:33,082
Thank you.
- I will go meet the senior officer.

1020
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:36,082
Come, come. - Oh, God.

1021
01:11:36,374 --> 01:11:38,582
No, no, keep seated.
He can return any moment.

1022
01:11:41,999 --> 01:11:45,457
Two people were killed at Nonakpur
Tram Depot on the 25th of May.

1023
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:47,082
One was Dinesh Rao..

1024
01:11:47,207 --> 01:11:50,291
...who was a police
informer in the Metro attack case.

1025
01:11:50,416 --> 01:11:51,999
And second..

1026
01:11:53,957 --> 01:11:57,332
Second was Vijay Verma
who was a government agent.

1027
01:11:57,416 --> 01:11:58,999
Government agent?

1028
01:12:02,082 --> 01:12:03,916
He's back, he's back.

1029
01:12:06,374 --> 01:12:07,416
It's done, sir.

1030
01:12:07,499 --> 01:12:09,041
Done, Mr. Chatterjee.

1031
01:12:09,082 --> 01:12:09,999
It's done.

1032
01:12:10,124 --> 01:12:11,832
That's nice, very good.

1033
01:12:11,916 --> 01:12:13,041
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.

1034
01:12:13,082 --> 01:12:15,082
Welcome. - Okay.

1035
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:17,916
What is the matter?

1036
01:12:18,041 --> 01:12:20,707
Mr. Chatterjee, may I leave?

1037
01:12:20,957 --> 01:12:22,041
Yes.

1038
01:12:22,166 --> 01:12:24,082
Bye. - Bye.

1039
01:13:01,916 --> 01:13:03,124
Yes, mother.

1040
01:13:03,791 --> 01:13:05,082
I am coming.

1041
01:13:33,957 --> 01:13:35,291
Mrs. Bagchi, what are you doing?

1042
01:13:35,416 --> 01:13:36,624
Why are you cleaning it yourself?

1043
01:13:36,749 --> 01:13:37,874
Wait, I will call the staff?

1044
01:13:37,957 --> 01:13:39,041
No. no, no, no. - Come here.

1045
01:13:39,124 --> 01:13:40,916
I do the cleaning myself at home.

1046
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:43,749
Sit. I cannot tolerate dust.

1047
01:13:43,916 --> 01:13:45,124
Pull a chair.

1048
01:13:45,207 --> 01:13:46,916
Speak, Satyoki Sinha.

1049
01:13:48,041 --> 01:13:49,541
Mrs. Bagchi, I
pursued the information..

1050
01:13:49,666 --> 01:13:51,041
...acquired from the database.

1051
01:13:51,082 --> 01:13:53,416
There is no mention of a
third person in the records.

1052
01:13:53,541 --> 01:13:56,791
Dr. Ganguly, Milan Damiyji,
Ekbalpur Nursing Home.

1053
01:13:56,874 --> 01:13:58,916
No one knows anything about them.

1054
01:13:58,999 --> 01:14:01,666
There are only
records of Vijay and Dinesh.

1055
01:14:02,166 --> 01:14:03,916
Vijay Verma was
investigating the Metro attack..

1056
01:14:03,999 --> 01:14:05,707
...at ground level.

1057
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:11,041
Really? - That's why he met Dinesh
Raut at Nonakpur Tram Depot.

1058
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:14,916
Maybe Dinesh wanted to tell Vijay..

1059
01:14:14,999 --> 01:14:17,082
...something about Milan.

1060
01:14:17,832 --> 01:14:20,791
And someone informed Milan about it.

1061
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:25,499
Milan killed both of them and
got injured in the shootout.

1062
01:14:26,541 --> 01:14:29,041
But the question is
that how did Milan know..

1063
01:14:29,082 --> 01:14:31,666
...that Vijay is going to
receive information about him?

1064
01:14:31,999 --> 01:14:33,416
Maybe Khan was right.

1065
01:14:34,082 --> 01:14:35,957
There is someone within the system..

1066
01:14:36,041 --> 01:14:37,249
...who is helping Milan.

1067
01:14:37,332 --> 01:14:38,541
One more thing.

1068
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:41,041
NDC is also involved in this.
- Really?

1069
01:14:41,082 --> 01:14:44,082
Mrs. Bagchi, every agent
has a local, a fake identity.

1070
01:14:44,207 --> 01:14:45,541
Just like Milan Damji..

1071
01:14:45,707 --> 01:14:47,999
...even Vijay Verma worked for NDC.

1072
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:49,916
To hide his true identity.

1073
01:14:54,874 --> 01:14:56,666
It must be him, take a good look.

1074
01:14:57,666 --> 01:14:59,791
No. it wasn't him.

1075
01:14:59,916 --> 01:15:01,499
Now, now, take a look.

1076
01:15:01,666 --> 01:15:03,416
No, Didi. That wasn't him.

1077
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:05,749
It's not him. - Are you sure?

1078
01:15:05,832 --> 01:15:06,999
Sure.

1079
01:15:07,916 --> 01:15:09,291
Come, let's take Poltu back.

1080
01:15:09,374 --> 01:15:11,707
I was absolutely sure that..

1081
01:15:11,832 --> 01:15:14,957
Tyagi knew that Agnes is
looking for Milan's details.

1082
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:16,624
And Tyagi stopped you. - Of course.

1083
01:15:16,749 --> 01:15:18,124
Didi. - What?

1084
01:15:18,207 --> 01:15:19,541
The suitcase.

1085
01:15:26,624 --> 01:15:27,832
It was him, Didi.

1086
01:15:29,874 --> 01:15:31,416
Are you sure? - Sure, it was him.

1087
01:15:33,374 --> 01:15:34,457
Who was he?

1088
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:35,374
I don't know.

1089
01:15:35,499 --> 01:15:38,041
You take Poltu home..

1090
01:15:38,082 --> 01:15:40,041
...I will find out
and meet you there. - Yes.

1091
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:42,291
Good morning, sir.

1092
01:15:43,249 --> 01:15:44,666
Good morning, sir.

1093
01:15:46,124 --> 01:15:47,249
Good morning.

1094
01:16:16,082 --> 01:16:18,332
Turn around. Turn around.

1095
01:16:38,707 --> 01:16:39,666
Didi? - Yes.

1096
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:42,082
Will you have tea? - No.

1097
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:46,041
Listen, when Rana arrives
will you ask him to call me.

1098
01:16:46,124 --> 01:16:47,416
The police officer? - Yes.

1099
01:16:47,499 --> 01:16:48,832
Okay. Yes, fine.

1100
01:16:49,124 --> 01:16:50,374
Bye.

1101
01:17:21,999 --> 01:17:23,832
Sorry. - Rana.

1102
01:17:23,916 --> 01:17:26,041
I was waiting for you at
the tea-stall for so long..

1103
01:17:26,082 --> 01:17:28,374
Blood! - Oh no.

1104
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:37,082
Rana, that's him. He tried to kill me.

1105
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:39,041
Stop. Stop.

1106
01:18:03,082 --> 01:18:04,541
Stop.

1107
01:18:06,207 --> 01:18:07,541
Move.

1108
01:18:32,957 --> 01:18:34,957
Stop. I am the police.

1109
01:18:55,874 --> 01:18:57,832
Stop. - Stop.

1110
01:18:58,291 --> 01:18:59,624
Stop.

1111
01:19:17,832 --> 01:19:19,124
Oh, God.

1112
01:19:19,207 --> 01:19:21,957
Mrs. Bagchi, Bob Biswas
was a contract killer.

1113
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:22,916
This is his phone.

1114
01:19:22,999 --> 01:19:25,041
And I have found these
photographs in his phone.

1115
01:19:25,749 --> 01:19:26,957
Agnes D'mello.

1116
01:19:27,791 --> 01:19:29,041
Dr. Ganguly.

1117
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:31,207
And you.

1118
01:19:31,291 --> 01:19:32,249
This time you survived.

1119
01:19:32,374 --> 01:19:34,207
But the man who hired Bob..

1120
01:19:34,332 --> 01:19:36,166
..who doesn't want
anyone to reach Milan Damji..

1121
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:38,374
I gave this photo to Agnes.

1122
01:19:38,957 --> 01:19:40,041
Just a minute.

1123
01:19:46,041 --> 01:19:47,249
Look.

1124
01:19:47,874 --> 01:19:50,166
I gave a copy of this photo to Agnes.

1125
01:19:50,874 --> 01:19:53,416
That means whoever gave
Bob the contract is in NDC.

1126
01:19:53,499 --> 01:19:57,624
No, no. It means you didn't
hear anything I said until now.

1127
01:19:57,791 --> 01:19:59,416
And you don't understand, Mrs. Bagchi.

1128
01:19:59,499 --> 01:20:00,791
Your life is in danger.

1129
01:20:00,874 --> 01:20:02,041
And I will have to
tell Mr. Khan about this.

1130
01:20:02,082 --> 01:20:03,207
Did you find out who Mr.
Briefcase was?

1131
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:04,707
Mrs. Bagchi. - Who was he?

1132
01:20:05,707 --> 01:20:06,832
He is Shridhar.

1133
01:20:06,999 --> 01:20:08,124
The head of IT department.

1134
01:20:08,207 --> 01:20:09,666
Tyagi reports to him.

1135
01:20:14,999 --> 01:20:18,082
Rana, we thought that
Tyagi is doing everything.

1136
01:20:18,582 --> 01:20:21,207
But Tyagi was only
passing the information.

1137
01:20:21,291 --> 01:20:23,332
We have no such evidence.

1138
01:20:23,957 --> 01:20:25,041
Come, let's go to the police.

1139
01:20:25,124 --> 01:20:26,832
And yes, that phone is a evidence.

1140
01:20:26,957 --> 01:20:27,957
Please give it back.

1141
01:20:27,999 --> 01:20:28,999
Phone.

1142
01:20:29,957 --> 01:20:31,791
Rana look.

1143
01:20:31,874 --> 01:20:34,207
Bob has been sent this
message from some website.

1144
01:20:34,582 --> 01:20:35,707
So?

1145
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:39,041
Once I hack this
website then I will know..

1146
01:20:39,082 --> 01:20:40,416
...whose computer these
photos were sent from.

1147
01:20:40,541 --> 01:20:41,457
What, you...?

1148
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:46,707
You are a hacker?

1149
01:20:46,791 --> 01:20:48,082
Only in my spare time.

1150
01:20:48,791 --> 01:20:50,957
You do know that I am
the police, don't you?

1151
01:20:57,666 --> 01:20:59,332
Yes, yes, yes.

1152
01:21:00,457 --> 01:21:01,499
Sorry.

1153
01:21:03,582 --> 01:21:05,707
This is the IP
address of the computer..

1154
01:21:05,832 --> 01:21:07,791
...from where the
photos the photos were sent.

1155
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:09,749
And I am completely sure..

1156
01:21:09,832 --> 01:21:11,416
...this is the IP address
of that Mr. Briefcase.

1157
01:21:11,541 --> 01:21:12,874
And once that is confirmed..

1158
01:21:12,957 --> 01:21:14,291
...then we can find Milan Damji.

1159
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:15,791
No, no, no. Mrs. Bagchi. Mrs. Bagchi.

1160
01:21:15,874 --> 01:21:17,416
This matter is very serious now.

1161
01:21:17,541 --> 01:21:19,291
And I still say that we
should go to the police.

1162
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,041
We don't have time, Rana.

1163
01:21:21,541 --> 01:21:24,499
Mr. Briefcase will soon
find out that Bob is dead..

1164
01:21:24,624 --> 01:21:26,416
...and then he will try
to erase all the records.

1165
01:21:26,541 --> 01:21:27,457
No, Mrs. Bagchi, I..

1166
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:30,332
Please. We just have to
access Shridhar's computer.

1167
01:21:30,457 --> 01:21:32,457
After that we will go to the police.

1168
01:21:32,791 --> 01:21:34,791
Cross my heart and hope to die.

1169
01:21:37,707 --> 01:21:39,332
You think death is a joke, Vidya?

1170
01:21:42,041 --> 01:21:44,582
Mrs. Bagchi, I have
told you so many times..

1171
01:21:44,999 --> 01:21:46,791
...that your life is in danger.

1172
01:21:48,457 --> 01:21:50,832
You even witnessed
everything with your own eyes.

1173
01:21:51,374 --> 01:21:53,916
Even after that you
are joking about death.

1174
01:21:57,749 --> 01:22:00,332
Maybe because, after Arnab..

1175
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:03,999
...life has become a joke, Rana.

1176
01:22:05,999 --> 01:22:07,124
Shall we?

1177
01:22:21,124 --> 01:22:22,207
Sapna.

1178
01:22:22,666 --> 01:22:23,666
Yes, sir.

1179
01:22:23,749 --> 01:22:25,374
You haven't left yet, Sapna.

1180
01:22:25,624 --> 01:22:27,999
Sir, the office is going to
shout for the Puja from tomorrow.

1181
01:22:28,124 --> 01:22:29,916
So I was completing my work.

1182
01:22:31,707 --> 01:22:34,666
It is very good to see
someone working so hard.

1183
01:22:35,332 --> 01:22:40,041
One day, when I get the
time I will take you out.

1184
01:22:40,374 --> 01:22:41,499
For coffee.

1185
01:22:41,582 --> 01:22:42,999
I would love that, sir.

1186
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,249
Bye.

1187
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:47,832
Good evening sir.

1188
01:22:50,916 --> 01:22:52,499
I am coming, darling.

1189
01:22:55,416 --> 01:22:57,124
Good evening, sir. - Good evening.

1190
01:22:57,916 --> 01:22:59,416
This is the visitor's entry book

1191
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:01,874
Get the employer's book. - Sorry, sir.

1192
01:23:07,874 --> 01:23:08,957
Thank you.

1193
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:10,207
Come.

1194
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:25,541
It's not opening.

1195
01:23:33,582 --> 01:23:35,041
Thank you. - Rana please hurry.

1196
01:23:35,082 --> 01:23:36,124
Thanks.

1197
01:23:38,957 --> 01:23:41,041
Mrs. Bagchi, quickly do
whatever you want to do.

1198
01:24:17,082 --> 01:24:18,832
Bob.. Come on Bob,
pick up the phone.

1199
01:24:18,916 --> 01:24:19,999
Bob Bob.

1200
01:24:22,749 --> 01:24:23,874
Mrs. Bagchi, hurry up please.

1201
01:24:23,957 --> 01:24:25,041
Rana, just a minute.

1202
01:24:25,124 --> 01:24:26,416
I am almost there.

1203
01:24:38,707 --> 01:24:41,041
Mrs. Bagchi, what is happening?

1204
01:24:42,457 --> 01:24:44,874
Sapna was right, there are
many layers of protection.

1205
01:24:44,999 --> 01:24:46,166
It will take a little time.

1206
01:24:51,124 --> 01:24:55,416
Mrs. Bagchi, why is it taking
you so long to check an IP address?

1207
01:24:57,124 --> 01:24:59,374
Rana. Rana. IP address.

1208
01:24:59,499 --> 01:25:00,707
It's the same IP address.

1209
01:25:00,791 --> 01:25:02,999
Mr. Briefcase. We've nailed him.
- Are you sure?

1210
01:25:03,332 --> 01:25:04,999
Of course.

1211
01:25:05,666 --> 01:25:06,999
Guard! Guard!

1212
01:25:07,041 --> 01:25:08,374
Why are you sleeping? Get up.

1213
01:25:08,457 --> 01:25:10,249
Yes. - Was someone here
with Sapna madam?

1214
01:25:10,332 --> 01:25:12,874
A man and a woman.

1215
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:15,249
Oh no. Close all doors.

1216
01:25:15,374 --> 01:25:16,791
Don't let anyone go out.

1217
01:25:16,916 --> 01:25:17,874
Yes, sir.

1218
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:31,082
Did anyone come down?

1219
01:25:31,166 --> 01:25:32,249
No, sir.

1220
01:25:34,957 --> 01:25:36,832
Where did they go? Where can they..

1221
01:25:37,541 --> 01:25:38,499
Hey

1222
01:25:38,582 --> 01:25:41,874
The back entrance, where
people go to smoke is it open?

1223
01:25:41,957 --> 01:25:43,166
Yes, sir.

1224
01:25:48,499 --> 01:25:49,582
Come.

1225
01:25:49,707 --> 01:25:51,041
We came out at the right time.

1226
01:26:30,374 --> 01:26:31,749
Oh no.

1227
01:26:31,874 --> 01:26:34,249
Mrs. Bagchi, come quickly.

1228
01:26:38,832 --> 01:26:39,832
Hello.

1229
01:26:39,957 --> 01:26:41,374
Sir we came out from the back entrance..
Shridhar is following us.

1230
01:26:41,499 --> 01:26:43,207
What happened? Who are you calling?

1231
01:26:43,291 --> 01:26:44,624
Yes.

1232
01:26:44,707 --> 01:26:46,416
Please come quickly, sir.
We need help.

1233
01:26:46,499 --> 01:26:47,832
What happened?

1234
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:49,166
I had to call Khan sir.

1235
01:26:49,249 --> 01:26:50,249
Khan?

1236
01:26:50,374 --> 01:26:52,999
Sorry. Shridhar is right behind us.
Maybe he knows.

1237
01:27:01,624 --> 01:27:02,957
Come.

1238
01:27:05,707 --> 01:27:07,791
What did you take from my computer?

1239
01:27:19,207 --> 01:27:20,416
Gun.

1240
01:27:20,541 --> 01:27:22,249
Where is my gun?

1241
01:27:33,249 --> 01:27:35,082
Come. Let's go, Mrs. Bagchi.

1242
01:27:35,749 --> 01:27:37,166
Rana, bag.

1243
01:27:39,624 --> 01:27:41,874
Stop it. - Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

1244
01:27:41,957 --> 01:27:43,749
We want this man alive.

1245
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:54,499
No, no, no. this man can't die.

1246
01:27:55,707 --> 01:27:58,374
Oh no. We wanted this man alive.

1247
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:00,749
Why didn't you call me earlier?

1248
01:28:00,957 --> 01:28:02,666
How will we catch Milan now?

1249
01:28:07,624 --> 01:28:09,832
How will we catch Milan without him?

1250
01:28:12,166 --> 01:28:13,374
Take him to the hospital.

1251
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:17,124
Rana works for me.

1252
01:28:20,041 --> 01:28:22,166
Mrs. Bagchi, do you
remember what I said.

1253
01:28:22,874 --> 01:28:25,166
We've been looking for
Milan for the past two years.

1254
01:28:26,499 --> 01:28:29,582
And we had this last
option to find him.

1255
01:28:30,832 --> 01:28:33,749
You. You could do what we couldn't.

1256
01:28:33,874 --> 01:28:36,166
But you ruined the entire plan.

1257
01:28:38,041 --> 01:28:41,499
Actually, Mrs. Bagchi, there's
someone in the organization..

1258
01:28:41,624 --> 01:28:43,874
...who is helping Milan.

1259
01:28:44,707 --> 01:28:47,541
Mr. Khan couldn't
reopen the case himself.

1260
01:28:48,666 --> 01:28:50,957
So he asked for my help.

1261
01:28:51,541 --> 01:28:54,916
...so that we can
find Milan through you.

1262
01:28:54,999 --> 01:28:56,041
'Do you love your job?"

1263
01:28:56,166 --> 01:28:57,249
'Yes, sir.'

1264
01:28:57,374 --> 01:28:58,874
'From today you will work for me.'

1265
01:29:02,666 --> 01:29:03,999
Why me?

1266
01:29:04,041 --> 01:29:06,541
Because no one's
scared of a pregnant woman.

1267
01:29:06,666 --> 01:29:08,332
Especially one whose
husband has run away.

1268
01:29:08,541 --> 01:29:09,999
No one would've doubted.

1269
01:29:10,582 --> 01:29:14,291
But, Mrs. Bagchi,
only because of you..

1270
01:29:15,041 --> 01:29:19,041
...we could find out that Milan is
responsible for Vijay's death too.

1271
01:29:19,124 --> 01:29:23,582
And we could reach Shridhar
only because of you, Mrs. Bagchi.

1272
01:29:24,332 --> 01:29:28,166
You were using me.

1273
01:29:28,249 --> 01:29:29,499
Yes.

1274
01:29:31,957 --> 01:29:34,874
Your case was revived
only because of me..

1275
01:29:36,582 --> 01:29:38,582
...because Arnab looks just like Milan.

1276
01:29:38,749 --> 01:29:39,832
But we don't have time for..

1277
01:29:39,957 --> 01:29:41,082
And Agnes?

1278
01:29:41,791 --> 01:29:43,874
Dr. Ganguly? - Collateral damage.

1279
01:29:44,332 --> 01:29:45,957
One needs to make small
sacrifices in big battles..

1280
01:29:46,041 --> 01:29:47,124
...what's the big deal?

1281
01:29:47,207 --> 01:29:49,207
And me? My child?

1282
01:29:49,582 --> 01:29:52,166
Nothing would've happened to you.

1283
01:29:52,832 --> 01:29:54,249
I wouldn't have allowed it.

1284
01:29:54,332 --> 01:29:56,916
I took up this
assignment only because of you.

1285
01:30:03,957 --> 01:30:06,707
Mrs. Bagchi, we wanted Shridhar alive.

1286
01:30:06,832 --> 01:30:08,332
He was the only one
who could've lead us..

1287
01:30:08,416 --> 01:30:10,874
...to the man who is helping
Milan from within the system.

1288
01:30:11,207 --> 01:30:12,541
Listen to me carefully.

1289
01:30:12,666 --> 01:30:14,082
We have one last option.

1290
01:30:14,374 --> 01:30:16,374
You have hacked Shridhar's computer.

1291
01:30:16,874 --> 01:30:19,499
Do it again. We might find a clue.

1292
01:30:19,832 --> 01:30:21,499
Why should I help you?

1293
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:24,957
I am not asking for
your help, Mrs. Bagchi.

1294
01:30:24,999 --> 01:30:26,082
I am telling you.

1295
01:30:26,166 --> 01:30:28,582
Mrs. Bagchi. Mrs. Bagchi.

1296
01:32:28,999 --> 01:32:30,541
Bishnu!

1297
01:33:36,791 --> 01:33:38,041
Mr. Khan.

1298
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:47,124
This is the only code
that I don't understand.

1299
01:33:47,791 --> 01:33:49,041
Rest of the computer is clean.

1300
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:51,666
CXWWEDFXZS.

1301
01:33:51,749 --> 01:33:52,874
Is that all you found?

1302
01:34:18,291 --> 01:34:20,874
Rana. Any idea?

1303
01:34:21,957 --> 01:34:23,999
No. |I don't know.

1304
01:34:26,249 --> 01:34:27,791
What can it be?

1305
01:34:33,832 --> 01:34:35,041
Give me your phone, sir.

1306
01:34:35,124 --> 01:34:41,957
CXWWEDFXZS.

1307
01:34:44,124 --> 01:34:46,957
Sir, I feel this is a mobile number.

1308
01:34:50,666 --> 01:34:52,207
This is Bhaskaran's number.

1309
01:34:54,207 --> 01:34:56,332
What the..

1310
01:34:57,582 --> 01:35:00,374
Mrs. Bagchi. You will have
to do one last thing for me.

1311
01:35:00,707 --> 01:35:02,041
Mrs. Bagchi.

1312
01:35:04,332 --> 01:35:05,666
Are you listening?

1313
01:35:05,999 --> 01:35:07,124
Mrs. Bagchi.

1314
01:35:11,041 --> 01:35:12,249
Call Bhaskaran.

1315
01:35:12,916 --> 01:35:14,207
And lie to him that..

1316
01:35:14,291 --> 01:35:16,541
...you found some data about
him on Shridhar's computer?

1317
01:35:17,207 --> 01:35:18,582
Why should I do that?

1318
01:35:18,749 --> 01:35:20,957
Because Bhaskaran
is our last chance..

1319
01:35:21,124 --> 01:35:23,082
...to find Arnab and Milan.

1320
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:32,541
Mrs. Bagchi.

1321
01:35:34,499 --> 01:35:37,416
I have always been rude with you..

1322
01:35:38,499 --> 01:35:42,332
This time it's a request, so..

1323
01:35:47,041 --> 01:35:48,416
Please help me.

1324
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:55,291
Mr. Bhaskaran.

1325
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:56,541
Yes.

1326
01:35:56,666 --> 01:35:57,582
Who is this?

1327
01:35:57,707 --> 01:35:59,416
This is Vidya Bagchi speaking.

1328
01:35:59,707 --> 01:36:01,041
Where did you get my number from?

1329
01:36:01,124 --> 01:36:03,041
From Shriddhar's computer.

1330
01:36:03,624 --> 01:36:06,457
I have found some more papers
in your name. - So?

1331
01:36:06,582 --> 01:36:11,041
Look, I don't care about
who you are or what you do.

1332
01:36:11,124 --> 01:36:13,082
I will return all your papers..

1333
01:36:13,166 --> 01:36:17,999
...in return I want the government
to help me find my husband.

1334
01:36:18,041 --> 01:36:20,916
Look, I don't know
why you are calling me.

1335
01:36:20,999 --> 01:36:22,666
I will inform my local office.

1336
01:36:22,791 --> 01:36:25,166
They will contact you.

1337
01:36:35,666 --> 01:36:36,874
Now?

1338
01:36:45,124 --> 01:36:46,541
If you want to see
your husband alive..

1339
01:36:46,666 --> 01:36:47,999
...then wait for my call.

1340
01:36:53,707 --> 01:36:54,999
Milan Damji.

1341
01:36:59,041 --> 01:37:02,166
Yes, I need a big brown envelope.

1342
01:37:03,624 --> 01:37:05,041
Okay.

1343
01:37:13,416 --> 01:37:14,624
Hello.

1344
01:37:28,499 --> 01:37:29,832
How are you?

1345
01:37:30,499 --> 01:37:31,707
Fine.

1346
01:37:35,582 --> 01:37:37,166
I had to make a promise.

1347
01:37:38,166 --> 01:37:39,582
But before that..

1348
01:37:42,832 --> 01:37:44,082
...this is for you.

1349
01:37:44,666 --> 01:37:46,666
Today's the last day of the Puja.

1350
01:37:54,499 --> 01:37:55,457
I cannot take this.

1351
01:37:55,541 --> 01:37:56,999
No, no, no, Mrs. Bagchi, this..

1352
01:37:57,749 --> 01:38:00,874
I still have the receipt.

1353
01:38:00,999 --> 01:38:02,957
I wanted to promise you that..

1354
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:06,874
...I will help you in finding Arnab.

1355
01:38:07,791 --> 01:38:11,416
And when we find him, I will
make him pay for this sari.

1356
01:38:14,207 --> 01:38:17,166
This is from Arnab, not me.

1357
01:38:20,832 --> 01:38:22,291
I am sorry, Mrs. Bagchi.

1358
01:38:23,041 --> 01:38:24,249
I am really very sorry.

1359
01:38:34,791 --> 01:38:36,041
Thank you.

1360
01:38:39,249 --> 01:38:40,541
Sorry.

1361
01:38:44,832 --> 01:38:46,166
Paresh Pal.

1362
01:38:46,999 --> 01:38:47,957
Yes, Paresh.

1363
01:38:48,041 --> 01:38:50,166
You were asking about
Milan Damji, weren't you?

1364
01:38:50,249 --> 01:38:51,707
Yes, did you find out anything?

1365
01:38:51,832 --> 01:38:54,082
The news is that he
has returned to Kolkata.

1366
01:38:54,374 --> 01:38:57,207
Wow. Then Khan
sir's plan is working.

1367
01:38:57,499 --> 01:39:00,041
Only Milan can come see Vidya.

1368
01:39:00,124 --> 01:39:02,999
Bhaskaran doesn't have
any other option. - Vidya?

1369
01:39:03,457 --> 01:39:04,416
Yes.

1370
01:39:04,499 --> 01:39:06,582
As soon as Milan comes to
see her, he will be caught.

1371
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:09,874
You want to sacrifice a helpless girl?

1372
01:39:09,957 --> 01:39:11,916
No, no, no, this isn't my plan.

1373
01:39:11,999 --> 01:39:13,207
This is Khan sir's plan.

1374
01:39:13,457 --> 01:39:15,207
And Mrs. Bagchi..

1375
01:39:18,041 --> 01:39:19,957
Move. - Call him up.

1376
01:39:20,041 --> 01:39:21,582
Sir, sir. Sir, I am sorry.

1377
01:39:21,707 --> 01:39:22,666
Just a minute.

1378
01:39:22,791 --> 01:39:24,957
We will have to stop this operation
at any cost, sir. - Yes.

1379
01:39:24,999 --> 01:39:27,916
If Milan meets Mrs. Bagchi,
then her life is in danger.

1380
01:39:27,999 --> 01:39:29,582
So? - You don't understand, sir.

1381
01:39:29,749 --> 01:39:31,291
Milan never leaves
behind any eye-witness.

1382
01:39:31,374 --> 01:39:32,999
He will do the same
this time as well.

1383
01:39:33,541 --> 01:39:36,332
So, we will try to
save your Mrs. Bagchi.

1384
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:39,541
You know, sir.

1385
01:39:39,749 --> 01:39:41,041
You know, yet you are..

1386
01:39:41,082 --> 01:39:42,374
Sacrificing her.

1387
01:39:42,707 --> 01:39:43,999
This is wrong.

1388
01:39:44,124 --> 01:39:45,541
You are intentionally. - Shut up.

1389
01:39:45,666 --> 01:39:47,416
You want to teach
me right and wrong.

1390
01:39:47,541 --> 01:39:49,082
My job is to protect the country..

1391
01:39:49,166 --> 01:39:51,332
...and anything I do for that is right.

1392
01:39:51,874 --> 01:39:55,582
If I have to sacrifice Vidya
Bagchi to catch Milan Damji..

1393
01:39:55,666 --> 01:39:56,541
...then that's right too.

1394
01:39:56,666 --> 01:39:58,749
Then what is the difference
between us and Milan, sir?

1395
01:39:58,874 --> 01:40:00,041
There's no difference.

1396
01:40:01,166 --> 01:40:03,541
We do it for the law and
he does it against the law.

1397
01:40:03,832 --> 01:40:05,874
That's why we are
right and he's wrong.

1398
01:40:08,582 --> 01:40:09,999
Love is a good thing, Rana.

1399
01:40:10,041 --> 01:40:11,916
But learn to use it
at the right place.

1400
01:40:12,457 --> 01:40:13,499
Meaning?

1401
01:40:13,624 --> 01:40:18,416
Your love that's telling you Go
tell Vidya Bagchi about Khan.

1402
01:40:18,499 --> 01:40:19,957
That's wrong.

1403
01:40:20,332 --> 01:40:21,957
This way you can save only one life..

1404
01:40:21,999 --> 01:40:25,082
...but what about thousands of
lives that Milan will take?

1405
01:40:25,916 --> 01:40:27,707
I wasn't going to tell her, sir, but..

1406
01:40:27,832 --> 01:40:29,541
Rajveer, take his mobile.

1407
01:40:29,832 --> 01:40:31,082
Don't let him go anywhere.

1408
01:40:31,166 --> 01:40:32,582
Not even to the bathroom.

1409
01:40:35,416 --> 01:40:37,166
No, sir. Nothing important.

1410
01:40:37,707 --> 01:40:39,457
Yes, so what were you saying?

1411
01:41:41,582 --> 01:41:43,124
Bidya didi.

1412
01:41:43,791 --> 01:41:45,041
Bidya didi.

1413
01:42:02,999 --> 01:42:04,207
Didi.

1414
01:42:26,041 --> 01:42:27,916
You are Sharma, aren't you?
- Yes, why?

1415
01:42:27,999 --> 01:42:29,749
Khan sir is calling you.
- Where?

1416
01:42:29,999 --> 01:42:32,416
In the AC.. OC chamber.

1417
01:42:32,707 --> 01:42:33,916
You go.

1418
01:42:33,999 --> 01:42:36,457
And he has asked me to sit here.

1419
01:42:36,916 --> 01:42:38,082
I will keep a watch on him.

1420
01:42:43,791 --> 01:42:45,374
Rana. Go.

1421
01:42:45,999 --> 01:42:47,041
Go, go.

1422
01:42:47,124 --> 01:42:49,374
What about you?
- I will handle it here. Go.

1423
01:42:49,457 --> 01:42:50,749
Thank you, Chatterjee.

1424
01:42:54,124 --> 01:42:55,332
Rana. - Yes.

1425
01:42:55,457 --> 01:42:57,207
Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

1426
01:43:08,249 --> 01:43:09,499
Hello.

1427
01:43:13,666 --> 01:43:14,999
Triangular Park.

1428
01:43:18,374 --> 01:43:19,332
Hello.

1429
01:43:19,749 --> 01:43:21,207
Triangular Park. Triangular Park.

1430
01:43:21,291 --> 01:43:22,457
Get lost.

1431
01:43:23,249 --> 01:43:24,249
Sir, where is Rana?

1432
01:43:24,374 --> 01:43:25,707
To hell with him. Come on.

1433
01:43:26,749 --> 01:43:27,999
Rajveer, follow us.

1434
01:43:28,041 --> 01:43:29,041
Come on, hurry up.

1435
01:43:29,082 --> 01:43:30,374
Come on, come on, hurry up.

1436
01:43:36,541 --> 01:43:37,582
Where is Mrs. Bagchi?

1437
01:43:37,707 --> 01:43:38,916
She paid her dues and left.

1438
01:43:38,999 --> 01:43:41,166
Where did she go?
- Didi went to Triangular Park.

1439
01:45:06,957 --> 01:45:08,332
Mrs. Bagchi.

1440
01:46:15,541 --> 01:46:17,624
Take a left from here, Mrs. Bagchi.

1441
01:46:44,457 --> 01:46:45,749
Mrs. Bagchi.

1442
01:46:47,957 --> 01:46:49,166
Where are the files?

1443
01:46:49,582 --> 01:46:50,916
Who are you?

1444
01:46:51,749 --> 01:46:53,041
What difference does it make?

1445
01:46:54,124 --> 01:46:55,291
Files.

1446
01:46:56,582 --> 01:46:57,957
Milan Damji..

1447
01:47:00,249 --> 01:47:01,457
...who was just a story until now.

1448
01:47:01,582 --> 01:47:03,207
I have very little time, Mrs. Bagchi.

1449
01:47:04,041 --> 01:47:07,374
If you want your husband back Files.

1450
01:47:08,499 --> 01:47:10,082
If I return the papers then..

1451
01:47:10,541 --> 01:47:12,041
...will you return me my husband?

1452
01:47:12,082 --> 01:47:13,749
Yes. Files.

1453
01:47:18,624 --> 01:47:20,041
Can you return him?

1454
01:47:21,499 --> 01:47:23,041
Think about it.

1455
01:49:39,541 --> 01:49:40,999
Who are you?

1456
01:49:41,957 --> 01:49:43,249
What difference does it make?

1457
01:49:56,832 --> 01:49:59,457
Mrs. Bagchi. Mrs. Bagchi.

1458
01:50:10,041 --> 01:50:11,332
Catch her.

1459
01:50:11,791 --> 01:50:13,207
Check him. Check him.

1460
01:50:14,624 --> 01:50:16,457
Catch her. She's
wearing a white sari.

1461
01:50:18,082 --> 01:50:19,332
I said she's wearing a white sari.

1462
01:50:19,457 --> 01:50:20,707
Are you blind?

1463
01:51:20,041 --> 01:51:21,541
Who was Mrs. Bagchi?

1464
01:51:21,666 --> 01:51:23,749
Vidya Bagchi was a story, sir?

1465
01:51:23,832 --> 01:51:25,082
Meaning?

1466
01:51:26,791 --> 01:51:28,999
Where is Mrs. Bagchi?
- 'Didi went to Triangular Park.'

1467
01:51:29,041 --> 01:51:30,291
'Triangular Park.'

1468
01:51:37,041 --> 01:51:38,999
'This is a flying swan.'

1469
01:51:40,957 --> 01:51:42,041
<i>"Where did you find this uniform?"</i>

1470
01:51:42,124 --> 01:51:44,541
'This? It's my school uniform.'

1471
01:51:44,791 --> 01:51:46,874
"Back when I lived in Thakurpukur.'

1472
01:51:46,999 --> 01:51:49,332
'Any uncle. Anyone.'

1473
01:51:50,124 --> 01:51:52,582
'He has an uncle, who
lives in Thakurpukur.'

1474
01:51:52,707 --> 01:51:53,999
"Did you ever tell
Didi Vidya about this?"

1475
01:51:54,124 --> 01:51:56,207
'Yes, when we met for the first time.'

1476
01:51:56,332 --> 01:51:58,957
'I have heard many stories about it.'

1477
01:52:03,582 --> 01:52:05,666
Check her hotel room
and her finger prints.

1478
01:52:05,749 --> 01:52:06,999
It's of no use, sir.

1479
01:52:07,041 --> 01:52:08,499
'Why are you cleaning it yourself?'

1480
01:52:10,541 --> 01:52:13,291
What? - 'Just one sign
and then you can leave.'

1481
01:52:13,499 --> 01:52:14,916
'Sign here.'

1482
01:52:14,999 --> 01:52:15,999
'Here.'

1483
01:52:16,041 --> 01:52:18,082
And her husband, Arnab?

1484
01:52:18,166 --> 01:52:20,207
Oh, so you haven't
understood yet, sir.

1485
01:52:20,874 --> 01:52:23,207
What? - 'In the beginning,
you told her a story.'

1486
01:52:23,291 --> 01:52:25,082
'There is no one called Milan.'

1487
01:52:25,166 --> 01:52:26,124
Yes, so?

1488
01:52:26,207 --> 01:52:27,999
And she told us a story.

1489
01:52:28,041 --> 01:52:29,124
'My husband is missing.'

1490
01:52:29,207 --> 01:52:30,999
'Arnab Bagchi didn't stay here.'

1491
01:52:31,041 --> 01:52:31,957
'No, dear.'

1492
01:52:31,999 --> 01:52:33,874
'He didn't leave
London or land in Kolkata.'

1493
01:52:33,957 --> 01:52:35,166
Milan was for real, sir.

1494
01:52:35,249 --> 01:52:38,749
But there is no
Vidya Bagchi nor Arnab..

1495
01:52:38,832 --> 01:52:41,249
...who looks like Milan. - 'Arnab didn't
like to get his picture taken.'

1496
01:52:41,374 --> 01:52:43,082
'Until Agnes didn't see
Arnab's photo properly.'

1497
01:52:43,166 --> 01:52:46,749
'And the day we find Milan,
we will find Arnab.'

1498
01:52:47,124 --> 01:52:49,041
What the..

1499
01:52:50,666 --> 01:52:52,749
That means until now.. - Correct.

1500
01:52:52,874 --> 01:52:54,457
She kept using us.

1501
01:52:55,291 --> 01:52:58,041
Sir, it seems like
Vidya Bagchi was hired..

1502
01:52:58,082 --> 01:53:00,041
...to find and kill Milan Damji.

1503
01:53:00,124 --> 01:53:03,082
And she used us to find Milan.

1504
01:53:03,166 --> 01:53:05,916
She wanted us to use
her as a scapegoat..

1505
01:53:05,999 --> 01:53:07,874
...to find Milan Damji.

1506
01:53:07,999 --> 01:53:10,041
And before we could arrest Shridhar.

1507
01:53:10,124 --> 01:53:11,666
Vidya killed him as well.

1508
01:53:11,749 --> 01:53:15,291
Sir, you gave Bhaskaran
and Milan to her yourself.

1509
01:53:15,416 --> 01:53:16,249
She knew.

1510
01:53:16,332 --> 01:53:18,999
'No one doubts a pregnant woman.'

1511
01:53:26,749 --> 01:53:28,791
'What did you take from my computer?'

1512
01:53:31,791 --> 01:53:33,457
Who is Satyoki?

1513
01:53:33,874 --> 01:53:35,541
'Arjun's charioteer.'

1514
01:53:39,749 --> 01:53:41,041
That's me, sir.

1515
01:53:41,082 --> 01:53:42,582
My name is Satyoki.

1516
01:53:44,249 --> 01:53:45,999
But who sent her?

1517
01:53:46,166 --> 01:53:47,916
And why did she help us?

1518
01:54:38,707 --> 01:54:40,041
'Arup.'

1519
01:54:44,291 --> 01:54:47,291
'Sorry, we couldn't
save your child.'

1520
01:54:56,082 --> 01:54:59,957
'Arup took up this assignment
only because I forced him to.'

1521
01:55:02,707 --> 01:55:05,166
'It's completely my fault.'

1522
01:55:26,207 --> 01:55:28,332
Arup must be really
happy today, Vidya.

1523
01:55:30,499 --> 01:55:32,249
He must be proud of you.

1524
01:55:34,457 --> 01:55:36,957
Because today you have accomplished..

1525
01:55:36,999 --> 01:55:38,832
...what we all couldn't.

1526
01:55:41,957 --> 01:55:44,082
You want to know a
strange thing, Colonel.

1527
01:55:45,457 --> 01:55:46,999
In the last few days..

1528
01:55:47,791 --> 01:55:50,041
...I completely forgot
that I am not pregnant.

1529
01:55:52,041 --> 01:55:53,916
It felt like..

1530
01:55:55,249 --> 01:55:57,499
...my child is still alive inside me.

1531
01:56:01,082 --> 01:56:02,874
It felt like..

1532
01:56:03,832 --> 01:56:05,749
I might find Arup as well.

1533
01:56:10,666 --> 01:56:13,707
I cannot live without them, Colonel.

1534
01:56:14,041 --> 01:56:16,707
I want my Arup back.

1535
01:56:18,291 --> 01:56:21,999
I want my child back.

1536
01:56:33,957 --> 01:56:36,249
'Today, two years later.'

1537
01:56:37,374 --> 01:56:40,082
'The family of those
killed in the Metro attack..'

1538
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:43,291
"..have finally got an answer.'

1539
01:56:49,832 --> 01:56:52,249
'Sometimes even
God's make mistakes.'

1540
01:56:53,499 --> 01:56:55,249
'Gods created demons.'

1541
01:56:55,374 --> 01:56:57,041
"Bestowed them with power.'

1542
01:56:57,749 --> 01:57:00,832
"But when they started
abusing that power..

1543
01:57:01,666 --> 01:57:04,041
...Gods created Mother Durga.'

1544
01:57:05,124 --> 01:57:07,374
'To destroy the demons.'

1545
01:57:10,666 --> 01:57:13,666
'It's said that Goddess Durga..

1546
01:57:14,082 --> 01:57:15,999
...was created by gathering
the strength of all the mothers'

1547
01:57:17,041 --> 01:57:18,999
'Every year the Mother
graces us with her presence.'

1548
01:57:19,707 --> 01:57:21,332
'Eliminates evil.'

1549
01:57:22,249 --> 01:57:24,041
'And goes back.'

1550
01:57:33,666 --> 01:57:37,332
'So that all of us can live
happily and peacefully..

1551
01:57:37,999 --> 01:57:41,041
"..Without any fear.'
