1
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,230
What's happening, Audrey?

2
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,711
What's the Naval Commander said?

3
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:30,431
Nothing, because I'm a girl and
he doesn't see the point of me.

4
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:32,551
But I'm sensing
they're really worried

5
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:35,632
the bad weather might be moving
the wreck about even more.

6
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:37,072
- Okay, keep me informed.
- Fraser?

7
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:39,152
Yeah?

8
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,408
I just want you to know that I will never
forgive you for sending me out here.

9
00:00:41,432 --> 00:00:42,832
Bring it up
at your next appraisal.

10
00:00:44,472 --> 00:00:47,553
I'll be bringing up my breakfast
into the North Sea first.

11
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,873
Okay, take care.

12
00:00:49,993 --> 00:00:53,393
We are evacuating this town
as a precaution.

13
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:56,434
Please report to one
of our information points.

14
00:00:58,874 --> 00:01:02,194
We are evacuating this town
as a precaution.

15
00:01:02,274 --> 00:01:05,555
Please report to one
of our information points.

16
00:01:15,756 --> 00:01:20,436
Okay, so our problem
remains the elderly

17
00:01:20,476 --> 00:01:22,276
who insist on staying
in their homes

18
00:01:22,356 --> 00:01:24,196
because the wreck
hasn't blown up

19
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:26,357
for 50 years etcetera, etcetera.

20
00:01:26,437 --> 00:01:31,197
Someone should remind them Leicester
City didn't win the league until 2016...

21
00:01:31,277 --> 00:01:35,918
The Prime Minister wishes me to thank you
for your efforts in evacuating the town.

22
00:01:35,998 --> 00:01:39,478
I'd like to think that everybody
but the most hard-line refusniks

23
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,638
will be out of here
by the evening.

24
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:44,918
And when we have received the
proper analysis from the Naval team

25
00:01:44,998 --> 00:01:47,119
then we can plan the next steps.

26
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:48,559
Thank you.

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,760
Bailout tested and clear.

28
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,280
We've got 2-8-0 in the bailout,
requesting mains.

29
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:06,601
Copy that. 2-8-0 in the bailout.

30
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:08,521
Bailout checked and complete.
Ready for mains.

31
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:14,521
Okay, standbys on
mains, ready to go.

32
00:02:58,686 --> 00:03:00,846
Hi, madam, good morning.
I'm not sure if you're aware

33
00:03:00,886 --> 00:03:03,726
but there's currently an urgent
evacuation taking place at the moment,

34
00:03:03,846 --> 00:03:07,167
so I'm going to have to ask you
to leave the property right now.

35
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,687
Mum,
they're coming round again.

36
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:15,288
Ridiculous.

37
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:36,010
What's that?

38
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,810
No idea.

39
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,890
I'm getting some...

40
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:48,411
it might be another tremor?

41
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:06,133
Bring him up.

42
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:08,013
Command to Dive Team Alpha,
prepare to surface.

43
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:11,013
Bring him up. Bring him up!

44
00:04:12,373 --> 00:04:15,254
Get him up now.
Get him up, get him up!

45
00:04:15,374 --> 00:04:18,134
Command to Dive team Alpha,
mission abort.

46
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,694
Surface now.

47
00:04:37,616 --> 00:04:39,376
These are
the scenes from Kent

48
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:41,256
after the significant
earth tremor

49
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:43,136
that took place
on Tuesday afternoon.

50
00:04:43,176 --> 00:04:46,937
Following inspections of a
sunken World War II munitions ship

51
00:04:47,017 --> 00:04:48,857
lying just offshore,

52
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:51,857
the government is considering the
evacuation of towns along the coast

53
00:04:51,937 --> 00:04:54,457
and we understand
that the Prime Minister

54
00:04:54,497 --> 00:04:57,498
has convened a full COBRA
to take place later in the day

55
00:04:57,618 --> 00:05:02,618
to discuss the possibility of a mandatory
evacuation of the areas most at risk.

56
00:05:03,818 --> 00:05:05,179
That's fracking.

57
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:07,619
What's fracking?

58
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,739
Causing all the earthquakes.

59
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:16,740
Problem is Greta,
they've stopped fracking...

60
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,580
Oh, too little too late.
Thanks, boomers.

61
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,301
Er, Gen X
and proud of it actually.

62
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:28,181
What are you actually proud of?

63
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:33,181
Oh, I dunno. Better music,
high-status reading habits,

64
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:36,382
and not having
all my predictable

65
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:40,302
and socially-conforming views
given to me by Twitter mobs.

66
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,582
You still murdered the planet.

67
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:47,183
Put the milk back in the fridge
or there will be hate speech.

68
00:06:06,705 --> 00:06:08,865
He's impressive.

69
00:06:08,945 --> 00:06:11,305
- Who is?
- Joseph.

70
00:06:12,265 --> 00:06:13,745
Big change from Archie.

71
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,186
You have reservations?

72
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:20,346
I would have told you
if I had reservations.

73
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:22,306
Well, as a person then...

74
00:06:22,386 --> 00:06:25,707
I don't really have an opinion
one way or another.

75
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:29,187
That's what worries me.

76
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,587
He's fine.

77
00:06:35,388 --> 00:06:38,628
We're different
which is also fine.

78
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,588
The party base likes him.

79
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:46,469
Socially conservative,
working class, self-made...

80
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:49,029
Which is why I agree
he's a good appointment

81
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:51,029
because any more defections
and we're fucked.

82
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:52,829
Archie's on maneuvers
by the way.

83
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:55,750
Wants the whip back.

84
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,310
You wouldn't...

85
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,270
I most certainly would
if I deemed it necessary.

86
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,830
Look, none of these bastards
are my friends, Anna.

87
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,391
It's purely strategic.

88
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:11,711
How's Ellie
getting on in Santiago?

89
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:15,632
Well, the trial took
a lot out of her.

90
00:07:16,832 --> 00:07:18,312
She has a new boyfriend.

91
00:07:18,392 --> 00:07:22,752
A Chilean anarchist
who sets fire to tube stations.

92
00:07:22,832 --> 00:07:24,832
Take that, neo-liberals.

93
00:07:30,513 --> 00:07:32,193
Home Secretary.

94
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:34,873
Congratulations, Joseph.

95
00:07:34,953 --> 00:07:36,610
If you were a drinking man, I
would offer you a nip of something.

96
00:07:36,634 --> 00:07:38,314
Thank you, Prime Minister.

97
00:07:38,394 --> 00:07:40,450
For the time being, I am
enjoying reading people online

98
00:07:40,474 --> 00:07:42,050
announcing that I am no longer
a black man.

99
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:45,195
Well, real rebels join
the establishment, I guess.

100
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:47,595
Real rebels follow the truth.

101
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:48,595
Like Paul.

102
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,155
- Paul?
- Saint Paul.

103
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:52,515
Oh, yes.

104
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:54,715
Wasn't so great on women
as I recall.

105
00:07:54,835 --> 00:07:56,716
Especially short-haired ones.

106
00:07:56,836 --> 00:08:00,596
Yes, he did give the Corinthians
some grief on coiffure as I recall.

107
00:08:00,636 --> 00:08:03,036
Paul's most important message
was love.

108
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:04,716
Without love there is nothing

109
00:08:04,836 --> 00:08:07,197
and only His love
can save us all.

110
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,957
Well, amen to that.

111
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:12,957
Now that you have been sworn in,

112
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:15,174
you can attend the COBRA we
have called on the earthquakes in Kent

113
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:16,718
which starts in, uh...

114
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:19,278
Five minutes ago.

115
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,518
Well it's briefing room J
actually but don't tell anyone.

116
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,639
It destroys the mystique.

117
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,319
Good morning, everyone.

118
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:33,679
Most of you know
Joseph Obasi, of course.

119
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,080
This is his first COBRA
as Home Secretary,

120
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,480
so I'll let him take the
chair...

121
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,200
Thank you, Prime Minister.

122
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,200
I believe, Fraser,

123
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,601
you will be updating us on the situation
in Kent and the sunken munition ship.

124
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:48,241
The naval teams
are down there now.

125
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:52,241
There was some concern that the hull
was damaged by these earth tremors.

126
00:08:52,321 --> 00:08:55,962
Am I correct in thinking that some reports
suggest that the long immersion in water

127
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:58,218
will mean that there is nothing
to detonate the explosives.

128
00:08:58,242 --> 00:09:00,122
Yes, that is correct.

129
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:04,682
But there is also speculation that
copper azide could be produced

130
00:09:04,722 --> 00:09:07,843
which might be sufficient
to detonate the munitions.

131
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,323
So do we evacuate?

132
00:09:09,443 --> 00:09:11,323
Huge resistance to that.

133
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:13,323
So we make it mandatory.

134
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:15,724
I think
that's the only option

135
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:18,844
given the reluctance of the
elderly to leave their homes.

136
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:21,204
Okay, so let's say the tremor
has shifted the wreck

137
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:23,484
and damaged
the hull significantly.

138
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,605
Let's say it does blow up...

139
00:09:25,685 --> 00:09:28,205
- The damage would be enormous.
- How enormous?

140
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:32,605
Reshaping the Kent
coastline enormous.

141
00:09:35,846 --> 00:09:39,566
I'd refer you to the Nova
Scotia incident in 1917

142
00:09:39,606 --> 00:09:42,606
where the Mont Blanc explosion
took out Halifax

143
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:45,006
at the cost of 2,000 lives.

144
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:46,967
And as we saw in Beirut,

145
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,727
catastrophic damage to buildings
and infrastructure and terrible injuries.

146
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,967
We are also very concerned
about subsequent flooding.

147
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:58,968
But it's been so long
since the ship went down,

148
00:09:59,088 --> 00:10:00,688
and I know you hate it
when I say this...

149
00:10:00,728 --> 00:10:03,968
Uh, don't tell me...
we just don't really know?

150
00:10:04,088 --> 00:10:06,489
It probably won't blow up.

151
00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:08,369
Why haven't we dealt
with this wreck before?

152
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:09,929
Too hard.

153
00:10:09,969 --> 00:10:12,689
More danger of setting
it off by prodding it.

154
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:15,570
If the earthquake
has damaged the hull,

155
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,250
then I would say we have to go
for mandatory evacuation.

156
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,690
Get things moving immediately.

157
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:15,438
Right, lads, at the back,
come on, move to the front.

158
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:16,982
Those tables are set up
for tonight.

159
00:12:17,022 --> 00:12:19,342
So don't be messing about
on the coach to Chertsey.

160
00:12:19,382 --> 00:12:23,342
Remember you gotta bring ID with the
age on it or you won't be allowed to play.

161
00:12:23,462 --> 00:12:25,383
Oi, sir, what's happening?

162
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:28,983
Sorry, did I say
I had finished, lads?

163
00:12:29,023 --> 00:12:30,463
But, sir, it's the helicopter.

164
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:32,559
I don't care if it's
the International Space Station,

165
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,503
sit down and listen
while I'm talking

166
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:36,720
or I'll be using you to demonstrate
how to do a spear tackle.

167
00:12:36,744 --> 00:12:38,704
Come on, that's it,
sit down, sit down!

168
00:12:38,744 --> 00:12:41,744
Alright, we've all seen a
helicopter before lads, come on.

169
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:43,744
Down you get,
come on, there we go.

170
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,747
- Sir...
- Lads, get down... lads!

171
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:34,629
Mr. Hadleigh!

172
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,230
Sir? Mr. Hadleigh!

173
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:11,153
And speaking
of dangerous old wrecks...

174
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:14,633
Ah, Peter, thanks for coming.

175
00:14:17,394 --> 00:14:18,834
What's this about?

176
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:21,634
Oh, you know. How's tricks?
What's the story?

177
00:14:23,354 --> 00:14:25,331
- Thought you might want to congratulate me.
- On what?

178
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:26,995
On holding my seat
at the election

179
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:29,115
in spite of everything
they threw at me.

180
00:14:29,155 --> 00:14:30,475
Seventeen votes.

181
00:14:30,515 --> 00:14:32,715
Made it all the sweeter.

182
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:35,636
Imagine his face watching
that second recount!

183
00:14:35,756 --> 00:14:37,812
He still won. Which after
everything they had been through...

184
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,516
A majority of nine
is a tricky thing.

185
00:14:39,596 --> 00:14:43,156
Especially now the opposition
has a grown-up in charge.

186
00:14:43,236 --> 00:14:45,757
- Maybe.
- Anyway...

187
00:14:45,837 --> 00:14:48,397
I still haven't had the chance
to congratulate you

188
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:51,837
on somehow walking
out of court a free man.

189
00:14:51,877 --> 00:14:54,037
I really don't have time
for the badinage, Archie.

190
00:14:54,117 --> 00:14:55,518
Debatable because you
may be free

191
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:57,998
but you are also unemployable.

192
00:14:58,038 --> 00:15:01,038
- Always a pleasure to see you, Archie...
- Okay, okay!

193
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:05,639
Let's cut to the chase.

194
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:10,479
First, they restore the whip.

195
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:12,879
Then I get a seat in Cabinet.

196
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,760
And I want you to help me.

197
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,576
I know what you're going to say
to me, "This is just trolling Robert."

198
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,880
This is just trolling Robert.

199
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:25,121
Well,
of course partly, yes,

200
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:28,761
and quite a big part
to be fair, but also...

201
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:32,601
say what you like about him
but he has an eye for talent.

202
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:36,762
And what's the price,
Mephistopheles?

203
00:15:38,242 --> 00:15:40,842
I think you've just answered
your own question.

204
00:15:44,482 --> 00:15:46,403
We're gonna start
as we always do

205
00:15:46,523 --> 00:15:49,843
on the Morbid Symptoms podcast
and jump straight in, so Francine Bridge...

206
00:15:51,363 --> 00:15:52,763
Why did you do it?

207
00:15:52,843 --> 00:15:54,043
Why did I do what?

208
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:56,484
Join the Tories.

209
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:59,844
After so many "comrades" ordering me to
fuck off and do precisely that, you mean?

210
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:02,604
And I didn't join the Tories
of course, I took a job.

211
00:16:02,644 --> 00:16:03,884
And resigned from it.

212
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,605
Yes.

213
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:10,765
So we know that Sutherland has
that difficult majority of nine.

214
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:13,165
But, what about
his other problems?

215
00:16:13,245 --> 00:16:15,766
The Singer inquiry into
the shootings at Junction 23

216
00:16:15,846 --> 00:16:18,006
during the solar storm
will report soon.

217
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:20,766
That's right. I just hope
that it brings justice

218
00:16:20,886 --> 00:16:23,366
and some closure for the innocent
photographer that was shot.

219
00:16:23,486 --> 00:16:26,087
What was your view of the collapse
of the Rachel Sutherland trial?

220
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:29,007
Well, the jury heard the evidence.
They couldn't reach a verdict...

221
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:32,007
Because posh white mums
don't belong in prison?

222
00:16:32,047 --> 00:16:35,368
Well, that depends
if they've committed a crime.

223
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:37,368
How about
their drug-dealing daughters?

224
00:16:37,488 --> 00:16:38,944
I think the sentence
for Ellie Sutherland

225
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:41,008
was appropriate
under the circumstances,

226
00:16:41,048 --> 00:16:43,568
but I don't know enough about
the case to have an opinion on it.

227
00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:49,369
Francine Bridge demonstrating
that whatever her other virtues,

228
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:54,129
she has absolutely no
understanding of the Zeitgeist.

229
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:56,250
Uh, okay. Ask me another one.

230
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,170
Ever kissed a Tory?

231
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,490
Oh, please.

232
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,850
So that's where
you draw the line?

233
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,730
Oligarch plus helicopter
crash normally equals...

234
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,851
Investigations are underway.

235
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:09,411
What about the teacher?

236
00:17:09,491 --> 00:17:11,531
A rugby coach
whose name was Graham Hadleigh.

237
00:17:11,611 --> 00:17:13,731
Wife and two kids.

238
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:16,452
He was killed instantly
by shrapnel from the crash.

239
00:17:16,532 --> 00:17:18,052
His poor children.

240
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:21,772
Mikael Kostenko had
just attended the varsity match.

241
00:17:21,852 --> 00:17:24,572
Our Ukrainian sources say
he was en route to Brazil

242
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:26,773
to sort out a land contract
in the Amazon.

243
00:17:26,853 --> 00:17:29,173
Pretty sure Archie's been
on his yacht.

244
00:17:29,253 --> 00:17:33,093
Along with politicians of many different
stripes from Tony Blair to Bill Clinton.

245
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:35,013
That's just one stripe actually.

246
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,414
If it was sabotage
or something like that,

247
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:40,574
then I'm guessing
it's not down to the Norwegians.

248
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:42,254
Well, it would be
easier to list those

249
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:43,774
who didn't have
a grudge against him.

250
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,615
He pissed off both the Ukrainian
and Russian governments

251
00:17:46,735 --> 00:17:49,535
and had several powerful rivals.

252
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:52,095
He is heavily implicated
in recent corruption cases

253
00:17:52,215 --> 00:17:56,256
involving both the Israeli Prime
Minister and the Brazilian President,

254
00:17:56,296 --> 00:17:58,056
with whom he is good friends.

255
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:01,296
Why was a helicopter
taking off from...

256
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,296
The school next door lets
VIP helicopters use the land

257
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,537
during rugby games
to raise funds.

258
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:08,697
There had apparently
been some complaints

259
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:10,337
from parents
worried about safety.

260
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:13,337
You can expect
blow-back on that.

261
00:18:13,457 --> 00:18:15,778
School forced
to rent out playing fields

262
00:18:15,818 --> 00:18:19,058
for oligarch's helicopter
equals blood on our hands.

263
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,698
I will keep you informed.

264
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:27,859
We are evacuating
this town as a precaution.

265
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:31,019
The hull is very corroded.
Any movement is problematic.

266
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:33,459
- Is it going to blow up?
- It's very hard to say.

267
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:35,500
Okay.

268
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,500
You're evacuating the town,
which is sensible.

269
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,860
Leave the ship to us.

270
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:52,101
I've booked us a B&amp;B outside
the evacuation area, down in Margate...

271
00:18:52,221 --> 00:18:55,422
Oh, great. I can pay a visit
to Olby's Studio One.

272
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:57,342
What's that?

273
00:18:57,462 --> 00:18:59,782
The old Dugout.
Mod weekenders...

274
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:01,782
Ah, I didn't know
you were a Mod.

275
00:19:01,862 --> 00:19:04,022
I'm not gonna come to work
just in a parka, am I?

276
00:19:10,263 --> 00:19:11,583
What's your thing then?

277
00:19:11,703 --> 00:19:14,783
Outside of planning
for national emergencies.

278
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:17,224
I don't really have
any interests.

279
00:19:17,264 --> 00:19:19,024
Just work, work, work.

280
00:19:19,064 --> 00:19:20,824
Weren't you seeing
that Francine Bridge?

281
00:19:23,424 --> 00:19:26,705
- Sort of, but it didn't... it didn't really...
- It didn't...

282
00:19:26,785 --> 00:19:29,225
I'm not really good
with relationships.

283
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:31,985
My ex-wife called me
a slow puncture.

284
00:19:33,065 --> 00:19:34,345
That's not very nice.

285
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,266
She might have a point though.

286
00:19:36,306 --> 00:19:37,866
Well, never mind,

287
00:19:37,986 --> 00:19:39,746
not everybody can say
that they're top dog

288
00:19:39,786 --> 00:19:41,826
when it comes
to civil contingencies planning.

289
00:19:43,786 --> 00:19:46,507
I mean, I dunno, my default position
is usually to support the woman.

290
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:49,787
Rightly, so probably.
Usually the man's fault.

291
00:19:52,187 --> 00:19:53,827
Yeah. Not always though.

292
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,268
My dad was one of the softest
people you could've ever met.

293
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:06,349
All he wanted to do was go
down the boozer with his mates,

294
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:08,989
listen to The Faces,
and watch the Wall.

295
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:10,069
The what?

296
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:11,429
No one likes us?

297
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:14,269
- Millwall Football Club.
- Oh.

298
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,750
He was a school caretaker

299
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,550
and he wore the same hat every
year at Christmas that lit up for the kids.

300
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,631
But he was also fat
and unhealthy so...

301
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:31,431
he died alone in hospital,

302
00:20:31,511 --> 00:20:33,511
we couldn't go and see him,
say goodbye.

303
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:40,272
- That's pretty fucked up.
- Yep.

304
00:20:42,512 --> 00:20:44,312
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

305
00:20:44,432 --> 00:20:47,513
we are Tiny Flaws and our first
tune is called Wrong Kind of Blue.

306
00:20:58,034 --> 00:20:59,074
Yeah?

307
00:21:00,354 --> 00:21:02,354
Never underestimate a Mod.

308
00:21:09,075 --> 00:21:11,995
Expel a few
"diplomats," right?

309
00:21:12,035 --> 00:21:13,995
That's usually the format.

310
00:21:15,516 --> 00:21:17,476
That man was a volunteer, Anna.

311
00:21:19,076 --> 00:21:21,876
He gave up his free time
to coach disadvantaged kids.

312
00:21:23,436 --> 00:21:24,596
I know.

313
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:29,757
But can we really afford a
major diplomatic incident right now

314
00:21:29,797 --> 00:21:32,277
when there's all this shit
going on around us?

315
00:21:33,757 --> 00:21:36,838
Let's sleep on it.
Discuss it tomorrow.

316
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:40,438
Sleep.
What's that again?

317
00:21:40,518 --> 00:21:41,534
Are you still having trouble
with that?

318
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:42,838
Yes, and please don't tell me...

319
00:21:42,878 --> 00:21:45,038
As soon as my head
hits the pillow I'm gone!

320
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,600
What's happening with Sam?

321
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,960
He's still shacked up
with his 16-year-old.

322
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,281
- Sixteen!
- Oh, okay, 36. Same difference though.

323
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,561
Worse possibly.

324
00:22:15,882 --> 00:22:18,482
Do you think you might
be a little bit depressed?

325
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:22,802
No.

326
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:24,802
Good.

327
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,323
I think I'm tired, stressed
and a bit down in the dumps

328
00:22:29,443 --> 00:22:31,803
for reasons I don't really need
a shrink to explain.

329
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,083
I just had to ask.

330
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:35,804
Mental Health is...

331
00:22:35,884 --> 00:22:37,644
- No laughing matter?
- It's important.

332
00:22:40,044 --> 00:22:42,964
I don't want you thinking it's all
about me and my needs the whole time.

333
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:50,085
Duty done.

334
00:22:53,285 --> 00:22:55,766
You were really close
to Anna Marshall though?

335
00:22:55,806 --> 00:22:58,766
I was and I still think
she's brilliant...

336
00:22:59,246 --> 00:23:00,726
But...

337
00:23:00,806 --> 00:23:03,846
Elite schools,
elite university, elite values.

338
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,727
Same.

339
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:08,487
What's wrong with that?

340
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:11,487
You'll be telling me punctuality
and the written word

341
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:13,567
are all part
of white privilege next.

342
00:23:13,647 --> 00:23:15,704
Alright, well, I'll tell you what I'll
be telling you, thank you very much.

343
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,584
Which is that you have
to at least contemplate the idea

344
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:19,568
that yours isn't
the only angle of view.

345
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,768
Sure but you have to think it's the best
one or you would presumably change it?

346
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:27,289
Anyway, I didn't belong there.

347
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:28,465
You don't believe
in white privilege?

348
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:29,769
Just look at a COBRA meeting.

349
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,489
I never said
I didn't believe in it...

350
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:37,490
Confirmation that I'm on
the Breakfast Show tomorrow.

351
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,890
Discussing the Kostenko case.

352
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,010
You think it was a hit?

353
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,810
Oligarch plus helicopter crash?

354
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,611
Nah,
nothing suspicious there.

355
00:23:47,731 --> 00:23:49,491
You better get
an early night, then.

356
00:23:49,571 --> 00:23:52,291
Oh, I'm not an early night
kind of person really.

357
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,532
I am.

358
00:23:58,092 --> 00:23:59,332
Shame.

359
00:24:00,812 --> 00:24:01,972
Have you got my mobile?

360
00:24:02,052 --> 00:24:03,492
Don't think so.

361
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:05,813
Hold on. I've got yours,
so I'll just ping it over.

362
00:24:05,853 --> 00:24:07,053
Why?

363
00:24:07,093 --> 00:24:09,013
In case you ever want to use it.

364
00:24:12,293 --> 00:24:13,533
Got it.

365
00:24:15,214 --> 00:24:17,094
- Bye.
- Bye.

366
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:06,899
- So... working.
- Mmm.

367
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,299
I didn't know if I'd be able
to do my job again.

368
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:15,620
Yeah, I know.

369
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,300
Still, work is good.

370
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,900
But I've also been thinking
about holidays.

371
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,820
- Oh, right...
- You hate them, I know.

372
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,381
But I've been looking
at places in the Atacama

373
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:31,021
and I thought maybe we could go
and see Ellie.

374
00:25:31,061 --> 00:25:34,501
We'll head up there together. Stars
are meant to be amazing apparently.

375
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:36,982
No, it would be good.

376
00:25:37,062 --> 00:25:39,822
To be together as a family.

377
00:25:48,303 --> 00:25:49,263
Eleanor...

378
00:25:49,303 --> 00:25:51,343
It was a hit.

379
00:25:51,463 --> 00:25:54,503
We're almost certain they used an
armored drone to shoot down the helicopter.

380
00:25:54,543 --> 00:25:56,544
It's a complicated situation.

381
00:25:56,584 --> 00:25:59,064
It might be a boat
we don't want to rock.

382
00:25:59,104 --> 00:26:00,664
I'll be right down.

383
00:26:28,067 --> 00:26:29,547
Who's this, then?

384
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,787
This has just come in
from our investigation.

385
00:26:31,827 --> 00:26:35,588
Klara Lechkova
is a Russian citizen.

386
00:26:35,668 --> 00:26:39,068
She's picked up a couple of
times on CCTV walking the tow-path

387
00:26:39,108 --> 00:26:42,628
which adjoins the school where
the helicopter was due to take off.

388
00:26:42,748 --> 00:26:44,308
Where was
the drone controlled from?

389
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:47,349
She also purchased a scooter,

390
00:26:47,469 --> 00:26:50,589
which we believe may have been
used to leave the scene afterwards.

391
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:54,229
And she's vanished
off the face of the earth.

392
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:59,630
Klara is the niece of a member of
the Duma with links to the President.

393
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,830
Her uncle is
a decorated GRU member

394
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,830
and also has close links
to separatists

395
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:07,311
operating out of
the Donetsk People's Republic.

396
00:27:07,391 --> 00:27:08,631
Who's the sidekick?

397
00:27:08,751 --> 00:27:12,071
Rodrigo Lenin Araya. Colombian.

398
00:27:12,111 --> 00:27:15,592
His father was a senior commandant
of the FARC guerrilla movement

399
00:27:15,632 --> 00:27:19,112
murdered by
right-wing paramilitaries.

400
00:27:19,232 --> 00:27:23,832
Araya studied at the People's
Friendship University in Moscow.

401
00:27:23,872 --> 00:27:25,633
We believe he is an SVR asset.

402
00:27:25,753 --> 00:27:27,353
Well, this is all
an enormous relief.

403
00:27:27,473 --> 00:27:29,593
I thought things
might get complicated.

404
00:27:29,673 --> 00:27:31,473
Bottom line:
It was a Russian hit.

405
00:27:31,553 --> 00:27:35,514
They couldn't get close to
Kostenko so they used a drone.

406
00:27:35,594 --> 00:27:37,794
And killed an innocent man.

407
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:39,754
I don't think
that was part of the plan.

408
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:41,474
So I assume
they're out of the country?

409
00:27:41,554 --> 00:27:43,594
Well, you assume wrong.

410
00:27:43,634 --> 00:27:47,635
They sprayed out a bunch of decoys
first to see if we tried to pick them up.

411
00:27:47,755 --> 00:27:49,475
They are at a safe house still.

412
00:27:49,555 --> 00:27:51,075
We can arrest them?

413
00:27:51,115 --> 00:27:53,875
Oh, we can.
Question is...

414
00:27:54,915 --> 00:27:56,476
Do we want to?

415
00:27:59,356 --> 00:28:02,556
A nice dilemma
for a new Home Secretary.

416
00:28:21,758 --> 00:28:24,638
Okay, perfect. It is about
two hours wait, I'm afraid.

417
00:28:24,758 --> 00:28:28,039
But you will be on the next bus.
Have you had breakfast? No?

418
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:30,319
Help yourself to breakfast,
sit wherever you like.

419
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,999
Can you make sure
that first bus is gone by 12:00?

420
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:36,600
Good morning. Now look, I wasn't
expecting Egyptian cotton or anything

421
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,840
but those sheets
were like sandpaper.

422
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,400
Some nice tinned tomatoes and
bacon fat for breakfast, though.

423
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,281
Are you sure you want
to come out with us?

424
00:28:46,321 --> 00:28:47,921
It's pretty choppy out there.

425
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:49,321
It's me coming out.

426
00:28:50,121 --> 00:28:51,841
I know.

427
00:28:51,921 --> 00:28:54,281
Why are you looking
at him, then?

428
00:28:54,321 --> 00:28:57,402
Okay, if you insist,
I'll see you down there.

429
00:29:01,562 --> 00:29:03,562
He reminds me of an Action Man
I used to have.

430
00:29:03,602 --> 00:29:06,043
- You had an Action Man?
- I had about six.

431
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:10,403
You don't have to go out
if you don't want to, you know?

432
00:29:10,523 --> 00:29:11,843
I don't want to.

433
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:15,324
- Okay...
- But I do have to.

434
00:29:15,404 --> 00:29:18,044
Otherwise, I'll sit around
thinking of how I should have gone

435
00:29:18,084 --> 00:29:20,284
and I'll just drive myself mad.

436
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:22,324
You might even enjoy it.

437
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:24,844
Okay.

438
00:29:32,325 --> 00:29:34,845
Okay, targets are on the move.

439
00:29:34,885 --> 00:29:37,606
Leaving early morning
with little traffic.

440
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:40,286
Easier to spot a trail.

441
00:29:40,326 --> 00:29:41,646
What's happening?

442
00:29:41,766 --> 00:29:45,327
They're moving.
We think it's Stansted, though.

443
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:47,847
So what are we going to do?

444
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:52,367
If we let them go,
everything will be a lot easier.

445
00:29:52,487 --> 00:29:55,087
Impunity often is.

446
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:59,488
There could be consequences
that go beyond diplomatic exchanges.

447
00:30:01,128 --> 00:30:03,128
I know that.

448
00:30:03,248 --> 00:30:06,689
But if we just let them go,
they will know that, too,

449
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:09,569
and that will also have
consequences down the line.

450
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:12,089
Okay, then. It's your call.

451
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:15,930
Yes, it is.

452
00:30:38,932 --> 00:30:40,852
Okay. And over.

453
00:30:44,612 --> 00:30:46,109
So there was another
earth tremor last night.

454
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:47,533
Yeah.

455
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:49,053
Any idea of the impact...

456
00:30:49,093 --> 00:30:51,333
That's what we're going
out to take a look at.

457
00:30:51,373 --> 00:30:53,933
- Okay but...
- Sorry and no offense,

458
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:58,894
but I'm not entirely sure
what the point of you is.

459
00:30:59,014 --> 00:31:01,654
- What the point of me is?
- I meant being here.

460
00:31:01,774 --> 00:31:05,815
Why don't you guys just do your
job and let me do mine, yeah?

461
00:31:08,135 --> 00:31:11,095
No, fair play, it's a question I
do ask myself from time to time.

462
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:14,855
Okay, well,
the point of me right now is

463
00:31:14,895 --> 00:31:18,056
I am the eyes and ears of the
Civil Contingencies Secretariat.

464
00:31:18,096 --> 00:31:20,936
Now that may not mean
much to you, Captain Pugwash,

465
00:31:21,056 --> 00:31:23,536
but it makes me the eyes and
ears of Number 10 Downing Street,

466
00:31:23,616 --> 00:31:25,777
and hence,
the British Prime Minister.

467
00:31:25,857 --> 00:31:28,937
So if you've got a problem, then I
suggest you take it up directly with him.

468
00:31:37,338 --> 00:31:39,178
Suspects are through security,
Terminal 1.

469
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:41,898
Okay. Keep eyes on.

470
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:47,499
Do you want to put
Lightfingers into play?

471
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:48,939
What's Lightfingers?

472
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:50,939
A world of pain
for very little reward.

473
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:53,099
- What?
- -There's still time to abort the mission.

474
00:31:53,139 --> 00:31:55,860
- And it won't bring Graham Hadleigh back.
- -No, no.

475
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,140
You don't get to kill an innocent British
citizen and then just waltz off home

476
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,580
with a new handbag
and a bottle of Johnnie Walker.

477
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,940
Take the bastards in.

478
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:08,941
Do what he says.

479
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:11,581
- Again. What's Lightfingers?
- Watch.

480
00:32:17,182 --> 00:32:19,862
Excuse me, Madam.

481
00:32:19,942 --> 00:32:22,862
Would you mind stepping back
into the store for a moment, please?

482
00:32:22,902 --> 00:32:24,382
Yes, I would mind.

483
00:32:24,502 --> 00:32:26,463
They've called my flight,
I haven't done anything.

484
00:32:26,503 --> 00:32:29,863
If you could just show me the
receipt for the item in your bag.

485
00:32:29,943 --> 00:32:31,943
There is no item
in my bag.

486
00:32:32,063 --> 00:32:33,103
What's going on?

487
00:32:37,864 --> 00:32:41,104
Target on the move...

488
00:32:42,864 --> 00:32:45,305
Oi! You! Stop!

489
00:32:45,345 --> 00:32:47,865
Out the way! Move.
Move to the side!

490
00:32:52,585 --> 00:32:54,505
Stop!

491
00:32:54,585 --> 00:32:56,866
Armed Police! Show me your
hands! Get down on the floor!

492
00:32:56,946 --> 00:32:58,626
I am Rodrigo Araya.

493
00:32:58,666 --> 00:33:01,146
I am a Colombian
human rights activist.

494
00:33:01,266 --> 00:33:03,346
They are trying
to make me disappear.

495
00:33:03,426 --> 00:33:05,106
I am a human rights activist!

496
00:33:05,146 --> 00:33:06,867
A human rights activist.

497
00:33:06,907 --> 00:33:09,547
Target in custody.
All officers stand down.

498
00:33:11,187 --> 00:33:12,787
Pull their files for me.

499
00:33:15,308 --> 00:33:17,148
So what now?

500
00:33:17,268 --> 00:33:20,908
Now we charge her with shoplifting
and him with resisting arrest.

501
00:33:21,028 --> 00:33:23,084
- But those are minor...
- -We remand them in custody

502
00:33:23,108 --> 00:33:26,709
on the basis that they are
suspected of other unspecified crimes

503
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:29,869
and-or the possible commission
of future crimes.

504
00:33:29,949 --> 00:33:33,109
And we...
what, we just wait now?

505
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:34,429
Yep.

506
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:37,030
Well, we've chosen
to prod the snake.

507
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:40,670
Now let's see if it bites
or just rattles a bit.

508
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,350
Update me in an hour.

509
00:34:19,714 --> 00:34:23,114
Please report to one
of our information points.

510
00:34:53,277 --> 00:34:54,797
Jesus.

511
00:35:04,758 --> 00:35:08,039
You all need to make
your way to the buses, now.

512
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:10,079
The evacuation is mandatory.

513
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,960
What's that?

514
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,041
No idea. I'm getting some...

515
00:35:33,161 --> 00:35:34,841
It might be another tremor?

516
00:35:45,082 --> 00:35:47,003
What the hell
is going on down there?

517
00:35:50,043 --> 00:35:52,003
That's not a tremor.
Bring him up.

518
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:55,244
Command to Dive Team Alpha,
prepare to surface.

519
00:35:55,324 --> 00:35:57,004
Bring him up!

520
00:35:57,084 --> 00:35:58,124
Bring him up!

521
00:36:20,006 --> 00:36:24,406
Run, now! Get to higher ground!

522
00:36:34,287 --> 00:36:35,288
Come on!

523
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:38,008
Go! Go! Go!

524
00:38:00,816 --> 00:38:04,936
First reports suggest heavy
casualties among emergency teams.

525
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,993
- Have you heard from Fraser?
- No, we can't reach him.

526
00:38:07,017 --> 00:38:09,697
He was down there
with his entire team.

527
00:38:09,777 --> 00:38:11,537
There are mass casualties
on the seafront.

528
00:38:11,617 --> 00:38:14,537
Glass, scalding water,
collapsed masonry.

529
00:38:14,617 --> 00:38:15,938
Have we got a live link yet?

530
00:38:16,018 --> 00:38:17,474
There have been problems
connecting to the feed.

531
00:38:17,498 --> 00:38:18,858
We need to get that link up.

532
00:38:23,738 --> 00:38:27,179
Will someone please tell me what's
going on with our communication system?

533
00:38:29,499 --> 00:38:33,619
SRT to Control, we seem to be
experiencing comms malfunction.

534
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:36,740
SRT to Control,
are you receiving?

535
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,780
This is SRT, come in, Control.

536
00:39:59,068 --> 00:40:02,308
GCHQ are reporting
a massive cyber-attack.

537
00:40:02,428 --> 00:40:06,149
It's taken out ECON. The new
Emergency Services comms Network.

538
00:40:06,189 --> 00:40:09,669
It means they can't talk to
each other or send us live links.

539
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:11,549
You know what this is,
don't you?

540
00:40:11,629 --> 00:40:13,549
This is their bloody answer
to the arrests.

541
00:40:13,629 --> 00:40:16,150
No, we can't have this. Not now.

542
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,430
Not in the middle
of a natural disaster.

543
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,006
There's a message embedded in the
malware they've used to crash the system.

544
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:24,110
- What kind of message?
- Ruin Brittania.

545
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:35,832
National Cyber Defense have seen
nothing like this before.

546
00:40:35,952 --> 00:40:37,872
Is it Russian?

547
00:40:37,992 --> 00:40:40,448
They have no idea. The signature
coding is like nothing we've seen before.

548
00:40:40,472 --> 00:40:43,712
Is it connected to the
assassination? Who's behind this?

549
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:45,753
Honestly, we don't have
any information...

550
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:48,633
Then find out and bring me
some fucking answers!
