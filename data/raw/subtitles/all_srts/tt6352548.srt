00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,627
70 years ago,
when the citizens of India...

2
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,605
...|iberated this countnj,
I guess they had no clue...

3
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,265
...that, even after achieving
independence some people...

4
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,036
...wou|d still have to
fight for their rights.

5
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:21,170
These three common citizens
ofthis independent countn]...

6
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,440
Jagaavar Chaudhanj...

7
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,537
Vinay Sharma...

8
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,173
And, Arjun Singh...

9
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,344
Are fighting for their self-respect,
their rights.

10
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,748
Their battle has finally
reached the final stage.

11
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:35,490
We will soon find out whether
they will get their right or not.

12
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,221
But, to find out how
they got in this predicament...

13
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:42,062
...we'|| take you to their village
Jangethi, a few months from now.

14
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,265
Leave me buddy, I don't want to go.

15
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,203
"Some wink at me...

16
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,107
While some whistle."

17
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,077
"Some wink at me...

18
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,583
While some whistle."

19
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,518
"Boys keep hovering all around me."

20
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,213
"|'m like a kite...

21
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,120
with a fair complexion."

22
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:42,524
"Look at my capricious gait."

23
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:47,391
"Oh, my...these city girls..."

24
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,594
"Oh, my...these city girls..."

25
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:54,264
"Oh, my...these city girls..."

26
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,672
"Oh, my...these city girls..."

27
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,233
"|'m like a kite...

28
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,040
with a fair complexion."

29
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:04,275
"These city girls are so beautiful."

30
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,147
"And their capricious gait."

31
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,414
"Oh, my...these city girls..."

32
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,719
"Oh, my...these city girls..."

33
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,358
"Oh, my...these city girls..."

34
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,723
Hey, are you blind?

35
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,575
"There's a fire raging in my head,
beloved."

36
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,705
"Even/one's head pines for me."

37
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:40,185
"| am the king of my head."

38
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,250
"But your eyes make got me high."

39
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,380
"Give me your head."

40
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,354
"Give me your head."

41
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,789
"Give me your head."

42
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,391
"Don't be stubborn, sweetheart"

43
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,656
"Oh, my...these city girls..."

44
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:55,165
"Oh, my...these city girls..."

45
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:58,431
"Oh, my...these city girls..."

46
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:02,200
"Oh, my...these city girls..."

47
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,098
Who are you waiting for, baby?

48
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:05,165

I'll come over in
10 days with my parents.

52
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,044
To discuss our marriage.

53
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,050
Promise?
- Mark my words, darling.

54
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:13,641
Come now,

55
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,209

56
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,264
"Some wait for me in the market..."

57
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:36,198
"Some eye me..."

58
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,433
"Some hold my hand..."

59
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,407
"While others follow
me wherever I go."

60
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:46,007
"Don't drag me in

61
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,315
"| am really scared of girls."

62
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:52,118
"| have a shy nature."

63
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,419
"Oh, my...these city girls..."

64
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:57,655
"Oh, my...these city girls..."

65
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,424
"One minute they let
you dwell in their head..."

66
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,159
"...and they next minute
they chuck you out."

67
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,724
"They give you a hard time."

68
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,231
"These city girls..."

69
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:09,399
"Oh, my...these city girls..."

70
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,671
"Oh, my...these city girls..."

"Oh, my...these city girls..."

73
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:23,182
"Oh, my...these city girls..."

74
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:26,554
"Oh, my...these city girls..."

75
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,399
Carefu|...don't slip.

76
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,767
Pooja, look after the kids.

77
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,606
Hello, are you ready yet?

78
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:43,732
Keep it down.

79
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,307
I had already kept
your clothes ready for you.

80
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,538
Coming.

81
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,513
Hello...

82
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:54,550
Your face is glowing...

00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:59,420
...|ike you're getting engaged.
- I'm glowing out ofjoy.

84
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,520
And, you're glowing too.

85
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,719
Be quiet...

86
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,692
Honestly...

87
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:09,498
When we got married,
you looked like a bomb.

88
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,159
But now, you look like an atom bomb.

89
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,364
Be quiet...

90
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,439
What if someone overhears us?

91
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,497
So what?

92
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,467
They will say officer
is still romantic. Isn't it?

93
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,107
Look there.
- Where?

94
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,114
There...

95
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:31,019
Let it be...
- Pout... Pout...

96
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,018
Click selfies later.

97
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,684
Let's finish the work first.
Leave me.

98
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,388
The guests will be here any minute.

99
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,395
Leave me.

100
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,021
Him and his selfies

101
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,225
Anuj.

102
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,128
Give it to me.

103
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,401
Carefully.
- careful kids.

104
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,372
Here you go.

105
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,636
Thank you.

106
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,051
Choti...
- Yes, brother.

107
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,493
Pout... pout...

108
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,724
Brother...

109
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,496
I wonder when you'll get over...

110
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,537
...your habit of taking pictures?

111
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,403
And, why do you carn/
this stick even/where?

112
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,067
What's more, you upload
even] picture on social-sites.

113
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:29,705
That's why I have 4500 friends.

114
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,376
And, how else will they know...

115
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,645
...what this officer
is up to after retirement.

116
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:36,483
I see - One should
always stay updated.

117
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,318
Let me explain you.

118
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,218
With this selfie stick, we can...

119
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,658
Pout... pout...
- Put that away.

120
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:46,120
Call up the boy's father
and ask them how far they reached.

121
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,722
Or, we'll miss the auspicious
time for the engagement.

122
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,227
Turn this thing off.

123
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:50,694
Call them.

124
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,405
Greetings...

125
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:56,736
Jagaavar speaking.

126
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,437
How far have you guys reached?

127
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,772
We're not coming.

128
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:04,272
What? - We don't want
this alliance anymore.

129
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,479
What are you saying?

130
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,421
We...

131
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,422
We're waiting for you.

132
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,392
Don't act so naive, Mr. Chaudhanj.

133
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,491
Don't you know what happened?

134
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:24,028
What happened?
- I said...this engagement is canceled.

135
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:24,727
He||o...?

136
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,714
I said...this engagement is canceled.

137
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:44,777
Listen...

138
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:46,718
Listen...

139
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,522
What happened?

140
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,219
What did they say?

141
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,058
What's wrong, brother?

142
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,426
Any problem?
- It's nothing.

143
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,433
Just bad connection.
- Call them again.

144
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,490
Yeah...

145
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,802
It was just bad connection...

146
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,367
I was really scared...

147
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,497
Sister-in-Iaw, you are too much...

148
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,232
Did it get connected, brother?
- No.

149
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,042
Choti...

150
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,419
You're looking really gorgeous.

151
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,582
Thank you, brother.

152
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,360
Look... You guys handle things here.

153
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,725
I'll be right back.

154
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:28,788
Alright, brother.

155
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:30,598
Listen...

156
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,534
Where did he go all of a sudden?

157
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,263
I hope there's no problem, Anuj.

158
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:36,034
Don't worn], sister-in-Iaw.

159
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,267
I'll take a look.

160
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,483
Oh, sir...

161
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,450
You're driving like a grandpa...

162
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:52,251
Drive like a young man.
- No, madam.

163
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,620
The school is 5 kilometers away.

164
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,284
We'll be there in 10 minutes.

165
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:58,454
I am driving at 30 km/hr.

166
00:11:58,518 --> 00:11:59,622
Oh please!

167
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:03,190
I mean, if you drive at 60 km/hr...

168
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:06,430
...then we'll reach school in 5 minutes.
- No, madam.

169
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,129
The road is bad.

170
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:11,004
What if you get a jerk and fall down.

171
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,068
Doesn't matter how many potholes
are on the road, I won't fall down.

172
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,248
Why? - Because I will
hold you tight. - Madam...

173
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,053
Aastha madam, are you okay?

174
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,418
I am okay, sir.

175
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,321
Are you okay?
- Yes...

176
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:31,023
Sir, potatoes for lunch again?

177
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:34,521
You missed your bus again?

178
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,030
Why would I bring potatoes
for lunch even] day?

179
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:40,436
This is yesterday's leftover.

180
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,540
Why? Did you and sister
have a fight again...

181
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,542
...and she left you again?

182
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,668
Good...

183
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,679
I mean, not good.

184
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:56,344
Sir, you must be feeling lonely
without sister.

185
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:59,583
Sir, as long as sister
doesn't come back...

186
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:00,818
Can I come over?

187
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,685
I mean, to cook food.

188
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:05,127
I'll keep the door open when I cook.

189
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,994
And, your neighbors
won't get suspicious either.

190
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,624
My neighbors will get suspicious.

191
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,396
Ifthey were so sman,

192
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,494
wouldn't they be
teaching at school too?

193
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,037
That's not true.

194
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,630
These days a lot of stupid people

195
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,733
become teachers.

196
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,541
Aastha madam.
- Yes.

197
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,740
Don't think so negative
about yourself.

198
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,710
You're quite smart

199
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,713
Shall we?
- Yes.

200
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,019
Coming...

201
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,614
Who the hell is it?
Irritating me in the morning.

202
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,626
Hello, sir.
- Hello.

203
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:39,095
Is Sumer in?
- Sumer?

204
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,461
That's Sumer Punya.

205
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:42,556
That's me.

206
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,067
What do you want?

207
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,666
What is this uncivilized behavior?

208
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,509
Idiot...

209
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,642
You guys take credit card...

210
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:56,612
...|ike Santa's
handing out free gifts.

211
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,149
But...what happens when its
time to pay the installments?

212
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,048
You took less than a minute
to collect your card.

213
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,653
Why don't you answer my calls?

214
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,655
Somethings wrong with my phone.

215
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:05,553
Doesn't ring...

216
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,285
That's why I don't answer your calls.
- Ohh I see.

217
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,165
Sometimes it rings...

218
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,426
Idiot...

219
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,024
Lying to the recoven/ guy.

220
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,628
Turn it off.

221
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,433
Turn the phone off.

222
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,130
Now, pay up.
- But, I don't have money.

223
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,074
Why you...
- How about check instead?

224
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:29,238
Boss isn't playing chess
that you'll give him ‘check’!

225
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:33,608
‘Boss don't spon on duty.’
- What?

226
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:34,678
Look here...

227
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,379
Your checks are made of rubber.

228
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,149
Always bounces in the bank.

229
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,315
Pay cash...

230
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,256
Cash.
- But, listen to me...

231
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,351
You bloody... Switch offthe phone!

232
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,418
Stop calling me!

233
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,095
Yes sir.

234
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,429
Remember, when I am talking...

235
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,797
all phones should be in silent mode.

236
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,035
Understood...

237
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,571
Ifthe phone rings,
you don't have to answer it.

238
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:58,700
"Arjun...pick the phone."

239
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:02,303
"|'m missing you baby,
that's why I called."

240
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:05,679
"You're my ice-cream,
and I'm your cone."

241
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,612
What's up, baby?
- Arjun, where are you?

242
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,313
Out making a recovenj.

243
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,583
Slapping someone silly.

244
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,591
Ohh...a|right.

245
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:17,160
You know what, you can
stay busy with your recoveries...

246
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,661
...whi|e I'll get married
to someone else.

247
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,062
And then, you call me
sister-in-Iaw instead of baby.

248
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,531
You were supposed to come over today.

249
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,692
Don't get furious.

250
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,736
I'll be over there in 10 minutes.

251
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:28,063
I'm almost there.
- Really?

252
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,466
Really.

253
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,032
I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

254
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,702
I love you.

255
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,272
Sister-in-Iaw...

256
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,716
Stop grinning and pay up.

257
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:49,016
Children todays subject on Volcano.

258
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,021
There are three types of volcanoes.

259
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,495
Active Volcano.

260
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,559
Inactive Volcano.

261
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,465
And, Dormant Volcano.

262
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,060
Now watch, teacher will forget.

263
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,696
Most volcanoes...

264
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,034
Most volcanoes...

265
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,539
Hold on.

266
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,506
See, didn't I tell you?

267
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,642
Yeah... Japan.

268
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:15,450
Most volcanoes are found in...

269
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:16,748
Look teacher will always forget.

270
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,647
What's going on there?
- Yes buddy.

271
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,182
Vijay, where is Japan?

272
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,117
Don't know, teacher.

273
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,322
Stand up on the bench.

274
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,490
I still can't see it, sir.

275
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:32,434
Kneel down.
- Will I see it then?

276
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,303
You're such a dimwit.

277
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,439
Come here...

278
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,444
Now kneel down.

279
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:47,717
So, children, I've written some
propenies of volcanoes on this side.

280
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,213
Read these out loud.

281
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,514
Okay.

282
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:59,422
There's always lava oozing
out of an active volcano.

283
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,998
Vijay. What are you doing?

284
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,728
It is ven/ dangerous.

285
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:08,102
Soorajmukhi.
- Volcano.

286
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,504
Soorajmukhi.

287
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,614
You three are back so
soon from your parents home.

288
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,673
There are three types.

289
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,309
I'm here only to leave you again.

290
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,114
Understood?

291
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,620
This is my school.
What are you saying?

292
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:26,520
They can explode at any time.

293
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:28,990
I have come here to tell you that...

294
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,759
I am divorcing you.

295
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:32,155
Blast.

296
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:36,264
Divorce?
- Soorajmukhi, what happened?

297
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,160
You were so calm when you left.

298
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,398
My lawyer will answer your
questions now. Understood?

299
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:44,340
Lawyer? But what's wrong?

300
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,604
I see...you don't know what's wrong?

301
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:51,513
|...|...|...
- Stop bickering.

302
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,345
And...here are your daughters.

303
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,318
And their luggage.

304
00:17:56,542 --> 00:18:00,581
Now, you can say whatever
you want...in court

305
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:01,985
No.

306
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:03,983
Soorajmukhi!

307
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:04,721
Sooraj!

308
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,019
Listen...

309
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,224
Su...

310
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:12,992
Was that sister?

311
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,003
And she left so soon?

312
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:18,100
I'll send dinner
for you in the evening.

313
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,746
We really like Riya a lot.

314
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:27,575
It's a ‘yes’ from us.

315
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,416
Your son is a gem too.

316
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,987
Grandma.

317
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,215
He's such a charmer.

318
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,516
We like him too.

319
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,062
As soon as Pappu arrives,
we'll fix a wedding date.

320
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,061
The younger brother takes
all the decision in their family.

321
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,724
Little brother is
whole and sole... huh!

322
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,764
Look, Pappu's here.

323
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:49,206
I apologize for the delay.

324
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:50,707
That's the father.

325
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,460
We were all waiting for you.

326
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,655
We accept this proposal.
- But, I don't.

327
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,230
Pappu...
- I don't accept this proposal!

328
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,997
What are you saying?
- I am absolutely right.

329
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:26,009
You don't know anything, mother!

330
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:31,014
I'll get my daughter married to some
drunkard, glutton, even a thief...

331
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,984
But not him. - Uncle, I know someone
who matches all those qualities.

332
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,582
Our friend Ghanshyam.

333
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,485
He has all these qualities.

334
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,523
Pappu, have you lost your mind?

335
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,027
He such a nice boy...

336
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,687
Why are you being a spoil-sped?

337
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,025
You don't know mother.

338
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,358
I cannot ruin my daughter's life.

339
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:50,560
Bui, Papa-

340
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,735
Mr. Bhudev...|ook here.

341
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,129
Listen..

342
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,431
This marriage is out ofthe question.

343
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,498
Please forgive me.

344
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:00,407
But why?

345
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,273
How can you just reject this
marriage proposal? I love Riya.

346
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:06,340
A true |over...never do what you did.

347
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,076
But what did he do?

348
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,447
Please take him away, Bhudev.

349
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,077
And please tell him,

350
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,089
Ifl catch him around
my daughter again...

351
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,056
...then, I'll make sure he isn't
wonhy of doing anything again.

352
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:17,617
And, don't keep your hopes up either.
- Dharamchand.

353
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:22,661
Will you leave or should I?
- Pappu.

354
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:26,667
I just wanted to know what is wrong.

355
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:28,128
Say something.

356
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:29,672
Ask...

357
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:31,531
Ask your son what's wrong?

358
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:32,735
Arjun.

359
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:37,443
Now get out.
- Shall we...

360
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,378
Or would you like to get shot?

361
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:42,709
Pappu, tell me what's wrong.

362
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,220
I can't tell you, mom.

363
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,380
This is really embarrassing.

364
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,323
I don't approve ofthis marriage, that's all.
- Arjun.

365
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:52,626
Mr. Kulbhushan,
at least tell me what's wrong.

366
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,562
There's nothing left to say.

367
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,260
You see,
we can't ruin our reputation...

368
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,064
...by letting Sunil get
engaged to your sister.

369
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:00,800
What will the people say?

370
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:02,706
"That we chose such a family."

371
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,004
What are you saying?

372
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:08,502
Even/one knows that
we're decent people.

373
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,043
Decent...

374
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:19,322
Decent people never
taint their family honor.

375
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,350
And, don't tn/ to act so naive.

376
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:25,061
Posters of your decency
are all over the city.

377
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,358
Posters?

378
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,790
What are you saying?

379
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:36,130
You know...if I've made a mistake...

380
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,601
...then please forgive me.

381
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,166
Didn't you hear what brother said?

382
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,479
Don't you understand?

383
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,640
Go find someone else
for your sister...

384
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:48,344
...who likes tarnishing
their reputation. - Mind it...

385
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,238
Sir...

386
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:21,483
I... I beg...
- No-no...

387
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:23,743
Please, you don't
have to beg or plead.

388
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:27,353
Use this turban to cover your face,
and leave.

389
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,290
If someone sees you,
our reputation will be at stake too.

390
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:37,459
And yes,
don't ever come back here again.

391
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,265
Leave...

392
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:42,397
I said leave.

393
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,684
They rejected the marriage proposal.

394
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,392
Here you go, boss.
- Rejected? How can they do that?

395
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:07,089
They don't even tell
me what is the problem.

396
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:10,532
But you must have asked?
- "Arjun..."

397
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,262
Yeah, baby.
- Arjun, this is enough.

398
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,630
I've decided to leave this house.

399
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,376
Where will you go then?
- What do you mean where?

400
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,104
I am coming to you.

401
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,113
Meet me at Chaubey's shop.
- Coming...Coming...

402
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,271
"Respected Principal sir..."

403
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,248
"This is my humble request..."

404
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:29,081
"Due to some indispensable reasons..."

405
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,779
"...| am facing some grave problems."

406
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:33,319
<i>"|'||</i> find a quick solution
to it and return tonight."

407
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:35,359
"Please grant me half a day's |eave."

408
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,586
"Yours, dormant volcano...

409
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,128
Vinay Sharma."

410
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,737
I don't accept this proposal!

411
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,245
A true |over...never do what you did.

412
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:57,606
Arjun...

413
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:00,274
I think that your
father-in-Iaw was crazy.

414
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,216
He isn't saying yes,
nor is he telling is why.

415
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,378
What is the problem?

416
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,115
In English, he's a fool.

417
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,317
Technically speaking, you
shou|d've eloped with sister-in-Iaw.

418
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:10,585
But, sister-in-Iaws
eloping with you instead.

419
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,319
That's because she loves me a lot.

420
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,523
She can't live without me.

421
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:16,430
She can fend against
entire world for me.

422
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,024
But she didn't defend
you in front of her father.

423
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,194
‘He's not fighting.’

424
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:20,168
Shut up.

425
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,430
Not another word against
Riya or her love...

426
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,064
Or else I will settle
your installments.

427
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,130
I just telling truth.

428
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:28,644
"Arjun, pick the phone."

429
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:31,238
"|'m missing baby..."
- Hold this.

430
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,646
Your sister-in-Iaw is calling.

431
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:35,686
Now hear yourself
how much she loves me.

432
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,520
When are you getting here, baby?
- Baby...

433
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,080
To hell with baby...

434
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,490
"l will settle your installments."

435
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,551
You just come in front
of me, then I'll show you.

436
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,221
I will not spare you!

437
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:48,424
What's wrong, baby?

438
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,330
Why are you getting so furious?

439
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,164
Arjun, what have you done?

440
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,532
Didn't you feel ashamed at all?

441
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,469
Will you tell me what I did?
- Listen...

442
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,116
What's wrong, boss?

443
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,277
Is sister-in-Iaw not coming?

444
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,581
Not coming. Not running.

445
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:15,258
What happened, brother?
- What happened, brother?

446
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:21,397
Vinay, on your way to drop
the kids at sister-in-Iaws place?

447
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:22,693
Did she leave you again?

448
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:27,500
Take my advice and buy a pass instead.

449
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,663
It will be cheaper.

450
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:31,571
Stop your yapping...and
give me my ticket!

451
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,665
Brother slowly brother.

452
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,039
Brother, for sister-in-Iaws sake.

453
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:34,668
Give me an answer.

454
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,371
What's wrong, son?

455
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:38,244
Did your wife leave you?

456
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,578
Any Problem?

457
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,584
Is it STD?

458
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,717
Doesn't matter how
big the problem is...

459
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,522
...but anger is not good for health!

460
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:55,158
Unc|e...my grandpa died
at the age of 105.

461
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,096
Isee...

462
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:58,396
Was he shod-tempered too?
- No!

463
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:00,630
He would mind his own business.

464
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,969
Brother, the bus is coming.

465
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,566
Let it pass.

466
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:08,703
It will run over us, brother...
let it pass.

467
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,270
Go from this side.

468
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:11,246
Let it pass.

469
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:12,680
Let it pass, boss.

470
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,056
<i>Oh, WW»-</i>

471
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:21,086
Brother..

472
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,749
I'll show you.

473
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,050
Stop...

474
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:26,518
Stop...

475
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,529
Stop...

476
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,532
Stop on the side.

477
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:34,527
I said stop...stop...

478
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,197
Stop right there...

479
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,706
Stop right there...

480
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,504
Hey stop!

481
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,648
Carefully.

482
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,413
What's wrong?
You want to go in the bus?

483
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:49,384
Stop...brother is going to drive.

484
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,749
You get the jeep.

485
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,486
Ohh brother what's...

486
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:04,462
"A true lover...
never do what you did."

487
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:07,502
Arjun, what have done?

488
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:09,297
Didn't you feel ashamed at all?

489
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,441
What happened?

490
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:17,276
Why did you park the car
in front ofthe bus?

491
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,011
What's wrong?

492
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:21,051
Why did you stop the bus?

493
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,449
Just shut up you idiot.

494
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:29,014
Brother Vinay, come quickly.

495
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:30,516
I'll be right back.

496
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:32,152
Stay right here, children.

497
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,559
Excuse me.

498
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,327
What's wrong?

499
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,068
He is same.

500
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,438
"You don't know what's wrong?"

501
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,308
"| am divorcing you."

502
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:54,074
"We'll talk once I get home."

503
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,088
Stop.

504
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:04,983
What was I asking son?
The problem is right in front of us.

505
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,329
"Posters of your decency
are all over the city."

506
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:19,634
"Decent people never
taint their family honor."

507
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:31,087
"Vasectomy without operation."

508
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:33,382
"We got it done...

509
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:34,651
Will you do it too."

510
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,421
‘What's my picture
doing on this poster?’

511
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:40,157
"We'll nip the
population in the bud...

512
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,265
And no decrease in power."

513
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,164
‘When did I get this picture taken?’

514
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:45,627
"Get operated...

515
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,068
And get paid too."

516
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,536
This picture...

517
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:05,422
Brother...you look amazing.

518
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,582
I swear...|ooks fantastic.

519
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:10,991
Brother,
you know Murari is illiterate.

520
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,528
Come, I'll explain you.

521
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:17,226
I see, Vinay...this is
why your wife left you.

522
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,731
Tell me something...

523
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,495
You two look healthy...

524
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:24,973
Why did you involve him too?
- Hey! Mind it.

525
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,670
They've severed their connection!

526
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:30,475
Defanged the snake!

527
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:35,048
I wouldn't do it
for any amount of money.

528
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,184
And how cheeky ofthem...

529
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,689
All three models are
here promoting their product.

530
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,754
Get of... get of.

531
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:47,088
This is wrong, brother.

532
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:48,723
We grew up together...

533
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,330
We did even/thing together.

534
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:52,232
But, you got this done alone.

535
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:54,769
I wouldn't have got it done.

536
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:56,165
But, you cou|d've told me.

537
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:57,605
Aren't we friends. Tell me.

538
00:29:57,663 --> 00:29:59,199
I felt offended.

539
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,167
Don't just stand there...

540
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,178
Tear up that poster!

541
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:04,475
You...

542
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:07,374
What's the point of
tearing off the poster?

543
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:10,181
You shouldn't have
done it in the first place.

544
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,384
Take it off.

545
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:15,118
Take it off.

546
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:17,493
Mummy.

547
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,791
Who cou|d've published this?

548
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,569
Chaudhan/ sir,
I am sure it's this teacher's doing.

549
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:28,536
What?

550
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,569
But, you shouldn't
have dragged me in this.

551
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:31,766
I dragged you in this?
- Yes...

552
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,338
Me?
- Yes, of course.

553
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:34,741
I didn't publish anyone's picture...

554
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,677
...and, I didn't get
a vasectomy done either.

555
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,240
Soorajmukhi wants a son.

556
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:40,549
Why would I get such a thing done?

557
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,444
This is your doing?

558
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,347
My doing?

559
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:45,752
Have you lost your mind, teacher?

560
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:47,053
You have children...

561
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:48,284
Even Chaudhan/ sir has children.

562
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,553
I am still a bachelor.

563
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,116
Why would I go for a vasectomy?

564
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,163
My marriage got cancelled
because of this.

565
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:56,323
My wife wants to divorce me.

566
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:57,766
Why would I get it done?

567
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,424
This is your doing.

568
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:01,334
You didn't get a vasectomy done.

569
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,064
I didn't get a vasectomy done.

570
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:04,300
Then who's left?

571
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:13,481
What?

572
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,777
No...you can never get one done.

573
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,282
Teacher,
I am sure you've a hand in this.

574
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,220
I will settle your installment.

575
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,280
You'll settle my installment, huh?
- Yeah...

576
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,348
Mine?
- Yeah...

577
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:24,519
How will you do it?

578
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:28,053
I didn't take a bank
loan or a credit card...

579
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:31,759
...then, how will you
settle my installment?

580
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:33,128
How?

581
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,032
I mean I won't spare you.

582
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,300
Just a minute...

583
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:40,744
Teacher,
I won't spare you.

584
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:42,535
Hey you...

585
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:49,141
My sister's engagement got cancelled
and you guys are fighting?

586
00:31:58,183 --> 00:31:59,662
What are you two doing on the ground?

587
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,197
<i>'</i> Teacher...’

588
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,258
Teacher I won't spare you.

589
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,137
Forgive me...

590
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,475
Forgive me, teacher!

591
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:19,482
Chaudhan/ sir, If you stop
us from fighting like this...

592
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:21,176
...then, we'll soon leave this world.

593
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:24,277
Brother, we would've settled
this amongst ourselves.

594
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,150
Exactly.

595
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,154
Look...

596
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:29,292
We three are in trouble
because of this poster.

597
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:30,189
Right?

598
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,757
And we...

599
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:36,289
Where is he going?

600
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:38,463
What happened?

601
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,696
Ministn/ of Health and Welfare.

602
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,205
District Health Centre, Dhansar.

603
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:46,373
This is where we can
find out who made this mess.

604
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,035
Why you...

605
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,374
Speak UP

606
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,781
You're making posters
of our brother...

607
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:54,415
...and distributing it all
over the village. You fool...

608
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,077
Speak up... say sorn].

609
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:56,744
Wait...

610
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,722
You just ruined our brother's
life which was already hell.

611
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:06,195
Wasn't he insulted enough,
that you're insulting him more?

612
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:07,286
Wait...

613
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,759
Are you guys insulting him or me?

614
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:11,001
Even/one is insulting you...

615
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:12,558
...but, we're insulting
this bloody low life idiot.

616
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:15,070
How dare you publish these posters?

617
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:16,127
Leave him. Leave him.

618
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,696
Let him go.
- Chaudhan/ sir...you just tell me where.

619
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:18,639
I'll leave him personally.

620
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,005
I said leave him!

621
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,076
Leave him.

622
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,245
Leave him.

623
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,617
Chaudhan/ sirjust saved you.

624
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:34,223
Sit...

625
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,190
Breathe. Breathe.

626
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:40,229
Glasses... fix your glasses.

627
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:41,787
Sir calm down sir.

628
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:47,028
Sanjana.
- Yes, sir.

629
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,229
Get some cold tea for them.

630
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,170
Tea cold...

631
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:54,210
I mean... tea and cold drinks.

632
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,139
And sir, for you?
- Sugar...

633
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:58,307
Get sugar for me.

634
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,111
Okay, I will get it.

635
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,149
One black coffee, please.

636
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,412
Get that too.

637
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:06,081
Actua||y...|'ve low sugar.

638
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:09,157
But there are many
problems in this office.

639
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,318
Yeah...

640
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,295
My job is only stamping papers.

641
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,160
Are you telling or asking?

642
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,223
You were saying...

643
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,529
...your pictures were published
on the poster without your consent.

644
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:21,627
Huh!

645
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:23,628
Can I see the poster?

646
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:25,299
Show him the poster.

647
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:26,398
I'll show you the poster.

648
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,704
Here you go...

649
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,171
Open your eyes.

650
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:32,277
This is absolutely wrong.
- Absolutely...

651
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,573
By the way, you two are looking good.

652
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,515
But, why did you take him?

653
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,485
You...

654
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:40,318
You can see that we two
are looking good, and we took him.

655
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,388
But, why can't you see that...

656
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:45,121
...our pictures are published
on this poster for a vasectomy?

657
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,094
Yeah...
- You're right.

658
00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:49,655
Someone's definitely made a mistake.
- Mistake?

659
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:55,228
My sister's engagement got
canceled because ofthis mistake.

660
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:58,570
We were humiliated all
over the village. - Yeah...

661
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,374
You must give a written apology
in even/ newspaper for this mistake.

662
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:03,412
Yes.

663
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:08,213
Look... once even/thing is cleared,
we'll apologize too.

664
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,115
He's willing to apologize.

665
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:13,281
And, you must remove our posters from
all the neighboring villages as well.

666
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:14,346
Yes.

667
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,090
Yes, we'll get rid ofthem.

668
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:18,754
And you must pay us
Rupees five lacs as compensation.

669
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:19,757
Five lacs?

670
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,699
Okay. . .we'|| pay.

671
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:27,394
Five lacs to him and him as well.

672
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:30,099
And rupees one lac each for us.
- Why you?

673
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:31,402
Arjun is like our brother.

674
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,501
The villagers doubt us too.

675
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:37,509
Fine...we will pay.

676
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:42,449
You see...this incident
occurred in Jangethi.

677
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:45,386
Jangethi comes under ourjurisdiction.

678
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:49,791
There's a health officer
called Balwant Chokan.

679
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:50,753
Remember that name.

680
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:54,223
So, meet up with Balwant
Chokan and he'll solve your problem.

681
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,728
And, if in case he can't
find a solution to your problem...

682
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:59,428
...and there are some hurdles,
then I am still here.

683
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,435
Yes...

684
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,269
Satisfied?

685
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:03,665
OK8V~

686
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:06,504
Fine...we'|| go meet Balwant.

687
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:08,340
But, if he doesn't
solve our problem...

688
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,970
...then, we'll pay you a visit again.

689
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:14,177
And then, I'll let these
three loose on you. - Yeah

690
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,513
Understand, Mongia!

691
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:20,986
And after that you won't need sugar.

692
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:26,562
Why? - Because I'll bun]
you in the sugarcane field.

693
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:29,292
Under Sugarcane field.

694
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:33,327
And yes, ifthis confusion
isn't cleared yet...

695
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:37,100
...then, I'll dip you in nitrate solution,
and mix you with potassium permanganate...

696
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:39,335
...and squeeze you in sulfur peroxide.

697
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:42,302
And I'll turn you into a solution...

698
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:47,473
Potassium permanut... Sulfer...
- What's he doing?

699
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:50,319
Just a minute...

700
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,320
What's he doing?

701
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,284
Yes.

702
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,052
Yes. Teacher. Teacher.

703
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:02,189
Are you threatening
him or dictating homework?

704
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:05,162
Brother, this is a chemical threat.
- Chemical.

705
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,668
I must be sure that
the formula is correct.

706
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:07,965
Chemical threat.
- Yes.

707
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:09,061
Let's go, teacher.

708
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:10,470
Talking nonsense.

709
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,974
Just say bye in English.

710
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:13,736
Chemical threat...

711
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:16,377
I will break your mouth.

712
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:22,048
Ohh, God. Control...

713
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,285
Sanjana...

714
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,552
Who says you lose
power after vasectomy?

715
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:47,304
Arjun.

716
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,304
Hail goddess.

717
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,703
Even after even/thing
that happened today...

718
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,374
...| called up Riya's father.

719
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:57,344
He said that you
got an operation done.

720
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:02,552
What operation?
- Leave it, mom.

721
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:08,397
But he was operated when he was a kid.
- In his childhood? When?

722
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:11,600
Remember when he
got huﬂ on his finger.

723
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,294
Don't you remember?

724
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:16,396
They put such a big
plaster on his finger.

725
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,371
It was hard to tell which
one was the little finger...

726
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:18,499
...and which one was the thumb.

727
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:20,406
That's when we got him operated.

728
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:23,477
But what has that operation
got to do with his wedding?

729
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:26,515
His finger was little back then.

730
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:27,643
But now...

731
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,048
Leave it.

732
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:31,610
You won't understand.

733
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:34,555
I will if you explain me.
- You won't.

734
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,290
At least give me a hint.
- Hint?

735
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,152
You won't understand.

736
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:44,658
His finger was small.

737
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,637
I wonder when the
power will be restored?

738
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,374
Stop cn/ing and tn/ to understand.

739
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:59,510
Understand what, son-in-law?

740
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:00,546
Understand what?

741
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:02,243
Who gave you this right?

742
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:03,251
Tell me.

743
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:04,412
What did she ask for?

744
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:06,080
Only a son.

745
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:08,049
But, you got rid ofthe only medium.

746
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,285
Does that mean you
will you'll go to couﬂ?

747
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:11,485
What will the people say?

748
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:14,359
Ohh...what are the
people going to say?

749
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:16,056
Didn't you think about them...

750
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,157
...when you killed
your future children?

751
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:20,035
Mom...

752
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:23,268
At school, he writes on
the blackboard with white chalk.

753
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:25,365
But look at my predicament...

754
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,205
He pushed my future in darkness.

755
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:30,413
And...he's out of chalk too now.

756
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:34,682
What have you given me?
- What are you saying, Soorajmukhi?

757
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:36,217
|...

758
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,680
Just a minute.

759
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,122
Yeah...

760
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,592
24-carat gold necklace...

761
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,228
7 Benarasi sarees...

762
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,354
1 diamond ring...

763
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,294
Silver anklets...

764
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:49,388
My home...

765
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:50,762
Two lovely daughters.

766
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:52,599
And... Where else have
I written the rest?

767
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:53,692
Enough!

768
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,294
You've written even/thing.

769
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:58,372
You've maintained an
account of even/thing neatly.

770
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:02,434
But...| don't think you
know that men run the world.

771
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,444
Tell me something...

772
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:04,479
Tell me...

773
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,446
I gave you two daughters.

774
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,381
Didn't I?
- Yes, you did.

775
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:11,420
So, ifl asked you for a son...

776
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:13,387
Then what is my mistake?

777
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:15,652
What age are you living in,
Soorajmukhi?

778
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,584
These days...there is no difference
between girls and boys.

779
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,128
Please explain her.

780
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:21,687
Isee...

781
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:22,731
So you're going to explain me...

782
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,528
...that there is no difference
between boys and girls.

783
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:26,498
No difference, huh?

784
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:28,402
They why did you marn/ a girl?

785
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,095
You shou|d've married a boy instead.

786
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,072
It's pointless to talk to you.

787
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:36,241
What is she made of?

788
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:37,512
Soorajmukhi...

789
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:39,475
Soorajmukhi...

790
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,313
P|ease...ca|m down.

791
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,281
I'm here to take you back home.

792
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:47,186
Let's go.

793
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,590
'| telled you... I no go...’

794
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:54,761
You call that home...

795
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,790
...where I there's a cold
brick instead of a husband.

796
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:01,102
Soorajmukhi...

797
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,366
That's no way to talk
in front of your parents.

798
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:04,565
Hear that...

799
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:06,007
Did you hear that?

800
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,267
Now I can't speak...

801
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:08,504
I can't open my mouth.

802
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:09,476
And you?

803
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,440
You just announced
to the entire world...

804
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:16,349
...and put up huge posters
even/where of your vasectomy.

805
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,011
What about that?

806
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,444
I know it...

807
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:21,090
You like your daughters...

808
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:22,487
...that's why you got
yourself sterilized.

809
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:24,356
I didn't get sterilized!

810
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,330
See, I was telling the truth...

811
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:30,264
...that's why power was restored.
- You see...

812
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:33,695
This power will come and go.

813
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,196
But you...

814
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:38,567
You just blew-up your transformer!

815
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,517
Come in, I'll tell you even/thing.

816
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:00,585
Is it true?

817
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:04,460
What?

818
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:09,569
What have you done?

819
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:12,430
You shou|d've thought about
what the people are going to say.

820
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:13,702
If he had thought about that,
sister-in-Iaw...

821
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:15,267
...then, he would've never
opted for a vasectomy!

822
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:18,278
You didn't even think
that we're Chaudhanj.

823
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,672
I haven't done anything
like you think.

824
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:23,742
Even if you got it done,
why tell the world about it?

825
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,749
You didn't care for
our family reputation...

826
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:27,681
...you cou|d've at least
thought about your sister.

827
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,317
Today was her engagement!

828
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:31,154
It's all over now.
Even/thing's finished.

829
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:34,029
Posing there like a model.

830
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:35,359
This poster is a fake.

831
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:37,096
This is a lie...

832
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:38,259
I didn't do anything.

833
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:41,327
These are official posters?
- So what?

834
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,769
Does the government
have an enmity with you?

835
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,472
Why will they publish your photo?

836
00:42:44,529 --> 00:42:46,065
You're mistaken.

837
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,335
Even if it's true...

838
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,206
what is Anja|i's fault?

839
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:52,339
She's your sister.

840
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:53,675
That's her fault.

841
00:42:54,372 --> 00:42:57,649
I told you a dozen times
to stop clicking pictures.

842
00:42:57,709 --> 00:42:58,585
But no...

843
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:00,452
Now see what it has gotten us into.

844
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:05,357
Who would want to marn/
anyone from such a family?

845
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,123
Even/one's laughing at us.

846
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:09,362
Brother, Mr. Kulbhushan is right!

847
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,589
In fact,
I would've done the same thing.

848
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:14,669
listen...

849
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,038
Listen...

850
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,406
Listen up...

851
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:26,709
Choti...

852
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:36,748
Choti...ifthis is my fault,
then I'll fix even/thing.

853
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:41,527
Just watch,
you'll get married to Sunil.

854
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:44,199
I trust you, brother.

855
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,659
You've always been my Superman.

856
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:49,067
Superman can never do anything wrong.

857
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:07,746
Sir...

858
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:09,719
Sir, I've locked the gate.

859
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,688
That's not going to help.

860
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:14,696
I say lock all the doors and windows.

861
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,732
Sanjana madam just called.

862
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:19,298
She was saying that
they are dangerous people.

863
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:22,031
I've handled
even/thing...you don't worn].

864
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:23,333
Don't worn]...

865
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:25,601
With whose permission
did you publish these posters?

866
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,040
You...

867
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:30,110
You asked me to use
pictures of real men.

868
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:31,269
For an impact.

869
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,609
Forget the impact...

870
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,705
Tell me something...

871
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:36,718
...cou|dn't you use
pictures of other people?

872
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:37,616
What could I do?

873
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:39,644
The minister was visiting in 4 days...

874
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:41,213
Posters weren't ready.

875
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:44,653
So, I published whatever
pictures I could find.

876
00:44:44,716 --> 00:44:46,252
Published them?

877
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:49,161
Now |isten...what's done is done.
- Done.

878
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:53,430
Put a hold on the next lot.
- Okay...

879
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,470
I can't.
- Why?

880
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,733
I dispatched that lot last night.

881
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:03,109
Silly boy...you'|| get me killed.

882
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,145
No.

883
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,614
You cou|d've paid some
guys from another village...

884
00:45:06,671 --> 00:45:08,446
...and get their picture taken.

885
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:09,676
Did you pay me?

886
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:13,488
You've already gobbled the
money you got for the pictures.

887
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,114
I wonder where do
you adjust all of it.

888
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:16,180
Balwant...

889
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:17,485
Ba|want...come out...

890
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,720
Who is Balwant come out

891
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:20,189
Balwant...

892
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:21,730
Your name is Balwant.
- Balwant is dead.

893
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:22,657
Balwant...

894
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,562
Balwant...

895
00:45:23,621 --> 00:45:24,759
They are calling you, Balwant.

896
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:25,625
Go.

897
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,067
Go on... Go...

898
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:27,626
I am right here.

899
00:45:27,692 --> 00:45:28,727
Come along...
- Not me...

900
00:45:28,993 --> 00:45:29,664
Let's go together.

901
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,503
We'll live together, die together.

902
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,440
What... what...

903
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,406
Hold on. Hold on.

904
00:45:37,535 --> 00:45:40,175
Which one of you is Balwant Chokan?

905
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:42,006
You bloody...

906
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:47,782
I am Balwant...
- You are Balwant...

907
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:49,080
Wait...stop...

908
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,724
I am Balwant,
but sometimes he's Balwant too.

909
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:53,592
He's lying.
- Just a minute.

910
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,322
Mr. Balwant, open this gate.

911
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,398
We want to talk to you.

912
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:57,330
Yes...

913
00:45:57,388 --> 00:46:00,028
Look, we can't help you,
the office is closed today.

914
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:00,796
You...

915
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:02,463
He won't listen politely.

916
00:46:02,527 --> 00:46:03,335
Break the lock.

917
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:05,169
Break it. Break it.

918
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:07,266
Break it. Break it.

919
00:46:07,365 --> 00:46:09,072
Break it. Break it.

920
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:10,305
Don't you dare...

921
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:11,472
Hey"-

922
00:46:11,536 --> 00:46:12,981
Who breaks locks with a shoe?

923
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:16,246
Use your head.
- You're absolutely right, Chaudhan/ sir.

924
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:18,378
Oh my head!

925
00:46:18,743 --> 00:46:20,086
Move back, I'll break the lock.

926
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:21,248
Now watch my strength...

927
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:22,188
Look... Look...

928
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:23,691
Don't break anything...

929
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:25,193
...or else we'll call the police.

930
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:26,193
Balwant!

931
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:29,220
Don't threaten us.

932
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:33,298
We're being polite, you do the same.

933
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:35,564
So why reson to violence?

934
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,334
Absolutely right...we can be civilized...
- What civilized?

935
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:39,704
I'll settle your installments...

936
00:46:39,764 --> 00:46:40,708
You come here.

937
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:42,108
Hold on...

938
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:44,574
Civilized, huh?

939
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:47,644
I'll talk to you in a civilized way.

940
00:46:47,772 --> 00:46:49,479
Answer one simple question.

941
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,110
How dare you offend
our civic rights...

942
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:55,748
...and put up posters with
our pictures all over the city...

943
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:58,323
...promoting Sterilization.

944
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:04,496
What did we do on Friday?

945
00:47:04,622 --> 00:47:08,468
Sterilization... meaning vasectomy.

946
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:10,164
Vasec. . iomy?

947
00:47:11,262 --> 00:47:12,536
We don't get it.

948
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:15,336
Tomy...you speak,
at least we'll understand.

949
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:19,347
How dare you call him Tomy?
- You called me Tomy.

950
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:22,116
Wait a minute...

951
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:25,711
He's saying why you
published our picture...

952
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:27,613
...on the vasectomy posters?

953
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,622
Yes.

954
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,648
You're a government officer.

955
00:47:30,715 --> 00:47:32,991
Does this suit you?
- No...

956
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:34,390
This is your fault.

957
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:38,992
So you'll give a written apology
in all the newspapers tomorrow.

958
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:39,557
We will.

959
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:44,664
And get rid of all the posters
you put up in the village. - Yeah...

960
00:47:45,263 --> 00:47:49,336
Yes... ifthis is our fault,
we're ready to do it.

961
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,142
And as compensation...
- You must give Rupees 15 lacs.

962
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:54,310
Yeah...
- Rupees 15 lacs.

963
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,416
Yeah...

964
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,621
Rupees 15 lacs to him...and
Rupees 15 lacs to him too.

965
00:48:00,678 --> 00:48:02,282
And rupees <i>2</i> lacs to us.
- In cash.

966
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:04,348
Listen...these are legal matters.

967
00:48:04,415 --> 00:48:06,520
Legal matters always take time.

968
00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:10,430
You know what, give us 3-4 years...
- Hey...

969
00:48:12,523 --> 00:48:14,366
3-4 months...
- Hey...

970
00:48:16,027 --> 00:48:17,233
Fine, 10-12 days.

971
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:18,171
Okay?

972
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:19,606
Give us 10-12 days.

973
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:22,270
I'll conduct an inquin/
on a personal level.

974
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:25,280
And, we'll call you
after we catch the culprit.

975
00:48:25,336 --> 00:48:27,179
You must come here
on the date we call you.

976
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:30,048
And on that date, we'll decide...

977
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:32,109
Date after date after date...

978
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:36,352
Balwant Rai you swine...
- Swine...Swine...Swine...

979
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,321
He's talking to you.

980
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,422
Balwant sir...

981
00:48:40,618 --> 00:48:42,564
We give you 12 days...

982
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:47,091
But, if you don't solve
this problem in 12 days...

983
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:49,061
...then, remember...

984
00:48:49,694 --> 00:48:53,073
On the 13th day will be your funeral.

985
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:54,665
Understood.

986
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,636
Chaudhan/ sir is absolutely right.

987
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,008
12 days means 12 days.

988
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,573
Otherwise, on the 13th day,
you'll be in the graveyard...

989
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:03,050
...and we'll be behind bars.

990
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:06,151
Yeah...you have 12 days.

991
00:49:06,377 --> 00:49:07,481
24 hours in a day.

992
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:08,580
60 minutes in an hour.

993
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:10,057
60 seconds in a minute.

994
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,950
So how many seconds in 12 days?

995
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:15,428
How many?

996
00:49:16,187 --> 00:49:16,995
12 days...

997
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,158
8 into 40...

998
00:49:18,222 --> 00:49:20,668
No, no, no, 60 into 40

999
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:22,731
Just a minute...

1000
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:31,041
Teacher... you've made it clear,
didn't you?

1001
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:33,082
Let him do the math.

1002
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:36,080
You can do the calculation,
can't you?

1003
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:40,147
Brother, it's a mathematical threat.

1004
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:42,188
I must be sure.

1005
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:43,088
Mathematical threat.

1006
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:44,125
Teacher is crazy.

1007
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:45,159
He got it.

1008
00:49:45,216 --> 00:49:46,024
He'll do it.

1009
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,061
Let's go.

1010
00:49:47,118 --> 00:49:49,325
Don't forget,
we'll be back.

1011
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:51,388
Go on...

1012
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:54,228
One more thing...

1013
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:00,132
The lock won't open.

1014
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:09,148
We'll get it done in 12 days.

1015
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,341
Really.

1016
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:17,123
Chaudhan/ sir...

1017
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:20,261
If only I had got my hands on him,
I would've torn him up.

1018
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:24,197
If you like tearing things up,
then go out at night...

1019
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:27,236
...and tear up all our
posters in the village.

1020
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:35,708
Teacher, shall we tear you up...
or shred you to pieces...

1021
00:50:38,102 --> 00:50:38,739
Arjun...

1022
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,674
Look at that stop-stop...

1023
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:41,512
Stop the car.

1024
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:43,346
What happened, Mr. Chaudhanj?

1025
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:44,647
Arjun...Arjun...Arjun...stop.

1026
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:46,047
Look at that.

1027
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,589
What the...

1028
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,454
What did Chaudhan/ sir remember
after seeing this picture?

1029
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,570
Where did I get this picture taken?

1030
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,604
What kind of a ringtone is that?

1031
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,036
Hello. - This is Kunwar Singh,
the Iaundn/man.

1032
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:13,378
I got rid ofthe stain on
your blue shin and stitched it up.

1033
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:14,677
Stitched it up? Why?

1034
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:17,144
I had to cut off
the stain with scissors.

1035
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:19,051
It will cost you extra Rupees 20.

1036
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:21,453
Hello! Hello!

1037
00:51:22,046 --> 00:51:23,024
He hung up.

1038
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:25,387
I got rid of his stain,
and he hung up on me.

1039
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:34,661
'| got rid ofthe stain on
your blue shin, and stitched it up.’

1040
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:44,778
I had this picture taken...
at the fair.

1041
00:51:45,036 --> 00:51:46,174
There was a stain here.

1042
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:48,239
So, I posed like this.

1043
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:59,083
Murari, the teacher is right.

1044
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:00,424
This picture taken at the fair.

1045
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,088
I wore that jacket at the fair.

1046
00:52:02,153 --> 00:52:03,029
Riya baby gave it to me.

1047
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:04,327
Yeah...

1048
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:12,564
Oh yes...even I got this
picture taken at the fair.

1049
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:17,044
So this means that photographer
made a mocken/ out of us.

1050
00:52:17,101 --> 00:52:18,045
Yeah...

1051
00:52:18,102 --> 00:52:21,208
Chaudhan/ sir,
I know this photographer.

1052
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:24,351
Suraj photographer. Nainsukh Studio.

1053
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:28,287
He charges a high fee
for a single picture. - I see...

1054
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:33,385
How much? - You see, my friend
had a picture taken <i>2</i> months ago.

1055
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,623
Since then he's asked
him for money 40-50 times.

1056
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:37,097
What are you saying?

1057
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,132
Bloody...

1058
00:52:38,189 --> 00:52:39,759
Do you know where we can find him?

1059
00:52:40,024 --> 00:52:41,094
Of course, I do.

1060
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:44,435
Why did you print that poster?

1061
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:49,572
He can't speak...

1062
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:52,409
His connection is
severed with his voice.

1063
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:54,415
You mean this mobi|e's on silent mode?

1064
00:52:54,472 --> 00:52:55,610
Yes sir.

1065
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,584
His connection with
his voice is severed...

1066
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:00,315
...but, he put up posters
of our sterilization even/where.

1067
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:01,355
Yes.

1068
00:53:01,412 --> 00:53:03,585
No-no...he didn't print those posters.

1069
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:05,490
Then who did?

1070
00:53:05,983 --> 00:53:07,428
We had our pictures taken by him.

1071
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,277
Calm down and take a deep breath.

1072
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:25,439
In and out.

1073
00:53:30,341 --> 00:53:32,548
Now...te|| us from the beginning.

1074
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,354
I was born in 1970...

1075
00:53:37,448 --> 00:53:40,054
Mister, not that far back.

1076
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,591
Stan from the fair.
- Yeah..

1077
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:46,298
Sorn], I got carried away.

1078
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:50,737
At the fair, I took his picture,
I took his picture, I took his picture too.

1079
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:55,038
And, I put all those pictures...
and got busy playing cards.

1080
00:53:57,501 --> 00:53:58,536
Card... Card...

1081
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:02,448
I put all those pictures in a card,
and I that card...

1082
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,750
...and peed on it.

1083
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:05,543
What...

1084
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:06,451
How?

1085
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:08,349
You want to pee...

1086
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:09,049
Go on.

1087
00:54:09,146 --> 00:54:12,616
Go...
- No. I already did it, sir.

1088
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:15,329
Su... Su...

1089
00:54:15,386 --> 00:54:16,558
Su... Su...

1090
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:17,530
Su...Bo|..

1091
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:19,295
Su...Bo|...

1092
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:20,300
Subol...

1093
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:21,768
Bash... Su-bash

1094
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:22,537
Subash.

1095
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:25,005
Subash... Subash off...

1096
00:54:25,062 --> 00:54:26,632
Subash, the offset guy.

1097
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:34,339
I gave it to Subhaash,
the offset guy.

1098
00:54:34,405 --> 00:54:38,751
He created this mess,
I haven't done anything.

1099
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:41,512
Wash my hands... and back's clean.

1100
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,421
Subhaash Offset!

1101
00:54:43,714 --> 00:54:46,786
We'll ‘set’ that Subash straight
and turn him 'off' for good.

1102
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,028
Let's go.

1103
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:49,723
And bun] him in the centre...

1104
00:54:50,354 --> 00:54:53,767
Suraj, if you've lied to us...

1105
00:54:54,558 --> 00:54:56,333
...then, you will never
see the day again.

1106
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:04,346
Yes, when the sun sets...
- Teacher, you'll forget it.

1107
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:05,539
Let it be.
- But, brother...

1108
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:08,674
Tell me...
- I've written even/thing...

1109
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:10,741
Please hear it once.
- I did...| did...

1110
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:22,128
Balwant sir, Suraj speaking.

1111
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:27,126
Now listen to me carefully.
- Yes, Chaudhan/ sir.

1112
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:30,502
When we go inside,
we'll talk politely.

1113
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:32,438
No one will raise his voice.

1114
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,476
And no one will raise their hand.

1115
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:36,010
But, Chaudhan/ sir...

1116
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,310
Fine... okay...
- We won't.

1117
00:55:37,368 --> 00:55:38,779
Okay.
- Understood?

1118
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:40,208
We won't raise our hand,

1119
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:40,771
we'll be polite.

1120
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:41,709
Understood?
- Yes...

1121
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:44,309
We won't raise our hand,

1122
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,514
We'll be polite. Come on.

1123
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:47,783
Yes, this is absolutely right...
Absolutely right...

1124
00:55:48,212 --> 00:55:49,384
Brother Subhaash.

1125
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:50,288
Brother Subhaash.

1126
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,519
Yeah speak up.

1127
00:55:51,582 --> 00:55:57,760
Who told you to print
our pictures on the poster?

1128
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:02,163
Dozens of people come
here even/ day, mister.

1129
00:56:02,226 --> 00:56:03,671
I can't remember even/ face.

1130
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:06,664
I've things to do...move.

1131
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:09,371
Moolchand, load that truck now.

1132
00:56:14,572 --> 00:56:15,573
Brother Subhaash.

1133
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,510
Brother Subhaash.

1134
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:19,076
Please tell us, brother Subhaash...

1135
00:56:19,143 --> 00:56:26,357
...these posters are ruining our lives.
- So, what can I do?

1136
00:56:26,984 --> 00:56:29,396
I said I don't remember,
means I don't remember.

1137
00:56:29,453 --> 00:56:31,023
Don't you understand?

1138
00:56:31,155 --> 00:56:33,328
Moolchand,
check ifthe deliven/‘s done.

1139
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,631
Are you going to take another
35 years to finish this?

1140
00:56:35,693 --> 00:56:38,731
Please brother Subhaash,
just tell us his name.

1141
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:40,532
You won't listen politely.

1142
00:56:41,298 --> 00:56:43,369
I am telling you for the last
time that I don't remember his name.

1143
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:45,413
Your lives are getting ruined,
isn't it?

1144
00:56:45,469 --> 00:56:47,073
So stop wasting my time.

1145
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,014
My time is ven/ valuable...

1146
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,416
Don't ever come back here again.

1147
00:56:51,475 --> 00:56:54,046
Or else I'll have you thrown out...

1148
00:56:54,111 --> 00:56:56,022
Don't think I am some pushover.

1149
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,023
This is a threat!

1150
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,150
Nathu...

1151
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:05,557
How dare you toy around with us!

1152
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:08,125
I'll bash you up so hard,
that you'll bounce offthe ground...

1153
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,465
...and hit the ceiling!

1154
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:12,632
And your bones will turn to dust!

1155
00:57:12,696 --> 00:57:14,334
Your body will get shattered
in so many pieces, that...

1156
00:57:14,398 --> 00:57:16,002
...we'|| have to gather
it around with a broom!

1157
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:18,705
Tell us his name...

1158
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:21,313
Tell us his name...who
published our pictures.

1159
00:57:23,674 --> 00:57:25,585
What? What? What?

1160
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,747
Balwanfs assistant, Ravi.

1161
00:57:30,247 --> 00:57:32,750
Why didn't you tell us...before?

1162
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:33,651
Now, wait...

1163
00:57:33,717 --> 00:57:36,425
At least tell us what you're doing.

1164
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:40,295
forgive me...
now, please let me down

1165
00:57:40,524 --> 00:57:42,003
Pout...pout.
- What?

1166
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:43,766
Like this... pout...

1167
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,008
For evidence.

1168
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:52,578
Doesn't that look nice?

1169
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:54,081
Ven/ nice.

1170
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,181
Come on, let's go see Balwant...

1171
00:57:58,242 --> 00:57:59,243
Murari carefully.

1172
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:02,387
Stay away Murari, Careful.

1173
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,356
Salutations.

1174
00:58:11,021 --> 00:58:14,730
Brother,
you always advise us to be calm.

1175
00:58:15,192 --> 00:58:19,641
But, you... - I say that to myself,
not you guys.

1176
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:22,577
Be polite, be gentle.

1177
00:58:22,633 --> 00:58:25,739
Because, when I am furious,
I get out of control.

1178
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:27,607
And then the guy never gets up...

1179
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:28,672
...he goes up to heaven.

1180
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:35,112
You're right.

1181
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,021
You're right.
- I am right...

1182
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,617
You're right.

1183
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:42,687
Come on, let's take this evidence to Balwant.
- Let's go.

1184
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:53,167
Papa's back...papa's back.

1185
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:57,269
Papa...
- How did you two get here?

1186
00:58:57,334 --> 00:58:59,575
With mom.
- Mom?

1187
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:01,047
Yeah...

1188
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:05,414
Okay, go play.
- Careful.

1189
00:59:07,311 --> 00:59:09,382
Soorajmukhi, you're back.

1190
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:11,625
I am so haPPV-

1191
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:15,994
I thought you'll be
facing problems without me.

1192
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,500
That's why I am back
home to look after you.

1193
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:22,033
But, ifthere's anyone who
can look after you, then tell me now.

1194
00:59:22,092 --> 00:59:24,595
I'll go back.
- What are you saying, Soorajmukhi?

1195
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:27,005
Who will take care of me except you.

1196
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:31,376
Do you know my condition
when you leave?

1197
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:37,075
Like a small plant in the scorching
desen, which cannot bear the heat.

1198
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,480
Life has...

1199
00:59:41,111 --> 00:59:42,215
Life has...

1200
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:46,057
Life has...

1201
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:50,327
Just a minute.
- Forget it.

1202
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:55,667
When you've a honest head, you
don't need a book to prove anything.

1203
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:57,766
Understood, professor.

1204
00:59:58,028 --> 01:00:02,272
You know, Soorajmukhi,
I missed all of you so much...

1205
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:05,408
...that, I haven't eaten
anything for the last two days.

1206
01:00:06,136 --> 01:00:07,740
Really?
- Teacher.

1207
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:09,540
Here you go.

1208
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,120
Aastha madam has sent dinner for you.

1209
01:00:12,509 --> 01:00:13,749
Sister-in-Iaw.

1210
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:15,489
sister-in-Iaw, you're back.

1211
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:16,590
That's great...

1212
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,682
Now the teacher
won't need this food.

1213
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:21,320
Ifthe other lunchbox is empty,
can I take it back?

1214
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:24,525
Sister-in-Iaw,
are you planning on staying...

1215
01:00:24,588 --> 01:00:26,499
...or will you go back tomorrow.

1216
01:00:28,759 --> 01:00:30,705
Sister-in-Iaw, have you
tasted Aastha madam's cooking?

1217
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:32,763
No one can cook better
than Aastha madam.

1218
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:33,734
I can bet on it...

1219
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,572
Bottle-gourd,
eggplant, carrots, radish...

1220
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,475
She's the best cook
in the neighborhood.

1221
01:00:37,534 --> 01:00:40,276
And, the bottle-gourd
tastes really delicious.

1222
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:41,680
See for yourself...

1223
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:42,443
Ask the teacher yourself.

1224
01:00:42,506 --> 01:00:43,484
Isn't it, teacher.

1225
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:46,487
Sister-in-Iaw, someone else
eats the teacher's lunch at school.

1226
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:48,283
And, he eats Aastha madam's lunch.

1227
01:00:48,545 --> 01:00:51,048
Sister-in-Iaw, just taste Aastha
madam's cooking once.

1228
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:53,185
There's has magic in her hands.

1229
01:00:58,589 --> 01:01:03,129
"Like a small plant
in the scorching deseﬂ..."

1230
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,739
I will break your plant today!

1231
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,123
Soorajmukhi...

1232
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,640
Soorajmukhi, I am ven/ hungnj.

1233
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:43,040
If only you could cook something for me...
- Why?

1234
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:46,081
Go and eat from your lunchbox.

1235
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,316
You returned that as well.

1236
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:55,383
Isee...

1237
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:57,217
Otherwise, you would've eaten that?
- No

1238
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:02,024
I thought you will learn
your lesson when I am not here.

1239
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:03,229
But no...

1240
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:04,997
You're having a ball instead.

1241
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,227
People are sending you food.

1242
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:07,332
Great...

1243
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:10,695
But, how will you face her now?

1244
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:15,168
You're thinking about tying
the noose around your neck...

1245
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:17,075
...after setting the rope on fire.

1246
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:20,573
Arjun.
- What Arjun?

1247
01:02:20,637 --> 01:02:21,547
What happened?

1248
01:02:21,605 --> 01:02:23,175
Why call me so urgently?

1249
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,345
Did your father find
another suitor for you?

1250
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,679
Arjun...

1251
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:31,325
Arjun, we...

1252
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:34,561
We gave all the
evidence to Chokan sir.

1253
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:39,462
And he's assured us that
soon even/thing will be fine.

1254
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:49,437
I guess you don't trust me.

1255
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:50,807
How do I explain you?

1256
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:52,670
I didn't get any operation done.

1257
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:55,616
That man... he'll tell the truth.

1258
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:59,180
Look, just because I am back...

1259
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:03,424
...that doesn't mean that
I believe you completely.

1260
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:08,127
I haven't changed my
mind about divorcing you.

1261
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:13,126
All you should know...
is that you have few more months.

1262
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:15,669
Understood?
- Few months.

1263
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:17,002
Meaning?

1264
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,631
Is it true?
- Don't you believe me?

1265
01:03:19,696 --> 01:03:23,200
Arjun...
- Baby, I didn't mean that...

1266
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,507
I mean...is it really true?

1267
01:03:26,403 --> 01:03:27,541
Fine.

1268
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:32,152
Sorn]!

1269
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,421
Teacher...

1270
01:03:43,253 --> 01:03:44,197
Yeah, teacher?

1271
01:03:44,421 --> 01:03:45,422
Right now?

1272
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:51,204
That's Arjun.

1273
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:55,174
Yes, Chaudhan/ sir.
- Arjun, what are you doing here?

1274
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:57,268
Where's the teacher?
- He's the one who called me here.

1275
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,607
Hasn't he arrived yet?

1276
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:04,112
Chaudhan/ sir, one minute.

1277
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:09,983
You won't believe it.

1278
01:04:14,151 --> 01:04:15,095
What?

1279
01:04:15,752 --> 01:04:16,628
It's a night-dress.

1280
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:18,725
Don't you have one?

1281
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:21,029
Even I am wearing a nightdress...

1282
01:04:21,091 --> 01:04:23,435
But, I didn't borrow
my kid's night-dress.

1283
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:26,496
Forget that, Mr. Chaudhanj.

1284
01:04:26,563 --> 01:04:27,234
Listen to me...

1285
01:04:27,297 --> 01:04:29,641
I've found evidence of my innocence.
- I see...

1286
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,042
Me too...

1287
01:04:31,101 --> 01:04:33,741
There's delay, but not denial.

1288
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:40,511
Soorajmukhi is pregnant.
- Really, teacher.

1289
01:04:40,577 --> 01:04:42,750
Congratulations! Congratulations!

1290
01:04:43,013 --> 01:04:44,720
Congratulations! Congratulations!

1291
01:04:44,781 --> 01:04:47,762
Chaudhan/ sir, my baby's pregnant too.

1292
01:04:48,018 --> 01:04:49,088
What?

1293
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:56,335
See that, brother...before the wedding.
- Yes, I can see...

1294
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:57,531
Didn't you feel ashamed?

1295
01:04:57,694 --> 01:04:58,331
No.

1296
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:01,171
You cou|d've at least waited until you
two got married. - I was going to...

1297
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:02,232
Boys these days...

1298
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:04,300
I wonder what's wrong with them?

1299
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:07,208
Learn to respect women.

1300
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:12,413
Looking at women like this
before marriage is a sin.

1301
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:16,251
Look at me...
even after all these years...

1302
01:05:16,313 --> 01:05:20,125
...| never looked at any
woman except for Sunita.

1303
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:24,055
In fact,
I didn't even think about anyone.

1304
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:26,529
For me, there's Sunita...

1305
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:29,102
...and for Sunita,
there's just me.

1306
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:30,763
Wow...
- Did you hear?

1307
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:34,032
He was referring to you.
- I see...

1308
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:36,236
You sinner...

1309
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:38,401
Actually, I thought...

1310
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:40,403
Hello.

1311
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:41,448
Phone.

1312
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:43,478
Sheila is pregnant.

1313
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:48,353
Sheila is pregnant.
Sheila is pregnant.

1314
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:54,123
Chaudhan/ sir... huh...!
- Yeah, she's pregnant!

1315
01:06:01,191 --> 01:06:01,635
OK8V~

1316
01:06:02,225 --> 01:06:03,602
Take good care of Sheila.

1317
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:08,600
Chaudhan/ sir,
I thought you were retired...

1318
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:10,611
...but, you still
get the spunk in you.

1319
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:13,546
Brother, I had only heard the song...

1320
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:16,480
...but you actually
ruined Sheila's life.

1321
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:17,610
Shut up, teacher.

1322
01:06:17,674 --> 01:06:18,982
What are you guys saying?

1323
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:21,022
Sheila is the name of my buffalo.

1324
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:22,315
<i>Oh, WW»-</i>

1325
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:23,186
A buffalo.

1326
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,182
That's really convenient,
Chaudhan/ sir.

1327
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:27,588
Instead of arguing with sister-in-Iaw,
Buffalo seems better to argue with.

1328
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:30,427
Your mind is so corrupted.

1329
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:35,232
I just bought a new buffalo,
and her name is Sheila.

1330
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:37,660
Ohh...

1331
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:42,540
Teacher, how many months
is your wife pregnant? - One month.

1332
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:45,170
Mine too.
- I see...

1333
01:06:45,235 --> 01:06:48,682
So this happened before
the posters were published? - Yes.

1334
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:52,083
People will say that
you two fired your guns...

1335
01:06:52,142 --> 01:06:53,246
...before it got clogged.

1336
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:54,310
Brother...

1337
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:58,091
But Chaudhan/ sir,
even/one must know that we're men too.

1338
01:06:58,148 --> 01:06:59,218
We didn't get any operation done...

1339
01:06:59,282 --> 01:07:01,262
Are you going to ruin
some girl's reputation...

1340
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:03,058
...just to prove that you're a man?

1341
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,962
Aren't you ashamed?

1342
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:06,223
Go home...

1343
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:09,561
And that Chokan, he asked
us to come back after 10-12 days.

1344
01:07:09,626 --> 01:07:13,073
Let's wait until then,
and we'll see after that.

1345
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:14,073
Okay.

1346
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:17,106
Until then, good night you two.

1347
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:18,441
Yes, brother.

1348
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:22,082
Yes...we care.

1349
01:07:22,672 --> 01:07:26,552
Wow...the baby's showing
remarkable progress.

1350
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:28,451
Do you see?

1351
01:07:28,645 --> 01:07:30,591
Papa...

1352
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:34,287
Can you see the baby?
- Yes, I can.

1353
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:37,627
Did baby see papa's poster?

1354
01:07:39,122 --> 01:07:41,728
Was that the baby's voice?
- That was me.

1355
01:07:43,026 --> 01:07:44,266
Naughty»-

1356
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,062
Sorn], sorn]...

1357
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:47,199
Well, we're done here.

1358
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:48,571
Come out...

1359
01:07:48,665 --> 01:07:51,009
Teacher, come with me.
- Yes.

1360
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:52,379
I'll wait outside.

1361
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:53,709
Come, teacher. Come.

1362
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:59,212
It's a good thing she got pregnant
with the baby before your operation.

1363
01:07:59,276 --> 01:08:01,449
Otherwise...
- Doctor...

1364
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:03,184
Stop calling it a baby.

1365
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:05,116
It can be a male too.

1366
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,250
What are you saying?

1367
01:08:07,317 --> 01:08:08,261
Doesn't matter if
it's a boy or a girl.

1368
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:08,989
They are all the same.

1369
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:09,996
Please tell her.

1370
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,225
Did you hear?

1371
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:12,231
Did you hear?

1372
01:08:12,322 --> 01:08:13,494
Even the doctor's saying...

1373
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:15,433
There's no difference
between a boy or girl.

1374
01:08:15,492 --> 01:08:16,334
Did you hear?

1375
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:20,598
You'll know the difference
when I'll leave you if it's a girl!

1376
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:23,342
The divorce papers are ready.

1377
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,035
Doctor...

1378
01:08:25,635 --> 01:08:29,447
Doctor, please tell her
whether it's a boy or a girl.

1379
01:08:29,506 --> 01:08:31,679
If it's a girl, then I'll
be free ofthis burden right now.

1380
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:33,618
No, teacher...| cannot do that.

1381
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:36,623
Sex determination
ofthe fetus is a crime.

1382
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:40,092
The doctor and the patient,
can both be jailed.

1383
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:42,026
As a doctor I say...

1384
01:08:42,085 --> 01:08:44,565
...whether it's a boy or a girl
or whatever, you must accept it.

1385
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:48,068
Because now he's put
a permanent full stop.

1386
01:08:49,726 --> 01:08:51,034
I don't care...

1387
01:08:51,161 --> 01:08:52,299
I want a boy...

1388
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:53,735
You want a boy...

1389
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:55,538
What's wrong with girls?

1390
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:56,668
Look at the doctor.

1391
01:08:56,733 --> 01:08:59,111
Even she was a girl
before she became a doctor.

1392
01:08:59,402 --> 01:09:01,973
Was? - But it's the boy
who carries the lineage ahead.

1393
01:09:02,038 --> 01:09:03,108
I don't want a boy...

1394
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:06,176
And the teacher has even
put up posters propagating it.

1395
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:10,617
You see...| want a boy.
- I'll tn]!

1396
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:15,151
And if it's not a boy, then
you'll no longer be a pan of my life.

1397
01:09:15,218 --> 01:09:16,697
Understood?
- I did.

1398
01:09:16,953 --> 01:09:18,023
Now let's go.

1399
01:09:18,121 --> 01:09:20,032
Teacher...
- What?

1400
01:09:21,024 --> 01:09:25,200
What, doctor? - You can
pay my fee outside, otherwise...

1401
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:33,080
Yes, brother.
- Where are you professor, come over quickly.

1402
01:09:33,136 --> 01:09:34,114
I am coming.

1403
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,980
Balwant...
- Balwant, come out.

1404
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,213
You said 12 days,
it's been 15 days now.

1405
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:40,117
Come out, you...

1406
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:43,157
You took the evidence
but not a peep out of you.

1407
01:09:43,213 --> 01:09:44,988
You don't answer our calls
or meet us at your office.

1408
01:09:45,048 --> 01:09:46,026
You said you will help us.

1409
01:09:46,082 --> 01:09:47,686
Come out of your house Balwant.

1410
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:50,698
Come out now like a prize
winning Iottenj, or else...

1411
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:52,096
What are you doing?

1412
01:09:52,155 --> 01:09:53,463
Hey you...

1413
01:09:54,758 --> 01:09:56,999
Shall I break his window?
- Break it.

1414
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:01,033
Balwant, come out.

1415
01:10:01,097 --> 01:10:02,041
Balwant, come out.

1416
01:10:02,098 --> 01:10:03,406
Brother,
should I break down the pot too?

1417
01:10:03,466 --> 01:10:05,207
Pot. Break it.

1418
01:10:05,268 --> 01:10:06,747
Break it.

1419
01:10:07,003 --> 01:10:11,179
Teacher...stop him.
- Yes, brother.

1420
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:13,217
They don't know how
foolish they are acting.

1421
01:10:13,276 --> 01:10:16,416
Go stop them or I won't
be able to control myself.

1422
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:17,480
Yes, brother.

1423
01:10:18,748 --> 01:10:20,125
Come out.

1424
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,359
Break down his house. Break it down.

1425
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,063
Hold on... hold on.

1426
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:27,791
What is this?

1427
01:10:30,293 --> 01:10:31,271
It's a lock.

1428
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:33,429
That means...
- It's locked.

1429
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:35,165
Locked.

1430
01:10:35,532 --> 01:10:36,510
You fool...

1431
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:40,445
Normally, when there's no one at home,
there's always a lock.

1432
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:43,746
Teacher.

1433
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:47,613
Let's go meet Balwanfs assistant.

1434
01:10:47,677 --> 01:10:49,315
You are right teacher.

1435
01:10:49,379 --> 01:10:51,450
Come on, Murari. Let’s go
to Ravi’s home and break his bones.

1436
01:10:51,514 --> 01:10:54,427
But this time, I'll go first.
- Papa, bathroom.

1437
01:10:54,484 --> 01:10:55,758
Quiet, Quiet, Quiet.

1438
01:11:02,192 --> 01:11:04,468
Are we waiting for
her to finish smoking?

1439
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:08,106
Chaudhan/ sir...

1440
01:11:08,398 --> 01:11:09,308
Aunty...

1441
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,301
Aunty...

1442
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:15,373
Aunty... Aunty...

1443
01:11:17,173 --> 01:11:18,277
Aunty...!

1444
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:20,278
Who is it?

1445
01:11:22,545 --> 01:11:25,321
Dharmender.
- No, his son.

1446
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:29,186
Isee...

1447
01:11:29,586 --> 01:11:32,658
Let that be, aunty...and tell
us where are you hiding them?

1448
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:34,395
Why Will I hide it?

1449
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:35,333
I never hide it.

1450
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:37,166
Here's the pack of cigarettes.

1451
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:41,131
Aunty, can you tell
us where is your son Ravi?

1452
01:11:41,197 --> 01:11:41,607
Yeah...

1453
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:44,440
Have you seen him?
- No, son.

1454
01:11:44,501 --> 01:11:46,708
I haven't seen him for four years,

1455
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:49,306
since I lost my sight.

1456
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:51,282
Have you seen Ravi?

1457
01:11:51,441 --> 01:11:52,511
How does my boy look?

1458
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,145
He's a big idiot.

1459
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,689
Ifl ever find that son of a gun...

1460
01:11:55,745 --> 01:11:57,486
...| will strangle him, that bloody...

1461
01:11:57,547 --> 01:11:59,288
I'll settle his installment.

1462
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,358
You will kill my son?

1463
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:03,192
You?

1464
01:12:03,253 --> 01:12:06,132
Before that,
I will riddle your body with bullets!

1465
01:12:06,189 --> 01:12:07,099
Hey"-

1466
01:12:07,157 --> 01:12:08,659
You bloody...

1467
01:12:08,725 --> 01:12:10,204
Hey Gun?

1468
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:15,236
The old lady has lost her mind.

1469
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:23,345
Hey.

1470
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:28,214
Why did you stop?

1471
01:12:28,278 --> 01:12:29,450
Haven't you eaten?

1472
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:31,686
Teacher - He's frozen.
- Teacher.

1473
01:12:32,215 --> 01:12:33,250
Run, teacher.

1474
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:36,486
Come on, Princess...

1475
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:38,463
It was working fine until now.

1476
01:12:38,788 --> 01:12:41,428
I wonder what's wrong with it.
- Come on... Come on...

1477
01:12:49,265 --> 01:12:50,403
It works...

1478
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:53,208
Bhura, dump the bodies in the river.

1479
01:12:53,269 --> 01:12:54,771
And clean the blood stains
from the couﬂyard.

1480
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,540
And get me a pack
of cigarettes as well.

1481
01:12:58,174 --> 01:13:01,280
Hello, alpha to gama.
- Sa Re Ga Ma.

1482
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:06,119
Did aunt light up the scene?
- Yes...but they all sun/ived.

1483
01:13:06,182 --> 01:13:08,560
But, let's see how
long they can sun/ive.

1484
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:18,505
Brother, why did you call me
to the farmhouse so urgently?

1485
01:13:20,096 --> 01:13:21,439
I spoke with Mongia.

1486
01:13:21,631 --> 01:13:23,304
He's given up.

1487
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:25,771
And said we should
go to the Secretariat...

1488
01:13:26,035 --> 01:13:27,571
...and meet technical director Rekha.

1489
01:13:28,271 --> 01:13:30,376
Now, only she can help us out.

1490
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:33,281
And Arjun called too.

1491
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,082
He wanted to say something impoﬂant.

1492
01:13:35,211 --> 01:13:36,281
He'll be here any minute.

1493
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:38,481
What does he want?

1494
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:42,658
Let me warn you, brother...he's
dimwit who likes to invite trouble.

1495
01:13:43,186 --> 01:13:45,029
He'll definitely
get us in some trouble.

1496
01:13:51,327 --> 01:13:53,329
Who is this girl?

1497
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,471
Chaudhan/ sir, this is Riya.

1498
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:01,446
My love.

1499
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:06,181
You know, her father isn't
giving us permission to get married.

1500
01:14:06,709 --> 01:14:08,279
So?
- So what?

1501
01:14:09,078 --> 01:14:10,352
I eloped with her.

1502
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,489
Here? - Yes, we'll keep her at
your farmhouse for a couple of days.

1503
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:17,120
Brother...| was right.

1504
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:18,665
You numbskull...

1505
01:14:18,721 --> 01:14:21,292
Those posters have already
caused us lot of embarrassment.

1506
01:14:21,424 --> 01:14:23,995
Why do you want to spoil
our reputation as well?

1507
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,233
Teacher...
- The teacher is right.

1508
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,501
You've already made one mistake.

1509
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:30,305
Why do you want to add to
our troubles by eloping with her?

1510
01:14:30,366 --> 01:14:32,346
Take her back home,
and we'll talk after that.

1511
01:14:32,402 --> 01:14:33,346
Brother...

1512
01:14:36,706 --> 01:14:41,485
If my father finds out,
then he'll kill me and my child.

1513
01:14:43,379 --> 01:14:46,121
And, if anything happens
to Riya and this child...

1514
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,158
...then, I will raze the
entire village down to dust.

1515
01:14:48,785 --> 01:14:50,423
I didn't want to elope with Riya.

1516
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,097
But, I didn't have an option.

1517
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:55,726
I thought she can
stay at your farmhouse...

1518
01:14:56,259 --> 01:14:58,102
...unti| we can prove our innocence.

1519
01:14:58,261 --> 01:14:59,365
But it's okay, I understand.

1520
01:14:59,696 --> 01:15:01,232
You're in trouble too...

1521
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:03,542
I'll make some other arrangements.

1522
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,006
Come, Baby...
- Wait, Arjun.

1523
01:15:07,637 --> 01:15:09,480
Suhasini.
- Coming, brother.

1524
01:15:09,973 --> 01:15:11,316
Suhasini is our caretaker.

1525
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:13,051
She will look after her.

1526
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:14,019
Yes, brother.

1527
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,414
She is Riya.

1528
01:15:16,613 --> 01:15:18,456
She will stay here for few days.

1529
01:15:19,415 --> 01:15:20,257
Go on.

1530
01:15:22,318 --> 01:15:22,989
Come.

1531
01:15:27,724 --> 01:15:29,203
Thank you, brother.

1532
01:15:31,427 --> 01:15:33,668
Arjun, we must go to
the Secretariat tomorrow.

1533
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:36,505
To meet technical director Rekha.
- We will.

1534
01:15:38,768 --> 01:15:41,578
Mr. Trivedi,
we want to meet Rekha madam.

1535
01:15:41,771 --> 01:15:43,182
And you are?

1536
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:47,312
I am Jagaavar Chaudhanj, he's
Arjun Singh...and he's Vinay Sharma.

1537
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,049
Village Jangethi.

1538
01:15:53,249 --> 01:15:55,126
‘They are idiots!’

1539
01:15:55,184 --> 01:15:56,754
'Don't let them meet Rekha madam.’

1540
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:00,158
'| hope you remember their names.’

1541
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,997
Jagaavar Chaudhanj, Arjun Singh and...

1542
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:03,059
...what was the third guy's name?’

1543
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:04,002
'Vinay Sharma.'

1544
01:16:06,629 --> 01:16:10,270
Actually, Sir..Rekha madam is busy.

1545
01:16:10,433 --> 01:16:12,106
Please wait outside.

1546
01:16:12,201 --> 01:16:14,408
I'll call you as
soon as she's available.

1547
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:16,074
P|ease...wait outside.

1548
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:22,586
Meet Rekha madam.

1549
01:16:47,403 --> 01:16:49,644
Mr. Mehra,
your file's no madam's table...

1550
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:52,345
...it's as good as done,
but I haven't received any text yet.

1551
01:16:52,408 --> 01:16:53,648
Mr. Trivedi.
- Yes.

1552
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:57,122
Can we meet Madam now?
- Mr. Mehra, I'll call you later.

1553
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,388
Madam has already
left for the day, sir.

1554
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,689
She left.
- How can she leave?

1555
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:03,453
Did she need your permission?

1556
01:17:03,586 --> 01:17:05,429
But, we had to meet her urgently.

1557
01:17:05,488 --> 01:17:06,330
Yes.

1558
01:17:06,389 --> 01:17:09,097
Come back tomorrow. - What if
she's not available tomorrow either.

1559
01:17:09,158 --> 01:17:10,569
Then come back the day
after or the day after that.

1560
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:12,162
We've been waiting
for her over 4 hours.

1561
01:17:12,228 --> 01:17:14,674
Sometimes it takes 4
years...sometimes even 40 years...

1562
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,073
...and yet they don't get to meet.

1563
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:17,110
What are you saying?

1564
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:18,338
What do you mean it takes 40 years?

1565
01:17:18,401 --> 01:17:19,675
Mister, this is the secretariat...

1566
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:22,682
This is not your village square where
people have all the time in the world.

1567
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:24,445
People are busy here.

1568
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:31,720
Sir, I am just an ordinan/ employee.

1569
01:17:32,114 --> 01:17:33,422
She is the boss.

1570
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:36,462
We'll have to follow her orders.

1571
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:40,066
Sir...but in my current situation...

1572
01:17:40,123 --> 01:17:43,468
...whatever I say will
seem like a Iie to you.

1573
01:17:47,196 --> 01:17:49,039
What are you doing, mister?
What are you doing?

1574
01:17:49,098 --> 01:17:50,270
Throw him down.

1575
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:50,743
Chaudhan/ sir.

1576
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,344
Why didn't you tell us
that Rekha madam is leaving?

1577
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:54,779
Yes, why not?

1578
01:17:55,037 --> 01:17:57,608
|...|...| was going to tell you.

1579
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,084
Sir, have mercy.

1580
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:01,519
I have a wife and two small kids.

1581
01:18:01,577 --> 01:18:02,453
Leave him.

1582
01:18:02,512 --> 01:18:04,185
Throw that idiot down.

1583
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:05,021
Isee...

1584
01:18:05,081 --> 01:18:07,186
Hey...
- Police!

1585
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:08,159
Let Trivedi go.

1586
01:18:08,217 --> 01:18:10,458
Chaudhan/ sir,
the police are here.

1587
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:13,625
I say let him go.
- Don't leave me.

1588
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,600
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.

1589
01:18:15,658 --> 01:18:16,500
Who said let him go?

1590
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:17,970
Pull me up and let me go.

1591
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:18,971
First, pull me up. Pull me up.

1592
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:20,098
Pull him up.

1593
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:24,406
What are you doing?

1594
01:18:26,502 --> 01:18:28,709
Pull him up, or else I will shoot.

1595
01:18:28,971 --> 01:18:29,711
Don't shoot.

1596
01:18:29,972 --> 01:18:34,250
Selfie.
- Look here.

1597
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:36,148
Look here... Now pout.

1598
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:38,158
I said pout.
- Pout?

1599
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:39,215
Pout.

1600
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:40,157
Pout.

1601
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:41,217
Pout.

1602
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:43,354
Don't shout... pout.
- Yes...

1603
01:18:43,419 --> 01:18:44,489
Pout.

1604
01:18:46,355 --> 01:18:48,096
Pout...
- Yes...

1605
01:18:49,325 --> 01:18:50,668
Yes...

1606
01:18:50,993 --> 01:18:51,630
Pull him up.

1607
01:18:51,694 --> 01:18:52,399
This is for evidence.

1608
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:53,132
Now come up.

1609
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:54,538
Come on. Come up.

1610
01:18:58,267 --> 01:19:00,213
So that's why you
hung him upside down.

1611
01:19:00,269 --> 01:19:02,271
But, what will you do
about their negative thinking?

1612
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:05,647
Ifthey weren’t so negative...

1613
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:08,715
...then, they wou|d’ve turned you into
heroes, instead of humiliating you.

1614
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:11,480
We need to change their thinking,
Chaudhan/ sir.

1615
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,491
And that’s why I suggest
that you go to the court.

1616
01:19:13,983 --> 01:19:16,020
Defend your case and win.

1617
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:19,022
That's when you'll bring
about a change, understand?

1618
01:19:25,328 --> 01:19:26,966
Inspector's right.

1619
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:29,033
Let's file a coun case?

1620
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:32,437
We'll get justice in 50-60 years.

1621
01:19:36,172 --> 01:19:39,619
We're giving too
much imponance to this.

1622
01:19:40,076 --> 01:19:41,350
Let's wait and watch.

1623
01:19:41,577 --> 01:19:43,750
Soon even/one will forget
in a couple of months.

1624
01:19:46,182 --> 01:19:47,593
Will Soorajmukhi forget?

1625
01:19:48,651 --> 01:19:50,358
Will Riya's father forget?

1626
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:55,332
Will my sister's in-laws forget?

1627
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:58,029
This is an unnecessan/ effon,
brother.

1628
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:00,664
It'll will only cause
us loads of sweat.

1629
01:20:01,564 --> 01:20:04,374
The coun has never
made things easy for anyone.

1630
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:07,273
This is exactly why
we never progress...

1631
01:20:08,037 --> 01:20:10,347
We throw down our weapons
even before we can fight. - Yes.

1632
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:14,349
It's a good thing that Chandershekhar
Azad and Bhagat Singh didn't think like that...

1633
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:17,619
...who worked hard
to liberate our countnj.

1634
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:22,026
And now, why can't we put
in a little effort for a court case?

1635
01:20:22,084 --> 01:20:24,086
You're absolutely right, brother.

1636
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:27,100
One should do anything possible
to save their reputation.

1637
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:29,792
Look, teacher.

1638
01:20:30,726 --> 01:20:35,471
You for Soorajmukhi,
Arjun for Riya and me for my sister...

1639
01:20:35,531 --> 01:20:37,204
...we must fight this battle.
- Yes.

1640
01:20:37,767 --> 01:20:41,271
We must prove our innocence.

1641
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:42,407
Yes.

1642
01:20:44,473 --> 01:20:45,679
You're right, brother.

1643
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:47,646
You're right.

1644
01:20:48,377 --> 01:20:52,826
We must drag this
deaf government to court

1645
01:20:53,082 --> 01:20:54,186
Yeah...

1646
01:20:55,251 --> 01:20:57,322
You've come to the right place.

1647
01:20:57,386 --> 01:21:00,595
People say that,
if you want to win a case...

1648
01:21:00,656 --> 01:21:05,366
...you don't need luck,
you need Jaanki Bhai Sonipatwala.

1649
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:07,270
Jaanki Bhai...Sardar?

1650
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:08,672
Gujarati is my mother's tongue.

1651
01:21:08,998 --> 01:21:10,204
Ohhh - You don't worn].

1652
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:12,575
I'll give this government
a run for their money.

1653
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:15,238
Ajay...
- Yes.

1654
01:21:15,304 --> 01:21:18,148
Remember my TV Reponer friend Aniket.
- Yes.

1655
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:23,486
Call him up and tell
him we've got breaking news.

1656
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:27,125
You mean we'll come on television.

1657
01:21:27,182 --> 01:21:28,092
You won't just come on television,

1658
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:29,561
You'll be all over it.

1659
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:32,656
We'll be on top ofthis case.

1660
01:21:33,422 --> 01:21:35,095
Unbelievable, teacher.

1661
01:21:38,294 --> 01:21:39,739
I swear...

1662
01:21:42,097 --> 01:21:43,440
Yes, Rekha madam.

1663
01:21:43,499 --> 01:21:45,410
Sir...
- Hmm...

1664
01:21:46,669 --> 01:21:49,081
Do you like roses?

1665
01:21:50,172 --> 01:21:51,378
Even/day-

1666
01:21:53,075 --> 01:21:56,352
We return once again with news
about to the Health Ministnj.

1667
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:59,154
Just recently the Health
Ministn/ was in the headlines...

1668
01:21:59,214 --> 01:22:00,386
...for expired medicine scam...

1669
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:02,554
...and now their names are being dragged in
another scandal.
— Sir, news about our department.

1670
01:22:02,718 --> 01:22:06,530
Come, we'll introduce you to these
Poster boys from Jangethi village...

1671
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:10,628
...who are a living example
ofthe government's biggest mistake.

1672
01:22:10,693 --> 01:22:12,297
Mr. Jagaavar, what do have to say?

1673
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:15,399
Well, we want to say that
we never went for any vasectomy camp.

1674
01:22:15,464 --> 01:22:16,169
Yeah...

1675
01:22:16,232 --> 01:22:18,678
They just printed our
pictures on the posters.

1676
01:22:18,734 --> 01:22:21,112
Without your permission.
- Exactly!

1677
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:23,673
Why will we give permission for
anything like that? - Absolutely right.

1678
01:22:23,739 --> 01:22:25,343
I see...now, let's talk to Arjun.

1679
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,148
See...

1680
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:29,348
We know who is responsible for this.

1681
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:31,220
Pretty soon they will
be running for their lives...

1682
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,486
...and we'll beat them to a pulp.
- These people will never learn.

1683
01:22:32,548 --> 01:22:36,155
We're going to give them
a sound thrashing.

1684
01:22:36,218 --> 01:22:38,630
And now, we'll let you
know the teacher's opinion.

1685
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,425
We went to the Secretariat.

1686
01:22:40,489 --> 01:22:42,093
And we...
- Look here.

1687
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:44,433
And we weren't allowed to
meet Technical Director, Ms. Rekha.

1688
01:22:44,493 --> 01:22:46,029
What did you do? Tell us tell us.

1689
01:22:46,095 --> 01:22:50,669
You didn't tell me.
- Yes, sir...they did.

1690
01:22:50,733 --> 01:22:52,406
They made quite a scene.

1691
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:53,742
Trivedi told me about them.

1692
01:22:53,803 --> 01:22:56,511
But...| couldn't meet them.
- Why?

1693
01:22:56,572 --> 01:22:59,678
Because that day we were at the hotel...
- Yeah, okay.

1694
01:22:59,742 --> 01:23:00,743
Absolutely right.

1695
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:02,311
We want justice.

1696
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:03,287
Justice!

1697
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:08,655
Sir, the TV's switched off...

1698
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:10,993
Can I staﬂ now?
- Wait...

1699
01:23:11,053 --> 01:23:13,556
First, go and handle
this Jangethi case.

1700
01:23:13,622 --> 01:23:15,329
And meet with that Mongia and...

1701
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:16,626
What's the ba|dy's name?
- Balwant.

1702
01:23:16,692 --> 01:23:18,262
Balwant.
- Go meet with them.

1703
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,170
Otherwise, we'll get in big trouble.

1704
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:21,435
P|ease...go...

1705
01:23:21,597 --> 01:23:23,133
Sure?
- Yes, go.

1706
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:26,008
Okay, sir. We’|| call them tomorrow.

1707
01:23:28,404 --> 01:23:31,613
How can she be in one mood all day?

1708
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:34,449
What is this charade?

1709
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:36,245
And with whose permission?

1710
01:23:36,312 --> 01:23:38,451
Not me, ma'am. It was them.

1711
01:23:39,281 --> 01:23:41,386
What was the urgency
to print the posters?

1712
01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:42,485
What could I do, madam?

1713
01:23:42,551 --> 01:23:45,327
Minister sir wanted to inaugurate
the Vasectomy Camp.

1714
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:46,161
So...

1715
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:48,292
And we needed posters.
- Yes.

1716
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:49,233
And I asked him...

1717
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:49,792
Ask him.

1718
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:56,439
But, he raised his hand
like a Laughing Buddha statue...

1719
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:01,507
And that's why...we got
the posters printed in a haste.

1720
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:03,550
I see...got the posters printed?

1721
01:24:03,973 --> 01:24:05,452
What will I tell the minister now?

1722
01:24:06,308 --> 01:24:08,413
People are raising fingers
at the minister because of you.

1723
01:24:08,477 --> 01:24:09,683
And he's getting hot-headed on me.

1724
01:24:09,745 --> 01:24:13,158
Well, madam,
that's between you and the Minister.

1725
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:15,159
What?

1726
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:16,293
What did you say?

1727
01:24:16,352 --> 01:24:18,263
I was just joking.

1728
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,424
Are you my brother-in-Iaw?

1729
01:24:19,488 --> 01:24:21,195
That you were joking with me.

1730
01:24:21,457 --> 01:24:22,367
Show me your repons!

1731
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:22,731
Yes.

1732
01:24:22,992 --> 01:24:25,199
Repoﬂ...
- Here's the report

1733
01:24:26,629 --> 01:24:28,768
Ma'am, the coun
has also sent a notice.

1734
01:24:29,031 --> 01:24:29,736
What do I do now?

1735
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:32,603
Do anything...

1736
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:35,676
But if fingers are raised
at the Health Ministnj...

1737
01:24:38,273 --> 01:24:41,015
...then I'll make sure
your health deteriorates too.

1738
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:42,180
Understood?

1739
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:46,014
It's all over.

1740
01:24:46,615 --> 01:24:48,458
And, we're getting humiliated
all over the village.

1741
01:24:48,517 --> 01:24:51,191
Why don't you withdraw
your case against the government?

1742
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,227
Brother,
you cannot harm the government.

1743
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:54,665
But, our reputation
is getting damaged.

1744
01:24:56,759 --> 01:25:00,468
And now...| can't contest
for the village-council elections.

1745
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:05,168
And Anja|i...better get
Sunil out of your mind.

1746
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:08,744
Because he doesn't care
whether we live or die.

1747
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:15,215
Fine, I'll withdraw my case.

1748
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:20,192
Ifl withdraw the case, then
maybe you can contest the elections...

1749
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:23,391
...but, will she get married?

1750
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:25,391
No, she won't.

1751
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:27,665
I will fight this case...

1752
01:25:28,424 --> 01:25:29,425
Iwillwin...

1753
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:32,438
And then, Anjali will get married.

1754
01:25:40,369 --> 01:25:42,315
You don't have the same power anymore.

1755
01:25:42,371 --> 01:25:44,146
I'll settle your installments,
you buffoon...

1756
01:25:44,206 --> 01:25:47,050
You must come with
me to the police station.

1757
01:25:47,109 --> 01:25:49,350
There's a complaint filed
against you for kidnapping Riya.

1758
01:25:49,411 --> 01:25:52,585
Boss has already informed the police.
- Arjun, I am no longer your boss.

1759
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:57,419
You've been fired.
- Fired?

1760
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:02,535
Look Arjun, you must withdraw
your case against the government.

1761
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:04,635
Look, small-time recoven/ is okay.

1762
01:26:04,693 --> 01:26:07,401
But it's not your cup of tea
to challenge the government.

1763
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:10,738
Take him in.

1764
01:26:12,301 --> 01:26:13,405
Just a minute.

1765
01:26:16,505 --> 01:26:19,076
Vinay, you're being
transferred to a place...

1766
01:26:19,408 --> 01:26:21,547
...where you'll never see any student.

1767
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:24,680
But, my advice to you is that...

1768
01:26:25,314 --> 01:26:28,227
...you should withdraw your case,
and even/thing will be fine.

1769
01:26:28,617 --> 01:26:32,292
What will you achieve by filing
the case against the government?

1770
01:26:33,622 --> 01:26:34,532
Family.

1771
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:37,025
Family, sir.

1772
01:26:38,227 --> 01:26:39,672
I cannot lose my family.

1773
01:26:41,263 --> 01:26:43,174
And, don't forget I am a teacher.

1774
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:46,472
Ifl don't stand
up against injustice...

1775
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:49,539
...then, how will I teach
the children about right or wrong?

1776
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:53,352
Thank you, sir.

1777
01:27:20,102 --> 01:27:25,108
Do you know...
the police has arrested Arjun.

1778
01:27:25,441 --> 01:27:26,545
I know.

1779
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:30,055
Then you must know that
he eloped with some girl.

1780
01:27:30,512 --> 01:27:31,456
I know that too.

1781
01:27:31,513 --> 01:27:33,686
I wonder where is he
hiding that poor girl.

1782
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:37,489
Some idiot must be helping him.

1783
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:42,031
And these stupid people
who help these idiots.

1784
01:27:42,091 --> 01:27:45,698
You know, I want to
get hold ofthese hooligans...

1785
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:47,707
...and beat them to a pulp publicly...

1786
01:27:47,763 --> 01:27:49,333
Hey!

1787
01:27:50,665 --> 01:27:53,646
What's wrong with you?
- Why are you abusing people?

1788
01:27:53,702 --> 01:27:55,443
I...
-Yes.

1789
01:27:57,139 --> 01:27:57,640
Phone...

1790
01:27:57,706 --> 01:27:58,776
Pickup my phone...

1791
01:27:59,074 --> 01:27:59,779
Yes.

1792
01:28:03,011 --> 01:28:05,617
Hello.
- Hello, is this Jagaavar's number?

1793
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:12,121
Who are you?
- Please give him the phone.

1794
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:18,497
Listen...
- Hmm...

1795
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,097
What time is it?
- Is someone asking for the time?

1796
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:23,168
It's 12 o'clock (midnight).

1797
01:28:24,066 --> 01:28:26,444
It's some female on the phone,
and she wants to talk to you.

1798
01:28:27,703 --> 01:28:28,681
Female?

1799
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:41,093
Hello.
- Brother, it's Riya.

1800
01:28:42,184 --> 01:28:42,719
Hello.

1801
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:44,088
Yes speak.

1802
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:49,132
I've been throwing up since evening,
and Arjun's phone is unreachable.

1803
01:28:49,358 --> 01:28:50,632
I am really scared.

1804
01:28:50,692 --> 01:28:53,195
Please come over quickly.

1805
01:28:53,261 --> 01:28:56,174
Yes...|'m coming.

1806
01:28:58,567 --> 01:29:00,274
It's Suhasini.
- What's wrong with her?

1807
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:01,541
She is throwing up.

1808
01:29:01,603 --> 01:29:05,210
No-no... not her, Sheila...

1809
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,379
The Buffa|o...she's throwing up.

1810
01:29:08,477 --> 01:29:10,218
Do buffa|o's puke too?
- Yes.

1811
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:15,228
Women puke, don't they?
And, the Buffalo's a female.

1812
01:29:15,283 --> 01:29:19,231
I see... - Please come soon, brother.
I am really scared.

1813
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:22,200
She's scared... She's scared...

1814
01:29:22,691 --> 01:29:23,499
I am coming.

1815
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:26,004
I am coming...coming...

1816
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,064
Why didn't Suhasini speak to me?

1817
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:28,699
Huh?

1818
01:29:29,464 --> 01:29:30,704
Good question.

1819
01:29:31,166 --> 01:29:32,338
I'll ask her.

1820
01:29:32,401 --> 01:29:33,277
Can I go now?

1821
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:36,109
I must take a doctor...
for the buffalo.

1822
01:29:36,171 --> 01:29:37,081
OK8V~

1823
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:39,375
listen...

1824
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:41,745
I can't let you go alone at this hour.

1825
01:29:42,077 --> 01:29:43,647
I'll come along with you too.
- No-no-no...what will you do?

1826
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:46,056
It's midnight. Stay here.

1827
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:46,751
But, don't go alone.

1828
01:29:47,015 --> 01:29:48,426
Take Anuj with you. Anuj...

1829
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:51,020
Yes, sister-in-Iaw.
- Go back to sleep.

1830
01:29:51,253 --> 01:29:54,132
I'll take the teacher with me.
- The teacher?

1831
01:29:54,189 --> 01:30:00,140
What can he do?
- He just got a sonography done of his buffalo.

1832
01:30:00,495 --> 01:30:03,772
Does the teacher have a Buffalo too?
- Yes, a big one.

1833
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:05,611
I never saw it.

1834
01:30:05,667 --> 01:30:07,044
He keeps her inside...

1835
01:30:07,102 --> 01:30:09,275
She's berserk...
- I see...

1836
01:30:10,472 --> 01:30:11,746
S0 |...|...

1837
01:30:12,007 --> 01:30:13,179
I am getting late.

1838
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,016
I'll call you.

1839
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:28,427
Pick up...

1840
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:31,631
Pick up...

1841
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:37,806
Hello.
- Hello.

1842
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:44,810
Teacher...remember the
buffalo who is pregnant.

1843
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:49,520
She's ven/ restless since evening.
- So, what can I do, brother?

1844
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:50,749
Listen to me and understand.

1845
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:51,813
Understand...

1846
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:54,390
So, you are coming with the doctor...

1847
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:57,723
And, I am coming too.

1848
01:30:57,786 --> 01:31:00,630
Arjun is not coming. He's in lockup.

1849
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:02,200
But you are coming for sure...

1850
01:31:02,257 --> 01:31:03,361
Understood?

1851
01:31:03,425 --> 01:31:04,529
You are coming.

1852
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:06,162
Who is coming and who is going?

1853
01:31:06,228 --> 01:31:07,730
Are you understanding or not?

1854
01:31:07,996 --> 01:31:08,736
Are You?

1855
01:31:08,997 --> 01:31:11,136
Teacher are you or are you not?
- Yeah...Yeah...Ya'

1856
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:16,308
I get it, brother.
I got it. Riyal Arjun's Riyal

1857
01:31:16,672 --> 01:31:18,174
I am coming!

1858
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:21,220
I am coming with the doctor.

1859
01:31:21,276 --> 01:31:23,051
Okay... I am coming.

1860
01:31:23,111 --> 01:31:27,560
Strange... What's this
way of talking to the teacher?

1861
01:31:28,617 --> 01:31:29,789
The teacher is from Bhopal.

1862
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:30,552
Bhopal.

1863
01:31:30,619 --> 01:31:31,791
That's how they talk.

1864
01:31:32,054 --> 01:31:32,794
I am leaving.

1865
01:31:33,054 --> 01:31:34,089
I am leaving.

1866
01:31:34,589 --> 01:31:36,227
The teacher is from Bhopal?

1867
01:31:45,334 --> 01:31:46,369
What is this?

1868
01:31:48,637 --> 01:31:50,708
Brother,
didn't I tell you the other day?

1869
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:52,511
It's a night dress.

1870
01:31:52,574 --> 01:31:56,784
Not that, what is this?
- Ask the right question, brother?

1871
01:31:57,045 --> 01:31:58,285
It's a who, not what.

1872
01:31:58,580 --> 01:32:00,355
She's the doctor.
- I...

1873
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:03,587
Why did you tie her up
with the veil?

1874
01:32:03,652 --> 01:32:06,155
I woke her up and told
her it's an emergency.

1875
01:32:06,221 --> 01:32:08,599
She said I'll come along,
but which vehicle do you have.

1876
01:32:08,657 --> 01:32:09,727
I said it's a scooter.

1877
01:32:09,991 --> 01:32:12,062
She said she falls
asleep on the scooter.

1878
01:32:12,394 --> 01:32:15,671
I thought what if she
falls down and dies, so...

1879
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:17,107
...| tied her to myself.

1880
01:32:17,165 --> 01:32:18,041
Isee...

1881
01:32:18,099 --> 01:32:19,373
Doctor, wake up.

1882
01:32:19,568 --> 01:32:21,047
Doctor, wake up.

1883
01:32:21,102 --> 01:32:23,639
The deliven/‘s done.
Healthy and strong.

1884
01:32:23,705 --> 01:32:25,082
Oh! thank you so much.

1885
01:32:27,109 --> 01:32:30,056
Oh my, God. Hello...
- Hello.

1886
01:32:30,112 --> 01:32:33,184
I've seen you before.
- Seen me?

1887
01:32:33,248 --> 01:32:34,750
Yes..
- How's it possible?

1888
01:32:35,016 --> 01:32:37,519
It's true... I've seen him before.

1889
01:32:37,586 --> 01:32:41,124
Where have I seen him? - I just came
to live in this village <i>2</i> years ago.

1890
01:32:41,189 --> 01:32:42,031
Isee...

1891
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:47,369
Before this, I was at the Kashmir border,
the Ladakh border, the Rajasthan border.

1892
01:32:47,429 --> 01:32:48,237
Not there...

1893
01:32:48,296 --> 01:32:49,798
Then where did I see you?

1894
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:51,476
You must have seen
him in JP Dutta's ‘Border’.

1895
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:53,068
Doctor, come along.

1896
01:32:53,134 --> 01:32:54,112
Come, madam. Please.

1897
01:32:54,169 --> 01:32:56,115
Let's go...|et's go...
- JP Dutta...

1898
01:32:56,171 --> 01:32:58,378
Doctor, the patient is throwing up,
let's go.

1899
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,277
Who is the patient?
- It's her.

1900
01:33:01,343 --> 01:33:03,220
Who is she?
- She's the patient...

1901
01:33:04,379 --> 01:33:07,622
How is she related to you?
- She is...

1902
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:09,525
She... she's his wife.

1903
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:11,120
Wife?
- Wife!

1904
01:33:11,186 --> 01:33:14,190
Your wife? She?

1905
01:33:15,223 --> 01:33:17,032
No-no-no...

1906
01:33:17,092 --> 01:33:18,435
What else would I have said?

1907
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:22,297
That's not her.

1908
01:33:22,564 --> 01:33:26,034
She's not the girl who
came to my sonography center.

1909
01:33:26,101 --> 01:33:27,603
She's someone else.

1910
01:33:27,669 --> 01:33:28,579
She has changed.

1911
01:33:28,637 --> 01:33:29,411
Who is she?

1912
01:33:29,471 --> 01:33:33,180
Doctor, I brought her for sonography.

1913
01:33:33,241 --> 01:33:34,345
her?

1914
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:36,418
I've 25 years of experience.

1915
01:33:36,478 --> 01:33:39,755
I can guarantee she's not the
one who came to me for sonography.

1916
01:33:40,014 --> 01:33:41,084
She has changed.

1917
01:33:41,149 --> 01:33:42,093
she's someone else.

1918
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:43,356
I can prove it to you.

1919
01:33:43,418 --> 01:33:45,056
She is not your wife.

1920
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,793
Is anyone listening to me?
- Soorajmukhi!

1921
01:33:47,155 --> 01:33:48,725
I am sad!

1922
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,701
Didn't I tell you that you've changed?

1923
01:33:50,759 --> 01:33:52,466
But you never agreed.

1924
01:33:52,661 --> 01:33:56,268
And see...even the doctor
has confirmed today...

1925
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:59,111
You have changed.
You have become different.

1926
01:33:59,167 --> 01:34:00,703
Just like cotton turns
into a piece of cloth...

1927
01:34:00,769 --> 01:34:02,248
Soap turns to foam...

1928
01:34:02,304 --> 01:34:03,214
Similarly...

1929
01:34:07,142 --> 01:34:08,086
Just a minute...

1930
01:34:09,344 --> 01:34:12,553
Forget this...your marriage
will turn into divorce.

1931
01:34:12,614 --> 01:34:14,651
Divorce.
- Divorce. - Divorce.

1932
01:34:15,283 --> 01:34:16,591
You said it three times.

1933
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:17,356
Divorce.

1934
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:19,990
Yes...divorce.

1935
01:34:20,055 --> 01:34:22,695
Doctor, we called
you here to check her up...

1936
01:34:22,757 --> 01:34:25,169
...but you caused a breakup instead.

1937
01:34:25,227 --> 01:34:27,229
What are you saying?
- You're responsible for this.

1938
01:34:27,295 --> 01:34:29,104
I haven't done anything.
- You're responsible.

1939
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:31,269
What is he saying?
- You're responsible!

1940
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:34,075
Brother, I only said it once...

1941
01:34:34,135 --> 01:34:35,705
What are you doing, teacher?

1942
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:37,147
Why are you divorcing
your wife in this condition?

1943
01:34:37,205 --> 01:34:39,685
Yes because she has changed.
Even you said it now.

1944
01:34:39,741 --> 01:34:42,779
No, no.. Misunderstanding.

1945
01:34:43,044 --> 01:34:45,149
I guess I was mistaken.

1946
01:34:45,213 --> 01:34:48,194
I was a|so...s|eepy.
- Isn't it?

1947
01:34:48,783 --> 01:34:51,195
Now that I look at her again...

1948
01:34:51,319 --> 01:34:53,458
yes...that's her.

1949
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:55,262
She came for the sonography.

1950
01:34:55,323 --> 01:34:56,427
Yes, that's her.

1951
01:34:56,491 --> 01:34:58,266
Are you sure?
- Yes, sure.

1952
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:01,132
And your 25-year-old record?
- It's broken.

1953
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:03,540
Broken.
- Records are made for breaking.

1954
01:35:03,665 --> 01:35:05,611
And, I made this
record and I broke it.

1955
01:35:05,667 --> 01:35:06,270
So...

1956
01:35:06,334 --> 01:35:08,314
But, please don't
break your relationship.

1957
01:35:08,637 --> 01:35:11,550
I won't...| won't...
just check her up, please.

1958
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,542
Tell me what you ate.

1959
01:35:14,743 --> 01:35:18,156
Nothing...2 bowls of grams,
<i>2</i> bowls of kidney beans...

1960
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:21,353
...1 bowl of lentil, vegetables, corn
bread, cottage cheese with gravy...

1961
01:35:21,416 --> 01:35:29,233
...four pieces of bread, 1 bowl
of mutton and sweetmeaLwith cream.

1962
01:35:29,558 --> 01:35:32,698
Did you leave anything?
- Yeah, chutney.

1963
01:35:33,128 --> 01:35:34,334
It was ven/ spicy.

1964
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:37,043
No need to worn],
she's got gas.

1965
01:35:37,098 --> 01:35:40,307
Gas... gas...just gas?
- Yeah, just gas.

1966
01:35:40,602 --> 01:35:43,446
Pay attention to your diet,
understand.

1967
01:35:43,505 --> 01:35:44,210
Okay.

1968
01:35:44,272 --> 01:35:45,444
Come, teacher.

1969
01:35:45,507 --> 01:35:46,247
Come on...

1970
01:35:46,307 --> 01:35:48,082
Oh god
- Teacher.

1971
01:35:48,142 --> 01:35:49,348
I am protecting her.

1972
01:35:49,411 --> 01:35:51,288
She sleeps like a
dead body on the scooter...

1973
01:35:51,346 --> 01:35:53,348
...and if she falls down,
she will turn into a real dead body.

1974
01:35:53,415 --> 01:35:54,450
He's right.

1975
01:35:54,516 --> 01:35:56,757
I fell down last month.

1976
01:35:57,018 --> 01:35:58,588
Who was driving?
- Me.

1977
01:36:00,522 --> 01:36:03,128
You mean...
- Shall we?

1978
01:36:03,191 --> 01:36:04,727
Yeah.. bye.
- Bye...

1979
01:36:08,696 --> 01:36:10,232
I had a word with the lawyer...

1980
01:36:10,298 --> 01:36:12,403
...Arjun will come home soon.
- Okay.

1981
01:36:12,701 --> 01:36:15,341
I've called Riya's father too.

1982
01:36:15,537 --> 01:36:16,413
Why?

1983
01:36:16,471 --> 01:36:18,007
We'll convince him...

1984
01:36:18,072 --> 01:36:20,416
...to let Riya and
Arjun get married. - I see.

1985
01:36:20,475 --> 01:36:22,751
You saw what happened
last night. - Hmm.

1986
01:36:23,011 --> 01:36:24,183
Just imagine...

1987
01:36:24,245 --> 01:36:27,317
She should be with her
mother in this condition.

1988
01:36:27,382 --> 01:36:28,725
Oh teacher...

1989
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:31,460
Which doctor did
you take to see Sheila?

1990
01:36:32,187 --> 01:36:34,565
Sheila is absolutely fine now.

1991
01:36:35,323 --> 01:36:36,461
You don't believe me.

1992
01:36:36,524 --> 01:36:37,764
See for yourself.

1993
01:36:38,593 --> 01:36:41,631
Anuj, bring Sheila out!

1994
01:36:50,772 --> 01:36:52,115
You've crossed all limits, brother.

1995
01:36:53,008 --> 01:36:55,079
Hiding Arjun's sin in our farmhouse.

1996
01:36:55,209 --> 01:36:56,779
We already have such a
bad reputation in this village...

1997
01:36:57,045 --> 01:36:58,718
...that you're resoﬂing
to such things.

1998
01:36:59,314 --> 01:37:02,523
Chaudhan/ sir... Hello.
- Hello.

1999
01:37:02,584 --> 01:37:05,690
Mom.
- Riya.

2000
01:37:08,256 --> 01:37:09,462
My child

2001
01:37:09,524 --> 01:37:14,200
So you three kidnapped my daughter.

2002
01:37:14,596 --> 01:37:18,100
I am going to teach you three
a lesson, I'll drag you to couﬂ...

2003
01:37:18,166 --> 01:37:20,009
...or else my name isn't Dharamchand.

2004
01:37:20,268 --> 01:37:22,339
You should stop worn/ing
about your name...

2005
01:37:22,403 --> 01:37:24,576
...and, think of a name
for the one that's on the way.

2006
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:26,676
On the way? Who's on the way?

2007
01:37:26,741 --> 01:37:29,517
Mister this is why we called you here.

2008
01:37:30,412 --> 01:37:32,722
You have to be strong...

2009
01:37:34,049 --> 01:37:38,725
Your daughter is pregnant.
- What?

2010
01:37:38,987 --> 01:37:40,557
With Arjun's child.

2011
01:37:43,992 --> 01:37:45,596
You...
- Dharamchand!

2012
01:37:49,330 --> 01:37:51,606
I admit that Arjun and
your daughter made a mistake.

2013
01:37:52,033 --> 01:37:53,637
But, this is your fault too.

2014
01:37:54,536 --> 01:37:56,743
You didn't give them
permission to get married.

2015
01:37:57,672 --> 01:38:00,653
That's why Arjun brought
her to my farmhouse.

2016
01:38:01,009 --> 01:38:04,718
And anyway, a real man never leaves...

2017
01:38:04,979 --> 01:38:07,357
...and not someone who desens
his love when in an ordeal.

2018
01:38:08,116 --> 01:38:09,993
Arjun cou|d've refused
to marn/ your daughter...

2019
01:38:10,051 --> 01:38:11,462
...after getting her pregnant.

2020
01:38:11,519 --> 01:38:12,395
He cou|d've run away.

2021
01:38:12,454 --> 01:38:13,489
But he didn't run.

2022
01:38:13,555 --> 01:38:14,556
He didn't run...

2023
01:38:15,190 --> 01:38:19,661
Look... Arjun loves
your daughter a lot.

2024
01:38:19,728 --> 01:38:20,968
Yes...

2025
01:38:21,062 --> 01:38:23,975
And you can see the
result ofthat love.

2026
01:38:24,199 --> 01:38:25,234
Teacher?

2027
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:27,975
I admit he made a mistake...

2028
01:38:28,036 --> 01:38:29,140
But let me tell you...

2029
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:34,283
...you will never find anyone
like Arjun no matter how hard you tn].

2030
01:38:34,509 --> 01:38:36,318
I am already tired of Arjun...

2031
01:38:36,544 --> 01:38:38,251
...why would I tn/ to
find someone else like him?

2032
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:42,184
And, you and I know that
she's pregnant with Arjun's child.

2033
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:44,327
But who's going to
convince the villagers?

2034
01:38:44,385 --> 01:38:47,093
They will say that Arjun
can never get anyone pregnant.

2035
01:38:47,155 --> 01:38:48,259
This is entirely my daughter's fault.

2036
01:38:48,323 --> 01:38:50,667
They will point fingers
at my daughter's character.

2037
01:38:51,025 --> 01:38:53,562
No-no-no...| cannot give
permission for this marriage.

2038
01:38:54,162 --> 01:38:58,042
Dharamchand, I'm a family man too.

2039
01:38:58,533 --> 01:39:02,606
I request you for Arjun's sake...

2040
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:03,978
No brother.

2041
01:39:04,038 --> 01:39:05,312
Brother...

2042
01:39:06,174 --> 01:39:09,155
You don't have to plead
to anyone for my sake.

2043
01:39:09,711 --> 01:39:11,247
He's not willing to understand.

2044
01:39:11,312 --> 01:39:13,223
I love Riya, and that's not a crime.

2045
01:39:13,281 --> 01:39:16,057
What I think doesn't matter.

2046
01:39:16,584 --> 01:39:19,258
Your posters are
all over the village...

2047
01:39:19,654 --> 01:39:21,531
...that narrate your entire ston].

2048
01:39:21,589 --> 01:39:23,330
You filed a case against
the government, didn't you?

2049
01:39:23,391 --> 01:39:24,461
Now go...

2050
01:39:24,525 --> 01:39:28,337
Go to the court and prove
that you didn't get a vasectomy done.

2051
01:39:28,396 --> 01:39:31,138
After that, I'll let you marn/ Riya.

2052
01:39:31,199 --> 01:39:32,576
Otherwise,
you can forget Riya for good.

2053
01:39:32,634 --> 01:39:35,274
And, as for this unborn child...

2054
01:39:35,503 --> 01:39:38,575
If you fail to prove
yourself in the couﬂ...

2055
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,210
...this child will never
get to see this world.

2056
01:39:40,275 --> 01:39:41,618
Why you...

2057
01:39:41,676 --> 01:39:43,053
Arjun.

2058
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:45,650
Come on...

2059
01:39:45,713 --> 01:39:47,522
Arjun...
-Come on...

2060
01:39:47,582 --> 01:39:49,619
He's not Mahabharafs Arjun.

2061
01:39:55,223 --> 01:39:57,703
Your honor, this case filed
against the Health Ministnj...

2062
01:39:57,759 --> 01:39:59,670
...is fake and completely baseless.

2063
01:39:59,727 --> 01:40:04,301
These three willingly volunteered
for a vasectomy without stitches.

2064
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:08,043
And now, in order to get more
compensation from the government...

2065
01:40:08,103 --> 01:40:11,550
...these people are making
false allegations, your honor.

2066
01:40:11,606 --> 01:40:14,052
Here are their NOC letters!

2067
01:40:14,109 --> 01:40:17,090
And their Vasectomy ceﬂificates!

2068
01:40:17,144 --> 01:40:21,524
And these photos, which they willingly
handed over to the health depanment!

2069
01:40:21,582 --> 01:40:23,061
He's lying...

2070
01:40:23,117 --> 01:40:26,724
Come here, I'll stick this
poster on your face with my hand.

2071
01:40:26,788 --> 01:40:29,098
He's lying...

2072
01:40:29,157 --> 01:40:30,363
Brother...

2073
01:40:30,491 --> 01:40:32,198
Brother...

2074
01:40:34,262 --> 01:40:35,332
Order! Order!

2075
01:40:35,397 --> 01:40:36,171
I am here...

2076
01:40:36,231 --> 01:40:37,141
I am here for you...

2077
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:38,404
Please sit down.

2078
01:40:42,336 --> 01:40:46,307
The coun grants time to Jagaavar
Chaudhanj, Arjun Singh and Vinay Sharma...

2079
01:40:46,374 --> 01:40:49,378
...to gather evidence
for corroborating their ston].

2080
01:40:49,444 --> 01:40:52,220
The coun is adjourned
until next hearing.

2081
01:40:55,116 --> 01:40:56,823
All they get is date after date...

2082
01:40:57,085 --> 01:41:00,225
...and their troubles keep adding up.

2083
01:41:01,255 --> 01:41:02,325
Dear...

2084
01:41:02,724 --> 01:41:04,067
Neha?

2085
01:41:04,592 --> 01:41:07,038
What kind of behavior is this?

2086
01:41:07,261 --> 01:41:10,242
You see, since the poster incident...

2087
01:41:10,298 --> 01:41:12,403
...kids at school keep teasing her.

2088
01:41:13,034 --> 01:41:15,378
"O benevolent Lord..."

2089
01:41:15,436 --> 01:41:18,417
"...for the sake of our devotion..."

2090
01:41:18,473 --> 01:41:23,218
"Bless us..."

2091
01:41:24,412 --> 01:41:27,325
"...with Your grace."

2092
01:41:27,382 --> 01:41:30,420
"These feet...sti|| have hope."

2093
01:41:30,485 --> 01:41:35,696
"O Lord...you're our faith..."

2094
01:41:49,637 --> 01:41:55,986
With passing time...it seems
almost impossible to get justice.

2095
01:41:58,579 --> 01:42:06,122
Somewhere far away,
a ray of hope could be seen.

2096
01:42:07,355 --> 01:42:10,029
Sunil, how long will you
keep rejecting marriage proposals?

2097
01:42:10,091 --> 01:42:12,196
Mom, you knowl love Anjali.

2098
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:14,740
Whenever I get married,
It will only be with Anjali.

2099
01:42:16,397 --> 01:42:19,503
And these three, had no clue about it.

2100
01:42:24,038 --> 01:42:25,449
If we had done nothing...

2101
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:28,186
...this matter would've
eventually faded away.

2102
01:42:29,143 --> 01:42:33,148
But now, this blemish on our
reputation will never get cleared.

2103
01:42:33,748 --> 01:42:35,193
No one's going to listen to us...

2104
01:42:35,249 --> 01:42:36,319
No one...

2105
01:42:42,257 --> 01:42:45,204
Teacher, don't lose hope.

2106
01:42:45,693 --> 01:42:48,071
Someone will definitely hear us.

2107
01:42:48,129 --> 01:42:49,472
You're right, Mr. Jagaavar.

2108
01:42:49,531 --> 01:42:51,272
You shouldn't lose hope.

2109
01:42:51,666 --> 01:42:53,475
You will definitely get justice.

2110
01:42:53,534 --> 01:42:56,310
Maybe not on the coun, but you will
get justice in the people's court

2111
01:42:56,504 --> 01:42:58,108
And, I will help you.

2112
01:42:58,172 --> 01:43:00,379
I will take your ston/ to them,
so that...

2113
01:43:00,575 --> 01:43:02,282
...peop|e will find out the truth.

2114
01:43:02,443 --> 01:43:06,255
Look, we don't have money
to pay your commission.

2115
01:43:06,447 --> 01:43:09,121
Mr. Jagaavar, I've earned money...

2116
01:43:09,184 --> 01:43:12,393
Give me this one oppoﬂunity
to earn some respect.

2117
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:20,730
Okay.

2118
01:43:22,129 --> 01:43:24,109
Tomorrow...Press conference.

2119
01:43:28,035 --> 01:43:31,278
So Mr. Chaudhanj,
how will you get justice?

2120
01:43:31,406 --> 01:43:33,079
We'll protest.

2121
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:36,087
We'll go to Gandhi Maidan
(Open-ground) and go on a hunger-strike.

2122
01:43:36,143 --> 01:43:39,090
Chaudhan/ sir, people have
been going on hunger-strikes for ages.

2123
01:43:39,146 --> 01:43:42,093
What are you going to do different...

2124
01:43:42,149 --> 01:43:44,629
...which you think will
convince the government.

2125
01:43:44,685 --> 01:43:47,427
Hey man, get some biscuits for us.

2126
01:43:47,488 --> 01:43:50,526
We're not on a hunger strike.

2127
01:43:51,158 --> 01:43:54,469
Thousands of people like you
go on a hunger-strike even] year.

2128
01:43:54,528 --> 01:43:56,132
They burn effigies ofthe government.

2129
01:43:56,197 --> 01:43:57,301
But what do you think
will be the result?

2130
01:43:57,365 --> 01:43:58,105
Nothing.

2131
01:43:58,166 --> 01:43:59,076
This time it will...

2132
01:43:59,133 --> 01:44:00,578
I am cenain.
- Nothing is going to happen.

2133
01:44:00,635 --> 01:44:02,979
We'll expose the government
in front of even/one.

2134
01:44:03,037 --> 01:44:05,381
Because they stripped
us naked in front of even/one.

2135
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:07,613
And...

2136
01:44:08,076 --> 01:44:10,647
The government exposed us pub|ica|y..
now we will expose them publicly.

2137
01:44:10,712 --> 01:44:12,749
...and now,
we'll strip the government.

2138
01:44:13,014 --> 01:44:14,220
That's what I was saying.

2139
01:44:14,281 --> 01:44:18,286
And so we'll stage this protest...
without wearing any clothes.

2140
01:44:18,353 --> 01:44:19,024
Huh...

2141
01:44:19,086 --> 01:44:19,621
What?

2142
01:44:19,687 --> 01:44:23,032
Will you really strip
off all your clothes.

2143
01:44:23,091 --> 01:44:24,263
You are right brother.

2144
01:44:24,325 --> 01:44:27,135
We'll strip off all our clothes and protest.
- Isn't that a great idea.

2145
01:44:28,596 --> 01:44:31,372
Sir biscuits - Go away,
can't you see this is breaking news.

2146
01:44:31,432 --> 01:44:33,605
And you're worried
about tea and biscuits.

2147
01:44:34,102 --> 01:44:37,276
Mr. Arjun...are you guys really
going to strip off your clothes...

2148
01:44:37,338 --> 01:44:38,408
...and go on a hunger strike?

2149
01:44:38,473 --> 01:44:41,113
When brother said nude,
he means nude.

2150
01:44:41,175 --> 01:44:42,313
Once I make a commitment...

2151
01:44:42,376 --> 01:44:45,357
'|n this age, along with
the truth...

2152
01:44:45,413 --> 01:44:47,222
This is breaking news.

2153
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:49,124
...one also needs sensation.’

2154
01:44:49,183 --> 01:44:50,321
Come to Gandhi Maidan
and see for yourself.

2155
01:44:50,385 --> 01:44:51,591
This is front-page headlines.

2156
01:44:51,653 --> 01:44:53,360
‘That's the truth.’

2157
01:44:53,421 --> 01:44:55,196
...we'|| be totally nude...

2158
01:44:55,423 --> 01:44:57,198
Brother, please stop him.
What is he saying?

2159
01:44:57,258 --> 01:44:59,738
Teacher, better staﬂ
getting into shape. - Why?

2160
01:44:59,794 --> 01:45:03,332
You should look in
shape...when you strip down.

2161
01:45:03,998 --> 01:45:07,343
Mr. Jagaavar, what is Arjun saying...
- He's right.

2162
01:45:07,735 --> 01:45:10,341
Do you think this fight
will benefit you in any way?

2163
01:45:10,405 --> 01:45:13,545
Or, maybe you'll lose whatever
little reputation you have left.

2164
01:45:20,681 --> 01:45:24,561
One who fought on the
battlefield attained martyrdom.

2165
01:45:25,219 --> 01:45:28,632
But, the one who never
fought was already dead.

2166
01:45:29,123 --> 01:45:32,570
In this battle for respect,
we'll face embarrassment.

2167
01:45:33,461 --> 01:45:35,566
But, he who loses
respect for oneself...

2168
01:45:35,729 --> 01:45:37,640
Will have no self-esteem.

2169
01:45:38,466 --> 01:45:40,412
In this crowd of shameless people,

2170
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:42,571
we've made up our mind...

2171
01:45:43,470 --> 01:45:45,472
...even if we've to strip
down to our last piece of cloth...

2172
01:45:46,006 --> 01:45:50,216
...but, we must save our reputation.

2173
01:45:50,277 --> 01:45:52,587
Chaudhan/ sir, fantastic...!

2174
01:45:52,647 --> 01:45:54,354
Amazing...

2175
01:46:06,427 --> 01:46:07,667
Take care...

2176
01:46:29,317 --> 01:46:30,489
Come, brother...

2177
01:46:30,551 --> 01:46:32,189
Brother is here.

2178
01:46:32,253 --> 01:46:33,254
Hello, sir.

2179
01:46:33,321 --> 01:46:36,359
Look at how we decorated the tempo.

2180
01:46:36,423 --> 01:46:37,629
"Let's go to Gandhi Maidan..."

2181
01:46:37,691 --> 01:46:38,465
"Don't lock horns with us,

2182
01:46:38,525 --> 01:46:40,232
cause this is the strip-off protest."

2183
01:46:40,294 --> 01:46:42,399
What do you think
about the decoration?

2184
01:46:42,463 --> 01:46:45,273
Even/thing is fine, but...
I am looking really great.

2185
01:46:47,035 --> 01:46:49,709
Brother, do you know
who owns this vehicle.

2186
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:50,771
Who?

2187
01:46:55,609 --> 01:46:57,054
Sunil!

2188
01:46:57,344 --> 01:46:58,414
Sunil!

2189
01:46:58,479 --> 01:46:59,480
Yes brother.

2190
01:47:02,216 --> 01:47:05,686
Did father give you permission
to come here? - Not yet...

2191
01:47:05,953 --> 01:47:06,988
But he will...

2192
01:47:07,054 --> 01:47:08,658
I have faith in you, brother.

2193
01:47:08,723 --> 01:47:11,363
Let's go... ‘Gandhi maidan'

2194
01:47:11,425 --> 01:47:13,063
"Time to see who's in dire straights."

2195
01:47:13,127 --> 01:47:15,664
"We must fend against
an army of millennial..."

2196
01:47:15,729 --> 01:47:17,436
"...we...naked soldiers..."

2197
01:47:18,332 --> 01:47:20,369
Teacher...

2198
01:47:20,434 --> 01:47:21,742
Amazing, teacher.

2199
01:47:22,003 --> 01:47:24,415
You said that without forgetting.

2200
01:47:24,472 --> 01:47:27,146
Do we take off our shin first or pant?
- Even/one will be stripped naked.

2201
01:47:27,207 --> 01:47:28,117
Let's go.

2202
01:47:33,514 --> 01:47:35,221
So that was the ston/ until now.

2203
01:47:35,283 --> 01:47:37,229
Now, to find out whether
they will get justice today or not...

2204
01:47:37,285 --> 01:47:39,663
...keep watching Tea-vee news.

2205
01:47:40,321 --> 01:47:44,235
Madam, do you have a TV here.
- Yes...7 patients have TB...

2206
01:47:44,291 --> 01:47:45,634
...and the doctors are treating them.

2207
01:47:45,693 --> 01:47:50,142
Not TB, I meant television.
- Oh... yes, we do.

2208
01:47:50,198 --> 01:47:51,074
Then turn it on...

2209
01:47:51,131 --> 01:47:52,633
They're showing the
protest on the news.

2210
01:47:53,067 --> 01:47:53,704
Really?

2211
01:47:54,368 --> 01:47:55,779
Are they showing it on TV?
- Yes.

2212
01:47:56,037 --> 01:47:57,482
Madam, don't take so long.

2213
01:47:57,538 --> 01:47:59,176
Turn it on quickly.
- Yes.

2214
01:48:00,174 --> 01:48:02,085
Hello, ladies and gentlement...
My name is Kishan and...

2215
01:48:02,143 --> 01:48:05,352
I request the citizens
of this countn]...

2216
01:48:05,413 --> 01:48:08,087
...to suppoﬂ us in this
movement and encourage us.

2217
01:48:08,149 --> 01:48:11,187
And, if you feel we're
right then doesn't matter...

2218
01:48:11,251 --> 01:48:12,730
...in which pan
ofthe countn/ you are.

2219
01:48:12,987 --> 01:48:16,434
Just strip off your clothes,
and support us in this movement.

2220
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:18,663
And, take a selfie of
yourself or make a video...

2221
01:48:18,726 --> 01:48:22,401
...and upload it to our
site on 'nangakardegadanga'!

2222
01:48:22,463 --> 01:48:23,999
Jai Hind!

2223
01:48:24,064 --> 01:48:25,202
Jai Hind!

2224
01:48:26,166 --> 01:48:27,201
Nice...

2225
01:48:27,268 --> 01:48:30,112
Even] Tom-Dick-Harn/ is heading
to Gandhi Maidan these days.

2226
01:48:31,438 --> 01:48:34,647
Now Arjun will say a few words
about the ‘Nude Movement’.

2227
01:48:36,744 --> 01:48:38,155
But there are hardly any people here.

2228
01:48:38,479 --> 01:48:40,117
Arjun, more will come.

2229
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:41,315
You speak.

2230
01:48:44,685 --> 01:48:46,460
"Drums beating..."

2231
01:48:49,590 --> 01:48:54,061
"Drums beating...at even] step...."

2232
01:48:54,128 --> 01:48:55,698
"At even] step..."

2233
01:48:56,997 --> 01:48:59,273
"Drums beating...at even] step...."

2234
01:48:59,333 --> 01:49:05,306
"Drums beating...at even] step...."

2235
01:49:05,373 --> 01:49:07,148
Look at that, what's going on?

2236
01:49:07,207 --> 01:49:08,277
Will these guys really
strip off their clothes?

2237
01:49:08,342 --> 01:49:09,480
They will have to.

2238
01:49:09,543 --> 01:49:11,580
Do you think it's true?
- Seems like it.

2239
01:49:11,645 --> 01:49:13,249
Let's go.

2240
01:49:15,149 --> 01:49:19,529
And now...
- Look! More people are coming.

2241
01:49:20,521 --> 01:49:22,432
"Drums beating..."
- Yes, brother.

2242
01:49:25,393 --> 01:49:26,667
"Drums beating..."

2243
01:49:28,729 --> 01:49:30,174
Brother.

2244
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:34,508
"Drums beating...at even] step...."

2245
01:49:34,568 --> 01:49:36,343
"At even] step..."

2246
01:49:37,004 --> 01:49:39,177
Sir, more people are joining
the crowd.

2247
01:49:43,443 --> 01:49:46,253
Wait for my next call.

2248
01:49:46,446 --> 01:49:48,517
Teacher, you were amazing.

2249
01:49:48,582 --> 01:49:50,721
Mister, we've heard
enough of your speeches.

2250
01:49:50,985 --> 01:49:53,363
But when are you going
to take your clothes off?

2251
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:55,229
Because...peop|e want to know.

2252
01:49:55,289 --> 01:49:57,132
Why, brother?
- He's so restless.

2253
01:49:57,191 --> 01:50:00,536
And now, the creator ofthis moment,
Arjun Singh...

2254
01:50:00,594 --> 01:50:03,370
...wi|| take off his clothes
and staﬂ this protest.

2255
01:50:14,575 --> 01:50:17,146
Mom, give me your phone.
- Here.

2256
01:50:17,211 --> 01:50:21,250
"Arjun pick the phone".
- Give me my phone.

2257
01:50:23,017 --> 01:50:23,620
Yes baby say.

2258
01:50:23,684 --> 01:50:28,224
Arjun, I am watching you.
- Where? How are you watching me?

2259
01:50:28,288 --> 01:50:29,358
I'll settle your installments.

2260
01:50:29,423 --> 01:50:30,663
On TV...where else?

2261
01:50:30,725 --> 01:50:32,727
Why are you feeling so embarrassed
to take off your clothes?

2262
01:50:32,793 --> 01:50:33,794
No...

2263
01:50:34,261 --> 01:50:35,331
You...

2264
01:50:36,497 --> 01:50:38,568
look really sexy without the clothes.

2265
01:50:38,632 --> 01:50:40,612
My Arjun Singh...
take your shin off...

2266
01:50:40,667 --> 01:50:42,271
and surprise even/one.

2267
01:50:42,336 --> 01:50:43,781
What are you saying, baby.

2268
01:50:44,038 --> 01:50:46,348
I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

2269
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:54,253
Total nude.

2270
01:50:55,315 --> 01:50:57,124
Wow brother, what a pose.

2271
01:50:57,184 --> 01:51:01,997
Take off the jacket,
can't do it without taking it off.

2272
01:51:10,163 --> 01:51:12,074
Aniket...
- Yes?

2273
01:51:13,067 --> 01:51:14,273
Upload the videos.

2274
01:51:14,335 --> 01:51:15,143
Ok.

2275
01:51:15,569 --> 01:51:18,049
Brother...videos?

2276
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:21,049
We made a couple of
people take off their shin...

2277
01:51:21,108 --> 01:51:22,712
...and made a video.

2278
01:51:22,776 --> 01:51:24,312
To suppoﬂ this protest.

2279
01:51:24,378 --> 01:51:28,053
We're going to upload
those on our social media.

2280
01:51:28,549 --> 01:51:30,290
But, brother...

2281
01:51:31,318 --> 01:51:34,060
Sometimes in order
to expose a big truth...

2282
01:51:34,121 --> 01:51:36,761
...there's nothing wrong
with telling small lies.

2283
01:51:38,292 --> 01:51:41,102
As soon as Arjun Singh
took off his clothes...

2284
01:51:41,161 --> 01:51:43,607
...peop|e from different pans ofthe
countn/ took their clothes off too...

2285
01:51:43,664 --> 01:51:45,166
...and uploaded their videos.

2286
01:51:45,232 --> 01:51:46,506
Shall we call Hari Singh now?

2287
01:51:51,805 --> 01:51:54,445
Hari.. you know right,
what you need to do?

2288
01:51:54,508 --> 01:51:56,112
Consider it done...

2289
01:51:56,376 --> 01:51:57,548
Yeah, I am on my way there.

2290
01:52:15,562 --> 01:52:19,374
So as you can see, this nude
protest is not just a protest...

2291
01:52:19,433 --> 01:52:22,437
...but, it's a slap
on the government's face.

2292
01:52:24,338 --> 01:52:27,410
What's going on?
- Sir, it's the nude movement.

2293
01:52:27,641 --> 01:52:30,645
What? Nude movement?

2294
01:52:30,711 --> 01:52:34,284
There's a nude movement at Gandhi
Maidan, I was just watching that.

2295
01:52:34,348 --> 01:52:36,555
The Poster Boys have
stripped off their clothes...

2296
01:52:36,617 --> 01:52:38,392
...and begun this revolution.

2297
01:52:38,452 --> 01:52:40,363
But the government is still quiet.

2298
01:52:40,421 --> 01:52:42,367
And now, to take this protest ahead...

2299
01:52:42,422 --> 01:52:44,800
...teacher Vinay Sharma of Jangethi
will take his clothes off next.

2300
01:52:46,393 --> 01:52:48,066
Teacher, take your clothes off...

2301
01:52:51,265 --> 01:52:53,245
Teacher, take your clothes off...

2302
01:52:55,102 --> 01:52:57,412
Don't be scared teacher,
take your clothes off.

2303
01:52:57,471 --> 01:52:58,643
I am.

2304
01:52:58,705 --> 01:53:01,049
I don't come to such
protests even] day.

2305
01:53:07,148 --> 01:53:09,287
He's a Sharma and
still not feeling shy...

2306
01:53:09,349 --> 01:53:10,692
...and you're a Dubey,
why are you feeling so embarrassed.

2307
01:53:10,751 --> 01:53:12,355
Sharmaji.

2308
01:53:12,686 --> 01:53:14,097
"Drums beating..."

2309
01:53:15,722 --> 01:53:17,463
Sharmaji.

2310
01:53:17,524 --> 01:53:18,764
"Drums beating..."

2311
01:53:22,396 --> 01:53:24,433
The teacher is a real hero.

2312
01:53:24,498 --> 01:53:26,603
One needs guts to
do something like this.

2313
01:53:26,667 --> 01:53:27,441
Isn't that true?

2314
01:53:27,501 --> 01:53:28,673
I agree with you.

2315
01:53:28,736 --> 01:53:30,010
Why don't you show some guts too?

2316
01:53:30,070 --> 01:53:31,208
Take off your shin.

2317
01:53:34,074 --> 01:53:37,180
Poster Boys...we're with you.

2318
01:53:39,246 --> 01:53:41,192
We only had 2-3 videos.

2319
01:53:41,248 --> 01:53:43,751
Are people really
sending these videos?

2320
01:53:44,017 --> 01:53:44,722
Yes...

2321
01:53:45,052 --> 01:53:46,759
You're getting the
suppoﬂ ofthe people.

2322
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:47,691
Who is behind them?

2323
01:53:47,754 --> 01:53:49,597
I don't think anyone is behind them.

2324
01:53:50,257 --> 01:53:52,134
But people are joining them.

2325
01:53:52,492 --> 01:53:54,768
Call even/one from
the Health Depaﬂment...

2326
01:53:55,028 --> 01:53:56,371
...who are involved. Quickly.

2327
01:53:56,430 --> 01:53:57,306
Okay sir.

2328
01:53:58,232 --> 01:53:59,609
Along with the Minister.

2329
01:54:02,503 --> 01:54:05,382
Mr. Jagaavar, take your
clothes off...it's your turn now.

2330
01:54:05,439 --> 01:54:09,012
Jaagavar sir, take your clothes off.
We're with you.

2331
01:54:09,076 --> 01:54:12,523
Long live Chaudhan/ sir.

2332
01:54:53,353 --> 01:54:55,162
What are you doing?

2333
01:54:55,589 --> 01:54:56,795
Nothing...

2334
01:54:57,357 --> 01:55:00,031
It's really hot out here.

2335
01:55:11,271 --> 01:55:13,717
The government hasn't
taken any action on this case.

2336
01:55:14,107 --> 01:55:16,144
And now, Arjun Singh
is taking off his pant.

2337
01:55:16,209 --> 01:55:20,385
Don't lock horns,
this is the nude movement.

2338
01:55:22,349 --> 01:55:23,521
Riya.

2339
01:55:23,584 --> 01:55:25,393
Madam, she's in pain.

2340
01:55:25,452 --> 01:55:26,658
Please take a look.
- I see...

2341
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:29,223
Someone call the doctor, quickly.
- But, you're the doctor.

2342
01:55:29,289 --> 01:55:30,267
Me...
- Huh

2343
01:55:30,323 --> 01:55:32,360
Oh yes.
- Please, take a look.

2344
01:55:32,425 --> 01:55:34,462
Did it have to happen now?

2345
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:38,374
Good going, Chaudhan/ sir.

2346
01:55:41,535 --> 01:55:44,175
Now, teacher Vinay Sharma
will take off his pants.

2347
01:55:44,771 --> 01:55:47,217
Teacher, take it off.

2348
01:55:55,215 --> 01:55:56,558
What happened to him?

2349
01:55:56,617 --> 01:55:59,427
Soorajmukhi, is even/thing okay?
- Yes, teacher.

2350
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:00,658
There's still time.

2351
01:56:00,721 --> 01:56:04,498
And listen, all the best.
- All the best to you too, Soorajmukhi.

2352
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:05,993
Don't worn]...

2353
01:56:06,326 --> 01:56:08,067
This time it's going to be a boy.

2354
01:56:09,463 --> 01:56:12,103
It's not right to discriminate
between girl and boy.

2355
01:56:12,165 --> 01:56:14,111
Didn't you always tell me that?

2356
01:56:14,535 --> 01:56:16,708
I get it now...
- Really, Soorajmukhi?

2357
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:17,539
Honestly.

2358
01:56:18,205 --> 01:56:21,209
And yes, I suppoﬂ you in your fight.

2359
01:56:21,575 --> 01:56:23,316
As well as our unborn child.

2360
01:56:23,477 --> 01:56:26,481
Whether it's a girl or a boy.

2361
01:56:26,547 --> 01:56:28,185
I love you, Soorajmukhi.

2362
01:56:28,248 --> 01:56:29,318
I love you.

2363
01:56:33,019 --> 01:56:33,759
Brother.

2364
01:56:34,021 --> 01:56:34,761
Catch!

2365
01:56:43,296 --> 01:56:44,331
Sorn/ sir.

2366
01:56:47,167 --> 01:56:51,513
Excellent teacher...
You're amazing...

2367
01:56:51,571 --> 01:56:54,142
Poster Boys... we are with you!

2368
01:56:54,208 --> 01:56:58,418
About Poster Boys?
Go ahead Poster Boys We are with you!

2369
01:57:02,182 --> 01:57:04,287
I suppoﬂ the Poster Boys
in their movement.

2370
01:57:04,351 --> 01:57:07,696
They are doing the right thing, even
I suppoﬂ them by taking my clothes off.

2371
01:57:09,122 --> 01:57:12,501
My name is Arshad Warsi... if you want
your clothes stripped off or turn, call me.

2372
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:14,733
All the best go for it.

2373
01:57:15,162 --> 01:57:18,609
Poster Boys,
don't worn]... we are with you!

2374
01:57:18,699 --> 01:57:21,202
We love you Poster Boys!

2375
01:57:21,268 --> 01:57:24,078
Did they really get
a vasectomy done or...

2376
01:57:26,139 --> 01:57:29,245
No point in hiding it from me now.

2377
01:57:29,543 --> 01:57:33,218
I can help you only
if you tell me even/thing.

2378
01:57:34,448 --> 01:57:38,055
Sir, actually they
didn't get a vasectomy done.

2379
01:57:39,319 --> 01:57:42,061
Actually, it was their fault...

2380
01:57:42,122 --> 01:57:43,567
...that their pictures got published.

2381
01:57:44,591 --> 01:57:48,471
Sir, it's such a small mistake...
- Sir, please don't worn].

2382
01:57:48,728 --> 01:57:51,436
I'll take care of them.

2383
01:57:51,498 --> 01:57:54,274
Sir, I'll manage.
- Manage?

2384
01:57:54,668 --> 01:57:57,308
These people are standing
on our heads now...

2385
01:57:57,371 --> 01:57:58,782
...and how did you manage?

2386
01:57:59,039 --> 01:58:03,044
Sir, I...
- I worked really hard for this post...

2387
01:58:03,310 --> 01:58:05,381
...and now, I can't depend on you.

2388
01:58:06,146 --> 01:58:07,250
Manage?

2389
01:58:09,582 --> 01:58:11,255
I'll have to do something.

2390
01:58:12,986 --> 01:58:15,091
They have the public on their side.

2391
01:58:17,157 --> 01:58:20,730
Now, we must win these
people over to our side.

2392
01:58:21,428 --> 01:58:25,103
I'll show them what's the real power.

2393
01:58:25,365 --> 01:58:29,370
They have no clue about a CM's power.

2394
01:58:31,471 --> 01:58:32,643
Get the force ready.

2395
01:58:40,113 --> 01:58:42,320
He||o...Aniket...

2396
01:58:43,383 --> 01:58:46,023
Brother, you've managed
to gather a really big crowd.

2397
01:58:46,086 --> 01:58:48,760
Yes, brother, you were fantastic.

2398
01:58:49,022 --> 01:58:51,059
I only staﬂed a movement...

2399
01:58:51,124 --> 01:58:53,502
But you know, people know even/thing.

2400
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:56,006
Jagaavar sir... Jagaavar sir.

2401
01:58:56,363 --> 01:58:57,603
CM sir is coming.

2402
01:58:57,664 --> 01:58:58,540
Isee...

2403
01:58:58,599 --> 01:59:00,476
You mean he's accepted?

2404
01:59:00,534 --> 01:59:03,037
No, he's coming with his entire force.

2405
01:59:04,571 --> 01:59:06,448
Will they shoot us?

2406
01:59:06,506 --> 01:59:07,610
No...

2407
01:59:07,674 --> 01:59:11,247
They can't do that in
front of such a huge crowd.

2408
01:59:11,411 --> 01:59:14,585
Maybe they will just arrest us.
- Yeah...

2409
01:59:15,015 --> 01:59:17,393
And later shoot us.
- Brother...

2410
01:59:17,517 --> 01:59:20,293
You mean our plan
will eventually fail...

2411
01:59:20,453 --> 01:59:21,261
brother...

2412
01:59:21,321 --> 01:59:22,732
Don't be scared.

2413
01:59:22,990 --> 01:59:23,593
Let him come...

2414
01:59:24,024 --> 01:59:25,002
We'll see...

2415
01:59:27,628 --> 01:59:29,574
Chief Minister Down-Down.

2416
01:59:29,629 --> 01:59:32,132
Chief Minister Down-Down.

2417
01:59:34,734 --> 01:59:38,272
Long live...
- Poster boys.

2418
01:59:38,338 --> 01:59:40,284
Brother, he's here.

2419
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:41,550
Step back, brother.

2420
01:59:41,608 --> 01:59:44,612
Chief Minister Down-Down.

2421
01:59:44,678 --> 01:59:48,387
Chief Minister Down-Down.

2422
01:59:49,683 --> 01:59:52,323
Long live...
- Poster boys.

2423
01:59:52,386 --> 01:59:55,629
Long live...
- Poster boys.

2424
01:59:55,655 --> 01:59:59,330
Chief Minister Down-Down.

2425
02:00:25,518 --> 02:00:27,259
What did you guys think?

2426
02:00:27,788 --> 02:00:29,768
That you will tn/ to
go against the government...

2427
02:00:30,724 --> 02:00:32,567
...and the government will stay idle.

2428
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:35,164
But, you were wrong.

2429
02:00:37,330 --> 02:00:39,276
Brother,
God knows what he's going to say.

2430
02:00:39,333 --> 02:00:43,076
These people are protesting
against the government...

2431
02:00:43,136 --> 02:00:44,672
...and you are all supponing them.

2432
02:00:44,738 --> 02:00:45,341
Why?

2433
02:00:45,405 --> 02:00:47,180
Because they are not wrong!

2434
02:00:50,710 --> 02:00:53,452
We believe them, they have been wrong.

2435
02:00:55,582 --> 02:00:57,061
Okay..okay.

2436
02:00:58,552 --> 02:01:01,624
Until now you only heard
the Poster Boys side ofthe ston].

2437
02:01:01,755 --> 02:01:04,565
But now,
I am going tell you the truth.

2438
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:08,430
Truth?

2439
02:01:09,429 --> 02:01:10,271
Call him.

2440
02:01:10,330 --> 02:01:11,308
Yes sir.

2441
02:01:11,365 --> 02:01:12,241
Balwant...

2442
02:01:12,299 --> 02:01:13,471
Come up and tell them the truth.

2443
02:01:13,533 --> 02:01:15,274
Madam, don't worn].

2444
02:01:15,535 --> 02:01:17,139
Hello...

2445
02:01:20,173 --> 02:01:21,117
Hello...

2446
02:01:21,174 --> 02:01:22,744
I will tell you the truth.

2447
02:01:23,209 --> 02:01:28,420
The truth is that these three visited the
sterilization camp in Jangethi village.

2448
02:01:28,482 --> 02:01:29,620
Yes...

2449
02:01:29,683 --> 02:01:32,289
It's okay.

2450
02:01:33,753 --> 02:01:37,166
And these three willingly...

2451
02:01:40,727 --> 02:01:41,762
And another one.

2452
02:01:42,028 --> 02:01:44,167
I asked you to tell the truth...

2453
02:01:44,231 --> 02:01:47,303
...and the truth is that you
should be stripped off your clothes.

2454
02:01:47,367 --> 02:01:48,641
Not them.

2455
02:01:49,135 --> 02:01:52,344
You shou|d've been exposed, not them.

2456
02:01:52,406 --> 02:01:54,579
It's entirely your fault, not them.

2457
02:01:54,641 --> 02:01:55,483
Move!

2458
02:01:56,509 --> 02:01:57,419
Get out!

2459
02:01:57,777 --> 02:01:58,755
Get out!

2460
02:02:01,381 --> 02:02:05,488
The truth is that it is entirely
the Health Department's mistake.

2461
02:02:06,119 --> 02:02:07,462
Yeah...

2462
02:02:09,489 --> 02:02:11,025
And these three are innocent.

2463
02:02:13,493 --> 02:02:16,064
We won...we won.

2464
02:02:16,997 --> 02:02:22,106
As the Chief Minister of the state,
I apologize to them publicly.

2465
02:02:24,137 --> 02:02:26,083
Long Live Poster Boys!

2466
02:02:26,139 --> 02:02:27,516
Long Live Poster Boys!

2467
02:02:27,574 --> 02:02:31,750
But, there is one thing I would
like to bring to your attention.

2468
02:02:32,012 --> 02:02:35,289
Men's mentality!

2469
02:02:38,184 --> 02:02:42,599
Only women should
get a vasectomy done, not men.

2470
02:02:43,290 --> 02:02:43,791
Why?

2471
02:02:44,791 --> 02:02:46,668
Does that make him any less a man?

2472
02:02:47,160 --> 02:02:48,503
Who told you that?

2473
02:02:48,628 --> 02:02:49,800
Doctor?

2474
02:02:50,597 --> 02:02:52,702
What is manhood?

2475
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:54,774
Toﬂuring women!

2476
02:02:55,035 --> 02:02:56,105
No, no.

2477
02:02:56,169 --> 02:02:58,649
Enduring the cruelty
you're subjugated to?

2478
02:02:59,439 --> 02:03:01,214
No! Never!

2479
02:03:01,508 --> 02:03:03,181
Real manhood is about...

2480
02:03:03,243 --> 02:03:06,383
...giving women equal rights as men.

2481
02:03:07,214 --> 02:03:10,354
Raising your voice
against the cruelty on you.

2482
02:03:12,152 --> 02:03:17,431
And I am proud that there are
three men like them in our state...

2483
02:03:19,225 --> 02:03:23,640
...who raised their voice
against the cruelty against them.

2484
02:03:23,697 --> 02:03:26,007
And shoot the government.

2485
02:03:26,366 --> 02:03:32,476
I apologize to them again.
- No, sir...no...

2486
02:03:32,539 --> 02:03:38,717
And also announce Rupees <i>2</i> Lacs
to each person as compensation.

2487
02:03:44,617 --> 02:03:47,723
"Arjun pick the phone."

2488
02:03:47,788 --> 02:03:50,268
"| missed you and called you up."

2489
02:03:50,523 --> 02:03:54,665
Baby, CM sirjust declared
that we're innocent.

2490
02:03:55,094 --> 02:03:57,506
Better te|| your father,
if he creates any problems now...

2491
02:03:57,564 --> 02:03:59,475
I will set his installments.

2492
02:03:59,532 --> 02:04:03,241
No, son...there's
no need for that now.

2493
02:04:03,670 --> 02:04:04,705
Father...

2494
02:04:04,971 --> 02:04:07,645
Forgive me, I...
- I get it.

2495
02:04:08,141 --> 02:04:09,711
And soon, you will understand...

2496
02:04:10,277 --> 02:04:13,281
...what it means to
be the father of a girl.

2497
02:04:13,346 --> 02:04:14,381
What?

2498
02:04:14,447 --> 02:04:16,620
I mean you've become a father.

2499
02:04:16,683 --> 02:04:18,685
Riya's given bir1h to a girl.

2500
02:04:19,386 --> 02:04:20,524
Really?
- What...

2501
02:04:20,587 --> 02:04:21,657
I've become a father.

2502
02:04:21,721 --> 02:04:24,099
I've become a father.

2503
02:04:24,758 --> 02:04:26,396
I've become a father.

2504
02:04:26,459 --> 02:04:28,302
I've become a father.

2505
02:04:28,361 --> 02:04:29,738
Congratulations.

2506
02:04:30,196 --> 02:04:33,666
My phone.

2507
02:04:34,634 --> 02:04:36,307
Hello, Soorajmukhi. What happened?

2508
02:04:36,369 --> 02:04:38,542
Guess...what could it be?

2509
02:04:38,605 --> 02:04:39,583
Boy?

2510
02:04:41,341 --> 02:04:43,343
It's a beautiful daughter.

2511
02:04:43,409 --> 02:04:44,410
She's really cute.

2512
02:04:44,644 --> 02:04:46,123
Just like you.

2513
02:04:46,379 --> 02:04:49,019
Come back soon...we're
waiting for you.

2514
02:04:49,082 --> 02:04:51,062
I am coming. I am coming.

2515
02:04:51,117 --> 02:04:53,529
Even Soorajmukhi gave
bir1h to a daughter.

2516
02:04:57,523 --> 02:04:59,696
Sir..

Mr. Kulbhushan, you?
- Mr. Jagaavar, forgive me.

2519
02:05:17,076 --> 02:05:18,111
I made a mistake.

2520
02:05:27,554 --> 02:05:28,396
Sunil?

2521
02:05:28,455 --> 02:05:30,128
Give me your blessings.

2522
02:05:35,729 --> 02:05:39,142
Friends, you all know that...

2523
02:05:39,199 --> 02:05:42,203
...we never got this operation done.

2524
02:05:44,671 --> 02:05:51,486
But, I would like to announce
on behalf of my friends and me...

2525
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:56,056
...that as soon as we return home,
we'll get this operation done.

2526
02:05:56,115 --> 02:05:57,355
Yes.

2528
02:05:58,551 --> 02:05:59,393

2529
02:05:59,452 --> 02:06:02,331

02:06:02,555 --> 02:06:05,297
Come on...don't be scared.

What the countn/ needs today...

2533
02:06:12,499 --> 02:06:16,675
is population control.

2534
02:06:18,671 --> 02:06:22,278

02:06:26,479 --> 02:06:28,686

And action.

2543
02:07:01,047 --> 02:07:03,391
They look like a bunch of fools,
but they have a generous heart

2544
02:07:05,685 --> 02:07:08,188
"As I set out all decked up"

2545
02:07:08,254 --> 02:07:10,291
"Looking handsome and charming"
