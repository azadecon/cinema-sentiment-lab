1
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33.791
Gosh, your obsession with skiing!

2
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35.833
I have only two vices.

3
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37.541
What's the other one?

4
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40.250
You!

5
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51.291
So, you're going to
climb up that mountain to ski?

6
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54.791
Up.. then down.. and
then up again.

7
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:55.833
Nope!

8
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58.541
Our resort is on that mountain.

9
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01.000
I'll be going further ahead to ski.

10
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03.500
Higher up.

11
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07.500
No more skiing vacations
after we get married.

12
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10.750
After the wedding, our vacations
will be something else altogether.

13
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13.291
How come?

14
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:15.791
Wait and watch.

15
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:34.791
"I'll become the rain,
you'll become the clouds."

16
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37.375
"Wait and watch.."

17
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40.583
"Wait and watch.."

18
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:47.500
"I'll love you so much
that you'll go crazy."

19
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50.041
"Wait and watch.."

20
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53.041
"Wait and watch.."

21
00:03:54,916 --> 00:04:01.125
"The rays of the
morning sun declare.."

22
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:06.000
"..I'm yours in every respect."

23
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09.625
"Wait and watch.."

24
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15.708
"I'll forever be
the smile on your lips."

25
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18.625
"Wait and watch.."

26
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:22.208
"Wait and watch.."

27
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25.500
"When your eyes turn moist.."

28
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:31.000
"..I'll flow from them,
wait and watch."

29
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48.625
"Everybody has a heart."

30
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51.708
"But mine is full of love.."

31
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:56.458
"..more than all others,
wait and watch."

32
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:04.375
"I'll carve you
in the lines of my fate."

33
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09.750
"It's my promise to you,
wait and watch."

34
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16.791
"The rays
of the morning sun declare.."

35
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21.875
"..I'm yours in every respect."

36
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:25.291
"Wait and watch.."

37
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:31.458
"I'll forever be
the smile on your lips."

38
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33.875
"Wait and watch.."

39
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37.875
"Wait and watch.."

40
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:41.083
"When your eyes turn moist.."

41
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:46.666
"..I'll flow from them,
wait and watch."

42
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:52.750
Yes, dad?

43
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55.083
Has Amar returned?

44
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:56.916
No, dad.

45
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59.750
The weather's getting worse too.

46
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01.166
I'm his father.

47
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03.833
I've put up with his
habits since he was a kid.

48
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:04.833
Now it's your turn.

49
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07.958
I'm a little scared now, dad.

50
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10.291
I'll call you later.

51
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:11.958
Ok.

52
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37.416
It's just a stupid mountain.
Why can't they find him?

53
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39.750
Though he doesn't say it,
but dad's worried too.

54
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:45.375
Taran, don't worry.
It's Amar after all.

55
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46.833
You know him, nah!

56
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49.333
He may come late,
but he'll definitely come.

57
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:58.708
Papa..

58
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02.500
No need to worry, Manpreet.
He will come back.

59
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03.500
Where else will he go?

60
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05.291
Yeah, of course. Where can he go?

61
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08.666
I am going only because
Taran's all alone out there.

62
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10.291
- See you.
- Ok, call me.

63
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11.458
Yes. I will.

64
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13.416
Ok. Bye.

65
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:09.333
"We were together, we were close."

66
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15.083
"I wonder where our
paths separated."

67
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:20.875
"The place where no path goes.."

68
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:26.250
"..that's the one you chose."

69
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:37.666
"We were together, we were close."

70
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:43.791
"I wonder where our paths separated."

71
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:49.208
"But a place where no path goes.."

72
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:54.333
"..that's the one you chose."

73
00:11:54,958 --> 00:12:00.666
"O beloved, living without you.."

74
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:05.625
"..every breath pricks my heart."

75
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:14.833
"Without you.. I cannot exist."

76
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:26.166
"Without you.. I cannot live."

77
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:36.750
"Without you.. I cannot exist."

78
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:48.041
"Without you.. I cannot live."

79
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:07.833
Nine days we've searched,
we looked everywhere.

80
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:19.750
If..If we find the body,
we will call you.

81
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22.750
For now, I suggest you go home.

82
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27.708
I am so very sorry, he must be dead.

83
00:13:53,416 --> 00:14:04.750
"Alas! This daily dilemma
that refuses to die down."

84
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:16.000
"As if something very dear,
has been misplaced and forgotten."

85
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19.250
"You were here.."

86
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22.083
"Yes, right here.."

87
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:27.458
"..but now you're lost."

88
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:33.083
"O beloved, living without you.."

89
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:37.833
"..every breath pricks my heart."

90
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:46.666
"Without you.. I cannot exist."

91
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:57.791
"Without you.. I cannot live."

92
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:34.125
"Without you.. I cannot live."

93
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:43.833
"Without you.. I cannot live."

94
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:53.291
"It seems, without you.."

95
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58.833
"..I can't live anymore."

96
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04.708
"The shattered pieces within.."

97
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:10.125
"..I cannot explain."

98
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13.291
"Come back now.."

99
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:20.750
"Why nurse a grudge against me?"

100
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:27.583
"O beloved, living without you.."

101
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32.500
"..every breath pricks my heart."

102
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:41.666
"Without you.. I cannot exist."

103
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:53.041
"Without you.. I cannot live."

104
00:16:55,416 --> 00:17:04.166
"Without you.. I cannot exist."

105
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:15.958
"Without you.. I cannot live."

106
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31.458
When you feel like crying,
cry out loud.

107
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37.208
And when you feel love, give a hug.

108
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39.666
These are the only
two realities of life.

109
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20.666
Years later..

110
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24.791
..I went to office today.

111
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27.541
Got some work done too.

112
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:34.000
In the beginning, when I started the
gallery there were many instances..

113
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:37.791
..when I thought I might
have to shut down the gallery.

114
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39.291
Thank you, papa.

115
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41.750
Like it often happens in any business.

116
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:47.166
But it's been 30 years now.

117
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49.708
The gallery is still up and running.

118
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53.791
Nothing stops..

119
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57.333
..if it's done with a good intention.

120
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59.416
That's enough, thank you.

121
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:05.708
How is it?

122
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08.000
Delicious, like always.

123
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16.500
For 6 months, I sat
alone in this house..

124
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19.750
..and thought about Amar.

125
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23.083
Sometimes I would cry.

126
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:32.041
As a kid,
when he was just learning to walk..

127
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36.166
..he would often fall down,
like all kids do.

128
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:42.750
I would rush to pick him up,
as if I had hurt myself.

129
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47.458
And Urvashi would laugh at me.

130
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49.750
She would say, 'let him fall'.

131
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:56.333
'He'll learn to walk..
..and to deal with his pain.'

132
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58.500
I would often quarrel with her.

133
00:19:58,666 --> 00:19:59.833
Saying..

134
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04.083
'We can at least
save him some of the pain'.

135
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08.875
But she was very sensible.

136
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13.458
Do you know what she would say?

137
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18.333
'Every life has its
own share of pain.'

138
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23.375
'The sooner you learn to conquer it,
the better.'

139
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28.541
'How long do you
think you can help him?'

140
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:33.833
She was right.

141
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40.083
For three months, she battled
with her pain in the hospital.

142
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43.750
I couldn't save her from her pain.

143
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51.833
And I couldn't save
Amar from his pain either.

144
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04.000
Anyway..

145
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09.041
..he must have dealt with his pain.

146
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14.875
We need to deal with
our pain too, dear.

147
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19.791
I've thought of something, dear.

148
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11.125
Look dear..

149
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:18.083
..we can either keep crying
for years to come and wait for him.

150
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:24.750
Weave thousands of stories,
saying, 'maybe this..or maybe that'.

151
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29.541
Or we can admit the truth.

152
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33.750
Admit the truth, dear.

153
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:40.041
I've already given
up all hope regarding Amar.

154
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45.750
That's what I called
to tell you, dear.

155
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:51.250
And I wanted to request
you personally, dear..

156
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:58.791
..that let us together, let Amar go.

157
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:01.875
Let him go.

158
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:08.458
He was supposed to be
with us for only this long.

159
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:30.583
Hi, dad.

160
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:31.666
Come, son.

161
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:35.208
I thought I'll take you out.

162
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39.125
Come, dear.

163
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43.750
This is Taran.

164
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:44.916
Shekhar.

165
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46.041
- Hi.
- Hi.

166
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50.791
I'll take your leave now, father.

167
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55.083
You didn't bring your car.
Shall I call a cab?

168
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:57.083
No, papa. I brought my cycle.

169
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:58.750
Can I drop you?

170
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:02.041
No thank you.
I'll really be fine, papa.

171
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:02.916
Okay.

172
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15.541
See you, papa.

173
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:16.916
- Bye.
- Bye.

174
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:21.458
"All hope, all desires seem
to have vanished in thin air.."

175
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:32.458
"All hope, all desires seem
to have vanished in thin air.."

176
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:43.750
"As if your unfulfilled
desire lies buried in me.."

177
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:54.833
"As if a lifetime has
passed while I lay awake.."

178
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:05.500
"As if a lifetime has
passed while I lay awake.."

179
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:17.000
"All hope, all desires seem
to have vanished in thin air.."

180
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:50.041
Enough, Gurpreet.

181
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51.958
No girl from our family
is going to Pakistan.

182
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:54.458
Who's going to Pakistan?
He lives right here in Edinburgh.

183
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56.083
But he's a Pakistani after all.

184
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:56.958
But I like him.

185
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:58.333
You even liked that stupid guy.

186
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:00.541
- What was his name, Taran?
- Randy.

187
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:02.791
Enough, whether he's
Pakistani or Afganistani.

188
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:04.583
You won't find someone like him.

189
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:07.083
You should be worrying about
yourself, I've plenty of options.

190
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:07.916
I see..

191
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:10.625
Then what about him?

192
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11.791
He's too cute.

193
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:15.500
By the way, my guy isn't just cute.

194
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:18.166
He's good looking too.

195
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:20.916
I said no means no. Twisty.

196
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:22.625
Don't call me Twisty.

197
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:24.000
You're always hitting me.

198
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:26.375
Twisty. Let's see you escape today.

199
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:27.708
Take that. And that.

200
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:28.833
Move.. Move..

201
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:30.875
Take that.

202
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:33.291
Twisty! Twisty!

203
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:36.666
- Hi, papa.
- Hello, papa!

204
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:37.958
Hi.

205
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:40.250
This is how life should be..happy.

206
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:45.041
- Hello, papa.
- Hello, dear.

207
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:49.291
I am sorry, but I brought
a guest along uninformed.

208
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51.458
He's the son of my friend.

209
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:55.000
His father passed away.

210
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:58.458
Since then he's been lonely,
always wandering around.

211
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:00.125
- How are you, dear?
- Fine.

212
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:01.291
Come, Shekhar.

213
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:02.416
Hi!

214
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04.500
Meet the charming Kaurs.

215
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:06.250
Manpreet, the eldest of the lot.

216
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:07.458
- Hi.
- Hi.

217
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:08.791
- Gurpreet.
- Hi.

218
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:10.375
- Taran.
- Taran, of course.

219
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:11.166
Hi, Taran.

220
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:12.583
- You've met her.
- Yes.

221
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:14.083
And this is Navjot.

222
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:16.333
For the past three
years, he's convinced..

223
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:18.500
..that he'll marry Manpreet.

224
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:22.083
It was Manpreet's birthday yesterday.

225
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23.416
But we've been invited
to dinner today.

226
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:24.166
I see..

227
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26.791
- Wish you a belated happy birthday.
- Thank you.

228
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:29.541
Sorry, I didn't know.
I showed up empty-handed.

229
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:30.791
I owe you a gift.

230
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:32.541
Not at all, please.

231
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:33.750
Have a seat.

232
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:34.791
Take a seat everyone.

233
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:36.916
I'll finish up first
and then we can chat.

234
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:37.791
Yeah..

235
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:39.666
I've already finished my chores.

236
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:41.750
I'll be done with mine in 10 minutes.

237
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:44.625
Navjot and Taran,
you guys go get the cake.

238
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47.375
Let me first pour papa a drink.
Then we can go.

239
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:48.583
Can I go get the cake?

240
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:50.458
And you guys can finish up by then.

241
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:52.750
Actually, I'll come along too.

242
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:54.291
These guys are such drama-queens.

243
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55.500
They're very choosy about the flavour.

244
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:57.458
No-no..what are you saying, Gurpreet?

245
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:59.083
How can our guest go get the cake?

246
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:01.791
A guest should get a gift too.

247
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:03.333
- Come, Gurpreet.
- No-no, I am pretty much done here.

248
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:04.083
I'll go get it.

249
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:06.583
I haven't done any cycling today,
I'll go get it.

250
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:07.916
I'll order one.

251
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10.000
This way we'll have five cakes.

252
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12.625
Actually, I can bake
a cake in 15 minutes.

253
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14.375
That way we'll all stay at home
we'll have the cake..

254
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16.333
..and it'll be my gift to you.

255
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:18.208
Ohh, so sweet.

256
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:20.041
But please,
no need for such formalities.

257
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22.958
I am going to invade your kitchen.

258
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:25.166
And you're speaking about formality.

259
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:28.291
Well I'll need an assistant.
Gurpreet, would you mind helping me?

260
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:29.375
Sure.

261
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36.125
The blender's here, fantastic.

262
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38.750
Gurpreet,
chop these fruits please.

263
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:39.458
Sure.

264
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41.666
Manpreet, can you pass me that bowl?

265
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:45.750
Thank you.

266
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:49.916
I also need some flour
and some baking powder.

267
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:52.375
- Sure.
- Thank you.

268
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:56.666
By the way..

269
00:29:56,791 --> 00:30:00.333
..I've an old association
with the name Gurpreet.

270
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02.541
Meaning?

271
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:05.208
My best friend when
I was a kid.. was Gurpreet.

272
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:07.000
We would call him Guru.

273
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08.750
He went to India.

274
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:11.041
Later, on my first trip to New York..

275
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:13.833
..the name of my first
taxi driver was Gurpreet.

276
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:16.541
And you won't believe this.

277
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:18.333
When I was returning from New York..

278
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21.708
..my taxi-driver to the airport,
was another Gurpreet.

279
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:22.916
And just see this..

280
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:25.791
There are seven Gurpreets
in my phone diary.

281
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:27.125
Seven.

282
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:28.541
My last girlfriend's dad..

283
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:30.416
Sardar Gurpreet Singh Dhillon.

284
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:32.416
Thank God for him.
If it wasn't for him..

285
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:34.791
..I would've been married by now.

286
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37.041
But it's unbelievable.

287
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:40.250
All seven Gurpreets were men.

288
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:41.583
Oh really!

289
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:47.416
Until 10 minutes ago, I thought
only guys name can be Gurpreet.

290
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:54.333
Here are your fruits and your knife.

291
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:55.458
Make it yourself.

292
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:57.791
- I haven't finished yet.
- What?

293
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:01.500
After meeting you today, I felt..

294
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:04.291
Only girls should be called Gurpreet.

295
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08.583
Whatever.

296
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:14.875
- Thank you.
- Take some more.

297
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16.083
Thank you, sir.

298
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:23.333
- Manpreet, the food is fabulous.
- Thank you.

299
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25.958
You should taste Manpreet's
kidney-beans and rice.

300
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:28.041
- It's out of this world.
- Is it?

301
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:29.791
So Shekhar.

302
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31.333
- Yeah.
- How long do you plan to stay here?

303
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:33.041
Don't know.

304
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:39.166
Honestly, I don't know.

305
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:43.750
And anyway I believe,
we never decide the time.

306
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:45.291
Life does.

307
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:47.375
We just pretend.

308
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:57.208
One day, papa passed away suddenly.

309
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00.666
He wasn't that old or sick.

310
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02.458
One day he was leaving for office..

311
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04.750
I was having my breakfast.

312
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:07.333
He turned around and said bye.
I saw..

313
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10.125
..something unusual.

314
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:12.958
But before I could ask.. he..

315
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:16.708
..just collapsed.

316
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:21.625
We had..

317
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:25.500
..so many plans together.

318
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:31.375
Some for the next vacation,
some for 20 years later.

319
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:35.500
Later, I decided
I won't plan anything.

320
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:38.625
Just take life as it comes.

321
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44.041
I see life..differently.

322
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:51.458
Remember how your cousins would
come home during summer vacations.

323
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:55.833
We would make plans at night.

324
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59.958
We would plan 14 days
of fun in just 7 days.

325
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:03.583
We'll do this..we'll do that.

326
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:12.791
And then one day..vacations
would get over.

327
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16.208
Everyone would go back to their homes.

328
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:17.958
That's how life is..

329
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22.125
Ends suddenly..like summer vacations.

330
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:28.708
We make plans for many
lifetimes in one lifetime.

331
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32.375
And then cry over
things we couldn't do.

332
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37.750
I still do things that papa liked.

333
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:41.458
He's always around me.

334
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:46.458
Sometimes as papa,
sometimes as Gurpreet.

335
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:50.458
Sometimes he's
warm..sometimes furious.

336
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52.625
And sometimes..

337
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:57.125
..he just watches me sleep all night.

338
00:33:58,041 --> 00:33:59.500
I never stop myself.

339
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:05.000
I just embrace happiness
wherever I get it.

340
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07.416
Because who knows..

341
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:10.041
..when the vacations might end.

342
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:12.500
You're absolutely right.

343
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:14.166
Nice thought.

344
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:17.416
'Life is a summer vacation.'

345
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:24.958
Here! Your cake's ready.

346
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:26.083
Let's see this.

347
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29.083
We'll know when we see it.

348
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30.458
Bravo.

349
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:32.875
- Let me help you.
- Yes.

350
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:34.000
- Facing down?
- Yes.

351
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:37.625
We'll soon find out.

352
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:40.583
Happy birthday, Manpreet.

353
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:42.875
- Thank you so much.
- Happy birthday.

354
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:44.208
Make a wish.

355
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:45.750
Okay.

356
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51.541
"Happy birthday to you."

357
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:54.083
"Happy birthday to you."

358
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57.416
"Happy birthday dear Manpreet."

359
00:34:57,625 --> 00:35:00.041
"Happy birthday to you."

360
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05.291
Thank you.

361
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:06.666
Not bad.

362
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:09.541
Taran, I think you've found
the consultant for your patisserie.

363
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15.041
- Seriously, it's really nice.
- Thank you.

364
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:17.791
Taran and I,
we're starting a patisserie.

365
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19.875
You will be our consultant.

366
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:21.458
No-no, very bad choice.

367
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:22.583
Why?

368
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:24.500
I only know
how to make few things.

369
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26.708
But a very dear friend of my,
François.

370
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28.750
He runs the best patisserie in London.

371
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31.583
Come along,
and I'll introduce you to him.

372
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:34.125
And he'll give you the best advice,
and that's for sure.

373
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:46.750
"O beloved.."

374
00:35:49,291 --> 00:36:00.041
"Life has offers both
happiness and cure. "

375
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:11.375
"What do I do..
my heart grieves for you."

376
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:22.208
"As if, every breath of
mine chants your name."

377
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:32.791
"As if, every breath of mine
chants your name."

378
00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:39.875
Taran, it was a pleasure meeting you.

379
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:42.041
Be ready, and I'll see you at 10.

380
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43.458
Sure.

381
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:46.250
Manpreet, can I give you a hug please.

382
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:47.500
Of course.

383
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51.875
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

384
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:54.791
- Keep coming as long as you're here.
- I will.

385
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:11.708
Shekhar.

386
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:13.541
Shekhar.

387
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:16.083
God..

388
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:17.625
Hi. Good morning.

389
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:18.958
I've been calling you for so long.

390
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:21.833
I thought I'll turn
around when the song's over.

391
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:24.250
Very funny.

392
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26.375
It was hard to notice the headphones.

393
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:27.958
You're up early.

394
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31.708
- We didn't sleep all night.
- I see.

395
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33.791
The three of us were
chatting all night.

396
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35.541
And brother Navjot.

397
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:38.083
He doesn't live with us.

398
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39.791
He just comes over sometimes.

399
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:43.958
His father is quiet old.
So he feels lonely.

400
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:48.166
- That's sweet of him.
- Yeah, he's really sweet.

401
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:50.916
Coffee?

402
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:51.708
Okay.

403
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:52.541
Come.

404
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:56.875
She thought she loved me.

405
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58.458
But she didn't?

406
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:01.208
- No, she did.
- Then?

407
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:04.458
- Then she found it.
- Who?

408
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:07.708
- What she always wanted.
- Then who were you?

409
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:09.875
She just loved me.

410
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:11.750
That's esoteric.

411
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:13.416
It's practical.

412
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:14.791
- Sugar?
- No.

413
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:18.958
Between our desires
and our choices in life..

414
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:24.833
..lies our weakness.. ..or our strength.

415
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:31.000
That's even more esoteric.

416
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:34.458
And now?

417
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:37.541
No love or anything
of that sort until 2019.

418
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:38.791
Just free as a bird.

419
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:41.166
Why 2019?

420
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:43.541
Just like that.

421
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05.375
- Hi. Morning.
- Hi.

422
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:12.500
Wow. So you'll open the
door and all for me, huh?

423
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:13.791
That's my dad.

424
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:17.500
He would teach me about chivalry
and respecting women since I was nine.

425
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:20.250
And he even managed to
imbibe some of the habits in me.

426
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:33.958
Shall we get something
for you for the road?

427
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35.916
Some coffee/sandwiches.
It's a long drive.

428
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37.458
No-no, I am good.

429
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:49.250
By the way, what do you do?

430
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:51.875
I mean..what do you want to do?

431
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54.625
Me..I travel.

432
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:57.875
Meet people.. see new places..

433
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:00.041
But, mostly alone.

434
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:04.583
I mean professionally, what do you..

435
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06.500
Professionally.. sorry..

436
00:40:07,916 --> 00:40:12.250
You see Taran, about 6
years ago I had a Chinese friend.

437
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:13.541
Zhi.

438
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18.666
He had a financial mind..and
I was the software kind.

439
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:21.291
So together we designed an app.

440
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:23.833
We had a small office, in a garage.

441
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:27.041
Just the two of us.

442
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:29.875
Soon it grew bigger..

443
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:32.583
We had around 20-25
people working for us.

444
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:38.750
I always thought we can work
harder and expand the company.

445
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:44.625
But one day Zhi..made
a deal on the company.

446
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:47.166
The money offered was huge,
so we thought..

447
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48.875
Doesn't matter how much
money you were offered..

448
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52.625
- ..you worked hard to build that company..
- 62 million Dollars.

449
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56.166
We each got 30-30.

450
00:40:57,375 --> 00:40:59.666
- 62 million Dollars?
- Yeah.

451
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01.666
Then why work?

452
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:03.375
Exactly.

453
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:06.083
But no..I wanted to work.

454
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:10.500
But Zhi said let's
take a break for few years.

455
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:13.750
And we'll start something new in 2019.

456
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:18.166
What is so special about 2019?

457
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:21.958
I guess Gurpreet's told you a lot.

458
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:31.916
Why did you love Amar?

459
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:39.916
- What do you mean?
- I mean..

460
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:46.166
I want to know why someone
loves a person so much.

461
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:50.916
I don't know.

462
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:55.000
You know..like he was a part of me.

463
00:41:56,541 --> 00:42:00.083
A part of my body.. part of my soul.

464
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:02.625
If I can separate him from myself..

465
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:04.375
..then maybe I can
think why I loved him?

466
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:08.958
I guess..love isn't reasonable.

467
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13.541
It's beyond reason.

468
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:15.833
Beautiful.

469
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:23.583
Listen to me, right.

470
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:28.875
Shekhar, oh my God!

471
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:30.250
Come here you..

472
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:33.958
And this beautiful lady, Taron..

473
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:35.125
- Taran.
- Taran.

474
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:36.958
Come here. Come here.

475
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:39.875
So this is my boyfriend, Daniel.

476
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:41.916
- Nice to meet you.
- I know, right.

477
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:45.625
You know, I used to have
a crush on him back in college.

478
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47.583
But he's so grossly heterosexual.

479
00:42:47,916 --> 00:42:49.333
And boring. So..

480
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52.791
You show him the cakes.
Only the cakes.

481
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:55.166
And you and I Taran,
we're going to have a chat. Okay.

482
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:56.375
- Yeah.
- Come on.

483
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59.666
- Okay.
- So, what are we trying today?

484
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:02.083
Francoise says you might
like some of the carrot cake.

485
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:03.625
I was going to cut you a slice,
if that's okay.

486
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05.041
- Please do that.
- Okay.

487
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:06.583
Try..

488
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11.125
Good choice, no?

489
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:16.708
So darling, you want to open up
a pattisserie, don't you?

490
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:19.708
This is a very, very, very hard..

491
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24.166
I never, never helped anyone.

492
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27.625
Because nobody helped me, so I
don't do this. But he vouched for you.

493
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:29.833
So I..

494
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:32.000
I will help you.

495
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:35.375
- And that is..
- So..set!

496
00:43:36,666 --> 00:43:37.750
I will help you..

497
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40.250
..but you've to do it together.

498
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:42.458
And you've to do it
with your heart, okay?

499
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:44.125
- Yes, I will.
- Okay.

500
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:47.250
So, you let me know
if you change your mind.

501
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50.666
I will let you know
if I change my mind.

502
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:51.458
Liar.

503
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:52.291
Bye.

504
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:53.541
Bye, I'll see you.

505
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:55.208
- Bye Daniel, I'll see you.
- Bye.

506
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58.791
I feel like taking to
the skies and tell everyone.

507
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:03.125
You see Taran, the time that
will take us to get to the airport..

508
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:04.833
Amar!

509
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:25.791
I was happy.

510
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:31.125
Maybe I would've told him first,
if he was alive.

511
00:45:32,916 --> 00:45:36.958
The first person you
think of in a happy moment..

512
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:40.458
..is the most valuable
person in their life.

513
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:42.250
You know..

514
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:47.166
Most people turn their back on life.

515
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:52.750
Actually..we're used
to carrying our past.

516
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:56.208
And no matter how many
options life sends our way..

517
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:58.041
..we don't see them.

518
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:02.791
There can never be an option
for someone we love, Shekhar.

519
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:04.083
Of course not.

520
00:46:04,416 --> 00:46:06.125
How can there be an option for humans?

521
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:08.500
Then?

522
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10.750
What do you want from life?

523
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:13.166
Just a little happiness.

524
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15.875
And for some reason,
even you don't know..

525
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:18.375
..that you were
happy with Amar, right.

526
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:20.750
But Amar isn't here anymore.

527
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:22.875
So what now?

528
00:46:23,416 --> 00:46:27.125
Maybe not Amar, but you can
surely search for happiness.

529
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:32.416
You just..need to look ahead.

530
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34.250
Happiness is right in front of you.

531
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37.291
Go get your share of happiness
through your options.

532
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:38.958
What options?

533
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:41.041
I don't know.

534
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:43.541
Only you can see your options.

535
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:46.250
Maybe that lamp-post.

536
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:51.208
What about that lamp-post?

537
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:55.666
Maybe you'll find happiness
by just leaning on it.

538
00:46:57,625 --> 00:47:00.166
Or maybe that..musician's music.

539
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:02.208
Or a cup of coffee
or a glass of champagne.

540
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:03.250
I don't know.

541
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:06.291
Taran..

542
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:11.375
..every minute.. a moment is
passing-by right now too..

543
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:17.375
All you need to do is..make
every passing moment happy.

544
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:20.708
And you decide what makes you happy.

545
00:47:21,416 --> 00:47:23.750
That lamp-post, or that music or..

546
00:47:23,916 --> 00:47:25.541
..coffee,
or the champagne or something else.

547
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:30.416
It's your life, your moments,
your happiness.

548
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:32.500
And so are the choices.

549
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:12.125
"The wise Kabir says,
don't cage your heart, let it soar."

550
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:14.708
"Roll the dice of joy,
enjoy the game.."

551
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:17.041
"..make your move,
O free-spirited one!"

552
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:20.500
"O free-spirited one!"

553
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25.875
"The wise Kabir says,
don't cage your heart, let it soar."

554
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:28.375
"Roll the dice of joy,
enjoy the game.."

555
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30.750
"..make your move,
O free-spirited one!"

556
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:34.000
"O free-spirited one!"

557
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:39.208
"Once or many times,
you win some, you lose some."

558
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:42.083
"Play your best, enjoy the game.."

559
00:48:42,166 --> 00:48:44.416
"..make your move,
O free-spirited one!"

560
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:47.500
"O free-spirited one!"

561
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:53.250
"The wise Kabir says,
don't cage your heart, let it soar."

562
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:55.791
"Roll the dice of joy,
enjoy the game.."

563
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:57.500
"..make your move,
O free-spirited one!"

564
00:48:58,208 --> 00:49:00.000
"O free-spirited one!"

565
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:27.458
"I fly away to an unknown city."

566
00:49:27,541 --> 00:49:30.625
"What provokes this madness in me?"

567
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33.125
"O free-spirited one!"

568
00:49:34,375 --> 00:49:37.458
"Is this day or night?"

569
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:40.791
"Who cares to remember anymore!"

570
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:44.208
"What could be the magic?"

571
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:47.000
"O free-spirited one!"

572
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:51.208
"Once or many times,
you win some, you lose some."

573
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:54.000
"Play your best, enjoy the game.."

574
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:56.583
"..make your move,
O free-spirited one!"

575
00:49:58,125 --> 00:49:59.958
"O free-spirited one!"

576
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:04.958
"The wise Kabir says,
don't cage your heart, let it soar."

577
00:50:05,208 --> 00:50:07.750
"Roll the dice of joy,
enjoy the game.."

578
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:10.958
"..make your move,
O free-spirited one!"

579
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19.500
"O free-spirited one!"

580
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:22.916
You were right!

581
00:50:23,583 --> 00:50:24.833
You were right!

582
00:50:25,583 --> 00:50:29.666
Life should be like
this road, straight-ahead!

583
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:34.958
Life should rush into your lungs,
like this weather.

584
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:39.666
Life should get entangled
in your curls, like this wind!

585
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48.000
Are you okay?

586
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:18.750
Shekhar didn't know and..

587
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:21.250
..she gulped it down
like a professional.

588
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:24.083
She is asleep anyway.

589
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:27.416
You can overact when she wakes up.

590
00:51:50,958 --> 00:51:52.833
Don't worry Manpreet, she is fine.

591
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:57.833
She was quite happy,
and this happened.

592
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:00.958
It's a good thing that she was happy.

593
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:06.375
Thanks.

594
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:07.625
See you.

595
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:27.708
Hey, Gurpreet.

596
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:30.666
I need to meet you, urgently.

597
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:34.083
Okay.. is everything okay?

598
00:52:39,041 --> 00:52:40.458
No-No-No!

599
00:52:41,666 --> 00:52:43.458
This is a very serious matter.

600
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:49.708
After all he is Gurpreet's boyfriend.

601
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51.416
He's invited us to dinner.

602
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53.291
And Manpreet's refusing to go.

603
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:56.208
Now that will be very
embarrassing for her.

604
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:58.458
She hasn't even met him yet.

605
00:52:58,916 --> 00:53:01.333
You mean she rejected
him without even meeting?

606
00:53:01,875 --> 00:53:02.833
Exactly.

607
00:53:03,375 --> 00:53:05.458
Just because he's a Pakistani.

608
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:09.583
- So what if he's a Pakistani.
- Exactly.

609
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:11.416
They should meet once.

610
00:53:11,791 --> 00:53:14.500
I can understand if
she rejects him later.

611
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16.666
But she will never meet him!

612
00:53:16,916 --> 00:53:19.416
You know how.. how stubborn she is!

613
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:23.166
Look, dear. I can talk
to her and she might even go.

614
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:26.625
But I can't guarantee you
what she will do when she gets there.

615
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:28.458
Let's take it one by one.

616
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:29.875
First we must get her to go there.

617
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33.125
Well.. let's call her.

618
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:39.833
Why aren't you answering the phone?

619
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41.416
Taran!

620
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:44.500
Must be papa..calling for you.

621
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:46.083
He always calls on the landline,
for you.

622
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:51.666
Yes, dear. How are you?

623
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:52.875
Hello, papa.

624
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:54.458
I am not fine.

625
00:53:54,708 --> 00:53:56.166
You already know about Taran.

626
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:58.625
And that Gurpreet's
acting like a real 'twisty'.

627
00:53:58,875 --> 00:54:00.875
Yeah dear, she did call.

628
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:03.250
Poor girl was crying a lot.

629
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:05.791
But we can't exactly
tie her to a pole.

630
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:08.166
How is it 'tying her to a pole'?

631
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:10.541
What are you saying?
The boy's a Pakistani.

632
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12.250
You know the situation.

633
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:13.500
What situation, dear?

634
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:16.250
The kind that Pakistanis have.

635
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:19.291
Blasts here.. explosions there!

636
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:24.083
Dear, we'll consider
all that when we talk to them.

637
00:54:24,625 --> 00:54:27.000
But I feel we should meet them once.

638
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30.500
I talked to Shekhar as well.

639
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:32.333
He has the same opinion.

640
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:34.583
Anyone will have the same opinion.

641
00:54:34,791 --> 00:54:36.500
You're too naïve,
you don't know anything.

642
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38.541
There's no point in going
to any Pakistani's home.

643
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:39.458
Out of the question.

644
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:44.458
Talk to him, dear.
And I'll do as you two say.

645
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45.583
- No.
- And..

646
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47.625
Talk to her.

647
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:50.041
She should feel that
someone's on her side.

648
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:53.041
If we try to corner her,
she will never agree.

649
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55.250
Talk to her.

650
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02.708
Yes, Manpreet.

651
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:04.666
What do you say, Shekhar?

652
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:07.750
Well..a Pakistani guy
is out of the question.

653
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:08.541
What?

654
00:55:08,833 --> 00:55:09.791
Isn't it?

655
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:11.083
Yes.

656
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:13.708
And anyway,
there are no boys in Pakistan.

657
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:14.541
What?

658
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:16.666
Why? Are there no boys in Pakistan?

659
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:18.833
Well, half of them
are busy playing cricket..

660
00:55:19,166 --> 00:55:20.833
..and the rest are unpredictable.

661
00:55:22,416 --> 00:55:23.416
But there must be some guys.

662
00:55:23,541 --> 00:55:25.791
Yeah..there must be a couple of them.

663
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30.458
We'll come along to
see the guy if you say so..

664
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:33.291
..but our lives could
be at stake in Pakistan.

665
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:36.750
No Shekhar,
he lives right here..in Edinburgh.

666
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40.833
I see.. so he moved here!

667
00:55:41,625 --> 00:55:43.500
I am telling you very
clever these people are.

668
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:46.083
No he didn't move here,
he was born here.

669
00:55:46,708 --> 00:55:50.708
But Manpreet, we must check whether
he's got a local passport or of Pakistan.

670
00:55:51,041 --> 00:55:52.291
What difference does that make?

671
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55.291
Even we have a local passport.
Unbelievable.

672
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58.291
Well, that's true.

673
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:00.666
Passport doesn't matter.

674
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04.958
He should be a nice
guy..and keep our girl happy.

675
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:08.541
But..what do we do about Pakistan?

676
00:56:11,208 --> 00:56:15.125
I don't know..Gurpreet
likes him a lot.

677
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17.666
But my heart doesn't agree at all.
Honestly.

678
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19.208
Can I give you an advice?

679
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:21.833
Meet him.

680
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:23.500
And what if I like him?

681
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:26.125
Then don't tell Gurpreet
that you like him.

682
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29.666
That's the problem Shekhar,
that's just it.

683
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:32.916
How will I say no if I like him?

684
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:34.375
He even has a local passport.

685
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:38.791
No Manpreet,
I don't trust these Pakistanis.

686
00:56:39,166 --> 00:56:40.750
Who cares about their passport?

687
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:41.708
I see.

688
00:56:41,875 --> 00:56:44.541
Well..we can at least go meet them.

689
00:56:44,875 --> 00:56:46.125
At least we'll get some good food.

690
00:56:46,416 --> 00:56:47.750
Pakistanis make really good food.

691
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:51.208
Yes..I think that sounds logical.

692
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54.291
Let's go meet them,
we'll get to eat some good food too.

693
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57.000
It's been so long I
haven't seen a Pakistani.

694
00:56:57,291 --> 00:56:58.708
They are very handsome.

695
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:01.666
But remember Manpreet..

696
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04.208
..we've to say no.

697
00:57:04,666 --> 00:57:05.875
Of course we do.

698
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:07.791
But there's no harm in seeing one.

699
00:57:19,583 --> 00:57:20.416
Come, dear.

700
00:57:20,791 --> 00:57:22.541
The house looks okay.

701
00:57:23,416 --> 00:57:25.166
- How are you?
- Fine.

702
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:28.375
- Hello.
- Hello. Please..come in.

703
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:29.666
Come, dear.

704
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:31.500
Your house is really beautiful,
Inshallah.

705
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:33.250
That's Mashallah.

706
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34.541
Mashallah?

707
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:36.666
Isn't Inshallah and
Mashallah the same?

708
00:57:36,875 --> 00:57:37.708
Not at all.

709
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:41.083
Inshallah is when you
want to say 'God Willing'.

710
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44.208
Like 'You will like my
house 'Inshallah' (God Willing).

711
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47.583
And Mashallah when you want
to say 'save you from evil eye'.

712
00:57:48,041 --> 00:57:51.125
Like 'You're looking so beautiful
'Mashallah'.

713
00:57:52,583 --> 00:57:55.208
Please come in.
I'll call my mother..

714
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:56.416
Your mother's still alive?

715
00:57:56,625 --> 00:57:59.083
Of course..may God bless
her with a long life.

716
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:01.125
Mashallah! Mashallah!

717
00:58:01,416 --> 00:58:03.291
My house looks lively again.

718
00:58:03,583 --> 00:58:07.083
Otherwise he's always
busy-busy and more busy.

719
00:58:07,208 --> 00:58:10.416
After meeting Gurpreet
I had some hope.

720
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13.625
- Your sister is really amazing.
- That she is.

721
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:16.166
- Come, I'll show you around the house.
- You take a seat, mom.

722
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:17.458
I'll show them around.

723
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:19.416
Do you know the way around the house?

724
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:22.833
- You're mostly at the hospital.
- Hospital? Why?

725
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25.000
I am a doctor, Manpreet.

726
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27.833
- Come, we'll show you around.
- Yes.

727
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:29.625
- This is our drawing room.
- I see.

728
00:58:29,791 --> 00:58:31.166
That's the kitchen.

729
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:32.625
We'll show you upstairs later.

730
00:58:32,791 --> 00:58:35.291
This is the guest room.
And this is..

731
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:37.416
..our temple.

732
00:58:37,666 --> 00:58:39.125
- Temple?
- Yes.

733
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:42.958
But Gurpreet said you're Pakistani.

734
00:58:44,583 --> 00:58:46.500
We are Pakistanis.

735
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:48.166
Do you have any objection?

736
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49.750
Of course not.

737
00:58:50,208 --> 00:58:52.125
We don't if you don't.

738
00:58:52,541 --> 00:58:54.541
But doesn't your
family have a problem.

739
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:56.833
Being a Pakistani,
you pray like Indians.

740
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:00.541
Manpreet dear, we're all Hindus.

741
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:02.833
But you're Pakistani.

742
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:05.750
There are Hindus even in Pakistan.

743
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:08.208
Just like there are Muslims in India.

744
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:10.458
- Please come..
- Thank you.

745
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12.791
Gurpreet,
couldn't you tell me this before?

746
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:16.291
You never let me say
anything beyond Pakistan.

747
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:17.750
I get it, there's a little confusion.

748
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21.041
Why do you wear a sherwani,
and not pant and shirt?

749
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:22.791
I always wear a pant and shirt.

750
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:27.458
But I thought of wearing
this today so I could impress you.

751
00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:28.958
Too much confusion!

752
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:32.458
There's a different between
religion and culture.

753
00:59:32,625 --> 00:59:36.500
We're Hindu by religion..and
our culture is Pakistani.

754
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:38.708
And we're proud of our culture.

755
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40.000
See..

756
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:43.416
Such a simple theory,
made so complicated by the world!

757
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:45.375
Things are always simple..

758
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:48.166
..but when you don't understand,
it gets complicated.

759
00:59:49,208 --> 00:59:50.000
- Yes.
- Leave it.

760
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:51.166
I'll serve dinner.

761
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:53.083
I hope no one's vegetarian.

762
00:59:56,916 --> 00:59:57.708
Wait a minute.

763
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00.541
There's another surprise
in store after dinner.

764
01:00:01,791 --> 01:00:03.958
- Harry sings really well.
- I see.

765
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:05.250
And so does mom.

766
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07.750
So how about you sing
a song today for me.

767
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:27.666
"The moon's very proud..

768
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31.916
"..about its moonlight."

769
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:40.333
"He hasn't met you yet,
hence the arrogance."

770
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:44.375
"Is there a secret in your heart.."

771
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:48.333
"..or are you high on love?"

772
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:56.708
"There's definitely
a reason for such praises."

773
01:00:57,083 --> 01:01:03.375
"The crazy heart.."

774
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:11.500
"The crazy heart.."

775
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:26.625
"My beloved's come home today."

776
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:34.250
"My heart's really elated."

777
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:43.625
"As I caught a glimpse of
my handsome beloved."

778
01:01:44,041 --> 01:01:50.375
"My eyes feel bewitched."

779
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:58.791
"My eyes feel bewitched."

780
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:17.708
I am sorry we didn't
get a chance to talk.

781
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23.500
I just wanted to say I am
so sorry I got so drunk that day.

782
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:29.375
You were happy, weren't you?

783
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:34.833
A lot.

784
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:40.333
Nice people.

785
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42.625
Yes. Very nice.

786
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46.708
They will keep Gurpreet happy.

787
01:02:55,916 --> 01:02:57.541
- Can I say something?
- No.

788
01:02:58,083 --> 01:02:58.916
Shut up.

789
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:02.833
You know, Shekhar's plans
for 2019 will soon get cancelled.

790
01:03:03,666 --> 01:03:05.666
He's always looking
at Taran so secretly.

791
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:08.958
- He thinks we don't know.
- That's true.

792
01:03:09,083 --> 01:03:10.250
But she's no less either.

793
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:12.208
She was whispering
to him on the terrace.

794
01:03:12,291 --> 01:03:14.333
I wasn't whispering, only apologizing.

795
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16.458
Oh my..apology.

796
01:03:16,541 --> 01:03:18.375
You never apologized to us.

797
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:36.541
Go back to sleep,
it's not morning yet.

798
01:03:38,166 --> 01:03:39.625
Someone's calling.

799
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:45.333
What are you doing?

800
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:48.875
Hello.

801
01:04:29,916 --> 01:04:30.625
Hi.

802
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:32.708
Hi.

803
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:36.125
- Let me guess..Francois called.
- Yes.

804
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:38.458
The bank's sent a mail,
he's leaving from London.

805
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40.000
He wanted to start work today itself.

806
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:42.250
- Alright, sounds good.
- I thought we could have coffee together.

807
01:04:42,458 --> 01:04:44.166
I wanted to tell you first.

808
01:04:49,416 --> 01:04:50.416
Nice house.

809
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:53.500
It's a mess, I like it like that.

810
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:04.458
Thanks.

811
01:05:05,416 --> 01:05:06.250
For what?

812
01:05:07,791 --> 01:05:08.750
A lot.

813
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:10.625
Not at all.

814
01:05:11,583 --> 01:05:13.375
Francois is a dear friend.

815
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16.250
We wouldn't have to go at all.

816
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:19.083
I could've called him
instead and he would've come.

817
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:23.083
But I thought you'll
get out of the house..

818
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25.083
..see few things, think over things.

819
01:05:25,708 --> 01:05:26.708
Yes, thanks for that.

820
01:05:26,875 --> 01:05:27.958
Not for Francois.

821
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:29.833
I mean for that too..

822
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:35.416
But mostly..for all the
concern you've shown for me.

823
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:36.708
You've done so much.

824
01:05:37,375 --> 01:05:40.166
You told me so many
things..about happiness.

825
01:05:40,375 --> 01:05:41.625
About finding happiness.

826
01:05:42,916 --> 01:05:43.875
Thanks.

827
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:52.791
See you.. I must go get ready.

828
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:08.416
I would really like it..if
you stay around me for this project.

829
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:09.666
Be with me.

830
01:06:15,791 --> 01:06:17.416
See you, bye.

831
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:24.625
Taran!

832
01:06:25,541 --> 01:06:26.458
Wait a minute.

833
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:36.791
When Zhi and I started our company..

834
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:40.791
..I used to wear this watch.

835
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:48.666
This watch changed my time.

836
01:06:49,416 --> 01:06:50.458
I want you to have it.

837
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:53.541
Why are you doing all this for me?

838
01:06:54,666 --> 01:06:55.875
I don't know.

839
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:00.208
I don't..

840
01:07:16,291 --> 01:07:20.625
"Blessed love..!"

841
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25.583
"Blessed love..!"

842
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:31.708
"Blessed love..!"

843
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:42.291
"I'm drenched by your shower of love."

844
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:51.791
"Your breath makes me soar high."

845
01:07:52,541 --> 01:08:02.541
"The world shifted beneath my feet."

846
01:08:02,708 --> 01:08:11.500
"This never happened before."

847
01:08:12,916 --> 01:08:22.458
"Congratulations,
dear heart, this is love!"

848
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:32.666
"Congratulations,
dear heart, this is love!"

849
01:08:55,416 --> 01:09:00.416
"Blessed love..!"

850
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:05.458
"Blessed love..!"

851
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:10.541
"Blessed love..!"

852
01:09:10,625 --> 01:09:16.000
"Blessed love..!"

853
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:21.041
"Why does it feel like.."

854
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:27.416
"..your gaze lingers in my eyes!"

855
01:09:27,916 --> 01:09:37.416
"Expressing things
that I never knew of."

856
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:42.125
"You are everywhere I see.."

857
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:47.541
"..then how can I go away from you?"

858
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:56.458
"Congratulations,
dear heart, this is love!"

859
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:06.875
"Congratulations,
dear heart, this is love!"

860
01:10:31,708 --> 01:10:41.458
"I still stand where I met you first."

861
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:51.291
"Your heart is the city,
from which I never returned."

862
01:10:51,416 --> 01:11:01.083
"I'm lost somewhere, do let
me know if you happen to find me."

863
01:11:01,333 --> 01:11:10.375
"Congratulations,
dear heart, this is love!"

864
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:20.500
"Congratulations,
dear heart, this is love!"

865
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:28.125
"Blessed love..!"

866
01:11:28,375 --> 01:11:33.458
"Blessed love..!"

867
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:38.333
"Blessed love..!"

868
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:42.500
"Blessed love..!"

869
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:48.666
"Blessed love..!"

870
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:00.541
What happened?

871
01:12:03,708 --> 01:12:04.791
Nothing.

872
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:06.958
Taran, something's wrong.

873
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:12.250
It's not like I don't miss him.

874
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:18.375
You know, some nights..

875
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21.125
..I feel like I am plunging
thousands of feet below.

876
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24.458
And I wake up suddenly.

877
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42.500
What's wrong, Shekhar?

878
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:47.083
Shekhar?

879
01:12:52,208 --> 01:12:53.375
What's wrong, Shekhar?

880
01:13:05,291 --> 01:13:08.000
Whenever you're scared
of anything in life..

881
01:13:08,791 --> 01:13:10.458
..then you must face it.

882
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:13.458
Fear is a coward.

883
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:18.666
If you stare directly in its eye,
it runs away.

884
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:45.541
You know, people have woken
up from coma even after 10 years.

885
01:15:47,166 --> 01:15:51.041
Sometimes they lose their
memory..or something else.

886
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:53.750
Amar will be fine, so papa was saying.

887
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:57.333
And that French doctor
doesn't speak English.

888
01:15:58,875 --> 01:16:00.083
But she was saying that he's fine.

889
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:02.958
But didn't papa talk to Amar as well?

890
01:16:03,083 --> 01:16:05.208
- Yes, they spoke briefly.
- Yes.

891
01:16:06,541 --> 01:16:07.916
Did papa leave from home?

892
01:16:08,458 --> 01:16:10.166
He sounded okay on the phone.

893
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:12.875
He was saying he often
forgets few things.

894
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:15.958
But it all comes
back if you remind him.

895
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:19.583
I hope he's fine.

896
01:16:20,958 --> 01:16:22.583
He will be absolutely fine, papa.

897
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:25.625
You know, sometimes
when you wake up from a nap..

898
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:27.208
..you often forget things.

899
01:16:28,291 --> 01:16:30.416
And poor guy was in coma for 8 months.

900
01:16:31,541 --> 01:16:33.208
But don't worry.
He'll be fine.

901
01:16:34,833 --> 01:16:36.541
God bless that doctor.

902
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:40.791
She was saying.. someone
found him in a small river.

903
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:43.791
They kept treating him for 8 months.

904
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:54.000
How are you, papa?

905
01:18:11,625 --> 01:18:12.625
Where is Taran?

906
01:18:30,583 --> 01:18:31.625
Amar.

907
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:52.250
This is the fourth time
we crossed this statue.

908
01:19:54,083 --> 01:19:56.125
Being a drifter has its own perks.

909
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59.083
Being a drifter has
its own benefits too.

910
01:20:00,541 --> 01:20:02.583
If you pass-by the same road..

911
01:20:03,791 --> 01:20:06.125
..you often notice new things.

912
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:13.916
- Doctor, do you drink?
- Of course.

913
01:20:14,166 --> 01:20:16.333
The martyrdom of the grapes
should never be in vain.

914
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17.583
This is important.

915
01:20:17,958 --> 01:20:20.833
"Mix some love with alcohol."

916
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:25.958
- No-no-no..
- Why?

917
01:20:26,958 --> 01:20:28.958
- Go on, and take him too.
- Dance..

918
01:20:29,208 --> 01:20:30.625
Papa..take papa along.

919
01:20:30,958 --> 01:20:33.583
- Go-go-go.
- What will I do?

920
01:20:54,791 --> 01:20:56.250
There-there-there.

921
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:26.583
Guys.. I am absolutely fine.

922
01:21:26,958 --> 01:21:28.083
- And papa..
- Yes.

923
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:29.708
Don't worry at all.

924
01:21:29,958 --> 01:21:32.041
From tomorrow I will resume office,
I promise.

925
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:33.958
No need to go to the office.

926
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:35.916
Do you know the state we were in?

927
01:21:37,916 --> 01:21:39.750
Please sit next to me for a while.

928
01:21:40,791 --> 01:21:42.375
I'll obey all your orders.

929
01:21:42,666 --> 01:21:44.125
Do exactly as you say.

930
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:47.916
And I promise, I will get well soon.
Absolutely fit, like before.

931
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:56.291
Cheers to Amar's return!

932
01:21:56,666 --> 01:21:58.666
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

933
01:21:58,875 --> 01:21:59.791
Cheers!

934
01:22:23,708 --> 01:22:24.500
Come.

935
01:22:28,958 --> 01:22:30.625
You're really late today.

936
01:22:32,166 --> 01:22:33.916
It's time you hit the bed.

937
01:22:35,208 --> 01:22:38.000
Manpreet and everybody
are waiting downstairs.

938
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:43.416
Amar.

939
01:22:44,541 --> 01:22:45.375
Amar.

940
01:22:53,208 --> 01:22:54.333
You need to sleep.

941
01:22:57,375 --> 01:22:58.958
But you look so beautiful.

942
01:23:44,916 --> 01:23:46.958
Get changed, get into bed and call me.

943
01:23:47,375 --> 01:23:49.291
Manpreet and everyone are waiting.

944
01:23:55,583 --> 01:23:56.583
What?

945
01:23:59,833 --> 01:24:01.000
Fine.

946
01:24:20,458 --> 01:24:21.208
Hi.

947
01:24:23,208 --> 01:24:24.416
You didn't show up?

948
01:24:24,958 --> 01:24:27.541
You know what,
just as you guys left..

949
01:24:27,833 --> 01:24:29.250
..I ran into an old friend.

950
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:33.833
He said let's have some
coffee and ordered beer.

951
01:24:34,333 --> 01:24:35.541
Then we just went on.

952
01:24:37,833 --> 01:24:39.083
I am so happy for you.

953
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:42.375
For everyone actually.

954
01:24:44,291 --> 01:24:45.791
Are you driving?

955
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:48.291
Yes. Why?

956
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:52.083
Nothing.. just go home.

957
01:24:52,958 --> 01:24:54.000
Of course.

958
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:57.916
You take care. I'll see you soon.

959
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:01.333
- Bye.
- Bye.

960
01:25:33,291 --> 01:25:36.208
- Go on..go on.
- Okay?

961
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38.916
- Yeah..alright.
- Yes-yes-yes..

962
01:25:38,958 --> 01:25:42.125
- Good morning, Shekhar!
- Hi, good morning.

963
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:43.625
Good morning.

964
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:47.250
It's okay, I've got it..

965
01:25:47,791 --> 01:25:49.000
You guys are so early today.

966
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:51.750
- Could've shown up a little later.
- Yeah.

967
01:25:51,958 --> 01:25:54.041
Actually, we went out for breakfast.
Pete's.

968
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:57.791
We go there every
Saturday for breakfast.

969
01:25:57,958 --> 01:25:59.500
It's about an hour
and a half from here.

970
01:25:59,666 --> 01:26:01.750
They sell the best pancakes
in the world.

971
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:02.375
Sure.

972
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:06.125
Amar really wanted to go
there..so we left as early as 7am.

973
01:26:08,458 --> 01:26:10.916
- Daniel, Françoise..pancakes.
- Coming.

974
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:12.041
Come fast.

975
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:16.250
- You know Jasleen..
- Who?

976
01:26:17,291 --> 01:26:19.000
The girl beating the drums
at the airport.

977
01:26:19,458 --> 01:26:20.166
Oh yes, right.

978
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:21.416
She is throwing a party today.

979
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:24.208
She has invited you as
well as Francoise and Daniel.

980
01:26:24,458 --> 01:26:27.083
Listen guys, you guys have to come.
All of you.

981
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:28.541
Okay.

982
01:26:29,958 --> 01:26:31.833
Sounds nice, but I hardly know her.

983
01:26:31,958 --> 01:26:35.458
- You know..doesn't make sense.
- What? No, please.

984
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:37.333
Come on, it will be so much fun.

985
01:26:37,833 --> 01:26:40.291
- Please-please-please.
- Okay.

986
01:26:40,791 --> 01:26:41.583
Thanks.

987
01:26:41,666 --> 01:26:43.291
Well, we've to get ready,
so we're leaving.

988
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45.625
Guys, see you at 12..sharp.

989
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:47.291
- Bye-bye.
- Bye..

990
01:26:55,916 --> 01:26:57.500
You won't come, will you?

991
01:27:02,541 --> 01:27:03.250
No.

992
01:27:23,708 --> 01:27:26.125
I knew you wouldn't come.

993
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:29.166
That's why I didn't
go with the others.

994
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:31.500
Why are you complicating life, papa?

995
01:27:32,333 --> 01:27:34.625
Complication is life's problem, son.

996
01:27:35,791 --> 01:27:37.958
Life will decide its course.

997
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:44.041
But we must give life one
fair chance atleast.. isn't it?

998
01:27:49,291 --> 01:27:50.083
Hello?

999
01:27:50,166 --> 01:27:51.291
Hello!

1000
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:52.750
Yes?

1001
01:27:52,833 --> 01:27:54.125
Hello, yes?

1002
01:27:54,375 --> 01:27:55.291
Greetings!

1003
01:28:03,958 --> 01:28:05.791
"Greetings! How are you?"

1004
01:28:05,916 --> 01:28:08.666
"I'm dumbstruck by your looks."

1005
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:12.791
"I've done the unspeakable."

1006
01:28:14,125 --> 01:28:18.333
"You're dumbstruck by my looks,
you've done the unspeakable."

1007
01:28:18,541 --> 01:28:20.625
"Seeing you groove.."

1008
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:25.000
"Seeing you groove,
I want to get on the floor."

1009
01:28:25,291 --> 01:28:26.541
Yes?

1010
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:30.750
"I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!"

1011
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:34.958
"I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!"

1012
01:28:35,041 --> 01:28:39.041
"I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!"

1013
01:28:39,166 --> 01:28:43.208
"I wanna dance with you..
alas, you can't dance!"

1014
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:47.458
"I wanna dance with you..
alas, you can't dance!"

1015
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:51.791
"I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!"

1016
01:29:00,458 --> 01:29:04.250
"He looks into my eyes when flirting.
Doesn't let any chance pass."

1017
01:29:04,333 --> 01:29:09.666
"My heart skips a beat
when it hears your golden voice."

1018
01:29:12,916 --> 01:29:16.708
"Touches me here and there..
enjoy the feel of it!"

1019
01:29:16,791 --> 01:29:21.000
"When I tell him to stop stalking me,
he doesn't relent."

1020
01:29:21,125 --> 01:29:25.083
"I have come only for you,
only for you have I come!"

1021
01:29:25,166 --> 01:29:27.708
"I'll walk into these clubs for you."

1022
01:29:27,791 --> 01:29:29.208
"Yes.. yes.. yes!"

1023
01:29:29,416 --> 01:29:33.416
"I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!"

1024
01:29:33,541 --> 01:29:37.583
"I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!"

1025
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:41.750
"I wanna dance with you..
alas, you can't dance!"

1026
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:45.916
"I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!"

1027
01:29:50,208 --> 01:29:51.916
"I wanna dance with you.."

1028
01:29:54,541 --> 01:29:56.416
"Greetings! How are you?"

1029
01:29:56,541 --> 01:29:58.500
"I'm dumbstruck by your looks."

1030
01:29:58,541 --> 01:30:00.625
"I've done the unspeakable."

1031
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:04.750
"You're dumbstruck by my looks,
you've done the unspeakable."

1032
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:07.041
"Seeing you groove.."

1033
01:30:07,166 --> 01:30:11.541
"Seeing you groove,
I want to get on the floor."

1034
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:12.875
Yes?

1035
01:30:13,125 --> 01:30:17.250
"I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!"

1036
01:30:17,375 --> 01:30:21.416
"I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!"

1037
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:25.541
"I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!"

1038
01:30:25,583 --> 01:30:29.625
"I wanna dance with you..
alas, you can't dance!"

1039
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:33.875
"I wanna dance with you..
alas, you can't dance!"

1040
01:30:34,041 --> 01:30:38.291
"I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!"

1041
01:30:51,375 --> 01:30:55.083
"I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!"

1042
01:31:46,125 --> 01:31:49.375
Gurpreet was saying
you're going somewhere.

1043
01:31:52,041 --> 01:31:52.833
Yes.

1044
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:57.666
I was thinking..
to my father's hometown, India.

1045
01:32:15,708 --> 01:32:17.500
This watch doesn't suit me anymore.

1046
01:32:21,916 --> 01:32:24.166
It's showing me some
very strange times.

1047
01:32:56,708 --> 01:32:58.291
What did Shekhar say?

1048
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:02.333
Nothing, that he's happy for me.

1049
01:33:03,708 --> 01:33:04.958
Is he leaving?

1050
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:11.083
Yes..he was saying,
that after the opening..

1051
01:33:18,041 --> 01:33:19.583
Don't think anything..

1052
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:21.791
..just leave it for a while.

1053
01:33:59,375 --> 01:34:00.625
- Hi..
- What are you wearing?

1054
01:34:01,541 --> 01:34:04.291
- How is this?
- Black is such a night colour.

1055
01:34:04,458 --> 01:34:05.250
This one.

1056
01:34:08,666 --> 01:34:10.708
Hey, this one we got
from Switzerland. Remember?

1057
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:14.333
This one fits nicely..and..green..

1058
01:34:14,541 --> 01:34:17.583
This white shirt will go with green,
and it also suits you really well.

1059
01:34:17,791 --> 01:34:20.000
- I think brown-green-and white.
- Perfect.

1060
01:34:25,125 --> 01:34:27.416
What would I have done without you?

1061
01:34:28,666 --> 01:34:30.208
Thank God I have you in my life.

1062
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:41.708
What's wrong?

1063
01:34:42,833 --> 01:34:44.000
Tired?

1064
01:34:44,875 --> 01:34:45.833
No, it's nothing.

1065
01:34:46,875 --> 01:34:49.416
You get ready quickly, I've to run.

1066
01:35:34,708 --> 01:35:38.375
Two people..without whom
I didn't know where to begin.

1067
01:35:38,625 --> 01:35:39.666
Francois and Daniel.

1068
01:35:39,875 --> 01:35:41.083
Can I have you guys here please?

1069
01:35:47,833 --> 01:35:48.833
And one..

1070
01:35:51,750 --> 01:35:52.500
..friend..

1071
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:55.666
Without whom this would've
never been possible.

1072
01:35:56,208 --> 01:35:57.125
Shekhar.

1073
01:35:57,958 --> 01:35:59.333
Can I have you here please?

1074
01:36:07,916 --> 01:36:09.833
I don't want to thank him.

1075
01:36:10,083 --> 01:36:12.541
I just want him to stand next to me.

1076
01:36:19,833 --> 01:36:23.833
The more you share,
the happier you feel.

1077
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:26.541
So I just want to
say thank you guys..

1078
01:36:26,791 --> 01:36:29.750
..for coming here,
to be a part of my happiness.

1079
01:36:29,916 --> 01:36:32.000
Thank you. Thank you.

1080
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:33.083
Thank you.

1081
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:41.916
Thank you.

1082
01:36:44,041 --> 01:36:54.708
"Whom should I anger.. who
should I be upset with?"

1083
01:36:54,916 --> 01:37:00.125
"Both are my reflections.."

1084
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:05.791
"..who should I break away from?"

1085
01:37:06,166 --> 01:37:17.083
"As if, your eyes ask me something."

1086
01:37:32,833 --> 01:37:34.833
Shekhar, I want you to meet Amar.

1087
01:37:35,125 --> 01:37:37.666
- Hi, Amar.
- Hi, Shekhar.

1088
01:37:37,916 --> 01:37:39.791
Thank you so much for everything.

1089
01:37:40,583 --> 01:37:42.083
Taran can't stop talking about you.

1090
01:37:43,750 --> 01:37:44.916
It's great to meet you.

1091
01:37:46,041 --> 01:37:47.208
I am so happy for you.

1092
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:52.625
Okay, I need to take Amar home,
with papa.

1093
01:37:52,791 --> 01:37:54.750
Because he needs
to turn into bed early.

1094
01:37:57,375 --> 01:37:58.708
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

1095
01:37:59,208 --> 01:38:01.750
And I'll call you, there's
something we need to talk about.

1096
01:38:01,833 --> 01:38:02.500
Sure.

1097
01:38:02,833 --> 01:38:03.791
Bye.

1098
01:38:04,791 --> 01:38:05.583
See you.

1099
01:38:20,416 --> 01:38:21.208
You okay?

1100
01:38:25,583 --> 01:38:26.208
Yeah!

1101
01:38:31,458 --> 01:38:32.458
Are you sure?

1102
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:35.458
Yeah, I am sure.

1103
01:38:59,791 --> 01:39:00.916
Goodnight, Amar.

1104
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05.833
Be ready on time tomorrow.

1105
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:07.791
We've to visit the temple.

1106
01:39:11,041 --> 01:39:12.166
I'll come, pick you up.

1107
01:39:21,875 --> 01:39:22.875
Taran..

1108
01:39:28,708 --> 01:39:29.791
Congratulations.

1109
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:34.750
Goodnight.

1110
01:39:53,166 --> 01:39:54.000
Come here.

1111
01:40:03,375 --> 01:40:05.416
Always concerned
about others happiness.

1112
01:40:06,833 --> 01:40:07.916
Are you happy?

1113
01:40:11,833 --> 01:40:12.791
No, papa.

1114
01:40:15,083 --> 01:40:16.458
I am very sad.

1115
01:40:18,375 --> 01:40:19.250
A lot.

1116
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:25.125
- A lot, papa.
- No, dear.

1117
01:40:26,041 --> 01:40:27.166
Be happy.

1118
01:40:28,208 --> 01:40:30.208
You must find your happiness first.

1119
01:40:30,708 --> 01:40:32.791
Otherwise how will
you spread happiness?

1120
01:40:35,375 --> 01:40:39.750
Even if it means making someone sad.

1121
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:42.750
Do what is right.

1122
01:40:44,833 --> 01:40:46.500
Do what you feel is right!

1123
01:40:48,416 --> 01:40:50.833
There's nothing more you can do.

1124
01:40:52,458 --> 01:40:53.375
Right?

1125
01:41:13,041 --> 01:41:16.291
You said 'meet me for breakfast at 9'.

1126
01:41:18,541 --> 01:41:20.208
I was there at 9.

1127
01:41:22,583 --> 01:41:23.791
But you didn't show up.

1128
01:41:25,583 --> 01:41:30.583
I looked around, asked
people if anyone had seen you.

1129
01:41:32,166 --> 01:41:34.000
But no one had seen you.

1130
01:41:35,041 --> 01:41:38.291
By the time it was
12, I was getting scared.

1131
01:41:39,458 --> 01:41:41.541
I asked papa to come down.

1132
01:41:44,916 --> 01:41:46.500
You didn't show up all night.

1133
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49.416
Nor the next day.

1134
01:41:50,458 --> 01:41:53.541
The people who were
helping us look for you..

1135
01:41:55,875 --> 01:42:00.833
It was clearly evident from
their faces, that we've lost you.

1136
01:42:06,166 --> 01:42:07.166
Amar..

1137
01:42:07,916 --> 01:42:12.583
..I never even dreamt
about a life without you.

1138
01:42:14,041 --> 01:42:17.500
I didn't know what to do.

1139
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:22.833
Then I mustered a lot
of courage and stood up again.

1140
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:26.791
Thinking that I had
to continue without you.

1141
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31.583
But then suddenly, I
bumped into this fool.

1142
01:42:33,375 --> 01:42:34.541
Shekhar.

1143
01:42:40,083 --> 01:42:42.416
As soon as I took my eyes off you..

1144
01:42:44,125 --> 01:42:47.416
..life swept me off my feet.

1145
01:43:01,375 --> 01:43:06.833
Today, I want to confess to you
in His presence, Amar.

1146
01:43:07,708 --> 01:43:10.250
No matter how much I love you..

1147
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:19.166
But now there's someone
else in my life.

1148
01:43:34,916 --> 01:43:36.916
I am always late, right?

1149
01:43:49,583 --> 01:43:50.458
Shekhar.

1150
01:43:51,083 --> 01:43:52.083
- Hi!
- Hi!

1151
01:43:54,833 --> 01:43:57.291
Buddy, I can never lie.

1152
01:43:57,958 --> 01:43:59.166
She knows.

1153
01:44:01,791 --> 01:44:06.416
It's not my fault..nor is it yours.

1154
01:44:07,208 --> 01:44:10.875
The only difference
is that I was her past..

1155
01:44:11,833 --> 01:44:13.375
..and you're her present.

1156
01:44:16,166 --> 01:44:21.083
You know, when I woke
up, I didn't know who I was.

1157
01:44:22,083 --> 01:44:24.166
I couldn't use my hands or limbs.

1158
01:44:25,208 --> 01:44:27.291
For two days they
taught me how to walk.

1159
01:44:27,583 --> 01:44:30.583
Later I remembered papa..then Taran.

1160
01:44:30,958 --> 01:44:32.833
I vaguely remembered my accident.

1161
01:44:34,708 --> 01:44:36.000
Then God.

1162
01:44:36,791 --> 01:44:38.125
Anything could've happened.

1163
01:44:39,833 --> 01:44:40.916
But no..

1164
01:44:41,958 --> 01:44:43.208
I came back.

1165
01:44:44,125 --> 01:44:45.875
Papa's absolutely fine, he's happy.

1166
01:44:46,333 --> 01:44:48.666
Gurpreet, Taran..they are all fine.

1167
01:44:48,791 --> 01:44:50.000
They are all very happy.

1168
01:44:50,416 --> 01:44:54.416
But if there's anything
I've lost in this entire incident..

1169
01:44:57,833 --> 01:44:59.708
..then that's my right on Taran.

1170
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:03.416
What..

1171
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:06.375
..more can I give you?

1172
01:45:15,125 --> 01:45:16.958
Take good care of her, Shekhar.

1173
01:45:20,083 --> 01:45:21.750
At least she will still be my friend.

1174
01:45:23,875 --> 01:45:25.833
Maybe you can call
me someday to scold me.

1175
01:45:29,583 --> 01:45:30.583
See you.

1176
01:45:52,625 --> 01:45:54.166
Taran, he's your friend.

1177
01:45:55,458 --> 01:45:56.708
You love him.

1178
01:45:58,708 --> 01:46:00.541
You've seen many dreams with him.

1179
01:46:00,958 --> 01:46:02.500
Waited for him.

1180
01:46:07,458 --> 01:46:08.541
Who am I?

1181
01:46:09,625 --> 01:46:12.083
Where did I come from?
How long have you known me?

1182
01:46:14,791 --> 01:46:16.333
Let me go to hell.

1183
01:46:18,166 --> 01:46:19.833
I will fly away again.

1184
01:46:20,208 --> 01:46:21.833
Why are you doing this, Taran?

1185
01:46:23,083 --> 01:46:23.750
Why?

1186
01:46:23,833 --> 01:46:26.875
Don't you always say,
'do the right thing'.

1187
01:46:28,666 --> 01:46:29.875
It wasn't your fault.

1188
01:46:30,666 --> 01:46:32.833
You just came in our
lives without a reason.

1189
01:46:33,666 --> 01:46:35.541
You didn't do anything wrong, Shekhar.

1190
01:46:36,208 --> 01:46:40.041
You supported papa. You
did so much for me.

1191
01:46:41,083 --> 01:46:42.333
What do I do?

1192
01:46:43,041 --> 01:46:46.125
Tell you to leave,
because Amar's back.

1193
01:46:46,250 --> 01:46:47.583
Your job's done.

1194
01:46:48,166 --> 01:46:49.666
It's his fault.

1195
01:46:50,583 --> 01:46:52.083
It's completely his fault.

1196
01:46:52,416 --> 01:46:53.583
Where was he?

1197
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:56.000
Where was he for 8 months?

1198
01:46:56,208 --> 01:46:57.208
Where was he?

1199
01:47:27,958 --> 01:47:34.916
"The night was spent such that.."

1200
01:47:35,083 --> 01:47:38.625
"..I couldn't find dawn."

1201
01:47:39,333 --> 01:47:50.208
"As if, the soul
left the body quietly."

1202
01:47:50,416 --> 01:48:01.375
"As if, life moved on fast..
very fast."

1203
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:11.958
"As if, life moved on fast..
very fast."

1204
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:02.125
"How do I walk away.."

1205
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:08.708
"..if he lives somewhere in me?"

1206
01:49:09,916 --> 01:49:16.250
"I try to walk past
without her noticing.."

1207
01:49:16,541 --> 01:49:20.583
"It feels as if.."

1208
01:49:20,708 --> 01:49:30.458
"..her gaze quietly follows me."

1209
01:50:47,958 --> 01:50:49.166
- Hi, Shekhar.
- Hi, Amar.

1210
01:50:49,291 --> 01:50:50.083
Please..

1211
01:50:53,708 --> 01:50:57.375
Shekhar, I am really sorry
that I came here to talk about this.

1212
01:50:58,083 --> 01:51:01.125
It was Taran's decision
that she wants to live with you.

1213
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:05.416
And she's my friend,
and I would always want her to be one.

1214
01:51:06,791 --> 01:51:07.791
Of course.

1215
01:51:08,708 --> 01:51:15.041
Shekhar, Navjot,
Manpreet, Gurpreet, papa..Taran..

1216
01:51:15,750 --> 01:51:17.333
..they all love you.

1217
01:51:18,875 --> 01:51:20.500
And there must be
a reason why they do.

1218
01:51:21,458 --> 01:51:25.625
I am relatively new, and I am sure
I'll start loving you just as much.

1219
01:51:29,208 --> 01:51:31.666
But give me some time.

1220
01:51:35,666 --> 01:51:37.791
But Shekhar, believe me..

1221
01:51:38,125 --> 01:51:42.875
..I'll never do anything
to hurt you or Taran in anyway.

1222
01:51:43,083 --> 01:51:44.000
Never.

1223
01:51:46,958 --> 01:51:48.291
Yeah, I know that Amar.

1224
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:58.916
I only came here because,
that day Taran told me what she wants.

1225
01:51:59,458 --> 01:52:01.458
I thought I should
tell you what I think.

1226
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10.125
'It wasn't your fault.'

1227
01:52:11,208 --> 01:52:12.625
'Don't you always say..

1228
01:52:13,916 --> 01:52:15.250
'Do the right thing'.

1229
01:52:16,375 --> 01:52:17.375
'Amar.'

1230
01:52:18,125 --> 01:52:19.291
'It wasn't your fault.'

1231
01:52:22,125 --> 01:52:23.250
'It wasn't your fault.'

1232
01:53:21,333 --> 01:53:25.750
- Taran, please..careful.
- Shekhar.. Shekhar..

1233
01:53:26,416 --> 01:53:27.291
I am okay.

1234
01:53:28,375 --> 01:53:30.000
- Shekhar..
- I am okay.

1235
01:53:31,166 --> 01:53:33.833
Doctor.. I love you.

1236
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:36.500
I am okay.

1237
01:53:37,833 --> 01:53:40.208
So..goodnight.

1238
01:53:41,916 --> 01:53:42.958
Goodnight.

1239
01:53:43,666 --> 01:53:45.666
- I'll see you.
- Shekhar!

1240
01:53:47,666 --> 01:53:49.208
Nighty-night.

1241
01:53:58,750 --> 01:54:01.083
You don't know how
much I love you, Taran.

1242
01:54:57,666 --> 01:54:59.083
Hey, good morning.

1243
01:54:59,333 --> 01:55:00.875
Good afternoon, really.

1244
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:04.125
- I just woke up.
- I know.

1245
01:55:04,208 --> 01:55:06.458
I knew you will call
as soon as you wake up.

1246
01:55:07,416 --> 01:55:08.625
You slept well?

1247
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10.166
Where are you? At home?

1248
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:11.708
Guess where?

1249
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14.125
Patisserie?

1250
01:55:15,125 --> 01:55:17.458
No, I am driving back from London.

1251
01:55:17,958 --> 01:55:19.416
London? Why?

1252
01:55:20,166 --> 01:55:21.916
You dropped me home at 5.

1253
01:55:22,125 --> 01:55:23.708
You know we all forgot.

1254
01:55:23,958 --> 01:55:26.291
Amar had an appointment today,
with the doctor.

1255
01:55:26,916 --> 01:55:28.791
I remembered just
after I dropped you home.

1256
01:55:28,916 --> 01:55:30.333
I went straight to Amar's house.

1257
01:55:30,416 --> 01:55:32.625
Papa was supposed to drive him there.

1258
01:55:32,958 --> 01:55:34.791
Thank God I made it in time.

1259
01:55:38,208 --> 01:55:39.291
Hello.

1260
01:55:40,125 --> 01:55:40.833
Hello.

1261
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43.000
Sorry..bad network probably.

1262
01:55:43,458 --> 01:55:44.916
Yeah, the mountains.

1263
01:55:45,041 --> 01:55:46.708
You know, there's amazing news.

1264
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:50.541
Now Amar only has to go
see the doctor once in six months.

1265
01:55:51,041 --> 01:55:52.416
He's recovering so well.

1266
01:55:54,291 --> 01:55:56.291
Taran, the network is really bad.

1267
01:55:57,166 --> 01:55:59.916
But congratulations,
I am happy for you.

1268
01:56:00,791 --> 01:56:01.916
And Amar.

1269
01:56:03,041 --> 01:56:06.291
Anyway, I'll speak to you
later..whenever you get the time.

1270
01:56:06,375 --> 01:56:08.375
Yeah, okay. Bye.

1271
01:56:08,875 --> 01:56:10.166
Yeah, bye.

1272
01:56:55,541 --> 01:56:56.666
Taran..

1273
01:56:59,458 --> 01:57:01.541
..let's not meet for few days.

1274
01:57:05,666 --> 01:57:07.750
It's not Shekhar's fault..

1275
01:57:08,458 --> 01:57:10.500
..but, anyone can feel bad.

1276
01:57:20,541 --> 01:57:21.625
See you..

1277
01:57:23,416 --> 01:57:25.791
I am so happy you're
recovering so quickly.

1278
01:57:26,958 --> 01:57:28.041
This isn't done.

1279
01:57:28,708 --> 01:57:31.500
If you're angry,
call up..talk..fight.

1280
01:57:31,875 --> 01:57:33.250
This is absurd.

1281
01:57:33,416 --> 01:57:35.250
His phone's switched
off..and he's missing.

1282
01:57:36,708 --> 01:57:41.083
She hasn't slept all night..and now,
we've to go look for him.

1283
01:57:43,208 --> 01:57:44.708
I can't reach him.

1284
01:57:45,041 --> 01:57:46.666
Maybe his phone's not working.

1285
01:57:46,875 --> 01:57:49.125
It's not the phone,
but his mind that isn't working!

1286
01:57:49,291 --> 01:57:50.416
Even last night..

1287
01:57:50,666 --> 01:57:52.500
Let's talk about this later.

1288
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55.791
When? He's been missing for two days.

1289
01:57:55,958 --> 01:57:57.000
You know..

1290
01:57:57,125 --> 01:57:59.125
Let's not speak in front of her,
it'll upset her.

1291
01:58:42,583 --> 01:58:43.875
Hi, Taran.

1292
01:58:45,125 --> 01:58:45.916
Hi.

1293
01:58:52,458 --> 01:58:54.500
- Gurpreet..come on.
- Sorry..

1294
01:58:54,875 --> 01:58:58.833
Sorry, my friend came over and..

1295
01:58:59,166 --> 01:59:00.916
..we went out to watch the game.

1296
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:03.291
We had some beer.

1297
01:59:09,541 --> 01:59:10.666
Where is Amar?

1298
01:59:12,083 --> 01:59:13.083
Where's Amar?

1299
01:59:16,958 --> 01:59:18.791
Aahh..he sleeps early.

1300
01:59:19,791 --> 01:59:21.458
Did he take his meds?

1301
01:59:22,083 --> 01:59:23.958
Did he?

1302
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:27.708
He must have.

1303
01:59:28,833 --> 01:59:33.125
Anyway, I think it's quite late,
we should get going.

1304
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:39.166
I am okay.
I am fine.

1305
01:59:39,375 --> 01:59:41.750
- You're not fine.
- I am fine.

1306
01:59:41,916 --> 01:59:43.833
- Not fine.
- I said I am fine!

1307
01:59:44,541 --> 01:59:45.875
- I am fine.
- Shekhar, enough.

1308
01:59:46,250 --> 01:59:47.583
Enough what, Taran?

1309
01:59:48,541 --> 01:59:49.541
Enough what?

1310
01:59:49,708 --> 01:59:51.541
I want to tell you enough.

1311
01:59:51,791 --> 01:59:53.750
Did I tell you to love me?

1312
01:59:54,041 --> 01:59:56.708
Did I tell you not to love Amar?

1313
01:59:57,250 --> 02:00:01.791
But..you told Amar, that you love me.

1314
02:00:02,541 --> 02:00:03.500
Yes.

1315
02:00:05,541 --> 02:00:06.125
I did.

1316
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:07.291
Yeah..

1317
02:00:09,416 --> 02:00:11.166
Come on,
Shekhar..let's talk tomorrow.

1318
02:00:11,625 --> 02:00:12.916
I don't want to talk.

1319
02:00:14,125 --> 02:00:15.125
I am going.

1320
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:17.541
Forever.

1321
02:00:18,666 --> 02:00:21.458
- Shekhar, let's..
- I said I don't want to talk.

1322
02:00:21,541 --> 02:00:24.541
Enough, son.
That's enough for today.

1323
02:00:25,541 --> 02:00:27.541
You want to go home, go home.

1324
02:00:28,625 --> 02:00:30.291
You can speak with Taran tomorrow.

1325
02:00:37,541 --> 02:00:38.416
Shekhar.

1326
02:00:41,458 --> 02:00:42.333
Brother..

1327
02:01:07,875 --> 02:01:09.375
He's not that kind of a guy.

1328
02:01:10,250 --> 02:01:11.583
I can't believe this.

1329
02:01:13,041 --> 02:01:13.750
I know.

1330
02:01:52,583 --> 02:01:54.041
Who is Shekhar, Taran?

1331
02:02:00,625 --> 02:02:02.458
He's not the son of my friend.

1332
02:02:04,916 --> 02:02:05.875
I lied.

1333
02:02:13,458 --> 02:02:15.291
He suddenly showed
up one day out of nowhere.

1334
02:02:22,666 --> 02:02:25.208
Both of us were in a place
where we shouldn't have been.

1335
02:02:34,750 --> 02:02:36.625
It wasn't his fault either, sir.

1336
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39.333
Nor was it mine.

1337
02:02:53,291 --> 02:02:56.791
I was right behind you two
when you were looking for him.

1338
02:02:59,416 --> 02:03:00.583
Waiting..

1339
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:03.708
I was waiting too..

1340
02:03:05,291 --> 02:03:06.458
..for Amar to be found.

1341
02:03:08,125 --> 02:03:10.125
And get this big load off my chest.

1342
02:03:11,416 --> 02:03:13.625
Truth takes up a lot
of space in your heart, sir.

1343
02:03:15,583 --> 02:03:16.625
There's no way to accommodate it.

1344
02:03:23,833 --> 02:03:24.958
I couldn't take it anymore.

1345
02:03:26,166 --> 02:03:29.125
I thought I should tell you the truth.

1346
02:03:31,250 --> 02:03:32.875
Unwillingly..

1347
02:03:34,333 --> 02:03:37.250
..I snatched the most valuable thing
from yours and Taran's life.

1348
02:03:39,958 --> 02:03:41.375
I have no one..

1349
02:03:42,250 --> 02:03:43.416
..so I'll do whatever you say.

1350
02:03:45,958 --> 02:03:47.375
Take me to the police.

1351
02:03:48,333 --> 02:03:49.708
Kill me.

1352
02:03:51,083 --> 02:03:52.208
Make me your slave.

1353
02:03:55,250 --> 02:03:56.708
Or make me your son!

1354
02:04:06,125 --> 02:04:08.458
He had no reason to come here.

1355
02:04:09,458 --> 02:04:10.833
To tell the truth.

1356
02:04:13,666 --> 02:04:15.958
But from what I saw in his eyes..

1357
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20.541
..I felt he can be trusted.

1358
02:04:34,375 --> 02:04:35.250
All of us were..

1359
02:04:37,041 --> 02:04:41.208
..trying to deal with your accident,
in our own ways.

1360
02:04:45,583 --> 02:04:47.625
He wanted to deal with it too.

1361
02:04:50,208 --> 02:04:51.875
He wanted to help me.

1362
02:04:56,916 --> 02:04:59.208
But in a way,
he was asking for my help too.

1363
02:05:01,625 --> 02:05:03.916
In the beginning,
I would take him to the office.

1364
02:05:05,958 --> 02:05:09.916
In the evenings,
he would drop by for some coffee.

1365
02:05:10,250 --> 02:05:10.833
'Shekhar.'

1366
02:05:11,041 --> 02:05:12.041
- 'Hi.
- Hi.'

1367
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:23.000
I didn't realize..when he
became more like a son to me.

1368
02:05:50,041 --> 02:05:51.458
You can't find him now, son.

1369
02:06:22,291 --> 02:06:24.875
You're ok, you're fine.

1370
02:06:25,333 --> 02:06:26.958
Careful.

1371
02:07:02,666 --> 02:07:05.666
It's just this wound over
my left eye that hurts, otherwise..

1372
02:07:05,791 --> 02:07:07.541
Do you have any clue
how drunk you are?

1373
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09.583
And who drives after getting so high?

1374
02:07:09,875 --> 02:07:11.333
Are you a doctor or a cop?

1375
02:07:11,625 --> 02:07:12.750
Just do your job.

1376
02:07:19,166 --> 02:07:20.500
What are you doing?

1377
02:07:21,750 --> 02:07:23.416
You're hurting that poor girl.

1378
02:07:24,250 --> 02:07:25.750
A little pain now..

1379
02:07:28,041 --> 02:07:29.875
..will save her from
a lifetime of anguish.

1380
02:07:31,375 --> 02:07:33.000
Let me go, please.

1381
02:07:34,916 --> 02:07:36.583
You don't love her?

1382
02:07:39,791 --> 02:07:41.875
Love is not some relationship.

1383
02:07:44,333 --> 02:07:47.875
It's a ray of light
which offers a glimpse of God.

1384
02:07:50,583 --> 02:07:53.041
And I am listening to my God now.

1385
02:08:43,625 --> 02:08:44.750
- Hello, sir.
- Hi.

1386
02:08:44,958 --> 02:08:46.250
The aircraft is ready, sir.

1387
02:08:46,291 --> 02:08:48.416
Should be able to take
off in about 15 minutes.

1388
02:08:49,666 --> 02:08:51.208
I want to meet him.

1389
02:08:52,625 --> 02:08:55.125
I want him to tell
me what my fault was.

1390
02:08:55,625 --> 02:08:57.416
And then he can go
wherever he wants to.

1391
02:08:58,333 --> 02:09:00.500
- Taran..
- I want to meet him.

1392
02:09:00,958 --> 02:09:04.000
He can't do this. I want to meet him.

1393
02:09:04,416 --> 02:09:05.208
But..

1394
02:09:05,333 --> 02:09:07.416
He will take off in 15 minutes.

1395
02:09:09,708 --> 02:09:13.375
I don't know where he is going.

1396
02:09:15,958 --> 02:09:18.541
There's no chance of
getting there in 15 minutes.

1397
02:09:19,083 --> 02:09:20.458
- Traffic..
- Harry..

1398
02:09:20,666 --> 02:09:21.541
Can't make it.

1399
02:09:23,208 --> 02:09:25.333
Taran's question is important.

1400
02:09:26,208 --> 02:09:28.291
I will get her there in 15 minutes.

1401
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:30.458
But I need your help, please.

1402
02:10:48,333 --> 02:10:49.166
Shekhar.

1403
02:11:09,625 --> 02:11:12.000
Don't do this to her.

1404
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17.750
First she grieved for me..

1405
02:11:19,125 --> 02:11:20.583
..now she will grieve for you.

1406
02:11:21,416 --> 02:11:24.708
Please..what is her fault?

1407
02:11:33,875 --> 02:11:34.958
I know..

1408
02:11:36,458 --> 02:11:38.166
..who you are.

1409
02:11:39,083 --> 02:11:40.291
We all do.

1410
02:11:43,125 --> 02:11:45.375
But we still love you.

1411
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:55.666
That's the problem..

1412
02:11:57,833 --> 02:11:59.250
..everyone loves me.

1413
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03.541
Otherwise it was so easy.

1414
02:12:04,375 --> 02:12:08.708
I would've quietly escaped..

1415
02:12:09,125 --> 02:12:10.416
..to my world.

1416
02:12:19,666 --> 02:12:21.291
Why did you show up again?

1417
02:12:22,708 --> 02:12:24.625
You made this all the
more difficult for me to leave.

1418
02:12:25,541 --> 02:12:26.875
Why do you want to go, Shekhar?

1419
02:12:27,750 --> 02:12:29.916
You had your own
world before I arrived.

1420
02:12:30,333 --> 02:12:32.291
And now you have that back.

1421
02:12:33,916 --> 02:12:35.916
And there's no place
for Shekhar in that world.

1422
02:12:36,625 --> 02:12:39.125
Will you decide whom I love?

1423
02:12:41,458 --> 02:12:46.583
Only I have that
right.. me.. not you.

1424
02:12:48,125 --> 02:12:50.041
If I had that right..

1425
02:12:52,208 --> 02:12:54.416
..then you could've
never loved someone else.

1426
02:12:55,875 --> 02:12:59.250
Not now..or in the next
lifetime..or after that.

1427
02:13:00,625 --> 02:13:01.625
Then why?

1428
02:13:04,375 --> 02:13:06.083
I just want to tell you..

1429
02:13:06,333 --> 02:13:12.583
What you're doing is completely
different from what you want, Taran.

1430
02:13:13,125 --> 02:13:15.333
You didn't do anything wrong, Taran.

1431
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:21.000
The other day, in the temple,
when I asked you why you chose me..

1432
02:13:22,333 --> 02:13:25.666
..you said 'I am
doing the right thing'.

1433
02:13:28,625 --> 02:13:30.833
It's true that it's not my fault.

1434
02:13:32,666 --> 02:13:34.583
Also true that I love you.

1435
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41.958
Maybe more..

1436
02:13:43,875 --> 02:13:45.708
..than you know.

1437
02:13:49,291 --> 02:13:52.583
But not more than you love Amar.

1438
02:13:55,750 --> 02:13:57.625
Love is not some
responsibility, Taran.

1439
02:13:59,625 --> 02:14:01.000
Love is not reasonable.

1440
02:14:02,125 --> 02:14:03.833
It just happens.

1441
02:14:04,291 --> 02:14:05.875
Only compromises are reasonable.

1442
02:14:08,208 --> 02:14:09.291
Fine, I won't go.

1443
02:14:13,166 --> 02:14:15.375
Look into my eye and say..

1444
02:14:16,541 --> 02:14:18.041
..that you don't love Amar.

1445
02:14:21,208 --> 02:14:24.750
Say that every day you didn't
feel something shatter inside you..

1446
02:14:25,208 --> 02:14:27.291
..after you told Amar about me.

1447
02:14:33,458 --> 02:14:35.291
Say it Taran, and I won't go.

1448
02:14:37,833 --> 02:14:38.833
Say it..

1449
02:14:47,375 --> 02:14:49.416
Don't do the right thing, silly..

1450
02:14:50,875 --> 02:14:52.083
..fall in love.

1451
02:14:59,333 --> 02:15:00.916
It's my turn to do the right thing.

1452
02:15:04,291 --> 02:15:05.166
See you.

1453
02:15:40,208 --> 02:15:43.291
Smile..laugh..be happy..

1454
02:15:46,083 --> 02:15:46.875
Love..!
