3
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,857
What is life?
A subtle harmony of the five elements

4
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:06,609
What is my?
A mess in these elements

5
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:08,778
Pandit Brii Narayan Chakbast

6
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:04,834
Public toilets

7
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,461
A moment.

8
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:35,592
I have a gift for you.

9
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,346
Thank you.

10
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,216
It's okay?

11
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:21,679
It's kinda weird.

12
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:14,315
Open the door !

13
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:17,735
What is happening here?
Open!

14
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:23,574
My clothes ?

15
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:25,743
Open that door!

16
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,203
Good !

17
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,415
So this hotel has turned into a mess?

18
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:31,874
Well done !

19
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,711
Shall we go wild?
Let's start with you.

20
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:36,337
Go ahead!

21
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:38,923
Checked.
Your name?

22
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:41,134
Your name !

23
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,427
Piyush Agarwal.

24
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:45,179
- What are you running from?
- Sir, I'm a student.

25
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:46,472
Where do you come from?

26
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,849
Allahabad.

27
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,309
Is that what you study?

28
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:52,228
Sir, can we work it out?

29
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:54,605
Give him a good "arrangement"!

30
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:56,816
I arrange with Madame.

31
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:00,403
Your name?

32
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:02,113
Your name !

33
00:06:04,157 --> 00:06:06,034
- Speak !
- Devi.

34
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,661
So, Devi, you are well fucked!

35
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:10,913
Superb!

36
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,166
Catch that asshole! Where did he go?

37
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,876
Bring him out!

38
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:19,380
- Let's see the arrangement you want.
- No sir !

39
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:23,134
I am a student.
It's the first time.

40
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,179
Are you playing innocent? Open!

41
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:31,142
Open!

42
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,067
Find his wallet.

43
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,402
Open that damn door!

44
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:45,615
He's gonna open that motherfucker!

45
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:47,533
Search well.

46
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:50,870
Wait, that'll bring him out.

47
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:54,624
Father's name:Ramdhari Agarwal.

48
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:59,670
Emergency number:9415257547.

49
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:04,008
Go out or I call your father.

50
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:05,635
I want to go to the toilet.

51
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:08,971
You will shit in prison.
Your father's number is busy.

52
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:11,474
Please don't call my father!

53
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:13,559
We will call him back.

54
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:16,145
Are you from a Madvadi brothel?

55
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:17,647
Look at the device.

56
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:20,108
- No.
- From Nepal?

57
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:22,944
You are wrong !

58
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:25,154
Is that so ? Are we wrong?

59
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,202
Open,
or we drag you naked in the street!

60
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:32,453
Open!

61
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,373
What are you waiting for?

62
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,917
Kill that damn door!

63
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:40,169
Open!

64
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:43,172
What the hell is he doing?

65
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,633
Open the door !

66
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:47,468
Are you standing idly by?

67
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:48,803
Break down the door!

68
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:54,225
Holy shit!

69
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:55,685
Sir!

70
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:58,354
Come to see !

71
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,356
What now?

72
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,153
Pandey! An ambulance !

73
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:06,988
- Piyush ...
- Quickly !

74
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:13,202
Slowly.

75
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:18,207
Be careful, he's bleeding a lot.

76
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:36,184
Get her dressed, we'll take her on board.

77
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:47,612
What are you watching?

78
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,388
THE PYRE

79
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:23,189
My son, are you back home?

80
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:25,316
I'll bring you a glass of water.

81
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:26,984
Do not bother,
I will help myself.

82
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,444
I give you some.

83
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,914
Mother, we must light the stove.

84
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:43,626
Go find the sacred fire of the ghât.

85
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:48,881
Also wake up Sikandar.
He has to go to work.

86
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,175
Bro

87
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,469
Bro...

88
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:55,513
Sikandar ...

89
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:57,306
Hey, brother!

90
00:09:57,473 --> 00:09:59,725
Mom sends me to wake you up.

91
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:01,686
Standing !

92
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:11,862
<i> Ram, the name of God
is the eternal truth ... </i>

93
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,218
- I bring fire to mom, I come back.
- What about Sikandar?

94
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:35,970
He's up, he's coming.

95
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:49,734
Hey, Motilal!

96
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,653
- Join us.
- I can't leave my shop.

97
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,947
Your shop! We won't steal anything from you!

98
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:58,617
They brought us this,
they are from the university. Tell him.

99
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,620
Sir, we have
an anthropological project.

100
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:06,000
They want history and tradition
of our ghats. Enlighten them.

101
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,419
You are the scholar of our ghats!

102
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:10,963
And you, the one in our alleys!

103
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,840
Shady alleys at night, eh?

104
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,634
You save?

105
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:18,721
Yes, we forget details
taking notes.

106
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,516
The story...

107
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:26,270
Formerly, on the banks of the Ganges,
our mother,

108
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,938
stretched the jungle.

109
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,941
The ritual of the pyres was born
on the sacred Ganges.

110
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:35,237
Many kings
established their ghât here.

111
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:39,367
Priests from all provinces
settled there.

112
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,868
Each ghât

113
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:44,455
is allocated according to the regions,
castes and priests.

114
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:46,165
You see ?

115
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:48,793
The ghât where we are sitting

116
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,212
is controversial.

117
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:53,005
- Like Kashmir.
- Yes.

118
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,424
People of Maharashtra
claim it.

119
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:58,177
Like those of Gudjerat,

120
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:01,389
What are we going to do with him?

121
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:05,226
Here is Jhonta, the hero of the ghats,
who wants to become president.

122
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:09,021
But to bring me customers,
no need to rely on him.

123
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:10,773
- So what?
- I was going to do it!

124
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:13,609
Bring my phone. Hurry up !

125
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:17,279
The neighboring ghât is that of Scindia.

126
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,908
I am going to look for clients.

127
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:24,829
Kids today are in a hurry.
They don't stop.

128
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:28,332
The phone doesn't stop either.

129
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,293
Calvary of modern times!

130
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,549
It's me.

131
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:40,761
They are ingenious.

132
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:43,806
Madame has put herself in suri
and made herself beautiful.

133
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,808
They hardly know each other,

134
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,476
and forward!

135
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,353
Why?

136
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,066
What did you tell us?

137
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:57,153
Repeat it.
Explain to your father.

138
00:12:58,404 --> 00:13:01,449
What are you saying
"Out of curiosity".

139
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:05,327
If I tell a journalist about it go will make the headlines.

140
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:11,333
What's this ?

141
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,794
A file for another service?

142
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,629
What does it mean?

143
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,507
Are you not paying attention?
Get out !

144
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:23,596
Can you tell me your name again?

145
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:25,764
Pathak.

146
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:30,936
Vidhyadhar Pathak.

147
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:36,484
I give rituals
at the Nandeshwar ghât.

148
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:41,614
I used to teach Sanskrit
at University.

149
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,033
I also translate books.

150
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,160
We'll call you back in three days.

151
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,787
For now, pay the deposit,

152
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:50,956
and take your daughter.

153
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:55,085
Mr. Mishra ...
What does "for now" mean?

154
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:02,968
If the boy dies, she is an accomplice
of a suicide, of a crime.

155
00:14:05,221 --> 00:14:06,222
Court

156
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:09,308
media, you will have to face it all.

157
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,686
Don't beg me! Pay the deposit.

158
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,647
Consider that we are alike ...

159
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,440
Pay the deposit and get out!

160
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,655
Centrifugal force was used,
centripetal force.

161
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,865
And we find ourselves stuck.

162
00:16:30,783 --> 00:16:32,326
So we explore upwards.

163
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:36,246
And here we are
in the world of civil engineering.

164
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,498
Questions?

165
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,628
How many months of study do you have left?

166
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,506
Two more months, dad.

167
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:48,384
Then the exams, and the internship.

168
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,969
- The what?
- The internship, for a job.

169
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:54,056
Do we have to pay to get hired?

170
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:55,974
Not anymore, mom.

171
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,477
Railways and electricity

172
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:00,187
hire by competition.

173
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:14,243
You should not
monitor ash filtering?

174
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,370
What if the kids steal the money?

175
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:17,830
Uncle Shambhu is there.

176
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:19,790
Shambhu is still high.

177
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,709
So what ! I have the right to eat?

178
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,054
How much will you earn?

179
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,683
I will find out after my interview.

180
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,435
It's good. Leave here.

181
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:43,272
The earliest would be best.

182
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:48,819
Otherwise even you will end your life
among the burning bodies.

183
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:55,701
A wafer !

184
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:06,128
I found that, is it in silver?

185
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:23,979
Hello Master !

186
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:25,814
I took my bath early!

187
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:36,033
Weren't you there for 3 days?

188
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,620
Shut up and do your job.

189
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:01,183
Is your father here?

190
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,560
He is on the ghât.

191
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:05,187
Call him.

192
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,477
The boy is dead.

193
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:08,125
Did you offer her some tea?

194
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:10,878
Sit down.

195
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,171
Sorry to keep you waiting.

196
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,512
Mr. Pathak, the boy is dead.

197
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,348
The body is autopsied,

198
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:25,434
the report will not delay.

199
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:28,270
Here are the court papers.

200
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:30,480
Please fill them out.

201
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:31,732
Wait...

202
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:36,361
How does the tribunal affect us?

203
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:38,906
It is a complicity in suicide.

204
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,079
But, sir ... the boy ...

205
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:49,666
He killed himself in front of your eyes.

206
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,085
Under your intimidation.

207
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,885
Are you lecturing me, professor?

208
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:02,220
Listen carefully...

209
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:07,225
Save your sermons for
your client wankers on the ghats.

210
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,061
Including?

211
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,980
Haven't you seen it on TV?

212
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,858
R.K. Puram's sex scandals,
and Jammu and Kashmir.

213
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,486
Now your daughter is part

214
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:19,321
of a beautiful sex scandal.

215
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:23,575
Sir, tell us how to do it.

216
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,251
What is your monthly income?

217
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,299
I earn 8-10,000 rupees.

218
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,177
She works too?

219
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,722
Yes, in computer science.

220
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:49,518
I'll get right to the point.

221
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,689
Complicity,

222
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:58,151
media, court,
I can take care of everything.

223
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,028
But you have to work it out.

224
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:03,782
300,000 rupees in 3 installments.
I'll leave you 3 months.

225
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,619
No, you are wrong.

226
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,455
We have principles.

227
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:14,710
And we wouldn't even have 50,000.

228
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,963
From now on...
Never again...

229
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,632
Never negotiate with me again!

230
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,803
I come to sell a bar of soap

231
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:31,601
I am here to save your honor.

232
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:39,651
I have the video of the sex scandal
of your daughter.

233
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:42,195
Just put it on the Internet,

234
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:46,408
then no one in Benares
won't let go of your daughter!

235
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,829
Find 100,000 within 2 days.

236
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,124
Don't nod your head
like a horse!

237
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,418
You are going to do what?

238
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:00,672
Find 100,000 in 2 days.

239
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:02,841
And in 2 months?

240
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:06,178
200,000.

241
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,305
Easy to understand, right?

242
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:30,577
Where are you going?

243
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:35,332
- At the cremation ghât.
- It's forbidden for women.

244
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,003
You have to hit the skull 5 times.

245
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:48,470
Piyush!

246
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,185
Deepak, go help him!

247
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,272
Piyush, my son.

248
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:04,277
The skull must burst
for the soul to escape.

249
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:18,750
That's 26 rupees.

250
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,378
Where do they come from?

251
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:25,090
I dived while holding back
my breath very long!

252
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:26,383
So what?

253
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,510
Let me participate!

254
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:32,806
Are you asking me to let you bet?

255
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:36,268
It's not a bet, it's sport.
And I am a pro!

256
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:39,563
So shut up.
Don't you have a job to do?

257
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:42,607
You got fucked
by a bull, or what?

258
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:46,695
It's Pooja with my teddy bear.

259
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:48,697
Cute, eh?

260
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:51,992
You can ask him
the name of this girl?

261
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:53,952
How do I do it?

262
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,997
"Pooja, my mate is crazy
from your girlfriend

263
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:58,874
"who goes to your poetry reading.

264
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,669
"Tell him his name so that he invites him."

265
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:05,046
Shall we send a request?

266
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:07,257
Deepak is quite exhilarated.

267
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:08,466
As they say ...

268
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:12,637
All night long the mango was shaken,
but when the time came she fell.

269
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,806
What's the matter with you?

270
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:17,767
Good listening.

271
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,644
You remember her?

272
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,481
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

273
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:26,860
Be serious.

274
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:29,654
Girls' college B.N. Roi.
She must be there.

275
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:33,450
Will you find it in Pooja's album?

276
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:36,328
Yes she must be
in his friend list.

277
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:38,246
It's her?

278
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,125
There it is!

279
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:45,795
Shaalu Gupta.

280
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,297
Gupta, the class!

281
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:48,757
Cool, man!

282
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:53,345
Open a Facebook account,
and let the fireworks begin!

283
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:57,057
You understand?
Send him a request.

284
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:58,767
We did it?

285
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:01,186
Yes.

286
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:07,108
Come closer, everyone!
Earn lots of money, and fast!

287
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:13,365
In a few minutes, 10 rupees
bring in 50! And 50 is 200!

288
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:17,827
These young people will dive
to bring back coins.

289
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:21,456
Bet on the one who will bring back
the most coins!

290
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:23,917
20 on Loku, it is noted.

291
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:26,253
Do not hesitate ! Place your bets!

292
00:26:26,878 --> 00:26:29,547
20 rupees on Netwa.

293
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:33,510
Let the competition begin!

294
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:35,178
... 2 ...

295
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,523
Go!
Let's see who brings back the most coins!

296
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,316
Gentlemen, take a good look!

297
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:50,360
Loku brought back 3 coins.

298
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:51,736
Netwa! Faster !

299
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:54,948
Babua only brought back one piece.

300
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:57,909
Munna had 3 coins at once.

301
00:26:58,076 --> 00:26:59,661
Hold your breath!

302
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:02,539
- Boss, let me go!
- No, you're watching.

303
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:04,207
Please I want to go!

304
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:07,502
What an exciting competition!
Did you bet well?

305
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:11,548
Those who bet on Munna
see their earnings triple!

306
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:14,384
Sikandar!

307
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:17,137
Throw your leg in the stake, asshole!

308
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:22,183
Sikandar!

309
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,352
Looks like the old man is drunk.

310
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:27,856
A glass,
king of the Dom community!

311
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:30,025
Another for you prosperity!

312
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:36,781
Do I look like a king?

313
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:40,368
Let's see! There are only two kings
in Benares.

314
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:44,205
One is Kushi Nuresh,
the other the king of the Dom.

315
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:45,832
One on the other side,

316
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,709
the other on this side.

317
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,753
Look at poor Shambhu.

318
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:54,758
How many bonus days per year?

319
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:56,217
Hey ! Shambhu!

320
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:58,928
Yes sir !

321
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,556
One every ten years.

322
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:05,352
Shambhu has a bonus day
once every ten years.

323
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:07,771
So...

324
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,523
That day...

325
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:15,195
all cremation earnings
comes back to him.

326
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:19,032
Shambhu's father

327
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:23,620
was touching his bonus day
once a year.

328
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:26,831
He was fulfilled and he had ten children.

329
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,250
The bonus has been shared.

330
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:35,090
His dad had a bonus day
per year,

331
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:38,593
Shambhu inherited
of the tenth of the bonus.

332
00:28:39,177 --> 00:28:43,807
Today, Shambhu touches
a bonus every ten years.

333
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:48,228
When will your next one, Shambhu?

334
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:49,521
I have no more!

335
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:54,109
I sold my bonus rights to Lulu.

336
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:57,112
He paid me 100,000 rupees.

337
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,532
I will live on alms the rest of my life.

338
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:02,909
If I sell my bonus,

339
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:04,828
I will have a million rupees.
Isn't that right, Lulu?

340
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,080
As if you were going to sell them to me!

341
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:08,456
Should we sell?

342
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:10,583
Are you asking your son for advice?

343
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,961
Our ghât does not concern him!

344
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:15,130
The educated man is an asshole!

345
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:18,675
Are you insulting my son?
I will never sell you my bonus!

346
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:21,428
But you never thought about it!

347
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:23,847
Dad,

348
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:27,016
I need money
for the Durga Puja party.

349
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:29,102
Take in my shirt.

350
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:31,479
300 rupees, will it be okay?

351
00:29:31,646 --> 00:29:33,231
Take what you want.

352
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,358
You are my Everything.

353
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,598
Will you finally explain yourself?

354
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:10,602
What do you want to hear?

355
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:12,770
I want to know.

356
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:17,442
Who was he ? What happened?

357
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:21,446
I saw him at the computer center.

358
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:25,492
I was typing his study report.

359
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:28,495
We became friends, that's it.

360
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:34,792
And that's all?

361
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:37,879
Yes.

362
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:40,298
I liked talking to him.

363
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:47,514
You didn't think twice
before doing it?

364
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,391
Not even once?

365
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:51,976
Huh?

366
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,811
Answer!

367
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,485
What?

368
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:09,077
- You heard?
- I do not know!

369
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:15,583
A boy has just died.

370
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,920
We have a ransom of 300,000 on our back.

371
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:21,464
I liquidated my savings of 100,000.

372
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:24,133
You're on the verge of going to jail.

373
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,469
And you answer:"I don't know."

374
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:31,849
Friend request sent

375
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:39,399
You come to the Durga Puja party,
tonight ?

376
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:15,226
That's 20 rupees.

377
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:26,571
Put this watch in the hat.

378
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:28,781
Slowly ! Yes, in the hat.

379
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:30,450
The watch is in the hat.

380
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:32,952
Now blow into the hat.

381
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:36,122
And see now, the watch ...

382
00:32:36,873 --> 00:32:38,207
The watch is gone!

383
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:41,836
The watch will reappear

384
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:44,464
in the pocket of someone among you!

385
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,132
She's on him!

386
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:47,967
The man in the red shirt!

387
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,261
Yes you ! Check your pockets.

388
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:51,888
We found the watch!

389
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:54,432
Take the stage, young man!

390
00:32:56,434 --> 00:32:57,518
What is your name?

391
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:58,728
Deepak.

392
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:19,916
I will no longer smoke.
Yesterday my friends forced me to do it.

393
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:45,126
Shaalu agrees to be your friend.
Write to him on his wall.

394
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:53,843
With my qualifications,
I deserve at least 12000 per month.

395
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,637
Don't negotiate!
He was one of my favorite students.

396
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:59,432
He was our teacher
all of our schooling.

397
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,352
What we are today
we owe it to him.

398
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,021
Bring some tea.

399
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:07,231
No thanks. I do not have time.

400
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:09,609
I have a book translation to finish.

401
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:12,445
A glass of water?
From the canister.

402
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:16,449
I have received your CV.

403
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:18,367
For the moment,

404
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:20,828
we have no instructor position.

405
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:22,705
The receptionist is free.

406
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:26,167
Welcome and advice
to new students.

407
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:29,962
And a database job
paid in addition.

408
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:32,089
In all, 5.5K rupees per month.

409
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:33,925
Perfect !

410
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:36,969
It starts tomorrow.
Thanks a lot, Sanjay.

411
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,639
Sir, that's the least of it.

412
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,474
Excuse me, I have to answer.

413
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:44,393
Drink.
The pottery of our bottle

414
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:47,021
gives it a very good taste.

415
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:54,862
He gives just 5500.

416
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:58,282
You saw how he respects me.

417
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:03,704
Thank you.

418
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:13,214
Are you in a polytechnic school?

419
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:14,257
Yes.

420
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:17,343
Civil engineering. In the last year.

421
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:22,557
We had a strike for a year,

422
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:24,725
otherwise I would already have a job.

423
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:28,437
What are your hobbies?

424
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:30,731
The music.

425
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:32,358
- You sing?
- No.

426
00:36:32,692 --> 00:36:37,238
I'm listening to music
on the radio, on CDs.

427
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:39,448
Only the music?

428
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:41,158
And I really like poetry!

429
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:42,743
- Poetry?
- Yes.

430
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,287
Bashir Badr ...

431
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:46,873
Akbar Allahabadi, Mirza Ghalib ...

432
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:49,000
Ghalib, do you know?

433
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:52,169
Yes finally...

434
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:57,049
Thank you.

435
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:01,262
Boy! Can we have some sauce?

436
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:02,805
Szechuan sauce?

437
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:04,807
Can you bring some?

438
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:07,268
- Get started.
- No you !

439
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:08,811
You first.

440
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:15,026
Well...

441
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:17,194
We're friends, aren't we?

442
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:29,206
By the way,

443
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:34,378
if one day you get into trouble,
say it to me.

444
00:37:36,881 --> 00:37:38,090
What will you do?

445
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:41,969
I will solve the problem.

446
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:44,221
If someone bothers you,

447
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:46,557
laughs, makes you cry ...

448
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:49,268
There are <i> bad boys </i> around here.

449
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:50,770
Okay.

450
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,732
What if ever ...

451
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:59,070
What if I cry because of you?

452
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:00,613
I? No why?

453
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:09,163
Again, I will solve the problem.

454
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:14,669
Student's name
in capital letters, please.

455
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:18,589
Here is our brochure with a free CD.

456
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:20,257
All the information is there.

457
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:23,511
Take them and come back tomorrow.
We will register your son.

458
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:24,971
- Okay.
- Thank you.

459
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:36,315
You can talk well.

460
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:39,568
Is this your first job?

461
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:42,029
No.

462
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,075
What happened?

463
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:48,536
I didn't like the job.

464
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:52,581
I know what you were doing.

465
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:02,425
Enter the face game!

466
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:05,761
Yes are these actors.
Guess and answer!

467
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:10,099
<i> Among the correct answers,
a car to win! </i>

468
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:12,309
Our standard is open.

469

Here is Jhonta, a new diver!

478
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:49,698
Who will bring back the most coins?

479
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:58,207
Jhonta is doing very well!

480
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,626
Place the pieces here.

481
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:03,921

00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,733
born in Allahabad.

488
00:41:29,363 --> 00:41:30,781
He is dead.

489
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:33,284
A tragic death.

490
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:35,995
I heard it say.

491
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:41,417
I am from the center where he was in training.

492
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:43,544
These documents were his.

493
00:41:43,711 --> 00:41:46,422
And he owed money.

494
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:49,300
He also had books to return ...

495
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:53,721
Could I have his address?

496
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,973
Get out! The contest is over!

four hundred ninety seven

497
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,684
Who has the most coins?

498
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:00,394
Hey, Munna!

00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:02,313
Tell us who is the winner!

500
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:03,856

- You were wonderful.

502
00:42:11,614 --> 00:42:14,617
Father of Piyush:Ramdhari Agarwal

503
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,554
Hide these stars in my eyes
May they be safe there

504
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:38,891
<i> the night will be long to last </i>

505
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:41,810
travelers like the two of us

506
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:43,729
Will cross on a path

507
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:47,316
Maybe in the sailor's light

508
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:49,902
Then?

509
00:42:50,236 --> 00:42:51,237
Then?

510
00:42:51,654 --> 00:42:53,322
How? 'Or' What? That's all.

511
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:54,531
Sorry,

512
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:58,077
I am not there.
What I understood is very beautiful!

513
00:42:58,494 --> 00:43:00,162
You are stupid !

514
00:43:02,957 --> 00:43:04,041
And adorable.

515
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:05,584
What? What?

516
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:07,294
I said nothing.

517
00:43:08,045 --> 00:43:09,380
But I heard!

518
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:12,007
You will faint
if I read Chakbast.

519
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:18,264
Is it going to be your birthday?
I saw it on Facebook.

520
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:19,598
Is that so?

521
00:43:19,765 --> 00:43:21,725
Facebook doesn't say it all.

522
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:23,102
What?

523
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:24,687
A picnic.

524
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:26,230
Shaalu?

525
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:29,733
My mother asks me. I will call back.

526
00:43:30,276 --> 00:43:31,193
By the way !

527
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:33,028
Yes.

528
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:36,865
You must call me by my first name
and be familiar with each other.

529
00:43:39,243 --> 00:43:41,704
If you remember two poems.

530
00:43:42,121 --> 00:43:44,331
I'll decide after. I have to go.

531
00:43:44,498 --> 00:43:45,332
Hello?

532
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:46,500
Goodbye.

533
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,175
A poem by Dushyant Kumar.

534
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:57,845
You are like the train at the misty dawn

535
00:43:58,012 --> 00:44:00,597
I shook like a shaken bridge

536
00:44:00,764 --> 00:44:03,225
In the immense forest of your eyes

537
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:05,644
Little by little my way is lost

538
00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:07,438
Yes is on the device?

539
00:44:08,105 --> 00:44:10,316
May I speak <i> to </i> Mr. Ramdhari Agarwal?

540
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:12,234
It's me. Yes are you?

541
00:44:14,403 --> 00:44:16,405
I ... I ...

542
00:44:18,115 --> 00:44:19,742
What do you want ?

543
00:44:20,826 --> 00:44:23,370
This is the Kashi Cooperative Bank.

544
00:44:23,537 --> 00:44:25,414
Our new products ...

545
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:28,208
I don't want anything, thank you!

546
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:57,029
I'm telling you bluntly.

547
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:00,115
I want fucker.

548
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:01,784
Okay?

549
00:45:02,826 --> 00:45:04,578
No one will know.

550
00:45:05,287 --> 00:45:06,663
He was fucking you too.

551
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:12,294
It's good quality, look.

552
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:15,381
- It's way too expensive.
- But no !

553
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:18,467
I'll give you a discount. 320 rupees.

554
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:22,346
Leave. You think
and come back to buy it.

555
00:45:22,513 --> 00:45:23,680
Okay?

556
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:29,853
I resigned.

557
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:33,732
Hey, Pathak!

558
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:36,151
Your daughter did not come
since a long time.

559
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:37,569
Hello.

560
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:43,033
Go away.

561
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:45,702
What?

562
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:48,831
Do you want me to die of shame?

563
00:45:49,373 --> 00:45:50,332
Go away !

564
00:45:55,879 --> 00:45:58,549
Indian Railways Recruitment

565
00:45:58,715 --> 00:46:02,177
- What's going through your mind?
- Nothing.

566
00:46:02,678 --> 00:46:05,472
"Nothing", "I am not",
That's all you say !

567
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:07,391
Have I been hard on you?

568
00:46:08,517 --> 00:46:11,812
Haven't I given you enough freedom?
Answer!

569
00:46:11,979 --> 00:46:14,565
What did i do to you
to deserve such a scandal?

570
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:16,108
I did not cause a scandal.

571
00:46:16,275 --> 00:46:17,734
So what is it ?

572
00:46:19,153 --> 00:46:21,488
I'm trying to make ends meet.

573
00:46:21,655 --> 00:46:23,824
On the ghât, in the streets,

574
00:46:23,991 --> 00:46:27,536
I'm still scared
tell me about you.

575
00:46:27,703 --> 00:46:29,288
I am not afraid.

576
00:46:29,455 --> 00:46:32,499
I have decided not to live here anymore.

577
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:35,961
Small town, small vision of the world.

578
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:39,465
But you live here with dignity.
My vision of the world!

579
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,967
It's very caring, father!

580
00:46:42,426 --> 00:46:43,677
I'll pay the rent if I have to.

581
00:46:46,847 --> 00:46:47,848
Look at me.

582
00:46:48,015 --> 00:46:50,934
What do you want?
Are you looking for revenge?

583
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:52,686
Look at me. Avenge who?

584
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:54,146
Mom!

585
00:46:55,731 --> 00:46:57,941
Your mother.

586
00:46:59,693 --> 00:47:03,780
You don't even remember her.
You were only six years old!

587
00:47:03,947 --> 00:47:05,949
Is a six-year-old blind?

588
00:47:07,743 --> 00:47:10,037
I took her to the hospital, didn't I?

589
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:14,374
For two days she begged
to go <i> to </i> the hospital, but nothing.

590
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:16,043
Your students mattered more.

591
00:47:16,335 --> 00:47:17,628
You didn't do anything.

592
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:21,340
I thought it was a simple fever.
Afterwards, it was too late.

593
00:47:21,507 --> 00:47:23,133
Have I neglected you?

594
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,802
I left teaching for you!

595
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:29,515
I sold books
on the ghats for you!

596
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:30,891
I would have killed you mother?

597
00:47:31,058 --> 00:47:33,852
What about me, would I have killed this boy?

598
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:37,147
I killed him?

599
00:47:38,357 --> 00:47:39,983
He committed suicide!

600
00:47:44,321 --> 00:47:47,741
You're crazy.
You make false connections.

601
00:47:51,328 --> 00:47:53,121
I do not make any reconciliation.

602
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,167
I will defend my honor.

603
00:47:58,502 --> 00:47:59,795
I won't go to jail.

604
00:47:59,962 --> 00:48:02,130
You decided everything.

605
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:04,591
Me, poor idiot, I'm looking for the money.

606
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:07,177
I'll find the ransom.

607
00:48:07,344 --> 00:48:09,888
Now you don't need a father anymore.

608
00:48:11,098 --> 00:48:12,558
Do what you want.

609
00:48:14,184 --> 00:48:17,020
I shook like a shaken bridge

610
00:48:17,187 --> 00:48:19,731
In the immense forest of your eyes

611
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:21,692
Little by little my way is lost

612
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:25,612
I never thought about it.
I love them all.

613
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:28,991
How to love the seasons?

614
00:48:29,157 --> 00:48:31,368
I love the monsoon!

615
00:48:40,794 --> 00:48:42,588
Did you record it?

616
00:48:43,297 --> 00:48:47,217
Yes, on my phone.
And I added an old tube.

617
00:48:47,384 --> 00:48:50,721
Old man, you are surpassing your master!

618
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:53,307
Great gift!

619
00:48:55,225 --> 00:48:56,935
She is of high caste.

620
00:48:57,561 --> 00:48:59,062
Don't get carried away too quickly.

621
00:48:59,229 --> 00:49:01,690
She follows
that you are of lower caste?

622
00:49:05,235 --> 00:49:07,738
Tell him, and you'll see.

623
00:49:07,904 --> 00:49:09,865
Not everyone

not progressive.

624
00:49:10,032 --> 00:49:11,116
Yes,

625
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:13,452
I will tell him.

626
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:17,706
He has time.

627
00:49:17,873 --> 00:49:20,083
A good job will fix it all.

628
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,836
- Ruppan, give him the keys to your motorcycle.
- Why?

629
00:49:23,003 --> 00:49:24,630
He has another surprise for her.

630
00:49:24,796 --> 00:49:27,257
File the keys, he pays for gasoline.

631
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:29,426
First word.

632
00:49:30,218 --> 00:49:31,345
A plant?

633
00:49:32,179 --> 00:49:33,680
- A lamp?
- A bowl!

634
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:48,153
Deepak!

635
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,322
No, not the glow of a flame.

636
00:49:50,489 --> 00:49:51,281
Deepak!

637
00:50:19,226 --> 00:50:20,352
Where are we going?

638
00:50:21,103 --> 00:50:22,479
Where you want.

639
00:50:23,146 --> 00:50:24,314
Mounted.

640
00:50:25,899 --> 00:50:27,526
- Your bag?
- Sorry.

641
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:31,279
- I sit ?
- Yes go ahead.

642
00:50:34,908 --> 00:50:37,285
Do you know what we call your bus?

643
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:38,412
How? 'Or' What?

644
00:50:38,578 --> 00:50:40,205
The minettes' wagon.

645
00:50:48,672 --> 00:50:50,257
You haven't told me where you live.

646
00:50:57,139 --> 00:50:58,348
Do you see where Bhelupur is?

647
00:50:58,515 --> 00:51:00,976
- Bhelupur?
- Yes. Just after.

648
00:51:01,143 --> 00:51:02,853
My friend Prerna lives there.

649
00:51:04,271 --> 00:51:06,690
I will go to your place
on the pretext of seeing her.

650
00:51:06,857 --> 00:51:08,442
It will be funny, right?

651
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:13,238
You will come to my place?

652
00:51:13,405 --> 00:51:16,241
Will your parents let you out?

653
00:51:18,535 --> 00:51:19,828
If you do not want to...

654
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:21,371
No,

655
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:23,582
I didn't say go.

656
00:51:29,004 --> 00:51:31,006
Here go for a second.

657
00:51:35,343 --> 00:51:36,887
Your birthday present.

658
00:51:41,308 --> 00:51:42,517
Put the.

659
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:51,860
Can you hear well?

660
00:51:55,781 --> 00:51:56,656
Thank you.

661
00:52:35,612 --> 00:52:37,489
Have you ever been to Sangam?

662
00:52:39,032 --> 00:52:40,700
I have been here often.

663
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:51,545
In a few days,
we leave by bus for a pilgrimage.

664
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:54,923
We are all going <i> there </i>.
Uncle, aunt, grandfather, grandmother.

665
00:52:55,924 --> 00:52:57,342
Will you come too?

666
00:52:58,218 --> 00:52:59,719
- Or?
- With us.

667
00:52:59,886 --> 00:53:01,054
With your family?

668
00:53:05,684 --> 00:53:07,519
I have to think about it.

669
00:53:27,664 --> 00:53:28,790
What?

670
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,626
You're the youngest, aren't you?

671
00:53:32,961 --> 00:53:34,087
Yes.

672
00:53:34,254 --> 00:53:35,589
How do you know?

673
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,135
The little ones are still talking
wrongly and through.

674
00:53:42,971 --> 00:53:45,640
Ouch! Your hand is a real hammer!

675
00:53:45,974 --> 00:53:47,309
It's the ring.

676
00:53:49,269 --> 00:53:51,813
My uncle gave it to me
when I was little.

677
00:53:52,522 --> 00:53:53,690
She's stuck.

678
00:53:53,857 --> 00:53:55,358
My fingers have grown

679
00:53:55,525 --> 00:53:57,193
the ring has not moved.

680
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:01,197
As I am the youngest,
everyone likes me.

681
00:54:05,035 --> 00:54:06,202
Why are you looking at me like that?

682
00:54:07,329 --> 00:54:08,538
I do not know.

683
00:54:24,471 --> 00:54:26,932
You, the youngest one, I like you.

684
00:55:38,962 --> 00:55:40,255
Shaalu.

685
00:55:42,966 --> 00:55:44,634
You want to marry me?

686
00:55:48,888 --> 00:55:50,223
I do not know.

687
00:55:53,643 --> 00:55:55,353
Will your family accept?

688
00:55:56,396 --> 00:55:57,647
I do not know.

689
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:00,233
Do you want to see them?

690
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:02,027
Will you introduce me?

691
00:56:02,902 --> 00:56:04,988
You don't tell me your address,

692
00:56:05,155 --> 00:56:07,407
but do you want to come to my place?

693
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:31,681
I go.

694
00:56:31,848 --> 00:56:33,308
You live here?

695
00:56:34,684 --> 00:56:38,021
Just around the corner, the house on the left.

696
00:56:39,606 --> 00:56:40,648
And you house?

697
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,527
You said to Bhelupur ...

698
00:56:44,903 --> 00:56:46,071
Shivala?

699
00:56:48,531 --> 00:56:49,908
Kamacha!

700
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:51,826
Ah, I know.

701
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:54,370
- Durgakund, right?
- Why?

702
00:56:55,246 --> 00:56:56,289
What's the matter with you?

703
00:56:58,208 --> 00:57:02,253
I told you, near Bhelupur.
Can you talk about something else?

704
00:57:02,879 --> 00:57:03,880
I was joking...

705
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:05,840
Do you find it funny?

706
00:57:06,633 --> 00:57:09,803
Do you want to see where I live?
I'll take you there.

707
00:57:12,222 --> 00:57:15,809
You will be able to satisfy your curiosity.
Come on, get on.

708
00:57:16,643 --> 00:57:17,769
You want the truth?

709
00:57:17,936 --> 00:57:21,397
Ghat Harishchandra.
I live there and I was born there.

710
00:57:21,564 --> 00:57:24,067
Make the pyres, light them,
this is our job.

711
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,445
Me, my father, my brother, my uncles.
Always.

712
00:57:27,904 --> 00:57:30,281
Have you ever seen a burning body?

713
00:57:30,698 --> 00:57:33,034
Say, have you ever seen one burn?

714
00:57:33,201 --> 00:57:37,580
I see them from morning to night.
I burn bodies, night and day.

715
00:57:37,747 --> 00:57:41,668
In the fire, the skin is consumed.
The bones, the skull remain.

716
00:57:41,835 --> 00:57:46,548
We split the skull with a stick,
the ashes are filtered into the Ganges.

717
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:49,592
You imagine ? Do you want to come and see?

718
00:57:50,593 --> 00:57:53,221
Are you giving up your friend's pretext?

719
00:58:10,155 --> 00:58:12,073
I don't have a tip?

720
00:58:12,699 --> 00:58:13,575
Why?

721
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:18,204
A letter of employment from the government
deserves a good tip.

722
00:58:30,842 --> 00:58:33,469
Indian Railways Contract

723
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,149
Are you the new employee?

724
00:58:46,566 --> 00:58:47,567
Yes.

725
00:58:47,734 --> 00:58:48,943
Sit down.

726
00:59:12,675 --> 00:59:13,801
Ah, say ...

727
00:59:14,677 --> 00:59:17,847
If you were out
two minutes later,

728
00:59:18,014 --> 00:59:20,725
I would have given you my water bottle.

729
00:59:21,309 --> 00:59:22,810
By the way, I am Sadhya.

730
00:59:22,977 --> 00:59:24,103
Hello.

731
00:59:24,687 --> 00:59:26,898
Nice guide to ticket sales.

732
00:59:30,443 --> 00:59:33,821
We learned without a guide.
Not easy !

733
00:59:37,283 --> 00:59:38,159
Look.

734
00:59:38,534 --> 00:59:40,495
Mr. Mukherjee.

735
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:43,790
He worked here before you.

736
00:59:44,332 --> 00:59:46,209
He refused to learn computers.

737
00:59:46,376 --> 00:59:48,586
- Can I use it?
- Of course.

738
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:54,008
So the company transferred him
deep in Rajasthan.

739
00:59:54,926 --> 00:59:57,762
Now,
he sells the tickets <i> by </i> by hand.

740
00:59:59,389 --> 01:00:01,933
Do you know IT?

741
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:02,976
Yes.

742
01:00:03,518 --> 01:00:04,769
Very well.

743
01:00:04,936 --> 01:00:05,728
A note.

744
01:00:05,895 --> 01:00:06,729
Hello.

745
01:00:06,896 --> 01:00:08,523
- To go where?
- Lalpur.

746
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:30,253
Shaalu, your aunt is calling you.

747
01:00:44,517 --> 01:00:45,560
You know...

748
01:00:45,727 --> 01:00:47,979
You are different from other boys.

749
01:00:48,146 --> 01:00:49,939
In what ?

750
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:53,067
There is a certain honesty in you.

751
01:00:53,443 --> 01:00:56,195
Like the one in poetry
by Nida Fazli.

752
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:59,198
Yes, but who is Nida Fazli?

753
01:01:01,326 --> 01:01:03,328
There it is, your honesty!

754
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:08,666
It is very good.

755
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:10,626
Except the onions.

756
01:01:10,793 --> 01:01:12,587
The place is dirty.

757
01:01:13,921 --> 01:01:17,759
It's better if it's good,
the owner is from our caste.

758
01:01:44,952 --> 01:01:46,454
Are you finally calling?

759
01:01:46,621 --> 01:01:49,665
It was you who reacted badly
and you are mad at me?

760
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,043
Sorry.

761
01:01:52,502 --> 01:01:54,462
I'm not waiting for an apology.

762
01:01:55,129 --> 01:01:57,298
- I am stupid !
- That is true.

763
01:01:57,465 --> 01:01:59,759
I can't find the right words.

764
01:01:59,926 --> 01:02:01,219
That is also true.

765
01:02:03,096 --> 01:02:04,472
Where are you ?

766
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:08,267
<i> We haven't changed state yet.
We're getting there. </i>

767
01:02:08,935 --> 01:02:10,103
Listen...

768
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,605
My parents...

769
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:16,109
They ... won't accept you.

770
01:02:18,236 --> 01:02:22,407
They live in the past
with backward ideas.

771
01:02:23,408 --> 01:02:25,535
But I am on your side.

772
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:28,704
Over time, they will change their mind.

773
01:02:29,497 --> 01:02:32,291
Start by finding a good job.

774
01:02:34,335 --> 01:02:37,171
Yes, that's what I'm trying to do.

775
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,551
I will do my best during the internship.

776
01:02:42,718 --> 01:02:45,680
Yes, keep your spirits up!
I take care of the rest.

777
01:02:47,765 --> 01:02:51,018
I will not hesitate <i> to </i> run away with you.

778
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:54,188
Take care of yourself.

779
01:03:08,202 --> 01:03:10,329
Hey, KK! Let's go home!

780
01:03:10,496 --> 01:03:11,622
We just left.

781
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:14,000
I have my revisions to do.

782
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:16,419
We turn around!

783
01:03:18,254 --> 01:03:20,214
Other leaves, if Please.

784
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:25,928
I am in the last year
of civil engineering.

785
01:03:26,262 --> 01:03:29,098
<i> At the polytechnic
Seth Kinaram Agarwal </i>

786
01:03:29,265 --> 01:03:32,977
My goal is
an engineering career,

787
01:03:33,144 --> 01:03:35,897
specialized in industrial design.

788
01:03:36,063 --> 01:03:39,817
<i> - We're going home. I can not wait to see you.
- I'm going to have a job, come quickly. </i>

789
01:03:52,788 --> 01:03:54,499
There are many left
body <i> to </i> burn.

790
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:56,501
Push the skull into the fire.

791
01:03:58,377 --> 01:04:01,005
I'll go get Deepak.

792
01:04:03,174 --> 01:04:04,091
Deepak!

793
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:05,384
- What?
- Standing!

794
01:04:05,551 --> 01:04:08,387
Dad is still drunk.
There are <i> </i> lots of bodies.

795
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:10,640
Get up !

796
01:04:16,938 --> 01:04:19,023
Nobody bumps here!

797
01:04:19,315 --> 01:04:20,608
Hey, Deepak!

798
01:04:36,249 --> 01:04:39,043
Wait, you dirty thief!

799
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:43,172
The next time,
I throw you on a pyre!

800
01:04:56,519 --> 01:04:58,813
They didn't even cover the bodies.

801
01:04:59,605 --> 01:05:00,898
Hey, Shambhu!

802
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:02,567
Go up the pyres there.

803
01:05:03,025 --> 01:05:03,943
Yes, I'm going.

804
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:06,112
Take this body to the ritual bath.

805
01:05:06,279 --> 01:05:07,280
Deepak!

806
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,620
When you are done here
mounts pyres over there.

807
01:05:14,787 --> 01:05:15,830
Over there?

808
01:05:15,997 --> 01:05:18,249
Yes, at the edge. As much as you can.

809
01:05:18,416 --> 01:05:20,710
- Do I end up here first?
- Yes, quickly!

810
01:05:31,596 --> 01:05:33,222
We need more sawdust!

811
01:05:50,323 --> 01:05:52,408
Sikandar needs wood. Go ahead.

812
01:06:03,753 --> 01:06:06,005
Hey, Deepak!
Come help us.

813
01:06:21,312 --> 01:06:22,438
Warning.

814
01:06:25,274 --> 01:06:26,359
Slowly.

815
01:06:29,945 --> 01:06:31,739
Did the cops say something?

816
01:06:31,906 --> 01:06:36,619
The pilgrim bus had an accident,
he fell into the Ganges.

817
01:06:36,786 --> 01:06:37,620
Is that so?

818
01:06:37,787 --> 01:06:40,748
Utilities have left
the bodies here.

819
01:06:41,207 --> 01:06:42,875
Survivors?

820
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:44,085
No.

821
01:08:52,213 --> 01:08:53,756
You know...

822
01:08:55,341 --> 01:08:57,760
28 trains stop here every day.

823
01:08:57,927 --> 01:08:59,303
And how many do not stop there?

824
01:09:01,931 --> 01:09:03,224
64!

825
01:09:04,642 --> 01:09:06,977
It's easier to come here

826
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:08,521
than to start again!

827
01:09:14,443 --> 01:09:18,072
- Its very important.
- But it was strong drinks!

828
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:19,782
They are meant to be.

829
01:09:19,949 --> 01:09:21,992
Can't I drink as much as you?

830
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:23,577
I do not say that.

831
01:09:23,744 --> 01:09:25,287
Excuse me, could you ...

832
01:09:25,454 --> 01:09:28,040
Is this post confirmed?

833
01:09:28,207 --> 01:09:29,333
It was nice,

834
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:30,709
but we have to go home.

835
01:09:30,876 --> 01:09:32,086
One more day.

836
01:09:32,253 --> 01:09:33,671
No confirmation.

837
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:36,340
What about the last minute quota?

838
01:09:36,507 --> 01:09:38,092
A place for two would suit us.

839
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:40,386
One seat, I like it.

840
01:09:44,306 --> 01:09:46,267
Status:26 places available

841
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:50,604
I am not going back to this hotel!

842
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:52,565
No place.

843
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:54,567
- Cancellations?
- No.

844
01:09:55,109 --> 01:09:57,653
Shit !
What shall we do now?

845
01:10:48,662 --> 01:10:52,499
I am the father of Piyush.
You were at the hotel with him, huh?

846
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:56,670
- Answer!
- What are you doing? Give me the phone!

847
01:10:56,837 --> 01:10:59,423
<i> It's me speaking, come home! </i>

848
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:02,426
Were you with Piyush that day?
Answer!

849
01:11:09,183 --> 01:11:12,436
come to see
an exceptional competition,

850
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:14,730
like you will never see!

851
01:11:14,897 --> 01:11:15,981
Jhonta!

852
01:11:16,148 --> 01:11:18,150
Now ladies and gentlemen

853
01:11:18,317 --> 01:11:19,693
these kids are going to dive.

854
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:20,945
Jhonta!

855
01:11:21,111 --> 01:11:24,281
He is not there.
Bet on someone else.

856
01:11:24,865 --> 01:11:27,493
Bet on Babua, he's great.

857
01:11:28,077 --> 01:11:29,203
I bet on Babua.

858
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:30,871
- How many?
- 200 rupees.

859
01:11:31,038 --> 01:11:32,790
The professor bets 200 on Babua!

860
01:11:32,957 --> 01:11:34,667
Get into position.

861
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:36,835
1

862
01:11:37,002 --> 01:11:38,045
2 ...

863
01:11:41,966 --> 01:11:44,510
- Do I have something in my mouth?
- No !

864
01:11:44,969 --> 01:11:47,304
I put this bullet in my mouth.

865
01:11:56,939 --> 01:11:59,400
And now, l ... 2 ... and ...

866
01:12:04,613 --> 01:12:06,448
Here you go.

867
01:12:06,615 --> 01:12:09,410
- I deserve at least 500.
- I'll give you more next time.

868
01:12:11,912 --> 01:12:13,872
Professor, how much have you lost?

869
01:12:30,597 --> 01:12:32,474
Is it an hour to go home?

870
01:12:39,606 --> 01:12:40,566
You hear me?

871
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,902
Have you become dumb?

872
01:12:45,612 --> 01:12:46,572
Where were you?

873
01:12:46,739 --> 01:12:47,865
I was having fun!

874
01:12:48,032 --> 01:12:52,411
Are you there to work or have fun?

875
01:12:52,578 --> 01:12:54,913
It's my money, what's the problem?

876
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,248
Shut up !

877
01:12:56,415 --> 01:12:58,667
These other orphans are worthless.

878
01:12:58,834 --> 01:13:00,169
Do you dare to talk to your boss like that?

879
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:05,966
You won't go anywhere
during a contest!

880
01:13:06,675 --> 01:13:10,095
He takes himself for the king of Benares!
He wastes money!

881
01:13:10,262 --> 01:13:11,430
I'll tell Devi!

882
01:13:11,597 --> 01:13:13,766
Do as you like.

883
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,268
Start by sitting down!

884
01:13:16,685 --> 01:13:18,395
And don't move an inch.

885
01:13:19,063 --> 01:13:20,230
Sit down !

886
01:13:21,231 --> 01:13:22,441
What arrogance.

887
01:13:23,317 --> 01:13:25,903
You will give me your winnings from the contests.

888
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:44,880
For internships,
the subject of debate is ...

889
01:13:45,047 --> 01:13:46,423
Industrialization and its effects

890
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:48,509
on the environment,

891
01:13:49,009 --> 01:13:51,303
human life and society.

892
01:14:19,623 --> 01:14:20,749
Hey, Deepak.

893
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:23,919
Say something.

894
01:14:26,672 --> 01:14:30,092
You've been silent for too long.
Talk to us.

895
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,848
Leash.

896
01:14:36,014 --> 01:14:37,641
Take your time.

897
01:14:41,687 --> 01:14:43,564
"I love poetry."

898
01:14:51,613 --> 01:14:54,408
"You are like the train
at the misty dawn. "

899
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:59,580
"I shook like a shaken bridge."

900
01:15:23,312 --> 01:15:26,106
"I will not hesitate
<i> to </i> run away with you. "

901
01:15:45,417 --> 01:15:48,170
This pain will never end?

902
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,683
Deepak, get up!

903
01:16:04,019 --> 01:16:06,480
Hold my motorcycle keys, go where you want.

904
01:16:08,106 --> 01:16:09,608
Shaalu!

905
01:16:31,421 --> 01:16:33,757
The translation was for today.

906
01:16:34,258 --> 01:16:36,510
Printers are twiddling their thumbs.

907
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:38,178
Mr. Pathak?

908
01:16:38,971 --> 01:16:40,514
Everything is fine?

909
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,810
You will have it in three days.

910
01:16:44,977 --> 01:16:46,228
Three days?

911
01:16:46,395 --> 01:16:48,855
Devi isn't doing well these days.

912
01:16:51,608 --> 01:16:53,402
Mr. Verma ...

913
01:16:54,236 --> 01:16:56,071
an advance would be possible?

914
01:16:56,238 --> 01:16:58,615
You make me hang around.

915
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:04,204
But I can't refuse.

916
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:06,081
Hold.

917
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:10,794
Good.

918
01:17:20,637 --> 01:17:21,555
Excuse me.

919
01:17:21,722 --> 01:17:23,140
I was delayed.

920
01:17:32,691 --> 01:17:34,026
How many are there?

921
01:17:36,695 --> 01:17:38,530
30,000 rupees this time.

922
01:17:44,244 --> 01:17:45,495
Come with me.

923
01:17:52,711 --> 01:17:54,546
Do you see this portal?

924
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:56,131
Yes.

925
01:17:56,882 --> 01:17:58,508
Opposite, there is <i> there </i> a warehouse.

926
01:17:59,301 --> 01:18:00,886
The junkyard Pappu.

927
01:18:01,053 --> 01:18:03,597
Sell ​​that old machine
for 10 or 20,000.

928
01:18:04,723 --> 01:18:06,725
We are really trying.

929
01:18:06,892 --> 01:18:09,895
I think I will be able to pay soon.

930
01:18:10,062 --> 01:18:11,730
It's a joke?

931
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:16,902
It is not enough.

932
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:20,322
I have to tell you how?

933
01:18:20,739 --> 01:18:23,533
I'll pay the rest this week.

934
01:18:24,076 --> 01:18:25,702
Take this in the meantime.

935
01:18:33,585 --> 01:18:37,005
The rest this week.
And all of it next month.

936
01:19:19,214 --> 01:19:22,801
- So, you sold us your bonus to Lulu?
- No way!

937
01:19:22,968 --> 01:19:25,470
Sikandar sold it for 300,000.

938
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:28,181
How would Sikandar sell it
without my consent?

939
01:19:28,348 --> 01:19:29,766
He's not at Mr. Kallu's.

940
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:31,768
Where the fuck is past Sikandar?

941
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:15,479
Luxa police station

942
01:20:15,687 --> 01:20:17,981
The cops don't know where he is.

943
01:20:19,816 --> 01:20:21,067
You found it?

944
01:20:22,611 --> 01:20:24,321
What a bastard!

945
01:20:24,863 --> 01:20:26,364
Fucking thief!

946
01:20:26,531 --> 01:20:28,325
You motherfucker!

947
01:20:33,914 --> 01:20:36,958
What constitution forbids me
to buy your bonus?

948
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:38,710
Bring that damn constitution!

949
01:20:38,877 --> 01:20:41,379
Why talk about the constitution?

950
01:20:41,546 --> 01:20:44,758
It's a private matter.
Find an amicable agreement.

951
01:20:44,925 --> 01:20:47,219
Amicably ? I'll kill that bastard!

952
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:50,430
Pay 300,000 and I'll give it back to you
your bonus right.

953
01:20:50,597 --> 01:20:52,933
Not a single rupee, you bastard!

954
01:20:53,683 --> 01:20:56,394
Perhaps,
he did not pay Sikandar!

955
01:20:56,561 --> 01:20:58,647
Go get Sikandar.

956
01:20:58,813 --> 01:21:01,816
Ask him if I haven't paid for everything.

957
01:21:04,194 --> 01:21:05,946
Where will I find 300,000?

958
01:21:06,112 --> 01:21:07,322
I am nothing!

959
01:21:08,281 --> 01:21:11,284
Mr. Dubey, you are a witness.

960
01:21:11,451 --> 01:21:14,871
If he pays me 300,000,
I give him back his bonus right.

961
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:19,042
And thank you for insulting me.

962
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:20,502
Goodbye.

963
01:21:35,141 --> 01:21:38,311
From all Benares,
you won't get a better deal.

964
01:21:52,742 --> 01:21:53,910
You pay?

965
01:21:58,039 --> 01:22:00,166
Sir, if you could speed up.

966
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:02,794
- Where are you going?
- Howrah.

967
01:22:02,961 --> 01:22:04,045
With your goddess name,

968
01:22:04,212 --> 01:22:06,840
you should have four arms
on each side.

969
01:22:07,007 --> 01:22:09,175
Eight tickets in record time!

970
01:22:12,095 --> 01:22:14,347
Sir, if you could speed up ...

971
01:22:14,514 --> 01:22:16,308
What's in the rush?

972
01:22:20,103 --> 01:22:21,896
My father says:

973
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:23,898
"Who doesn't taste kheer,

974
01:22:24,065 --> 01:22:27,193
"ignore the joys of existence!"

975
01:22:29,613 --> 01:22:31,031
Here, take some.

976
01:22:31,823 --> 01:22:32,782
No, this is for you.

977
01:22:32,949 --> 01:22:34,326
Obviously.

978
01:22:34,993 --> 01:22:38,371
My father did it himself.
It is his birthday.

979
01:22:40,081 --> 01:22:41,166
Okay.

980
01:22:48,757 --> 01:22:50,425
- Delicious, isn't it?
- Very good.

981
01:22:58,683 --> 01:23:00,018
You live alone ?

982
01:23:00,185 --> 01:23:01,061
No,

983
01:23:01,227 --> 01:23:02,896
i live with my father.

984
01:23:03,063 --> 01:23:04,689
Father lives alone.

985
01:23:07,442 --> 01:23:09,736
I mean, he's alone during the day.

986
01:23:16,409 --> 01:23:17,619
From kheer?

987
01:23:19,537 --> 01:23:22,374
I haven't done one for a long time,
I thought...

988
01:23:24,292 --> 01:23:27,504
I have just finished dinner.
Keep it, I'll take it tomorrow.

989
01:23:31,216 --> 01:23:32,467
Eat.

990
01:23:34,427 --> 01:23:36,554
One of your favorite desserts.

991
01:23:43,853 --> 01:23:45,146
Its good.

992
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:48,400
Is there any milk left for tomorrow morning?

993
01:23:50,568 --> 01:23:51,778
What is that?

994
01:23:51,945 --> 01:23:54,239
I have finished my first month of work.

995
01:23:54,406 --> 01:23:55,990
My salary check.

996
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,451
How many?

997
01:23:58,618 --> 01:24:00,078
20,000.

998
01:24:01.663 --> 01:24:02.831
Good.

999
01:24:04,874 --> 01:24:06,668
Sit down next to me.

1000
01:24:11,464 --> 01:24:14,008
You didn't tell me anything
of your permanent job.

1001
01:24:15,176 --> 01:24:16,845
It is only temporary.

1002
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:20,849
I work to win
the ransom money.

1003
01:24:21,015 --> 01:24:22,934
- And after that...
- Then?

1004
01:24:29,983 --> 01:24:33,820
I want to go to study
at Allahabad University.

1005
01:24:34,904 --> 01:24:37,991
I will work part time
near college.

1006
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:40,410
Do you want to get out of here?

1007
01:24:48,918 --> 01:24:50,086
Yes.

1008
01:24:51,755 --> 01:24:53,089
Why?

1009
01:24:54,799 --> 01:24:57,677
Without this case, I would already have ...

1010
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:04,559
I'm probably better off alone.

1011
01:25:05,477 --> 01:25:08,438
It's not far.
I will come from time to time.

1012
01:25:08,605 --> 01:25:10,273
And your father?

1013
01:25:17,447 --> 01:25:19,741
So I don't count anymore?

1014
01:25:24,412 --> 01:25:26,915
If you've got everything ready, then ...

1015
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:29,793
Go.

1016
01:25:33,213 --> 01:25:35,840
I didn't kill you mother.

1017
01:25:40,678 --> 01:25:43,681
I will go to sleep in the ghats,
silently.

1018
01:25:46,434 --> 01:25:48,144
Father, please.

1019
01:25:52,857 --> 01:25:54.818
Please don't cry.

1020
01:28:47,281 --> 01:28:49,742
Write your address.

1021
01:28:58,876 --> 01:29:01,546
There are still narrow ways
in the mountains.

1022
01:29:02,046 --> 01:29:06,092
Wide track technology
will replace them in the future.

1023
01:29:06,634 --> 01:29:09,220
- You were major of your promotion?
- Yes sir.

1024
01:29:09,595 --> 01:29:12,265
We commit you to the 6-month trial,
in Allahabad.

1025
01:29:13,057 --> 01:29:15,476
- Thank you sir.
- Well done, congratulations.

1026
01:29:46,215 --> 01:29:48,760
<i> Today is the big day! </i>

1027
01:29:49,218 --> 01:29:51,763
Dedicate this day to the Almighty!

1028
01:29:52,388 --> 01:29:54,432
Long live our god Shiva ...

1029
01:29:54,807 --> 01:29:57,351
So everything is fine?

1030
01:29:57,518 --> 01:29:59,687
- Take my bet.
- How many ?

1031
01:30:00,521 --> 01:30:01,856
- 10,000.
- Noted.

1032
01:30:02,023 --> 01:30:04,484
- Do you want to win?
- Of course !

1033
01:30:10,782 --> 01:30:12,950
Let's see who will be the winner!

1034
01:30:13,117 --> 01:30:14,410
Jhonta, dive in there.

1035
01:30:18,289 --> 01:30:19,582
Quickly ! Faster !

1036
01:30:21,209 --> 01:30:22,043
Go further.

1037
01:30:31,677 --> 01:30:32,804
Jhonta!

1038
01:30:37,934 --> 01:30:39,102
Jhonta!

1039
01:30:40,478 --> 01:30:42,396
Munna, see you there!

1040
01:30:47,735 --> 01:30:49,779
Vikram, find Jhonta!

1041
01:30:56,577 --> 01:30:59,872
Stand aside all of you!
Make room!

1042
01:31:00,039 --> 01:31:02,083
Let it pass!

1043
01:31:03,751 --> 01:31:04,961
Jhonta!

1044
01:31:05,128 --> 01:31:07,922
I won't make you compete anymore,
my little.

1045
01:31:27,817 --> 01:31:30,862
- What?
- Did I make you lose everything?

1046
01:31:32,989 --> 01:31:34,031
No.

1047
01:32:00,057 --> 01:32:01,893
Want a magic trick?

1048
01:32:04,187 --> 01:32:05,855
Something in my hand?

1049
01:32:08,191 --> 01:32:10,651
Something in my other hand?

1050
01:32:11,194 --> 01:32:12,153
No.

1051
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,322
Something in my mouth?

1052
01:32:16,532 --> 01:32:17,575
No.

1053
01:32:18,784 --> 01:32:20,328
1, 2, 3 ...

1054
01:32:28,586 --> 01:32:29,670
Who's is this?

1055
01:32:30,004 --> 01:32:31,297
It's for you.

1056
01:32:32,298 --> 01:32:33,507
Where is she from?

1057
01:32:33,674 --> 01:32:36,219
I found it while diving.

1058
01:32:54,737 --> 01:32:56,072
Yes, that's fine with me.

1059
01:33:01,327 --> 01:33:02,453
Thank you.

1060
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:42,618
Here, it's hot.

1061
01:33:43,703 --> 01:33:45,871
I prepared this for you,
eat it on the train.

1062
01:33:46,038 --> 01:33:47,623
Eat, I'll finish.

1063
01:33:57,216 --> 01:33:58,175
Its good.

1064
01:34:09,812 --> 01:34:11,063
Let's go?

1065
01:34:22,283 --> 01:34:25,411
Call me when you arrive.

1066
01:34:26,329 --> 01:34:29,623
- Okay, I pure.
- Go ahead.

1067
01:34:31,459 --> 01:34:33,377
Don't stay near the door.

1068
01:34:36,797 --> 01:34:39,175
- Make yourself comfortable.
- See you soon, dad.

1069
01:34:39,342 --> 01:34:42,094
Don't worry, I'll take care of him.

1070
01:35:35,231 --> 01:35:36,357
Hello.

1071
01:35:37,358 --> 01:35:39,985
I am coming to see Mr. Ramdhari Agarwal.

1072
01:35:40,611 --> 01:35:42,738
I am Devi Pathak.

1073
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:46,409
Piyush was my friend.

1074
01:35:46,575 --> 01:35:49,328
Let's go home to talk.

1075
01:36:02,466 --> 01:36:05,719
- What are you doing ? Have you gone mad?
- Why come now?

1076
01:36:05,886 --> 01:36:07,555
Are you alright, my daughter?

1077
01:36:08,389 --> 01:36:09,473
Why?

1078
01:36:10,099 --> 01:36:12,101
What harm had he done to you?

1079
01:38:01,794 --> 01:38:03,254
Here is water.

1080
01:38:43,544 --> 01:38:46,714
30 rupees to go to Sangam!

1081
01:38:50,259 --> 01:38:51,719
Go up, ma'am.

1082
01:38:52,177 --> 01:38:53,679
And you sir?

1083
01:38:53,846 --> 01:38:55,598
I'll take you to Sangam.

1084
01:39:14,450 --> 01:39:15,659
Come.

1085
01:39:49,777 --> 01:39:52,112
You come <i> to </i> Sangam
for the first time ?

1086
01:39:52,279 --> 01:39:53,447
Yes.

1087
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:55,949
And you?

1088
01:39:56,575 --> 01:39:57,868
The second time.

1089
01:40:01,789 --> 01:40:04,291
They say you have to come <i> to </i> Sangam
twice.

1090
01:40:04,458 --> 01:40:05,459
Why?

1091
01:40:05,626 --> 01:40:08,837
A first time alone,
and a second time with someone.
