1
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,370
Who is it?

2
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,580
Overtake him.

3
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,290
I've been honking for so long.

4
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,870
But he doesn't seem to comply.

5
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,330
Honk again.

6
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,750
Oh, so it's you.

7
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,630
I had no clue that you were on the bike.

8
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,050
Otherwise, I wouldn't have asked my driver to honk.

9
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,710
I would've told him to run you down.

10
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,130
An army of mice can't hunt down a lion.

11
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,250
Do I have to request all of you?

12
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,380
Go on.

13
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,000
Are you going to kill me now?

14
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,550
Rudra Pratap Chauhan.

15
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,550
Encounter Specialist.

16
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,800
You arrested me two.

17
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,250
But nothing happened.

18
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,840
I got bail in a jiffy.

19
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,840
One more thing.

20
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,920
I don't think you have a chance this time either.

21
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,420
Look there, here comes the cavalry.

22
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,800
One bullet, one enemy.

23
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,130
2 meters distance, and a few inches of grave!

24
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,300
File closed!

25
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,130
Hello sir.

26
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,710
Hello sir.

27
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,090
Sir. Sir.

28
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,300
Sir...you caused an earthquake on arrival.

29
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,050
Even I want to score half century, sir.

30
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,300
I mean, why didn't you take me along as well, sir?

31
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,500
Even I could've caused some fireworks.

32
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,090
And killed those brothers-in-law.

33
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,050
Brothers-in-law?

34
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,000
!

35
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,920
Fine, be ready to celebrate on next Diwali.

36
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,590
And for sweets as well.

37
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,630
Sweets?

38
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,710
Meaning, your SP madam will call me in now.

39
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,340
For some sweets.

40
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:43,960
May I come in?

41
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,250
Officer, there are other methods to do your job other than shooting someone.

42
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
A Policeman must display responsible behaviour.

43
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,550
And especially you, because the entire state have their eyes on you.

44
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,920
And, why did you have to shoot Pandari?

45
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,000
Can you tell me why?

46
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,210
One doesn't need permission to kill rats.

47
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:21,800
Get out!

48
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:24,880
Out!

49
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,670
I am sorry.

50
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,550
I am sorry...

51
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,840
Rudra, I am the boss in the office.

52
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,880
But you're the boss at home.

53
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,250
Sorry!

54
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,090
I know I was a little rude back there.

55
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,420
But you know, Rudra, that I was only speaking for your good.

56
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,800
Killing people is not the only solution.

57
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,250
Huh...

58
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,050
People like them only understand the language of violence.

59
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:15,380
But I feel...my Rudra is lost somewhere in all this commotion.

60
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,880
Madam...

61
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,050
Madam...

62
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,380
Search the room.

63
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,920
Don't miss a single object.

64
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,170
Yes, ma'am.

65
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,090
- Question the staff as well. - Yes, ma'am.

66
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,710
I was on duty here all night, sir.

67
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,920
I just left for a while to have my dinner.

68
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,420
In fact, the warden herself told me to go have my dinner.

69
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,420
- That's all I know, sir. - Okay.

70
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,800
- Send the bodies for post-mortem. - Okay, ma'am.

71
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,210
When did you last talk to your daughter?

72
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,960
Our daughter called us last evening.

73
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,380
She sounded very happy.

74
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,420
I don't think my daughter can ever do such a thing.

75
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,300
She can never commit suicide.

76
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,340
But the evidence that we found suggests that they committed suicide.

77
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,090
The question is why?

78
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,550
Madam, our daughter can never commit suicide.

79
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,050
Never.

80
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,590
Look, you can go for now.

81
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:57,550
Yes, madam.

82
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:02,170
But the Police can call you for investigations at any time.

83
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,170
- Honey. - No madam, sugar.

84
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,550
- Honey Singh. - Yes, madam.

85
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,250
- Take their statements, please. - Yes, madam.

86
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,090
Come, follow me.

87
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:11,800
Yes.

88
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,130
As the Education Minister of this Statement...

89
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,250
...what is your opinion about the incident that occurred in the college?

90
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,210
Look, I've given an ultimatum to the Chief Minister...

91
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,800
...and, he's assured me that the investigation

92
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,960
...under the supervision of SP Aditi Singh

93
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,210
will be fast-tracked.

94
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:35,090
A government that cannot assure the security of women in their own college...

95
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,750
...has no right to stay in power.

96
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,130
No, right at all.

97
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:45,460
But I request the media to stop making a hype of this case.

98
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,960
And I want the Chief Minister to resign from his post with immediate effect.

99
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,130
I've to attend a meeting.

100
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,670
Only after the party meeting, place.

101
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,920
And, I say this out loud.

102
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,300
A woman's honour, is the country's honour.

103
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,670
And this incident demands an unbiased investigation.

104
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,250
Immediately.

105
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,210
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!

106
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,340
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!

107
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,920
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!

108
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,550
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!

109
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,840
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!

110
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,460
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!

111
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,670
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!

112
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,800
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!

113
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,670
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!

114
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,550
Madam, reports.

115
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,840
Madam, we found four dead bodies in the room.

116
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,300
But there were 5 blood samples in the room.

117
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,630
And the 5th blood sample didn't belong to the warden.

118
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,340
What?

119
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,300
Are you positive that the 5th blood sample doesn't belong to the warden?

120
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,710
Positive?

121
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,750
Madam, believe me.

122
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,420
Honey Singh giving scientific answer.

123
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,550
Smallmouth big talking.

124
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,550
This suicide mystery is as complicated as Jalebi?

125
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:07,710
Jalebi?

126
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,380
Twisted and tasty.

127
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,750
Morning, sir.

128
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,250
Morning, sir.

129
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,130
Sit.

130
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:46,800
Now speak.

131
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,750
What is your opinion about the incident at the Women's college

132
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,630
and the poor administrative condition of the city?

133
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,420
The Women's College is an respective organisation of our state.

134
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,960
The entire state is proud of this organisation.

135
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,460
I strongly condemn the incident that occurred there.

136
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,210
We'll investigate to find out the reason behind why those three girls committed suicide?

137
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,250
I have faith in the Law and Order.

138
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:29,960
That's why I've been receiving the love of my people.

139
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,460
But what about those dozens of incidents that have been occurring in this state.

140
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,380
Kidnapping. Murder. Rape. Businessmen fleeing.

141
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,420
Will the people be able to maintain their faith in you in such condition?

142
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,130
Hey...

143
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,460
Enough!

144
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,670
You've said enough.

145
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,960
Don't try to show that only the media cares for the people, and we don't.

146
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,840
Don't try to conspire.

147
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,710
I am a Minister for the poor and the underprivileged and the exploited.

148
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,920
If people like you were the only well-wishers of the people...

149
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
...then I wouldn't be winning the elections three times.

150
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,800
Although you're talking nonsense.

151
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,550
But you tell me what I should do.

152
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,710
I'll do that for your sake.

153
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,250
Sir, daring Police officer Rudra Pratap Singh Chauhan.

154
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,420
The public's demand is to reinstate him in the State Crime Branch Headquarters.

155
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,170
Done.

156
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,210
I respect daring Police officers.

157
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,960
But...troubling innocent people in the name of honesty...

158
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,250
...pressing false charges against them,

159
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:12,420
deeming people as criminal on the basis of their caste.

160
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,420
And working only for medals and applause is completely wrong.

161
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't want any Police officer to trouble the people of my state.

162
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,170
That's it.

163
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,090
- PA... - Sir.

164
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:37,630
Tell DGP sir to reinstate Rudra Pratap Singh back to Crime Branch with immediate effect.

165
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,500
- Order. - Yes, sir.

166
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,500
Okay.

167
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,550
Bless all of you.

168
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,050
Bless all of you.

169
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,050
Aditi.

170
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,170
That suicide case?

171
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,460
It's not a suicide.

172
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,250
How can you see that?

173
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,380
Because the prime evidences of suicide say otherwise.

174
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,880
Four dead bodies and five blood samples.

175
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,670
It has to be a case of cold-blooded murder.

176
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,710
Rudra.

177
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,340
I think I need your help.

178
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,960
But you know what my methods are.

179
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,920
You will never change.

180
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:00,380
Look Rudra, you must change your methods slightly.

181
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,550
For me.

182
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,130
Because I don't want you to get transferred again.

183
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,420
I mean first Bangalore, then Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, and now here.

184
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,420
Please.

185
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,250
For me.

186
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,880
For you...I will try.

187
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,340
No.

188
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,210
This is not their handwriting at all.

189
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,460
I want to see all the objects which the Police recovered from this room.

190
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,380
Sir.

191
00:22:59,460 --> 00:22:59,920
Dubey.

192
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,750
Get the bag.

193
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,670
Here they are, sir.

194
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,300
I want all the details of this sim card.

195
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,750
Call log. Last call.

00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,500
Okay.

197
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,590
And go to the back and find out...

198
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:06,250
...in whose name is this 500,000 rupees payslip.

199
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,000
There has to be a cash trail to this.

200
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,920
I want details of all the girls that stay in the college hostel.

201
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,300

202
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,880

205
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:30,590

Sir, the call's connected.

208
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,880
Good afternoon, sir.

209
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,550
The issue...is a little serious.

210
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,840
So I called personally.

211
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,210
The female suicide case which you are investigation...

212
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,380
...you must reach some conclusion quickly.

213
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,590
Sir, the Police are doing their job.

214
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,710
I assure you that the Police will soon reach some conclusion.

215
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:04,250
It's what i expect from Police officers like you.

216
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,000
Yes.

217
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:10,670
But please remember that the Opposition don't make an issue out of it.

218
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,550
Yes, sir.

219
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,300
Better explain to your Department's Superman.

220
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,920
Don't be too trigger happy.

221
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:25,550
And do his job within the limits of the Law.

222
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,380
Sir.

223
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,630
Start counting.

224
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,630
101...

225
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,210
102...

226
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,460
103...

227
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,880
- Manager? - Yes, ma'am.

228
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,300
Okay, SP Aditi Sing.

229
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,590

234
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,880
Sir, whose account is this?

You ask him, sir.

245

He's the senior, although he doesn't look like it,

246
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,170
but...

247
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,130

00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:54,670
Thank you.

262
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,960
Always embarrassing me...

263
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,670
Take a left.

264
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,420
Hello.

265
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,550
Rudra, I've got two important numbers.

266
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,380
Note them down.

267
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,130
This is it, sir.

268
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,550
12/272.

269
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,460
Watch me.

270
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,250
Is Ramesh Dubey at home.

271
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,920
There is no Ramesh Dubey here.

272
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,960
He doesn't.

273
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,960
He doesn't live here.

274
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,880
But sir, the bank gave this address.

275
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,670
12/272.

276
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,420
Ask her.

277
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,380
I am asking her.

278
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,380
- How long have you been living here? - 10 years, sir.

279
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,380
I see...

280
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:40,960
Dulare, wait.

281
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,090
Fake identity, fake address, fake everything, sir.

282
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,880
You know what, go back to the bank.

283
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,170
Again bank, sir.

284
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,750
Is there a problem, Honey Singh?

285
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,170
No, sir.

286
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:55,800
Good.

287
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:57,920
Go back.

288
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,250
Yes, sir. Going, sir.

289
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,750
Back to the bank.

290
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,170
- Details are not up-to-date, sir. - Doesn't matter.

291
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,750
When was the last transaction made?

292
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,840
On Wednesday 6 pm.

293
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,380
Money was withdrawn from the Sunder Nagar ATM, sir.

294
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:24,210
Wednesday evening... 6...

295
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,500
- On the day of the murder. - Yes, sir.

296
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,500
Anyway...I want to check the CCTV footage.

297
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,460
Sorry sir, actually...

298
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,210
I said i want to check the CCTV footage.

299
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,000
Now.

300
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,380
Sir.

301
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,960
- Is this the footage? - Yes, sir.

302
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,710
Slow it down.

303
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,840
- Is this at 6:30? - Yes, sir.

304
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,380
Pause it.

305
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,550
I want a picture of this man.

306
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,630
Sir, that looks like Contractor Pandey.

307
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,090
Yes, looks like him.

308
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,590
Do you know him?

309
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,300
Yes, of course.

310
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,670
He's a big sycophant of the Ministers.

311
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,710
- Shankar. - Greetings, brother-in-law.

312
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:36,090
- Where are you these days? - What's wrong?

313
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:41,000
Go and check why that Police officer took Pandey to the Police Station.

314
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:41,920
Yes.

315
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,170
Find out what's the issue.

316
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,170
- And call me back. - Okay.

317
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,500
Bring him here.

318
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,210
Great.

319
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,840
How did you get hold of the debit card of Ramesh Dubey?

320
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,300
Ramesh Dubey?

321
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,500
Ramesh Dubey who?

322
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,210
How is Ramesh Dubey connected to you...

323
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,050
...that you were withdrawing money from his debit card?

324
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,090
Money? Card?

325
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,460
What are you saying, madam?

326
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,710
I have only two cards.

327
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,550
Voter card. And Licence.

328
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,460
I can show it if you want.

329
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,840
And last month I even applied for an Aadhar Card (ID card) under the government scheme.

330
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,960
I can give you a photocopy of you wish.

331
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,840
Greetings, SP madam.

332
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,130
What are you sending, madam?

333
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,050
Babloo, Mantu, you guys startled me.

334
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,130
Brother got you bail.

335
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:50,800
Now, let's go.

336
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,710
Take a good look, madam.

337
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,420
Are all the signatures in place?

338
00:30:59,090 --> 00:30:59,960
Come on, let's go, Mr. Pandey.

339
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:00,840
I'll take your leave.

340
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,380
So Mr. Pandey. I heard that the Police took you in.

341
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:25,630
Shankar, that new SP doesn't know how well connected I am.

342
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,750
And still, you got arrested.

343
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,210
You're the main party worker.

344
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:34,090
And, there is no one above you.

345
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,500
What's going on, Aditi?

346
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,960
What kind of investigation are you getting involved?

347
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,670
The girl's hostel...

348
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:05,840
Look, don't do anything to spoil the Police Department's image.

349
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,630
No, sir...

350
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,500
And, a suicide case has to be closed, that's all.

351
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,300
So why this running around?

352
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,590
But, sir...

353
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,750
Look, as a Lady SP...

354
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,920
...the Home Minister has done you a big favor.

355
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,750
Please don't do anything to get stripped of this.

356
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,710
It's an open and shut suicide case.

357
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,170
The report should be on my table immediately.

358
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,500
You'll get your chance to play Sherlock Holmes.

359
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,170
There are many pending cases.

360
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,050
Now go.

361
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:46,050
I wonder which department I am working for?

362
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,380
And why?

363
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,750
A case which is definitely a murder case...

364
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,170
...we barely manage to find one suspect,

365
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,000
but the court grants him bail.

366
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,630
They should've told us during the training...

367
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,550
...that the Police are like the three monkeys of Gandhiji.

368
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,630
See no evil, Hear no Evil, Say no Evil to the Criminals.

369
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:13,170
Aditi...that's the culture and system of this Department.

370
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:18,250
We've to stay within this system and fight against it.

371
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:23,000
And one doesn't need any special training for it.

372
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,840
Our department teaches us everything.

373
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:26,920
Fight for what?

374
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,340
DGP sir told me personally...

375
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,630
"Aditi, this is an open and shut case of suicide."

376
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,670
"Make your report."

377
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,800
Just do one thing for now.

378
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,630
Send a Suicide report file to the DGP's office.

379
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,210
I will have to.

380
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,710
You know what, it's over.

381
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,960
It's not over.

382
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,300
Its just begun.

383
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,460
'Yeah Rudra, I've to important numbers.

384
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,460
Write them down.'

385
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,590
The number you gave me belonged to some girl.

386
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,460
She's a patient in Arogya Dham Hospital.

387
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,460
'I found this girl in an unconscious state.'

388
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,130
'She had a severe injury on her head.'

389
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,090
'And, I found this mobile in her pocket.'

390
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,800
- 'No one knows about her yet.' - Good.

391
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,460
I don't know why, Aditi, but I feel this is our last option.

392
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,500
Only I know about her, and now you do.

393
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,000
I want this to stay between us.

394
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:35,750
And if possible, post some of your trusted people outside the hospital.

395
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,960
As security.

396
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,340
That will be good.

397
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,960
Your tea's gone cold.

398
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,300
As I said before.

399
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,670
The Administration will order an unbiased investigation of this case.

400
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,460
And that's what we did.

401
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,840
After a careful investigation...

402
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,670
...the report submitted to the Home Minister by the Department...

403
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,340
...it was a suicide.

404
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,920
The Opposition made a hype of this issue...

405
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,250
...and tried to spoil my image.

406
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,420
And I strongly condemn their action.

407
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,670
Give me the tobacco.

408
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:35,090
As the Chief Minister of the state...

409
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,880
...the law and Order of this city is my responsibility.

410
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:48,090
That's why I gave a handsfree to a talented officer like Rudra Pratap Singh.

411
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,460
Sir, that's free hand and not hands-free.

412
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,960
It's the same thing, hands-free and free hand.

413
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,000
But I won't take credit for it.

414
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,340
Rudra Pratap deserves all the accolades.

415
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,130
Rudra Pratap deserves the commendations.

416
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,130
Blessings to all of you.

417
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,250
- I'll come home in the evening... - Sir.

418
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:24,630
Hello.

419
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,710
Hello, Rudra sir.

420
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,050
This is Bramhanand Tripathi.

421
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:28,460
Hello.

422
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,750
Myself SI Dulare.

423
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,630
- SI Dulare? - Yes...

424
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,460
Isn't this Mr. Rudra's number?

425
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,340
Yes...

426
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,210
Then how did you answer his phone?

427
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,460
How can you keep someone else' phone?

428
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,550
Who gave it to you?

429
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,380
Who gave you this right?

430
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,800
- Let me talk to... - Just a minute...

431
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,710
Sir, its opposition leader Mr. Tripathi on the line.

432
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,800
I will call you back.

433
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,250
Yes.

434
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,300
Say what?

435
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,340
Why do you give your phone to someone else?

436
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:07,500
Look Rudra sir, in order to maintain peace and order in the city...

437
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,590
Pro... Prom... Porm...

438
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,500
What is it called?

439
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,250
Sir. - Promptness.

440
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:18,500
Yes, the promptness you've displayed...is truly commendable.

441
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,130
And that's why I called.

442
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,590
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

443
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,750
I am congratulating you, and you're sounding so upset.

444
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,630
Look, Rudra sir.

445
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,050
I, Brahmanand Tripathi, and my Vikas party...

446
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,630
...are with you all the way.

447
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:38,250
Whether you take any action or proceedings, we are with you.

448
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:50,460
"The rascal stole...all my emotions."

449
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:55,880
"I climbed another ladder..."

450
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:00,840
"...such was my amazing promotion."

451
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,420
"O ascetic..."

452
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,750
"O ascetic..."

453
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,380
"My beloved..."

454
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,000
"...swayed my waist..."

455
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:14,670
"As I stole his heart with my eyes."

456
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,710
"O ascetic..."

457
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:20,960
"O ascetic..."

458
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,710
"My beloved..."

459
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,590
"...swayed my waist..."

460
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,670
"As I stole his heart with my eyes."

461
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,880
"I am like a double-edged sword."

462
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,670
"I am a little sweet and a little salty."

463
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,800
"But I made a mistake befriending my beloved."

464
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,130
"The sassy lass robbed everything from me."

465
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:43,800
"The sassy lass robbed everything from me."

466
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,500
"The sassy lass robbed everything from me."

467
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:52,170
"The sassy lass robbed everything from me."

468
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,670
"The rascal treated me to cappuccino and stole my heart."

469
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,590
"Stole my heart."

470
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,130
"He stole my heart."

471
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,590
"Stole my heart."

472
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,050
"O ascetic..."

473
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,090
"I've been robbed."

474
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,590
"O ascetic..."

475
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,130
"Holi..."

476
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,880
"Babaji had three pigeons, and they all liked to fly."

477
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,460
"Nice..."

478
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,420
"Babaji had three pigeons, and they all liked to fly."

479
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,880
"One flutters his wing and the other winks at the girls."

480
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,960
"Great...really great." "This is really great."

481
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,000
"Hookah's piping hot while the pipe's tastes nice too."

482
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:41,750
"Look at him."

483
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,170
"Hookah's piping hot while the pipe's tastes nice too."

484
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,420
"Sister-in-law's fallen down..."

485
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,420
"...pick her up and take a kiss."

486
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,000
"The rascal treated me to cappuccino and stole my heart."

487
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:01,250
"The sassy lass robbed everything from me."

488
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:05,800
"The sassy lass robbed everything from me."

489
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:10,880
"The rascal took me to see an English film and stole my heart."

490
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,880
"Stole my heart."

491
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,550
"The sassy lass robbed everything from me."

492
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:26,340
"Stole my heart."

493
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,960
ACP madam.

494
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:33,050
You said that the investigation will be unbiased.

495
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,630
Our daughters can never commit suicide.

496
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,670
Look, our investigation isn't over yet.

497
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,130
And just like you, even we believe that your daughters didn't commit suicide.

498
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,800
They have been murdered.

499
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,630
We'll soon find a suspect.

500
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:56,920
And believe me, whoever is behind this incident will be someone well connected.

501
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,960
But at that time, you shouldn't go back on your words.

502
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,130
Only then can we get justice for your children.

503
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,550
You have our full support.

504
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,340
Thank you.

505
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,670
Thank you.

506
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,630
This time my I've maintained Law and Order during my course.

507
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,710
And you guys have done your part too.

508
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,590
We will get the votes.

509
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:27,380
You must all strengthen the party.

510
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,800
And keep promoting Fodder Machine.

511
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,250
There is no dearth of funds.

512
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,630
Everyone will make a buck.

513
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,920
Your pockets will be jingling.

514
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,170
Don't worry.

515
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,960
I am in a hurry now.

516
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,420
I have a rally meeting to attend to.

517
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,050
We'll meet tomorrow at the same time.

518
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,840
Blessings to all of you.

519
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,340
Bring me the files I need to sign.

520
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,670
Sir, please read them once.

521
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,210
Why?

522
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:59,130
Why didn't you read them?

523
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:04,670
Was your IAS degree from Dhanbad fake?

524
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:05,840
Huh?

525
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,710
Should I order a CBI inquiry?

526
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,840
Asking me to read?

527
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,630
Fine, I'll call you later.

528
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,710
Greetings, sir.

529
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,000
What is it?

530
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,750
That College incident.

531
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,840
Rudra Pratap from Crime Branch has found that girl.

532
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,000
I see.

533
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,880
She's in Arogya Hospital.

534
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,630
And the news is that Tripathi from the Opposition is fully supporting him.

535
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:41,710
Hello.

536
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:45,710
Sir, the girl's blood matched with the blood sample that you provided.

537
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,130
- I am coming. - Thank you.

538
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,550
Sir.

539
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:10,250
- All okay. - Sir, all okay here.

540
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:13,550
But that man standing there has been pacing around the place since morning.

541
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,340
Who sent you?

542
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,800
Shankar sir.

543
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,130
Shankar.

544
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,710
Where can I find this Shankar?

545
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,210
Tell me.

546
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,630
Teli Gali, 25.

547
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,460
Check her first.

548
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,550
His name is Shankar.

549
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,250
He's the CM's sycophant.

550
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,750
I am sure he's involved in this case.

551
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,420
And I think he's the one who got Pandey bail.

552
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,340
And Pandey's been missing since that day.

553
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:08,630
But there's nothing we can do without strong evidence.

554
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:12,800
Aditi, it's like playing hide-n-seek with the crime.

555
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:17,170
The more you enjoy it, the more you'll play.

556
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:27,130
But in this game, someone will give up first.

557
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:32,000
Welcome. Welcome, DGP sir.

558
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:37,210
What is the condition of Law and Order?

559
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,590
All okay, sir.

560
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:46,800
- DGP sir. - Sir.

561
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,630
Tie it. what are you waiting for?

562
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,630
If I had fallen down, then so would the government.

563
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:05,500
And the media would've turned this into breaking news...

564
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:06,300
...that the government collapsed.

565
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,420
Do you know that?

566
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:09,590
You don't.

567
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,630
If you tie it, you'll get to keep your job.

568
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:29,380
Don't be shy.

569
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,800
Your SP's on the way too.

570
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,590
That's more like it.

571
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:46,960
Now shine it too.

572
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,420
Take your handkerchief out.

573
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,500
Come on.

574
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,590
Nice. Very nice.

575
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:02,050
Very good Mr. DGP.

576
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:06,420
Blessings!

577
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,500
Did you see the breaking news today?

578
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,750
No, sir.

579
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,590
The bitter truth of Democracy.

580
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:46,380
This is the Parliament House where this shameful incident occurred.

581
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:50,670
A DGP rank police officer is tying the CM's shoelace.

582
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:54,130
So what if the DGP tied my shoelace.

583
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:56,630
It's no ordinary shoelace.

584
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:02,170
And I don't want such an incident to happen to you.

585
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,300
I just wanted to investigate.

586
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:11,880
As long as you remain as Gandhiji's three monkeys, you will stay alive.

587
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:18,960
And the day you'll try to be a hero of your Department...

588
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,840
...someone will shoot you done.

589
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,250
I am explaining to you because you're just a kid.

590
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:30,960
See you, sir.

591
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,920
Aditi.

592
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,420
What happened?

593
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,050
Nothing.

594
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,840
Why are you so angry?

595
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,170
Let it be.

596
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:18,920
Dulare.

597
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,210
- Jai Hindi, sir. - Jai Hind.

598
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,050
I wanted to give you this file.

599
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,340
Sinha sir said it's urgent, so...

600
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:25,750
Okay.

601
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,050
Goodnight, sir.

602
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:33,920
Dulare brought some of your files.

603
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,210
Keep it, please.

604
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:45,250
What happened?

605
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,340
Are you going to say something?

606
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,130
The CM called me today.

607
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,420
I am coming from there.

608
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,210
What did the CM say?

609
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,250
What will he say?

610
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:01,340
Bloody corrupt man.

611
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:03,420
He was threatening me.

612
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:06,590
Threatening?

613
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:08,170
What kind of threat.

614
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:12,250
Rudra, he knows that we're still investigating this case.

615
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,340
He threatened to kill me.

616
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,670
- Hello. - Shankar has opened fire on us.

617
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:36,250
Send backup immediately.

618
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:39,300
There's been an attack on sir's house.

619
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:40,750
We must get there immediately.

620
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:09,630
Here you go, brother.

621
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:10,420
Throw it.

622
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,300
Careful!

623
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,000
Get lost! Get lost! Get lost!

624
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:57,380
Quiet.

625
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,090
You bark a lot.

626
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,090
But, that doesn't make you a lion.

627
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:12,130
What did you think?

628
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,710
You can barge in my home and kill me.

629
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:16,630
Huh...

630
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,630
I will fix the time of your death

631
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:36,590
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!

632
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:38,090
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!

633
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:39,000
Calm down.

634
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:40,590
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!

635
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:41,880
Calm down, everyone.

636
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:47,090
I have a question.

637
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:51,000
What is this terrible time we're living in?

638
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:59,500
It's so embarrassing that the CM makes a DGP tie his shoelace.

639
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:02,170
A Police officer is attacked.

640
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:03,960
What will happen to this state?

641
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:07,710
Police officers are murdered in broad daylight.

642
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:15,460
In fact, Prasadi Lal has no right to remain the CM of this state.

643
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:20,550
And I strongly oppose his rally.

644
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:22,710
Jai Hind. Jai Bharat.

645
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:23,670
Let's go.

646
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:25,210
- Mr. Tripathi! - Long live...

647
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,920
- Mr. Tripathi! - Long live...

648
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,590
- Mr. Tripathi! - Long live...

649
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:30,750
- Mr. Tripathi! - Long live...

650
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:58,000
Where are you going?

651
00:59:58,210 --> 00:59:59,090
The headquarters.

652
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:00,300
The CM's rally is today.

653
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:06,840
So now what?

654
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:10,300
Hanumant and Anjana's body has been sent for post-mortem.

655
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:13,960
It's okay.

656
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,840
Rudra. Everything will be fine.

657
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,130
Come, I'll drop you.

658
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,000
Come on.

659
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,500
Okay, see you in the evening.

660
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,210
- Aditi. - Yeah.

661
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:03,550
I could have...killed him today.

662
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,550
- Who? - Shankar.

663
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,670
- Rudra... - I visited CM house.

664
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:10,800
Are you mad..

665
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,210
But, I didn't do it.

666
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:16,500
Not because I can't kill him.

667
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:24,340
But I didn't kill him because that would've made you angry.

668
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:32,630
See you.

669
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,300
Hello.

670
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:49,420
Yes, Sapna.

671
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,130
Sir, the girl is conscious.

672
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:52,880
That's good.

673
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,340
Take care of her, I'll be there.

674
01:01:55,630 --> 01:01:56,170
Okay.

675
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,050
Aditi, that girl's conscious.

676
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:02,340
I must go.

677
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,210
Good.

678
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:05,840
Keep updating me about every development.

679
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:07,340
I will.

680
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:37,670
Look, don't be scared.

681
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:38,710
You're safe.

682
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:40,340
You're in my house.

683
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:42,420
My name is Rudra.

684
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:45,250
I am a Police officer.

685
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:51,000
Can you tell me..

686
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,880
what happened with you on that day?

687
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:37,340
The CM's rally will reach Shashtri Nagar through this route.

688
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:40,380
- Mr. Mishra, you will handle Shashtri Nagar area. - Yes, ma'am.

689
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,880
At this turn, the rally will reach Indra Nagar.

690
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:46,130
Mr. Upadhyay, you will handle the Indra Nagar area.

691
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,960
My name is Pooja.

692
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:59,710
And I am the girl's hostel warden Kanchan Devi's daughter.

693
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:01,300
Come.

694
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:04,630
Sit.

695
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,920
What happened on that day?

696
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:24,050
All this began on our College's Annual Day function.

697
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:32,670
Our Chief guest, respect Chief Minister...

698
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:39,050
...spared some of his valuable time to attend our College's 50th Annual Day function.

699
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:41,960
And for that, I am truly obliged.

700
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:47,750
And I request him to come here and bless the children.

701
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:57,050
Calm down.

702
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:02,800
I am really happy..

703
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:06,800
..to see all the children here.

704
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:14,460
The way woman are advancing in every sector.

705
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:18,920
My hats off to all the girls.

706
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:27,710
The Women's college Student leader Sanju.

707
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,920
Wow!

708
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:32,800
Amazing.

709
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:36,170
She is a very talented student.

710
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:49,170
I truly commend her aspirations and talent.

711
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:51,420
I appreciate it.

712
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,880
Did I scare you?

713
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:59,420
How can I be scared of you?

714
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:08,170
This is how you steal my heart.

715
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:10,090
Really? Really?

716
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:14,340
What?

717
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:17,590
First...can I say something?

718
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,750
Did you have to talk at this time?

719
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:25,960
Okay, forget it.

720
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:28,090
I won't say it.

721
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:40,670
Okay, ...say it.

722
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:47,340
You know, if you could get me an election ticket as well.

723
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,630
You just climbed up a single ladder...

724
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:56,130
...and already eyeing the minister's chair.

725
01:06:58,170 --> 01:06:59,300
No.

726
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,380
All I am asking for a ticket.

727
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:07,130
It is not a joke.

728
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:15,170
Look, whenever I ask you for a ticket, you make some excuse.

729
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:21,750
Whenever you call me, and wherever, I come immediately.

730
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:23,630
And never ask a question.

731
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:28,130
Please do this one thing for me.

732
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:36,170
Look...i even make promises to the people.

733
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,630
That's my habit.

734
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:42,840
You see, Shankar is my brother-in-law.

735
01:07:44,090 --> 01:07:45,550
He keeps asking me for a ticket, but I don't give him.

736
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,460
I will when I have one.

737
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:57,300
And...if I call you, I even give you good money.

738
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,170
That's true.

739
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:04,050
But you see, money isn't the solution to everything.

740
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:06,170
Then what is?

741
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,880
I must think of my future as well.

742
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:11,630
I see...

743
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:15,210
Then let's think about the future...

744
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:32,000
One day, I was sitting with Sanju, Kavita, and Rupali, in their room.

745
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:32,840
What are you watching?

746
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:33,500
What are you watching?

747
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:34,210
I want to see too.

748
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:34,670
Pooja.

749
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:35,630
I want to see too.

750
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:36,920
This is not for you.

751
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:38,340
What do you mean?

752
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:39,840
I mean you're too young.

753
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:40,880
No, I am not.

754
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,250
I understand everything pretty well.

755
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,210
Okay, let me watch.

756
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:47,380
You'll understand when you spend time with us.

757
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:50,170
Listen, I will complain about this to my mother.

758
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:51,380
Then you'll understand.

759
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:52,670
Your mom.

760
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:58,710
Nice.

761
01:08:58,880 --> 01:08:59,630
Yes, mom.

762
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:02,050
Pooja, where are you?

763
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:03,340
I am in Sanju's room.

764
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:05,000
What are you still doing in the hostel?

765
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,550
Don't you want to eat with me?

766
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:07,880
Food will be here soon.

767
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:08,840
What are you doing?

768
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:09,550
Yes, I am coming.

769
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:10,500
Two minutes.

770
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:12,050
You've been saying that...

771
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,630
Hello. Hello. Hello.

772
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,590
She hung up.

773
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:18,380
She's always...

774
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:19,750
Madam.

775
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:24,590
Since hostel closed down you stopped taking our calls.

776
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:26,300
We called you so many times

777
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:27,380
but why don't you answer.

778
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:29,500
There are only a few more hotties left...

779
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:31,590
...send them over for the Chief Minister.

780
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:33,630
You've already taken full advantage of Sanju.

781
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:36,960
Her holidays are due, let her go now.

782
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,880
Sanju is old news.

783
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:46,250
This is a new fragrance.

784
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:52,050
Look, we'll talk about this tomorrow in the office.

785
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:54,050
Please leave now.

786
01:09:58,880 --> 01:09:59,960
Isn't that the same girl?

787
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:01,920
From the function?

788
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:03,500
She is very beautiful.

789
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:05,800
The Chief Minister has lost his mind

790
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:07,630
since he saw her.

791
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:08,840
Show me.

792
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:11,420
You'll get his blessings.

793
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,300
No Shankar.

794
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:14,750
She is my daughter.

795
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:15,880
Leave her alone.

796
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,090
Once I deflower her, her life will be made.

797
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:22,050
Go and tell your brother-in-law to keep his feelings in control!

798
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:28,090
Sanju has kept all his pictures pretty safely.

799
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,550
It won't take me too long to publish it in the newspapers.

800
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:32,550
Understand!

801
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,880
I can take your brother-in-law's seat from him in a jiffy.

802
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,050
Now get out.

803
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:40,500
Get out!

804
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,750
The name is Shankar Yadav.

805
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,380
I am the CM's brother-in-law.

806
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,590
And how dare you threaten my brother-in-law!

807
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:15,920
Sanju!

808
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:16,750
Sanju!

809
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,090
Shankar killed my mother!

810
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:19,550
What?

811
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:20,500
Killed her.

812
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:26,000
Shankar was telling my mother that you and the CM are having an affair.

813
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:27,210
Are you?

814
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:28,130
Tell me?

815
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:29,340
Are you having an affair?

816
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,550
He was telling my mother that you have some photos.

817
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:33,170
Sanju.

818
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:34,090
Where are those photos?

819
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:35,670
Where are those photos and videos?

820
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,920
Tell me.

821
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,210
Where are those photos?

822
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,840
So Sanju?

823
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:47,920
I heard you've been showing a keen interest in photography.

824
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:49,670
Take my pictures as well.

825
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:50,340
Look.

826
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:51,500
Take one.

827
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:53,210
Click it. Click it.

828
01:11:57,590 --> 01:12:00,090
Didn't you want a ticket from brother-in-law?

829
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:06,460
But now it looks highly difficult.

830
01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:17,250
Shankar. I will kill you!

831
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,380
That day when I came out of the girl's hostel,

832
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,210
I fell unconscious immediately.

833
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:42,090
I don't remember what happened after that.

834
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:51,840
- Can you give a statement? - Yes, sir.

835
01:13:55,090 --> 01:14:02,000
You were talking about some video, photo, or MMS.

836
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:09,710
Sir, that day when I went to Sanju's room.

837
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,710
And asked about the photos.

838
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,170
'Which photos and videos?'

839
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:18,840
She hid a locket inside her t-shirt.

840
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:23,920
Locket?

841
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:27,630
- How is this connected with a locket? - I don't know, sir.

842
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:31,420
But she had a habit.

843
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:36,460
She used to keep all her photos and videos on a pen-drive.

844
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,840
Her...locket is her pen-drive, sir.

845
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,250
I am sure.

846
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:50,500
I am sure, sir.

847
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:06,380
Hello.

848
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:08,710
Ma'am, a huge crowd has gathered around here.

849
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,250
We'll need extra force.

850
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:12,090
Yes, I've already ordered for extra force,

851
01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:13,880
and I am on my way too.

852
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:15,170
Okay.

853
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:24,750
Soon, your beloved Minister will be with you.

854
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:27,800
Please maintain silence until he arrives.

855
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:29,300
-Jai Hind, sir. -Jai Hind, sir.

856
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,960
- Long live - Prasadi Lal...

857
01:16:42,050 --> 01:16:43,710
- Long live - Prasadi Lal...

858
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,750
- Long live - Prasadi Lal...

859
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:50,670
There are some people in this crowd...

860
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,500
...who don't want your beloved Minister's

861
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:55,000
rally to be successful.

862
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:55,800
And...

863
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,090
We don't want such a minister!

864
01:16:57,170 --> 01:16:57,550
Who is that?

865
01:16:57,590 --> 01:16:58,500
Throw him out!

866
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:12,800
Hey... Move!

867
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:16,460
Move!

868
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:22,420
What are you doing?

869
01:17:22,590 --> 01:17:23,750
I said move.

870
01:18:57,250 --> 01:19:02,380
'And the day you will try to be a hero of your department...'

871
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:04,420
'...someone will hunt you down.'

872
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:36,800
"Oh...beloved..."

873
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,920
"Oh...beloved..."

874
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:09,460
"Who do I tell...my heart to."

875
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:14,420
"My beloved left me alone..."

876
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:17,590
"Oh...beloved..."

877
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:19,210
"Oh...beloved..."

878
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:22,590
"Oh...my beloved..."

879
01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:24,750
"Oh...beloved..."

880
01:20:58,210 --> 01:21:02,880
"The union and separation with my beloved."

881
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:08,050
"The union and separation with my beloved."

882
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:15,000
"A moment...of happiness."

883
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:23,670
"A moment...of happiness."

884
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:31,840
"A moment...of happiness."

885
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:35,500
"I wonder what mistake I made..."

886
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:38,460
"...my heart is lost."

887
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:41,840
"Oh...beloved..."

888
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,550
"Oh...beloved..."

889
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:50,750
"Who do I tell...my heart to."

890
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:57,630
"My beloved left me alone..."

891
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:02,960
"My beloved left me alone..."

892
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:06,420
"Oh...beloved..."

893
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:08,210
"Oh...beloved..."

894
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:11,300
"Oh...my beloved..."

895
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:13,340
"Oh...beloved..."

896
01:22:35,090 --> 01:22:37,380
Rudra, what brings you here?

897
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,420
Come inside.

898
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:49,050
Sit.

899
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:03,670
I am resigning.

900
01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:08,000
Look Rudra, even I am sad about Aditi's death.

901
01:23:08,670 --> 01:23:11,920
But that doesn't mean that you resign from the Police Force.

902
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,460
All her life she worked within the norms of the Law.

903
01:23:19,550 --> 01:23:21,550
And my mistake was...

904
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:25,500
..that I listened to her.

905
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,920
But what I am going to next,

906
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:37,420
I can't do it as a Police officer.

907
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:41,710
A Police officer will break the law.

908
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:44,000
Yes.

909
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:48,880
Because I know you cannot help me.

910
01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:51,300
You are helpless.

911
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:59,710
So helpless that you have to tie a minister's shoelace.

912
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:09,590
My resignation.

913
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:11,340
See you.

914
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:12,630
Wait.

915
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:15,750
You're making a big mistake.

916
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:20,960
If I stop now, then no one can stop those rascals.

917
01:24:29,630 --> 01:24:34,880
Do you know what it means?

918
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:42,250
Eradicating unrighteousness is not a sin.

919
01:24:43,550 --> 01:24:48,460
How long will keep obeying these Minister just to save our jobs...

920
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:50,920
...and stay at their beck and call?

921
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:52,130
How long?

922
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:56,710
This uniform, which we should respect...

923
01:24:57,090 --> 01:24:59,840
...but these ministers are humiliating it.

924
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:07,500
Rudra Pratap Singh Chauhan, you can do whatever you think is right.

925
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:11,130
Your Department fully supports you.

926
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:17,420
SP Aditi Singh's martyrdom won't go waste.

927
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:41,340
"The one that's called youth."

928
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:46,840
"Is trouble all the way."

929
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:51,670
"Its trouble to hide it."

930
01:25:51,880 --> 01:26:01,210
"And...it's troubling showing it too."

931
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:05,210
"O, beloved..."

932
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:07,460
"O, beloved..."

933
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:23,460
"O, beloved...people flirt with me."

934
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:26,170
"O, beloved...people stare at me."

935
01:26:26,210 --> 01:26:28,750
"O, beloved...people ogle at me."

936
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,340
"People taunt me."

937
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:35,840
"My youth has become trouble for me."

938
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:39,550
"As your veil slips down..."

939
01:26:39,630 --> 01:26:42,090
"Walk carefully."

940
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:44,670
"There are many Romeos around here."

941
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:47,420
"They won't listen to an excuse."

942
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:51,050
"Otherwise...you'll be calling out your beloved."

943
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:53,670
"O, beloved...people flirt with me."

944
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:56,500
"O, beloved...people stare at me."

945
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:35,920
"I just turned 16...and on my way to 17."

946
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,630
"My youth is now in danger."

947
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,380
"Everyone's crazy about my youth..."

948
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,130
"...like bees hovering on a flower."

949
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:50,960
"I am in trouble...after making wrong gestures."

950
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:55,960
"Why did you put...kohl in your eyes?"

951
01:27:56,130 --> 01:28:01,130
"Why did lace your tresses with flowers?"

952
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:06,000
"Why did you deck yourself?"

953
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:10,420
"That's why everyone teases you."

954
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:14,710
"I am scared of their prying eyes."

955
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,550
"O, beloved...people flirt with me."

956
01:28:17,630 --> 01:28:20,800
"O, beloved...people stare at me."

957
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:59,710
"Who will I kiss...whose beloved will I be?"

958
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:05,000
"All my lovers are after me."

959
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:10,000
"The Policeman says...take my bungalow."

960
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:15,050
"And the trader's son squanders all his earnings."

961
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:20,340
"Why did you shine your trinket?"

962
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:25,380
"And wear a gold chain around your waist."

963
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:30,340
"Why did you come out of your house alone?"

964
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:34,300
"That's why everyone's crazy about you."

965
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:37,500
"The fish has taken the bait."

966
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:41,960
"O, beloved...people flirt with me."

967
01:29:42,050 --> 01:29:45,710
"O, beloved...people stare at me."

968
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:48,460
"O, beloved..."

969
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:51,090
"O, beloved..."

970
01:29:51,170 --> 01:29:53,500
"O, beloved..."

971
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:55,500
"O, beloved..."

972
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,250
Give him a grand welcome.

973
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:14,710
Go on!

974
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:53,880
Kill the rascal!

975
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:52,460
My Aditi won't come back if I kill you.

976
01:35:53,090 --> 01:35:57,460
But if I spare you today, then someone else might regret.

977
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:03,420
I told you, that I will fix your time of death.

978
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:07,380
Today is Dussera.

979
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:11,380
"The time to slay evil is Dussera."

980
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:13,630
"The time to wage war is Dussera."

981
01:36:13,670 --> 01:36:15,750
"The time to do justice is Dussera."

982
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:19,300
"Dussera is the time to conquer over evil."

983
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:29,500
- Long live... - Prasadi Lal!

984
01:36:29,590 --> 01:36:31,670
- Long live... - Prasadi Lal!

985
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:34,460
- Long live... - Prasadi Lal!

986
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:22,250
Greetings.

987
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:23,420
Shankar.

988
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:24,500
Shankar.

989
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,000
Where is Shankar?

990
01:38:26,170 --> 01:38:27,590
Didn't you invite him?

991
01:38:30,050 --> 01:38:34,550
Blessings to all of you on the occasion of Dussera.

992
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:44,340
DGP.

993
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:45,420
DGP, come here.

994
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:51,130
What kind of Ravan is this?

995
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:57,250
It took him 10 heads to abduct one Sita.

996
01:38:57,460 --> 01:39:02,920
And I alone...have send the entire state hostage with one head.

997
01:39:04,710 --> 01:39:07,630
"The time to slay evil is Dussera."

998
01:39:07,670 --> 01:39:10,340
"The time to wage war is Dussera."

999
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:13,250
"The time to do justice is Dussera."

1000
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:15,340
"Dussera is the time to conquer over evil."

1001
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:17,210
"The time to wage war is Dussera."

1002
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:19,710
"The time to wage war is Dussera."

1003
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,840
"The time to wage war is Dussera."

1004
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:24,590
"Dussera is the time to conquer over evil."

1005
01:40:20,630 --> 01:40:26,250
Do you see...the condition of the state?

1006
01:40:26,630 --> 01:40:36,090
Look...a low-rank Police officer like you can never harm me.

1007
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:39,590
I am the CM of this state.

1008
01:40:40,050 --> 01:40:42,670
My name is Prasadi Lal.

1009
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:50,670
I control the people.

1010
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:54,300
Did you forget what happened to your wife?

1011
01:40:58,750 --> 01:41:00,630
I won't kill you.

1012
01:41:01,710 --> 01:41:05,670
The people will kill you.

1013
01:41:06,090 --> 01:41:08,550
They love me a lot.

1014
01:41:09,210 --> 01:41:11,300
I am the king.

1015
01:41:11,710 --> 01:41:14,500
My name is Prasadi Lal!

1016
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:31,550
Don't you have anything else to say?

1017
01:41:33,630 --> 01:41:34,710
Go on.

1018
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:37,460
Lecture me.

1019
01:41:39,670 --> 01:41:41,750
But now it's my turn to speak.

1020
01:41:43,710 --> 01:41:48,090
The people you were talking about, that's us.

1021
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:51,960
UPSC!

1022
01:41:53,050 --> 01:41:55,000
Union Public Service Commission!

1023
01:41:57,340 --> 01:42:02,050
We are not your servants, to clean your shoes.

1024
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:06,840
We are public servants.

1025
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:08,710
Look...

1026
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:13,250
Look what your people are saying about you.

1027
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:21,000
I was in the girl's college myself.

1028
01:42:21,090 --> 01:42:23,630
At that time...

1029
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,380
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!

1030
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:29,920
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!

1031
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,630
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!

1032
01:42:31,710 --> 01:42:33,460
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!

1033
01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:52,920
Sometimes for the sake of the law and the country, you have to break the Law.

1034
01:42:54,050 --> 01:42:59,130
And, if I don't take an initiative now, then justice will never be done.

1035
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:03,460
And justice will be done today.

1036
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:06,340
Get up.

1037
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:07,960
No. No. No.

1038
01:43:08,050 --> 01:43:09,880
What did you say?

1039
01:43:11,210 --> 01:43:13,090
No. No. No.

1040
01:43:13,170 --> 01:43:16,750
"The time to wage war is Dussera."

1041
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:18,880
"The time to do justice is Dussera."

1042
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:21,710
"Dussera is the time to conquer over evil."
