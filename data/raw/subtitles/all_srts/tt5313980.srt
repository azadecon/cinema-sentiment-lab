Sister with a turtle neck!

I can see hunger in your eyes!

97
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,958
Do you wanna eat something?

98
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:20,653
Yen.

99
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:23,923
Enough Sir! I'll die of high blood
pressure.

100
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,364
Eat.

101
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:28,425
I have been toyed enough
by these recording companies!

102
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:32,199
I am off to my village
and back to farming!

103
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,939
Anyway. what do you do?

104

Well.. I have been trying to make a
film.

Only recently someone's face.

Gave me an idea!

107
00:08:41,137 --> 00:08:42,047
Congratulations Sir!

108
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,344
Whose face is it?

109
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:47,283
Yours!

110
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:48,617
My face?

111
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:51,081
You ought to be joking!

112
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:52,421
No.. No.. It's true.

113
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,617
Look my boy.. you will
become a Star!

114
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:59,263
But this captivating face..
But not by your nightmarish voice.

115
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:05,229
What is so intriguing about
my gorgeous face?

116
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:11,071
Osama!

117
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:16,513
You will be the Osama Bin
Laden of my film!

118
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,081
One minute Sir!

119
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:26,324

Every street will have your posters!

122
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:32,426
I'll give you five
million rupees in cash too!

123
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:34,592
Atleast tell me your name?

124
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:36,926
Singh..

125
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,267
Paddi Singh!

126
00:09:48,404 --> 00:09:50,077
Imagine this Shetty Sisters!

127
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:53,254
A man wants to become a world
famous journalist.

128
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:57,416
Suddenly, he meets an
Osama look alike.

129
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:01,360
He hatches a plan and releases
a fake Osama tape.

130
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,260
Creating a
havoc in the world!

131
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,371
By the way.. I have even found
an Osama look alike!

132
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:14,263
Paddi.

133
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,502
Slide In.. Quick!

134
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:17,099
Stop.

135
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,175
Turn..

136
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:20,042
- Hey Soul Sisters!
- Profile.

137
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:21,179
Walk.

138
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:29,088
And the name of
this film will be..

139
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:31,485
'Tere Bin Laden'

140
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,035
AIL.

141
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,036
The shot's ready for an hour!

142
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:46,003
AIL.

143
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:52,077
AIL.

144
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,648
Why is he acting so starry..
Is this not his first film as well?

145
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,622
Mind blowing Ali..

146
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:10,296
One more!

147
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:12,923
You will not get eggs
like mine in the world.

148
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:15,264
Feel them in your hands!

149
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:16,529
And cut it!

150
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:18,130
Location change!

151
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,702
We will make him..

152
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:23,409
Look like Osama and make a fake tape.

153
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:24,638
And Action.

154
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:29,207
Oh all mighty! Save me!

155
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,974
Keep your mouth shut!

156
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,553
Forget the mouth..
What about my eyes?

157
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:36,182
I'm a method actor.

158
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:39,052
And I'm doing Osama's
make-up in the film.

159
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:43,057
To prepare myself. I pasted
Osama's posters all over my trailer!

160
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,164
I wanna absorb his face!

161
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:57,370
I haven't written Arabic in this
film..

162
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:59,479
I'm just acting!

163
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:02,376
I swear on my virginity.. I have
nothing against Osama!

164
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:04,344
Please emphasize this!

165
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,426
Rahul Singh..

166
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,190
Is not a mimicry artist!

167
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:17,196
I'm an actor.

168
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:18,994
Well, I do mimic sometimes for fun!

169
00:12:19,054 --> 00:12:22,558
When Sharma begged me to mimic
Osama. Out of pity I agreed!

170
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:34,339
No Sikandan. No...

171
00:12:34,403 --> 00:12:36,576
Cut it! The rooster blew
up late..One more!

172
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:43,256
No Sikandan. No...

173
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,350
Damn it! This time it blew up
early.. One more!

174
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,993
Yo bud! Collect the leg pieces..
Might as well have breakfast!

175
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:11,016
Greetings friends!

176
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:13,053

Tere Bin Laden. makes a big
noise at the box office..

179
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:22,191
People have accepted the portrayal of a fake
Osama in superstar Ali Zafar's debut film..

180
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,031
Is this not Cultural Terrorism?

181
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:31,264
Our question goes out to the makers of this
film about an International Terrorist.

182
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:33,405
Where is the real Osama?

183
00:13:48,544 --> 00:13:50,251

He's a good looking "jackass".

278
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:46,070
He's a good looking "jackass".

279
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:47,735
He's a jackass indeed!

280
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:49,704
Sir..

281
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:51,744
I kept giving a star look..

282
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:55,638
But nobody even recognised me..
And now my eyes hurt!

283
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:57,741
Paddi.

284
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,250
Nobody cares even if you were a
blind street monger!

285
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:02,146
What about me?!

286
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,746
I gave up everything.

287
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:07,318
Those dark alleys of Chandini chovvk..

288
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:08,985

Now when I was so close to my dream.

292
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,434
Ali swept it from me..

293
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:18,232
And stole my limelight!

294
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:20,162
Sir..

295
00:21:20,228 --> 00:21:21,400
Now bury the hatchet.

296
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:23,134
Screw the sequel!

297
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,542
I don't want to be Osama any more!

298
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:27,174
Anyway...

299
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:30,140
You clear my accounts and off
I go.. back to my village!

300
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,242
Why are we getting into accounts?

301
00:21:32,274 --> 00:21:34,083
Don't get emotional!

302
00:21:34,142 --> 00:21:36,122
And if you
leave this film..

303
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,248
This film can't be made.

304
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:42,355
If you leave this film..

305
00:21:42,584 --> 00:21:44,188
This film can't be made.

306
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:45,492
You can leave this film..

307
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:47,564
But you are not going
to leave this film.

308
00:21:48,123 --> 00:21:50,626
So am I doing it or not?

309
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:37,541
AbottabacL.

310
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,479

328
00:23:09,571 --> 00:23:11,517
But now I want to become a superstan.

329

So I demand that you kick Ali out ..

330
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:15,954

332
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:24,462
They are nodding
their heads vigorously..

Have you booted out
Ali from the sequel?

What is going on?

354
00:24:20,942 --> 00:24:23,388
Why are all of you standing

Osama Bin Laden is dead!

369
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,349
The face that terrorized
the whole world..

370
00:24:57,546 --> 00:25:00,049
Has been sprayed with
American bullets!

371
00:25:00,115 --> 00:25:02,356
Now the only question standing.

372
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,193
What will happen.
Without you Bin Laden?

373
00:25:05,554 --> 00:25:06,624
Yes!

374
00:25:07,322 --> 00:25:08,995
You heard it right!

375
00:25:09,391 --> 00:25:11,632
Osama is DEAD!

376
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,164
DEAD!

377
00:25:13,295 --> 00:25:14,239
DEAD!

378
00:25:14,563 --> 00:25:15,541
DEAD!

379
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:17,066
DEAD!

380
00:25:17,232 --> 00:25:18,108
DEAD!

381
00:26:15,957 --> 00:26:17,061
DEAD!

382
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,229
Love struck like a hurricane.

383
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,134
Shook the world and gave it pain!

384
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,574
Love struck like a hurricane.

385
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:27,140
Shook the world and gave it pain!

386
00:26:34,943 --> 00:26:36,217
Proof?

387
00:26:38,947 --> 00:26:39,652
DEAD!

388
00:26:48,957 --> 00:26:53,337
Pressure is mounting on America
to prove that Osama is dead!

389
00:26:53,395 --> 00:26:58,276
The world wants to see the video
where Osama was killed!

390
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:00,571
Sir.. Listen to me!

391
00:27:01,002 --> 00:27:02,709
What are you doing Paddi?

392
00:27:03,505 --> 00:27:04,483
Sir!

393
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,280
Osama is dead in the sea!

394
00:27:06,341 --> 00:27:08,548
And the sequel is dead in the rubble!

395
00:27:08,943 --> 00:27:12,186
Trust me! Trying to chase
stardom is stupid!

396
00:27:13,148 --> 00:27:14,218
Anyway...

397
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:18,463
You just clear my accounts and
off I go to my village!

398
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,193
Paddi! Why are the accounts
coming up?

399
00:27:23,925 --> 00:27:26,098
I am the director of a hit film!

400
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,104
I will not give up so easily.

401
00:27:28,296 --> 00:27:31,641
Once this Osama's death dies out.

402
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,445
Producers will be
calling me non-stop!

403
00:27:33,501 --> 00:27:35,071
- Really!
- Obviously!

404
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:38,008
Holy Milk of a cow.. It's ringing!

405
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:42,081
Pick it up.. And put it on speaker!

406
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,115
Hello..

407
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,028
Sharma.

408
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:54,431
L-low does it feel to have your
self respect tarnished?

409
00:27:55,023 --> 00:27:59,028
L-low dare you chuck me off
the film, you piece of crap!

410
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:03,603
I hope you realize how unworthy
your existence is.

411
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:05,504
Oh Yes!

412
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,312
Ask your tone deaf villager
to put his head between

413
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,441
between his legs and
run back to his farm!

414
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,017
ShitWit!

415
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:17,087
Sir..

416
00:28:17,212 --> 00:28:18,418
Sir.. Sir..

417
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,393
No! Don't jump! Don't!

418
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:25,493
Stop overacting Paddi!

419
00:28:25,553 --> 00:28:27,157
Might hurt your tender knees.

420
00:28:27,222 --> 00:28:29,065
I have to turn the game now..

421
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,296
I'll return in a bit!

422
00:28:30,525 --> 00:28:33,267
Can you get some Broccoli
on the way back?

423
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,439
Buzz off!

424
00:28:34,562 --> 00:28:38,908
Harkat-e-Mansha shut down!
Harkat-e-Mansha shut down!

425
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,437
Shame on you Khaleeli!

426
00:28:42,504 --> 00:28:45,974
Your bombs and arms are all dud!
No point of Terrorism without blood!

427
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,018
Quiet!

428
00:28:47,075 --> 00:28:49,919
- For the sake of terrorism.
- Listen to me please!

429
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,286
Why should we listen?

430
00:28:51,346 --> 00:28:55,317
Your suicide bombers are
not bursting properly!

431
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:58,257
Instead they turn into
a fireworks display!

432
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,662
Look at him..

433
00:29:00,355 --> 00:29:02,426
Burning like a candle in the wind!

434
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:06,437
We signed up to be blown into
martyrdom. But in vain!

435
00:29:06,694 --> 00:29:07,502
Now compensate!

436
00:29:07,562 --> 00:29:09,439
We need compensation!

437
00:29:09,597 --> 00:29:12,441
We need compensation. Compensation!

438
00:29:13,902 --> 00:29:15,540
After the death of Osama.

439
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:18,316
The cost of arms and ammunition
has gone up ten folds..

440
00:29:18,373 --> 00:29:21,013
So we are using gun powder of
one grenade into three!

441
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:23,521
That's why you are not
attaining heaven..

442
00:29:23,645 --> 00:29:28,219
Let me assure you that we are a
passionate terrorist group!

443
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,654
Give us one last chance!

444
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:36,501
Tonight we have a special screening of
some great tapes of Osama bin Laden.

445
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:39,895
Also, we are serving
dinner and drinks.

446
00:29:40,061 --> 00:29:42,337
So kindly join us for
an Osama Retrospective

447
00:29:42,397 --> 00:29:44,434
and make peace with our great loss!

448
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:00,471
Did you give our gifts?

449
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:02,708
No! They almost shoved
it up my butt!

450
00:32:02,971 --> 00:32:05,747
No one is ready to accept our arms!

451
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:10,983
No sweat! Atleast they are here..

452
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,422
Now you see, how Osama's face
gets us a rain of donations!

453
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:25,229
Hey hottie!

454
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,136
Do you wanna get lucky tonight?

455
00:32:28,396 --> 00:32:29,966
It's a scandal!

456
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:33,236
It's fake! Burn it down!

457
00:32:33,568 --> 00:32:35,275
What happened Sir?

458
00:32:40,108 --> 00:32:41,018
You didn't like it?

459
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:45,450
I swear!

460
00:32:45,613 --> 00:32:47,490
I made a big mistake!

461
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:51,360
My son added a cheap Bollywood
film to the Osama tapes.

462
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:52,625
But what to do Sir!

463
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:56,567
This clown has an uncanny
resemblance to Osama.

464
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:58,437
It could fool anyone!

465
00:33:04,298 --> 00:33:05,174
Stop!

466
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:10,381
Get all these jokers here!

467
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:13,919
We need to send a
message to the world..

468
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:17,122
Osama is still.. A LIVE.

469
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:26,081
My name is David Cheddar.

470
00:34:32,053 --> 00:34:33,259
My name is David Cheddar.

471
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,527
My name is David Cheddar.

472
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:37,659
My name is David Chadha. dha. dha.

473
00:34:38,292 --> 00:34:39,293
Sounds right now!

474
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,498
Hello Mr. Paddi.

475
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,938
Myself, David Chadha.

476
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:51,075
And I want to.. KILL YOU!

477
00:34:58,379 --> 00:35:01,952
Please come in!
Consider it your own house.

478
00:35:02,383 --> 00:35:03,521
This is my bedroom.

479
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:09,466
Where I personally cast all my actors!

480
00:35:10,391 --> 00:35:14,168
This is the living room where
I wrote my first film!

481
00:35:14,328 --> 00:35:15,398
Very positive vibes!

482
00:35:15,463 --> 00:35:18,444
And this is the bathroom
where I got my first.

483
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:20,308
Naked Man!

484
00:35:21,235 --> 00:35:22,305
Hello Ma'am!

485
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,313
No.. Positive vibes..

486
00:35:27,508 --> 00:35:29,317
Paddi. What is wrong with you?

487
00:35:29,443 --> 00:35:31,150
I told you not to be home today!

488
00:35:31,612 --> 00:35:32,920
See, the party ran off..

489
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,085
Now how will I sell this house?

490
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,388
What are you saying?

491
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,191
You forced me to sell my
farm to buy this house!

492
00:35:38,252 --> 00:35:40,323
Now if you sell the house..
Where will we go?

493
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:44,300
You don't get it..
If I don't sell this house..

494
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:46,031
L-low will I complete my film'?

495
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,971
And how will I make you a star?

496
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:53,976
Must be another party.

497
00:35:54,035 --> 00:35:57,107
Please wrap a towel and stay inside.

498
00:36:01,008 --> 00:36:03,249
Mr. Tuteja! Please come in!

499
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:04,654
Mr. Chadha not Tuteja.

500
00:36:04,712 --> 00:36:08,319
What's in the name sir...
I am just selling the house.

501
00:36:10,017 --> 00:36:11,963
I don't want this house!

502
00:36:12,486 --> 00:36:14,488
Myself, David Chadha!

503
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,296
Film Producer!

504
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,663
And I want Paddi Singh.

505
00:36:19,393 --> 00:36:20,428
Paddi!

506
00:36:20,494 --> 00:36:21,529
Paddi come out fast!

507
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,939
There's a producer in the house!

508
00:36:22,997 --> 00:36:24,237
Producer!

509
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,070
Ma'am!

510
00:36:27,235 --> 00:36:28,305
Oh.. Hello!

511
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:30,679
Oh.. Hello!
It's an honour to meet you!

512
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,544
Took a bath after the apocalypse?
Welcome him!

513
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:36,920
It's fresh!

514
00:36:37,411 --> 00:36:38,515
So Mr. Paddi.

515
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:43,224
We want to make a film with you..

516
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,429
Film!

517
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:45,225
Where?

518
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,230
There!

519
00:36:46,487 --> 00:36:47,261
Where?

520
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,096
There!

521
00:36:48,155 --> 00:36:49,133
Where.. There?

522
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,291
Hollywood!

523
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:01,441
Why're you sitting down. Sit up!

524
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:05,550
Please join your legs! It's peeping!

525
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:09,482
So Mr. Paddi.

526
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,520
What will you have?

527
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,453
Tea.

528
00:37:11,512 --> 00:37:12,422
Coffee..

529
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,424
Or role?

530
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:17,963
Role, of course!

531
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:21,099
And I'll have a cappuccino. Quick!

532
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,634
Sir! Add some extra milk..

533
00:37:24,525 --> 00:37:25,435
They are from abroad!

534
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:27,003
Make it frothy!

535
00:37:29,297 --> 00:37:30,605
So Mr. Chadha!

536
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,978
What do I have to do?

537
00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:39,483
You have to Die!

538
00:37:39,907 --> 00:37:40,647
What!

539
00:37:42,143 --> 00:37:43,281
In the film!

540
00:37:44,211 --> 00:37:45,087
In the film!

541
00:37:45,146 --> 00:37:46,352
I almost wet the couch!

542
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,989
Name of the film is..

543
00:37:48,382 --> 00:37:49,520
Tora Bora Nights!

544
00:37:50,451 --> 00:37:53,330
The film starts with Osama being shot!

545
00:37:53,621 --> 00:37:54,395
Bam!

546
00:37:57,658 --> 00:37:58,693
And then.

547
00:37:58,926 --> 00:37:59,495
And then?

548
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,003
And then.

549
00:38:02,063 --> 00:38:03,167
And then the flashback!

550
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,300
Flashback?

551
00:38:04,432 --> 00:38:07,106
Yup! It's like the last.

552
00:38:07,234 --> 00:38:10,306
Let's imagine the last
4 days of Osama's life..

553
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:14,444
It's like Sholay..
Meets the Mughal-e-Azam.

554
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,022
Meets the Hurt locker.

555
00:38:17,945 --> 00:38:19,322
It's tailored for an Oscar!

556
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,518
I'll do it Mr. Chadha!

557
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:21,582
Join your legs! It's peeping again!

558
00:38:21,649 --> 00:38:24,391
Congratulations! Sign the contract.

559
00:38:25,286 --> 00:38:26,560
Mr. Chadha.

560
00:38:27,254 --> 00:38:28,631
I have a request to make.

561
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:29,890
Request?

562
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:31,299
I want that.

563
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:34,936
For this film.. the director.

564
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,566
Should be my mentor. Mr. Sharma!

565
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,043
Mr. Chadha.

566
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,673
Only he can take care of me and make
me look and act like Osama!

567
00:38:42,937 --> 00:38:43,972
Don't say no Mr. Chadha.

568
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:45,449
I beg of you!

569
00:38:45,506 --> 00:38:46,610
Sir, he looks like a country man.

570
00:38:46,674 --> 00:38:49,086
Only Sharma can make
him look like the real Osama.

571
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,121
We'll dispose them both after the op!

572
00:38:51,345 --> 00:38:53,188
Done deal!

573
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,588
Sir come on.. They got tricked!

574
00:38:59,687 --> 00:39:03,134
Mr. David. I got one question.

575
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,565
What is you company's name?

576
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,070
Cm!

577
00:39:07,395 --> 00:39:09,102
That's right. CIA.

578
00:39:09,163 --> 00:39:11,541
Cinema in America!

579
00:39:13,401 --> 00:39:16,007
So consider it a 40 day schedule..

580
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:19,515
Location of the first day is
somewhere in.. Uh.. Somewhere!

581
00:39:19,874 --> 00:39:21,876
And after that.

582
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:23,219
Where?

583
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,347
Hollywood!

584
00:39:25,046 --> 00:39:27,117
What a smart boy!

585
00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:29,660
Here.. Put your thumb print.

586
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:32,963
Mr. Chadha.

587
00:39:33,154 --> 00:39:34,656
I have a confession..

588
00:39:36,023 --> 00:39:38,230
I don't have a passport!

589
00:39:40,494 --> 00:39:41,996
You don't need a passport!

590
00:39:42,196 --> 00:39:43,504
We will take you Hollywood style!

591
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,043
Don't worry Mr. David. I'll explain..

592
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,010
I know Hollywood!!

593
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:48,672
So, the car will reach
at 8 in the morning..

594
00:39:48,936 --> 00:39:50,415
Make sure that you are ready. OK!

595
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:51,449
So long then!

596
00:39:54,942 --> 00:39:56,649
Live to die!

597
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:01,191
Is this your mole?

598
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,388
Oh.. It's detachable!

599
00:40:05,186 --> 00:40:06,187
Hollywood!

600
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,994
OK then. Come on Junior let's go.

601
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,160
Bye! Mr. Chadha!

602
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,473
Thanks Paddi.

603
00:40:15,696 --> 00:40:17,300
Return gift to my Mentor!

604
00:40:17,932 --> 00:40:19,206
Wash my cup!

605
00:40:24,972 --> 00:40:26,542
You, grave diggers.
Where are you going?

606
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:27,585
Who are you?

607
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:29,143
Who me?

608
00:40:29,376 --> 00:40:30,446
Tourist!

609
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:31,612
No..Tourist!

610
00:40:32,313 --> 00:40:33,257
OK go!

611
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,330
He is the circus leader.

612
00:40:42,656 --> 00:40:44,067
Let's catch him first!

613
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,343
My mommy says.

614
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:02,180
Do what you wanna
do slowly slowly..

615
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,383
My daddy says.

616
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:09,286
What's the point
of having such muscles.

617
00:41:10,284 --> 00:41:17,600
I said, I have valour in
my heart and fire in the belly..

618
00:41:17,658 --> 00:41:19,399
So the world says wow..

619
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,998
And I say 'save a cow'..

620
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:26,339
Why don't you lick
my 1..2..3..4..5..6..

621
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,471
These are my Six Pack Abs!

622
00:41:28,536 --> 00:41:29,981
Six Pack!

623
00:41:30,204 --> 00:41:32,377
My baby finds them fab..

624
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,620
These are my Six Pack Abs!

625
00:41:35,676 --> 00:41:37,121
Six Pack!

626
00:41:37,178 --> 00:41:39,158
Girls follow me in a cab..

627
00:41:40,214 --> 00:41:42,626
These are my Six Pack Abs!

628
00:41:42,683 --> 00:41:44,185
Six Pack!

629
00:41:46,287 --> 00:41:47,561
Six Pack!

630
00:41:50,024 --> 00:41:51,367
Six Pack!

631
00:41:52,793 --> 00:41:55,433
We can't catch this guy.

632
00:41:55,563 --> 00:41:59,067
Why don't we get Osama directly?

633
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,139
Sir.. I have packed your underwears...

634
00:42:02,336 --> 00:42:03,644
Pass my undies so I can
pack them as well..

635
00:42:03,704 --> 00:42:05,377
Can you think above your waist?

636
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,950
It's ringing!

637
00:42:08,008 --> 00:42:10,181
Hi this is Ali, The Star!

638
00:42:10,244 --> 00:42:12,986
If you are a babe, please
leave your address and figure size..

639
00:42:13,047 --> 00:42:14,185
I'll get you picked.

640
00:42:14,248 --> 00:42:18,094
And if you are a man! Speak fast or
my phone will disconnect!

641
00:42:18,185 --> 00:42:20,131
You Nymphomaniac!

642
00:42:20,254 --> 00:42:22,234
Keep screwing your bimbos!

643
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:24,633
We are off to Hollywood!

644
00:42:25,092 --> 00:42:27,504
You are the unworthy one!
Bloody Bollywood clown!

645
00:42:28,495 --> 00:42:33,205
Speak up you knuckle head!
Cat bit your tongue or what?

646
00:42:33,267 --> 00:42:34,940
Paddi. The phone is disconnected!

647
00:42:35,002 --> 00:42:37,414
Call him again!
I wanna abuse his sister!

648
00:42:40,608 --> 00:42:43,145
I think these guys are here..

649
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,317
But they are an hour early?

650
00:42:45,546 --> 00:42:49,653
It's Hollywood Paddi.
Pack the bags quick!

651
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,623
According to the
plan..You go upstairs.

652
00:42:52,953 --> 00:42:54,523
Ring the bell.. Ting Tong!

653
00:42:54,955 --> 00:42:56,059
That clown will come out.

654
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,693
I will put a blanket on him and
close the door behind!

655
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:02,969
Khaleeli Sir ordered.

656
00:43:03,097 --> 00:43:05,407
For you to ring the bell twice.

657
00:43:05,532 --> 00:43:07,341
Ting Tong!!

658
00:43:07,534 --> 00:43:08,945
The man might be sleeping..

659
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:12,177
As he comes out, I will put
a blanket on him..

660
00:43:12,306 --> 00:43:14,411
And then bash him!

661
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:16,487
No.. No.. You will ring the bell!

662
00:43:16,543 --> 00:43:21,356
That clown will come out.
Bulla try and understand!

663
00:43:21,415 --> 00:43:24,919
No! That is not Khaleeli Sir's order!

664
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,363
What a rainbow colored van!

665
00:43:32,393 --> 00:43:33,929
Osama!

666
00:43:34,261 --> 00:43:35,501
Osama!

667
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,704
Paddi, they are big fans of yours!

668
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:40,578
I'm blushing!

669
00:43:40,934 --> 00:43:41,969
Come on let's go!

670
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,481
You will also pile on?

671
00:43:44,238 --> 00:43:45,478
Idiot!

672
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:49,385
Start driving.
Your boss knows all about it.

673
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,296
You missed the left to the airport!

674
00:43:58,485 --> 00:44:00,089
We are going by road..

675
00:44:00,154 --> 00:44:02,293
And switch off your phones!

676
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:03,697
Why?

677
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:06,096
Paddi quiet! It's Hollywood..

678
00:44:07,995 --> 00:44:09,201
Look at the detailing!

679
00:44:09,496 --> 00:44:10,998
Even the drivers are in costumes..

680
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,602
That's why I love Hollywood!

681
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:21,249
Sing in the right pitch Sir!

682
00:44:24,545 --> 00:44:25,956
Stop it!

683
00:44:26,447 --> 00:44:28,688
Please. Music is a sin.

684
00:44:29,016 --> 00:44:30,495
Relax dude! It's gibberish...

685
00:44:30,684 --> 00:44:32,994
What a dimwit. You keep singing!

686
00:44:43,063 --> 00:44:45,134
Trace their phones..

687
00:45:04,218 --> 00:45:06,255
Sir.. I am driving. Vroom!

688
00:45:07,154 --> 00:45:08,098
Mr. David!

689
00:45:08,155 --> 00:45:09,065
We love you!

690
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,227
We love Hollywood!

691
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,361
Your guys are also enjoying..
Wait I'll show you

692
00:45:12,426 --> 00:45:14,372
David has sent real bufoons!

693
00:45:14,528 --> 00:45:16,530
Switch off the camera.

694
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:18,637
Switch off the camera.

695
00:45:21,402 --> 00:45:22,642
Where did they go?

696
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:25,916
Ah... Very good..

697
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:28,542
The midget can walk.
And the eyes are intense!

698
00:45:29,176 --> 00:45:31,452
You don't get it.. Do you?!

699
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,286
You threw my iPhone?

700
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:39,456
This is no way to treat a Director!

701
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,295
I'll tell Mr. David.

702
00:45:41,955 --> 00:45:44,333
I'll complain to
our Directors' union..

703
00:46:48,589 --> 00:46:49,966
Saale khacchar!

704
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:01,503
Screw Hollywood!

705
00:48:02,029 --> 00:48:04,202
I have lost my butt cheeks!

706
00:48:04,331 --> 00:48:05,071
Paddi.

707
00:48:05,232 --> 00:48:06,540
Don't be fussy..

708
00:48:09,236 --> 00:48:10,271
This is our last chance...

709
00:48:10,404 --> 00:48:11,883
If we don't do this right.

710
00:48:11,939 --> 00:48:15,216
We will be making wedding
videos next. Star look!

711
00:48:16,944 --> 00:48:18,946
They have worked like asses!

712
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,220
And I love the location. Beautiful!

713
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,893
Somewhere in.. Somewhere!

714
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:28,659
I love it!

715
00:48:28,956 --> 00:48:30,196
Where is David?

716
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:32,229
David Chadha.

717
00:48:33,927 --> 00:48:35,099
DO.

718
00:48:36,063 --> 00:48:37,565
Where are you?

719
00:48:39,066 --> 00:48:40,477
Mr. David.

720
00:48:41,535 --> 00:48:42,570
Wow..

721
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:44,140
Intense..

722
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:47,151
I like the detailing.

723
00:48:47,374 --> 00:48:48,148
Nice..

724
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:50,984
Daaga. I think the frame should.

725
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,213
Start from here..

726
00:48:52,446 --> 00:48:53,652
Do you have a Dolly?

727
00:48:54,047 --> 00:48:55,685
There is no dolly but we have Khaleeli.

728
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:58,427
Oh wow.. New equipment.
I love Hollywood!

729
00:48:58,619 --> 00:48:59,359
Where is it?

730
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,358
Is it there?

731
00:49:01,622 --> 00:49:02,965
Sir?

732
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:04,200
Video camera!

733
00:49:04,424 --> 00:49:05,402
Interesting.

734
00:49:05,993 --> 00:49:08,098
It's stinking in here Bulla.

735
00:49:08,228 --> 00:49:09,901
Do you guys take a
leak in here or something?

736
00:49:11,999 --> 00:49:13,307
What the...?

737
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:18,046
Sir..

738
00:49:18,105 --> 00:49:19,106
Sir..

739
00:49:19,506 --> 00:49:21,076
What the hell?

740
00:49:31,652 --> 00:49:32,562
What happened?

741
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:33,887
Sugandha baby?

742
00:49:35,622 --> 00:49:38,296
What a prank!
I love Hollywood!

743
00:49:38,358 --> 00:49:39,928
These are our actors.

744
00:49:40,327 --> 00:49:42,000
Guys cheer up..

745
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,370
You are in Hollywood..

746
00:49:44,631 --> 00:49:46,406
Who called these pile ones?

747
00:49:46,633 --> 00:49:47,976
Hollywood..

748
00:49:48,035 --> 00:49:49,070
Of course, Hollywood..

749
00:49:55,542 --> 00:49:56,316
Hollywood..

750
00:49:56,376 --> 00:49:57,286
Shut up!

751
00:50:08,555 --> 00:50:09,499
My-

752
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,027
Osama!

753
00:50:20,701 --> 00:50:22,408
Come to daddy! Come to daddy!

754
00:50:22,669 --> 00:50:23,613
Sir..

755
00:50:24,337 --> 00:50:26,112
I don't like his intentions..

756
00:50:28,141 --> 00:50:30,087
Finally!

757
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:31,220
Finally!

758
00:50:31,478 --> 00:50:32,422
A senior actor!

759
00:50:32,479 --> 00:50:33,253
Hi..

760
00:50:33,313 --> 00:50:34,383
Myself Sharma.

761
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:37,288
OK let's see here.. Nice..

762
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,523
Just a little chest hair..

763
00:50:41,688 --> 00:50:43,133
Nice beard!

764
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:43,964
One minute!

765
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,135
Yes.

766
00:50:49,162 --> 00:50:50,232
Perfect!

767
00:50:52,065 --> 00:50:53,601
Perfect!

768
00:51:02,075 --> 00:51:03,315
Sir..

769
00:51:04,745 --> 00:51:06,486
We are screwed!

770
00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:10,419
Junior!

771
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:11,494
Sir!

772
00:51:11,551 --> 00:51:13,360
How much longer?

773
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,160
Sir, 30 minutes tops!

774
00:51:16,423 --> 00:51:20,701
Why are we talking in sign language?

775
00:51:24,631 --> 00:51:26,338
Give me that thing..

776
00:51:27,567 --> 00:51:29,979
Don't you know this
is a silent chopper?

777
00:51:32,472 --> 00:51:33,507
Now listen Barbie.

778
00:51:33,707 --> 00:51:38,417
I want this clown to look like
Osama in 30 minutes!

779
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:41,355
And you owl eyes.. Write in arabic..

780
00:51:41,448 --> 00:51:45,590
Write that 'l, Osama, am Alive and in
good care of my dear friend Khaleeli'

781
00:51:46,453 --> 00:51:48,592
But I don't know
how to write in Arabic.

782
00:51:52,225 --> 00:51:54,432
Can you write in Arabic?

783
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,633
Yes!

784
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,268
I have proof..

785
00:52:00,333 --> 00:52:03,542
Owl eyes will write Arabic.

786
00:52:04,004 --> 00:52:05,574
Barbie will do his make up..

787
00:52:06,473 --> 00:52:09,181
And you.. Weirdo!
Will mimic Osama's voice..

788
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:12,581
Yes Sir! I am a mimicry artist!

789
00:52:15,115 --> 00:52:18,028
L.. Khaleeli loves Osama!

790
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,966
Please Uncle.. We will do it!

791
00:52:23,123 --> 00:52:25,194
Chirag just write anything!

792
00:53:04,164 --> 00:53:06,041
Mona where is Osama?

793
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:22,382
In America!

794
00:53:22,549 --> 00:53:24,392
It's done!

795
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,630
Is he Osama or Santa Claus?

796
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,505
Disgusting!

797
00:53:39,432 --> 00:53:42,242
You read what you have written!

798
00:53:54,514 --> 00:53:56,687
Osama sounds like a choo choo train!

799
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,155
What kind of Arabic is this?

800
00:53:58,218 --> 00:53:59,390
It's Arabic, Sir..

801
00:53:59,452 --> 00:54:01,227
Weirdo here can't read it..

802
00:54:01,288 --> 00:54:03,529
Rahul please read only Arabic.

803
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:04,568
It's not Arabic!

804
00:54:04,624 --> 00:54:06,433
This ass has written gibberish!

805
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:07,267
It's Arabic!

806
00:54:07,294 --> 00:54:08,568
Don't lie, you have written gibberish.

807
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,075
Shut up!

808
00:54:13,133 --> 00:54:14,271
Daaga. Shoot them all..

809
00:54:14,467 --> 00:54:15,411
Daaga.

810
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,448
Uncle, we are just actors.

811
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,576
Without a Director.. We are clueless!

812
00:54:20,907 --> 00:54:22,113
What is a Director?

813
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,051
Nice..

814
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,246
In fact good..

815
00:54:24,477 --> 00:54:25,979
Good depth.

816
00:54:26,313 --> 00:54:27,348
But what do you wanna shoot here?

817
00:54:27,414 --> 00:54:28,552
You..

818
00:54:29,149 --> 00:54:30,150
Bulla. What are you saying?

819
00:54:30,216 --> 00:54:32,992
It's Khaleeli Sir's order!
Why did you pile on?

820
00:54:33,053 --> 00:54:36,432
I asked you in the van also.
Didn't I?

821
00:54:36,489 --> 00:54:39,333
Go right.
Now go left.. Right. Perfect!

822
00:54:39,426 --> 00:54:41,428
Bulla listen to me..
Let's run away!

823
00:54:41,494 --> 00:54:42,234
Sorry?

824
00:54:42,295 --> 00:54:43,137
Bollywood!

825
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,506
If I can transform
Paddi into 'The Paddi'..

826
00:54:45,598 --> 00:54:47,544
I can make you 'Tha Bulla' in no time!

827
00:54:48,001 --> 00:54:49,105
Bulla.

828
00:54:49,436 --> 00:54:50,642
Bulla stop!

829
00:54:51,137 --> 00:54:52,207
Bulla stop!

830
00:54:57,477 --> 00:54:58,319
Come on!

831
00:54:58,445 --> 00:54:59,617
Khaleeli wants you..

832
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:00,657
Why?

833
00:55:01,247 --> 00:55:04,160
To resurrect Osama!

834
00:55:23,136 --> 00:55:24,240
And cut it!

835
00:55:24,604 --> 00:55:26,049
Here.. Your tape is ready.

836
00:55:26,139 --> 00:55:28,210
Brilliant Sharma!

837
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,550
I can't thank you enough for this..

838
00:55:30,643 --> 00:55:32,418
Come on Khaleeli Sir..

839
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:33,614
I am a Director..

840
00:55:33,947 --> 00:55:35,517
Can't say no to a film..

841
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:38,290
Films run in your family it seems.

842
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:42,563
Can you not get into
my family affairs?

843
00:55:42,655 --> 00:55:44,293
Mind your tape business!

844
00:55:44,491 --> 00:55:46,027
Don't be upset!

845
00:55:46,126 --> 00:55:49,630
Tell me..
What is Osama saying in this tape?

846
00:55:54,334 --> 00:55:55,540
Osama?

847
00:55:57,971 --> 00:55:59,143
Osama said..

848
00:55:59,506 --> 00:56:00,678
'I am Alive'.

849
00:56:01,241 --> 00:56:01,946
And..

850
00:56:02,075 --> 00:56:05,181
'I am with Khaleeli Sir'

851
00:56:05,345 --> 00:56:07,621
He likes you!

852
00:56:08,148 --> 00:56:09,092
And..

853
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:13,563
'I beg for some donations in
the name of almighty'

854
00:56:14,921 --> 00:56:15,956
Right!

855
00:56:19,025 --> 00:56:23,940
OK.. Bulla. No.. Daaga. Check
it once and keep it in the locker.

856
00:56:24,564 --> 00:56:25,907
Khaleeli Sir..

857
00:56:26,399 --> 00:56:29,209
Now that your work is done..

858
00:56:29,369 --> 00:56:30,404
And the tape has also come out well..

859
00:56:32,205 --> 00:56:35,414
I was thinking what
if we leave for India?

860
00:56:35,909 --> 00:56:36,910
Paddi. Come on boy!

861
00:56:37,944 --> 00:56:41,915
Uncle! This time don't
send us tied in sacks.

862
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,291
Fight or train would also do..
Right boys?

863
00:56:45,285 --> 00:56:47,265
Daaga is so cute..

864
00:56:48,121 --> 00:56:51,102
Come on Boys.. Bye Sir!

865
00:56:53,193 --> 00:56:54,570
Sharma!

866
00:56:57,597 --> 00:57:01,374
Come to daddy.. Come to daddy..

867
00:57:04,537 --> 00:57:07,609
Look Sharma, America will definitely
reply to this tape.

868
00:57:07,974 --> 00:57:10,386
Then we'll need to reply
with another tape.

869
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:15,084
Then they will reply..
And we will reply..

870
00:57:15,148 --> 00:57:17,355
This replying game will go on forever!

871
00:57:17,417 --> 00:57:19,363
So now you are our guests.

872
00:57:19,385 --> 00:57:21,456
Pop some opium.

873
00:57:21,621 --> 00:57:23,259
And keep making tapes!

874
00:57:23,623 --> 00:57:25,398
Listen my bearded twin..

875
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:27,070
Spare me!

876
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,631
I will never become Osama again.

877
00:57:29,996 --> 00:57:34,240
I'll go back to my village.
I beg you Khaleeli Sir!

878
00:57:35,168 --> 00:57:39,480
Sir.. Atleast clear my account now!

879
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:42,383
Paddi. Atleast see the situation!

880
00:58:07,267 --> 00:58:08,974
- But it's been three years!
- Buzz off!

881
00:58:09,002 --> 00:58:11,141
You haven't paid me a dime!

882
00:58:24,517 --> 00:58:26,190
Mr. Chadha!

883
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,556
Mr. Chadha!

884
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:31,661
Americans!

885
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,632
Take position and fire!

886
00:58:44,504 --> 00:58:46,108
Till death blows us apart!

887
00:58:56,983 --> 00:58:57,961
Run!

888
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,255
Paddi, run!

889
00:59:01,254 --> 00:59:02,995
Sir!

890
00:59:03,056 --> 00:59:04,091
Mr. David!

891
00:59:04,157 --> 00:59:04,965
Mr. David!

892
00:59:05,024 --> 00:59:05,968
Sir!

893
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:10,137
Mr. David. I knew it!

894
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:11,436
Only Hollywood can save Bollywood!

895
00:59:11,497 --> 00:59:12,601
Thank me later.

896
00:59:13,233 --> 00:59:16,009
But tell me..
What were these morons up to?

897
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:18,947
They forced us to make
a fake tape of Osama!

898
00:59:19,005 --> 00:59:20,211
Bloody idiots!

899
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:21,541

900
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:38,398

A Hollywood producer with US marines?

917
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:30,515

923
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:48,202
Rahul Singh doesn't attend
someone else's shoot!

924
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:51,678
Chadha Uncle.. We just escaped death!

925
01:02:51,735 --> 01:02:53,373
Please send us home!

926
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:55,278
My cat is also alone in the house..

927
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:00,320
OK.. OK.. Guys!

928
01:03:00,644 --> 01:03:02,646
You can also be part of this film!

929
01:03:02,746 --> 01:03:03,622
Really!

930
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:05,382
Sharma!

931
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:06,822
There is no role for them!

932
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:08,922
Mr. David..
They are Bollywood wannabes!

933
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:12,422
For a minute in Hollywood, they
will make noise for one year!

934
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:15,927
Guys! Welcome to Hollywood!

935
01:03:17,661 --> 01:03:20,164
Love struck like a hurricane.

936
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,469
Shook the world and gave it pain.

937
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:23,272
Love struck like..

938
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:25,279
Paddi, careful! Chopper bladesl!

939
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:42,621
What are you staring at?

940
01:03:42,686 --> 01:03:44,495
It's your house! Come!

941
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:47,357
Sharma come!

942
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:49,333
See that!

943
01:03:55,799 --> 01:03:57,437
Be careful of snakes!

944
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:02,544
And. This is it!

945
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:05,982
A wall!

946
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:07,720
Where is Hollywood?

947
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:09,915
Oh.. One minute!

948
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:13,853
Mr. Chadha

949
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:15,287
I'll also drink some water.

950
01:04:15,919 --> 01:04:17,489
I am parched!

951
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:21,558
It's not coming out?!

952
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:56,635
Come on..

953
01:04:57,494 --> 01:05:00,475
Welcome to Somewhere in Somewhere!

954
01:05:00,964 --> 01:05:02,307
WOW!

955
01:05:02,766 --> 01:05:04,336
It looks right out of a Fairy Tale!

956
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:05,710
Isn't it fantastic?!

957
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:09,239
This is our Abottabad set..
Osama's House!

958
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:11,512
What say Mr. Paddi.

959
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:13,278
My Star!

960
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:15,419
Why are you standing?

961
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:16,752
Why don't you sit down.

962
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:19,182
Sharma.

963
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:20,419
Look..

964
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:22,224
Osama's bedroom.

965
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:23,457
Isn't it nice?

966
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:25,291
Very real Mr. David!

967
01:05:25,455 --> 01:05:26,525
Chadha uncle..

968
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:27,861
Very nice..

969
01:05:28,158 --> 01:05:28,932
Thank you!

970
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:31,398
Mr. David. Could we get a script?

971
01:05:31,561 --> 01:05:32,699
Mr. Chirag.

972
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:34,638
There is no script to this film..

973
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,370
Because it's based on real reality!

974
01:05:38,835 --> 01:05:40,178
So Sharma!

975
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:41,306
What was I saying?

976
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:43,706
The scene goes like this.

977
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:45,219
Osama is sleeping in his bedroom.

978
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:46,345
He is sleeping!

979
01:05:46,476 --> 01:05:48,422
Suddenly we see American
chopper approaching.

980
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:49,785
US marines climb out of it.

981
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:51,222
And barge into Osama's bedroom.

982
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:52,521
Bam! Bam! Bam!

983
01:05:52,649 --> 01:05:53,650
Osama's dead!

984
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:58,423
Then they will wrap up his dead body..

985
01:05:58,488 --> 01:05:59,865
They will put him in the chopper..
Fly away.

986
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:01,266
And throw him in the Sea.

987
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,236
Black out.

988
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:04,303
OK.

989
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:05,565
OK, my Ass!

990
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:09,540
What is Rahul Singh's role?

991
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,211
Uncle what is the
motivation of this scene?

992
01:06:13,603 --> 01:06:14,581
Mr. David.

993
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:16,180
Let me..

994
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:17,316
Sugandha.

995
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,283
You will be Osama's wife!

996
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:21,547
Rustic!

997
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:22,620
Very good..

998
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:25,216
Osama can't be alone!

999
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,693
So the two of you..
Will be his bodyguards!

1000
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:30,625
You want ME to be a bodyguard?

1001
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:33,327
No I mean Mujahideen!

1002
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:35,801
You will fight with the US marines!

1003
01:06:35,892 --> 01:06:37,235
That's a brilliant idea, Sir!

1004
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:38,829
They'll all be disposed
off in one shot.

1005
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:40,271
Sharma.

1006
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,739
Am I just sleeping?

1007
01:06:42,866 --> 01:06:44,937
What if him and I have some action?

1008
01:06:45,268 --> 01:06:46,178
Very good!

1009
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:47,476
Where were you all this while..

1010
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:48,345
Mr. David.

1011
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:50,179
Involvement!
Very good idea!

1012
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,413
Before the Marines barge in..

1013
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:56,252
Let's show some romance
between Osama and his wife.

1014
01:06:56,446 --> 01:06:57,789
What say Paddi?

1015
01:06:59,282 --> 01:07:00,454
No Sharma!

1016
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:01,655
I am not making a film!

1017
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:03,923
I mean, it's not that kind of a film!

1018
01:07:04,287 --> 01:07:05,789
Mr. David listen to me..

1019
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,835
Sit down.

1020
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:10,635
Mr. David we will
shoot it aesthetically.

1021
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:11,637
No vulgarity!

1022
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,901
Sex scene for us is
like honey for the bees.

1023
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:16,540
More the sex. Bigger the audience!

1024
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,337
- Really?
- No..

1025
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:19,745
No.. I can't allow..

1026
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:20,803
Chadha uncle!

1027
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,315
Sorry to cut your off..

1028
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:23,676
I wanna do..

1029
01:07:23,907 --> 01:07:24,817
Do?

1030
01:07:25,275 --> 01:07:25,810
Do what?

1031
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,548
Mr. David imagine!

1032
01:07:27,744 --> 01:07:29,280
It's raining outside.

1033
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:30,380
Thunder!

1034
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:33,484
Cut to! The American chopper
is approaching the target.

1035
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:35,655
It is a silent chopper..

1036
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,459
Silent? No problem.

1037
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:39,194
Cut to!

1038
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:41,701
Two Mujahideen are
guarding the house..

1039
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:44,534
Everybody Stay Alert!

1040
01:07:44,694 --> 01:07:48,164
Everybody Stay Alert!

1041
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:49,238
Echo effect!

1042
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:51,677
Cut to! Osama is walking in his room..

1043
01:07:51,868 --> 01:07:53,779
He is restless.. Sleep deprived.

1044
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:55,713
He is very lonely within..

1045
01:07:58,308 --> 01:07:59,286
Lonely effect!

1046
01:07:59,342 --> 01:08:00,343
He wants something.

1047
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:07,555
Then suddenly his newly wedded wife
walks in with a glass of milk..

1048
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:14,864
Osama sees her and utters.

1049
01:08:15,158 --> 01:08:15,761
I love Milk!

1050
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:18,704
Paddi. Please. Don't disturb!

1051
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:22,166
Osama whispers to his wife..
'Sugarcrush.

1052
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:24,309
'I have a very empty feeling inside,
please fill me up'..

1053
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:24,868
Cut to..

1054
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:27,705
US marines are loading their guns..

1055
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,243
Cut back!

1056
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:33,412
Osama's wife embraces him..

1057
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:36,716
And kisses his forehead.

1058
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:37,590
Cut back!

1059
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:39,752
The American chopper enters the house!

1060
01:08:39,816 --> 01:08:42,228
Mujahideen start firing at them!

1061
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:43,931
Gun fight! Mr. David. Gun fight!

1062
01:08:44,187 --> 01:08:48,260
Inside it is Valentine's!
And outside.. Halloween!

1063
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:54,773
Just then! The Marines barge into
Osama's bedroom.

1064
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:57,675
BAM!
BAM! BAM!

1065
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:03,740
In a matter of seconds..
Osama's wife is a WIDOW!

1066
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:05,616
- Widow!
- Black out!

1067
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,288
Brilliant!

1068
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:18,832
Make it Sharma. Make it!

1069
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:20,130
Oscar shot!

1070
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:21,797
Oscar shot By God!

1071
01:09:22,392 --> 01:09:23,302
What a director.

1072
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:24,463
What a director!

1073
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:25,537
But sir..

1074
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:27,801
Junior, get the shot ready.

1075
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:29,608
And I'll have a hot dog..

1076
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,841
You swine! What is he saying?

1077
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:40,616
Khaleeli Sir, he said..

1078
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:42,654
Harkat-E-Mansha is an army of Donkeys!

1079
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:44,156
Sick bastards!

1080
01:09:44,714 --> 01:09:45,749
Hold it Daaga!

1081
01:09:45,815 --> 01:09:47,726
To fight the Americans.

1082
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,160
We need help from these Afghans.

1083
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:55,327
Bulla. Tell these guys that Osama is
alive and we know where to find him..

1084
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:10,181
Sir, he just ordered death upon us
for making fun of Osama!

1085
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:35,732
Khaleeli Sir..

1086
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:37,867
They have agreed
to fight the Americans.

1087
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:39,880
But under one condition.

1088
01:10:40,636 --> 01:10:41,910
Daaga has to be left behind!

1089
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,876
They believe that a person
without a mustache or a beard

1090
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:45,619
cannot be a mujahideen!

1091
01:10:47,143 --> 01:10:50,420
Lights. Camera. Rain!

1092
01:10:52,515 --> 01:10:54,722
Sir, it wasn't raining
when we killed Osama.

1093
01:10:55,852 --> 01:10:57,422
It's Cinematic Liberty!

1094
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:00,567
But we're not making a movie..

1095
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:03,804
And action!

1096
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:06,702
This burning thing is called fire..

1097
01:11:07,163 --> 01:11:09,302
Come on boys.. Give me a perfect shot!

1098
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:15,409
And once it's out. It will be ash.
How intriguing!!

1099
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:18,776
Abu Baker! Helicopter!

1100
01:11:18,908 --> 01:11:24,187
We will not die today! 'Cause today
is our Independence Day!

1101
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:26,758
Hare Krishna! Save me!

1102
01:11:26,816 --> 01:11:28,193
Cut it!

1103
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:29,489
Chirag?

1104
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,357
What the hell are you doing, Chirag?

1105
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:33,331
What happened?

1106
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:35,801
Why are you shouting
as if someone is raping you?

1107
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:36,599
Take the chopper back.

1108
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:38,229
What happened Sir?

1109
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:40,738
Sharma. This gun is real!

1110
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:42,774
One bullet nicked my ear..

1111
01:11:42,832 --> 01:11:43,640
It's red!

1112
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:45,975
Chirag, everything is fake here!

1113
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:47,305
Wait, I am coming!

1114
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:48,474
Come fast!

1115
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:51,376
Here I come!

1116
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:01,327
Chirag. You are one big pussy!

1117
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:03,361
This gun is all plastic.

1118
01:12:03,419 --> 01:12:04,762
Watch this!

1119
01:12:04,854 --> 01:12:06,265
Nothing happened!

1120
01:12:10,293 --> 01:12:11,897
See.. Nothing happened!

1121
01:12:12,295 --> 01:12:13,365
What happened?

1122
01:12:13,896 --> 01:12:14,738
Bob..

1123
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:19,169
Sgt. Bob..

1124
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,274
Come on Sgt. Bob!

1125
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:24,178
Enough with the jokes.

1126
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,846
Now get up and show everybody
that you are OK!

1127
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,459
He scared the hell out of us.

1128
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:41,225
Good actor..

1129
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:42,462
Back to positions now!

1130
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:44,801
Sharma. ls my make up OK?

1131
01:12:44,894 --> 01:12:46,396
Yeah it's OK..

1132
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:48,408
Chirag, happy'?

1133
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:49,966
Back to positions!

1134
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:56,278
Hare Krishna!

1135
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:02,749
And Action!

1136
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:04,549
Come on boys, let's go for it..

1137
01:13:05,648 --> 01:13:07,992
Abu Baker! Helicopter!

1138
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:13,926
Come on American dogs!

1139
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:17,669
I'll kill everyone of you and
bury you in Afghanistan!

1140
01:13:19,662 --> 01:13:22,939
- Cut it!
- I'll kill everyone of you..

1141
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:25,608
- Cut it!
- To hell with you..

1142
01:13:25,668 --> 01:13:28,308
I said.. Cut!!

1143
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:31,810
What?

1144
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:33,182
Cut it! God damn it!

1145
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:34,414
What happened?

1146
01:13:34,477 --> 01:13:35,785
I was so absorbed in the shot.

1147
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:37,653
Absorbed, my ass!

1148
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:38,919
What happened, Sir?

1149
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:40,626
Sir, we're wasting time.

1150
01:13:40,683 --> 01:13:42,458
Thanks for that
ridiculous performance.

1151
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:45,294
You look like a chimp..
Stop acting like one!

1152
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:51,238
Pack up!
Pack up!

1153
01:13:51,394 --> 01:13:52,702
Sugandha baby..
Is it the dinner break?

1154
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:55,504
- What do you mean by pack up?
- Sharma what's wrong?

1155
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,477
Mr. David pack him off!

1156
01:13:58,301 --> 01:14:00,679
I'll make Chirag do the action scene!

1157
01:14:00,736 --> 01:14:02,841
Go fight like Chuck Norris!

1158
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:05,811
Sharma. Wait!
Let me speak to RahuL.

1159
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:09,688
Sir, is it a pack up or not?

1160
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:11,324
Paddi. Keep shut for a while!

1161
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:12,617
Sharma.

1162
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:16,556
Sharma.
We are wasting a lot of time.

1163
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:17,890
Why don't we kill Paddi first?

1164
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:21,264
I mean.
Shoot the Osama killing first!

1165
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,333
Good idea.

1166
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:23,461
Location change.

1167
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:25,232
Let's do the bedroom scene first!

1168
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,441
Our love scene is next, handsome!

1169
01:14:29,265 --> 01:14:30,710
Daaga. My DOV!

1170
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:32,575
Please don't cry..

1171
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:36,249
I am gifting you my suicide jacket.

1172
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:39,952
If you ever miss me..
Say my name and..

1173
01:14:42,445 --> 01:14:43,549
Have a blast!

1174
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:58,397
As soon as you enter, kill Paddi the
same way that was told to the media.

1175
01:14:58,561 --> 01:15:00,734
One on the chest. One on the head!

1176
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,403
All set, Sir!

1177
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:10,213
Ready everybody.. And.. Action!

1178
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:32,434
Cut it.

1179
01:15:32,495 --> 01:15:33,838
Paddi come on..

1180
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:34,897
One more..

1181
01:15:35,164 --> 01:15:36,302
Take 8!

1182
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:38,268
And Action!

1183
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:42,281
I love Milk!

1184
01:15:42,338 --> 01:15:43,908
No No..
Cut it!

1185
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:46,308
Paddi come on.. Emotions!

1186
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,410
OK.. Ready.

1187
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:48,849
Take 21!

1188
01:15:49,779 --> 01:15:50,553
Action!

1189
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:51,624
Action!

1190
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:55,259
I love Milk!

1191
01:15:55,418 --> 01:15:56,362
Cut it!

1192
01:15:56,519 --> 01:15:58,192
Hollywood.. Feel it!

1193
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:00,264
Action!

1194
01:16:04,427 --> 01:16:05,701
Very good!

1195
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:09,305
- I love Milk!
- Cut it!

1196
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:14,542
Take 69..

1197
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:16,476
Action!

1198
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:18,743
Sharma. Get it right this time!

1199
01:16:31,487 --> 01:16:32,932
Osama.

1200
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:37,670
Cut it!

1201
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:38,729
What happened?

1202
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:40,464
One more Paddi.

1203
01:16:40,663 --> 01:16:42,643
What one more!

1204
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:48,643
What the.
I love Milk! I love Milk! I love Milk!

1205
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:52,576
Why don't you bloody die!

1206
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:56,350
Why are you driving me crazy..
You sick bastard!

1207
01:16:56,512 --> 01:16:57,752
Who made you an actor?

1208
01:16:57,813 --> 01:17:01,351
I wanna put this gun in your mouth
and blast your brains out!

1209
01:17:01,417 --> 01:17:04,296
Pack up.. Pack up..

1210
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:05,629
Buzz off!

1211
01:17:06,322 --> 01:17:08,802
How dare you!
Why did you shout at my star?

1212
01:17:08,858 --> 01:17:10,337
Screw Hollywood!

1213
01:17:10,392 --> 01:17:12,338
And who do you think you're
scaring with a toy gun?

1214
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:13,372
Should I shoot you?!

1215
01:17:13,429 --> 01:17:16,433
Sharma. Please return my gun..

1216
01:17:16,499 --> 01:17:17,910
I got emotional.

1217
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:19,903
But he is not dying!

1218
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,138
We can't shoot now..

1219
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:23,512
But why?

1220
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:25,443
Mr. David.

1221
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:28,186
Sugandha's aggression has already
made him wet his pants.

1222
01:17:28,244 --> 01:17:32,192
And you shoved death in his mouth!
Let him catch his breath!

1223
01:17:33,916 --> 01:17:35,418
We need to relieve his tension!

1224
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:36,657
Don't worry Sharma.

1225
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:38,460
I will ease him out!

1226
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:43,736
Mr. David that's what I call
involvement.

1227
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:44,934
Mr. David.

1228
01:17:45,194 --> 01:17:46,229
In the meantime.

1229
01:17:46,929 --> 01:17:49,409
Let's call for a break!

1230
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:51,310
I will have a hot dog!

1231
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:55,713
What?

1232
01:17:57,606 --> 01:17:58,846
So Paddi.

1233
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:00,820
How do you wanna do this?

1234
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:02,551
Sugandha Baby.

1235
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:03,679
Bushes!

1236
01:18:03,913 --> 01:18:04,823
In the village.

1237
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,486
That's where boys pop their cherry!

1238
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:09,286
So earthy.

1239
01:18:09,485 --> 01:18:10,964
Interesting. Come on..

1240
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:12,764
Come!

1241
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:15,667
Bro.. This is Hollywood!

1242
01:18:15,758 --> 01:18:17,203
I don't need 5 pounds of acting.

1243
01:18:17,226 --> 01:18:19,228
5 ounces will do..
Keep it subtle.

1244
01:18:19,562 --> 01:18:20,597
5 ounces?

1245
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:22,675
I'm an actor. Not a piece of meat!

1246
01:18:23,232 --> 01:18:25,143
And keep your attitude in check.

1247
01:18:25,601 --> 01:18:29,174
After all Rahul Singh
is the star of your film!

1248
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:29,908
Of course!

1249
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:31,173
Give me a high five..

1250
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:32,743
RahuL. Sharma.

1251
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:34,515
What?

1252
01:18:35,144 --> 01:18:36,714
There is no craft service!

1253
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:37,517
So?

1254
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:38,923
But Sharma.

1255
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:42,662
Be it Hollywood or Bollywood..
Break implies Craft Service!

1256
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:45,356
Something is not right.

1257
01:18:45,621 --> 01:18:46,599
Give it a thought.

1258
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:48,498
There is no script nor a crew..

1259
01:18:48,624 --> 01:18:51,662
Only that Ape David Chadha,
and his Marines!

1260
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,229
What do you make of all this?

1261
01:19:12,181 --> 01:19:12,852
Oh yes.. It is!

1262
01:19:45,748 --> 01:19:46,783
Paddi.

1263
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:48,418
Now don't be shy!

1264
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:51,657
It's just my first
time so..

1265
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:53,360
Let's make it mechanical.

1266
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:55,592
You close your eyes..

1267
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:59,261
Walk towards me.. And just kiss me!

1268
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:01,374
That sounds good!

1269
01:20:01,664 --> 01:20:04,270
So here I come Sugandha Baby.

1270
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:05,778
Yes. Paddi come..

1271
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:07,279
Come to me!

1272
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:09,311
I'm coming Sugandha Baby!

1273
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:14,115
I am coming.. Sugandha Baby!

1274
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:15,787
Come Paddi come!

1275
01:20:16,211 --> 01:20:17,451
Say my name!

1276
01:20:38,434 --> 01:20:39,811
Sugandha Baby.

1277
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:41,512
You are freezing!

1278
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:45,584
The cold has made you so stiff!

1279
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:50,619
Sugandha baby..

1280
01:20:50,713 --> 01:20:52,317
I finally feel like a Man!

1281
01:20:52,381 --> 01:20:53,485
Paddi.

1282
01:20:54,283 --> 01:20:55,523
That's a man!

1283
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:11,572
Sir! Sir!

1284
01:21:21,777 --> 01:21:23,814
Can you stop crying like a girl?!

1285
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:24,914
Let me think.

1286
01:21:24,947 --> 01:21:28,224
I said it in the chopper..
Let's go back to India!

1287
01:21:28,283 --> 01:21:29,887
But all of you laughed at me!

1288
01:21:29,952 --> 01:21:32,728
I am amazed,
we weren't suspicious at all!

1289
01:21:32,788 --> 01:21:34,927
How were we fooled so easily?

1290
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:36,794
We were not fooled.. But tricked.

1291
01:21:36,859 --> 01:21:37,894
By this Sharma!

1292
01:21:38,327 --> 01:21:40,364
He lured us into this Hollywood trap!

1293
01:21:40,429 --> 01:21:41,635
Why are you blaming me?

1294
01:21:41,697 --> 01:21:43,335
I have been tricked by Paddi!

1295
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:44,400
What?

1296
01:21:45,334 --> 01:21:46,404
I tricked you?

1297
01:21:46,468 --> 01:21:47,742
Who else!

1298
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:50,544
I was innocently making
coffee in the kitchen,

1299
01:21:50,672 --> 01:21:52,913
he selfishly tricked
me into Hollywood..

1300
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:54,482
I wasn't even interested!

1301
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:55,919
What the hell are you saying.

1302
01:21:56,712 --> 01:21:57,713
Uh.. Sir!

1303
01:21:57,813 --> 01:21:59,486
Who made me Osama?

1304
01:21:59,548 --> 01:22:00,788
Who sold my farms?

1305
01:22:00,883 --> 01:22:02,920
Who made me a method actor?

1306
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:05,821
Who cooked up the myth of 'Paddi,
The Star'?

1307
01:22:05,888 --> 01:22:10,894
It's my fault that I tried to
make a star out of a country bumpkin!

1308
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,600
Really!

1309
01:22:12,728 --> 01:22:15,470
As if you are the heir
to the British Throne!

1310
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:17,374
'Sweet - Maker Sharma!'

1311
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:18,944
Have you forgotten.

1312
01:22:19,201 --> 01:22:22,205
The sweat drenching
experience of sweet making!

1313
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:27,811
Sharma senior still sells Churros.
Crooning Ten Bucks for Two!

1314
01:22:29,545 --> 01:22:31,957
Ten bucks for two!

1315
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:35,292
What?

1316
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:37,296
Now Churro makers
are becoming film makers!

1317
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:39,356
Hare Krishna!

1318
01:22:56,271 --> 01:22:57,341
Hello friends!

1319
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:03,815
We have to shoot immediately.

1320
01:23:05,581 --> 01:23:07,254
Where is Sharma?

1321
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:20,672
Sir?!

1322
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:25,841
Sir? You are frying Churros?

1323
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:30,715
Guys! Give me some
alone time with my buddy.

1324
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:33,651
Paddi.

1325
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:37,256
These are not just Churros.

1326
01:23:37,613 --> 01:23:39,354
This is my inborn talent!

1327
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:41,857
A talent I never appreciated!

1328
01:23:42,251 --> 01:23:44,788
But today, after you blurted it out.

1329
01:23:44,887 --> 01:23:47,265
I have finally made
peace with my reality!

1330
01:23:47,456 --> 01:23:48,833
Now you watch!

1331
01:23:48,891 --> 01:23:52,634
Before I die, I'll make
such amazing Churros.

1332
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:54,671
That people will forget my film!

1333
01:23:56,331 --> 01:23:57,275
Sir..

1334
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,339
Please forgive me..

1335
01:24:00,836 --> 01:24:03,442
I have made a grave mistake!

1336
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:09,388
I have screwed up my mentor!
And driven him crazy!

1337
01:24:10,512 --> 01:24:11,582
Paddi!

1338
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,487
Don't feel bad..

1339
01:24:13,549 --> 01:24:16,530
Here.. I will not let you die hungry!

1340
01:24:16,585 --> 01:24:18,929
Sir.. I have lost my appetite!

1341
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:23,825
Sir, it's delicious.
What's the ingredient?

1342
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:25,599
Paddi, emotion.

1343
01:24:26,662 --> 01:24:29,541
Sir, they are ready to shoot now..

1344
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:31,302
The moment you say Action.

1345
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:33,471
First these scumbags
will terminate me..

1346
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:34,639
And then you!

1347
01:24:34,937 --> 01:24:38,248
I don't wanna get massacred by them..

1348
01:24:38,373 --> 01:24:40,649
I'd rather have you kill me!

1349
01:24:40,943 --> 01:24:45,619
Right Sir! You shoot me!
I beg of you.. Shoot me!

1350
01:24:46,949 --> 01:24:47,950
Paddi!

1351
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:49,591
That's a brilliant idea!

1352
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:51,426
You've saved all of us!

1353
01:24:51,653 --> 01:24:52,825
Wow Sharma!

1354
01:24:53,322 --> 01:24:55,302
These are amazing!

1355
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:56,731
By the way..

1356
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:59,199
What were you saying that
the Marines don't work?

1357
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:03,300
Mr. David, these American
actors are very realistic.

1358
01:25:03,365 --> 01:25:04,901
And Bollywood actors are melodramatic!

1359
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:06,708
It's a terrible combination.

1360
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:09,214
It's like eating Chicken
Burger with Chicken Curry!

1361
01:25:09,237 --> 01:25:11,513
That's why the shoot is suffering..

1362
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:14,712
Look at them. Such realistic
emotions.. Very innocent!

1363
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:15,652
Very real!

1364
01:25:15,711 --> 01:25:17,622
And look at them. Fake!

1365
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:19,818
But what's the point?

1366
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:21,456
Trust me..

1367
01:25:21,817 --> 01:25:23,728
Let us Indians play the
Marines.

1368
01:25:23,919 --> 01:25:26,263
It will balance it out!

1369
01:25:27,422 --> 01:25:28,332
Meaning?

1370
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:30,301
Chirag, Rahul and l..

1371
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:32,768
Will dress up like Marines and
enter Osama's room..

1372
01:25:32,828 --> 01:25:33,932
They will shoot!

1373
01:25:34,196 --> 01:25:37,234
While I candidly
capture Osama's death.

1374
01:25:37,299 --> 01:25:38,471
Guerilla style!

1375
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:40,543
Sharma! These Marines are Americans!

1376
01:25:40,769 --> 01:25:43,613
Not to sound racist but.
Your colours won't match.

1377
01:25:43,739 --> 01:25:46,219
Oh c'mon Mr. David!
The Marines are wearing helmets.

1378
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:47,810
You can barely see their faces...

1379
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:53,189
As it is, if you decide to swap
Sgt. Bob with Sgt. Jack.

1380
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:56,818
There's no way we'd know, right?

1381
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:58,864
No.. No.. Of course not!

1382
01:25:59,755 --> 01:26:02,827
Should I take this shot?
One take and Osama dead!

1383
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:04,530
Alright!
" No!"

1384
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:06,831
No.. Oh no.. I can't
allow!

1385
01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:07,930
One take. One take.

1386
01:26:08,230 --> 01:26:09,834
He'll be done in one take.

1387
01:26:10,632 --> 01:26:13,340
Mr. David! Gulp it
down and let's just do it!

1388
01:26:13,802 --> 01:26:15,304
OK! Take your shot!

1389
01:26:16,538 --> 01:26:18,381
Junior.
I need the uniforms..

1390
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:20,146
Strip the Marines!

1391
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:28,760
Junior! Once we get the shot.
Dispose them all!

1392
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:30,690
That was the plan!

1393
01:26:32,487 --> 01:26:34,160
And.. Action!

1394
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:39,231
Listen my Starsky and Hutch!
Spray the bullets on the wall..

1395
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:43,572
Don't make their plan a success
by shooting Paddi!

1396
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:45,403
Chill!

1397
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:52,684
Relax Paddi! All will be good!

1398
01:26:52,741 --> 01:26:54,186
Sugandha baby..

1399
01:26:54,276 --> 01:26:56,517
I'm really scared
of Rahul and Chirag.

1400
01:26:56,611 --> 01:27:00,491
Their overacting
will definitely kill me!

1401
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:02,455
Sugandha baby?

1402
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:04,894
I love your rustic charm!

1403
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:14,138
Paddi. Die!

1404
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:17,399
Sucker is dead!

1405
01:27:17,566 --> 01:27:19,341
Stop overacting Sugandha.

1406
01:27:25,674 --> 01:27:28,382
He is Dead. He is Dead.
Osama is finally dead!

1407
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:36,360
Sir!

1408
01:27:38,186 --> 01:27:38,926
Sir!

1409
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:40,666
There's no blood on Osama!

1410
01:27:42,224 --> 01:27:43,669
See.. No blood!

1411
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:44,803
Never mind!

1412
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:47,340
We will just take a separate
shot of the dead body..

1413
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:48,904
Come on.. Call the chopper back.

1414
01:27:49,331 --> 01:27:50,708
Give me some Churros!

1415
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:55,339
Base to Mute. Return with feedback!
I repeat.. Return with feedback.

1416
01:27:55,403 --> 01:27:57,883
Hey Junior! I'll have a hot dog.

1417
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,510
What?

1418
01:27:59,674 --> 01:28:01,585
Put David on the line please.

1419
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:04,622
Sir! Sharma!

1420
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:06,682
- Sharma?
- Yes!

1421
01:28:07,883 --> 01:28:08,554
Yes Sharma?

1422
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:12,861
Mr. David focus! Your Osama
flew over the CUCKOO'S nest!

1423
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:15,696
Screw you hairball!

1424
01:28:15,824 --> 01:28:19,362
We are off to India. While you
suck on those Churros!

1425
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:24,875
You son of a bitch!
Screw you on a bed of nails!

1426
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:26,811
What happened? Speak up you Asswipe!

1427
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:28,677
Paddi. It got disconnected!

1428
01:28:28,737 --> 01:28:31,377
Call him back.
I wanna abuse Junior now!

1429
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:33,548
Junior! Get the chopper out. Fast!

1430
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:01,281
Khaleeli Sir.. Helicopter!

1431
01:29:20,422 --> 01:29:21,560
Paddi. ls your face alright?

1432
01:29:21,623 --> 01:29:23,227
Sir.. My hand!

1433
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:26,795
I don't care even if you lose your
hand. Just take care of your face!

1434
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,204
Paddi. Hands up!

1435
01:29:37,806 --> 01:29:39,649
Sheikh Osama!

1436
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:45,585
What's going on?

1437
01:29:47,616 --> 01:29:48,890
Welcome my clown!

1438
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:51,625
Listen to me, you clown!

1439
01:29:51,686 --> 01:29:53,723
Everyone here thinks
you are the real Osama.

1440
01:29:53,922 --> 01:29:56,334
And if they find out
you are an imposter.

1441
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:59,266
They will cut you into pieces!

1442
01:29:59,661 --> 01:30:02,335
So come to daddy..

1443
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:04,699
Come to daddy!

1444
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:07,945
Paddi, don't go!

1445
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:18,589
Paddi!

1446
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:19,824
Paddi!

1447
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:20,689
Paddi!

1448
01:30:20,749 --> 01:30:22,126
What are you doing?

1449
01:30:47,309 --> 01:30:49,721
No.. No.. He is an imposter.

1450
01:30:50,378 --> 01:30:57,762
Bulla, you swine!
Tell them that he is an imposter!

1451
01:31:05,193 --> 01:31:06,297
My Star!

1452
01:31:06,828 --> 01:31:08,466
So absorbed in his character!

1453
01:31:25,547 --> 01:31:28,255
Listen to me you imbeciles!

1454
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:31,297
It is a sin to kill
a fellow Mujahideen.

1455
01:31:48,236 --> 01:31:49,715
Paddi! Duck!

1456
01:31:59,381 --> 01:32:00,826
Paddi!

1457
01:32:04,252 --> 01:32:05,356
Paddi! Duck!

1458
01:32:43,658 --> 01:32:45,467
Hey Paddi!

1459
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:48,605
Come here!

1460
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:51,904
Come to me!

1461
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:56,849
Osama. is MINE!

1462
01:33:32,907 --> 01:33:34,250
Stop!

1463
01:33:34,476 --> 01:33:36,786
Don't move!
Or I will blow my brains out!

1464
01:33:36,845 --> 01:33:39,519
No.. Not the face!

1465
01:33:39,581 --> 01:33:41,185
I need Osama alive!

1466
01:33:41,249 --> 01:33:42,819
Take it up and shoot!

1467
01:33:43,551 --> 01:33:44,655
Pull the trigger!

1468
01:33:44,686 --> 01:33:45,858
- No.. Ignore him!
- Pull!

1469
01:33:45,954 --> 01:33:46,659
NO!

1470
01:33:46,688 --> 01:33:47,723
- Pull!
- NO!

1471
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:48,665
- Pull!
- NO!

1472
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:49,895
Shut up you asswipe!

1473
01:33:50,191 --> 01:33:51,829
I will be Osama no more!

1474
01:33:51,893 --> 01:33:53,497
Paddi. Stop!

1475
01:33:53,595 --> 01:33:55,836
Look here! I'm clearing your accounts!

1476
01:33:56,664 --> 01:33:57,608
For real?

1477
01:33:57,665 --> 01:33:58,575
Yes. Here!

1478
01:33:58,633 --> 01:34:01,807
I am coming.. Wait!

1479
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:05,284
Here is the first installment.
Give me the gun!

1480
01:34:06,708 --> 01:34:08,585
I will smack you! Why did you shoot?

1481
01:34:08,676 --> 01:34:09,916
I didn't shoot!

1482
01:34:13,748 --> 01:34:15,625
- Hare Krishna!
- Mr. President!

1483
01:34:42,911 --> 01:34:43,787
Yes Sir!

1484
01:34:53,588 --> 01:34:54,589
He missed me!

1485
01:34:57,225 --> 01:34:58,295
Bit embarrassing, Sir!

1486
01:34:58,426 --> 01:35:00,906
Shit happens! Here, try once more!

1487
01:35:00,962 --> 01:35:03,670
Paddi stop. Let me handle this!

1488
01:35:03,898 --> 01:35:05,502
Mr. David! Khaleeli Sir!

1489
01:35:10,305 --> 01:35:12,251
All of us want Paddi!

1490
01:35:12,674 --> 01:35:14,176
But that is not possible!

1491
01:35:14,242 --> 01:35:15,346
Says who?

1492
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:16,912
I mean, let's compromise!

1493
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,184
Khaleeli Sir.. What do you want?

1494
01:35:20,315 --> 01:35:22,852
We need.. Donation!

1495
01:35:23,318 --> 01:35:24,353
How much donation?

1496
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:25,792
Five.. Hundred..

1497
01:35:25,853 --> 01:35:26,661
Thousand.

1498
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:27,893
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars!

1499
01:35:28,156 --> 01:35:28,896
Done? Sure?

1500
01:35:29,157 --> 01:35:30,158
Sure!

1501
01:35:30,225 --> 01:35:32,171
Mr. David. Write a cheque..

1502
01:35:32,327 --> 01:35:33,897
That's the only way to get rid of him!

1503
01:35:38,933 --> 01:35:42,176
If you ever need a suicide bomber..

1504
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:43,181
Do remember me!

1505
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:44,342
This is my card!

1506
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:47,409
Khaleeli Baser Wasiqi!
We don't have any branches!

1507
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:53,388
Mr. David.
Why do you want to kill Paddi?

1508
01:35:53,615 --> 01:35:54,923
What's your deal?

1509
01:36:04,492 --> 01:36:05,869
I have an idea!

1510
01:36:07,195 --> 01:36:09,732
I'll get you a proof..

1511
01:36:10,198 --> 01:36:11,643
I'll get you a proof..

1512
01:36:11,899 --> 01:36:14,209
That'll make your President
an overnight sensation!

1513
01:36:27,815 --> 01:36:28,725
Yes we can!

1514
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:29,557
Yes we can!

1515
01:36:29,617 --> 01:36:30,789
And. Cut it!

1516
01:36:31,252 --> 01:36:33,163
Here you go David.
Your proof is ready.

1517
01:36:33,221 --> 01:36:33,926
Very good!

1518
01:36:40,895 --> 01:36:42,875
One simple demand Mr. President.

1519
01:36:43,765 --> 01:36:45,176
One Hollywood film!

1520
01:36:48,703 --> 01:36:50,307
Breaking News!

1521
01:36:50,505 --> 01:36:55,352
White house has finally released
the tape of the Osama killing!

1522
01:36:55,610 --> 01:36:58,591
America wanted their proof, and
America got their proof..

1523
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:01,627
I took out Osama Bin Laden myself,
with my own hands.

1524
01:37:01,783 --> 01:37:04,923
I'm a brave leader and that's why
I'm your President!

1525
01:37:05,453 --> 01:37:07,399
That's why you gave me a second term.

1526
01:37:07,422 --> 01:37:09,197
And that's why this is a sequel!

1527
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:12,567
Now, a renowned Hollywood
producer has announced.

1528
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:14,831
That he will make a
film based on this story!

1529
01:37:15,196 --> 01:37:17,642
The name of the film
is Tora Bora Nights!

1530
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:31,319
Sir.. Shall we?

1531
01:37:49,297 --> 01:37:51,470
Can you tell us more about the
actor in your movie?

1532
01:37:52,533 --> 01:37:54,672
He is not an actor. He is a STAR!

1533
01:37:55,636 --> 01:37:58,412
You can only see my eyes in the film..

1534
01:37:58,473 --> 01:37:59,816
But I'm a trained actor.

1535
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:09,428
For every second...
One expression, you know!

1536
01:38:10,218 --> 01:38:12,562
I am playing an extra in this film!

1537
01:38:13,287 --> 01:38:14,595
It's a 10 second role!

1538
01:38:14,856 --> 01:38:16,335
A blink and a miss!

1539
01:38:17,425 --> 01:38:19,905
It's a sequel for
me to be Osama's voice!

1540
01:38:20,461 --> 01:38:24,466
And the world knows that only
Rahul Singh can do it!

1541
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:29,177
Tora Bora Nights!
It's a family entertainer!

1542
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:31,877
Is there any song and dance?

1543
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:33,745
Song and Dance?

1544
01:38:34,175 --> 01:38:38,920
No.. It's a Hollywood film..
No vulgarity!

1545
01:38:39,347 --> 01:38:40,325
I can't allow!

1546
01:41:48,869 --> 01:41:50,371
Khaleeli Sir!

1547
01:41:50,571 --> 01:41:52,482
Daaga. I got it!

1548
01:41:53,507 --> 01:41:55,282
I got the money, Daaga!

1549
01:41:55,309 --> 01:41:56,549
Now we will attain Heaven!

1550
01:41:58,346 --> 01:41:59,586
Uh.. Oh!

1551
01:42:01,749 --> 01:42:03,228
I am just gonna conclude this.

1552
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:07,422
By quoting,
verse 4, chapter 5 of Dangerous.

1553
01:42:07,989 --> 01:42:12,335
By Saint Michael Jackson!

1554
01:42:13,361 --> 01:42:17,207
That it don't matter
if you are black or white..

1555
01:42:17,732 --> 01:42:19,769
Or for that matter, even brown..

1556
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:20,938
OK.. Let's go!
