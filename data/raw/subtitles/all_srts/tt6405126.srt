1
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
Look at poor Mike.

2
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,200
How he's looking at you
like a lovesick puppy.

3
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,040
Poor Mike, he didn't even survive
your one-year relationship curse.

4
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,500
Six months.

5
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,210
Tell me something,
what's going on with your apartment?

6
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,160
My loan is almost approved.

7
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,750
I'm going there today.

8
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,870
Leaving early.
- Where is it?

9
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,540
It's in Duluth,
near the Italian hotel Fredrico's.

10
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,460
It must have cost you a bomb.

11
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,870
700,000 dollars
is market cost.

12
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,790
But I'm getting it
for 400,000.

13
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,040
How?
- Minority housing.

14
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,500
Praful, you are one
hundred percent Gujarati!

15
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,460
Hello! I've worked hard for it,
for seven years.

16
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,870
And you don't have any kids.

17
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,120
I have parents!

18
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,540
Why isn't 503 cleaned?

19
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,290
503 had a 'Do Not Disturb' board.

20
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,120
No worries.

21
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,120
Just telling that you that they
called and I had Thelma clean it up.

22
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,080
No... we were having lunch,
they must have removed the board.

23
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:24,950
Sorry.

24
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,350
Well then,
why don't I just join you guys...

25
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,800
Who is calling me?

26
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,710
Have a nice lunch, ladies.
- Thank you.

27
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,750
Praful!

28
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,790
Paradise awaits me

29
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,500
And beckons
With open arms

30
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,130
Dear Life

31
00:03:53,210 --> 00:04:00,330
Now break the shackles
and live a little...

32
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,780
Dear Life

33
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,370
Very nice, eh?

34
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,080
Yeah?

35
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,250
There's lots of sunlight
coming in through that window there.

36
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,580
And there's a park out front.

37
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,960
So, no chance of a building
popping up, blocking your view.

38
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,000
And there's an Indian
temple right around the block.

39
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,060
Indian temple?

40
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh... That is a Gurudwara.

41
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,250
We are Hindus.

42
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,460
That is for Sikhs.

43
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,330
Oh okay.

44
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,860
Oh, there's an Indian
Kebab place two blocks away.

45
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,460
But I am a vegetarian.

46
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,080
Oh. Okay.
Vegetarian!

47
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,460
Right! Well...

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,580
You know what,
let me help you with that.

49
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,960
It's kinda tricky.

50
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,710
You gotta have the magic touch.

51
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,790
There you go.
- Thank you.

52
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,750
You're welcome.
And I'll see you outside.

53
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:52,020
Break the shackles and fly away...

54
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:58,330
Spread your wings and fly away...

55
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:04,190
Break the shackles and fly away...

56
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:11,520
Spread your wings and fly away...

57
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:28,130
Break the shackles and fly away...

58
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,210
This apartment is a steal, Ms. Patel.

59
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,710
Just yesterday,
we sold a place for 800,000 dollars.

60
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,160
I know. My...

61
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,750
My mortgage should
come through by next week.

62
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,790
Okay, great.

63
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,460
So I'll draw up the paperwork and how
about we meet in my office on Monday?

64
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,750
Yes.
- Okay.

65
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,770
Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. Steven.

66
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,980
Have a good day.

67
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,890
Hello... Hello, Ms. Julie.
- Hi.

68
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,560
I'm here to meet Ms. Cynthia.

69
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,640
Please tell her.
- Okay. I'll let her know you're here.

70
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,480
I'm waiting here.

71
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,890
Okay.
- My name is Praful Patel.

72
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,850
Gotcha.

73
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,430
Hey Cynthia, your appointment is here.

74
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,310
Okay, I'll let her know.

75
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,600
Ms. Patel, Cynthia will see you now.
- Thank you.

76
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,850
Ma'am, if you can process
my loan little quickly.

77
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,890
I have two weeks...

78
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,560
Well, it's good that you got a pre
approval on the mortgage. - Yes.

79
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
It shouldn't be a problem.

80
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,600
I just need to check your
credit scores and we should be fine.

81
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,150
This is my...
- Alright.

82
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,980
I just need you to sign this.

83
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,060
And this.

84
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,480
And...

85
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,890
This.

86
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,520
Can I borrow your pen?
- Yes.

87
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,390
Over here?
- Yes.

88
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,020
Alright, I'll call you on Monday.

89
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,680
Alright! Okay.

90
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,810
Thank you.

91
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,980
One margherita pizza please.

92
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,230
And... garlic bread also.

93
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:17,690
Hello, Amber...

94
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,890
Sorry, I missed all your calls.

95
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,720
I've been quite busy.

96
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,640
So tell me, all the preparations
for the wedding going smooth...

97
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,450
My To-be-bride?

98
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,180
Listen Praf, you have to come
to Las Vegas with me.

99
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,680
Las Vegas? What for?

100
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,840
Nothing. We'll shop,
Like a bachelorette.

101
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,730
Just you and me.

102
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:33,930
Bachelorette?

103
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,210
With me?

104
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,600
Wendy and other
friends are not coming?

105
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,680
No Praf, it's just you and me.

106
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,270
That is sweet.

107
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:47,000
But Amber,
I'm kind of saving up for my house.

108
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,740
So, I won't be able to spend much...

109
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,890
Hey, I'm paying for the trip.
You're coming for free!

110
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,850
Really?

111
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,880
Las Vegas for free!

112
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,850
Good offer.

113
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:57,640
But...

114
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,020
But I can't.

115
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,390
I won't be able to make it.

116
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,930
Praf...

117
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,520
No way... Not again!

118
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,230
What problem do you
have with my flowers?

119
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,810
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- You destroy them every day!

120
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,140
I've got margherita pizza for you.

121
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,730
Lock the car.
Come in.

122
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,980
You should go back to the driving school.
- Come on! Come on! Come on!

123
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,140
Oh wow!

124
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,480
Just what I had in mind!

125
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,810
I've been craving for some pizza.

126
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,310
Why so generous today?

127
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,020
What's the occasion?

128
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,900
Papa, you have a small
pocket and a small heart!

129
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,020
So says the miser.

130
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,890
As if you're super generous.

131
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,140
I've been feeding you two
since the past 30 years...

132
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,350
... and what have you spent on this family
from the time you've started earning?

133
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,980
Papa, let me buy my house.

134
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,310
Then my salary will be at
your disposal and you'll be rich!

135
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,890
Buying property is no joke!

136
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,440
What do you know about the area?
Whether it has any appreciation?

137
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,310
You have to understand all these
factors. Do you even know any of this?

138
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,850
What makes you think they'll
approve your loan?

139
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,100
Papa, you always underestimate me.

140
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,350
To make the impossible possible,
that's what Praful Patel does!

141
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,770
Stop nagging her...

142
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,310
Let her invest.

143
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,850
You're always sitting
behind the counter of a shop.

144
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,850
She's just come home, tired, after
sweeping and mopping floors all day.

145
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,640
Let her eat in peace.
- Mummy, it's not sweeping and mopping.

146
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,230
I work in the hotel industry.

147
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,470
What did I teach you?
- Yeah.

148
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,930
Housekeeping department.
- Yeah, yeah.

149
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,780
Show some respect. - I spend
my day sitting behind a counter.

150
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,230
And you? In front of the computer...

151
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,230
Shopping online all day long.

152
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,640
It's not like I'm buying
gold or diamonds...

153
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,520
I buy groceries for the house.

154
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,520
That too because my knees trouble me.

155
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,480
Do you have the money
for a visit to the doctor?

156
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,810
Is it an emergency?

157
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,810
She is your daughter. Talk to her...

158
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,520
I am saying this for her own good.

159
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,600
If she has saved some money then
she should invest it in my business.

160
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,230
Business?
Your Gujarati snacks business?

161
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,850
Papa, it is below my intelligence.

162
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,810
As if you have conquered
Everest with your intelligence.

163
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,930
I've been working like a servant
so you could have a better future.

164
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,390
I called you here to get an education.

165
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,480
But you decided to fall
in love as soon as you got here.

166
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,890
You got married despite
our disapproval.

167
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,680
And she couldn't even handle that.

168
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,980
She got divorced even
though we told her not to.

169
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,480
And she talks about intelligence.

170
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,310
Praful, people get out and
achieve the impossible here.

171
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,020
... and look at you,
you're still a burden to me.

172
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,680
It would've been better if
I hadn't asked you two to come here.

173
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,100
We were better off in Ahmedabad.

174
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,020
I'm buying my own house so that
I'm no longer a burden to you.

175
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,390
Really?
- So what is the problem now?

176
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
Huh?
- Why don't you get married, dear?

177
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,640
You will get your own house too!

178
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,930
In a few years, these proposals
you are getting now will also stop.

179
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,230
And why do you want your own house?

180
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,680
To call your boyfriends over?

181
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,480
Yes, I'll call my boyfriends.

182
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,730
What? You'll call
your boyfriends over?

183
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,310
No. It's better you don't buy
your own house.

184
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,850
She's a girl that too a divorcee.

185
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,890
And she talks about bringing
her boyfriends over.

186
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,560
She wants to ruin my image in society.
- What society are you talking about?

187
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,390
You are on the grassroots level
of the society you are talking about.

188
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,110
You can see everyone up there,
but no one wants to look down, at you.

189
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,810
Nobody cares. So just chill.

190
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,770
Did you hear that?
How highly our daughter thinks of me?

191
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,180
The things she says
about her own father!

192
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,430
Exactly why she couldn't
achieve anything so far.

193
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,230
Mistakes, mistakes and more mistakes!

194
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,810
Kumud, let me give it
to you in writing.

195
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,310
She is once again
going to make a mistake!

196
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,930
Yes, I'll make mistakes!

197
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,890
I make mistakes!
But I also agree to making them.

198
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,020
I don't lie to myself like you two.
Look at yourselves.

199
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,410
If this is how married couples behave,
then it's better to be a divorcee.

200
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,230
Get out of my house then!

201
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,430
If we are so bad then
why do you stay with us?

202
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,430
Get out of my house!

203
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,140
Don't yell! It will do you more harm.

204
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,680
All because of you!
- You'll get a heart attack.

205
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,350
We have just one daughter!

206
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,770
Just eat the pizza.
- And you couldn't even take care of her.

207
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:35,520
What have I...

208
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,270
You two have made
my life a living hell.

209
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,270
I'd rather be dead.
- Will you stop it and just eat?

210
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,390
This is all because of you.

211
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,430
Because of me?

212
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,930
Go! You too go with her.

213
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,890
Yes, I would, but I cannot walk!

214
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:49,420
You don't have the money for the doctor!
- I should have left you both in Ahmedabad...

215
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,730
Hello, Amber?

216
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,100
Let's go to Vegas.

217
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,310
This is... This is like so big...

218
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,030
Quite big for one person.

219
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,100
Don't look back.

220
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,680
Why?
- Your idiot ex is here.

221
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,640
Come on, let's leave.

222
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,940
Hey!
- Hi!

223
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,220
How you doing?

224
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,850
So good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

225
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,350
Hi.

226
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,060
Hello.

227
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,350
You're Amber's cousin?

228
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,140
The one who works in the hotel.
- Yeah, Praf.

229
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,260
I met you at your engagement,
which you both broke.

230
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,270
You both carry on.

231
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,980
I'll see you in the hotel.

232
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,800
Praf...

233
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,560
No one at home should
find out about this.

234
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,930
I can trust you, right?

235
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,110
That's why I am here...

236
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,930
That's why you brought
me along and no one else.

237
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,430
You can trust me.

238
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,180
Are you seriously upset?

239
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,890
It's not a big deal.

240
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,560
You could have told me.
But anyway, don't worry.

241
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,100
Just don't elope with him.

242
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,310
Otherwise, your family will kill me.

243
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,080
I'm getting married soon.

244
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,850
I'm only here to say goodbye.

245
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,890
Say your goodbye and
I'll see you in the hotel.

246
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,980
But where will you go?

247
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,770
I'll find something sinful
to do in this sin city.

248
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,100
Put money.

249
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,100
Put money.
- I don't have money.

250
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,500
No, no. Put money.
Yes, it's my job.

251
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,320
Hello.
- Hey! How are you?

252
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,480
This is nice.
- Yes.

253
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,270
How much is this for?
- That's 10 dollars.

254
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,060
10 dollars? Can you give me in five?

255
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,600
No, I cannot sell it for less than 10.

256
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,810
How much is this for?
- 20 dollars.

257
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,930
If you give me two then
in 10 I can buy this. - Thank you.

258
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,180
No, it's 10 dollars.
- But this is not for 10 dollars.

259
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,730
Take it. It's my gift to you.

260
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,390
Take it? - Yes, take it.
My gift to you. Okay?

261
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,270
Thank you.
- Yeah.

262
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,550
That clip, how much?
I can pay for this.

263
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,620
Take it, my gift. Take it.

264
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,850
Thank you.

265
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,140
Well, hello.

266
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,370
Hello.
- How's it going?

267
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,180
Good.
- Alright, what can I get you, babe?

268
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,560
I want some pink
champagne and some caviar.

269
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,140
Yeah.
- But I cannot afford it.

270
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,560
So give me some beer.

271
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,520
And some french-fries
complimentary from your side.

272
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,230
Ah, well we don't
have free french-fries.

273
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,980
Chips?

274
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,310
No chips either.

275
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,520
Peanuts?
- We have some peanuts.

276
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,430
Get some then.
- Alright, alright.

277
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,390
Calm down.

278
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,270
Hey!

279
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,580
How you doing?

280
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,350
Yeah

281
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:20,640
You like that?

282
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,230
He's hot.

283
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:24,980
Yeah, he was here last night.

284
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,140
I think he is here for the weekend.

285
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,730
But he's by himself.

286
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,810
You think I should try my luck?

287
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,400
Of course, look at where you are.
You're in Vegas.

288
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,180
I am in Vegas.
- Go for it. Get him.

289
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,670
Hello.
I'm Prafu...

290
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,220
I'm Praf from Atlanta.

291
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,400
Are you tired?

292
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,020
Because you are running in my mind.

293
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,100
I saw it.

294
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,790
But I mean it was kinda cheesy.

295
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,270
You can do better.

296
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,400
I can do better but
I need another chance.

297
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,240
He left.

298
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,560
No, he's probably playing Baccarat.
He loves that game over there.

299
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,600
What is Baccarat?

300
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,230
Oh, you've never
seen the James Bond movies?

301
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,640
Hello.

302
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,230
Hi.

303
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:51,850
Hi.

304
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,770
There you go.
- Pleasure.

305
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,930
Do you want to play?

306
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,100
This is a five-dollar chip.

307
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,180
He will deal the cards.

308
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,020
One to the bank and one to the player.

309
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,810
You have to place
a bet on one of them.

310
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,520
And the number which is
closest to the number nine wins.

311
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,850
Baccarat is all about number nine.

312
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,480
Do you want to play?

313
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,310
Why not?
- Go ahead.

314
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,020
Give me ten dollar chips.

315
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,430
Minimum is 25, ma'am.

316
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,310
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

317
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,390
Take this.
- Oh.

318
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,520
Thank you, buddy.

319
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,020
No problem.
Dave Mehta, New Jersey.

320
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,680
Praful Patel from Atlanta.

321
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,390
Gujarati?

322
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
You too?
- Yup.

323
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,560
Shall we?

324
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,730
Let's play.

325
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,390
All set?

326
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,980
Cards are out.

327
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,270
Player wins the set.

328
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,100
We won.

329
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,020
This is yours.

330
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,770
This is 50.
- 50.

331
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,730
All yours.

332
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,580
The bank wins.

333
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,180
There you go! We win again!

334
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,140
We won! Again!

335
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,560
And this is all yours.

336
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,180
Tie.

337
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,440
It's a Tie.
- Oh my God!

338
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,520
There you go!

339
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,750
Player wins.

340
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,180
Player wins.
- Oh man!

341
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,280
Player wins.

342
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,060
Hello?
Amber, I won 2000 dollars!

343
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,630
Huh?
Oh, my God!

344
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:47,850
Are you okay?

345
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,150
Okay, coming, coming.

346
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,100
I'm coming.

347
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,980
No, I am coming.

348
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,350
Thank you very much.

349
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,170
Amber!

350
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,670
Get it out.

351
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,210
Get it all out.

352
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,760
Just let it all come out.

353
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,460
Nikhil is bad, Praf.

354
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,710
You shouldn't have met him.

355
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,250
I think I'm still in love with him.

356
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,590
Then why don't you marry him?

357
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,250
Because he doesn't
want to get married.

358
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,170
Then don't marry anyone.

359
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,090
That is not how it happens, Praf.

360
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,560
You cannot spend your life alone.

361
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,460
I'm doing just fine.

362
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:03,500
Not you.
You're so different and independent.

363
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,630
I'm a 30-year-old divorcee.

364
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,340
You are a 25-year-old young girl.

365
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,750
I'm a housekeeper.
You're a jewelry designer.

366
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,000
How can I be more
independent than you?

367
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,920
I don't know, Praf.

368
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,630
Don't ask me these questions.

369
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,380
By the way, you're going
to meet Hitesh at my wedding.

370
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,750
If he's going to
attend it then I am not.

371
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,460
Don't be so serious. He's
not coming.

372
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,250
Why don't you come with Mike?

373
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,340
Mike is last season.

374
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,290
You left him as well?

375
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,040
There was a small girl.

376
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,250
She asked her mother,
"Mother, what is a boyfriend?"

377
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,870
Her mother said "If you become
a good girl you will get one."

378
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,250
Then the small girl said,
"Mother, if I become a bad girl?"

379
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,710
The mother said "Then
you will get many."

380
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,380
What!

381
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,790
God, You're so weird!

382
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,870
Heavenly angels

383
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:12,770
Brought heaven closer

384
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,650
What I see on the ground...

385
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:25,400
Is it a guiding light or a refuge...

386
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,070
Shadows of heaven...

387
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,690
Have bestowed heaven upon me...

388
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,440
Dear life...

389
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,510
Fate has changed...

390
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:46,600
Now break the bond and live a little...

391
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,630
How are you?

392
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,500
I am okay.
- I have got something for you.

393
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,880
What's this?

394
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,770
Please keep it.

395
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:52,660
Thank you.

396
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:59,400
Break the prison and fly away...

397
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:05,700
Spread your wings and fly away...

398
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:11,800
Break the prison and fly away...

399
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,840
Spread your wings and fly away...

400
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,880
Wow!

401
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,460
My gosh, you look amazing.

402
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,880
That dress!

403
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,290
400 dollars.

404
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,500
And your lipstick!

405
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,880
50 dollars.

406
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,210
Now get me some pink champagne.

407
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,880
You mean beer and peanuts?

408
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,090
No, I mean pink champagne.

409
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,960
Yeah!

410
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,340
Hello!
- Hello! Welcome to the game.

411
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,920
Give me... chips for... for 200.

412
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,250
Okay.

413
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,750
It looks like we've got
some unfinished business.

414
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,790
I hope you don't lose
all that money today.

415
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,840
Place your bets.

416
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,710
Player.

417
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,790
Bank.

418
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,210
Player.

419
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,840
Excuse me.

420
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,040
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

421
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,380
Hi.
- Hi.

422
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,250
I'm Adam from California.

423
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:58,380
Hi, Adam.

424
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,500
You look beautiful.

425
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,090
Thank you.

426
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,000
Why did you leave after
losing just two games?

427
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,750
Because I don't have
more money to play now.

428
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,630
You know, you can win a
lot of money by playing baccarat.

429
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,960
In just a few minutes.

430
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,630
You just have to
play five to six rounds.

431
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,130
Why five to six rounds?

432
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,420
I've read that
when you play five to six rounds...

433
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,880
...your chances of winning are higher,
like last night.

434
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,710
Ya, I won.

435
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,250
Let me get that.

436
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,630
I cannot take your tip for free.

437
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,250
Fine.

438
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,420
I'll make you work for it.

439
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,920
Where is the protection?

440
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,290
I don't have it.

441
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,040
You don't have protection?

442
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,090
No.

443
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,540
Wait... No, it's fine.

444
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,130
Zip my dress up!

445
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,420
You are a cute guy,
but not a decent guy.

446
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:39,250
No protection no sex, my friend.

447
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,230
Hey Dave!

448
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,580
Praf! How are you?

449
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,000
How you doing?
- Great!

450
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,960
What's this?
- I won this at the table today!

451
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,710
Yes.
- Where you played?

452
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,460
I am playing at the big table.

453
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,630
I am going to cash
this and enjoy myself.

454
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,000
Bye, see you!
- Bye, you look beautiful Praf!

455
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,960
Praful! What the hell are you doing?
We are going to miss our flight.

456
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,880
Sorry, sorry!
I need to play one more round.

457
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,990
I can't miss this flight.

458
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,480
You stay and gamble if you want to.
I'm going.

459
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,840
Just one round!
- You haven't even packed yet!

460
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,960
Amber, just one round.
Amber!

461
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,960
Packing will take two minutes!

462
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,710
Wait! Amber!

463
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,170
Amber, wait!

464
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,460
So you're trying to say that...

465
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,590
... you lost all the money you won...

466
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,880
... and you also lost 8000 out of the
money you had saved for your house?

467
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,290
I just needed one more round!

468
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,090
What do you mean you
needed one more round, Praf?

469
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,590
Gambling is like that only.

470
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,290
If you don't lose how will you win?

471
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,290
You need to lose some to win some.

472
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,840
Praf! Get a hold of yourself, man!

473
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,710
This is how people
get into big trouble.

474
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,840
8000 dollars is a lot of money!

475
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,340
Hello.

476
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:18,840
Where have you been?

477
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,130
Look dear, we cannot live our
lives like Amber and her parents.

478
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,420
They can afford it.
They're rich. We aren't.

479
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,250
Mohan, let her at
least take a breather.

480
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,920
Praful, have you eaten
or shall I get you something?

481
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,880
No, she must be tired from
all the sightseeing in Vegas.

482
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,500
Sure. Please, go ahead.
Feed her all you want.

483
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,880
She has all the money to have fun.

484
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,460
Where do you get the money from?

485
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,540
Praful!

486
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,170
The electricity bill is due.

487
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,500
It's kept on the table. Pay it.

488
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,080
Hello, Mr. Steven.
- Ms. Patel.

489
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,840
We were supposed to meet
today to discuss paperwork?

490
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,420
Are you okay?

491
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,590
Mr. Steven.
I've fallen sick. Very badly.

492
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,960
Have you been to the doctor?

493
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,250
I need one more week you see.

494
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,890
I... I have multiple health problems.

495
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,250
I'll try the best I can.

496
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,960
I have, I have the money it's
just that my health is not okay.

497
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,880
Okay, well please just
take care of yourself. Okay?

498
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,290
I'll talk to you later.

499
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,420
Hey Cynthia,
you've got a customer, Ms...?

500
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,210
Patel! - Ms. Patel.

501
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,130
She said she just wants two minutes.

502
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,750
Just two... just... yeah.

503
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,250
Alright.

504
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,880
Okay, I'll let her in.

505
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,160
Okay.
- Thank you.

506
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,840
Hello ma'am, I just want to
know when is my loan getting approved?

507
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,630
Give me a moment, please.

508
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:46,500
I tried to call many times
but I did not get any appointment.

509
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,840
No response.

510
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,460
Ms. Patel...

511
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:53,540
I have been through your account
and as much as I'd like to help...

512
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,920
You're not eligible for a loan.

513
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,000
Why?

514
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,840
Your credit rating is very low.

515
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,920
It seems you've emptied
your account in one day.

516
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,250
That was for something urgent.

517
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,130
But I have the pre approval.
You only told me.

518
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,500
Your credit rating is very low.

519
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:15,380
But if I had funds
why would I need a loan?

520
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,040
I'm sorry but that's how banks work,
Ms. Patel.

521
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,000
Our borrowers borrow money.

522
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:25,210
People who can't repay try to steal,
not borrow.

523
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,090
Are you trying to
say I am trying to steal?

524
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,460
No, of course not.

525
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,750
But if you really want this loan.

526
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,290
I suggest you work to improve
your funds over the next few months.

527
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,130
But I have...
- You have a good day.

528
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,250
I'll see you later.

529
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,290
Thank you.

530
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,590
Papa!

531
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,500
Why all of a sudden?
Are you feeling alright?

532
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,840
I'm being affectionate.
Can't I?

533
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,040
What's this?

534
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,630
Tomato and pepper curry.

535
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:21,380
Papa, my friend Salma's father
passed away from a heart attack.

536
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:26,420
That made me think that I
shouldn't trouble my parents so much.

537
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,210
It happens. It happens.

538
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,460
You shouldn't let it bother
you so much. It happens.

539
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,040
Papa, will you come with
me to see my flat tomorrow?

540
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,250
Why me, all of a sudden?

541
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,790
Not all of a sudden.

542
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:44,840
I've decided that I won't
do anything without your permission.

543
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,840
Sorry, I was about go buy a house...

544
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,590
... for myself without informing
you or taking your advice.

545
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:56,210
But papa, I want to invest
in this property only with you.

546
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,340
We will buy a joint property.

547
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,880
Really?

548
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,590
Joint property?

549
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,420
I don't think you know
anything about investment.

550
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,460
If you need help then
why don't you say so.

551
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:16,090
Okay. Well, why hide
anything from you, papa...

552
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,340
Help me a little?

553
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:22,750
I can help you,
but I have a condition.

554
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,250
Tell me.

555
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,340
We have got a very
good marriage proposal.

556
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,540
He's the son of the owner
of Parekh Hosiery in Rajkot.

557
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,040
He's very handsome.

558
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,540
And he is single.

559
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,000
If you meet him...

560
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,710
Welcome back!
- Thank you!

561
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,380
So is it a beer or
champagne kinda day?

562
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,540
No drinking.
I have to win my money back.

563
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,880
You... you mean you have
to win back the money you lost.

564
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,540
I lost some of my savings.

565
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,000
I am in trouble.

566
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,540
Look, I am not supposed to say this...

567
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,540
... but if I were you,
I wouldn't go back and play.

568
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,670
Any more bets?

569
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,130
Okay, no more bets?

570
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,420
Player shows six.
Banker banks on nine.

571
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,790
Banker wins.

572
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,730
Excuse me!

573
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,250
What you want, huh?

574
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,920
Here's a watch.

575
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,880
It's worth 15,000 at least.

576
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,040
What about the car outside?

577
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,920
I'll give you the pink slip, alright?

578
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,590
65,000 any day.

579
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,250
Mike, you owe me 85,000 dollars.

580
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,090
I couldn't get 10 for this.

581
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:37,040
And your car... is a piece of junk.

582
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,340
Place you bets please.

583
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,090
Ma'am, are you okay?

584
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,840
You guys have taken it all away.

585
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,840
You have stolen everything.
This is cheating!

586
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,290
Ma'am, please calm down.

587
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,040
I want to talk to the owner.

588
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,290
Ma'am, please calm down.

589
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,040
You guys have stolen
my seven years' worth savings.

590
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:58,210
Calm down or we'll
have to call security.

591
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,130
Call your owner.

592
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:05,670
I... I will not go anywhere.
I will be here today!

593
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,130
Calm down, calm down.

594
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,290
Are you the owner?

595
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,250
Come on. Come here.

596
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,750
I want to talk to you.
- We can talk. Come here.

597
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,840
Come here. We can talk. We can talk.

598
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:23,880
Give me my money back. You
are cheaters, all of you are cheaters!

599
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,500
You are all thieves!

600
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,750
I'm not the owner. I'm not the owner.

601
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,380
I'm a private moneylender.

602
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,290
You wanna win all your money back,
don't you?

603
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,250
I lost all my savings.

604
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,840
It's all good, baby.

605
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,670
So how much you need?

606
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,670
You are very sweet.
You want to give me money.

607
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:41,960
You're a nice man.

608
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,670
It's all good. It's all good.

609
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,130
So how much do you need?

610
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,290
25,000?

611
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:51,960
No.

612
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,460
32,000.
- That's it.

613
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,130
I want to show him a lesson!

614
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,250
Hey...
- You cheaters...

615
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,290
I'm going to need your
social security card.

616
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,210
Why?
- Your drivers' license.

617
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,500
Why?

618
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,750
I just gave you 32,000 dollars,
baby girl!

619
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:18,630
Thank you, buddy.
You're a good person, huh?

620
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,290
Thank you very much.
- Now go show him a lesson.

621
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,030
Place your bets please.

622
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,920
Place your bets please.

623
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,070
Banker.

624
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,170
Banker.

625
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,290
Hi ma'am,
would you like to buy some more?

626
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,420
Place your bets please.

627
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,310
How many 'Ghaatiyas'
(Gujarati snacks)?

628
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:35,430
Six.

629
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,270
Six.

630
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,020
Four of 'Sev'(Gujarati snacks),
right?

631
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,560
Five.
- 'Sev'.

632
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:41,980
Five.

633
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,140
'Bhakarwadi'(Gujarati snacks).
One, two, three, four, five, six...

634
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,310
Mohan's new import.

635
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,230
He has imported snacks from Rajkot.
- Four...

636
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,810
Here, taste it.

637
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,100
Chutney...

638
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,230
Four...

639
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:02,210
Papa, you were saying
something the other day...

640
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,920
That if I agree to
meet the boy then...

641
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,920
You were saying something like that.

642
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,670
Praful, you...

643
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:13,000
Now when she is saying
that she'll meet the boy...

644
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,830
... then why are you questioning her?

645
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,290
I suggest you invite
them over tomorrow itself.

646
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,500
Done.

647
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,670
We'll call them over.

648
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:29,420
Praful, that's Mr. and Mrs. Parekh.

649
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,080
You remember Kaushal?

650
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,370
He has a hosiery shop in Rajkot.
He is his cousin.

651
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:35,790
How are you, auntie?

652
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,120
How are you, uncle?

653
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,500
All good, dear.

654
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,620
He's Kaushal's elder son.

655
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,500
Sameer.
- Hello.

656
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,270
Hello.

657
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,540
You work in a hotel?

658
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,250
Housekeeping department.

659
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,210
Very good.

660
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:50,120
She will keep the house clean.

661
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,290
Anyway, a housewife
is a housekeeper, right?

662
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,460
Dear, you have been working
in the same hotel for seven years?

663
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,170
Yes.

664
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,670
After the divorce, right?

665
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,960
Sameer, you have come here for MBA?

666
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,960
Yes, auntie.

667
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:10,750
Your aunt told me that
you have a new startup plan.

668
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:14,290
Yes, actually I plan
to make a mobile app.

669
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,330
Wonderful.

670
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,670
Nowadays everyone uses apps.

671
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:22,120
My wife is an online champion.
She does everything online.

672
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:26,040
Prayers happening in Atlanta
but pundit sitting in Nathdwara.

673
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,830
Actually,
my app too is related to our culture.

674
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,830
You can view all religious
places in India through that.

675
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,790
You can watch its live telecast.

676
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,120
Press a button and offer flowers.

677
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,500
Press another button
and feed the poor.

678
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,670
Instant karma.

679
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,170
Hail Lord Shiva.

680
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,290
Wonderful.

681
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:51,120
I think the kids should
talk to each other.

682
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,370
Yes, sure.

683
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,210
Why do you want to get married?

684
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:20,580
For a green card?

685
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,330
No.

686
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,250
I mean I am doing my MBA here.

687
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,790
I can easily spend two years
here without getting married.

688
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,710
I want to get married
because I am alone.

689
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,080
Life will get better
if I find a life partner.

690
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,690
Anyway, if two people earn
then the expenses get divided.

691
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,580
So your wife will earn
and you will educate yourself?

692
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,170
No.

693
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,040
I have worked for two years.

694
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,920
I have money for my education.

695
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,920
I wanted to be a self-made man.

696
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:57,620
And I have a plan for that too.

697
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,460
I just need a purpose.

698
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,210
I am searching for it.

699
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,040
You think you will get purpose,
love, companionship...

700
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,870
... all nicely wrapped
in a package called marriage?

701
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:12,710
I don't know.

702
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,330
I will try to be true to
this relationship to the best I can.

703
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,000
Then we will see where life takes us.

704
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,540
I too gave my best to a relationship.

705
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,460
Look at what happened to me.

706
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:27,370
What if life brings
you to a similar juncture?

707
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,250
What if you are standing
where I am standing today?

708
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,040
So what's wrong?

709
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,250
The weather is wonderful.

710
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:35,920
It's not raining either.

711
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,120
And I don't think
my company is that bad either.

712
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,580
Right?

713
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,500
You tend to romanticize things.

714
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,670
You too are quite frank.

715
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,310
It was a pleasure to meet you.

716
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,080
Shall we go back?

717
00:43:58,830 --> 00:43:59,620
Let's go...

718
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:05,920
Praful.

719
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,330
She's asleep.

720
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,580
No.

721
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:16,170
Praful, I liked this boy.

722
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:22,870
Mummy, papa told me that
he would help me if I meet the boy.

723
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,330
What do you mean?

724
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:28,920
He told me that he would
help me if I meet the boy.

725
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,920
Really? When did that happen?

726
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:33,290
Mummy...

727
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,580
Tell me, how did you like Sameer?

728
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:41,200
I'll never get such a house
again in minority housing.

729
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:45,420
Okay, dear.

730
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:46,870
Don't worry.

731
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:51,710
I'll talk to your father
when he's in a good mood.

732
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:56,420
But at least tell me
what you though of Sameer...

733
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,250
Good night.

734
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:00,120
Good night.

735
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,000
Hello, Mr. Steven.

736
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,620
Yes, Ms. Patel.

737
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:16,960
I need some more time.

738
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,080
I'm... I'm sorry Ms. Patel,
but that house is sold.

739
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,120
That house is sold?

740
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,790
Yes.

741
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,420
But you said you will wait for me.

742
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,250
I know, but it has been a while
since you called back, Ms. Patel.

743
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,920
I am sorry I just
couldn't wait anymore.

744
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:57,870
Granny!

745
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,080
Oh my baby! Come here. Come here.

746
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:03,290
How are you?

747
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:04,920
I am fine.

748
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:10,290
But you neither call,
whatsapp or snapchat.

749
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,920
Don't you miss Nathdwara?
- I do.

750
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,120
Then why this half smile?

751
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,750
It's a full smile.

752
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,710
But it doesn't reach your eyes.

753
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,540
I had found a nice
house in minority housing.

754
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,620
But I lost that deal.

755
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:31,870
It's okay, you'll find another one.

756
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,460
Oh, my God. Him?
What is he doing here?

757
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,250
Who?

758
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:41,080
The boy who had come to see me.
- Which one?

759
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:45,040
That one. The stupid looking one...
oh shit, he saw me.

760
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,290
Hi, Praful.
- Hello.

761
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,080
My granny.

762
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:52,500
I seek your blessings.
- It's okay. God bless you.

763
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,170
Why do I feel as if
she was badmouthing me?

764
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,000
It's not that...

765
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:01,750
She was saying that sweet
boy had come to see her.

766
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,620
Did she say that?
- Yes.

767
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:06,870
Does she like this sweet boy?

768
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:09,830
She likes you.

769
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,120
It's not so.

770
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,960
I still haven't thought about that.

771
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,540
After all she's a girl.

772
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,330
This...

773
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,500
I knew I'd find Praful
here so I brought this along.

774
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:24,960
What's this?

775
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:26,370
Have a look.

776
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,840
This belongs to my grandma.

777
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,000
I wanted to give it to
the one I'd spend my life with.

778
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,660
You still carry your grandma's
last memento in your pocket?

779
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,620
It's not so.

780
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:44,750
You tend to have your heart broken a
few times by the time you reach this age.

781
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:46,420
This is its third copy.

782
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:53,370
Third copy or the fourth copy,
it should be its last copy.

783
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,670
You are absolutely right.

784
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,000
Keep it, dear.

785
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,290
Granny!
- Take it.

786
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:59,170
Let's go.
The function is about to begin.

787
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,170
Come on, lets go.

788
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:14,000
The function is about to begin.

789
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:21,100
"Madam's Indian,
but follows western fashion."

790
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:24,610
"Her words are often coated
in honey and then some."

791
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:28,060
"She moves in style,
she's full of pride."

792
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,810
"Her conversations are hi-fi!"

793
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:35,080
"Her attitude towards
her beloved's different."

794
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,650
"She swirls in such a way
that she cannot be stopped."

795
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,420
"When baby dances all dressed
up she looks breathtaking."

796
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:45,010
"When baby dances all dressed
up she looks breathtaking."

797
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:48,470
"When baby dances all dressed
up she looks breathtaking."

798
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:52,040
"When baby dances all dressed
up she looks breathtaking."

799
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:09,750
"My boy's handsome
and you girl's beautiful."

800
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:13,240
"Everyone feels that
this match is made in heaven."

801
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,830
"My boy's handsome
and you girl's beautiful."

802
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:20,680
"Everyone feels that
this match is made in heaven."

803
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:31,220
"Live a happy and a blessed life."

804
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:34,760
"Keep glowing like a LED light."

805
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:41,690
"Live a happy and a blessed life."

806
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,150
"Keep glowing like a LED light."

807
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:48,690
"Everyone's blessing
you with a good fate."

808
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:51,750
"May this couple always
remain smiling and sate."

809
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,710
"Keep your family's photo close."

810
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:58,500
"We don't want you
to forget us almost."

811
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,900
"When baby dances all dressed
up she looks breathtaking."

812
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:05,530
"When baby dances all dressed
up she looks breathtaking."

813
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:08,990
"When baby dances all dressed
up she looks breathtaking."

814
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:12,720
"When baby dances all dressed
up she looks breathtaking."

815
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:29,400
"When baby dances all dressed up..."

816
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,900
"When baby dances all dressed up..."

817
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:37,130
"When baby dances all dressed
up she looks breathtaking."

818
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:52,670
Well, don't you look good?

819
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:56,670
Indian princess, huh?

820
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,920
So, was this your wedding?

821
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:03,080
No, it is my... it
is my cousin's wedding.

822
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,170
We apologize for disturbing you here.

823
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,750
We stopped by your house first.

824
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,650
But you weren't there.

825
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,540
We cannot have this conversation here.

826
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:23,080
I have your number.
I will call you. You please go.

827
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:26,620
I'm not going anywhere
without my money.

828
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:32,250
You ran off with 32,000 dollars,
it's been fifteen days.

829
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:35,120
With interest that's 40,000

830
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:39,250
So we might as well
round it up to... to 50,000.

831
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,540
Look, I lost all that
money you know that.

832
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:54,830
I don't have any
money right now but...

833
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,580
But you're asking me for 50,000.

834
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,330
Why should I give you 50,000?

835
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:02,170
You came and gave me that money!

836
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,920
I did not ask you for that money!

837
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,980
And now you are coming
to my relative's house...

838
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:30,170
I'm sorry.

839
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,460
I should've not
run with your money.

840
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,460
But I don't have any money right now.

841
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:48,580
I'm not asking, I'm telling you.

842
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:55,960
50,000, in 10 days.

843
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:17,580
Today's function went off well.

844
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,750
So many people attended it.
- It's just showoff.

845
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:21,830
They love to flaunt it to the society.
- They spent a lot.

846
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,290
They sent tickets and invited
so many people from India.

847
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:25,750
It was fun.

848
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:30,120
Did Praful tell you she
isn't buying the house?

849
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:38,370
No, she asked me to
talk to you for the money.

850
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:39,920
Why?

851
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,080
The other day she said
that she had the money.

852
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,540
Now why does she need the money
when she isn't buying the house?

853
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:50,040
I don't understand
what this girl is up to.

854
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:08,250
Papa...

855
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:11,120
I want to discuss something with you.

856
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:12,830
Tell me.

857
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:20,460
I need some money.

858
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:22,540
I'll return it.

859
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:24,920
But right now,
I need your help.

860
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:27,420
Why do you need the money?

861
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:33,920
I told you, I want to buy a house.
- Don't lie, Praful!

862
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:36,620
You are lying!

863
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,870
Your granny told me that
you aren't even buying a house.

864
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:44,420
Then why are you pretending
to buy the house?

865
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:47,120
To extract money from me?
Yes?

866
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:53,460
Where are you going?

867
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,500
Answer me!
Tell me!

868
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,170
She keeps on lying
that too to her father.

869
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,420
I wonder why God gave me such a child.

870
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,080
What is this?

871
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,790
The electricity bill is still here?

872
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,040
You don't have the
money to pay the bill!

873
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,750
But you have money
to go out and have fun!

874
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,290
Makes me angry to call you
my daughter.

875
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:24,540
Kumud, take the money
for the bill out from her bag.

876
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,500
What?

877
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,170
Didn't you hear what I said?

878
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:28,290
Take the money from her bag!

879
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:31,290
Do it or I'll throw
you both out of the house.

880
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:37,500
I am fed up of all
this nagging and bantering.

881
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,040
Here.

882
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,580
This is all your doing!

883
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:45,620
I've had it with you two!

884
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:51,920
Praful!

885
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:53,580
Praful!

886
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:54,790
Is this yours?

887
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:57,040
What is it doing on the guest's bed?

888
00:55:57,870 --> 00:55:59,870
I don't understand how many times...

889
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,830
Praful, what is going on?

890
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,870
Praful, talk to me.

891
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:10,830
Praful, do want to discuss something?

892
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:13,170
I have problems. Sorry.

893
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:14,920
What problems?

894
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,960
Just come back to me
and I'll solve them all.

895
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:21,960
Praful...

896
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,370
So... wow.

897
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:32,300
I miss you so much, Praful.

898
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:35,670
Mike...
- I promise...

899
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:39,370
Mike!
- Praful...

900
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:45,750
You better concentrate on your work.

901
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:39,210
Hello.
- Hey, how's it going?

902
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:43,460
It's declined.

903
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:50,080
It's declined, lady.
- Wait, it works.

904
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:52,120
It worked a few hours back.
- Well, it's not working now.

905
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,870
Let me try one more time.

906
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:00,710
It's declined.
- I pay cash.

907
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:01,580
Fine.

908
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,420
Hey no! Get that off of there!

909
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,040
Come on lady, I don't have all day.

910
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,440
Hurry please.
I had put money in this bag.

911
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,670
Then find it please.

912
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:31,580
Lady! Come on, I don't have all day.
- I have put it in this bag!

913
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:36,790
Lady...

914
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:38,540
Lady, what are you doing?
Get off the floor!

915
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,830
I've put money in this!
- Listen, it's fine...

916
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,540
I put money in this bag!

917
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:44,460
Jesus... It's fine.
It's just money, calm down.

918
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:46,420
I put it in this bag
and now it is not here!

919
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,540
Hey, calm down. It's just money, lady.

920
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:51,000
Hold on, I'll get you some water.

921
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,710
Jesus.

922
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:27,330
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

923
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:28,580
Hey!

924
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,310
Shit!

925
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:11,590
Good afternoon.
What can I do for you today?

926
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,750
Okay, okay.
You got any preference of bills?

927
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:44,460
She's gotta bomb!
Joyce! Phyllis!

928
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:45,670
Someone just tried to rob us.

929
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:48,540
I... I think she had
a bomb strapped to her.

930
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,080
Oh, I almost died.

931
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:06,610
Hello, Mr. Bugs.

932
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:07,980
Hey, you got my money?

933
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:11,320
Yes. I have your money.
Where can I come?

934
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:13,110
Do you have all my money?

935
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:15,860
Right now I have 10,000.
But...

936
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:18,610
Who the hell do you think I am?
A vacuum cleaner salesman?

937
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,440
There ain't no installments witch!

938
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:24,940
I want the whole 50,000 dollars!
- For that I need one month.

939
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,480
Hell no!

940
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:29,860
You got ten days!

941
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,190
Mr. Bugs?
- You hear me? Ten days!

942
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:55,280
What?

943
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:58,820
I think I've kept my top
in your cupboard by mistake.

944
01:03:58,940 --> 01:03:59,820
I'm just taking that.

945
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,030
Go. I'll get it for you.

946
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,230
Move aside.

947
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,650
What treasure are you hiding inside?

948
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:06,570
Where is it?

949
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,650
Mummy, I don't have
any privacy in this house.

950
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:14,230
Where... Ah.

951
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:16,530
Found it.

952
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:22,530
Look Praful, I don't like
locked doors and locked cupboards.

953
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:24,820
You don't hide anything
from your family.

954
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:25,820
Do you understand?

955
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,280
Praful...

956
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:52,610
Listen... please help me out today.

957
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:55,320
I need to go to Asif's school
to pick up his report card.

958
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,530
Okay, okay.

959
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:58,400
Okay, okay, okay. No problem.

960
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,280
Eleventh's west wing, right?
- Yeah.

961
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:04,860
Okay, okay. Coming, coming.

962
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:16,730
'In today's headlines:'

963
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:20,280
'A heavily armed woman robbed the
Barret Goodrich Bank of Atlanta.'

964
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:23,730
Praful... heard that?

965
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:26,360
'The cashier visibly
shaken by the episode...'

966
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,280
'...described her as heavily
armed and dangerous.'

967
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,010
'She had a bomb.'

968
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:34,170
Look how they are robbing banks in broad
daylight. - 'I couldn't see her face...'

969
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:38,360
'FBI is on a lookout for a petite
woman olive skin possibly Asian.'

970
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:42,570
'Heavily armed who used a peculiar note to
rob the Barrack Goodrich Bank in Atlanta.'

971
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:45,240
What was peculiar about
the bank robber's operation..

972
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,920
..was that the note
was written with a...

973
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,570
'Brace yourself... a lipstick.'

974
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:51,110
Oh God!

975
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:52,400
'And I was so scared.'

976
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,530
'I almost died in there.' - To buy bombs is
nowadays as easy as buying groceries.

977
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:58,650
'I don't want to stay
in America anymore.'

978
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:01,230
Now our money is not
even safe in the bank.

979
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:04,150
Look how they use
a lipstick to rob banks!

980
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,070
"She is agile."

981
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:25,030
"She has attitude." "She is restless."

982
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:28,230
"She can steal the sky
within a blink of an eye."

983
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,780
"Known, yet unknown..."

984
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:32,730
"A little crazy."

985
01:06:32,810 --> 01:06:35,510
"She makes everyone go crazy."

986
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:43,500
"She complicates the dilemma of the
heart and mind while simplifying it."

987
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:51,950
"Who knows where you'll go next."

988
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:59,950
"Who knows where you'll go next."

989
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:05,000
Hey guys, this week I am going
to teach you how to rob a bank.

990
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:11,760
Step One: Find yourself
the right bank.

991
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:19,250
She's little too much
a little too little...

992
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:23,310
A tempting danger...

993
01:07:23,390 --> 01:07:26,980
Incomplete stories and empty pockets...

994
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:30,740
Still dreams big...

995
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:34,610
Attracting like a magnet...

996
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:38,430
She hides them in her fist...

997
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:41,120
With her deep eyes...

998
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,750
Whenever she look at someone heart.

999
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:52,240
Step Two: You have to find something
with which you can spook the cashiers.

1000
01:07:57,470 --> 01:08:00,320
"Who knows where you'll go next."

1001
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,940
Once the cashiers are spooked,
you don't have to do anything.

1002
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:05,110
You just get the money.

1003
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:07,400
You walk into the bank empty-handed.

1004
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:10,160
And you walk out of the
bank with a sack of cash.

1005
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:24,260
"Who knows where you'll go next."

1006
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:31,890
"Who knows where you'll go next."

1007
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:38,280
So robbing a bank is as
easy as making a cup of coffee.

1008
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,730
After everything that has
been happening in the world..

1009
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,900
..everybody is afraid of a threat.

1010
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:46,400
And we can use that.

1011
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:50,910
So, on next week's tutorial:

1012
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,650
How to kill somebody
and not get caught.

1013
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,030
Ever.

1014
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:26,360
Praful!

1015
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:28,980
Yes?
- Praful!

1016
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:29,940
YES!

1017
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:32,190
Come here!

1018
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:35,440
Praful!

1019
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:36,940
Praful, come inside.

1020
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:38,610
Yes? What is it?

1021
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:41,280
Hey, what are you wearing?

1022
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,480
Jogging suit.

1023
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,110
You are anyway so slim.

1024
01:09:44,230 --> 01:09:47,860
Don't do any jogging,
the glow on your face will disappear.

1025
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:52,860
Tell me quickly, what is it?
I'll get late.

1026
01:09:53,070 --> 01:09:56,530
Instead of jogging let's
join a yoga class together.

1027
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:57,900
I'll get late.

1028
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:00,280
At least that won't take
away the glow on your face.

1029
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:02,230
Can I go, mummy?

1030
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:04,690
Go Simran, go.

1031
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:12,400
No boy can love you more than he does.

1032
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,650
Go, my child.

1033
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:17,440
Go to your Raj.

1034
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:19,320
Go, Simran.

1035
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:22,070
Go, live your life!
- Go Simran, go.

1036
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,440
Live your life!
- Go, my child. Go!

1037
01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:28,360
Simran! Praful!

1038
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:30,860
Get curd on your way back!

1039
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,530
I am making 'Thepla'
(flatbread) for breakfast.

1040
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,860
Hey! How are you?

1041
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:28,280
Come come come,
have a seat, have a seat.

1042
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,480
How can I help you today?

1043
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:31,150
Sit sit sit, come on.

1044
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:38,730
My name's Veena Malik.

1045
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:40,940
And I can help you today.

1046
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:42,780
How's it going?
- Good.

1047
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:45,110
Do you have an account with us?
- No.

1048
01:11:45,190 --> 01:11:48,530
No? Well,
zero balance account is fantastic.

1049
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:52,230
By the way,
I love the color of you hair.

1050
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:54,320
It's gorgeous!

1051
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:56,150
So what's your name?

1052
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,400
Simran?

1053
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:03,150
Simran! Now that's a beautiful name.

1054
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:04,440
Simran!

1055
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:07,610
Simran, can I have your ID please?

1056
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:12,280
It is in the car.
- Okay. No problem.

1057
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:16,690
Why don't you get your ID from your
car and I'll get a form started for you?

1058
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,360
Okay.
- Okay?

1059
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:20,940
Great! Fantastic!

1060
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:23,430
I'll see you in a little bit.
- Okay.

1061
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:29,850
Alright, I'll see you.

1062
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:33,670
"That's Simran!"

1063
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:35,430
"Hobbledehoy Simran!"

1064
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:39,400
"Who knows where you'll go next."

1065
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,270
"That's Simran!"

1066
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:43,520
"Fly away Simran!"

1067
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:47,290
"Who knows where you'll go next."

1068
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:50,450
Many dreams dwell in her eyes.

1069
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:51,670
Many dreams...

1070
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:55,510
They keep flying aimlessly.

1071
01:12:55,870 --> 01:12:58,170
Peeping out through the eyes.

1072
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:01,680
This poor helpless
mind filled with dreams.

1073
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:03,940
"That's Simran!"

1074
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:06,050
"Hobbledehoy Simran!"

1075
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:10,120
"Who knows where you'll go next."

1076
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,030
"That's Simran!"

1077
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:14,250
"Fly away Simran!"

1078
01:13:14,530 --> 01:13:18,170
"Who knows where you'll go next."

1079
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:19,960
"Hey Simran!"

1080
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,980
7000! Bloody misers!

1081
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,650
'She was terrifying.'

1082
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,230
'She had olive skin.'

1083
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:08,070
'She had sharp features and...and...
explosives around her waist.'

1084
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,690
'She was middle eastern.'

1085
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:15,440
'Definitely,
definitely trained by Al-Qaeda.'

1086
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,700
'The suspect is believed
to be Asian or Middle Eastern.'

1087
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:27,650
Why are they always Muslims?

1088
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:34,440
Papa, what do you think,
why do only Muslims do such things?

1089
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,650
Dear, it's the caste and the religion
which sets a person's mentality.

1090
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:40,900
It is not her caste
or religion's fault.

1091
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,570
The fault lies in her upbringing.

1092
01:14:43,070 --> 01:14:47,030
Mummy, that means
she had a bad upbringing.

1093
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:49,780
Yes. - Hundred percent.
I can give it in writing.

1094
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:52,900
Her father must be useless, right?

1095
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:55,210
Hundred percent.
I can give that too in writing.

1096
01:14:56,570 --> 01:14:58,940
He must be totally useless!
- 'Armed and extremely dangerous.'

1097
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:02,480
'Witnesses have reported she's wearing
a jacket equipped with explosives.'

1098
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:06,480
'We can also tell you at this time she's
writing notes with red lipstick.'

1099
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:08,690
'Those lipstick notes
are in evidence..'

1100
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:12,150
'..and being examined for poisons
and other biological hazards.'

1101
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,650
That's all for now.

1102
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:23,740
What all have you brought?

1103
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:26,440
I've brought 'Handvo', 'Fafda'
and 'Ghatiya' (Gujarati snacks).

1104
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:28,070
And some lemonade too.

1105
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,940
Lemonade's a waste.

1106
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:31,570
Look there, they are drinking beer.

1107
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:48,280
Do you always go
out with your uncle and aunt?

1108
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:50,190
No, it's not so.

1109
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,530
I don't have any other way
to meet you.

1110
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,400
You know how many phone
calls I made to your father?

1111
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:57,480
He must be fed up!

1112
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:00,070
Why didn't you ask me for my number?

1113
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:03,610
I don't know.
- Shall we sit here?

1114
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:05,360
Yeah, sure. Please.

1115
01:16:09,230 --> 01:16:11,230
You are a good boy.

1116
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,610
You go meet the girl
with your guardians.

1117
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:15,610
You wear tailored pants and shirts.

1118
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,610
You are simple, decent Mr. Right.

1119
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:21,030
Don't get fooled by my dressing sense.

1120
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:23,900
I agree that my dress
sense isn't great.

1121
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:26,110
But you'll be accusing
me if you call me simple.

1122
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,610
Oh really?
Okay then prove otherwise.

1123
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:31,360
I've been expelled
from college, twice.

1124
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:35,110
People still talk about
me at Banaras University Campus.

1125
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:37,530
I had to shoulder a lot of
responsibilities at a young age..

1126
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:39,730
..hence I had to finish
college and take up a job.

1127
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:42,780
When one has to shoulder
responsibilities at a young age..

1128
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,780
... he might look fine from outside...

1129
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,730
... but he comes a little
hollow from inside.

1130
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:59,110
When I see you, I always ask myself...

1131
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:01,530
How can someone be
so complete in oneself?

1132
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:10,360
To see you breathe also seems
like an achievement in itself.

1133
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:17,280
You hardly know me.

1134
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:21,280
I believe that you can
never completely know a person.

1135
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:24,940
Because it's human nature to change.

1136
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,780
Change is the only constant.

1137
01:17:30,990 --> 01:17:33,940
I believe that you shouldn't
try to understand relationships.

1138
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:36,030
You should just be true to them.

1139
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:40,210
I agree that you can never
completely understand anyone.

1140
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:42,280
But you can at least
try to know a person.

1141
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,730
Who am I? What is my nature?

1142
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:46,980
Do I have a character flaw?

1143
01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:51,690
I believe that I am a very
progressive kind of a person.

1144
01:17:52,570 --> 01:17:56,110
Yes, even I would want my
partner to be loyal after marriage.

1145
01:17:56,980 --> 01:18:01,280
But if you had any boyfriends
or if you still do..

1146
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:03,650
... then that won't make
any difference to me.

1147
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,780
Having boyfriends
isn't a character flaw.

1148
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:09,650
To have boyfriends is a talent.

1149
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:13,030
I am talking about
real character flaws.

1150
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,190
Bad habits?

1151
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,250
What do you mean?

1152
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:21,440
I mean...

1153
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:24,780
How do I tell you?
Try taking a guess.

1154
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:28,360
Tell me.

1155
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:32,610
I think...

1156
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:35,860
I... I'm nervous.

1157
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,730
Look straight ahead.

1158
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:46,110
Okay.

1159
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:49,150
I'm going to tell you, okay? - Okay.

1160
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:52,650
I'm addicted to gambling and stealing.

1161
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:08,150
You are so funny!

1162
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:15,320
What did you say?
Addicted to gambling and stealing.

1163
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:17,690
You have a great sense of humor.

1164
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:01,190
How are you today?

1165
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,190
Okay.

1166
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,480
Oh, my God!

1167
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:29,110
Oh, my God!

1168
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,820
John! John! Oh, my God! Are you okay?

1169
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:38,060
I'll get a refill for your inhaler.

1170
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:41,150
Please.

1171
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:52,390
I'm... a single parent. Please don't...
- It's okay. I can go to another bank.

1172
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:10,620
'She was about 5'6'',
5'7", olive skin, purple hair.'

1173
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:12,730
'She even gave me her name in fact.'

1174
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:14,530
'What name did she give?'

1175
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:17,110
'I think Simran.'

1176
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,320
'Simran it was.'

1177
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:22,150
'Meanwhile at J&R Federal
Bank near Griffin Georgia.'

1178
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:25,440
'A teller has been rushed
to the county hospital.'

1179
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:30,580
'The threat of Simran, the lipstick
bandit rendered him unconscious.'

1180
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:33,880
'While not critical,
he's currently under observation.'

1181
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:38,090
'And we await updates from
the hospital on his condition.'

1182
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:09,610
Hello, Mr.Bugs?

1183
01:22:09,730 --> 01:22:10,980
Hey, hey!

1184
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:12,940
I'm glad I didn't have to remind you.

1185
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:14,980
You wouldn't have liked that.

1186
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,980
Where can I come with your money?

1187
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:19,230
I'll come to you, baby.

1188
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:22,230
Bugs will go anywhere for his 50,000.

1189
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:27,650
I am falling short of eight thousand.
- No-no-no-no.

1190
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:32,690
You don't wanna do that.
I need all my money.

1191
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,320
Then I need two more days!

1192
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:38,320
Listen! - Two more days!
Please? Please.

1193
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:47,960
Did I disturb your makeup session?

1194
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:49,290
What's the hurry?

1195
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,710
Your shift began an hour ago.

1196
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,330
Everyone else is here to do your work.

1197
01:22:54,650 --> 01:22:56,040
Shall I send anything for you?

1198
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:57,620
Green tea, juice?

1199
01:22:57,790 --> 01:22:58,790
What do you want?

1200
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,080
Go and get juice.

1201
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,500
Don't use your sarcasm on me, Mike!

1202
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:05,620
Lower your voice when you speak to me.

1203
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,460
And you don't act so bossy!

1204
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:10,330
I work for the hotel industry.
Not for you!

1205
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:30,080
Praful!

1206
01:23:31,370 --> 01:23:33,610
Sameer! - You know,
I was just thinking about you!

1207
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,080
What are you doing over here?

1208
01:23:35,170 --> 01:23:36,580
I'd come to withdraw some cash.

1209
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:37,580
And you?

1210
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:39,170
I was...

1211
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:40,830
...Preparing to rob the bank.

1212
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,330
Are you prepared?

1213
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,420
You are so funny.

1214
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:48,040
Come on, rob the bank later.

1215
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:49,330
I'll treat you with
a nice cup of coffee first.

1216
01:23:49,510 --> 01:23:52,040
No, I...I am getting late.
I have to leave.

1217
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:53,540
Five minutes. Just five minutes.

1218
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:54,580
Come on.

1219
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,830
Would you like to
see my favorite place?

1220
01:24:18,710 --> 01:24:20,040
Weren't you getting late?

1221
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:21,580
So what?

1222
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:24,460
I'll do 15 minutes
extra overtime. Just for you.

1223
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:27,710
Whatever you say!

1224
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:43,330
How did you like this place?

1225
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:44,750
It's very beautiful.

1226
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,290
Do you come here alone?

1227
01:24:47,630 --> 01:24:48,540
Yes.

1228
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:50,290
You mean all alone?

1229
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:52,920
What else does alone mean?

1230
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,080
I mean this place is so quiet.

1231
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,040
And you aren't one of
those who can keep quiet.

1232
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:00,080
What do you do here?

1233
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:02,620
That's a secret.

1234
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:06,120
If you find out, you'd lose your life.

1235
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:10,040
But I have seen the place.

1236
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:11,870
So I've lost half my life?

1237
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:14,440
What will I do with the other half?

1238
01:25:15,170 --> 01:25:16,170
You might as well take that too.

1239
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:17,960
Come here.

1240
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:29,040
Breathe the fresh air. Feel it.

1241
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:38,040
This air is totally free.

1242
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:41,500
No building can stop it.

1243
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:43,370
No obstacle can bind it.

1244
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:48,870
When I come here,...

1245
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:55,910
... I feel tiny wings sprouting out...

1246
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:58,210
... like that of a butterfly...

1247
01:25:59,510 --> 01:26:01,370
And then they start flapping.

1248
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:04,040
Can you see my wings?

1249
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:05,750
Yes.

1250
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:07,170
They are big.

1251
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:11,650
I flap them and then I fly away!

1252
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:18,820
Don't jog.
People come here only to fly.

1253
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:42,290
"It's like my blank
heart found poetry."

1254
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:52,020
"It's like love has showered
like rain for the first time."

1255
01:26:53,570 --> 01:26:58,130
"What I looked for in every eye.."

1256
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:03,100
"I found that loyalty in you."

1257
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:08,500
"You are my life."

1258
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:11,800
"I know that."

1259
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:16,500
"You are my companion."

1260
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:21,550
"You are my love."

1261
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:26,550
"The one my lips cannot stop singing..."

1262
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:31,460
"You are that song for me."

1263
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:34,750
Authorities are working diligently
to identify this female suspect.

1264
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:36,580
We are trying to determine
if she is working alone..

1265
01:27:36,670 --> 01:27:39,170
..or if she is a part of
a larger organized crime syndicate.

1266
01:27:39,670 --> 01:27:40,790
The public needs to be aware.

1267
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:43,830
This suspect is considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

1268
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:47,370
Witnesses have reported she's wearing
a jacket equipped with explosives.

1269
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:21,560
"You are my companion."

1270
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:26,520
"You are my love."

1271
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:31,670
"The one my lips cannot stop singing..."

1272
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:36,530
"You are that song for me."

1273
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:41,580
"You are my companion."

1274
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:46,570
"You are my love."

1275
01:28:46,990 --> 01:28:51,490
"The one my lips cannot stop singing..."

1276
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:56,660
"You are that song for me."

1277
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:02,930
"You are my companion."

1278
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:24,500
Where is my money?
Where's my money, huh?

1279
01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:26,240
Get up!

1280
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:31,420
Where is it?

1281
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:33,000
I told you I'd come for my money

1282
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:34,470
Oh, my God!
- I told you!

1283
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:35,710
Security!

1284
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:37,890
Where is my money?
Where is it?

1285
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,170
Where is my money!

1286
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:40,710
I told you I'd come for my money.

1287
01:29:40,830 --> 01:29:42,670
Where is my money!
- Who the hell are you?

1288
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:44,290
No, this bitch owes me money!
- Stand down!

1289
01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:46,290
She ran away with 50,000
dollars of my money!

1290
01:29:46,370 --> 01:29:47,870
This is our personal matter!

1291
01:29:47,950 --> 01:29:49,290
This is our personal matter...

1292
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,290
I'll meet you outside my house...

1293
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:53,580
With your money...

1294
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:55,150
Please?

1295
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,500
You cannot bring your
personal matters here.

1296
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:11,870
I have to report to the manager.

1297
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:33,870
But nothing like this happened
from my end in last seven years.

1298
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:35,830
Please don't suspend me.

1299
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:38,670
If you do not vacate
the premises immediately...

1300
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:40,870
Forget suspension, I will sack you.

1301
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:44,330
Sir...
- Now, to be clear, one last time..

1302
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:48,620
You are suspended without
pay for three months.

1303
01:30:48,950 --> 01:30:50,210
And you should consider
yourself lucky.

1304
01:30:50,290 --> 01:30:53,500
For anyone else,
I would've not been so lenient.

1305
01:30:54,210 --> 01:30:55,830
Sir, please...
- Ms. Patel!

1306
01:30:56,170 --> 01:30:59,250
The next step is I call security,
do you understand?

1307
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:29,420
Praful! What happened, Praful?

1308
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:31,040
Is something missing?
- Where is my money?

1309
01:31:31,170 --> 01:31:33,080
We didn't touch it.
- Where is my money?

1310
01:31:33,210 --> 01:31:34,210
Which money, Praful?

1311
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:36,540
I'd kept some money here. Here...

1312
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:37,870
Who...
- Which money?

1313
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:39,290
Who opened my locker?!

1314
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,960
We don't have the key to your locker.

1315
01:31:42,290 --> 01:31:44,000
Only admin has the master keys.

1316
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,960
No one can get anything
without Mike's sanction.

1317
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,520
Mike... yes, Mike.

1318
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:50,330
Mike...
- Praful!

1319
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:54,120
Mike, where is my money?

1320
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,750
You don't enter a
manager's office without...

1321
01:31:56,830 --> 01:31:58,330
Where is my money?!

1322
01:31:58,710 --> 01:31:59,830
Which money?

1323
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:01,330
The money you stole?

1324
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:04,170
Mike!
Mike, I am going to kill you!

1325
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:05,960
Mike...Mike give my money.

1326
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:07,540
Give my money!
- You b*tch!

1327
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:12,080
Mike!
- Oh shit!

1328
01:32:13,290 --> 01:32:15,120
Hey! Security!

1329
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:18,830
Mike, give my money!
- Hey! Somebody help!

1330
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:20,080
Give my money!

1331
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:24,250
Security!
- Give my money! Give my money!

1332
01:32:24,370 --> 01:32:25,580
Security!

1333
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:29,500
Send somebody here, quick!

1334
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:31,520
Give me my money!
- Get off!

1335
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:35,500
Mike! Mike! Give my money!
- Get her out!

1336
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:36,760
Mike, give my money!

1337
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:38,290
Leave me, Leave me! - If she
comes back I'll have her arrested.

1338
01:32:38,370 --> 01:32:41,250
Mike, give my money! Mike! Mike!

1339
01:32:41,870 --> 01:32:45,460
Leave me, leave me!
Okay, leave me, I'll go on my own!

1340
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,250
Praful!

1341
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:12,840
Thank you.

1342
01:33:14,210 --> 01:33:15,460
Thank you.

1343
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,460
Try this 'Ghatiya'
from Rajkot. - Okay.

1344
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:22,210
It's a very tasty snack.
- It's special.

1345
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:23,460
Very nice.

1346
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:28,420
Hello, dear.

1347
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:29,870
Hard day's work?

1348
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:38,120
She works very hard.

1349
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,750
She gets tired, poor girl.

1350
01:34:40,410 --> 01:34:41,500
Praful!

1351
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:43,000
Freshen up and come out.

1352
01:34:45,710 --> 01:34:48,790
Mohan, the kids have
made their decision.

1353
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:50,290
What should we do next?

1354
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:52,750
Whatever you think is fine.

1355
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:57,250
I'll call up the priest at Nathdwara and
ask him to suggest an auspicious hour.

1356
01:34:57,370 --> 01:34:59,080
If they want an engagement
then we'll get them engaged...

1357
01:34:59,210 --> 01:35:00,370
... or else get them married.

1358
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:03,250
No, sister. I'd suggest
we get them married immediately.

1359
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:06,500
What do you say? - Uncle,
I wanted to say something to you.

1360
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:10,040
Actually, I've got into
UC Davies university. - Okay.

1361
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:12,710
It's one of the good
universities in California.

1362
01:35:13,710 --> 01:35:15,750
We will have to shift
there after our marriage.

1363
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:17,080
I have spoken to Praful.

1364
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:19,580
She'll try if she can
get her job transferred there.

1365
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,580
We just need your permission.

1366
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:25,620
No problem.
Daughters are meant to be sent away.

1367
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:26,960
She's all yours!

1368
01:35:28,670 --> 01:35:29,920
On that note,
try the 'Gulab Jamuns' (sweets).

1369
01:35:38,790 --> 01:35:40,040
I am coming out.

1370
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,500
12th is a Friday.
- Check when's the full moon day.

1371
01:35:44,710 --> 01:35:46,960
Full moon day, I think 20th or 21st.
- Full moon day will be an auspicious day.

1372
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:50,870
We'll also have to talk to Kaushal.

1373
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:21,040
I had the money! Somebody stole it!

1374
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:22,870
No more lies b*tch!

1375
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:25,330
She is not lying. She had the money.

1376
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:29,080
Isn't that right, Simran?
You had the money.

1377
01:36:29,170 --> 01:36:30,290
Simran?

1378
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:32,960
You called us after every heist.

1379
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:35,870
I thought she was dumb, Bugs.

1380
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:40,040
She's smart. She is very very smart.

1381
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:44,370
Far too talented to be
wasting her life cleaning rooms.

1382
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,830
You think she can work with us?

1383
01:36:53,830 --> 01:36:55,170
You're vicious.

1384
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:59,040
Join us, make millions.

1385
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,830
I don't want to make millions.

1386
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
I just want to return your money.

1387
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:08,750
Then stop using lipstick
notes and start using this.

1388
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,670
Get it all in one go.

1389
01:37:13,670 --> 01:37:16,170
Be our Robin Hood.
- Hell ya!

1390
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:19,000
Robin Hood?
- Robin Hood.

1391
01:37:19,210 --> 01:37:23,250
You rob from the rich...and
help us poor people out.

1392
01:37:26,350 --> 01:37:30,500
'Coz you outta options baby,
the cops are onto you.

1393
01:37:43,710 --> 01:37:45,210
I will get your money.

1394
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,250
Who were those people?

1395
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:01,710
Who were they?

1396
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:02,960
How does that concern you?

1397
01:38:03,710 --> 01:38:06,000
What is wrong with you?
Why are you talking like this?

1398
01:38:06,620 --> 01:38:08,080
I just asked who were those people?

1399
01:38:08,230 --> 01:38:10,420
Just because we smiled,
laughed together for a few days..

1400
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:12,040
.. you started
owning me?

1401
01:38:12,570 --> 01:38:13,830
What do you mean?

1402
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:16,170
We are going to get married, Praful.

1403
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:18,730
So it is important that we
know everything about each other.

1404
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:21,290
You want to know everything?

1405
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:23,250
Those guys were my friends.

1406
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:27,040
When I lost all my money gambling,
they gave me a loan.

1407
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:29,790
And I started robbing
banks to repay that loan.

1408
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:31,040
Sameer!

1409
01:38:31,210 --> 01:38:32,790
Auntie is asking what will you have?

1410
01:38:32,870 --> 01:38:34,170
'Gulam Jamun' or
'Raas Malia' (sweets)?

1411
01:38:34,370 --> 01:38:35,290
They are both fresh.

1412
01:38:35,670 --> 01:38:36,960
Give me a minute, uncle.

1413
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:41,790
What?

1414
01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:47,460
Got scared, Sameer?

1415
01:38:49,910 --> 01:38:51,170
How much do you owe them?

1416
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:52,670
50,000 dollars.

1417
01:38:53,790 --> 01:38:55,710
That's your MBA fees.

1418
01:38:55,850 --> 01:38:57,870
What happened Sameer,
why did you run away?

1419
01:38:58,040 --> 01:38:59,330
Sameer?

1420
01:39:00,010 --> 01:39:02,080
Let me finish, Sameer!

1421
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:05,580
After that the stolen
money got stolen.

1422
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:07,420
Let's go, uncle.

1423
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:08,580
Where?
- Please let's just go.

1424
01:39:08,790 --> 01:39:10,250
Where do you want to go?
- Let's go, please.

1425
01:39:10,370 --> 01:39:12,000
What happened?
What...? At least tell me.

1426
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,080
Come with me, please.

1427
01:39:13,210 --> 01:39:14,810
Come on.
- What happened? Say something.

1428
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:16,040
Bye, auntie.

1429
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:17,710
Bye, uncle.

1430
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:20,250
Bye, Sameer.

1431
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:22,080
Hope to never see you again.

1432
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:38,080
Why did they leave?

1433
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:40,210
They didn't leave, papa.
I made them leave, papa.

1434
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,830
What do you mean?
Why did you make them leave?

1435
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:45,080
We were preparing
for your wedding, Praful!

1436
01:39:45,170 --> 01:39:46,170
I don't want to get married.

1437
01:39:46,340 --> 01:39:48,880
Why did you say yes to
him if you didn't want to get married?

1438
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,880
Like I had said yes, I'm saying no!

1439
01:39:51,790 --> 01:39:53,080
Mohan!
- Papa!

1440
01:39:53,170 --> 01:39:54,710
No, don't!
- Praful!

1441
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:58,460
You will raise your hand on me?

1442
01:39:58,710 --> 01:39:59,540
Come, hit me.

1443
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:01,040
Do it.

1444
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:05,330
Get out of my house. Now!

1445
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:07,420
Praful! - Get out
of my house right now!

1446
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:10,460
Praful! - Go!
It doesn't make any difference to me.

1447
01:40:12,130 --> 01:40:14,420
Praful...
- Let her go. I don't care!

1448
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:16,170
Calm down, Mohan! - Get out!

1449
01:40:19,170 --> 01:40:23,920
"Pour down..."
- What are you doing, Praful?

1450
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:25,620
What are you doing?

1451
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:30,040
"Come and drench me."
- Why are you packing your bag?

1452
01:40:30,130 --> 01:40:31,790
Mohan?
She is leaving.

1453
01:40:31,870 --> 01:40:35,130
"Pour down..."

1454
01:40:35,210 --> 01:40:38,210
- Praful... Don't take
what your father said to your heart.

1455
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:42,580
"Come and drench me."
- He only wants what's the best for you.

1456
01:40:56,190 --> 01:41:02,420
"Pour down..."

1457
01:41:03,690 --> 01:41:09,260
"Come and drench me."

1458
01:41:09,870 --> 01:41:15,100
"Pour down..."

1459
01:41:16,340 --> 01:41:21,920
"Come and drench me."

1460
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:44,630
Hello, Salma? Can I ask for a favor?

1461
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:48,710
Can I stay with you for tonight?
Just for tonight.

1462
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:52,670
Okay thank you, thank you.

1463
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:23,880
Hey, Lipstick Bandit!

1464
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:27,250
I am coming to Vegas
with your money tomorrow.

1465
01:42:27,380 --> 01:42:30,250
I am waiting for you
with baited breath, my love!

1466
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:33,630
I don't have a place to stay.
Can you...

1467
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:35,330
Oh, I can arrange a new name,...

1468
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:39,670
... a new place, a new identity...

1469
01:42:39,790 --> 01:42:42,790
How do you like the name... Shakira?

1470
01:42:52,930 --> 01:42:57,820
"By the sand on the shore..."

1471
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:04,920
"Lie still my footprints."

1472
01:43:05,570 --> 01:43:11,520
"It caressed them and went away..."

1473
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:16,720
"It gave a hug and then flowed away."

1474
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:20,080
"Your unhurried course..."

1475
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:23,810
"Your minuscule stillness...

1476
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:29,150
"You are...you are the one, my love."

1477
01:43:29,230 --> 01:43:32,130
"Oh wave, stay back."

1478
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:35,870
"Stay back."

1479
01:43:36,590 --> 01:43:41,810
"Or let me drown myself in you."

1480
01:43:42,770 --> 01:43:45,830
"Stay back."

1481
01:43:45,910 --> 01:43:48,770
"Stay back, please."

1482
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:54,880
"Or let me drown,
yes please let drown."

1483
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,290
Yes? Can I help you?

1484
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:21,750
Do we have an appointment?

1485
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:22,840
Oh dear lord!

1486
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:25,330
Oh, my God.

1487
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:26,670
What are you doing?

1488
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:28,250
You don't have to do this.

1489
01:44:28,330 --> 01:44:30,830
You just tell me
what I can do for you.

1490
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:33,080
Do you remember me?

1491
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:38,130
You said people like me don't borrow,
we steal.

1492
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:40,500
So here I am to steal.
Move!

1493
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,830
I'm sorry, if I said that.
That's not what I meant.

1494
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:48,130
Take me to the cashier!

1495
01:44:54,290 --> 01:44:55,670
Nobody move!

1496
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:57,880
Ask him to put all the money in this.

1497
01:45:01,170 --> 01:45:01,680
Hurry!

1498
01:45:14,170 --> 01:45:15,130
How much is this?

1499
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:18,130
Around 90,000 dollars.
- Just give it to her.

1500
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:47,420
Hello?

1501
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:50,830
There is a transaction
in my account right now.

1502
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:53,710
I want to reverse the transaction.
How to do it?

1503
01:45:57,630 --> 01:45:59,920
I... I cannot come to the bank. I...

1504
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:04,670
I am not here on Monday!

1505
01:46:05,130 --> 01:46:06,960
No, he cannot...he can also not...

1506
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:14,880
Hello? Praful?

1507
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,580
You gave my account number to Sameer?

1508
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:20,830
Yes.
Sameer had called up.

1509
01:46:21,170 --> 01:46:24,130
Your father asked him why
he needs your account number.

1510
01:46:24,710 --> 01:46:26,130
But he didn't say anything.

1511
01:46:26,210 --> 01:46:28,960
Why did you give him my account
number without my permission?

1512
01:46:29,170 --> 01:46:30,330
What's going on, Praful?

1513
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:32,210
I just don't understand anything.

1514
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,580
You are upset with your father, right?

1515
01:46:35,130 --> 01:46:36,540
Why are you upset with me?

1516
01:46:37,130 --> 01:46:39,540
Where are you?
- I'm leaving the city.

1517
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:41,170
You're leaving?

1518
01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:44,130
Praful, you should have at least...

1519
01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:46,290
Praful?

1520
01:46:55,330 --> 01:46:57,210
I want to meet you right now!

1521
01:47:21,290 --> 01:47:23,380
You transferred 50,000
dollars into my account?

1522
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,500
That was the money
meant for your studies, right?

1523
01:47:29,780 --> 01:47:30,830
What are you trying to do?

1524
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:32,420
You think you're a saint?

1525
01:47:32,670 --> 01:47:34,920
I don't want any favors.

1526
01:47:35,270 --> 01:47:37,790
Favors are given when
someone expects something in return.

1527
01:47:39,710 --> 01:47:41,000
I don't expect anything in return.

1528
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:43,250
And I am not trying to be a saint.

1529
01:47:44,290 --> 01:47:45,630
I did what I thought was right.

1530
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:47,460
And you should do
what you think is right.

1531
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:53,380
Sameer!

1532
01:48:02,690 --> 01:48:03,580
What are you doing?

1533
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:05,960
You are a very nice guy.

1534
01:48:07,010 --> 01:48:08,960
Don't get involved
with a girl like me.

1535
01:48:09,170 --> 01:48:10,330
You will get into trouble.

1536
01:48:11,260 --> 01:48:12,880
I wish you all the best.

1537
01:48:13,540 --> 01:48:14,670
Have a nice life.

1538
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:20,260
I think you should surrender.

1539
01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:01,460
What is it, mummy?

1540
01:49:01,580 --> 01:49:03,630
Where are you going?

1541
01:49:08,130 --> 01:49:10,250
Cat got your tongue now?

1542
01:49:14,670 --> 01:49:19,480
Apologizing to your family, to your
elders, will it make you any smaller?

1543
01:49:23,270 --> 01:49:26,940
- Praful...Praful, listen...!

1544
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,930
She refuses to understand!

1545
01:49:57,170 --> 01:49:59,500
I had rejected her loan application.

1546
01:49:59,990 --> 01:50:01,580
She asked me if I remembered her.

1547
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:03,420
And I... I couldn't place her.

1548
01:50:04,270 --> 01:50:07,920
Praful? - Then she said that
I suggested that she steal.

1549
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:10,050
I'm just a bank employee.

1550
01:50:10,130 --> 01:50:12,580
We can't go distributing
money to everyone who asks for it.

1551
01:50:12,710 --> 01:50:14,710
There are rules.
- Yes, of course there are.

1552
01:50:14,830 --> 01:50:16,000
You've done nothing wrong.

1553
01:50:16,290 --> 01:50:17,880
Copy that.
Excuse me, ma'am.

1554
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:47,250
Come on guys,
you didn't have to do it here.

1555
01:52:47,330 --> 01:52:48,920
I would've come to the station.

1556
01:52:49,890 --> 01:52:51,130
Everybody's watching.

1557
01:52:52,150 --> 01:52:54,290
Come on! Not so tight! This is...

1558
01:53:04,170 --> 01:53:05,170
Stop here.

1559
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:06,670
On this side. Here.

1560
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:08,330
Here?
- Yes.

1561
01:53:31,120 --> 01:53:32,080
Thank you.

1562
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:52,670
Hello, police helpline?

1563
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:54,830
No, no, no I don't need help.

1564
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:56,130
I want to help you.

1565
01:53:56,250 --> 01:53:58,960
You are looking for Simran,
The Lipstick Bandit?

1566
01:54:15,250 --> 01:54:16,040
Don't shoot!

1567
01:54:16,130 --> 01:54:17,210
Are you Simran?

1568
01:54:18,510 --> 01:54:20,630
The Lipstick Bandit?
Are you Simran?

1569
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:22,580
Keep your hands up.

1570
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:25,000
Keep your hands up.

1571
01:54:26,630 --> 01:54:27,540
Are you strapped?

1572
01:54:27,670 --> 01:54:30,000
No, no.
- Do you have a weapon?

1573
01:54:30,330 --> 01:54:32,670
Yes.
- Okay slowly...

1574
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:35,380
Slowly put the weapon on the ground.

1575
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:37,080
On the ground.

1576
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:40,500
Hands in the air.

1577
01:54:41,130 --> 01:54:42,000
Do not move.

1578
01:54:42,130 --> 01:54:43,170
Stand still.

1579
01:54:46,710 --> 01:54:47,750
Stand still.

1580
01:54:55,540 --> 01:54:56,670
You are the Lipstick Bandit?

1581
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Yes.

1582
01:54:58,160 --> 01:54:59,380
I have the money... - Stop.

1583
01:54:59,860 --> 01:55:01,000
Don't touch anything.

1584
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:06,250
Why run if you are going to surrender?

1585
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:09,290
Because that neighborhood
is full of Indians!

1586
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:11,130
All my relatives live there.

1587
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:14,290
If my father sees me getting arrested,
he will kill me.

1588
01:55:14,630 --> 01:55:16,920
Let's go or he will find us.

1589
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:19,630
Are you serious?

1590
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:21,500
Let's go.

1591
01:55:21,690 --> 01:55:22,580
Let's go.

1592
01:56:10,710 --> 01:56:12,830
Mummy, you should bring
more 'Dhokla' (snacks).

1593
01:56:13,210 --> 01:56:15,080
I'm keeping the 'Khakra'
(snacks) for my friends.

1594
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:17,420
Eat to your heart's content, dear.

1595
01:56:18,160 --> 01:56:19,920
And what are these
friends have you made here?

1596
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:22,000
You better stay away
from bad company.

1597
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:24,920
Cool down. Calm down. Eat peacefully.

1598
01:56:25,630 --> 01:56:27,170
There are only four months left, dear.

1599
01:56:27,250 --> 01:56:28,330
You've already spent six months here.

1600
01:56:28,750 --> 01:56:30,000
These four months too shall pass.

1601
01:56:30,810 --> 01:56:34,420
When you get out of here,
forget the past and start afresh.

1602
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:38,790
I have decided that you'll
be a partner in my business.

1603
01:56:39,210 --> 01:56:40,210
You should start working in the shop.

1604
01:56:40,580 --> 01:56:43,000
Anyway, what's mine is yours.

1605
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:46,000
Papa, you don't have
to worry about anything.

1606
01:56:46,210 --> 01:56:47,960
I have planned everything.

1607
01:56:48,510 --> 01:56:49,710
You have become old.

1608
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:54,210
We will sell your shop and
invest all your money in stocks.

1609
01:56:55,150 --> 01:56:56,750
I have made a friend, Sue.

1610
01:56:56,920 --> 01:56:59,670
Her bad luck that she got busted.

1611
01:57:00,040 --> 01:57:02,960
Mummy, I tell you,
she's a stock market genius.

1612
01:57:06,330 --> 01:57:07,250
What did you say?

1613
01:57:13,490 --> 01:57:15,280
I won't spare you!
- Mohan! Let her go!

1614
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:15,640
Hi, I'm Maniben.

1615
01:58:16,410 --> 01:58:19,250
Hi, I'm Maniben.

1616
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:21,660
Hi, I'm Maniben.

1617
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:23,460
Shakuntala Kanta's
elder sister insane.

1618
01:58:23,540 --> 01:58:25,260
Get married said my dad...

1619
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:27,180
Or your grandma will
be on the deathbed.

1620
01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:30,930
Get married. Get married. Get married.

1621
01:58:31,010 --> 01:58:33,120
Don't they have anything else to do?

1622
01:58:34,330 --> 01:58:35,910
Diwali's gone, Holi's here.

1623
01:58:35,990 --> 01:58:37,960
Diwali's gone, Holi's here.

1624
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:41,750
Postpone my marriage,
I told my family here.

1625
01:58:41,830 --> 01:58:45,000
I want to stay single!
Let me stay single.

1626
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:48,660
Papa, I want to stay single!
Let me stay single.

1627
01:58:48,740 --> 01:58:52,290
I'll make you Dhokla.
Let me stay single.

1628
01:58:52,370 --> 01:58:55,920
I'll make you tea. Let me stay single.

1629
01:58:59,370 --> 01:59:02,580
Fun-filled life!

1630
01:59:02,850 --> 01:59:05,410
Fun-filled life!

1631
01:59:06,570 --> 01:59:07,610
Fun-filled life!

1632
01:59:07,690 --> 01:59:10,660
Dance, cutie!

Fun-filled life!

1638
01:59:28,330 --> 01:59:32,700
You get multiple useless
proposals in a week.

1639
01:59:32,780 --> 01:59:36,370
Like cheaper by the
deal in a mall you seek.

1640
01:59:36,450 --> 01:59:39,990
In the end, you will find
a one in a million whacko for me.

1641
01:59:40,070 --> 01:59:43,500
Then without my consent,
you will get him married to me.

1642
01:59:43,580 --> 01:59:46,840
Forget it. Papa, forget it.

1643
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:50,500
I am happy. Let me stay happy.

1644
01:59:50,900 --> 01:59:54,440
I want to stay single!
Let me stay single.

1645
01:59:54,590 --> 01:59:58,120
Let me share the secret
of a happy life with everyone!

02:00:04,830 --> 02:00:06,410
