1
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,335
The tune..

2
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,947
You remember the tune?

3
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:26,050
Hey baby. I'm on the way.

4
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,347
Shall we meet directly
at the restaurant?

5
00:04:28,557 --> 00:04:31,503
Sanjana, I am sorry. We'll have
to cancel today's dinner plan.

6
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:33,597
I have an important meeting
with a client.

7
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:35,097
I can't miss it.

8
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:37,389
Baby, it's my birthday.

9
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:39,800
We can at least
have dinner together.

10
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,345
Sanjana, we can celebrate
your birthday tomorrow.

11
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,721
This meeting is important.

12
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,411
I really need to go.
I'll see you at home.

13
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,074
And yeah.. Happy birthday.

14
00:04:51,493 --> 00:04:53,252
Happy birthday to me.

15
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:54,587
Happy birthday!

16
00:05:54,717 --> 00:05:57,911
Surprise!
- Anu! Oh my, God!

17
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:03,190
"Happy birthday to you!"

18
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,778
"Happy birthday to you!"

19
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:10,837
"Happy birthday, dear Sanjana."

20
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:14,795
"Happy birthday to you!"
- Thank you.

21
00:06:18,281 --> 00:06:20,757
Thank you so much, Anu.
It's so sweet of you.

22
00:06:20,887 --> 00:06:23,593
Don't thank me,
thank your husband.

23
00:06:23,723 --> 00:06:26,014
He's organized all this.

24
00:06:26,263 --> 00:06:27,431
Kabir?

25
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:31,431
But he's busy with some client..
- He knew he'll be late.

26
00:06:31,695 --> 00:06:33,884
That's why
he organized this party

27
00:06:34,014 --> 00:06:36,347
and called us all here.

28
00:06:37,342 --> 00:06:40,930
Come on. Cut the cake before
your birthday gets over.

29
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,560
Cut my birthday cake
without Kabir?

30
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:45,421
Never.

31
00:06:45,551 --> 00:06:51,222
Sanjana! It's hard to say
who loves whom the most?

32
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,175
You both are mad.
Absolutely crazy.

33
00:06:55,484 --> 00:06:58,950
Honestly, you two
make me really jealous.

34
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:03,884
By the way, Sanju,
meet my cousin Chitra.

35
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:05,732
Hi.
- Happy birthday.

36
00:07:05,862 --> 00:07:06,675
Thank you.

37
00:07:06,805 --> 00:07:09,880
I am sorry for coming
here uninvited..

38
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:10,998
Are you mad?

39
00:07:11,128 --> 00:07:12,648
You're most welcome.
- Thank you.

40
00:07:12,778 --> 00:07:16,514
Sanju, she's an expert
tarot card reader.

41
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,888
If there's anything you want
to know anything about yourself.

42
00:07:20,184 --> 00:07:21,347
Here she is.

43
00:07:21,477 --> 00:07:23,888
She knows everything.

44
00:07:24,018 --> 00:07:27,051
I hope you don't mind.
I don't believe in these things.

45
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:30,160
Why learn about
yourself from others?

46
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:32,492
And I've got everything.
And I'm doing good.

47
00:07:32,622 --> 00:07:34,117
Of course you are.

48
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:36,320
But don't you want to know

49
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,442
whether you'll have
the fortune forever?

50
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:50,544
You always end up losing

51
00:07:50,674 --> 00:07:54,818
everyone you love
or is close to your heart.

52
00:07:56,272 --> 00:07:58,188
Do you agree?

53
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,790
Right or wrong?

54
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:06,122
A bit of both.

55
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:19,296
Have you lost something?

56
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:25,323
Strange, because

57
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:27,914
this card indicates that

58
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:33,706
you're going to find
what you lost.

59
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:36,877
Maybe someone's coming back.

60
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:25,473
"The moon's missing
from the sky."

61
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:34,336
"And descended in my home."

62
00:09:35,978 --> 00:09:41,243
"I am so fortunate"

63
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:52,166
"like my wish has
been fulfilled."

64
00:09:53,779 --> 00:10:02,543
"My love, I can't live
a moment without you."

65
00:10:02,948 --> 00:10:10,110
"Desire to have you
has made me crazy."

66
00:10:36,531 --> 00:10:39,747
Kabir, I want us
to spend time together.

67
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:41,997
I've told you
a thousand times before.

68
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,122
I don't want nothing
and no one between us.

69
00:10:44,663 --> 00:10:45,830
Just you and me.

70
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,103
But you can't live with me.

71
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:50,411
There's always some surprise,
or party or people..

72
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,206
And then there's your career,
your meetings, your job.

73
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:55,830
Sanjana, you wanted
to flee from Kerala, right?

74
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:57,243
You wanted to come here.

75
00:10:57,373 --> 00:11:00,956
To start a new life.
A better life, better lifestyle.

76
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:03,789
Isn't that what we
needed to be happy, right?

77
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:07,909
But for that, one has to work,
stay apart for a while.

78
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,756
I don't want to stay apart.

79
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,133
I don't want this.

80
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:15,289
I just want you.

81
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,709
Your time, your company.

82
00:11:18,747 --> 00:11:20,331
Am I asking for too much?

83
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:23,867
Fleeing from Kerala didn't
mean that we grow apart too.

84
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:25,747
What do you want me
to do, Sanjana?

85
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,159
Quit my job and stay at home to
assure you nothing has changed.

86
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,297
Everything...
Everything is still the same.

87
00:11:32,694 --> 00:11:34,617
Or let's go to Kerala?
Would you like that?

88
00:11:34,747 --> 00:11:35,659
No.

89
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:38,243
The root of this problem is
this place. Let's just go back.

90
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:39,539
No.

91
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:46,242
Neither that city
nor that house.

92
00:11:48,873 --> 00:11:51,484
That place is littered
with Anjana's memories.

93
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:54,715
Everywhere.

94
00:11:56,437 --> 00:11:58,317
I won't go back to Kerala.

95
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,385
No.

96
00:12:09,665 --> 00:12:10,716
Hello.

97
00:12:16,996 --> 00:12:18,039
Okay.

98
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,289
What happened?

99
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,921
Mom's in the hospital.

100
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:28,309
We'll have to go to Kerala.

101
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:53,103
You okay?

102
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:56,987
Yes.

103
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,583
I cannot forgive myself.

104
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:08,956
I am really selfish,
right, Kabir?

105
00:13:09,294 --> 00:13:10,630
Not at all.

106
00:13:11,497 --> 00:13:12,956
Not at all.

107
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:19,122
If I hadn't insisted
for an operation

108
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:21,956
then Anjana would've been..
- Sanjana.

109
00:13:22,413 --> 00:13:24,566
It wasn't you,
it was the operation.

110
00:13:25,808 --> 00:13:27,808
No one wants
to be born like that.

111
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,626
No one wants a life like that.

112
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:34,333
It was an accident. A mishap.

113
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:37,424
Not selfishness.

114
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,576
Look, she suffered
a serious blow to her head.

115
00:14:27,706 --> 00:14:29,700
She's paralyzed neck down.

116
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,368
She can't speak or walk.

117
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:34,914
Also, there's a blood clot
in her brain.

118
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,317
We found it in her MRI scan.

119
00:14:38,331 --> 00:14:40,009
We may need to operate her.

120
00:14:42,084 --> 00:14:43,331
Thank you, Doctor.

121
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:47,473
Sanjana.

122
00:15:12,716 --> 00:15:14,072
Come on, Leo.

123
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:20,155
Yes, I'll take that.
Thank you. - Okay.

124
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:06,245
Shall we?
- Yes.

125
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:08,372
Five!

126
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:17,835
Anjana.

127
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:24,665
Sanjana?

128
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:32,631
Are you Mangala?

129
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:34,115
Yes, I..

130
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,534
How are you?

131
00:18:36,664 --> 00:18:38,956
I'm okay. And you?

132
00:18:39,178 --> 00:18:41,789
I am fine.

133
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,820
It's all right.
Some ups and downs.

134
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,593
How's madam?

135
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:51,539
She's being treated.

136
00:18:51,892 --> 00:18:53,456
It's serious.

137
00:18:57,681 --> 00:18:58,763
Who's she?

138
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:01,446
She's my daughter-in-law, Jaya.
- Hello.

139
00:19:01,576 --> 00:19:03,393
My son's biggest mistake.

140
00:19:04,165 --> 00:19:06,266
They got married
three months ago.

141
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:10,243
So I brought her here,
to work with me.

142
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:11,638
I see.

143
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:16,456
Do you know
what happened that day?

144
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:18,493
That accident?

145
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:20,700
I have no clue.

146
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,456
But there was a big storm
that night.

147
00:19:23,771 --> 00:19:26,034
It was such a fierce storm

148
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:28,700
that the ceiling
of the outhouse collapsed.

149
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,661
Madam was lying outside
the outhouse, unconscious.

150
00:19:33,533 --> 00:19:34,768
Outhouse?

151
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:46,878
Why do you always
keep it locked?

152
00:19:47,008 --> 00:19:47,992
Why don't you open it?

153
00:19:48,122 --> 00:19:49,747
How can we, sir?

154
00:19:50,235 --> 00:19:52,122
It's been closed
for seven years.

155
00:19:52,422 --> 00:19:54,493
I've been working here
since five years.

156
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,789
I asked madam once, and she said

157
00:19:58,143 --> 00:20:00,773
this was Sanjana
and Anjana's playroom.

158
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,894
After Anjana's death,
Sanjana locked this place.

159
00:20:04,446 --> 00:20:08,076
She said, this place is
filled with Anjana's memories.

160
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:10,456
Her toys, and..

161
00:20:12,248 --> 00:20:14,451
And Anjana too.
- Mother!

162
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,380
What nonsense! Anjana too!

163
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:18,242
Please open it.

164
00:20:18,372 --> 00:20:20,997
Sir..
- Get the key, please.

165
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,297
Thank you.
- Let's go.

166
00:24:46,872 --> 00:24:48,237
Who is it?

167
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:08,982
Kabir!
Oh, God! You scared me.

168
00:25:09,112 --> 00:25:09,969
And you amaze me.

169
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:11,827
What are you doing here
at 2 o'clock in the night?

170
00:25:11,957 --> 00:25:14,256
Kabir, I.. I heard some noises.

171
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:17,209
What noise? Are you crazy?

172
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:18,278
Really, Kabir.

173
00:25:18,408 --> 00:25:20,277
I heard some noises
and came to inspect.. - Sanjana.

174
00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:23,103
If there were any sounds,
I'd have heard them too, right?

175
00:25:23,434 --> 00:25:25,414
You didn't hear anything?
- No.

176
00:25:25,802 --> 00:25:27,369
Come on.
- Kabir, trust me.

177
00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:28,569
I heard some noises.

178
00:25:28,699 --> 00:25:29,870
It must be coming
from some other house.

179
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,736
Come on. Let's go back
to sleep, come on.

180
00:25:38,521 --> 00:25:39,451
Mr. Kabir.
- Yeah.

181
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:40,807
There have been
some complications.

182
00:25:40,937 --> 00:25:42,451
We need to operate
on her immediately.

183
00:25:42,581 --> 00:25:44,152
I think you should get her
as quick as you can.

184
00:25:44,282 --> 00:25:45,101
What?

185
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,535
'Paging for Sister Parvati.'

186
00:25:47,665 --> 00:25:50,034
'Sister Parvati please report
to ward 5.'

187
00:25:50,164 --> 00:25:53,824
'Sister Parvati please
report to ward 5.'

188
00:25:59,294 --> 00:26:00,575
Yes, Mohit, go ahead.

189
00:26:02,469 --> 00:26:03,373
What?

190
00:26:04,072 --> 00:26:06,028
No, Mohit,
you can't take a leave.

191
00:26:06,158 --> 00:26:07,164
Kabir!

192
00:26:09,456 --> 00:26:10,564
Sorry.

193
00:26:11,326 --> 00:26:12,367
Buddy..

194
00:26:12,497 --> 00:26:13,686
Mohit, firstly I am
not in the office.

195
00:26:13,816 --> 00:26:14,659
And now you want a leave too.

196
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:15,742
Those are very
important clients.

197
00:26:15,872 --> 00:26:17,623
Somebody has to be
there to handle them.

198
00:26:18,015 --> 00:26:19,860
Who will do it?

199
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,039
I don't know. I am stuck
in this goddamn place.

200
00:26:24,535 --> 00:26:26,076
Why did all the mothers have to
fall ill at the same time?

201
00:26:26,206 --> 00:26:27,503
I just don't understand..

202
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,039
I'll call you back.

203
00:26:35,296 --> 00:26:37,626
Sanjana, I am sorry.
I didn't mean that.

204
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,164
Sanjana.

205
00:26:55,078 --> 00:26:55,956
I am sorry.

206
00:26:56,554 --> 00:26:57,700
Actually, I am quite
stressed because of the work..

207
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,331
Just go, Kabir.

208
00:27:00,043 --> 00:27:01,539
Don't worry about me.

209
00:27:01,979 --> 00:27:03,984
I'll handle everything
here, alone.

210
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,789
And anyway,
what will you do here?

211
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,711
Just go.

212
00:27:09,882 --> 00:27:11,826
I wanted your support,
not your favor.

213
00:27:11,956 --> 00:27:13,784
Come on, Sanjana. You're making
a big deal out of this.

214
00:27:13,914 --> 00:27:15,004
I am not going anywhere.

215
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,835
And I won't go until
mom doesn't recover.

216
00:27:16,965 --> 00:27:18,456
But I will stay distracted..

217
00:27:18,861 --> 00:27:20,122
I can't help that.

218
00:27:20,947 --> 00:27:22,122
I know that.

219
00:27:23,111 --> 00:27:26,372
I am used to dealing
with my problems alone.

220
00:27:26,502 --> 00:27:28,076
To keep my emotions to myself.

221
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:30,201
For God's sake Sanjana,
all I said was..

222
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:31,414
Excuse me.

223
00:27:34,728 --> 00:27:35,876
The operation was successful.

224
00:27:36,006 --> 00:27:37,854
But you can't meet
your mom right now.

225
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,416
In the meantime,
you can complete

226
00:27:39,546 --> 00:27:41,031
some hospital formalities.

227
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:42,284
Please. Thank you.
- Okay.

228
00:27:42,414 --> 00:27:43,623
Thank you.

229
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,122
I'll take care of it.

230
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:53,141
It's all right. I'll do it.

231
00:27:53,712 --> 00:27:55,903
Sanjana,
I said I'll take care of it.

232
00:28:06,655 --> 00:28:07,711
Kabir!

233
00:28:09,578 --> 00:28:11,129
Namit sir? You?

234
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:13,289
It's..
I can't believe it.

235
00:28:13,581 --> 00:28:15,659
How are you?
- Good, sir. Good.

236
00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:17,992
But you tell me this.
You just disappeared for years.

237
00:28:18,122 --> 00:28:19,784
No contact or anything.
What are you doing here?

238
00:28:19,914 --> 00:28:21,516
I mean what are you doing here?
- Hey!

239
00:28:21,646 --> 00:28:22,506
Catch your breath first.

240
00:28:22,636 --> 00:28:25,914
Well.. After seeing you,
I feel perfectly all right.

241
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:28,951
You haven't changed at all.
Still the same.

242
00:28:29,081 --> 00:28:31,414
Looks and wits.

243
00:28:31,895 --> 00:28:34,919
What are you doing here
at this hour?

244
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:38,742
Well, sir, my mother-in-law's
admitted in this hospital.

245
00:28:38,872 --> 00:28:41,498
You don't worry,
she is in safe hands.

246
00:28:41,705 --> 00:28:43,289
This is a very good hospital.

247
00:28:43,623 --> 00:28:45,248
And then I am there.

248
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:47,909
Let me know if I can
be of some help. I'll do it.

249
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,029
Thank you so much, sir.
I know.

250
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:51,409
But first tell me
what are you doing here?

251
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,789
I am a psychologist
in this hospital.

252
00:28:54,217 --> 00:28:58,456
And I also run a Healing
Institute in Kottayam.

253
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,500
Healing Institute?
- Yeah!

254
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,944
These days I do everything.

255
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,800
Spiritual healing, etcetera.

256
00:29:04,405 --> 00:29:06,706
I have students, I also teach.

257
00:29:06,956 --> 00:29:09,076
Keep my card.
- Thank you, sir.

258
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,284
I.. I will call you, sir.

259
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:11,451
Sure?
- We'll definitely meet.

260
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:13,581
Yeah! Okay.
You take care.

261
00:29:14,915 --> 00:29:15,997
Okay?

262
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:19,080
It was nice seeing you, sir.
- Same here, Kabir.

263
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:43,909
Kabir. Kabir.

264
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,867
I saw her in the lift.
- Saw who?

265
00:30:45,997 --> 00:30:48,581
She's there.
- Who? Who's there?

266
00:31:07,983 --> 00:31:09,747
Can I say something?

267
00:31:11,581 --> 00:31:12,945
Will you believe me?

268
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:15,390
What is it?

269
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,956
She's here, Kabir.

270
00:31:19,782 --> 00:31:21,971
I can feel her.

271
00:31:22,984 --> 00:31:24,826
Feel who?

272
00:31:24,956 --> 00:31:26,706
Anjana.

273
00:31:28,247 --> 00:31:30,034
Sanjana, please.

274
00:31:30,164 --> 00:31:31,480
We're educated people.

275
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,669
Don't talk like
an illiterate woman.

276
00:31:35,283 --> 00:31:36,586
Kabir.

277
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,747
How long will it
take to fix this?

278
00:31:51,455 --> 00:31:52,872
Three to four days.

279
00:31:53,081 --> 00:31:54,289
Excuse me.

280
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:56,992
Oh! Maximum three to four days.

281
00:31:57,122 --> 00:31:58,539
Oh.. Okay.

282
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:01,119
Please get the work started.
- Okay.

283
00:32:07,504 --> 00:32:08,789
Leo!

284
00:32:10,288 --> 00:32:11,706
Leo!

285
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:24,081
Leo!

286
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:29,549
Where did he go?

287
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:44,248
Leo!

288
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:46,623
Leo!

289
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:52,938
Statue!

290
00:34:12,749 --> 00:34:13,830
Statue!

291
00:34:29,873 --> 00:34:31,384
I am sorry to say

292
00:34:31,514 --> 00:34:33,941
but your wife
has had a miscarriage.

293
00:35:00,456 --> 00:35:01,747
Kabir.

294
00:35:01,957 --> 00:35:05,302
I told you.. I had told you,
she's in this house.

295
00:35:05,432 --> 00:35:07,623
Kabir, she's trying to harm me.

296
00:35:08,414 --> 00:35:10,830
Kabir, please believe me.

297
00:35:11,106 --> 00:35:12,914
I saw her last night.

298
00:35:13,709 --> 00:35:14,726
Kabir.

299
00:35:15,412 --> 00:35:16,784
Last night,
in the courtyard downstairs..

300
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,408
We've had a miscarriage!

301
00:35:35,372 --> 00:35:37,914
We lost our child!

302
00:35:46,815 --> 00:35:48,817
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

303
00:35:53,127 --> 00:35:54,456
I wanted to.

304
00:35:55,539 --> 00:35:57,720
But I was scared.

305
00:35:58,372 --> 00:36:01,903
I didn't want to nurture
a deformed baby.

306
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:03,859
Like Anjana and Me.

307
00:36:03,989 --> 00:36:06,613
Whether deformed or abnormal

308
00:36:06,743 --> 00:36:08,164
but it would still have
been our baby.

309
00:36:08,294 --> 00:36:11,002
You hid such a
big truth from me. Why?

310
00:36:11,743 --> 00:36:13,994
You were drifting away from me.

311
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,460
After the child, you would've
drifted further away from me.

312
00:36:17,915 --> 00:36:21,967
Kabir, the truth is that
I can't stay away from you.

313
00:36:22,455 --> 00:36:24,451
I can't let anyone
come between us.

314
00:36:24,581 --> 00:36:26,969
Between us?
What madness is this?

315
00:36:28,205 --> 00:36:30,164
And children don't create rifts.

316
00:36:30,574 --> 00:36:32,747
They fill the void, Sanjana!

317
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,192
You could've done it too.

318
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:39,623
You've totally lost it, Sanjana.

319
00:36:39,813 --> 00:36:42,167
And it's all in your head,
not in this house.

320
00:36:42,297 --> 00:36:44,206
Because it's completely empty.

321
00:36:44,465 --> 00:36:47,069
It's filled with negative
thoughts, fear and illusions.

322
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:50,020
There's.. There's nothing here.
- Kabir.

323
00:36:50,624 --> 00:36:52,739
And look at the consequences.

324
00:36:54,477 --> 00:36:57,081
We lost our baby.
- Kabir.

325
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,571
Sanjana dear..

326
00:37:29,024 --> 00:37:31,043
My mother once said to me

327
00:37:32,873 --> 00:37:36,822
if you keep a knife
under your pillow

328
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:43,415
you won't see dream
about ghosts and evil spirits.

329
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:46,483
Will you try that?

330
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:49,551
Yes.

331
00:37:53,923 --> 00:37:54,955
Here.

332
00:38:46,689 --> 00:38:47,747
Kabir.

333
00:38:49,821 --> 00:38:51,880
Kabir, I..
- What?

334
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,008
You're bleeding.

335
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:57,742
Kabir, I..
- Who, Sanjana?

336
00:38:57,872 --> 00:39:00,162
There's no one here.
You've lost your mind.

337
00:39:00,292 --> 00:39:01,623
She..

338
00:39:04,317 --> 00:39:06,081
I am sorry.
- Yeah whatever.

339
00:39:06,658 --> 00:39:08,565
I am going crazy.

340
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:11,664
I am sorry.

341
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,563
I am sorry.

342
00:39:18,304 --> 00:39:20,570
I am going crazy.

343
00:39:22,507 --> 00:39:23,368
Okay.

344
00:39:23,498 --> 00:39:26,667
I am going crazy.
- I'm sorry. Okay?

345
00:39:27,309 --> 00:39:28,789
Kabir.

346
00:39:29,678 --> 00:39:32,888
Help me. Please help me.

347
00:39:33,807 --> 00:39:34,787
Kabir.

348
00:39:40,537 --> 00:39:43,844
So Sanjana, tell me something
about your childhood.

349
00:39:45,232 --> 00:39:46,789
What do I say?

350
00:39:48,195 --> 00:39:50,539
I have so many
childhood memories.

351
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,289
So many untold stories.

352
00:39:55,539 --> 00:39:58,373
Who were you closer
to in your childhood?

353
00:39:58,872 --> 00:40:01,581
Your mother or father?

354
00:40:02,414 --> 00:40:04,162
My sister, Anjana.

355
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,721
Anjana.
- What?

356
00:40:25,851 --> 00:40:28,076
We'll never separate.

357
00:40:28,206 --> 00:40:30,512
Promise?
- Promise!

358
00:41:01,078 --> 00:41:03,810
So why did you
two decide to separate?

359
00:41:05,587 --> 00:41:06,751
That..

360
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:15,498
Okay, okay, okay.

361
00:41:15,628 --> 00:41:16,872
Stop.

362
00:41:18,373 --> 00:41:19,682
Enough for today.

363
00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:24,853
We'll continue in
the next session. Okay?

364
00:41:26,231 --> 00:41:28,121
Now, relax.
- Okay.

365
00:41:30,248 --> 00:41:31,456
Kabir.

366
00:41:34,855 --> 00:41:36,940
It is a very delicate case.

367
00:41:38,387 --> 00:41:40,504
We need to handle
it sensitively.

368
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,194
She's been through a lot.

369
00:41:43,324 --> 00:41:45,118
Sister's death,
her miscarriage.

370
00:41:45,248 --> 00:41:46,783
Mother's accident.

371
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,110
For sometime

372
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:52,444
believe what she says.

373
00:41:52,574 --> 00:41:55,039
But, sir..
- Listen to me, Kabir.

374
00:41:56,538 --> 00:41:59,951
Just agree to what she says,
what she thinks.

375
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:02,434
Don't fight with her.
Even if you don't believe.

376
00:42:03,033 --> 00:42:03,896
Get it?

377
00:42:05,913 --> 00:42:06,956
Yes.

378
00:42:07,934 --> 00:42:09,015
Another thing.

379
00:42:09,523 --> 00:42:11,524
I think she needs a break.

380
00:42:12,315 --> 00:42:14,922
Take her out, in the open air.

381
00:42:15,344 --> 00:42:18,383
Let's see if staying away from
this house makes a difference.

382
00:42:22,872 --> 00:42:24,444
Where have you brought me?

383
00:42:24,574 --> 00:42:27,039
Ready?
- Ready.

384
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,143
Kabir, this..

385
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:58,144
This is a dream,
where there is you, me

386
00:42:59,495 --> 00:43:00,658
and no one else.

387
00:43:02,248 --> 00:43:04,630
This is your time.

388
00:43:05,235 --> 00:43:06,356
Not even mine.

389
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,138
I am really sorry, Sanjana.

390
00:43:10,526 --> 00:43:12,621
I didn't try to understand you

391
00:43:13,977 --> 00:43:15,675
and left you alone.

392
00:43:15,997 --> 00:43:19,502
Please. It was my fault too.

393
00:43:20,872 --> 00:43:22,597
I wanted to impart love

394
00:43:23,371 --> 00:43:25,079
instead I just became
a burden on you.

395
00:43:25,749 --> 00:43:27,883
I always thought about myself.

396
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:32,066
I should say sorry, Kabir.
- Enough.

397
00:43:32,832 --> 00:43:34,337
We're done apologizing.

398
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,770
Please forget everything.

399
00:43:38,121 --> 00:43:39,866
Kabir, what about mom?

400
00:43:39,996 --> 00:43:42,284
If there's an emergency,
the doctors will call us.

401
00:43:42,414 --> 00:43:43,872
I've taken care of it.

402
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,331
Trust me.

403
00:43:46,601 --> 00:43:48,567
And your trip to Mumbai?

404
00:43:50,223 --> 00:43:51,637
Changed your mind?

405
00:43:54,252 --> 00:43:57,081
Yes.
- "It says.."

406
00:43:58,039 --> 00:43:59,622
I changed my mind

407
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:05,742
about going back
and returning to you.

408
00:44:05,872 --> 00:44:14,254
"Let's spend those days again."

409
00:44:15,323 --> 00:44:20,865
"Brought me close to you,
made me restless."

410
00:44:20,995 --> 00:44:26,284
"Made me crave for you!"

411
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:30,789
"Made me crave for you!"

412
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,159
"Lost control.."

413
00:44:34,289 --> 00:44:36,784
"Lost control.."

414
00:44:36,914 --> 00:44:39,409
"Lost control.."

415
00:44:39,539 --> 00:44:41,728
"My heart's lost control."

416
00:44:41,858 --> 00:44:44,570
"Lost control.."

417
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,201
"Lost control.."

418
00:44:47,331 --> 00:44:49,826
"Lost control.."

419
00:44:49,956 --> 00:44:52,296
"My heart's lost control."

420
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:13,914
"Gives rise to desires
in the first rain."

421
00:45:14,357 --> 00:45:19,216
"Makes the heart beat faster."

422
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:24,456
"Restless by nature,
calls out to you."

423
00:45:24,787 --> 00:45:29,689
"Makes me cry when you're away."

424
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:32,518
"And no matter how I try"

425
00:45:32,648 --> 00:45:34,284
"it's impossible to pacify."

426
00:45:34,414 --> 00:45:39,659
"Brought me close to you,
made me restless."

427
00:45:39,789 --> 00:45:44,826
"Made me crave for you!"

428
00:45:44,956 --> 00:45:48,998
"Made me crave for you!"

429
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,409
"Lost control.."

430
00:45:52,539 --> 00:45:54,992
"Lost control.."

431
00:45:55,122 --> 00:45:57,659
"Lost control.."

432
00:45:57,789 --> 00:46:00,034
"My heart's lost control."

433
00:46:00,164 --> 00:46:02,867
"Lost control.."

434
00:46:02,997 --> 00:46:05,414
"Lost control.."

435
00:46:05,544 --> 00:46:08,038
"Lost control.."

436
00:46:08,168 --> 00:46:10,843
"My heart's lost control."

437
00:46:35,248 --> 00:46:40,081
"Let's wander
in those lanes again."

438
00:46:40,412 --> 00:46:45,243
"Where the breeze
of love always flew."

439
00:46:45,573 --> 00:46:50,665
"Why don't we meet
like strangers again?"

440
00:46:50,947 --> 00:46:55,801
"And introduce
each other once again."

441
00:46:56,039 --> 00:47:00,407
"And lose my heart again,
after meeting you."

442
00:47:00,537 --> 00:47:05,741
"Brought me close to you,
made me restless."

443
00:47:05,871 --> 00:47:10,951
"Made me crave for you!"

444
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:14,914
"Made me crave for you!"

445
00:47:15,665 --> 00:47:18,456
"Lost control.."

446
00:47:18,653 --> 00:47:21,118
"Lost control.."

447
00:47:21,248 --> 00:47:23,784
"Lost control.."

448
00:47:23,914 --> 00:47:26,119
"My heart's lost control."

449
00:47:26,249 --> 00:47:28,909
"Lost control.."

450
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:31,493
"Lost control.."

451
00:47:31,623 --> 00:47:34,118
"Lost control.."

452
00:47:34,248 --> 00:47:36,830
"My heart's lost control."

453
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,535
What happened?

454
00:49:04,665 --> 00:49:05,826
What happened?
- Kabir..

455
00:49:05,956 --> 00:49:07,742
That hand..
It was a hand..

456
00:49:07,872 --> 00:49:11,122
Kabir.. Kabir..
- There's nothing.

457
00:49:11,373 --> 00:49:13,455
It's nothing.

458
00:49:14,871 --> 00:49:16,214
'It didn't make a difference,
sir.'

459
00:49:16,344 --> 00:49:18,893
'She thinks Anjana's
following her everywhere.'

460
00:49:20,128 --> 00:49:24,872
Sir, it's said that,
if one of conjoined twins die

461
00:49:25,331 --> 00:49:27,700
the other doesn't live
for too long. I know..

462
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:30,155
I know this is all a..
- Hold on.

463
00:49:33,373 --> 00:49:35,286
You will have to understand

464
00:49:35,416 --> 00:49:38,576
that Anjana and Sanjana
were connected together

465
00:49:38,706 --> 00:49:40,576
even by soul,
not just physically.

466
00:49:40,706 --> 00:49:41,872
Don't you see?

467
00:49:42,581 --> 00:49:46,080
Maybe due to fear,
but they're still together.

468
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:47,898
They haven't separated.

469
00:49:48,217 --> 00:49:50,331
Sir, I agree you're right.

470
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:53,665
But Sanjana's problems started
after we came to Kerala.

471
00:49:55,665 --> 00:49:56,747
Do one thing.

472
00:49:57,456 --> 00:49:59,368
Consult the doctor and see

473
00:49:59,498 --> 00:50:03,614
if Sanjana's mother can be
shifted to a hospital in Mumbai.

474
00:50:05,415 --> 00:50:06,830
Yeah, I can do that.

475
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:11,404
Did you fix the roof?
- Yes.

476
00:50:11,534 --> 00:50:14,273
Have you done it properly?
- Yes, madam. I've done it.

477
00:50:16,843 --> 00:50:19,789
Mangla. Lock the doors.

478
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:22,122
Sorry, madam. I forgot.

479
00:50:22,588 --> 00:50:26,278
I'll lock the door.
How could I forget?

480
00:50:33,005 --> 00:50:34,659
Doc, I just want to know

481
00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:36,742
if we can shift her to Mumbai.

482
00:50:36,872 --> 00:50:38,326
It's important for me to go.

483
00:50:38,456 --> 00:50:39,956
And I'll get her treated.

484
00:50:40,191 --> 00:50:41,895
Mr. Kabir, forget treating
her at Mumbai

485
00:50:42,025 --> 00:50:43,766
she is not in a condition
to travel.

486
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:47,602
Sorry. I can't take that risk.
- I understand.

487
00:53:13,382 --> 00:53:15,534
When was the first time
you met Kabir?

488
00:54:34,162 --> 00:54:36,576
Sanjana, I'm going to
London for higher studies.

489
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:40,535
London? But why didn't
you tell me this earlier?

490
00:54:40,665 --> 00:54:42,951
And now suddenly..
- After my parent's divorce

491
00:54:43,081 --> 00:54:44,700
dad shifted to London.

492
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:47,784
He got me admission
in the Leigh University.

493
00:54:47,914 --> 00:54:50,304
So I have to go.
- But for how many days?

494
00:54:50,434 --> 00:54:52,243
Not days, but years.

495
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:54,045
Won't you come to the airport,
to see me off?

496
00:54:54,175 --> 00:54:56,201
Of course I will.
I will see you there.

497
00:54:56,331 --> 00:54:58,659
Okay, bye.
- Bye.

498
00:55:03,164 --> 00:55:06,665
Kabir's going to London,
for years.

499
00:55:07,136 --> 00:55:08,951
He's called me to the airport.

500
00:55:09,081 --> 00:55:10,159
I don't want to go anywhere.

501
00:55:10,289 --> 00:55:12,034
Anjana, let's go please.
- No.

502
00:55:12,164 --> 00:55:13,387
Anjana, please.
- No!

503
00:55:13,517 --> 00:55:15,118
'Anjana, let's go please.
- No.'

504
00:55:15,248 --> 00:55:19,039
After that it was difficult
for us to stay in touch.

505
00:55:19,959 --> 00:55:23,414
'I could neither write
a letter or an email.'

506
00:55:24,289 --> 00:55:25,373
'Nor call him.'

507
00:55:26,164 --> 00:55:27,284
Anjana!
Anjana, please give it to me.

508
00:55:27,414 --> 00:55:29,914
'Even mom didn't want us
to be together.'

509
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:33,456
'So she would hide
the letters he wrote to me.'

510
00:55:34,545 --> 00:55:35,789
'Maybe.'

511
00:55:38,288 --> 00:55:40,747
'Time went on.'

512
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:44,835
'Kabir had been away
for 10 years.'

513
00:55:48,915 --> 00:55:50,341
And one day.

514
00:55:55,111 --> 00:55:56,289
Hello.
- Hi.

515
00:55:57,588 --> 00:55:58,789
Kabir, is that you?

516
00:55:59,374 --> 00:56:00,539
Guess what?

517
00:56:01,542 --> 00:56:02,498
I am coming back.

518
00:56:03,974 --> 00:56:05,164
To you.

519
00:56:05,667 --> 00:56:08,039
You're coming back. When?

520
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:10,249
I can't believe this.

521
00:56:10,379 --> 00:56:12,289
I am coming back soon, Sanjana.

522
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,822
And this time you'll have to
come to the airport

523
00:56:13,952 --> 00:56:15,122
to receive me.

524
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,122
I don't know how,
but you will have to come. Okay?

525
00:56:18,538 --> 00:56:20,923
Yes, I will come.

526
00:56:21,053 --> 00:56:23,997
I definitely will.
No one can stop me this time.

527
00:56:24,541 --> 00:56:25,409
Good.

528
00:56:25,539 --> 00:56:27,819
Okay, I'll have to go now.
I'll.. I'll see you soon.

529
00:56:28,705 --> 00:56:29,997
Okay.
- Bye.

530
00:56:35,153 --> 00:56:36,914
Kabir is coming back.

531
00:56:37,465 --> 00:56:40,951
And he wants us to receive him.
Meet him.

532
00:56:41,081 --> 00:56:44,206
You can meet him, not me.

533
00:56:45,162 --> 00:56:47,122
Anjana, stop being so obstinate.

534
00:56:47,344 --> 00:56:48,873
We're no longer kids.

535
00:56:49,844 --> 00:56:51,665
I want to meet him, Anjana.

536
00:56:51,916 --> 00:56:54,206
He loves me
and I love him so much.

537
00:56:59,318 --> 00:57:01,706
This time I will meet him,
Anjana.

538
00:57:02,822 --> 00:57:05,467
Even if it means
separating from you.

539
00:57:06,499 --> 00:57:09,412
And that's when you decided
to separate from Anjana.

540
00:57:11,729 --> 00:57:13,665
'Yes, it was my decision.'

541
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:18,665
And I blame myself
for her death.

542
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:22,322
Yes, I killed her.

543
00:57:27,553 --> 00:57:28,453
If that's true

544
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:31,373
then you still have no reason
to feel so guilty.

545
00:57:32,874 --> 00:57:35,206
It's not wrong to
think about yourself.

546
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:40,280
Sometimes it's not a crime
to be selfish either.

547
00:57:42,092 --> 00:57:44,498
You're human being, not God.

548
00:57:46,456 --> 00:57:48,373
I was trying to be God.

549
00:57:49,061 --> 00:57:51,488
Made a decision about
someone else's life.

550
00:57:52,162 --> 00:57:54,956
She could've lived her life,
still be alive

551
00:57:55,457 --> 00:57:57,456
but I took away her life.

552
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:03,331
But she's back now.
She's following me.

553
00:58:03,623 --> 00:58:05,267
She wants to take me with her.

554
00:58:05,397 --> 00:58:07,414
Sanjana. Sanjana.

555
00:58:07,667 --> 00:58:10,039
Please try and understand.

556
00:58:10,789 --> 00:58:11,912
It's the after-effect
of her death

557
00:58:12,042 --> 00:58:14,419
which you're still
carrying along.

558
00:58:15,849 --> 00:58:16,997
Your fear

559
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:20,873
is nothing but the burden
on your heart.

560
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,081
The day you stop
blaming yourself

561
00:58:27,416 --> 00:58:29,706
you will stop seeing
Anjana as well.

562
01:02:23,529 --> 01:02:24,977
Kabir!

563
01:02:38,207 --> 01:02:39,389
Sanjana!

564
01:02:48,082 --> 01:02:49,164
Sanjana!

565
01:02:52,787 --> 01:02:53,997
Sanjana!

566
01:02:56,929 --> 01:02:58,122
Sanjana!

567
01:03:00,998 --> 01:03:01,956
Sanja..

568
01:03:09,361 --> 01:03:10,456
Sanjana!

569
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:13,872
Sanjana!

570
01:03:18,539 --> 01:03:19,623
Sanjana!

571
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:25,557
Sanjana!

572
01:03:26,167 --> 01:03:27,045
Sanjana!

573
01:03:27,372 --> 01:03:29,248
Sanjana!
Sanjana, wake up.

574
01:03:29,664 --> 01:03:30,665
Wake up.

575
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:32,753
Sanjana,
what are you doing here?

576
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:34,742
Kabir!
- W-Why are you here?

577
01:03:34,872 --> 01:03:36,747
I don't know, Kabir.

578
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:38,081
I don't know.

579
01:03:38,598 --> 01:03:41,872
I don't know.
Kabir, I am scared.

580
01:03:43,916 --> 01:03:45,784
Enough, Sanjana. Stop crying.
- Please help me.

581
01:03:45,914 --> 01:03:46,997
That's enough.

582
01:03:47,289 --> 01:03:48,489
Enough.

583
01:03:50,294 --> 01:03:52,315
Calm down. Calm down.

584
01:03:53,207 --> 01:03:54,773
Stop it.

585
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:18,677
Isn't one ghost enough
in this house?

586
01:07:18,807 --> 01:07:22,727
Oh mother-in-law! Does your
TV only air horror movies?

587
01:07:22,857 --> 01:07:24,617
I told you a thousand times
there's no such thing as ghost.

588
01:07:24,747 --> 01:07:25,561
But you..

589
01:07:25,884 --> 01:07:28,510
Madam said it for
the sake of her child.

590
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,818
The sister said for
the sake of her sister.

591
01:07:30,948 --> 01:07:32,551
So why won't you believe it?

592
01:07:32,731 --> 01:07:35,677
Mother-in-law,
everyone has a soul

593
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,257
in their body.

594
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:40,493
Once the body perishes
the soul won't come back.

595
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:43,677
Oh God! You confuse me

596
01:07:43,807 --> 01:07:45,931
if I'm inside
or outside the body?

597
01:07:46,138 --> 01:07:48,842
Oh God! Forget it. Go make some
breakfast and serve it to them.

598
01:07:48,972 --> 01:07:49,963
Go.

599
01:07:50,093 --> 01:07:52,431
Inside or outside the body?

600
01:08:37,491 --> 01:08:40,246
What are you looking at?
- You.

601
01:08:41,806 --> 01:08:45,264
Because I want to.
So I am looking at you.

602
01:08:46,525 --> 01:08:48,266
What else do you
feel like doing?

603
01:09:00,871 --> 01:09:02,598
I feel affectionate.

604
01:09:03,844 --> 01:09:06,135
There are so many things
in my heart.

605
01:09:08,188 --> 01:09:10,579
I want to say everything.

606
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:15,916
So then what's stopping you?

607
01:09:17,645 --> 01:09:19,931
Stay with me forever.

608
01:09:44,333 --> 01:09:45,969
Sanjana, I have to go.

609
01:09:48,577 --> 01:09:49,723
Go

610
01:09:50,717 --> 01:09:52,453
but come back soon.

611
01:09:53,559 --> 01:09:55,014
I promise.

612
01:13:10,215 --> 01:13:11,889
Mother-in-law! Mother-in-law!

613
01:13:12,168 --> 01:13:12,968
What is it?
- Mother-in-law!

614
01:13:13,098 --> 01:13:14,079
I saw Sanjana madam.

615
01:13:14,209 --> 01:13:16,335
She was lying on the floor
in the outhouse

616
01:13:16,465 --> 01:13:18,988
clutching on to her
sister's clothes and toys.

617
01:13:19,118 --> 01:13:20,399
And when I went closer

618
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:23,625
she stared back at me
as if she was possessed.

619
01:13:23,755 --> 01:13:25,120
Enough about ghosts and spirits.
Hold this.

620
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:27,181
Mother-in-law..

621
01:13:27,519 --> 01:13:29,884
Mother-in-law. Believe me,
I'm telling you the truth.

622
01:13:30,014 --> 01:13:31,473
Keep quiet, keep this plate.

623
01:13:31,603 --> 01:13:33,510
Take a look.
Please come take a look.

624
01:13:37,533 --> 01:13:40,640
Why did you drop
the plate on seeing her?

625
01:13:40,929 --> 01:13:42,723
What were you thinking?

626
01:13:42,853 --> 01:13:45,849
Sorry, madam, I..
- It's all right.

627
01:13:45,979 --> 01:13:47,499
It happens.

628
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:50,632
Next time, focus on your job

629
01:13:50,762 --> 01:13:52,556
and not the people
in this house.

630
01:13:53,426 --> 01:13:54,723
Okay.

631
01:13:56,758 --> 01:13:57,765
You..

632
01:14:29,523 --> 01:14:30,640
Sanjana.

633
01:14:42,616 --> 01:14:43,768
Sanjana.

634
01:14:52,586 --> 01:14:53,625
Sanjana.

635
01:16:15,928 --> 01:16:16,769
This..

636
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:31,080
No one can love you
as much as I do.

637
01:16:31,883 --> 01:16:34,059
And no matter how
many times I say this

638
01:16:34,412 --> 01:16:35,723
it's not enough.

639
01:16:36,573 --> 01:16:38,181
No matter how much
I express my love

640
01:16:38,915 --> 01:16:39,851
it's never enough.

641
01:16:39,981 --> 01:16:41,306
Sanjana.

642
01:16:43,734 --> 01:16:46,229
No one will come between us now.

643
01:16:46,893 --> 01:16:48,473
It's just you

644
01:16:48,784 --> 01:16:50,390
and me.

645
01:16:51,568 --> 01:16:53,056
What's the matter, Sanjana?

646
01:16:54,157 --> 01:16:55,831
Something's different about you.

647
01:16:57,448 --> 01:16:58,306
What?

648
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:01,139
Don't know.

649
01:17:03,165 --> 01:17:05,458
There's something different
but whatever it is

650
01:17:06,092 --> 01:17:08,130
I don't want to go
away from it.

651
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:25,264
"Embrace me in you."

652
01:17:26,063 --> 01:17:37,014
"Don't leave any
part of me in me."

653
01:17:37,388 --> 01:17:42,306
"You don't remember
who you are."

654
01:17:42,694 --> 01:17:47,931
"I don't remember who am I?"

655
01:17:48,354 --> 01:17:53,264
"Come embrace me."

656
01:17:53,767 --> 01:17:58,598
"And let me hide you
in my arms."

657
01:17:58,825 --> 01:18:03,972
"I'll trickle drop by drop."

658
01:18:04,439 --> 01:18:09,401
"And stay on your body."

659
01:18:09,767 --> 01:18:14,931
"I'll trickle drop by drop."

660
01:18:15,349 --> 01:18:20,327
"And stay in you."

661
01:18:43,206 --> 01:18:47,681
"Empty the river"

662
01:18:48,517 --> 01:18:53,556
"fill me with it."

663
01:18:54,145 --> 01:18:58,473
"Let me drink you up."

664
01:18:58,704 --> 01:19:04,539
"Quench my thirst."

665
01:19:04,848 --> 01:19:09,937
"Bring some clouds."

666
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:15,264
"And make them shower on me."

667
01:19:15,730 --> 01:19:26,300
"Let me drench you with drops."

668
01:19:26,558 --> 01:19:31,431
"You don't remember
who you are."

669
01:19:31,921 --> 01:19:36,931
"I don't remember who am I?"

670
01:19:37,446 --> 01:19:42,515
"Come embrace me."

671
01:19:42,798 --> 01:19:47,723
"And let me hide you
in my arms."

672
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:53,139
"I'll trickle drop by drop."

673
01:19:53,424 --> 01:19:58,801
"And stay on your body."

674
01:19:58,931 --> 01:20:04,056
"I'll trickle drop by drop."

675
01:20:04,483 --> 01:20:09,635
"And stay in you."

676
01:20:09,765 --> 01:20:15,210
"I'll trickle drop by drop."

677
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:20,593
"And stay on your body."

678
01:20:20,723 --> 01:20:26,106
"I'll trickle drop by drop."

679
01:20:26,236 --> 01:20:32,016
"And stay in you."

680
01:20:43,725 --> 01:20:45,348
I'll go see the doctor, okay?

681
01:20:45,779 --> 01:20:46,862
Okay.

682
01:21:12,099 --> 01:21:13,140
Mom.

683
01:21:34,308 --> 01:21:35,295
What happened?

684
01:21:35,425 --> 01:21:37,763
I don't know.
She was trying to say something.

685
01:21:38,202 --> 01:21:39,681
I don't know what happened.

686
01:21:43,196 --> 01:21:44,009
Yes, everything is fine.

687
01:21:44,139 --> 01:21:45,339
I mean, is there
anything to worry about?

688
01:21:45,469 --> 01:21:46,884
No, there's nothing
to worry about.

689
01:21:47,014 --> 01:21:48,104
Thank God we reached on time

690
01:21:48,234 --> 01:21:49,848
otherwise anything
could've happened.

691
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:54,765
So, how's Sanjana now?
- She's much better now, sir.

692
01:21:55,165 --> 01:21:56,556
What do you mean?
- I mean..

693
01:21:58,096 --> 01:21:59,348
The guilt about Anjana.

694
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:02,390
The nightmares, depression.

695
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,524
It's..

696
01:22:03,654 --> 01:22:04,931
It's all gone.

697
01:22:05,201 --> 01:22:06,431
Disappeared.

698
01:22:08,076 --> 01:22:09,765
And I just want
to thank you, sir.

699
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:13,084
You're the reason
I found my old Sanjana back.

700
01:22:13,624 --> 01:22:14,956
Thank you so much.

701
01:22:15,745 --> 01:22:16,807
Coffee.

702
01:22:18,487 --> 01:22:20,628
Hi, Sanjana.
- Hi.

703
01:22:24,853 --> 01:22:26,431
Sorry, excuse me.

704
01:22:28,173 --> 01:22:29,264
Yeah, Mohit. Tell me.

705
01:22:31,815 --> 01:22:33,390
Divya was talking about you.

706
01:22:34,281 --> 01:22:36,889
She said, 'We must invite
Kabir and Sanjana for lunch'.

707
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:39,056
Well, that's not
my bloody problem.

708
01:22:39,728 --> 01:22:41,801
I said, 'Good idea,
let's plan it out today'.

709
01:22:41,931 --> 01:22:43,343
Just send them
the logistical plan and..

710
01:22:43,473 --> 01:22:45,677
She was also planning
on watching a film.

711
01:22:45,807 --> 01:22:47,014
But..

712
01:22:48,564 --> 01:22:50,810
But, there must
be an alternative.

713
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:52,264
I am sure there's
something you can do.

714
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,348
Your husband is a busy man.

715
01:22:54,559 --> 01:22:55,859
Tell them, we are..

716
01:22:55,989 --> 01:22:58,227
You must feel lonely, right?

717
01:23:01,033 --> 01:23:02,681
Seriously, Mohit,
I can't handle it.

718
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:03,656
I know.

719
01:23:03,786 --> 01:23:06,801
I know your mother's ill,
but until I come back..

720
01:23:06,931 --> 01:23:08,837
Hello.
- You must handle it.

721
01:23:09,057 --> 01:23:11,640
You know this project
is very important for us.

722
01:23:11,889 --> 01:23:13,723
We cannot afford to
make any more mistakes.

723
01:23:13,931 --> 01:23:14,801
Sanjana.

724
01:23:14,931 --> 01:23:18,246
And the requirements from their
company, please update..

725
01:23:18,376 --> 01:23:19,848
Sanjana!

726
01:23:20,961 --> 01:23:22,056
I am sorry.

727
01:23:23,194 --> 01:23:26,021
I'll make the coffee.
- No. I'll make it.

728
01:23:26,151 --> 01:23:29,264
And, did the customs
release the shipment?

729
01:23:31,315 --> 01:23:33,801
Are you okay?
- Yes.

730
01:23:33,931 --> 01:23:35,807
I'm absolutely fine.

731
01:23:36,002 --> 01:23:38,473
After a decade,
I am finally happy.

732
01:23:38,889 --> 01:23:39,848
Thank you.

733
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:44,027
Sorry, sir, it was an important
call. Couldn't avoid it.

734
01:23:55,148 --> 01:23:56,578
Leo, shut up.

735
01:24:00,979 --> 01:24:02,500
Shut up!

736
01:24:06,118 --> 01:24:07,098
Shut up!

737
01:24:17,973 --> 01:24:19,557
I wonder what's wrong with Leo.

738
01:24:20,408 --> 01:24:21,931
He suddenly got violent.

739
01:24:22,127 --> 01:24:23,765
He barked at Sanjana.

740
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:27,593
I think he needs
counseling as well.

741
01:24:27,723 --> 01:24:29,536
Kabir, this is serious.

742
01:24:31,214 --> 01:24:34,557
Animals can see
what humans can't.

743
01:24:36,272 --> 01:24:39,066
It's called
Extra Sensory Perception.

744
01:24:42,139 --> 01:24:45,392
It's weird that he
got violent like this

745
01:24:46,747 --> 01:24:48,139
on seeing Sanjana.

746
01:24:50,766 --> 01:24:54,181
Maybe he sees
the change that you did.

747
01:24:58,588 --> 01:25:01,131
Something isn't right.

748
01:25:02,236 --> 01:25:03,295
Sir..

749
01:25:03,425 --> 01:25:07,098
Such drastic change in
such a short time is not normal.

750
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:10,181
Such people hide things.

751
01:25:11,416 --> 01:25:14,014
They have too many things
on their mind

752
01:25:14,432 --> 01:25:17,146
but they don't reveal it.

753
01:25:18,346 --> 01:25:21,306
They want people to
consider them normal.

754
01:25:21,618 --> 01:25:23,805
but, they are actually not.

755
01:25:24,804 --> 01:25:27,002
Sir..
Sir, I don't understand.

756
01:25:28,796 --> 01:25:29,931
Watch her.

757
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:32,300
Keep an eye on her.

758
01:25:33,437 --> 01:25:35,973
And keep this between us.

759
01:26:31,638 --> 01:26:32,931
Help.

760
01:26:33,623 --> 01:26:35,801
Help! Kabir!
- Sanjana.

761
01:26:35,931 --> 01:26:37,681
Kabir, help me!

762
01:26:38,243 --> 01:26:40,014
Help me.
- Leo!

763
01:26:40,542 --> 01:26:41,845
Leo, stop it.

764
01:26:42,141 --> 01:26:43,698
Leo. No, Leo.
- Help me, Kabir.

765
01:26:43,828 --> 01:26:45,640
No, Leo.

766
01:26:48,585 --> 01:26:50,618
Mother-in-law! Mother-in-law!

767
01:26:50,748 --> 01:26:51,569
Mother-in-law!

768
01:26:51,699 --> 01:26:55,042
Mother-in-law.. - Why are
you shivering in this weather?

769
01:26:55,172 --> 01:26:58,020
Are you sick?
- I won't work in this house.

770
01:26:58,150 --> 01:27:00,139
You won't work here? Why?

771
01:27:00,269 --> 01:27:02,912
Mother-in-law,
I am scared of Sanjana madam.

772
01:27:03,042 --> 01:27:05,253
Scared of Sanjana madam? Why?

773
01:27:05,383 --> 01:27:08,373
I was collecting my purse

774
01:27:08,503 --> 01:27:10,796
and that's when looked
out the window..

775
01:27:36,306 --> 01:27:37,598
Help!

776
01:27:37,886 --> 01:27:41,931
Help. Kabir, help me!

777
01:27:42,582 --> 01:27:43,807
Help!

778
01:27:45,759 --> 01:27:49,348
Kabir, help me! Help me!

779
01:27:50,731 --> 01:27:52,139
Help!

780
01:27:52,978 --> 01:27:55,718
Kabir, help me!

781
01:27:55,848 --> 01:27:56,931
Kabir!

782
01:27:57,631 --> 01:27:58,468
Leo!

783
01:27:58,598 --> 01:27:59,748
Kabir!
- Leo!

784
01:28:00,559 --> 01:28:02,187
Leo, stop it.

785
01:28:02,317 --> 01:28:04,780
Leo! Leo! No, Leo!

786
01:28:05,169 --> 01:28:06,785
Help me, Kabir!

787
01:28:29,582 --> 01:28:31,056
I don't know, sir.

788
01:28:32,349 --> 01:28:34,431
I don't understand.
I mean..

789
01:28:35,773 --> 01:28:37,848
There's always something
happening in this house.

790
01:28:39,392 --> 01:28:41,592
One thing's over
and another spring's up.

791
01:28:41,915 --> 01:28:43,357
I just don't know what to do.

792
01:28:45,044 --> 01:28:46,056
Sir..

793
01:28:48,928 --> 01:28:49,974
Yes, Mangla. Tell me.

794
01:28:52,469 --> 01:28:56,700
Sir, I don't know
if you'd believe me.

795
01:28:57,149 --> 01:28:59,522
But someone's cast
an evil eye on this house.

796
01:29:01,773 --> 01:29:02,629
With your permission

797
01:29:02,759 --> 01:29:04,420
I'll conduct veneration
in this house.

798
01:29:06,897 --> 01:29:08,701
And everything will
be fine after that.

799
01:29:11,856 --> 01:29:12,666
Okay.

800
01:31:44,741 --> 01:31:45,976
Sanjana.

801
01:32:07,512 --> 01:32:10,936
Just like there are
two kinds of human beings.

802
01:32:12,150 --> 01:32:15,205
Similarly,
there are two kinds of spirits.

803
01:32:15,876 --> 01:32:17,541
Good and bad.

804
01:32:18,826 --> 01:32:22,311
Bad spirits often
possess weak bodies.

805
01:32:22,752 --> 01:32:24,306
Trouble them.

806
01:32:24,609 --> 01:32:26,718
And later, kills them.

807
01:32:29,731 --> 01:32:33,529
The way your wife's getting weak

808
01:32:34,350 --> 01:32:36,311
she's getting seriously ill

809
01:32:38,248 --> 01:32:43,690
it proves that she's possessed
by her sister's spirit.

810
01:32:46,747 --> 01:32:50,175
But she won't
posses her for long.

811
01:32:52,703 --> 01:32:55,064
Soon, she will kill her.

812
01:32:57,773 --> 01:33:00,064
We have very little time.

813
01:33:10,816 --> 01:33:12,592
Hail the Bhoot Puran
(Book of evil)!

814
01:33:13,058 --> 01:33:14,686
Lord have mercy on us.

815
01:33:17,790 --> 01:33:21,534
This Bhoot Puran was
been written by ascetics

816
01:33:21,664 --> 01:33:23,773
thousands of years ago.

817
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:28,867
We can use the chants written
in them to control the spirit.

818
01:33:29,458 --> 01:33:32,113
Destroy all the
belongings of her sister.

819
01:33:32,243 --> 01:33:34,583
Cover every glass in this house.

820
01:33:34,752 --> 01:33:37,668
Mirrors, photographs,
everything.

821
01:33:37,890 --> 01:33:40,585
Because, as soon as
I start chanting

822
01:33:40,793 --> 01:33:42,816
the spirit will leave her body

823
01:33:43,086 --> 01:33:45,840
and try to hide in these things.

824
01:33:46,032 --> 01:33:48,001
And this shouldn't happen.

825
01:33:48,210 --> 01:33:51,418
I've covered all the
corners of this house

826
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:54,615
so that the spirit
doesn't leave.

827
01:33:55,459 --> 01:33:58,100
The spirit has to be
destroyed right here.

828
01:33:59,793 --> 01:34:04,629
Once I start chanting,
it will lie, try to distract us.

829
01:34:04,999 --> 01:34:07,168
She'll try to scare us.

830
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,910
But we'll have to be brave.

831
01:34:10,351 --> 01:34:12,189
Cover her face.

832
01:35:14,793 --> 01:35:15,835
Kabir!

833
01:35:16,152 --> 01:35:17,418
Kabir, help me!

834
01:35:17,837 --> 01:35:19,126
Kabir, help me!

835
01:35:20,543 --> 01:35:21,919
Kabir, they are hurting me!

836
01:35:22,386 --> 01:35:23,543
Kabir, help me!

837
01:35:24,502 --> 01:35:25,460
Kabir!

838
01:35:26,302 --> 01:35:27,543
Leave me.

839
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:29,341
Help me!

840
01:35:29,682 --> 01:35:30,882
Kabir, help me!

841
01:35:31,633 --> 01:35:33,298
Help me!

842
01:37:44,902 --> 01:37:47,412
No one can stop me!

843
01:37:47,542 --> 01:37:48,829
Let her go.

844
01:37:48,959 --> 01:37:51,106
You don't belong to this world.

845
01:37:51,236 --> 01:37:53,611
Go back to wherever
you came from.

846
01:37:53,741 --> 01:37:55,460
I didn't go there

847
01:37:55,590 --> 01:37:57,855
but I was sent there.

848
01:37:57,985 --> 01:37:59,534
She killed me.

849
01:37:59,664 --> 01:38:03,413
Now I will kill her.
I will kill her!

850
01:38:03,543 --> 01:38:04,830
Shut up!

851
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:08,952
Go away or else
I'll turn you to ashes.

852
01:38:09,082 --> 01:38:10,770
Go!

853
01:38:22,334 --> 01:38:24,043
Find the truth.

854
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:26,731
You'll get me out of her body

855
01:38:27,087 --> 01:38:28,716
but, how will you get me out
of this house?

856
01:38:29,083 --> 01:38:31,627
She killed me!
Killed me!

857
01:38:31,955 --> 01:38:34,455
She killed me. Took my life.

858
01:38:34,585 --> 01:38:38,293
Try to find the truth.
The truth.

859
01:38:57,202 --> 01:38:59,761
The spirit is out of her body

860
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,251
but, she's not in my control.

861
01:39:02,501 --> 01:39:04,851
She's still somewhere
in this house.

862
01:39:23,509 --> 01:39:25,043
You okay?

863
01:39:25,726 --> 01:39:27,502
My head's aching.

864
01:39:27,812 --> 01:39:31,293
The effect won't
wear off so soon.

865
01:39:34,645 --> 01:39:36,460
What happened with me, Kabir?

866
01:39:37,345 --> 01:39:38,786
What happened?

867
01:39:40,730 --> 01:39:42,985
Sanjana's returned
to me after a long time.

868
01:39:44,107 --> 01:39:46,066
Let me you in my arms first.

869
01:39:51,210 --> 01:39:53,811
Then I'll tell you
what Anjana did to us.

870
01:40:22,203 --> 01:40:24,835
'She killed me. Killed me.'

871
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:27,793
'She took my life.'

872
01:40:30,393 --> 01:40:33,335
Did Anjana's truth scare you
or Sanjana's lie?

873
01:40:33,751 --> 01:40:35,041
What do you mean?

874
01:40:35,818 --> 01:40:37,072
What's all this?

875
01:40:42,779 --> 01:40:45,027
All I got was lies, so I thought

876
01:40:45,157 --> 01:40:49,293
I must lie to know the truth.

877
01:40:50,043 --> 01:40:51,353
Stop talking in riddles.

878
01:40:52,032 --> 01:40:53,335
Be clear.

879
01:40:53,627 --> 01:40:56,164
Even I am trying
to solve the puzzle.

880
01:40:58,891 --> 01:41:01,183
Tell me what you did?
Who did you kill?

881
01:41:03,085 --> 01:41:05,963
What was the lie
you always told me?

882
01:41:07,768 --> 01:41:09,058
Tell me, Sanjana!

883
01:41:11,574 --> 01:41:13,372
I never lied to you.

884
01:41:15,297 --> 01:41:17,352
You didn't lie to me, but you
didn't tell me the truth either.

885
01:41:18,309 --> 01:41:20,201
Anjana's spirit is
still in this house.

886
01:41:20,636 --> 01:41:23,360
And she won't leave you alone
until you don't speak the truth.

887
01:41:26,672 --> 01:41:28,793
Sanjana,
I don't want to argue with you

888
01:41:29,006 --> 01:41:31,333
or raise my voice.

889
01:41:33,127 --> 01:41:37,543
It's even your responsibility
to keep this relation intact.

890
01:41:38,335 --> 01:41:39,829
Now the choice is over.

891
01:41:40,729 --> 01:41:43,588
The truth might not
keep us together

892
01:41:45,981 --> 01:41:47,882
but a lie will
definitely shatter it.

893
01:41:57,709 --> 01:41:59,314
Okay, Sanjana.

894
01:42:02,544 --> 01:42:05,471
Your silence has
conveyed your decision.

895
01:42:07,398 --> 01:42:13,255
But Sanjana, everyone
has to pay for their deeds.

896
01:42:15,465 --> 01:42:17,345
You'll have to pay for yours

897
01:42:19,873 --> 01:42:21,654
and I will repent
for loving you.

898
01:42:32,929 --> 01:42:34,064
Kabir, stop.

899
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:35,819
I will tell you the truth.

900
01:42:37,289 --> 01:42:38,358
Please don't leave me.

901
01:42:39,368 --> 01:42:40,985
I love you very much.

902
01:42:41,953 --> 01:42:43,185
Please don't go.

903
01:42:46,899 --> 01:42:49,123
I will tell you everything.
Please don't leave me.

904
01:42:50,534 --> 01:42:51,989
Please don't leave me.

905
01:42:52,421 --> 01:42:55,252
I will tell you everything.
Please.

906
01:43:00,438 --> 01:43:04,751
Kabir is coming back,
and he wants us to receive him.

907
01:43:05,197 --> 01:43:09,284
Meet him.
- You can go, not me.

908
01:43:13,213 --> 01:43:15,197
I will meet him
this time, Anjana.

909
01:43:16,472 --> 01:43:19,000
Even if I have
to separate from you.

910
01:43:21,474 --> 01:43:23,362
Kabir doesn't love you.

911
01:43:24,555 --> 01:43:26,683
He just wants to separate us.

912
01:43:26,813 --> 01:43:29,041
So he's pretending to love you.

913
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:32,280
Otherwise,
what else could be the reason

914
01:43:32,410 --> 01:43:34,384
that he loves you instead of me.

915
01:43:34,514 --> 01:43:37,401
What's wrong with you, Anjana?
Have you lost your mind?

916
01:43:37,919 --> 01:43:39,692
He only loves me.

917
01:43:39,822 --> 01:43:41,554
He thinks of you
as a good friend.

918
01:43:41,684 --> 01:43:43,806
You snatched Kabir from me.

919
01:43:43,936 --> 01:43:46,288
You came between us.

920
01:43:46,806 --> 01:43:48,818
Because I know he loves me!

921
01:43:48,948 --> 01:43:50,052
And I love him!

922
01:43:50,182 --> 01:43:51,284
That's not true.

923
01:43:51,414 --> 01:43:53,960
Kabir loves me, not you.

924
01:43:54,193 --> 01:43:58,502
No? Then I'll make sure,
he only loves me.

925
01:44:27,448 --> 01:44:28,859
Anjana!

926
01:44:29,718 --> 01:44:31,158
Anjana!

927
01:44:32,217 --> 01:44:33,359
Mom!

928
01:44:33,935 --> 01:44:35,482
Mom!

929
01:44:39,066 --> 01:44:40,345
Mom!

930
01:44:40,706 --> 01:44:41,942
Mom!

931
01:44:50,029 --> 01:44:51,567
'That day mom saved me'

932
01:44:51,953 --> 01:44:53,529
'because it was an accident.'

933
01:44:54,216 --> 01:44:56,228
I didn't want to kill her.

934
01:44:57,301 --> 01:44:59,192
I was only trying
to save my life.

935
01:45:00,477 --> 01:45:02,942
Sanjana, why didn't
you tell me this before?

936
01:45:04,483 --> 01:45:06,651
Because I didn't
want to lose you.

937
01:45:11,527 --> 01:45:13,175
I'm so sorry, Sanjana.

938
01:45:15,369 --> 01:45:18,229
I didn't know
that my love for one sister

939
01:45:18,359 --> 01:45:20,941
would be the cause
of death for the other sister.

940
01:45:27,035 --> 01:45:28,544
Remember this.

941
01:45:30,281 --> 01:45:32,697
Anjana loved you very much.

942
01:45:34,333 --> 01:45:36,484
And I love you.

943
01:45:38,494 --> 01:45:40,167
So sorry, Sanjana.

944
01:45:57,795 --> 01:46:00,106
This means Anjana's spirit
is here to take revenge

945
01:46:00,236 --> 01:46:02,942
and, she won't leave
without doing so.

946
01:46:04,767 --> 01:46:09,250
There's something Anjana's
spirit is tethered to.

947
01:46:11,388 --> 01:46:14,526
Before she attacks Sanjana again

948
01:46:15,811 --> 01:46:18,568
you'll have to find
that thing and burn it.

949
01:46:18,904 --> 01:46:19,984
What happened?

950
01:46:20,382 --> 01:46:22,401
Sanjana, he says
something in the house..

951
01:47:17,961 --> 01:47:18,852
Come.

952
01:49:31,850 --> 01:49:33,540
It's coming from here.

953
01:49:56,837 --> 01:49:58,234
Anjana!

954
01:50:15,691 --> 01:50:17,028
Mother-in-law..

955
01:50:20,171 --> 01:50:22,107
We'll have to burn
this body right now.

956
01:50:23,871 --> 01:50:25,450
Go get kerosene.

957
01:50:30,104 --> 01:50:31,521
Walk faster.

958
01:50:31,651 --> 01:50:33,109
Mother-in-law..

959
01:50:38,287 --> 01:50:39,994
Come on.

960
01:50:56,928 --> 01:50:58,193
Let's go.

961
01:51:35,234 --> 01:51:36,734
Mother-in-law.

962
01:51:37,563 --> 01:51:39,615
Jaya! Jaya!

963
01:51:59,239 --> 01:52:00,484
Mother-in-law!

964
01:52:03,736 --> 01:52:05,026
Mother-in-law!

965
01:53:29,627 --> 01:53:31,268
Mother-in-law! Mother-in-law!

966
01:53:31,398 --> 01:53:32,900
Mother-in-law!

967
01:53:40,354 --> 01:53:42,155
Why are they taking so long?

968
01:53:46,871 --> 01:53:48,451
I'll take a look.

969
01:53:56,696 --> 01:53:58,028
Thank God you're here, sir.

970
01:53:58,197 --> 01:53:59,317
We found Anjana's dead body.

971
01:53:59,447 --> 01:54:01,614
We just need kerosene..
- Here.

972
01:54:01,941 --> 01:54:02,775
You have the kerosene?

973
01:54:02,905 --> 01:54:06,322
I found this when I went
in the house. I.. - Okay.

974
01:54:20,004 --> 01:54:24,786
You should never
try to fool spirits.

975
01:54:29,893 --> 01:54:31,151
Kabir!

976
01:55:05,946 --> 01:55:07,072
Kabir!

977
01:55:39,885 --> 01:55:41,169
Kabir!

978
01:56:02,780 --> 01:56:04,630
Hide and seek?

979
01:56:56,870 --> 01:56:59,192
Sanjana! Burn her body.

980
01:56:59,322 --> 01:57:00,946
Go! Go!

981
01:57:32,942 --> 01:57:34,238
Kabir..

982
01:57:34,782 --> 01:57:36,155
Kabir!

983
01:57:37,946 --> 01:57:39,364
Kabir!

984
01:57:55,156 --> 01:57:56,026
Kabir!

985
01:57:56,156 --> 01:57:56,992
Kabir!

986
01:57:57,698 --> 01:57:58,863
Kabir!

987
01:58:00,237 --> 01:58:02,155
Kabir, are you okay?

988
01:58:04,465 --> 01:58:05,781
Kabir!

989
01:58:17,804 --> 01:58:19,892
What do I call you?

990
01:58:20,697 --> 01:58:23,313
Sanjana or Anjana?

991
01:59:22,032 --> 01:59:24,525
Kabir, what are you saying?

992
01:59:24,655 --> 01:59:26,673
What do I call you?

993
01:59:27,363 --> 01:59:30,727
That's Sanjana's body, isn't it?

994
01:59:31,405 --> 01:59:32,783
No, Kabir.

995
01:59:33,027 --> 01:59:34,176
I am Sanjana.

996
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:35,863
That's a lie!

997
01:59:36,308 --> 01:59:37,614
How many times
are you going to lie?

998
01:59:38,991 --> 01:59:41,946
Please, tell me the truth now.

999
01:59:42,249 --> 01:59:43,739
Tell me the truth.

1000
01:59:44,004 --> 01:59:46,077
Kabir..
- Tell me the truth.

1001
01:59:47,094 --> 01:59:49,030
Tell me the truth.

1002
01:59:54,096 --> 01:59:58,761
No? Then I'll make sure
that he only loves me.

1003
02:00:37,873 --> 02:00:42,033
Mom, please.
From now, I am Sanjana.

1004
02:00:42,581 --> 02:00:44,506
I could not help it, Kabir.

1005
02:00:45,005 --> 02:00:47,169
I loved you like crazy.

1006
02:00:47,890 --> 02:00:49,323
I wanted you.

1007
02:00:50,036 --> 02:00:51,484
I couldn't live without you.

1008
02:00:51,614 --> 02:00:53,083
You couldn't live without me..

1009
02:00:53,695 --> 02:00:56,276
but, you could kill your sister.
- No.

1010
02:00:57,931 --> 02:01:01,567
Our relationship, our marriage,
it was all a lie. - No.

1011
02:01:01,697 --> 02:01:03,645
All these years I was deceived

1012
02:01:03,775 --> 02:01:05,655
because, it was all a lie.
- No.

1013
02:01:05,785 --> 02:01:07,322
Your whole existence

1014
02:01:07,452 --> 02:01:10,415
is nothing but a lie.
- No, Kabir.

1015
02:01:11,582 --> 02:01:13,738
Don't say that.

1016
02:01:13,868 --> 02:01:16,359
What's the difference
between me and her?

1017
02:01:16,715 --> 02:01:18,205
We were both the same.

1018
02:01:18,511 --> 02:01:20,374
Then why didn't you love me?

1019
02:01:20,504 --> 02:01:23,210
Having the same face doesn't
make you the same person.

1020
02:01:24,675 --> 02:01:27,199
People are always different.

1021
02:01:28,057 --> 02:01:29,030
Kabir.

1022
02:01:29,794 --> 02:01:31,412
And like you said

1023
02:01:32,981 --> 02:01:35,351
no one can replace anyone.

1024
02:01:36,633 --> 02:01:38,815
Kabir. Kabir..

1025
02:01:39,922 --> 02:01:43,572
That moment, that day,
that year.

1026
02:01:44,230 --> 02:01:46,231
All the time that
we spent together.

1027
02:01:46,361 --> 02:01:48,137
Don't they have any importance?

1028
02:01:48,545 --> 02:01:50,667
Every time you said you love me.

1029
02:01:51,147 --> 02:01:53,572
Isn't that worth anything?

1030
02:01:53,812 --> 02:01:56,322
Say it, Kabir.
- No.

1031
02:01:58,505 --> 02:01:59,601
It's worth nothing.

1032
02:02:02,772 --> 02:02:04,921
Because I always loved Sanjana.

1033
02:02:05,702 --> 02:02:08,476
When I was close to you, I was
not with you. And you knew

1034
02:02:08,606 --> 02:02:10,170
that you had taken
Sanjana's place.

1035
02:02:10,300 --> 02:02:11,530
Not yours.

1036
02:02:12,593 --> 02:02:16,937
Fine, then give me my place.

1037
02:02:17,067 --> 02:02:19,929
Forget her and accept me.

1038
02:02:20,085 --> 02:02:21,364
This locket.

1039
02:02:21,601 --> 02:02:24,983
Adorn this locket on me,
like you did to Sanjana.

1040
02:02:25,113 --> 02:02:26,001
Do it.
- Anjana.

1041
02:02:26,131 --> 02:02:27,921
Do it, please.
- Anjana.

1042
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:31,888
There's place for only
one person in the heart.

1043
02:02:33,038 --> 02:02:34,764
And no one else can take it.

1044
02:02:35,755 --> 02:02:39,170
Nor the moments together or
the nuptial rounds.. - Please.

1045
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:41,050
Kabir.
- Nor did we breathe together.

1046
02:02:41,180 --> 02:02:43,097
So just let it go.

1047
02:02:43,596 --> 02:02:45,100
Because this..

1048
02:02:45,983 --> 02:02:46,800
Kabir.

1049
02:02:46,930 --> 02:02:47,793
...and me

1050
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,784
belong to someone else.

1051
02:02:50,914 --> 02:02:52,389
Kabir!

1052
02:02:58,372 --> 02:02:59,431
Kabir!

1053
02:02:59,561 --> 02:03:02,262
You can't leave.
You can't leave.

1054
02:03:02,508 --> 02:03:05,347
I won't let you go.
I won't let you go.

1055
02:03:05,638 --> 02:03:08,139
Say you love me.
Say you love me.

1056
02:03:08,583 --> 02:03:09,602
Say you love me!

1057
02:03:10,097 --> 02:03:11,675
Say you love me!

1058
02:03:11,903 --> 02:03:13,551
Say you love me, Kabir.

1059
02:03:13,681 --> 02:03:15,472
Say you love me!

1060
02:03:35,492 --> 02:03:37,681
It was always about Sanjana.

1061
02:03:39,015 --> 02:03:42,034
You never knew how much
I loved you.

1062
02:03:45,027 --> 02:03:46,878
If you can't be mine

1063
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:51,548
then no one else
can have you either.

1064
02:03:52,584 --> 02:03:54,168
You can't be anybody else's!

1065
02:05:00,220 --> 02:05:01,621
Kabir!

1066
02:05:03,355 --> 02:05:04,928
Sanjana!

1067
02:07:29,841 --> 02:07:31,301
"I conveyed my feelings"

1068
02:07:31,431 --> 02:07:34,329
"to you, through my eyes."

1069
02:07:34,459 --> 02:07:36,943
"You gestured your love"

1070
02:07:37,073 --> 02:07:38,876
"and I unhooked my tresses."

1071
02:07:39,006 --> 02:07:43,497
"Touch me,
slowly-slowly feel me."

1072
02:07:43,627 --> 02:07:45,455
"Don't tease me anymore"

1073
02:07:45,585 --> 02:07:47,671
"I could take it no more."

1074
02:07:47,801 --> 02:07:51,971
"I just want to,
feel your body."

1075
02:07:52,616 --> 02:07:54,161
"Touch my body."

1076
02:07:54,291 --> 02:07:56,639
"Don't be shy, my honey."

1077
02:07:57,109 --> 02:07:58,706
"Feel my body."

1078
02:07:58,836 --> 02:08:01,139
"I just want to,
feel your body."

1079
02:08:01,799 --> 02:08:03,307
"Touch my body."

1080
02:08:03,437 --> 02:08:05,681
"Don't be shy, my honey."

1081
02:08:06,309 --> 02:08:07,930
"Feel my body."

1082
02:08:10,976 --> 02:08:12,556
"Feel my body."

1083
02:08:17,814 --> 02:08:20,460
