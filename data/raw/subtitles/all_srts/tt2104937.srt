1
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:13,553
We're standing outside
the Pune Tennis stadium.

2
00:01:13,854 --> 00:01:17,585
Elderbaum All India Tennis
Final Match is going to be played.

3
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:20,683
In this final there is
one side Indian number one...

4
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:22,921
...and winner from 3
years Mr. Mahesh Singh.

5
00:01:23,196 --> 00:01:26,359
And on the other side is
up coming tennis star...

6
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:27,457
...Chirag Mehra.

7
00:01:56,596 --> 00:02:01,124
This noise, this crowd and
the moments before the game...

8
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:04,730
...is very
exciting for every player.

9
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:10,776
Today's match might
just be a game for viewers.

10
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:14,137
But I know...

11
00:02:15,315 --> 00:02:18,307
...today my
competition is with my own fate.

12
00:02:19,486 --> 00:02:24,423
I can not win till my aim
comes true related to this game...

13
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:30,154
...which I've started 16 years ago.

14
00:02:41,274 --> 00:02:43,708
Chirag! You didn't sleep yet.

15
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:53,485
Come on, come on.
- Good shot.

16
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,648
Chirag, you come and stand
here after school?

17
00:03:01,328 --> 00:03:02,886
You've a lot of
interest in this game.

18
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:03,857
Yes, sir.

19
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:05,724
Want to learn?
- Yes, sir.

20
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:07,198
Good. Get your racquet.

21
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:09,232
It's kid's nature...

22
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:15,268
...if you stop them from
something they'll insist to do that...

23
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:19,403
And maybe that was
happening with me too.

24
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,738
Chirag, very good.

25
00:03:22,182 --> 00:03:23,615
Back hand swing.

26
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:26,512
Very good.

27
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:30,281
After each day my
game was improving.

28
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:33,855
Everyone was happy, but my
destination was very far.

29
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:43,196
What's the big deal?

30
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:47,668
If I'll try 10-15 times then
I'll make 8-10 shots, correct.

31
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:49,501
Okay, come.

32
00:03:51,278 --> 00:03:53,303
What?
- Quiet. Stand straight.

33
00:03:55,882 --> 00:03:59,374
Chirag! You're being
serious, I was just joking.

34
00:03:59,886 --> 00:04:00,875
But I'm serious.

35
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:04,351
If you'll hit the ball
somewhere else then I'll be in trouble.

36
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:08,260
Do you understand?
- Shut up and don't move.

37
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:10,858
It's just a game for you
but it's a matter of my life.

38
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:12,121
Stand straight.

39
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:13,660
Okay. Aim at that can.

40
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:19,665
Good shot!

41
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:24,433
Mumbai's and Surat's consignment
of grapes...

42
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:26,274
...should be deliver by tonight.

43
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:28,540
Consignment will
be delivered on time,

44
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:29,478
Good.

45
00:04:29,883 --> 00:04:32,852
And I need report on my
table in just two hours.

46
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:35,320
I've already kept that.

47
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,479
Okay!

48
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:46,925
Vangi, I told you many times
to check every thing by your self.

49
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:49,158
I've checked by myself.

50
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:51,533
But in 2 box there is...
- What did you check?

51
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:52,936
See it's still raw?

52
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:54,640
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:08,745
Father.

54
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:11,748
Hey...

55
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:15,258
I hope you didn't get
hurt. Are you alright?

56
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:16,488
Get aside.

57
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:18,696
Let him breathe.
- Did you get hurt?

58
00:05:18,898 --> 00:05:21,833
Somebody fetch some water for
him, You guys get back to work.

59
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:24,263
Pratik, handle it.
- Okay.

60
00:05:24,504 --> 00:05:25,903
How did it happen?

61
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:29,175
He didn't sleep well nor
he take his meals on time...

62
00:05:29,242 --> 00:05:31,676
If he'll work in 2
shifts then it will happen.

63
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:33,736
It's not his age
to work for 2 shifts...

64
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:35,744
Then what else he'll do?

65
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:39,185
He's doing because he want
to get his daughter married.

66
00:05:39,452 --> 00:05:42,387
I just want to my
get daughter married...

67
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:44,550
...then I'll go back to my village.

68
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:46,489
Everything will be fine.

69
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:48,117
Take him to shelter.

70
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:49,786
Come, father.
- Take care.

71
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:54,197
Come on. Load this.

72
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:56,798
And keep these bad grapes aside.

73
00:05:57,604 --> 00:05:59,128
Pick up this.
- What is happening?

74
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,306
Who the hell is done this?

75
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:03,241
Who did it all?

76
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,540
Sir, that just...
- What just? Who did it?

77
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,338
I dropped them all.

78
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,677
You?

79
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:16,278
That's how you fulfil your
duty, So irresponsible.

80
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:18,317
You're are free now.

81
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:22,526
Now you'll load
these boxes in the truck.

82
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:25,192
And nobody will help him.

83
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:27,400
You all go.
- Sir, should I help him?

84
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,694
Shut up! Follow me.

85
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:31,234
Disgraceful! Sinful!

86
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:33,400
He thinks it's a joke.

87
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:36,268
Come on, let's get
back to the work.

88
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:38,276
Come on, start.

89
00:06:43,483 --> 00:06:44,780
Nice reprimand!

90
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,111
I'm tired.
- Really?

91
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:49,681
I'm helpless.

92
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:52,816
I don't have anyone except you...

93
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:55,757
...but I don't understand why
do you tolerate all these things.

94
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:57,763
Why don't you go
away from this Hitler?

95
00:06:57,931 --> 00:06:59,831
You know why I can't do it.

96
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:06,233
I'm going to Mumbai for some days.

97
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:09,541
Make sure that everything
should be perfect in my absence.

98
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:10,733
Yes.

99
00:07:11,144 --> 00:07:12,873
I don't need any trouble.

100
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:14,175
Yes.

101
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:15,443
Good.

102
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:23,281
Bye.

103

Come on. Do your work.

104
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:32,722
When will you clean this well?

105
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:34,824
We'll have to
drain the water first.

106
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:38,329
I've to stop the water
flow after that I'll clean it.

107
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:42,831

Why?
- Tomorrow is my daughter's wedding.

120
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:11,431
You didn't tell me.

121
00:08:12,138 --> 00:08:14,470
You need leave, So you can go.

00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:24,262
Mother, come to our vineyard once.

202
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,837

203
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:27,532
...even dad has
taken 4sqe land more.

205
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:31,467
Thanks for reminding me.

206
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:34,440

00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,341
The land is of 200 Acre.

208
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:39,609
I've thought to make an
elite township in your name.

209
00:15:39,885 --> 00:15:42,479
When you'll come to the office
tomorrow we'll decide its sale.

00:15:52,465 --> 00:15:53,864
Mother, that is for you.

213
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:59,901
Chirag, except you I don't
have interest in any thing.

214
00:16:05,544 --> 00:16:06,568
Excuse me.

215
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:08,575
Hello yes.

216
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:27,426
Chirag every children is playing.

217
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,192
What you're
thinking and sitting alone.

218
00:16:30,503 --> 00:16:32,596
Sister I'm thinking that...

219
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:36,106
...who is more important
among mother and father.

220
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:40,802
For a child both mother
and father is important.

221
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:44,147
Then why my mother and
father don't understand this.

222
00:16:47,753 --> 00:16:50,881
I know your mother and
father both love you a lot.

223
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:54,851
But I want to know that
with whom you want to leave?

224
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:56,717
With both.

225
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:01,195
Chirag, who is child
now and there should...

226
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:03,666
...not be any
disturbance in his education...

227
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:06,134
...so his mother
and father has the...

228
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:07,872
...responsibility of his education.

229
00:17:08,874 --> 00:17:11,308
During holiday of
boding school he'II...

230
00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:13,504
...be with his
father for one month...

231
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:15,303
And one month with her mother.

232
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:19,615
But I decided till the time mother
and father become one...

233
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,552
I'll continue this distribution.

234
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:44,171
Dad is really handsome. Right?

235
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:45,637
Sorry, did I scare you?

236
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:47,372
What are you doing?
- Sorry.

237
00:17:47,446 --> 00:17:49,676
When will you grow up, Chirag?
- Mom, I'm fine.

238
00:17:49,749 --> 00:17:51,740
This is fine. Everything
is proper. Chill.

239
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:59,215
Why did you stop it? Didn't
you like my childhood?

240
00:17:59,658 --> 00:18:01,319
Naughty! Stop it.

241
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,720
Oh... I got it.

242
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:05,158
Dad has ruined your mood.

243
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:08,091
Chirag.
- Okay. Chill.

244
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:12,304
But mom, night isn't so
boring at dad's vineyard.

245
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:13,595
Ah...

246
00:18:13,773 --> 00:18:15,764
What I mean is that so
many people are there...

247
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:17,367
And dad...

248
00:18:18,244 --> 00:18:19,677
Don't ask about him.

249
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:22,646
If you had been
there, it would've been fun.

250
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:27,418
You wouldn't miss me there.

251
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:31,222
I miss you. I don't know about dad.

252
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:33,852
Even if he misses,
he won't show it.

253
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:35,215
Let it be.

254
00:18:36,162 --> 00:18:38,187
I know him very well.

255
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:42,528
If you knew him well, you
would've been together.

256
00:18:44,437 --> 00:18:45,631
You know, mom...

257
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:50,197
...when I'm with you,
dad gets alone there.

258
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:53,168
And when I'm with dad...

259
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:56,845
...I feel the pain
of your Ioneliness.

260
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:00,280
I'm in no pain, Chirag.

261
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:03,344
Even of separation from dad?

262
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:06,252
No.

263
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:09,291
I'm only hurt...

264
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:11,389
...because of that man...

265
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:14,393
...my son was divided.

266
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:26,535
Chirag.

267
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:30,706
Chirag.

268
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:33,609
Oh God.

269
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:37,217
You're still sleeping.
Wake up. It's late.

270
00:19:38,257 --> 00:19:41,715
You're sleeping in the same clothes.
- Mom.

271
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:45,464
I came yesterday.

272
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:48,130
Let me sleep for more time. Please.

273
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,698
I told you there is work in office.

274
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:53,260
I'll come.

275
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:55,498
I've brought your favourite thing.

276
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:57,405
Cone and see when you get up.

277
00:20:01,914 --> 00:20:03,279
My favourite thing.

278
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:36,269
Wow mother, what a
machine I love it.

279
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:38,273
It's like flaying.

280
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:40,243
Thanks mother.

281
00:20:40,653 --> 00:20:42,917
I told you, you can
always count on me.

282
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:46,747
Mother, look whose phone is there?

283
00:20:46,825 --> 00:20:47,849
Yes.

284
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:52,421
Receive it.

285
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:56,626
Put on a speaker.

286
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:00,372
Hello.

287
00:21:00,472 --> 00:21:02,406
Why you look that much
time to pick up the phone.

288
00:21:02,474 --> 00:21:03,805
Is your mother there near you?

289
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,501
No she's in office.

290
00:21:08,581 --> 00:21:10,139
Why you phone me?

291
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:12,683
I'm not getting the
presentation of golden harvest.

292
00:21:13,385 --> 00:21:15,546
That is in my
folder on the desk stop.

293
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:18,120
But the file isn't opening.

294
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,417
What is the password.

295
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:21,789

296
00:21:24,229 --> 00:21:25,856
Ji Shalani or only Shalani?

297
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:27,789
Only Shalini.

298
00:21:28,734 --> 00:21:30,292
You dint get any other password?

299
00:21:30,636 --> 00:21:32,866
Why what is the problem in Shalani?

300
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:37,933

00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:39,201

My toys, clothes, books and

00:33:26,484 --> 00:33:29,749
But why you've my tennis trophies.

510
00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:32,782
Because your mom hates this game.

511
00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:34,749
But why dad?

512
00:33:35,894 --> 00:33:37,862
Because when you
were getting birth...

513
00:33:38,863 --> 00:33:40,626
I was playing a match,

514
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:43,800
Your mom felt that...

515
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:47,329
I don't care for
anyone except my career,

516
00:33:47,939 --> 00:33:49,770
So! Why don't you explain the mom,

517
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:52,541

518
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:56,572
But dad where will I
stay in my vaccations,

519
00:33:57,582 --> 00:33:59,914
One month with your mom...

520
00:34:00,685 --> 00:34:03,552
And one month with your dad.

521
00:34:04,422 --> 00:34:06,583
But I want to
stay with both of you.

522
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:23,096
Madam.

523

531
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:51,465
Dad is opening a
boutique in london.

532
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:54,603
And after a long
discussion he decided...

533
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:57,399
...that I'll keep
only Indian dresses.

534
00:34:57,675 --> 00:35:00,701
Because they've great
demand in western market.

535
00:35:01,312 --> 00:35:02,540
So...

536
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:05,249
And Chirag you'll help me out.

537
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:06,076

538
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:08,617
Come of show me the best stores.

539
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:10,511
Come on chirag.

540
00:35:10,655 --> 00:35:13,089
I've no idea
about all these things.

541
00:35:13,258 --> 00:35:14,850
Chirag come on you've to help her.

542
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:22,356
I'm in the mall, helping
to do shoping. I'm very well.

543
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:24,129
Yes this is nice.

544
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:25,702
Superb! Very good bye it.

545
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,599
Yes...

546
00:35:28,173 --> 00:35:29,299
Chirag see this.

547
00:35:29,374 --> 00:35:31,638
Both are nice bye it.
- Let's go from here.

548
00:35:31,843 --> 00:35:34,141
I don't understand what
you're exactly looking for?

549
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:36,179
If patern is nice then
thread work isn't nice.

550
00:35:36,347 --> 00:35:38,542
If thread work is nice
then fabric isn't nice.

551
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:41,775
If both are nice then there
is problem in colour combination.

552
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:43,677
I don't understand what to do?

553
00:35:43,855 --> 00:35:47,586
Creat something new your
own brand, make your own name.

554
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,484
You're right.

555
00:35:50,228 --> 00:35:52,287
I've not thought this.
- Then think now.

556
00:36:21,392 --> 00:36:22,450
Hello.

557
00:36:26,598 --> 00:36:27,622
Hi

558
00:36:28,299 --> 00:36:31,598
I was going for evening walk.

559
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,099
Walk in late night?

560
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:36,135
By doing jump I see.

561
00:36:37,342 --> 00:36:39,833
Actually I'm going to party.

562
00:36:40,478 --> 00:36:41,911
Wearing track suit and carrying...

563
00:36:42,146 --> 00:36:43,545
...a racket you're going to party.

564
00:36:44,449 --> 00:36:45,177
Wow.

565
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,146
Theme party, its a theme party.

566
00:36:48,486 --> 00:36:50,920
Someone is bringing bat and someone
is bringing hockey stick...

567
00:36:51,222 --> 00:36:54,316
And few people are
also bringing football.

568
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:57,155
So, I'm also coming with you,
Should I bring skiping roof?

569
00:36:57,228 --> 00:37:00,425
No girls aren't allow.

570
00:37:00,698 --> 00:37:02,632
Girls aren't allow in party.

571
00:37:03,468 --> 00:37:05,197
Its a gay party.

572
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,329
Aunty.
- Just listen.

573
00:37:07,405 --> 00:37:09,168
Listen...

574
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:12,233

575
00:37:13,177 --> 00:37:15,372
Actually! I was going for practise.

576

And you know
mother she hates tennis.

577
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,274
That is why I'm going like this.

578
00:37:20,351 --> 00:37:23,809
And If you'll tell the
mom then she'll be upset.

579
00:37:24,322 --> 00:37:25,346
That's why.

580
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:28,418
I won't tell her but
only on one condition.

581
00:37:29,193 --> 00:37:30,785
You've to take me out and show me...

582
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:32,625
...the night live and that is today.

583
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:34,288
Today?
- Yes.

584
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:36,257
Okay.

00:38:06,364 --> 00:38:12,428
I like you among
all these fairies.

590
00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:16,468
Come close to me.

591
00:38:16,608 --> 00:38:23,275
The heart goes astray.

592
00:38:23,448 --> 00:38:31,787
Your charm is enticing.
Come into my arms.

593
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:38,824

There is beauty
and the night is young.

597
00:39:06,124 --> 00:39:12,859
We are only aware of each other.

598
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:26,540
The sky is under my feet.
There is aroma all around.

599
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:33,380
When I saw you, my heart is lost.

600
00:39:33,451 --> 00:39:40,414
Your charm is enticing.
Come into my arms.

601
00:39:42,126 --> 00:39:49,089

612
00:40:38,449 --> 00:40:40,280

Hello. - You've so much

615
00:41:07,145 --> 00:41:09,841
But this time you cross the limit.

616
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:12,715

00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:20,923

Just a minute.

628
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:56,488
Hello. Hello...

635
00:42:17,882 --> 00:42:19,179
The boy is from London.

636
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,310
He has to go back tomorrow so
his family came here with proposal.

637
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,678
Okay.

638
00:42:25,389 --> 00:42:26,413
Congratulations.

639
00:42:26,657 --> 00:42:29,854
Sidhu. Such a quiet response!

640
00:42:30,294 --> 00:42:32,387
Why did you phone?

641
00:42:32,697 --> 00:42:34,631
Never mind. Just like that.

642
00:42:34,699 --> 00:42:38,191
Sidhu, you can't hide
your lie. Tell me.

643
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:45,798
Dharam, I wanted your
daughter and my son Chirag...

648
00:43:03,461 --> 00:43:07,397
My friend wanted this
but he never mentioned.

649
00:43:08,566 --> 00:43:10,500
Never mind.

650
00:43:21,812 --> 00:43:23,404
Friends hold it.

651
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,615
I said hold it.

652
00:43:30,721 --> 00:43:32,518
I said stop it!!

653
00:43:35,826 --> 00:43:37,726
No one is ready to listen.

654
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:40,661

655
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,933
Sir this party is canceled now.

656
00:43:48,406 --> 00:43:51,739
Have you drink more?
Are you concious?

657
00:43:53,611 --> 00:43:57,513
Yes I'm saying it after
thinking a lot...

658
00:43:58,582 --> 00:44:01,244

659
00:44:04,322 --> 00:44:07,587
How can you canceled? Have

Otherwise what you'll do?
You don't know who are we?

663
00:44:16,801 --> 00:44:18,769
Do you want to see what we can do?

664
00:44:18,836 --> 00:44:19,860
Hey...

665
00:44:21,339 --> 00:44:23,273
Don't think my father Ione.

666
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:25,536
Don't you listen

667
00:44:25,876 --> 00:44:27,741
Engagement is cancel means cancel.

668
00:44:27,912 --> 00:44:30,540
Manjit you don't know
what will be the result.

669
00:44:30,781 --> 00:44:35,741
Is there was any problem when
father fixed the engagement? - No.

670
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,748
Then what is the problem
when he's canceling it?

671
00:44:38,823 --> 00:44:39,847
What nonsense.

672
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:41,658
How can you do
this at the movement?

673
00:44:41,726 --> 00:44:43,523
Thanks God
because your time is good.

674
00:44:43,928 --> 00:44:46,158
Otherwise the way

You've not done nice.
We'll fix it.

677
00:44:50,935 --> 00:44:54,769
Hey... don't even dream
or you'll be in trouble.

678
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:58,240
Come son, they both
daughter and father are mad.

679
00:44:58,342 --> 00:45:00,207
We're safe from the mad family.

680
00:45:02,747 --> 00:45:05,682
Father, you don't worry.

681
00:45:06,584 --> 00:45:09,485
I know after thinking a
lot you've taken this decision.

682
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:11,782
What ever you'll say
that will only happen.

683
00:45:12,656 --> 00:45:13,680

00:45:28,406 --> 00:45:31,739
Chirag, look such a
nice photo of you and Kamiya.

690
00:45:32,143 --> 00:45:34,771
What Kamiya will
think after looking at this.

691
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:37,374
I don't look any problem in it.

692
00:45:37,548 --> 00:45:38,674

Not feeling well,

00:45:52,797 --> 00:45:54,492

00:46:31,302 --> 00:46:33,532
What you're doing?
Is daiting going on?

708
00:46:33,737 --> 00:46:35,728
Eat chicken.

709
00:46:35,806 --> 00:46:38,206

710
00:46:38,275 --> 00:46:38,866
Dad.

711
00:46:40,244 --> 00:46:41,541
Chirag has come.

712
00:46:41,745 --> 00:46:46,648
Wow... thank God.

713
00:46:46,851 --> 00:46:50,252

714
00:46:50,321 --> 00:46:53,222
Give me a hug.

00:46:53,357 --> 00:46:54,756
What a emotion movement sir.

716
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:00,126

717
00:47:00,431 --> 00:47:03,400

722
00:47:10,841 --> 00:47:12,638

00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:15,440
Vankey phone me but...
- Sir, we've talked too much...

724
00:47:15,513 --> 00:47:17,276

00:47:17,348 --> 00:47:19,213

726
00:47:19,283 --> 00:47:22,480

Manjit and now I'm well.

727
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,813
Manjit? Who Manjit?

728
00:47:25,422 --> 00:47:27,549

729
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:29,787
Manjit.

730
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:35,898
She has come. She's wonderful girl.

731
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,368
The time she come
every thing is changed.

732
00:47:39,436 --> 00:47:41,666
Manjit he's my son Chirag.

733
00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:42,763
Hi hello.

734
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,468
And he's his friend...
- Pratik. Sit and have food.

735
00:47:46,844 --> 00:47:48,641
You must be angry?

736
00:47:50,147 --> 00:47:51,842
Father, you're not eating.

737
00:47:52,283 --> 00:47:54,251
Enough daughter.
- Have some chicken.

738
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:57,287

- Take one more.

739
00:47:57,621 --> 00:48:02,354
Chirag eat food made by
Manjit. She cook very well.

740
00:48:02,526 --> 00:48:08,123
Not only in cooking my daughter
is also number one in studies.

741
00:48:08,399 --> 00:48:11,163
She's proud of Punjab.

742
00:48:13,404 --> 00:48:16,134
She's very nice and
tradition girl and even...

743
00:48:16,307 --> 00:48:18,332
...she respect the
traditional value.

744
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,806
How did you like food
made by daughter-in-law?

745
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:24,871
What happen?

746
00:48:26,483 --> 00:48:27,507
Daughter-in-law?

747
00:48:31,155 --> 00:48:33,555
Feeling very nice over here.

748
00:48:34,225 --> 00:48:37,160
Father. We've lands
in Punjab too but...

749
00:48:37,628 --> 00:48:40,119
...I never saw such
beautiful orchards.

750
00:48:40,898 --> 00:48:42,798
Then also why do you
always look so tense?

751
00:48:43,734 --> 00:48:46,601
No, daughter, I'm just upset...

752
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:48,233
Why?

753
00:48:50,207 --> 00:48:51,367
You know the reason.

754
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:55,874
Just win Chirag's heart anyhow.

755
00:48:59,283 --> 00:49:01,751
But uncle, what if
this doesn't happen?

756
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:05,750
Why not? There is
victory in your name.

757
00:49:06,123 --> 00:49:07,420
Manjit (winner of heart).

758
00:49:08,158 --> 00:49:09,182
It's true.

759
00:49:10,494 --> 00:49:13,793
Be quiet.
What's this trouble, Venky?

760
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:16,563
Her name is Manjit Aluwaliya.

761
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,598
What ever her name
is but what about him?

762
00:49:20,371 --> 00:49:23,534
Why you don't like it?
She's such a nice girl.

763
00:49:23,641 --> 00:49:27,577
Even aunty has called
a sweet girl from London.

764
00:49:27,811 --> 00:49:30,780
But Sir has already
recognise her has a daughter-in-law.

765
00:49:31,382 --> 00:49:33,680
So what can I do.
- Even you've to.

766
00:49:34,118 --> 00:49:35,142
Why?

767
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:36,643
Come?

768
00:49:37,521 --> 00:49:38,886
Listen it's like that.

769
00:49:45,129 --> 00:49:46,153
Okay.

770
00:49:46,363 --> 00:49:48,422
Sir, she has come.

771
00:50:13,223 --> 00:50:19,651
I am your Juliet, you're my Romeo.
We've love each other.

772
00:50:19,897 --> 00:50:26,302
I am your Juliet, you're my Romeo.
We've love each other.

773
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:33,503
O darling! Everyone knows this.

774
00:50:33,577 --> 00:50:39,777
I am neither your
Romeo nor are you my Juliet.

775
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:47,347
O darling! Everyone knows this.

776
00:51:04,308 --> 00:51:10,838
The family and priest is ready.

777
00:51:11,115 --> 00:51:17,111
Forget this. I won't marry you.

778
00:51:17,187 --> 00:51:23,717
Don't lie to me. You've
given your heart to me.

779
00:51:23,794 --> 00:51:31,428
You have loved me. Accept it.

780
00:51:31,502 --> 00:51:37,771
I am neither your
Romeo nor are you my Juliet.

781
00:51:37,841 --> 00:51:45,179
O darling! Everyone knows this.

782
00:51:58,896 --> 00:52:05,392
Destiny has brought
me between two valleyes.

783
00:52:05,569 --> 00:52:11,701
If you marry me, you'll
enjoy day and night.

784
00:52:11,775 --> 00:52:18,578
I break this ties.
I leave this town too.

785
00:52:18,649 --> 00:52:26,146
I beg you. Don't ruin my life.

786
00:52:26,223 --> 00:52:32,560
I am your Juliet, you're my Romeo.
We've love each other.

787
00:52:32,629 --> 00:52:39,694
O darling! Everyone knows this.

788
00:52:39,937 --> 00:52:46,206
O darling! Everyone knows this.

789
00:52:46,276 --> 00:52:57,346
O darling! Everyone knows this.

790
00:53:02,626 --> 00:53:03,718
Yes, come in.

791
00:53:04,561 --> 00:53:05,823
Oh...

792
00:53:09,867 --> 00:53:11,767
How do you feeling now?

793
00:53:14,905 --> 00:53:17,100
How am I feeling? Superb!

794
00:53:17,774 --> 00:53:20,800
I've flu, I've headache...

795
00:53:21,211 --> 00:53:23,805
I'm screwed up and you're
asking me how am I feeling.

796
00:53:24,181 --> 00:53:25,671
That's why I've brought this soup...

797
00:53:25,749 --> 00:53:27,376
...I don't want to drink your soup.

798
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:29,715
At least try it.

799
00:53:30,287 --> 00:53:32,755
My grandma said
that after drinking...

800
00:53:32,823 --> 00:53:35,257
...this soup your flu will be gone.

801
00:53:36,493 --> 00:53:39,121
Keep it over there, I'll drink it.
- No! No!

802
00:53:39,496 --> 00:53:41,521
You must have to drink it hot.

803
00:53:41,732 --> 00:53:44,826
I've made it for you,
Please drink it.

804
00:53:44,902 --> 00:53:46,665
You're back to me.

805
00:54:12,496 --> 00:54:14,088
Hello.
- Who is this.

806
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:17,230
Yes, I'm Manjit speaking.

807
00:54:17,434 --> 00:54:20,267
Who Manjit? Are you house maid?

808
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:23,496
I'm not a maid
I'm suppose to be Chirag's wife.

809
00:54:24,408 --> 00:54:27,343
Chirag's wife?
What are you talking about?

810
00:54:27,878 --> 00:54:29,607
Give phone to Chirag,
- He's in washroom.

811
00:54:29,813 --> 00:54:31,178
Tell me what do you want?

812
00:54:31,615 --> 00:54:32,673
What happen?

813
00:54:33,216 --> 00:54:36,208
Some Manjit is on the phone,
she's saying she's Chirag's wife.

814
00:54:36,286 --> 00:54:37,685
What?
- I've no idea.

815
00:54:38,422 --> 00:54:40,185
Hello, who is speaking.

816
00:54:40,457 --> 00:54:43,654
I think I'll have to give
you my complete introduction.

817
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:46,294
I'm Manjit Aluwaliya from bathinda.

818
00:54:46,496 --> 00:54:48,760
Daughter of Mr Dharampal Aluwaliya.

819
00:54:48,932 --> 00:54:51,492
Would be daughter-in-law
of Mr. Siddharth Mehra.

820
00:54:51,568 --> 00:54:53,229
Have you listen everything.

821
00:54:53,337 --> 00:54:55,464
Who you're talking to? Hello.

822
00:54:55,639 --> 00:54:59,268
So your dad called
you there for this reason.

823
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:03,305
You'll marry with
that illeterate girl.

824
00:55:03,714 --> 00:55:07,582
Chirag! If it will
happen then I'll kill myself.

825
00:55:07,684 --> 00:55:09,311
But there is nothing like that.

826
00:55:11,788 --> 00:55:12,812
What the...

827
00:55:41,151 --> 00:55:42,675
Mom. Dad.

828
00:55:45,722 --> 00:55:47,314
Why did you call me here?

829
00:55:48,358 --> 00:55:51,452
If you wanted to talk to me
then you could talk to me at home.

830
00:55:51,628 --> 00:55:55,587
No! Because I wanted to
talk both of you together.

831
00:55:57,801 --> 00:56:01,396
And it's not possible at your
banglow nor at your farm house.

832
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:07,335
You can keep any guest in
your house for the lifetime...

833
00:56:07,577 --> 00:56:08,874
I've no problem with that.

834
00:56:09,379 --> 00:56:11,643
But please don't
attach them with my life.

835
00:56:12,883 --> 00:56:15,351
I don't want to get married now.

836
00:56:16,153 --> 00:56:17,745
I've to make my career first...

837
00:56:19,089 --> 00:56:20,215
...as a tennis player.

838
00:56:23,593 --> 00:56:25,618
I know everything...

839
00:56:26,463 --> 00:56:28,328
You supposed to go for practise...

840
00:56:28,732 --> 00:56:32,099
You went to play the
match, You lied to me.

841
00:56:32,269 --> 00:56:34,294
I was helpless.

842
00:56:34,538 --> 00:56:36,403
I can understand
what problem has occured...

843
00:56:36,473 --> 00:56:37,804
...between you because of tennis

844
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:40,540
But I love this game.

845
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:42,673
I want to play tennis.

846
00:56:48,785 --> 00:56:50,844
Fine. On one condition.

847
00:56:54,124 --> 00:56:55,386
Say yes for Kamya.

848
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:57,626
What?!
- Not at all.

849
00:56:58,762 --> 00:57:00,457
He'll only marry with Manjit.

850
00:57:00,764 --> 00:57:02,789
My son will take this decision.

851
00:57:02,866 --> 00:57:04,663
Don't listen to her.
She'll ruin your life.

852
00:57:05,235 --> 00:57:07,362
Don't spoil your life like this.

853
00:57:07,671 --> 00:57:09,605
I didn't come
here to insult myself.

854
00:57:09,773 --> 00:57:11,434
And even I've not
come to see sunset.

855
00:57:11,508 --> 00:57:13,271
Will you both stop
and listen to me.

856
00:57:15,178 --> 00:57:17,806
To make both of you happy
I can't marry with both of them.

857
00:57:20,217 --> 00:57:22,515
I would've some
girl in my life whom...

858
00:57:22,786 --> 00:57:24,219
Whom I loved.

859
00:57:25,655 --> 00:57:27,088
Do you love someone?

860
00:57:27,557 --> 00:57:29,821
There is some girl in your life.

861
00:57:31,428 --> 00:57:32,486
Who is she?

862
00:57:33,463 --> 00:57:34,589
Who is she?

863
00:57:45,208 --> 00:57:46,300
That...

864
00:57:47,444 --> 00:57:48,468
She's that girl.

865
00:57:54,317 --> 00:57:55,614
I love this girl.

866
00:58:07,678 --> 00:58:09,475
You've created a nice blunder.

867
00:58:11,482 --> 00:58:15,816
Do you think your problem will
be solved if you shit in hotel?

868
00:58:18,255 --> 00:58:19,722
I don't know.

869
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:24,151
But at least we'll be rid
of Kamya and Manjit's matter.

870
00:58:25,162 --> 00:58:26,459
I can't handle this anymore.

871
00:58:28,465 --> 00:58:32,868
Chirag, suppose if for your
happiness your parents...

872
00:58:32,937 --> 00:58:36,429
...agree to let you
marry the girl you love...

873
00:58:36,974 --> 00:58:39,704
...what will you do?
Where will you find that girl?

874
00:58:39,977 --> 00:58:42,844
Forget address, you don't even
know the name of that girl.

875
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,380
First of all, it won't happen.

876
00:58:45,716 --> 00:58:48,116
Do you think they'll
agree for something?

877
00:58:54,258 --> 00:58:56,783
You can keep anyone as guest
in your house all your life...

878
00:58:57,161 --> 00:58:59,254
...but don't try to
link them to my life.

879
00:59:01,432 --> 00:59:05,300
There can be a girl
in my life whom I love.

880
00:59:13,744 --> 00:59:14,836
Good evening, madam.

881
00:59:16,313 --> 00:59:18,975
Take this. It has all the details.

882
00:59:19,483 --> 00:59:23,476
I think it's a game plan.
She has purposely wooed our sir.

883
00:59:24,154 --> 00:59:25,314
It's no match.

884
00:59:26,991 --> 00:59:29,016
Fine. You may go, Desai.
- Okay, madam.

885
00:59:40,437 --> 00:59:42,462
Yeah that's nice.

886
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:44,935
I think we'll go for take.
- Yeah.

887
00:59:45,075 --> 00:59:48,943
Anishka. Come a little upward.

888
00:59:51,415 --> 00:59:54,748
Anishka. A little up, you know.

889
00:59:57,354 --> 00:59:59,754
I mean... will you go little up.

890
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,418
What's sort of an attitude is this!

891
01:00:04,762 --> 01:00:05,729
I'll manage.

892
01:00:09,666 --> 01:00:11,327
Anishka! What are you doing?

893
01:00:11,468 --> 01:00:13,800
Director is shouting for long.
Don't you understand?

894
01:00:13,937 --> 01:00:15,871
Come up! I won't go more up.

895
01:00:15,939 --> 01:00:19,932
Then stay in rented
single room house for life.

896
01:00:20,711 --> 01:00:23,111
It's not a face cream ad.
It's a soap ad.

897
01:00:23,247 --> 01:00:24,441
Come up.
- Fine.

898
01:00:25,949 --> 01:00:29,407
You shud show off. That's better.

899
01:00:29,753 --> 01:00:31,243
Sir, okay now?

900
01:00:34,258 --> 01:00:35,384
You're looking good.

901
01:00:39,396 --> 01:00:40,420
See...

902
01:00:40,497 --> 01:00:41,691
What!

903
01:00:42,366 --> 01:00:44,732
Yeah, Anishka. That's nice.

904
01:00:45,035 --> 01:00:46,935
Roll camera.
- Rolling.

905
01:00:47,171 --> 01:00:48,035
Action!

906
01:00:51,775 --> 01:00:54,073
Cut. Cut. Cut it.

907
01:00:57,114 --> 01:00:59,810
Hello. Madam. What is this?

908
01:01:01,185 --> 01:01:03,085
Desai, just sort him out.
- Yes, madam.

909
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:05,980
What is this?
- She's our Shalini Ma'am.

910
01:01:06,056 --> 01:01:08,149
She wants to talk to her.
We'll reimburse you.

911
01:01:08,225 --> 01:01:09,715
It's an important
that's why she came here,

912
01:01:09,793 --> 01:01:11,385
What important?
Isn't our work important?

913
01:01:11,795 --> 01:01:12,887
So it's you.

914
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:14,820
Beauty with brains.

915
01:01:15,099 --> 01:01:16,396
Anishka Shrivastav.

916
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:20,232
What?

917
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:21,462
You're from Nainital.

918
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:25,267
Daughter of Head Constable
Ashwin Shrivastav.

919
01:01:25,976 --> 01:01:28,342
You left your college
and came to Mumbai.

920
01:01:29,046 --> 01:01:32,174
And since that day you're
working in small ad films.

921
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:33,874
Excuse me?

922
01:01:34,017 --> 01:01:35,712
Either it's modeling
or film industry...

923
01:01:35,986 --> 01:01:38,454
...here girl's careers
are very short.

924
01:01:39,256 --> 01:01:42,054
That's why they keep trying
to have relationship...

925
01:01:42,126 --> 01:01:43,491
...with a successful man...

926
01:01:43,961 --> 01:01:45,451
...that's why you've chosen Chirag.

927
01:01:46,296 --> 01:01:47,160
Chirag?

928
01:01:47,464 --> 01:01:50,331
Shalini Mehra's son Chirag Mehra.

929
01:01:51,135 --> 01:01:54,229
He's the only heir of
Multi Millionaire Empire.

930
01:01:55,272 --> 01:01:56,739
You already know that.

931
01:01:57,107 --> 01:01:58,699
What are you saying?

932
01:01:58,909 --> 01:02:00,308
Cut the crap, young lady.

933
01:02:00,944 --> 01:02:02,275
I'm giving you an advice...

934
01:02:02,846 --> 01:02:04,939
Stay away from my son's life.

935
01:02:05,716 --> 01:02:08,082
Or else you and your career...

936
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:11,151
I'll wipe it off like this.

937
01:02:11,788 --> 01:02:12,812
Okay?

938
01:02:16,793 --> 01:02:17,817
Who was she?

939
01:02:18,462 --> 01:02:22,159
Shalini Mehra!
- Who is Shalini Mehra?

940
01:02:22,699 --> 01:02:24,963
I don't know.
- And why was she scolding you?

941
01:02:25,068 --> 01:02:26,092
I don't know.

942
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:28,468
And who is this Chirag Mehra?
- How would I know that?

943
01:02:41,485 --> 01:02:44,079
Madam, we're out of gas.
- Get it filled.

944
01:02:44,354 --> 01:02:46,822
But money...
- Does money grow on tree?

945
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:52,018
My mood is ruined.

946
01:02:52,196 --> 01:02:54,790
I'll phone later. Yes, I'm home.

947
01:02:55,432 --> 01:02:57,263
Madam, some sir came to meet you.

948
01:02:57,401 --> 01:02:59,460
Sir? Who?

949
01:02:59,903 --> 01:03:01,928
I don't know. He said he
has important work with you.

950
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:03,365
Give me water.
- Okay.

951
01:03:04,975 --> 01:03:06,806
He didn't tell you his name.
- I forgot to ask.

952
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:09,274
But he's waiting
for you in the lobby.

953
01:03:16,353 --> 01:03:17,342
Excuse me.

954
01:03:19,223 --> 01:03:20,656
Yes.
- You're here to see me?

955
01:03:20,857 --> 01:03:21,448
Yes.

956
01:03:21,959 --> 01:03:23,654
Please. Sit.

957
01:03:26,997 --> 01:03:27,929
Tell me.

958
01:03:32,236 --> 01:03:34,136
I don't know how to start...

959
01:03:36,807 --> 01:03:41,676
...actually I learnt
about Chirag and you...

960
01:03:42,212 --> 01:03:45,113
...when decision of
his life was made.

961
01:03:45,716 --> 01:03:46,307
Hmm!

962
01:03:46,984 --> 01:03:47,780
Chirag?

963
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:49,808
Chirag is my son.

964
01:03:50,254 --> 01:03:52,188
Oh... okay. Okay.

965
01:03:52,456 --> 01:03:54,686
So what were you
saying about Chirag?

966
01:03:55,225 --> 01:03:58,683
I've fixed Chirag's marriage
with my friend's daughter.

967
01:03:59,296 --> 01:04:02,925
He won't go against my decision.

968
01:04:04,301 --> 01:04:07,896
So I came to request you...

969
01:04:08,138 --> 01:04:10,368
To get out of his life. Right?

970
01:04:12,109 --> 01:04:13,133
I won't...

971
01:04:14,044 --> 01:04:15,773
I won't get out of Chirag's life.

972
01:04:16,647 --> 01:04:18,638
You can do what you want!

973
01:04:36,967 --> 01:04:38,059
Chirag.

974
01:04:41,305 --> 01:04:43,705
Good Chirag! Very good.
- Thank you, sir.

975
01:04:46,109 --> 01:04:48,942
I'm playing but you're panting.

976
01:04:49,112 --> 01:04:51,672
Play... play more...

977
01:04:52,282 --> 01:04:54,079
Look at the result of your game!

978
01:04:56,086 --> 01:04:58,418
Aunt created a commotion
on Anishka's set.

979
01:04:59,289 --> 01:05:02,349
And media published
the news adding gossips.

980
01:05:02,926 --> 01:05:05,918
You're stuck! Mr. Chirag!

981
01:05:07,130 --> 01:05:08,757
Why are you smiling?

982
01:05:10,867 --> 01:05:11,663
Tara.

983
01:05:14,004 --> 01:05:16,404
No. I don't know
anything and you won't...

984
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,335
...phone me about this. Please.

985
01:05:19,743 --> 01:05:20,402
Great.

986
01:05:20,944 --> 01:05:25,074
You're on laptop and I'm
tired of answering the phone.

987
01:05:25,916 --> 01:05:27,781
It's becoming a big scandal.

988
01:05:28,085 --> 01:05:30,918
This Chirag and Shalini
Mehra... who are they?

989
01:05:32,122 --> 01:05:34,818
This is just the half story.
- Meaning?

990
01:05:35,125 --> 01:05:37,889
I mean his father reached home.
- What?

991
01:05:37,961 --> 01:05:40,020
Mother is threatening
and father is requesting...

992
01:05:40,097 --> 01:05:41,428
...to get out of his son's life.

993
01:05:41,798 --> 01:05:43,789
When I'm not in his
life, how can I get out?

994
01:05:44,368 --> 01:05:45,198
Point.

995
01:05:47,137 --> 01:05:48,263
Hello.
- Hello, Anishka.

996
01:05:48,905 --> 01:05:51,465
Chirag Mehra speaking.
I wanted to meet you.

997
01:05:51,808 --> 01:05:55,005
I see. So now you want to meet me.
- Yes, why?

998
01:05:55,245 --> 01:05:58,305
I've met your parents and I'm
not interesting in meeting you.

999
01:05:58,415 --> 01:06:01,248
But Anishka...
- Listen carefully, Chirag Mehra.

1000
01:06:01,718 --> 01:06:05,245
If you try to harass me,
I'll be severe on you.

1001
01:06:12,729 --> 01:06:14,060
What do we do now?

1002
01:06:14,865 --> 01:06:16,025
I don't understand.

1003
01:06:16,666 --> 01:06:19,328
We're homeless because
of Kamya and Manjit.

1004
01:06:20,270 --> 01:06:22,101
How can do you intend
to stay in this hotel?

1005
01:06:23,373 --> 01:06:24,397
I don't know.

1006
01:06:24,841 --> 01:06:25,865
Master...

1007
01:06:26,843 --> 01:06:28,140
What's the next move?

1008
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:31,704
It's the same.

1009
01:06:32,916 --> 01:06:34,247
I've to meet Anishka.

1010
01:06:36,686 --> 01:06:40,053
It's his phone.
- Wait. Listen. Relax.

1011
01:06:40,791 --> 01:06:42,315
Listen to me carefully.

1012
01:06:42,793 --> 01:06:46,092
Just meet him once. Talk to him.

1013
01:06:46,463 --> 01:06:49,330
You should know the real story.

1014
01:07:13,056 --> 01:07:14,182
Come on now...

1015
01:07:19,796 --> 01:07:21,627
Papa, my birthday cake.

1016
01:07:25,836 --> 01:07:26,962
Oh no...

1017
01:07:30,774 --> 01:07:31,297
Hi.

1018
01:07:40,083 --> 01:07:42,415
Whenever we meet something
goes wrong. Right?

1019
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:44,277
And you're the reason for it.

1020
01:07:44,855 --> 01:07:49,792
Can I know why you and
your parents after my life?

1021
01:07:50,894 --> 01:07:53,863
I'm sorry, Anishka.
It wasn't deliberate.

1022
01:07:55,999 --> 01:08:00,026
But now I feel everything
is happening is fine.

1023
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:01,794
Meaning?

1024
01:08:01,872 --> 01:08:02,896
I mean...

1025
01:08:04,774 --> 01:08:06,173
...I don't know how to say.

1026
01:08:08,445 --> 01:08:09,878
Okay, I'll say it straight.

1027
01:08:11,481 --> 01:08:14,814
What will you take to spend 15
- 20 days with me?

1028
01:08:17,821 --> 01:08:20,289
Anishka. What happened?
Will you tell me?

1029
01:08:28,732 --> 01:08:32,998
What does he think of himself?
He might be rich but...

1030
01:08:33,303 --> 01:08:34,429
Anishka. Listen.

1031
01:08:34,804 --> 01:08:37,500
What's the problem?
It's a matter of 15-20 days.

1032
01:08:38,308 --> 01:08:39,741
He's ready to pay you price.

1033
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:42,378
I think it's a very good deal.
You should make some money.

1034
01:08:53,924 --> 01:08:57,189
Page 3 for women.

1035
01:09:00,997 --> 01:09:03,227
Cut it. Fantastic. Very good.

1036
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:04,924
Next shot, Anishka.

1037
01:09:05,001 --> 01:09:05,865
Make up.

1038
01:09:07,871 --> 01:09:09,236
I don't need any white spots.

1039
01:09:10,974 --> 01:09:12,339
Sir. Sir.

1040
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:15,905
Sir has phoned to
pack up the shooting.

1041
01:09:17,914 --> 01:09:19,040
I'm ready for the shot.

1042
01:09:21,184 --> 01:09:23,015
Anishka, shooting is cancelled.

1043
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:26,878
Why is the shooting cancelled?
What's the problem?

1044
01:09:28,058 --> 01:09:29,685
Shalini Mehra.

1045
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,155
What does she has to do with my shoot?
- Anishka.

1046
01:09:32,862 --> 01:09:34,489
Shalini Mehra gives us business...

1047
01:09:34,731 --> 01:09:36,358
...of 200 Crore rupees every year.

1048
01:09:36,499 --> 01:09:40,060
We campaign for her 12 products.

1049
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:42,895
You got involved in a
controversy with her son.

1050
01:09:43,473 --> 01:09:46,738
Sir, media writes anything. They...

1051
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:51,440
Anishka. I'll have to replace
you from all my ad campaign.

1052
01:09:52,015 --> 01:09:53,277
You can not do that.

1053
01:09:53,516 --> 01:09:56,383
Your agency has a
legal contract with me.

1054
01:09:59,089 --> 01:10:02,889
Mr. Batra, you can't do this to me.
I'll drag your agency to court.

1055
01:10:02,993 --> 01:10:06,053
I won't spare you and
that Shalini Mehra.

1056
01:10:27,817 --> 01:10:28,943
Answer the phone.

1057
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:32,452
No use. Some shoot must
have been cancelled again...

1058
01:10:32,722 --> 01:10:35,486
...or some agency must've
phoned to cancel your agreement.

1059
01:10:42,465 --> 01:10:46,492
Anishka. All this is happening
because of that Chirag.

1060
01:10:47,904 --> 01:10:49,394
You've no choice.

1061
01:10:50,073 --> 01:10:53,270
So listen to me and
accept his offer.

1062
01:10:54,711 --> 01:10:56,975
Yes. He said he's very rich.

1063
01:10:57,247 --> 01:10:59,044
He's ready to pay any price.

1064
01:10:59,983 --> 01:11:01,245
So let's fleece him.

1065
01:11:02,419 --> 01:11:03,181
Ah...

1066
01:11:04,421 --> 01:11:05,445
What happened?

1067
01:11:06,122 --> 01:11:08,283
Nothing. I'm tense.

1068
01:11:08,725 --> 01:11:11,091
Don't be tense. I'm here
to handle everything.

1069
01:11:11,261 --> 01:11:12,125
Really?

1070
01:11:15,765 --> 01:11:16,789
She's here.

1071
01:11:19,235 --> 01:11:20,702
Hi. Nice to see you again.

1072
01:11:21,037 --> 01:11:23,665
Hi. I'm Avnit.
Her business manager.

1073
01:11:23,807 --> 01:11:25,434
Hi.
- So you can talk to me.

1074
01:11:25,742 --> 01:11:26,367
Okay.

1075
01:11:26,843 --> 01:11:27,707
Please.

1076
01:11:28,311 --> 01:11:30,404
So what's your proposal?

1077
01:11:31,014 --> 01:11:32,003
Actually...

1078
01:11:32,215 --> 01:11:36,481
Proposal is that for 2-3 weeks
she has to be with Chirag.

1079
01:11:36,853 --> 01:11:37,785
Meaning?

1080
01:11:38,088 --> 01:11:39,282
I'll tell you...

1081
01:11:39,856 --> 01:11:41,983
For a few days she
has to do a drama...

1082
01:11:42,192 --> 01:11:44,456
...to pretend that we're
lovers. That's all.

1083
01:11:44,794 --> 01:11:45,852
But why?

1084
01:11:46,396 --> 01:11:48,421
There are two problems.

1085
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,863
Okay. How many days for the days?

1086
01:11:54,204 --> 01:11:56,229
I think...

1087
01:11:56,372 --> 01:11:57,396
Be precise.

1088
01:11:58,408 --> 01:12:00,000
20 days. From tomorrow.

1089
01:12:00,877 --> 01:12:02,105
What will be your fees?

1090
01:12:05,315 --> 01:12:06,976
20 Lakh rupees.
- 20 Lakh...

1091
01:12:07,817 --> 01:12:08,943
...for 20 days.

1092
01:12:09,018 --> 01:12:10,042
Per day.

1093
01:12:12,689 --> 01:12:13,747
It's okay.

1094
01:12:14,424 --> 01:12:15,755
No problem.

1095
01:12:16,059 --> 01:12:17,788
I've to get used to it.

1096
01:12:19,829 --> 01:12:21,456
Anyways, I agree.

1097
01:12:32,942 --> 01:12:38,972
Often we get oblivious.

1098
01:12:39,115 --> 01:12:44,985
The heart shouldn't be lost.

1099
01:12:45,054 --> 01:12:51,050
Who knows when desires
will be kindled?

1100
01:12:51,261 --> 01:12:56,893
Who knows when
seasons will change?

1101
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:03,838
Hearts knows not
how love happens.

1102
01:13:04,174 --> 01:13:11,945
When eyes are locked...
dreams are woven.

1103
01:13:12,015 --> 01:13:20,684
When someone accompanies us,
he seems to be a dear one.

1104
01:13:21,291 --> 01:13:29,062
When eyes are locked...
dreams are woven.

1105
01:13:29,165 --> 01:13:37,766
When someone accompanies us,
he seems to be a dear one.

1106
01:13:43,346 --> 01:13:44,870
We've reached your house.

1107
01:13:45,181 --> 01:13:46,910
Thank you for the lift.
- You're welcome.

1108
01:13:47,917 --> 01:13:50,750
See you tomorrow.
- Okay. Anishka, I forgot...

1109
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:52,385
This is a gift for you.

1110
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:55,687
You got a gift for me.

1111
01:13:58,194 --> 01:13:59,058
Band aids.

1112
01:13:59,128 --> 01:14:00,789
You keep needing them.

1113
01:14:00,997 --> 01:14:03,465
It happens only
when you're with me.

1114
01:14:05,201 --> 01:14:06,168
But I'll keep it.

1115
01:14:07,370 --> 01:14:08,962
I didn't do anything.

1116
01:14:09,038 --> 01:14:11,063
I'm fine.

1117
01:14:12,408 --> 01:14:17,869
When we keep talking
of each other...

1118
01:14:18,681 --> 01:14:23,948
...the aura is filled with bliss.

1119
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:34,152
When you'll be in love,
you'll be restless.

1120
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:40,166
Who knows when desires
will be kindled?

1121
01:14:40,703 --> 01:14:46,107
Who knows when
seasons will change?

1122
01:14:46,276 --> 01:14:53,114
Hearts knows not
how love happens.

1123
01:14:53,683 --> 01:15:01,283
When eyes are locked...
dreams are woven.

1124
01:15:01,357 --> 01:15:09,662
When someone accompanies us,
he seems to be a dear one.

1125
01:15:18,408 --> 01:15:29,785
He'll come closer
one day, believe it.

1126
01:15:30,019 --> 01:15:36,049
The heart is crazy
and unrestrained.

1127
01:15:36,192 --> 01:15:40,128
Trust it.

1128
01:15:40,263 --> 01:15:45,997
Who knows when desires
will be kindled?

1129
01:15:46,402 --> 01:15:52,034
Who knows when
seasons will change?

1130
01:15:52,175 --> 01:15:58,978
Hearts knows not
how love happens.

1131
01:15:59,415 --> 01:16:07,151
When eyes are locked...
dreams are woven.

1132
01:16:07,223 --> 01:16:14,994
When someone accompanies us,
he seems to be a dear one.

1133
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:32,811
Are you fine, Anishka?

1134
01:16:35,952 --> 01:16:38,443
Be careful!
- I'm already careful!

1135
01:16:39,689 --> 01:16:41,054
Did I get astray?

1136
01:16:43,426 --> 01:16:44,723
I didn't know that...

1137
01:16:45,228 --> 01:16:49,187
...I'll enjoy this affair act.

1138
01:16:50,867 --> 01:16:55,236
I even forgot that there
is an end of this drama...

1139
01:16:55,471 --> 01:16:58,065
But there is a problem.
- What?

1140
01:16:58,741 --> 01:17:01,471
I practised with you.

1141
01:17:02,945 --> 01:17:05,175
Now where can I
find a boy like you?

1142
01:17:06,616 --> 01:17:07,913
Yeah...
- Anishka.

1143
01:17:08,985 --> 01:17:09,747
Mom.

1144
01:17:11,287 --> 01:17:13,312
The work for which
I was here is over.

1145
01:17:15,425 --> 01:17:17,290
Yes, mom. I'm all set to leave.

1146
01:17:20,897 --> 01:17:23,730
I'll call you when my return
ticket will be confirmed.

1147
01:17:26,235 --> 01:17:28,703
No, mom. I'm absolutely all right.

1148
01:17:30,706 --> 01:17:32,640
Just missing you. That's all.

1149
01:17:34,677 --> 01:17:37,407
I love you, mom. Okay. Bye.

1150
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:41,778
You've decided to go back.

1151
01:17:43,986 --> 01:17:46,181
And you didn't even tell me.

1152
01:17:49,058 --> 01:17:52,824
There is no more
reason to stay here.

1153
01:18:03,973 --> 01:18:05,065
What are you doing?

1154
01:18:06,142 --> 01:18:11,011
I've applied in Multi
National Company for a job.

1155
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:12,938
So I got my appointment letter.

1156
01:18:15,017 --> 01:18:16,678
Which address you've told them?

1157
01:18:21,057 --> 01:18:23,218
It was my mistake
that I thought that...

1158
01:18:23,292 --> 01:18:25,419
...this house will
be your new address.

1159
01:18:26,462 --> 01:18:28,157
I really don't want to...

1160
01:18:29,165 --> 01:18:30,996
But I'm staying for that friend...

1161
01:18:31,734 --> 01:18:33,702
Whose own son left the house.

1162
01:18:35,238 --> 01:18:37,468
I can't leave him alone like this...

1163
01:18:40,276 --> 01:18:42,267
And I won't left my dad alone...

1164
01:18:45,348 --> 01:18:46,440
And won't go anywhere.

1165
01:18:52,321 --> 01:18:54,755
Hey... let's celebrate.

1166
01:18:59,929 --> 01:19:00,953
Come on.

1167
01:19:01,097 --> 01:19:04,260
Oh... relax, Pratik. Take it easy.

1168
01:19:04,333 --> 01:19:07,325
No. Today is the celebration day...

1169
01:19:07,837 --> 01:19:10,431
Today we've booked
the entire hotel.

1170
01:19:10,706 --> 01:19:12,435
Our friend got freedom today,

1171
01:19:12,842 --> 01:19:15,834
Kamia and Manjeet's
chapter is closed.

1172
01:19:16,179 --> 01:19:19,876
Your all problems are
solved, Congratulations!

1173
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:24,877
Why you're sitting so quite?
Please smile.

1174
01:19:25,021 --> 01:19:26,045
Cheers.

1175
01:19:26,789 --> 01:19:29,087
Anishka, the credit goes to you.

1176
01:19:29,258 --> 01:19:31,192
You've done great acting
of being his girlfriend,

1177
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:32,124
Superb.

1178
01:19:32,195 --> 01:19:35,687
Once I felt she's
actually in love with him.

1179
01:19:35,831 --> 01:19:38,925
Nobody could think
she was only acting.

1180
01:19:39,135 --> 01:19:42,070
Everything looked so
real. Everyone got fooled.

1181
01:19:42,171 --> 01:19:45,163
You both looked so much in love.
What a performance!

1182
01:19:45,241 --> 01:19:48,870
That's a good performance.
You're great. Superb!

1183
01:19:55,785 --> 01:19:56,843
Excuse me.

1184
01:20:09,732 --> 01:20:11,131
Why did you come here?

1185
01:20:13,069 --> 01:20:14,263
Just like that.

1186
01:20:16,138 --> 01:20:18,368
Pratik is a crazy guy.
He says anything.

1187
01:20:19,709 --> 01:20:23,110
By the way, only I know the truth.

1188
01:20:26,115 --> 01:20:29,278
I know. You've tolerated me a lot.

1189
01:20:30,853 --> 01:20:34,016
I'm feeling addicted to you
after living so long with you.

1190
01:20:35,691 --> 01:20:37,249
I really enjoyed your company.

1191
01:20:39,262 --> 01:20:40,286
Anyways...

1192
01:20:40,429 --> 01:20:41,919
Can I call you sometime?

1193
01:20:42,932 --> 01:20:44,729
Will you come with me
for coffee or dinner?

1194
01:20:51,941 --> 01:20:54,739
Can't we extend this agreement?

1195
01:20:57,313 --> 01:20:59,008
Till the end of this life!

1196
01:21:29,078 --> 01:21:43,288
The one I found... the one
who dwells in my eyes...

1197
01:21:44,093 --> 01:21:51,397
The one I found... the one
who dwells in my eyes...

1198
01:21:51,467 --> 01:21:55,927
...she has come in my arms.

1199
01:21:56,005 --> 01:22:02,843
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.

1200
01:22:03,379 --> 01:22:09,909
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.

1201
01:22:40,916 --> 01:22:47,048
Maybe we had to meet.

1202
01:22:48,424 --> 01:22:55,921
We had to write this
exciting love saga.

1203
01:22:55,998 --> 01:23:01,300
Wait and watch what
will happen now...

1204
01:23:03,339 --> 01:23:10,142
When you're with me,
we can reach the sky.

1205
01:23:10,212 --> 01:23:14,649
Your words are magical.

1206
01:23:14,717 --> 01:23:21,088
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.

1207
01:23:22,057 --> 01:23:28,929
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.

1208
01:23:46,415 --> 01:23:51,978
Songs echo in the air.

1209
01:23:53,956 --> 01:24:01,328
The season is romantic
and the world seems new.

1210
01:24:01,397 --> 01:24:07,029
This is the effect of love.

1211
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:15,804
When heart is in love,
everything looks beautiful.

1212
01:24:15,878 --> 01:24:20,110
In moonlit night...

1213
01:24:20,182 --> 01:24:27,213
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.

1214
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:34,653
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.

1215
01:24:57,052 --> 01:24:58,178
What are you thinking?

1216
01:24:59,788 --> 01:25:05,727
First time my parent's
fight gave me something.

1217
01:25:06,195 --> 01:25:07,389
And that's you Anishka.

1218
01:25:09,999 --> 01:25:12,263
So that means I should
be thankful to them.

1219
01:25:12,434 --> 01:25:13,662
Yeah.

1220
01:25:15,304 --> 01:25:17,795
But it's my bad luck...

1221
01:25:19,775 --> 01:25:21,709
...I can't share my
happiness with them.

1222
01:25:22,177 --> 01:25:24,008
Next week I'm going to
play my final match...

1223
01:25:24,813 --> 01:25:26,440
I'm very close to my life goal.

1224
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:31,208
But this time my family won't
be with me to appreciate me.

1225
01:25:32,888 --> 01:25:34,185
Will you listen to me, Chirag?

1226
01:25:51,473 --> 01:25:53,407
Sidhu.
- Pal.

1227
01:25:53,876 --> 01:25:57,039
Ask him what he came to prove?

1228
01:25:57,446 --> 01:25:59,414
I didn't come to prove anything.

1229
01:26:00,449 --> 01:26:03,418
I just came to apologize
to uncle Dharam and Manjit.

1230
01:26:05,254 --> 01:26:08,189
You all are responsibility
for all this.

1231
01:26:12,361 --> 01:26:13,385
Anishka.

1232
01:26:20,669 --> 01:26:24,196
The girl I didn't even
know is everything for me.

1233
01:26:25,107 --> 01:26:28,270
I love Anishka.
I want to marry her.

1234
01:26:31,647 --> 01:26:33,877
But I won't do it
without your wish.

1235
01:26:36,752 --> 01:26:38,652
I don't want after marriage...

1236
01:26:38,721 --> 01:26:42,088
...we should have only
court's marriage certificate.

1237
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:51,058
I want blessings of
my dad and mom too.

1238
01:26:51,934 --> 01:26:53,868
I'm sure you won't refuse.

1239
01:26:56,905 --> 01:26:59,965
I want to share my
happiness with both of you.

1240
01:27:00,376 --> 01:27:01,968
With my mom and dad.

1241
01:27:03,946 --> 01:27:06,380
For me... for your son...

1242
01:27:07,016 --> 01:27:08,381
...will you make mom agree.

1243
01:27:09,218 --> 01:27:10,242
Please.

1244
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,621
Friend, where are you going?

1245
01:27:21,063 --> 01:27:25,432
In life your son has asked for
something for the first time.

1246
01:27:25,868 --> 01:27:27,301
Won't you listen to him?

1247
01:27:31,173 --> 01:27:33,801
You don't have to
go to any stranger.

1248
01:27:34,309 --> 01:27:35,901
She's your wife.

1249
01:27:36,211 --> 01:27:38,042
Please go, friend.

1250
01:27:38,781 --> 01:27:42,148
It's possible, this is the
way for estranged to unite.

1251
01:27:46,055 --> 01:27:48,990
Friend, don't worry about us.

1252
01:27:49,425 --> 01:27:55,022
We don't choose
destiny and matches.

1253
01:27:55,931 --> 01:27:58,866
It's made in heaven.

1254
01:28:00,302 --> 01:28:01,326
Correct, father.

1255
01:28:03,038 --> 01:28:06,030
Anyway, they look so nice.

1256
01:28:06,408 --> 01:28:08,273
Made for each other.

1257
01:28:08,944 --> 01:28:09,968
Come.

1258
01:28:10,713 --> 01:28:12,908
Come, son.

1259
01:28:14,283 --> 01:28:16,410
Don't look like this.
Won't you bless them?

1260
01:28:17,453 --> 01:28:18,477
Enough.

1261
01:28:19,755 --> 01:28:20,779
Come, son.

1262
01:28:26,028 --> 01:28:27,154
Thank you, Dharampal.

1263
01:28:36,371 --> 01:28:38,737
Come in.
- Madam, it's sir.

1264
01:28:39,808 --> 01:28:40,832
Who?

1265
01:28:41,009 --> 01:28:42,408
Your sir...

1266
01:28:48,450 --> 01:28:50,042
Make him sit. I'm coming.

1267
01:28:50,185 --> 01:28:51,209
Okay.

1268
01:29:15,911 --> 01:29:17,105
Please. Sit down.

1269
01:29:25,287 --> 01:29:29,485
Shalini. Didn't I
disturb you at this hour?

1270
01:29:32,227 --> 01:29:36,288
The reason for your arrival
can disturb, not you.

1271
01:29:39,134 --> 01:29:44,766
Shalini, we've passed our lives,
whether it was good or bad.

1272
01:29:45,808 --> 01:29:47,708
But now it's question of our son.

1273
01:29:49,344 --> 01:29:51,005
Chirag came to me...

1274
01:29:54,883 --> 01:29:55,941
...with Anishka.

1275
01:29:58,086 --> 01:30:02,022
He loves Anishka and wants
to spend his life with her.

1276
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:05,727
She's a nice girl.

1277
01:30:09,198 --> 01:30:10,324
I'm glad to hear that.

1278
01:30:11,033 --> 01:30:12,864
So go ahead.

1279
01:30:14,303 --> 01:30:15,895
You don't mind?

1280
01:30:19,374 --> 01:30:23,834
Sidharth, will you use
my son to win against me?

1281
01:30:26,181 --> 01:30:27,478
I never thought that.

1282
01:30:28,183 --> 01:30:29,207
What?

1283
01:30:30,252 --> 01:30:32,812
Are you the same who brought his...

1284
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:35,283
...friend's daughter seeing Kamya.

1285
01:30:35,924 --> 01:30:38,085
And when Chirag rejected her too...

1286
01:30:38,493 --> 01:30:40,927
...now you've accepted
that soap called...

1287
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:42,822
...model your
daughter- in- law.

1288
01:30:43,699 --> 01:30:44,757
Great.

1289
01:30:46,368 --> 01:30:50,304
Actually you're favoring my
son to make him go against me.

1290
01:30:50,472 --> 01:30:53,737
You're getting me wrong.

1291
01:30:53,909 --> 01:30:56,878
Absolutely not. I'm not wrong.

1292
01:30:57,012 --> 01:31:01,244
I know my son, his
nature better than you.

1293
01:31:02,050 --> 01:31:06,885
And that girl doesn't
deserve my son.

1294
01:31:07,022 --> 01:31:10,651
But Chirag...
- I've given my decision.

1295
01:31:11,693 --> 01:31:13,217
Would you please excuse me now.

1296
01:31:28,744 --> 01:31:29,768
Chirag.

1297
01:31:30,679 --> 01:31:32,203
I tried my best.

1298
01:31:32,781 --> 01:31:36,239
But your mother...
didn't agree for it.

1299
01:31:39,788 --> 01:31:43,383
Don't worry, son. I'm with you.

1300
01:31:50,299 --> 01:31:52,062
Chirag.

1301
01:32:03,211 --> 01:32:05,145
Chirag, everyone
is looking for you.

1302
01:32:05,213 --> 01:32:06,805
Why won't you answer my phone?

1303
01:32:07,182 --> 01:32:10,208
Chirag. Phone me urgent.
Call me back.

1304
01:32:10,419 --> 01:32:11,681
Chirag, where are you?

1305
01:32:11,753 --> 01:32:14,153
You won't answer any
phone or reply my message.

1306
01:32:14,256 --> 01:32:16,690
Everyone is worried. Where are you?

1307
01:32:16,959 --> 01:32:19,689
Please phone me.
I'm waiting for your call.

1308
01:32:28,971 --> 01:32:31,235
Sidharth, where is Chirag?

1309
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:33,373
He won't come for practice.

1310
01:32:33,742 --> 01:32:35,733
Only 2 days are
left for Final match.

1311
01:32:36,311 --> 01:32:38,108
All the formalities are left.

1312
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:40,908
Doesn't he want to play the match?

1313
01:32:43,418 --> 01:32:44,442
Do you hear me?

1314
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:46,151
I don't know anything.

1315
01:32:53,161 --> 01:32:54,992
What are you saying?

1316
01:32:55,230 --> 01:32:57,994
The truth. Chirag
isn't to be found.

1317
01:32:58,367 --> 01:33:00,995
He won't answer mine,
Anishka or uncle's phone.

1318
01:33:01,370 --> 01:33:03,736
He didn't go for
practice for a week.

1319
01:33:04,272 --> 01:33:07,207
Aunt, he did everything
to reach this Final.

1320
01:33:07,976 --> 01:33:10,103
And today when it's the time...

1321
01:33:10,379 --> 01:33:13,143
Aunt, please. Do something.

1322
01:33:27,963 --> 01:33:28,987
Chirag.

1323
01:33:34,936 --> 01:33:37,131
Yes. Why did you call me?

1324
01:33:39,808 --> 01:33:43,175
Chirag, you know everyone
is worried for you.

1325
01:33:44,312 --> 01:33:45,711
Why are you doing this?

1326
01:33:46,181 --> 01:33:47,205
I don't know.

1327
01:33:49,684 --> 01:33:52,847
You've the right to take
the decision of your life.

1328
01:33:54,723 --> 01:33:57,055
If your happiness
lies with Anishka...

1329
01:33:59,027 --> 01:34:00,085
...so be it.

1330
01:34:02,697 --> 01:34:04,096
I don't mind, Chirag.

1331
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,630
But how can you take the credit
by giving what's not yours?

1332
01:34:10,305 --> 01:34:11,203
Chirag.

1333
01:34:11,273 --> 01:34:14,140
Of course. I'm tired.

1334
01:34:14,976 --> 01:34:16,944
I'm tired of thinking
who is right or...

1335
01:34:17,012 --> 01:34:18,775
...who is wrong between my parents.

1336
01:34:19,948 --> 01:34:21,939
Who loves me more
and who loves me less.

1337
01:34:22,951 --> 01:34:23,975
Chirag.

1338
01:34:24,152 --> 01:34:26,120
What are you saying?

1339
01:34:26,388 --> 01:34:28,686
Yes, mom. This is the truth.

1340
01:34:29,458 --> 01:34:31,221
But you never realized it.

1341
01:34:32,194 --> 01:34:35,357
You're happy thinking you've
given everything to your son.

1342
01:34:35,831 --> 01:34:40,825
Dad was always worried that
your luxuries will ruin me.

1343
01:34:43,004 --> 01:34:46,371
I've lived two different
lives because of you.

1344
01:34:46,942 --> 01:34:49,433
But it's enough.
Let's end it.

1345
01:34:50,178 --> 01:34:51,270
I want nothing.

1346
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:54,114
Neither you nor dad nor tennis.

1347
01:34:56,017 --> 01:34:58,349
Just think that dad
lost in the arena...

1348
01:34:59,187 --> 01:35:01,917
...and your son lost before.

1349
01:35:26,214 --> 01:35:28,341
I won't tell you to sit, Shalini.

1350
01:35:29,151 --> 01:35:33,315
Because I'm sure that
our meeting won't be long.

1351
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:36,421
Don't waste time.

1352
01:35:37,192 --> 01:35:38,352
Sidharth, what's time...

1353
01:35:39,461 --> 01:35:41,929
...we've ruined our lives.

1354
01:35:43,798 --> 01:35:47,165
But today our son is on
the verge of destruction.

1355
01:35:47,335 --> 01:35:49,803
Our son... you're saying this.

1356
01:35:50,405 --> 01:35:53,772
You've fought a battle all
your life to make him yours.

1357
01:35:55,710 --> 01:36:00,704
What is lacking that only a
father can provide not a mother?

1358
01:36:02,450 --> 01:36:04,145
Talkin Cinema with Karan Adarsh.

1359
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:06,014
People of India and UK...

1360
01:36:35,317 --> 01:36:36,341
Chirag.

1361
01:36:37,152 --> 01:36:39,245
If you'll play and lose
so you'll be a winner,

1362
01:36:39,654 --> 01:36:41,053
But if you'll give up and lose...

1363
01:36:41,356 --> 01:36:43,017
Then you'll never
forgive your self.

1364
01:36:46,361 --> 01:36:48,955
Do you know Anishka?
Why did I play Tennis?

1365
01:36:50,065 --> 01:36:51,657
Because my dad give up.

1366
01:36:52,767 --> 01:36:54,132
And I've decided that...

1367
01:36:54,803 --> 01:36:56,828
I'll make him win from my victory.

1368
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:01,665
And I'll show my
victory trophy to my mom.

1369
01:37:05,914 --> 01:37:07,245
Now for who I'll play.

1370
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:14,246
Chirag! For those people with
whom you've no relationship.

1371
01:37:14,923 --> 01:37:17,153
But they still came
to watch your game...

1372
01:37:17,926 --> 01:37:20,793
They feel happy,
they applause for you...

1373
01:37:21,963 --> 01:37:24,056
In those viewers where
your parents aren't there...

1374
01:37:24,399 --> 01:37:26,094
But there are many
parents over there...

1375
01:37:26,167 --> 01:37:27,691
...who are watching you playing...

1376
01:37:27,836 --> 01:37:28,962
And told their kids...

1377
01:37:29,404 --> 01:37:32,066
That play like Chirag.

1378
01:37:37,145 --> 01:37:38,908
Good evening to you,
ladies and gentlemen.

1379
01:37:39,047 --> 01:37:40,742
Welcome to the Pune Tennis stadium.

1380
01:37:40,882 --> 01:37:44,318
You're about to witness
the final of the...

1381
01:37:44,786 --> 01:37:48,313
Yes, Vikram. Audience are
impatient for this match.

1382
01:37:48,423 --> 01:37:51,085
It's between defending
champion Mahesh...

1383
01:37:51,159 --> 01:37:53,286
...and upcoming star Chirag Mehra.

1384
01:37:53,395 --> 01:37:55,920
Vikram, this match has
been in controversy...

1385
01:37:55,997 --> 01:37:57,362
...because of Chirag Mehra.

1386
01:37:57,766 --> 01:38:01,361
Before the match there were
questions is he'll play or not.

1387
01:38:01,936 --> 01:38:03,927
Ladies and gentlemen
the wait is finally over...

1388
01:38:04,172 --> 01:38:06,697
and the players make their way
from the dressing room to the court.

1389
01:38:11,946 --> 01:38:14,676
And listen to the crowd as
they cheer for both the players.

1390
01:38:22,957 --> 01:38:25,892
We see the first sign of
competition as Mahesh Singh...

1391
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:28,019
...and Chirag Mehra give
each other a cold flare.

1392
01:38:30,165 --> 01:38:31,826
Players come on the
court for the toss.

1393
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:34,198
Just look at Mahesh not taking
the eyes of the opponent.

1394
01:38:34,402 --> 01:38:36,836
Telling Chirag Mehra the
challenger to the crown that...

1395
01:38:36,905 --> 01:38:39,169
...you've to bring out your
best game or you're done.

1396
01:38:41,843 --> 01:38:43,970
Chirag wins the toss
and choses to serve.

1397
01:38:44,245 --> 01:38:47,703
What should Chirag
do to win the match?

1398
01:38:47,949 --> 01:38:50,213
I think Chirag will have
to be more aggressive...

1399
01:38:50,285 --> 01:38:52,310
...take his chances
and hope for the best.

1400
01:38:52,387 --> 01:38:56,448
Most important, he should be
confident and mentally strong.

1401
01:38:57,125 --> 01:38:58,353
And Chirag ready to serve.

1402
01:39:05,867 --> 01:39:08,028
Mahesh smashes the ball
into Chirag's body...

1403
01:39:08,103 --> 01:39:10,162
...and Chirag is unable
to handle the ball.

1404
01:39:10,305 --> 01:39:15,242
First blood! Champion Mahesh
Singh gets love 15.Iove

1405
01:39:24,386 --> 01:39:25,717
What a good passing shot!

1406
01:39:25,854 --> 01:39:28,914
Mahesh looking come to the net.
And finish the point... Chirag...

1407
01:39:29,090 --> 01:39:30,853
The Chirag comes out with
answer with his own.

1408
01:39:30,925 --> 01:39:34,361
The first game goes
to Chirag Mehra.

1409
01:39:40,301 --> 01:39:42,963
Again Chirag changes
the direction of...

1410
01:39:43,037 --> 01:39:45,505
...the ball and Mahesh
can't return it.

1411
01:39:55,083 --> 01:39:58,109
Chirag Mehra is playing with
innovative and aggressiveness...

1412
01:39:58,186 --> 01:40:00,017
...and leading the first set by 52.

1413
01:40:00,088 --> 01:40:02,022
Chirag has started
strongly and he has...

1414
01:40:02,090 --> 01:40:03,887
...to maintain his momentum through.

1415
01:40:05,393 --> 01:40:07,953
A great passing shot by
Chirag of his back hand.

1416
01:40:08,129 --> 01:40:09,926
Chirag Mehra. 60. 15.

1417
01:40:09,998 --> 01:40:11,260
That's a commendable job.

1418
01:40:11,332 --> 01:40:13,766
And I think if he
continues in this spirit...

1419
01:40:13,835 --> 01:40:15,735
...there is nothing stopping
him from winning this match.

1420
01:40:15,804 --> 01:40:17,704
We got a nice set to watch...

1421
01:40:18,006 --> 01:40:21,134
Chirag had an answer
of every short...

1422
01:40:21,443 --> 01:40:24,708
And Chirag won the
first set of the match.

1423
01:40:48,069 --> 01:40:49,866
And here it begins the second set...

1424
01:40:50,004 --> 01:40:51,699
Mahesh Singh serves.

1425
01:40:58,813 --> 01:41:01,111
What a serve!

1426
01:41:03,251 --> 01:41:06,118
Mahesh Singh has started
the set aggressively.

1427
01:41:08,256 --> 01:41:09,848
Chirag. Focus.

1428
01:41:13,228 --> 01:41:16,163
Chirag has to do something
or else he'll lose this set.

1429
01:41:17,932 --> 01:41:20,127
He's not able to
concentrate the way he...

1430
01:41:20,201 --> 01:41:22,192
...was concentrating
in the first set.

1431
01:41:22,270 --> 01:41:25,103
Why we felt that something
is bothering Chirag...

1432
01:41:25,206 --> 01:41:26,696
It seems he's losing his focus.

1433
01:41:26,774 --> 01:41:29,208
I think he needs to get
his focus back again.

1434
01:41:29,277 --> 01:41:31,837
And he's already trailing 1-4
in the second set.

1435
01:41:48,429 --> 01:41:49,828
One more...

1436
01:41:50,965 --> 01:41:52,193
What are we seeing here?

1437
01:41:52,267 --> 01:41:53,928
I think this is
absolutely uncalled...

1438
01:41:54,002 --> 01:41:55,333
...for in the good game of tennis.

1439
01:41:55,403 --> 01:41:57,064
It reminds me of John McNore when...

1440
01:41:57,138 --> 01:41:58,765
...he used to argue with the umpire.

1441
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,735
It's not like him.

1442
01:42:00,842 --> 01:42:02,935
Chirag is very calm by nature.

1443
01:42:03,011 --> 01:42:05,138
It's not good to argue with umpire.

1444
01:42:05,313 --> 01:42:07,304
I think he should just
focus of his game...

1445
01:42:07,382 --> 01:42:09,976
...take control of himself
and just move on with it.

1446
01:42:11,853 --> 01:42:14,321
That's double fault. The
second set goes to Mahesh Singh.

1447
01:42:14,689 --> 01:42:16,850
And we're not level
with one set a piece.

1448
01:42:16,925 --> 01:42:20,224
If Chirag plays with the
form of his first set...

1449
01:42:20,295 --> 01:42:21,694
...things can turn.

1450
01:42:21,763 --> 01:42:24,288
Maybe the change of racket
will bring him some luck.

1451
01:42:31,172 --> 01:42:34,938
Chirag is lagging in
the third set as well.

1452
01:42:37,078 --> 01:42:38,875
Never double fault.

1453
01:42:38,947 --> 01:42:42,212
Chirag needs to improve on his serve
which has gone from bad to worse.

1454
01:42:44,152 --> 01:42:45,016
Chirag!

1455
01:42:56,230 --> 01:42:57,891
You can do it, son.

1456
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:16,343
Oh God! Chirag can't handle
Mahesh's forehand pace.

1457
01:43:16,751 --> 01:43:19,720
Third set is 4-2 to Mahesh Singh.

1458
01:43:27,061 --> 01:43:30,929
And Chirag is making
come back in the match.

1459
01:43:31,299 --> 01:43:35,167
Everybody is looking for a
fight and a competitive match.

1460
01:43:35,236 --> 01:43:36,260
Quiet please.

1461
01:43:43,211 --> 01:43:44,303
That was a bad ball.

1462
01:43:44,746 --> 01:43:48,113
I think Chirag was wrong footed
and he has twisted his ankle.

1463
01:43:48,249 --> 01:43:50,479
We hope that won't be very serious.

1464
01:43:50,718 --> 01:43:53,881
Physio is there at such an
interesting point in the game...

1465
01:43:54,022 --> 01:43:58,186
...you know I mean...
- The score is levelled at 6 all.

1466
01:43:58,393 --> 01:44:01,760
Injury is on the
deciding tie break.

1467
01:44:02,096 --> 01:44:04,428
Chirag is up. He'll
begin the tie break.

1468
01:44:04,799 --> 01:44:08,963
7 points will win. The tie
break will decide the match.

1469
01:44:09,103 --> 01:44:10,127
Quiet please.

1470
01:44:12,306 --> 01:44:14,399
1 to Mahesh Singh.

1471
01:44:19,681 --> 01:44:23,344
One more body shot. Mahesh
started aggressively in tie break.

1472
01:44:29,991 --> 01:44:34,052
Exciting match. Chirag is
making a comeback in this game.

1473
01:44:34,128 --> 01:44:37,359
That's another second hand by
Chirag. Match point to Chirag.

1474
01:44:37,432 --> 01:44:39,764
What an amazing turn
around to the game!

1475
01:44:39,834 --> 01:44:41,199
It's a nail biting finish.

1476
01:44:41,736 --> 01:44:43,465
Now we've reached to
that moment where...

1477
01:44:43,705 --> 01:44:45,002
...we'll get our next champion.

1478
01:44:47,008 --> 01:44:49,203
Ladies and gentlemen,
the match point.

1479
01:45:06,961 --> 01:45:08,724
I understand the
differences between...

1480
01:45:08,796 --> 01:45:10,161
...you and dad because of tennis.

1481
01:45:10,631 --> 01:45:12,326
But I love this game.

1482
01:45:13,067 --> 01:45:14,659
I want to play tennis.

1483
01:45:15,636 --> 01:45:17,433
I'll make them win with my win.

1484
01:45:18,372 --> 01:45:21,000
I'll show the trophy to mom.

1485
01:45:40,962 --> 01:45:44,762
We've a new champion
ladies and gentlemen.

1486
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:11,854
Our new all India tennis
champion. Chirag Mehra.

1487
01:46:34,916 --> 01:46:36,406
Well done, son.

1488
01:46:41,055 --> 01:46:42,147
Mom...

1489
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:43,414
I love you, son.

1490
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:47,984
Congratulations.

1491
01:46:54,468 --> 01:46:55,662
Anishka!

1492
01:47:00,074 --> 01:47:02,338
Congratulation!
Chirag won the match.

1493
01:47:02,977 --> 01:47:04,342
I've won both the games.

1494
01:47:20,928 --> 01:47:35,036
I have found the one
who dwells in my eyes.

1495
01:47:35,910 --> 01:47:43,248
I have found the one
who dwells in my eyes.

1496
01:47:43,317 --> 01:47:47,754
...she has come in my arms.

1497
01:47:47,822 --> 01:47:54,421
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.

1498
01:47:55,196 --> 01:48:02,329
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.

1499
01:48:40,241 --> 01:48:46,373
Maybe we had to meet.

1500
01:48:47,882 --> 01:48:55,220
We had to write this
exciting love saga.

1501
01:48:55,289 --> 01:49:00,852
Wait and watch what
will happen now...

1502
01:49:02,096 --> 01:49:09,400
When you're with me,
we can reach the sky.

1503
01:49:09,704 --> 01:49:13,970
Your words are magical.

1504
01:49:14,041 --> 01:49:20,469
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.

1505
01:49:21,349 --> 01:49:28,221
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.

1506
01:49:45,906 --> 01:49:51,435
Songs echo in the air.

1507
01:49:53,280 --> 01:50:00,743
The season is romantic
and the world seems new.

1508
01:50:00,888 --> 01:50:06,849
This is the effect of love.

1509
01:50:07,461 --> 01:50:15,129
When heart is in love,
everything looks beautiful.

1510
01:50:15,202 --> 01:50:19,400
In moonlit night...

1511
01:50:19,473 --> 01:50:26,402
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.

1512
01:50:26,981 --> 01:50:34,012
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.
