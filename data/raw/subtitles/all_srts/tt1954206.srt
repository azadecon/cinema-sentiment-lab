1
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:41,625
Mother.. I've heard that..

2
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:44,917
a beautiful world
exists beyond this village.

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,125
Big cities, grand markets and..

4
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:50,250
huge houses where
movies can be seen.

5
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:27,833
There's nothing of that sort.

6
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:28,875
Now get down.

7
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,417
Mother, you always break my dreams.

8
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,958
Dreams are meant to be broken.

9
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:36,042
Get down.
- No, I won't.

10
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:37,458
You won't?

11
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,958
What if I make you fall? Tell me.

12
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:41,792
You're my mother.
You'll make me fall?

13
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:44,708
If your mother makes you fall,
she will also help you to your feet.

14
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:48,125
If you fall in the city,
no one will help you to your feet.

15
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,000
Get down.. now!

16
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:51,333
No, I won't.

17
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,917
Get down.

18
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,375
Mother..

19
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,208
When He has blessed you with
one life, why think twice?

20
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:17,583
We barely get down to it...

21
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:19,375
and the bitch next
door is already on a roll!

22
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,792
Forget about her, darling.

23
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,250
Why don't you soothe
what's excited in here?

24
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,792
Get off!

25
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:34,958
Get off!

26
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,500
Now go to sleep. We
aren't doing it anymore.

27
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,167
Bloody idiots!

28
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:58,208
They can't do anything
without making a sound.

29
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:11,292
Marbles, cricket...
the choicest abuses...

30
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,458
He even made me wear boy's clothes.

31
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:15,250
If my father had his way...

32
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,500
he would even make me tease girls!

33
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,542
Didn't your mother ever stop him?

34
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:24,667
She gave birth to a girl instead of a
boy, so she remained a mute spectator.

35
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,792
Amma, tell me something...

36
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,167
I have what boys desire.

37
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,333
So, who is better?

38
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,250
Me or a boy?

39
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,500
Stop talking nonsense.
It's all rubbish!

40
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,750
Now don't be so coy. You're no less.

41
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:42,208
I can tell a lot of men have
been hard at work over here.

42
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:43,208
Stop it!

43
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:56,333
What?

44
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,500
Last night was fun.

45
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,250
Tonight could be even better.

46
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,792
My wife has a night-shift...

47
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,292
so tonight...

48
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,792
I merely touched you and it leaked...

49
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:20,833
your pen!

50
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,917
If I come over, what
will become of you?

51
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:24,083
You bitch!

52
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:25,625
My wife is right about you.

53
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,458
She is right about you too!

54
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:31,375
You like to go riding but you can
barely stay on for a few seconds.

55
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,375
You are mine...

56
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,167
so why hide from you...

57
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,417
You can take a peek.

58
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:03,833
When you will truly be mine,
then you can see the entire picture!

59
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,167
You can go in...

60
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,333
You can also go in...

61
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,125
You are out...

62
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,375
you can go back.

63
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,125
Okay, you can go in.

64
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:36,542
You are out.

65
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,250
- Sir... - You can't come in.

66
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,875
- The selection is done. - Sir,
sir... I want to be an actor, sir.

67
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,792
And I wanted to be a director.

68
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:49,875
Sir, I don't want to
dance like other girls.

69
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,458
I want to act, sir.

70
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:54,000
And I wanted to make offbeat films.

71
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:57,417
Sir, I'll do
anything to become an actor.

72
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,042
And to become a director
I could not do anything.

73
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:05,583
Would you like to see
what's not in these pictures?

74
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,083
Do you want to hear
the story of my film?

75
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:12,458
Sir, you aren't even listening to me.

76
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,667
Sir, step out of your film.

77
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:16,667
And you step out of your dreams.

78
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,292
There are 25 like
you waiting outside...

79
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,042
and tomorrow there will be 50 more.

80
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,125
You're good for nothing.

81
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:26,125
Neither do you have the seductive charm
of a lover nor the grace of a wife.

82
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,000
You are very dull.

83
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,583
I've been living on
sugar for two days...

84
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,167
so how can I look spicy?

85
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:36,542
Hold on...

86
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,667
take this and have something to eat.

87
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,250
And think about what you
want to do with your life.

88
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,625
Not everyone can become an actor.

89
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,792
Let's go somewhere else.

90
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,083
Why?

91
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,417
We can be by ourselves
at some late night show.

92
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,500
It will be fun.

93
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,292
I'll pay you.

94
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:18,750
How much?

95
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,042
20 rupees.

96
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,958
Only 20 rupees for me?

97
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,125
Take it.

98
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,083
Bloody pervert!

99
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:42,542
You're at the end of your life
and you want a fresh climax?

100
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,708
Neither do you have the seductive charm
of a lover nor the grace of a wife.

101
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,500
You are very dull.

102
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:17,000
Not everyone can become an actor.

103
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,125
There are 25 like
you waiting outside...

104
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:23,125
and tomorrow there will be 50 more.

105
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,917
Just a minute...

106
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:32,792
I'm not dull.

107
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,417
Who are you? What do you want?

108
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,500
Don't you remember?

109
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,958
You gave me some money
before rejecting me.

110
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,500
Here's your money.

111
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,292
I'm sure I have something for
which that guy forked out 20 rupees.

112
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,000
Sudhir, where is that girl?

113
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,000
How do I shoot the song sequence?

114
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,667
Where do I get a girl who
won't mind ripping her own skin?

115
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,708
Your whip scares the girls away...

116
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,667
You want me to do it?

117
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:01,208
Think you can bear the pain?

118
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,750
I bore it for so long, I'm
sure I can bear it ahead too.

119
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,375
Pan the camera.

120
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:48,125
Some say the glass is half full...

121
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,458
some say it's half empty.

122
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,042
And some are like Silk.

123
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,125
They say at least there is a drink.

124
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:56,083
Enjoy it.

125
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,625
It's stupidity.

126
00:12:58,042 --> 00:12:59,625
But often stupidity manages
to get things done that...

127
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,458
hard work and intelligence can't.

128
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,375
Sir...

129
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:22,500
Sir... sir...

130
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,417
You want to take the camera
through the girl? - Do you?

131
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,583
What sort of a shot is this?

132
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:28,542
You horny bastard, filthy mind...

133
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,417
- Sir... - Shut up!

134
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,583
You play the flute behind my
back and now you want to sing!

135
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:36,042
Give me that reel.

136
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,208
Please sit, sir...

137
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:39,917
I left the shot for one
day and see what happened.

138
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:41,042
Where is it? Stop it!

139
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:42,583
Sir, we'll cut it, please...

140
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:45,208
If you don't cut the reel,
I'll cut you somewhere...

141
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,750
and then you won't know
whether to wear trousers or skirts!

142
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,708
What's the occasion, Amma?
You're all dressed to kill.

143
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:12,792
Who is the poor guy?

144
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:15,542
Check out the newspaper,
your movie is out today.

145
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,042
Aren't we going for
‘first day, first show'?

146
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:18,583
Look...

147
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Amma...

148
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,042
wait here, I'll just get ready.

149
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,833
Everybody should know that...

150
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:30,333
every film has only one hero...

151
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,250
Director!

152
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,417
Every film one hero...

153
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,000
Who?

154
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,750
Director!

155
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,833
Everybody is staring at you.

156
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,167
Who is that?
- The director.

157
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,750
Oh...
- Come on!

158
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,750
Take off your sunglasses.

159
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,208
Where is our seat?

160
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:05,875
Amma, we'll watch my
first film from up close.

161
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,500
You mean it's the first row?

162
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:09,125
Here it is.

163
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,750
No, here.

164
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,250
- Wow, it's Selva
Ganesh's film. - Yes!

165
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,583
His films are entertaining.

166
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:23,583
Off with your sunglasses.

167
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:27,125
- Amma... - Yes?

168
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,000
Mark my words, now all
my problems will go away.

169
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,583
The dance director said
he liked my performance.

170
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,750
Really?

171
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,625
Another thing, Amma...

172
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:38,917
My life has moved from
‘pack up' to ‘action'.

173
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,417
Now I won't let it slip away.

174
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Hey! Shhh!

175
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,167
Stop talking.

176
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,375
What do you mean 'shhh'?

177
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,833
She is the heroine.

178
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:47,667
She is the heroine?

179
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,417
The heroine?

180
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,667
If she is the heroine,
can I get a refund?

181
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,167
Is this your song?

182
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,750
No.

183
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:09,917
This one?

184
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,375
Probably this is your song.

185
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:24,125
No...

186
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,333
Where is it?

187
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,208
Where is your song?

188
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:14,292
Miss Heroine...

189
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,417
heroine...

190
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:16,792
Can I at least have your autograph?

191
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,292
What has she done?

192
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,208
She's there in the whole film.

193
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:23,417
Reshma...

194
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,125
Madam... can I have your autograph?

195
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,500
People in Hollywood are
probably wondering..

196
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,583
..why I am wasting
my talent in India.

197
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:33,333
I wish you had left for Hollywood
before putting me into a loss.

198
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,875
I would have been better off.

199
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,750
Sir, you haven't
tasted real respect yet.

200
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,542
Nayla has written
such a fantastic review.

201
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,250
Look at the wonderful
things that have been printed.

202
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,583
Hey... You english show-off!

203
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:49,042
I would've been happy if at
least the tickets were sold.

204
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:50,458
Sir, you wait and watch...

205
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:52,375
because of this film, you
will have a trophy in your hand.

206
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,167
And a begging bowl in the other.

207
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:58,208
Nowhere in the film did
the 'hero reason' come alive.

208
00:17:58,542 --> 00:17:59,667
Not 'hero reason'.

209
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:00,875
It's heroism.

210
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,500
If you know it, why
didn't you portray it?

211
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,083
Sir, the thing is...

212
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,125
one man thrashing a dozen bad guys and a
dozen hot girls falling for one man...

213
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,542
doesn't click with the audience.

214
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:13,458
Real films are those that
compel the audience to think.

215
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,292
The audience wants to
feel something else...

216
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,958
and you want them to feel their mind?

217
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,875
Sir...

218
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,458
Abraham sir deleted one song.

219
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,458
That song would have worked wonders.

220
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,250
Which song?

221
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,833
This one... take a look.

222
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:28,375
Let me watch it.

223
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,875
Dear friend...

224
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,208
you should go to Hollywood.

225
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:51,750
We will miss you but you should go.

226
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,000
You robbed the film of its life!

227
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,792
Life?

228
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,292
You mean... that fatso...

229
00:18:57,542 --> 00:18:59,958
I will add this song as
a special feature and...

230
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,708
release the film
again in smaller towns.

231
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,167
That will definitely
recover some money.

232
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,500
Abraham, what are you doing?

233
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,708
what are you doing?

234
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:11,792
Abraham... what are you doing?

235
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:12,708
What did you do that for?

236
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:20,542
You've set the positive on fire.

237
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,333
I still have the negative.

238
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:26,250
Mark my words, this girl
will set the screen on fire!

239
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,417
Hey, What are you doing?

240
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,750
I'm taking a picture.

241
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,417
You can't do that, get out!

242
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,458
Ticket, ticket...

243
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,750
Blackie!

244
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,875
Blackie... listen...

245
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:02,875
I want a ticket.

246
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,708
Not you again!

247
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:07,708
The amount you have spent
on watching this film...

248
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:09,583
would have got you the girl.

249
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,667
- Are you serious? - Of course!

250
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,417
Selva Ganesh has
proved once again that...

251
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:24,167
he will go to any
length to make money.

252
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,750
This is not a film,
it's a volley of abuses.

253
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,000
This is the respect that I like.

254
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:37,958
The more these critics pan my film,
the more my film will earn for me.

255
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,208
Well done, Vimal. Good job.

256
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:41,375
Thank you, sir.

257
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:43,167
I want this girl.

258
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,583
If merely her glimpse can
arouse the crowd to this extent...

259
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:48,958
imagine what will happen if
she danced to an entire song!

260
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:49,833
Get her.

261
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:52,583
But sir, I don't know who
she is or where she came from.

262
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,000
Well then, find out.

263
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:55,250
I'm sure someone knows.

264
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:58,042
If she is present in the song, surely
she hasn't appeared out of thin air.

265
00:20:58,292 --> 00:20:59,042
Find her!

266
00:20:59,125 --> 00:20:59,958
Yes, sir.

267
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:04,208
This girl will be my
biggest discovery.

268
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,792
Who is it?

269
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:08,833
What is it?

270
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:10,875
G...G...G...

271
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,583
G... G... what? Who are you?

272
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,458
What do you want?

273
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:19,917
Money!

274
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:22,625
What's this?

275
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:26,083
That's one less than hundred.

276
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:27,458
Why?

277
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,708
I bought this for one rupee.

278
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,125
Are you high? Should I
bring you back to reality?

279
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,250
Forgot everything?

280
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:37,583
Film... I saw your film.

281
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:42,000
Ever since then I've
been saving up for you.

282
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:44,750
You are lying!

283
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,250
I haven't acted in any film.

284
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,833
Go away from here...

285
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,375
get lost!

286
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,292
The middle word in life is... "if".

287
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:04,667
The big "if'!

288
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:07,833
If only that bastard Selva Ganesh
had spent five more minutes..

289
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:09,167
..in the bathroom...

290
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,833
if only he had driven 5 kmph slower...

291
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,292
everybody's life would
have remained the same.

292
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:16,583
But no.

293
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:19,125
He was eager to screw me and how!

294
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:23,792
Even sitting on a
couch didn't feel safe.

295
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:27,250
The sun arose that morning
to shine bright on Reshma...

296
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,875
and to burn me to ashes.

297
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,125
Baby, should I call for more?

298
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:36,917
Enough, Amma.

299
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,833
Baby, all the people who've had
breakfast with me in the past...

300
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:43,958
today enjoy dinner at 5-star hotels.

301
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:49,208
Join hands with me and the world
will praise you with hands joined.

302
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:51,250
Have some more... keep eating.

303
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,833
And you will be the best.

304
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:56,500
I can see it, you have that...

305
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,417
desire.

306
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,167
Silk!

307
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,500
Today onwards your name is Silk.

308
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,083
And your name is Mr. Worm.

309
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:29,542
What?

310
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:32,083
Silk is created by worms.

311
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,750
Baby, whether I'm
Selva Ganesh or Mr. Worm...

312
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:42,208
but all I am is an
opportunity for you.

313
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:45,042
And this opportunity
won't come by again...

314
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:48,667
it will only go to someone else.

315
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,000
Okay, sir...

316
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:48,042
music...

317
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:52,125
One, two, three, four...

318
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:09,875
Silk, no heat...

319
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:11,083
no heat!

320
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:13,833
We want to titillate the public...

321
00:26:14,292 --> 00:26:15,833
not put them to sleep.

322
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,542
And sir, extraordinary shot.

323
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:19,542
Sir, extraordinary...

324
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,167
but one more, sir, please.

325
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:31,583
Cut it!

326
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:32,958
Silk, what are you doing?

327
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:35,583
Imagine Surya sir is
a log of sandalwood.

328
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:36,917
And you are a serpent...

329
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:38,375
wrap yourself around him.

330
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:40,250
And Surya sir, very good shot.

331
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:42,667
But she's a newcomer, sir.
One more shot, sir, please.

332
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,583
George...

333
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:12,208
Surya gives only one take. That's it.

334
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:14,000
Here I am...

335
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,083
Sir, please, sir...

336
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:18,042
A day with Surya is worth
a hundred thousand rupees!

337
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:19,833
Understand?

338
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,208
A good looking fruit
isn't always sweet!

339
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,750
Set up my solo shot.

340
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:43,833
Hey you...

341
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:47,500
come here.

342
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:54,750
What's your name?

343
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,250
Reshma...

344
00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:57,958
Silk.

345
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,500
Two names to go by and you
can't do one silly step.

346
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:06,083
See this...

347
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:11,417
plastic cover?

348
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:15,125
Whether it's there or not...

349
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:18,500
it makes no
difference to the cigarette.

350
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:22,375
Similarly...

351
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:26,458
whether you are in this film or not...
it makes no difference to anyone.

352
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:32,333
You know something...

353
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:37,625
if there's no cover and it rains...

354
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:39,625
the cigarette won't even light up.

355
00:28:43,042 --> 00:28:43,875
Pack up!

356
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,500
Heroine says that it's going to rain.

357
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:55,750
I've been hit by a
shoe because of you.

358
00:28:56,042 --> 00:28:56,833
But I won't let it happen again.

359
00:28:57,417 --> 00:28:59,167
You made Surya sir very angry.

360
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:00,833
You go!

361
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:03,042
And don't ever come back.

362
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:16,917
What are you doing in here?

363
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:20,875
I'm here to get tuned, and
then we can make some music.

364
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:24,750
You switched your
melody pretty quickly.

365
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:28,750
It's your personality, sir.

366
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,292
I've been admiring you
since I was a little girl.

367
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:35,875
I was scared to be next to you.

368
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:40,583
Now that's believable.

369
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:44,417
If God puts in an appearance...

370
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,167
the devotee is bound to be scared.

371
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:50,708
Sir, please give me another chance.

372
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,292
Why should 1?

373
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,500
I'll be devoted to you.

374
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:57,500
I'll do anything you want me to.

375
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:03,583
Don't you read the magazines?

376
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:06,500
The magazines say that...

377
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:13,500
I've tuned 500 girls.

378
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:24,583
But have you ever
tuned one girl 500 times?

379
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:35,042
- Is it true about the 500... - No...

380
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,833
501!

381
00:30:52,292 --> 00:30:54,167
Sir, Surya won't act with her.

382
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:56,208
Sir, there they come.

383
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:04,875
I guess Surya sir is all charged up.

384
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:10,625
Suryakant may die but he
won't let go of a new girl.

385
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:20,458
Cut...

386
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:21,292
What?

387
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:27,167
She's doing it all wrong again,
she missed a beat.

388
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:33,042
To hell with the beat,
look at that heat...

389
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:34,583
she'll set everyone on fire.

390
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:57,042
Extraordinary, sir, very good, sir.

391
00:31:57,292 --> 00:32:00,500
Mind-blowing, sir,
very good shot, sir.

392
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:15,750
Madam...

393
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,583
ticket please.

394
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:21,625
That's your seat, sit there.

395
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,667
How does it matter?
This place is empty.

396
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,917
I don't want problems later.

397
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,875
Go and sit according to your ticket.

398
00:34:12,542 --> 00:34:13,542
Mother...

399
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:16,167
congratulate me.

400
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,542
Your son has stood first in college.

401
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:20,792
Bless you, my dear.

402
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:23,625
You've fulfilled all my wishes.

403
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:25,833
If only your dad were alive today...

404
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:32,292
Cut it!

405
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:34,250
Very good shot, Surya sir.

406
00:34:35,042 --> 00:34:36,250
Excellent shot.

407
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:38,125
Just like a young boy.

408
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,292
That was... that was very good.

409
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:43,625
You are very convincing as my mother.

410
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:51,875
Naylaji!

411
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,750
What a pleasure, what brings you here?

412
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:58,750
Last month's
magazine hasn't sold well?

413
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:01,083
Probably because you
didn't grace the cover!

414
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:06,292
So what's brewing... under cover?

415
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:14,292
This is new!

416
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:18,458
Lalitha was the heroine in your
last film and both of you were hot.

417
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:21,375
And now she is playing your mother?

418
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:23,042
You see...

419
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:25,125
youth is meant to be tasted...

420
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,500
not wasted!

421
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,750
A heroine's life...

422
00:35:30,292 --> 00:35:32,500
is like an elected government.

423
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:34,792
The party lasts for five years...

424
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:36,167
after that it's there for support.

425
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,917
Sometimes left... sometimes right...

426
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:41,458
and sometimes even centre!

427
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:49,042
I've heard that new girl, Silk, is a
passionate supporter of your party.

428
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:52,042
Everybody is talking about her.

429
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,917
Of course, I gave her a break.

430
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:57,417
She is very talented.

431
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:04,917
When God has blessed
her so abundantly...

432
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:07,083
there's no harm in
taking a piece of the pie.

433
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:08,458
Right?

434
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,458
You know me...

435
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:17,500
I believe the more I can be of
help to others, the better it is.

436
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:20,250
But she is a quite down market.

437
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:21,792
You write up on her was perfect.

438
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:24,042
Well, I have to, Surya sir.

439
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:27,500
To portray men as saints...

440
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:30,333
women have to be depicted as demons.

441
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:32,042
Sir, madam is here.

442
00:36:32,417 --> 00:36:33,667
Yes.

443
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,292
See you later.

444
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:38,375
What about my interview?

445
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:39,833
We'll do it later.

446
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:43,292
This is important.

447
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,292
Quick, some filter coffee for madam.

448
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,333
Is Silk here?

449
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:01,875
The cinema hall was filled with men...

450
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,417
every one of them only to see me.

451
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:07,000
And as soon as the
song was over, they left.

452
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:08,625
It was amazing.

453
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:12,750
Don't be so excited.

454
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:18,042
Take a look at what
Nayla has to say about you.

455
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:18,708
Who is Nayla?

456
00:37:18,792 --> 00:37:21,833
The most important film
critic and gossip queen.

457
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,708
When she writes,
everybody pays attention.

458
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:34,917
She says Selva took the
help of dirt to sell his film.

459
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:37,167
Dirt...

460
00:37:37,292 --> 00:37:38,833
that's you.

461
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:43,583
Look at my picture, it's so gorgeous.

462
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:45,458
Now, I will stop at nothing.

463
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:48,250
Help me with more work...

464
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:53,208
But why should I help you?

465
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:57,542
Because I love you and...

466
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,917
we still have 499 times
remaining to get tuned.

467
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,542
Come in...

468
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,167
So, Akbar and Anarkali
are on talking terms?

469
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,000
Sir, good sense of humour, sir.

470
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:20,458
Abraham, this is Silk.

471
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,917
Hello.

472
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:25,583
Surya sir, I want to talk
to you about my next film.

473
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:28,000
And this film will showcase you.

474
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:31,333
You won't need a cheap and
disgusting act to promote this film.

475
00:38:39,292 --> 00:38:43,250
Abraham, everybody
knows you make good films.

476
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:44,875
Thank you, sir.

477
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:46,542
I owe it all to idli, rasam and rum.

478
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:50,375
But your films aren't...

479
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,125
commercially successful.

480
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,375
They captivate the
audience at film festivals but...

481
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:01,292
they fail to bring in even
a dog at local theatres.

482
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:02,417
Is that right?

483
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:03,792
Right, sir.

484
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:08,125
Spice it up, Abraham, spice it up.

485
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:10,000
Add some sex.

486
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:13,500
Have Silk dance to a number
or two, whatever you like.

487
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:15,042
Let me tell you...

488
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:17,875
successful films are those that...

489
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,042
have the right spice.

490
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:21,167
Right, Selva?

491
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,125
You are genius, sir.

492
00:39:23,417 --> 00:39:26,792
It's a curse, Selva. It's a curse.

493
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:28,583
Sir, I'm a director, not a pimp.

494
00:39:30,042 --> 00:39:32,375
I want to make a film, not sell sex.

495
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,583
Perhaps you can work with
that cheap girl but I can't!

496
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:40,458
Right.

497
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,167
Fine, Selva you direct it.

498
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:46,667
Okay, sir.

499
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:49,917
Then bye.

500
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:55,208
I wasn't dejected that
they chose Silk over me...

501
00:39:56,208 --> 00:40:00,583
I was dejected that
they decided so quickly.

502
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,125
Why do you have a problem with me?

503
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:09,333
I have a problem with your parents.

504
00:40:10,417 --> 00:40:12,000
They shouldn't have
given birth to you.

505
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:16,375
My parents didn't give birth to me.

506
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:20,458
Silk was brought into this world...

507
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:22,458
by the people who admire me.

508
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:30,583
Your admirers occupy the
first four rows in a cinema hall.

509
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:33,125
The 40 rows at the back are mine.

510
00:40:34,292 --> 00:40:38,333
I will prove that films don't
need gimmicks like you to sell.

511
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:42,667
Films need three things to sell...

512
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:46,792
entertainment,
entertainment, entertainment!

513
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,958
And I am entertainment.

514
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,000
A woman is like a rainbow.

515
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:00,125
As many faces as the colors.

516
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:03,792
Some consider her a lottery.

517
00:41:04,292 --> 00:41:06,958
If you win, you've hit the jackpot!

518
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,375
Some think of her as love.

519
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:12,250
If you fall in love with her...

520
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:13,958
you will gasp for every breath!

521
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:17,292
But she ravaged me like poison.

522
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:22,375
That now even water
burns me up from inside!

523
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:52,000
Your sweet torment

524
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:54,042
surreptitious torment

525
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:56,375
Here and around

526
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,958
I am angry

527
00:41:58,042 --> 00:41:59,875
you are the reason

528
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:04,042
Cajole me my love

529
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:07,292
I will tease you

530
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,875
you are a bombastic girl

531
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:11,583
Aha Aha Aha

532
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:15,917
Ooh la la, Ooh la Ia,
Ooh lala, Ooh lala

533
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,458
You are my fantasy

534
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:23,375
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

535
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,917
I am a young lady now

536
00:42:27,042 --> 00:42:31,125
Ooh la la, Ooh la Ia,
Ooh lala, Ooh lala

537
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:34,833
You are my fantasy

538
00:42:34,917 --> 00:42:38,667
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

539
00:42:38,792 --> 00:42:42,333
I am a young lady now

540
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:10,875
When touched by you

541
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:12,583
my heart whistled

542
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:16,292
Give me a sweet kiss on my cheeks

543
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:18,500
When touched by you

544
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:20,125
my heart whistled

545
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:24,125
Give me a sweet kiss on my cheeks

546
00:43:24,208 --> 00:43:27,958
Your youth, is fluid

547
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:31,250
which has drenched my heart

548
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:33,958
Aha you brought the rain

549
00:43:34,042 --> 00:43:37,750
what could my poor youth do?

550
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:41,583
Ooh la la, Ooh la Ia,
Ooh lala, Ooh lala

551
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:44,042
You are my fantasy

552
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:45,417
No no no no no

553
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,167
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

554
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:53,042
I am a young lady now

555
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:15,042
By dropping your saree repeatedly

556
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:22,917
you make me restless

557
00:44:23,042 --> 00:44:30,000
By dropping your saree repeatedly

558
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:37,708
you make me restless

559
00:44:37,792 --> 00:44:40,292
After storming a fire in me

560
00:44:40,417 --> 00:44:43,708
what can the poor saree do

561
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:45,500
Poor thing

562
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:47,167
Oh poor thing

563
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,042
I will tease you

564
00:44:51,167 --> 00:44:54,333
you are a bombastic girl

565
00:44:54,417 --> 00:44:55,542
Oh no

566
00:44:55,708 --> 00:44:59,750
Ooh la la, Ooh la Ia,
Ooh lala, Ooh lala

567
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:02,583
You are my fantasy

568
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:03,542
Ah ah

569
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:07,125
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

570
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:09,167
I am a young lady now

571
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,917
Hey hey hey hey

572
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,792
Ooh la la, Ooh la Ia,
Ooh lala, Ooh lala

573
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:17,750
You are my fantasy

574
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:18,458
Oh oh

575
00:45:18,542 --> 00:45:22,667
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

576
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:27,042
I am a young lady now

577
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:29,208
You want to interview me?

578
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:32,542
At my place?

579
00:45:32,917 --> 00:45:35,417
This evening... great!

580
00:45:38,292 --> 00:45:38,917
- Amma... - What is it?

581
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,292
it was a call from Manorama magazine.

582
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:41,917
They want to interview me.

583
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:44,583
They want to show the
world how stars live.

584
00:45:45,292 --> 00:45:46,917
No film star lives like you do.

585
00:45:47,042 --> 00:45:48,250
Refuse them.

586
00:45:48,542 --> 00:45:50,875
Amma, these opportunities
don't come by again and again...

587
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:52,917
they will only pass
on to someone else.

588
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,417
What will you show?

589
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:55,917
The tiny room you live in?

590
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:05,375
I brought this deer from Africa.

591
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:06,708
Superb, sir.

592
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:10,750
This gun is an antique from Bulgaria.

593
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:19,167
Sir, deep breath, stomach in.

594
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:29,250
Click my picture...

595
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:30,917
Click my picture...

596
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,333
Go away... get lost!

597
00:46:36,792 --> 00:46:39,583
Oops... you're early.

598
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:41,250
Ma'am...

599
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:42,250
I can come back later.

600
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:44,667
Now that you are here,
let's begin the interview.

601
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:46,792
You mean like this?

602
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:49,500
But have you worn something?

603
00:46:52,292 --> 00:46:54,458
Do you bathe with your clothes on?

604
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:56,750
No.

605
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:57,750
Exactly!

606
00:46:58,417 --> 00:47:00,750
Having a bath with your
clothes on is cheating...

607
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:02,792
and Silk doesn't cheat.

608
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:06,417
What you see is what you get!

609
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:19,083
What are you doing?

610
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:21,375
You are only taking my pictures

611
00:47:21,792 --> 00:47:23,000
What about my house?

612
00:47:23,167 --> 00:47:25,417
When the goddess is
present in her full glory...

613
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:27,917
who cares about the temple?

614
00:47:45,042 --> 00:47:50,083
Thanks to Silk I was out of work.

615
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:53,542
All day and night
she danced in my mind.

616
00:47:54,042 --> 00:47:56,292
But she didn't care a
damn about these things.

617
00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:57,417
She was running in a race...

618
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,042
where you must look straight ahead.

619
00:48:00,042 --> 00:48:01,167
Sir...

620
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:04,792
Silk is very good at
creating headlines.

621
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:07,083
But this isn't right, sir.

622
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:09,792
A girl, that too an actress...

623
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:11,667
moreover on the front page!

624
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:13,292
Bad news, sir.

625
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:15,250
She's flying high.

626
00:48:17,042 --> 00:48:18,417
Let her.

627
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:21,500
No matter how high the popcorn goes...

628
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:24,458
it always falls back in the pan.

629
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:27,458
Excellent, sir, excellent!

630
00:48:27,542 --> 00:48:29,125
That's brilliant!

631
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:33,833
What are you looking for?

632
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:38,375
Someone from Manorama
had interviewed me too...

633
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,500
but those idiots
didn't print anything!

634
00:48:49,042 --> 00:48:50,458
When will you grow up?

635
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,500
You brought all this
to your new house too!

636
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:55,208
What if Surya sees it?

637
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:57,333
He will be pleased
that before I met him...

638
00:48:57,417 --> 00:48:59,917
I would make do with his pictures.

639
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:03,042
Surya and you are worlds apart.

640
00:49:03,667 --> 00:49:04,417
I'm worried.

641
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:06,875
A thousand girls like
you are crazy for him.

642
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:10,208
And a thousand guys
like him are crazy for me.

643
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,333
What's to worry?

644
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:13,292
We have the world at our feet.

645
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:16,458
He has another life...

646
00:49:16,542 --> 00:49:17,708
he is married.

647
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:22,208
If I had met him earlier,
perhaps he would have married me...

648
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:24,125
and I would've been his wife's place.

649
00:49:24,917 --> 00:49:27,750
"If", ‘perhaps', 'l would've been'...

650
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:32,167
when these words crop up in love,
it's better to step back.

651
00:49:33,292 --> 00:49:36,500
Amma, I know I don't
have any right on Surya.

652
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,083
But what can I do?

653
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:40,167
There are no brakes in love.

654
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,958
Let's talk about something else, Amma.

655
00:49:42,042 --> 00:49:44,708
You know something, sit...

656
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:45,792
do you hear that?

657
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,708
What?
- Listen carefully.

658
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,375
I don't hear anything.

659
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,875
Precisely! That's the
best part of living here.

660
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:57,792
You don't hear the
neighbours and no unwanted sounds.

661
00:50:17,167 --> 00:50:18,833
Silk, make it more seductive.

662
00:50:30,417 --> 00:50:32,708
This scene should
make the public go wild.

663
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:34,083
Make it hot.

664
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:38,750
Leave me!

665
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:50,917
Mr. Worm, take your shot.

666
00:51:50,667 --> 00:51:52,125
That was fantastic.

667
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:54,042
What a shot!

668
00:51:55,042 --> 00:51:56,750
Very good, very good...

669
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:02,958
So Silk...

670
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,583
were you thinking about Surya sir?

671
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:12,000
Why think about someone, with
whom I can be whenever I want to!

672
00:52:17,875 --> 00:52:21,000
Ratnamma, I have
dialogues in this film.

673
00:52:21,917 --> 00:52:23,333
I'm very nervous.

674
00:52:23,542 --> 00:52:24,750
Why?

675
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:27,583
People will laugh at me.

676
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:31,125
Why did the Worm
have to have a premiere?

677
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,500
I won't attend the premiere.

678
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:34,375
Why not?

679
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:36,333
Ratnamma, I'm a dancer.

680
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:39,042
I don't even have the
‘ting' of acting in me.

681
00:52:41,208 --> 00:52:42,750
You listen to me
nothing will happen...

682
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:43,708
I know her... listen to me.

683
00:52:43,917 --> 00:52:45,417
Let me at least talk to her.

684
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,917
- Silk madam... - You can't go in.

685
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,167
Ratnamma... I'll call you later.

686
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:50,875
Just let me talk to her!

687
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:54,833
Silk madam... Silk madam!

688
00:52:57,042 --> 00:52:58,417
Madam...

689
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:01,333
how are you, madam?

690
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:07,708
You!

691
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:09,917
Silk madam... how are you?

692
00:53:10,042 --> 00:53:11,833
I'm good.

693
00:53:11,917 --> 00:53:14,458
God is playing games with me.

694
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:16,792
I thought...

695
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,750
a thousand rupees
might be enough but...

696
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,667
you... you seem to be... very rich.

697
00:53:25,417 --> 00:53:27,875
Even a million won't be enough.

698
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:33,500
You know something...

699
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,750
you've been lucky for me.

700
00:53:36,792 --> 00:53:38,417
Every time you appear...

701
00:53:38,542 --> 00:53:40,500
something good definitely happens.

702
00:53:47,667 --> 00:53:50,042
Now you're leaving me high and dry.

703
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:52,958
I'm giving the security
guard a thousand for the kiss.

704
00:53:53,042 --> 00:53:54,958
Thanks a lot, madam.

705
00:53:55,042 --> 00:53:57,250
You are very nice.

706
00:54:02,417 --> 00:54:06,042
Some people make
films touch the heart.

707
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:09,042
Some people make films touch the mind.

708
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,458
The body part they wanted to touch...

709
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:14,750
well, this film was a hit there!

710
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,208
Thank you...

711
00:54:25,417 --> 00:54:27,458
- Very nice. - You liked it?

712
00:54:30,208 --> 00:54:31,458
What a film, what a film!

713
00:54:31,542 --> 00:54:32,500
You liked it?

714
00:54:32,792 --> 00:54:33,875
Like?

715
00:54:35,042 --> 00:54:37,958
I haven't seen such a
disgusting film in my life.

716
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:40,583
There's something nice
and superb about this film.

717
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:41,417
Silk?

718
00:54:43,417 --> 00:54:48,208
Now you will realise that to make a
good film you need a good director...

719
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:49,333
not a dancer!

720
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:50,917
But don't you worry.

721
00:54:51,042 --> 00:54:52,083
You think this film will do well?

722
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:53,917
Not a chance.

723
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:58,667
But I am still
willing to work with you..

724
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,042
because you gave me my first break.

725
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,042
Here...

726
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:06,125
have this and...

727
00:55:06,958 --> 00:55:08,417
even the abuses will sound sweet.

728
00:55:11,917 --> 00:55:13,583
Mr. Worm!

729
00:55:16,792 --> 00:55:18,542
That bastard ripped everything apart!

730
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:20,167
Forget about him.

731
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:22,750
I am sure even his
alcohol is as bad as him.

732
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:24,292
But...

733
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:27,083
what if his words come true?

734
00:55:28,417 --> 00:55:31,167
We haven't made this film for him.

735
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:34,417
Our fate will be decided on Friday.

736
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:02,833
Industry has sunk to new lows...

737
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:05,708
thanks to Selva Ganesh and...

738
00:56:05,792 --> 00:56:08,167
more importantly Silk.

739
00:56:08,375 --> 00:56:09,792
By Nayla.

740
00:56:26,042 --> 00:56:29,125
Down with Silk!

741
00:56:29,208 --> 00:56:34,125
Down with Silk!

742
00:56:57,792 --> 00:56:59,208
Hello Silk...

743
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,458
It's been so long.

744
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,083
Is this the first time you're here?

745
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,417
You act very well even in reality!

746
00:57:07,542 --> 00:57:09,375
Sir, a little closer, please.

747
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,958
Yes, that's fine.

748
00:57:13,167 --> 00:57:14,208
Let's go inside.

749
00:57:14,333 --> 00:57:15,875
The action always takes place inside.

750
00:57:19,125 --> 00:57:21,083
All night you stick to me like glue...

751
00:57:21,292 --> 00:57:23,417
otherwise you don't
even want to hold me.

752
00:57:24,167 --> 00:57:24,833
Hello...

753
00:57:24,917 --> 00:57:26,542
Control yourself, Silk.

754
00:57:26,667 --> 00:57:27,958
The people here know me.

755
00:57:28,042 --> 00:57:30,542
If my wife hears about this,
it won't be good.

756
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:33,792
See you later at the farmhouse.

757
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:35,333
So, now what?

758
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:40,208
Enjoy the race.

759
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,542
Lay a bet on a good horse.

760
00:57:44,042 --> 00:57:46,125
I've bet on you.

761
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:48,042
Don't let me down.

762
00:57:48,542 --> 00:57:50,417
Evening... farmhouse.

763
00:57:51,417 --> 00:57:52,875
That's Silk.

764
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,375
What is she doing here?

765
00:57:54,458 --> 00:57:56,750
Are people like her allowed in here?

766
00:57:56,833 --> 00:58:00,375
Let alone her films, I
don't even look at the posters!

767
00:58:05,083 --> 00:58:06,208
You!

768
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:09,042
You are... here at the race course...

769
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:10,000
Why not?

770
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:11,542
Can't I come to the race course?

771
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:13,083
I'm a star too.

772
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:15,417
You think only these
well dressed people

773
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,792
with their English
accents can come here?

774
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:19,458
You are Silk, aren't you?

775
00:58:19,542 --> 00:58:21,042
Yes, so what?

776
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:23,208
I am your fan.

777
00:58:25,542 --> 00:58:29,417
I didn't think
anybody here would know me.

778
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:32,250
Apart from a dozen
horses and a few asses...

779
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:35,042
there's no one here
who doesn't know you.

780
00:58:38,042 --> 00:58:39,333
Thank you.

781
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:51,125
I want to lay a wager
that number 9 will win.

782
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:52,333
How do I do it?

783
00:58:52,792 --> 00:58:55,333
Silk madam, don't bet on that horse.

784
00:58:55,417 --> 00:58:56,833
This horse has never won.

785
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:58,667
Nobody has ever bet on him.

786
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:00,417
Did anyone imagine that
India would defeat West Indies

787
00:59:00,542 --> 00:59:02,542
in the cricket world cup final?

788
00:59:02,708 --> 00:59:03,583
But India won!

789
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:06,167
If nobody bets on him,
why will he win?

790
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,000
He's a horse, not an ass.

791
00:59:08,292 --> 00:59:09,833
Here's the money.

792
00:59:12,792 --> 00:59:14,042
It will.

793
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:19,000
Ramakant sir...

794
00:59:19,083 --> 00:59:21,458
finally someone bet on your horse.

795
00:59:21,542 --> 00:59:23,708
This horse never won a race for me...

796
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:26,417
but I hope he wins this race for Silk.

797
00:59:51,792 --> 00:59:55,167
Come on come on, Mountain Storm.

798
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:41,042
At night you prefer to be like
the hands of a clock at 12 o'clock.

799
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:45,208
But during the day,
your clock says 6 o'clock.

800
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,708
I have to control, Silk.

801
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:51,750
Yesterday if we were seen together...

802
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:53,375
you would've lost nothing...

803
01:00:53,458 --> 01:00:55,333
but I would've lost everything.

804
01:00:56,042 --> 01:00:57,250
So, which horse did you bet on?

805
01:00:58,667 --> 01:00:59,542
The horse that won.

806
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:05,167
I'm the horse that wins.

807
01:01:17,042 --> 01:01:20,708
- Surya! - Radhika!

808
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:24,542
Go hide in there...

809
01:01:31,542 --> 01:01:32,125
Surya!

810
01:01:32,208 --> 01:01:33,375
Yes? Just coming...

811
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,208
Go in will you...

812
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:37,208
Go in...

813
01:01:54,917 --> 01:01:57,458
Press my head no one does it like you.

814
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,125
Silk never took the easy path.

815
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:52,167
Then how could her life ever be easy?

816
01:02:53,917 --> 01:02:55,792
She had broken a million hearts...

817
01:02:56,583 --> 01:02:58,208
and now her heart was at stake.

818
01:02:59,875 --> 01:03:03,000
People say only the heart
breaks but they're wrong.

819
01:03:03,792 --> 01:03:05,708
Every single part of the
body goes into mourning.

820
01:03:06,542 --> 01:03:08,125
The throat becomes dry...

821
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:10,542
and cheeks remain cold...

822
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:12,417
eyes welled up with tears...

823
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,208
and heart... empty.

824
01:03:16,917 --> 01:03:19,667
I learnt about Silk's
misery much later...

825
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:22,875
otherwise I would've celebrated.

826
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:46,083
Excuse me!

827
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:51,375
Are you alright?

828
01:03:52,292 --> 01:03:53,667
Why wouldn't I be?

829
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:56,875
Should I get a taxi for you?

830
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,458
Why? Don't you have a car?

831
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:01,542
You... will come along... with me?

832
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:04,917
Why not? Are you going to rape me?

833
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:05,958
What?

834
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:07,542
Why would you say that?

835
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:10,333
Excuse me...

836
01:04:13,417 --> 01:04:14,667
just a minute, please.

837
01:04:27,417 --> 01:04:28,542
Don't worry. Just do it.

838
01:04:29,417 --> 01:04:30,042
What?

839
01:04:30,667 --> 01:04:33,292
You aren't the first man to think...

840
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:36,583
‘while shifting the gear if
I could somehow touch her.'

841
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:39,292
What... no...

842
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,000
I wasn't thinking of that.

843
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:45,042
You work for Suryakant?

844
01:04:45,917 --> 01:04:47,083
I'm his brother.

845
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:52,917
Suryakant... Ramakant...

846
01:04:53,417 --> 01:04:54,750
brothers.

847
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:58,125
Did you see his wife go in?

848
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:00,208
Yes.

849
01:05:02,208 --> 01:05:04,000
That's when you figured that...

850
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:08,000
since the permanent one
is in, I will sneak out.

851
01:05:09,542 --> 01:05:11,708
One brother takes me to bed and...

852
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:13,875
the other is
erecting a bed in his mind!

853
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:19,250
Why are your
thoughts always so twisted?

854
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:24,042
Because virtue doesn't
stand a chance in this world.

855
01:05:26,667 --> 01:05:27,500
What do you do?

856
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,417
I'm a writer. I write.

857
01:05:29,875 --> 01:05:31,292
Which was your last film?

858
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:33,750
I haven't got the first one yet.

859
01:05:35,167 --> 01:05:36,125
And you'll never get one.

860
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,750
Why not?

861
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:42,208
According to you, there's
only one hero in your family.

862
01:05:42,958 --> 01:05:44,250
And that's Suryakant.

863
01:05:46,458 --> 01:05:48,125
According to you, who is he?

864
01:05:48,792 --> 01:05:50,167
Hero or...

865
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:52,167
a villain?

866
01:05:53,292 --> 01:05:56,500
I've given up classifying people.

867
01:05:57,083 --> 01:05:58,500
Moreover...

868
01:05:58,792 --> 01:06:01,208
the hero and villain don't matter...

869
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:03,208
because I'm the vamp in every story.

870
01:06:08,542 --> 01:06:09,750
I want to go home...

871
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:11,750
will you take me there?

872
01:06:12,042 --> 01:06:13,750
Yes.

873
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,042
You see that window?

874
01:07:04,542 --> 01:07:08,500
I escaped from it on
the eve of my wedding.

875
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:13,542
Won't you go in?

876
01:07:41,875 --> 01:07:42,917
Mother...

877
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:24,375
This award goes to Silk.

878
01:08:24,458 --> 01:08:26,042
And to give this award...

879
01:08:26,167 --> 01:08:28,417
I would like to call Mr. Suryakant.

880
01:08:36,333 --> 01:08:39,500
I want to present an award to the
person who chose Silk for this award.

881
01:08:41,292 --> 01:08:42,708
She is despicable and...

882
01:08:43,333 --> 01:08:45,417
the person who chose her even worse.

883
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:47,875
But mister... who the hell are you?

884
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:50,542
Abraham...

885
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:51,708
director.

886
01:08:52,167 --> 01:08:53,667
Been a long time since I saw you.

887
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:55,750
I finally realised...

888
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:57,417
where to be seen and where not.

889
01:08:57,958 --> 01:09:00,083
Success has gone to your head.

890
01:09:00,875 --> 01:09:03,375
But many like you have come and gone.

891
01:09:03,792 --> 01:09:05,458
I haven't come here to go away.

892
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:08,292
Look, I'm up here and
the others are down there.

893
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:11,917
You think the people
down there adore you?

894
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:14,708
They are laughing at you.

895
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,458
They know very well that
you don't belong with us.

896
01:09:19,208 --> 01:09:21,000
You are the fantasy from last night..

897
01:09:21,083 --> 01:09:24,000
..that nobody talks about
the next morning.

898
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:30,000
You are our dirty secret!

899
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:33,958
At least say thanks...

900
01:09:45,542 --> 01:09:47,917
I really don't know
where to begin from.

901
01:09:49,333 --> 01:09:52,583
If I begin right at the start,
my mother will be hurt.

902
01:09:54,375 --> 01:09:57,250
If I talk about the present,
you might feel offended.

903
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,792
Because today I won't stop.

904
01:10:06,208 --> 01:10:09,125
Everybody's right eye is twitching
and heart on the left is throbbing...

905
01:10:09,208 --> 01:10:11,208
anticipating what I'm about to say.

906
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:17,083
You must be
wondering why you ever put...

907
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:19,583
a nobody like me on a pedestal.

908
01:10:21,667 --> 01:10:24,250
Some people are famous
because of what they do.

909
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,917
I'm infamous for what I do.

910
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:29,042
Vulgar...

911
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:30,292
disgusting...

912
01:10:30,542 --> 01:10:31,292
sexy...

913
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:32,667
dirty...

914
01:10:33,042 --> 01:10:34,750
the words that are
applied to describe me.

915
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:38,042
Just so someone's
film could take off...

916
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:40,292
I was used as a boarding pass.

917
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:43,333
Yet people say I'm vulgar.

918
01:10:44,292 --> 01:10:46,042
You made me dance...

919
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:50,042
but nobody noticed my
effort or my sincerity.

920
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:53,458
You were busy noticing something else.

921
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,583
Yet you label me disgusting...

922
01:10:58,167 --> 01:10:59,500
sexy...

923
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:03,083
My films are not meant to be
watched with the family but...

924
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:09,458
people watch them alone and
end up with a bigger family.

925
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:13,875
If I open a few buttons...

926
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:16,542
then everyone will break into a sweat.

927
01:11:18,125 --> 01:11:19,292
Don't you worry...

928
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:21,333
I'm leaving...

929
01:11:22,875 --> 01:11:26,292
because except for me,
everyone else here is honourable.

930
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:40,167
But I must say, your
honour is unbelievable.

931
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:43,000
You make films about sex,
you sell them...

932
01:11:43,083 --> 01:11:45,083
you watch them, you show them...

933
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:46,292
you even present them with awards...

934
01:11:46,792 --> 01:11:48,708
but you're scared to acknowledge them.

935
01:11:49,167 --> 01:11:52,250
Neither will you change, nor will I.

936
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:56,000
Wrap yourself with your
so-called-honour and...

937
01:11:57,042 --> 01:11:59,333
I will carry on shedding my clothes.

938
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,500
I will continue making
these Dirty Pictures.

939
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:09,042
And I will bring these
Dirty Pictures before you.

940
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:21,958
Who are you?

941
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:23,208
Nayla.

942
01:12:23,458 --> 01:12:24,583
Oh!

943
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,500
So it is you who writes
all the bad stuff about me.

944
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:32,875
It will be bad if I
stop writing about you.

945
01:12:34,042 --> 01:12:34,792
What do you mean?

946
01:12:35,125 --> 01:12:36,167
I mean...

947
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:39,500
what you're doing
today is a rebellion.

948
01:12:40,083 --> 01:12:42,208
Years later people
will call it freedom.

949
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:45,292
I don't get you.

950
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:47,000
Stay as you are...

951
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:48,458
like a storm...

952
01:12:49,083 --> 01:12:50,333
don't think too much.

953
01:12:51,042 --> 01:12:53,375
Because if you do, you'll fade away.

954
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:56,333
I am Silk.

955
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:59,792
I'm not some film that will
change after the interval.

956
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,917
That's Surya's wife and
she's coming towards us.

957
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:54,792
Finally I've met you.

958
01:13:55,417 --> 01:13:56,875
I've heard a lot about you.

959
01:13:57,625 --> 01:13:59,000
I'm sure you have...

960
01:13:59,083 --> 01:14:00,833
but there's a lot more to me.

961
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:07,250
I like you better in
person than on the screen.

962
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:10,417
I heard a lot about you
too and you're less either.

963
01:14:13,792 --> 01:14:15,417
He looks just like his father.

964
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:20,667
He even behaves like him.

965
01:14:21,792 --> 01:14:23,042
You have no idea...

966
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:25,375
what it is like to
be a superstar's wife.

967
01:14:25,917 --> 01:14:28,333
Even so there isn't a lot
of difference between us.

968
01:14:28,667 --> 01:14:29,958
No...

969
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:32,083
there is a lot of difference.

970
01:14:32,833 --> 01:14:34,042
No, Radhikaiji...

971
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,250
the difference is as big as a mole.

972
01:14:37,458 --> 01:14:39,667
I have a mole near my heart and...

973
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,583
you have one...

974
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,167
on what you sit.

975
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:46,250
What? How do you know?

976
01:14:46,542 --> 01:14:48,458
Your face gave it away.

977
01:14:49,042 --> 01:14:50,417
That you have a mole...

978
01:14:51,167 --> 01:14:52,625
right where I said it is.

979
01:15:11,208 --> 01:15:13,333
Hey writer boy!

980
01:15:13,417 --> 01:15:17,042
Are you going to stand by
your brother and not talk to me?

981
01:15:17,125 --> 01:15:19,375
You're pretending as
if you don't know me.

982
01:15:26,875 --> 01:15:28,000
What do you want?

983
01:15:28,083 --> 01:15:29,250
Tell me.

984
01:15:36,708 --> 01:15:38,000
What I want...

985
01:15:38,875 --> 01:15:40,958
can only be enjoyed at night.

986
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,167
Night?

987
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:43,417
Why not now?

988
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:46,958
What will people think?

989
01:15:48,417 --> 01:15:50,083
What will Surya think?

990
01:15:52,542 --> 01:15:54,375
Right here, right now?

991
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,542
This is between you and me.

992
01:16:00,583 --> 01:16:01,708
Actually...

993
01:16:01,792 --> 01:16:03,917
things didn't work out with Surya.

994
01:16:06,042 --> 01:16:08,000
Now it's all up to you.

995
01:16:08,917 --> 01:16:11,083
I'll see you at night... alone!

996
01:16:13,417 --> 01:16:14,542
What are you doing?

997
01:16:14,625 --> 01:16:15,792
You are doing it all wrong.

998
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:17,000
Do it right.

999
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:19,042
Don't hold it, let me do it.

1000
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:20,542
You're doing it all wrong.

1001
01:16:20,625 --> 01:16:21,917
I know how to slide it in.

1002
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,208
Is this your first time?

1003
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:24,458
Never mind me.

1004
01:16:24,542 --> 01:16:25,875
Slide it in properly.

1005
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:29,042
We haven't even moved
yet and you're all wet!

1006
01:16:29,125 --> 01:16:31,417
Whatever you do, do it nice and easy.

1007
01:16:31,667 --> 01:16:33,500
Now ease into first gear...

1008
01:16:33,917 --> 01:16:35,167
slowly.

1009
01:16:36,917 --> 01:16:40,042
Easy, yes... slowly...

1010
01:16:40,125 --> 01:16:42,708
Look straight ahead.

1011
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,875
slowly...

1012
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,458
Yes, that's the way.

1013
01:16:47,792 --> 01:16:49,625
Look straight ahead.

1014
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:52,708
What are you doing?

1015
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,750
Look straight ahead.

1016
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,667
Now add a little pressure on
this pedal, it's the accelerator.

1017
01:16:58,750 --> 01:16:59,875
Okay...

1018
01:17:05,583 --> 01:17:06,917
Thanks.

1019
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,917
Now that you've bought a car...

1020
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,625
you should've hired a driver as well.

1021
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:14,667
I bought the car from
the winnings at the derby.

1022
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:16,792
I can't decide whether...

1023
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:19,958
I should hire a driver or a jockey.

1024
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:23,375
Do you know that was my horse?

1025
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,792
Well then...

1026
01:17:24,875 --> 01:17:26,458
you are lucky for me.

1027
01:17:26,667 --> 01:17:27,917
No, you are lucky.

1028
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:33,125
I saw you whispering to
the horse before the race.

1029
01:17:34,042 --> 01:17:35,167
What did you say?

1030
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:37,333
It seemed depressed.

1031
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:40,917
I said nobody has
ever looked at my feet.

1032
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,667
Hold your head high and
leave everyone behind.

1033
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:48,625
And it did.

1034
01:17:52,833 --> 01:17:55,583
Your words are so loaded
with horsepower that...

1035
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:58,042
they rein in the wild spirit in men..

1036
01:17:58,125 --> 01:18:02,042
..While they revive
the sagging spirit of horses.

1037
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:04,125
Tell me...

1038
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,917
who holds your reins?

1039
01:18:07,792 --> 01:18:09,042
Meaning?

1040
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:12,250
If I spell it out, you'll blush.

1041
01:18:13,625 --> 01:18:15,333
Do you have a girlfriend?

1042
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:17,792
No.

1043
01:18:18,417 --> 01:18:19,542
Why not?

1044
01:18:21,375 --> 01:18:23,917
In the beginning,
a girlfriend is delicious as cream...

1045
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:27,583
but then she slowly
engulfs you like cholesterol...

1046
01:18:27,667 --> 01:18:30,000
and finally strikes
like a heart attack!

1047
01:18:35,792 --> 01:18:37,375
Fine, I'll see for myself...

1048
01:18:38,667 --> 01:18:44,625
how long an ascetical celibate like you
can resist the charms of a single woman.

1049
01:18:56,750 --> 01:19:00,458
Ooh la la, Ooh la Ia,
Ooh lala, Ooh lala

1050
01:19:00,542 --> 01:19:03,042
You are my fantasy

1051
01:19:03,125 --> 01:19:04,250
Ah ah

1052
01:19:04,375 --> 01:19:08,042
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

1053
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:10,042
I am a young lady now

1054
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:11,917
Hey hey hey hey

1055
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,708
Ooh la la, Ooh la Ia,
Ooh lala, Ooh lala

1056
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:18,208
You are my fantasy

1057
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:19,500
Oh oh

1058
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:23,333
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

1059
01:19:23,417 --> 01:19:27,042
I am a young lady now

1060
01:19:30,917 --> 01:19:34,417
Trying to meet you is like
jumping across an electric fence.

1061
01:19:35,458 --> 01:19:36,667
Sit.

1062
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:39,958
You can get a 440 volt shock anytime!

1063
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,458
Did you think I'm AAA battery?

1064
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:44,000
I'm a transformer.

1065
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:45,417
Transformer!

1066
01:19:46,667 --> 01:19:51,000
Are you planning on
giving me something lethal?

1067
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:53,417
Are you out of breath already?

1068
01:19:53,708 --> 01:19:55,333
You better save some.

1069
01:19:57,792 --> 01:19:59,000
What is this?

1070
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:01,042
Neither is it your birthday nor mine.

1071
01:20:01,125 --> 01:20:02,375
So what's this cake for?

1072
01:20:02,458 --> 01:20:04,958
Blow away your old life.

1073
01:20:05,792 --> 01:20:08,667
And wish your new
one a happy birthday.

1074
01:20:12,833 --> 01:20:14,542
What do you think you're doing?

1075
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:15,792
Are you okay?

1076
01:20:18,542 --> 01:20:21,708
Many who have gained fame
hide behind their black deeds.

1077
01:20:21,792 --> 01:20:24,000
At least you are covered in white.

1078
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:25,458
You are crazy.

1079
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:38,708
Happy Birthday.

1080
01:20:40,708 --> 01:20:43,500
- What are you doing! - To you too!

1081
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:49,250
Hello!

1082
01:20:53,917 --> 01:20:56,500
Hey guys, stop press now!

1083
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:58,625
Anything new about Silk?

1084
01:20:58,708 --> 01:21:01,333
I have something that
will create a sensation.

1085
01:21:01,417 --> 01:21:03,875
Tell us, Nayla. What did Silk do now?

1086
01:21:04,667 --> 01:21:06,000
I haven't thought about it.

1087
01:21:06,083 --> 01:21:07,375
About what?

1088
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,000
What do I label Silk?

1089
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:12,667
Manipulative or helpless?

1090
01:21:13,208 --> 01:21:15,958
Vamp or just a victim?

1091
01:21:18,167 --> 01:21:19,708
How are the pictures?

1092
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,458
I'll cut them out.

1093
01:21:21,542 --> 01:21:23,667
What about the
rubbish written about us?

1094
01:21:25,125 --> 01:21:27,458
I don't know what has been written.

1095
01:21:27,708 --> 01:21:30,167
In fact, I don't care and never did!

1096
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:34,417
I cut out the pictures,
but only if they are good.

1097
01:21:34,542 --> 01:21:37,083
A newspaper may go stale in a day...

1098
01:21:38,042 --> 01:21:40,417
but the news in it remains
fresh for years to come.

1099
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,875
And these journalists never
write anything good about you.

1100
01:21:47,042 --> 01:21:48,792
Now they've labelled you Draupadi.

1101
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:39,917
Ma'am...

1102
01:22:41,208 --> 01:22:42,625
Nayla madam is busy at the party.

1103
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:46,208
She said she can't meet anyone
and I shouldn't let anyone in.

1104
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:48,500
Didn't you tell her it's Silk?

1105
01:22:48,583 --> 01:22:51,208
Yes, ma'am, I know you. I told her.

1106
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:53,792
What's this party about?

1107
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:56,708
Ma'am, the party is to celebrate
Nayla madam's best journalist award.

1108
01:22:56,833 --> 01:22:58,333
A lot of high profile people
and celebrities are present.

1109
01:23:00,417 --> 01:23:01,667
Thank you.

1110
01:23:44,042 --> 01:23:45,375
Kumar...

1111
01:23:48,917 --> 01:23:50,208
call the police.

1112
01:23:54,958 --> 01:23:56,750
I guess they heard I'm on the way.

1113
01:23:56,833 --> 01:23:57,958
Yes, sir.

1114
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,708
But they are looking in
the opposite direction.

1115
01:24:03,583 --> 01:24:06,375
Honk... honk!
Otherwise they won't give way.

1116
01:24:37,125 --> 01:24:39,792
I can't stay here like these idiots.

1117
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:41,458
Let's go back.

1118
01:24:41,542 --> 01:24:42,875
I'll check what's going on.

1119
01:25:11,375 --> 01:25:12,833
Are you alright?

1120
01:25:13,083 --> 01:25:14,208
What are you doing?

1121
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:16,208
Stealing the thunder
from Nayla's party.

1122
01:25:17,208 --> 01:25:18,958
You are unbelievable, Silk.

1123
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,833
Why ruin just one party,
when I can ruin two!

1124
01:25:48,875 --> 01:25:50,792
Driver, start the car... come on!

1125
01:26:02,083 --> 01:26:04,667
There are many stars in
this industry, Silk...

1126
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:08,917
but there's only one hero
- you.

1127
01:26:13,083 --> 01:26:14,500
That was unbelievable.

1128
01:26:17,708 --> 01:26:20,542
You publicly wrecked
her private party.

1129
01:26:20,625 --> 01:26:23,667
Now Nayla will never celebrate
anything, not even her birthday!

1130
01:26:24,583 --> 01:26:27,875
Once Silk decides on something,
she goes through with it.

1131
01:26:27,958 --> 01:26:29,208
Surya, for instance.

1132
01:26:29,375 --> 01:26:32,000
His mouth was open
like an uncovered manhole.

1133
01:26:35,667 --> 01:26:37,250
I hope you didn't mind...

1134
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,083
me kissing you.

1135
01:26:41,875 --> 01:26:44,083
My heart said so and I did.

1136
01:26:44,792 --> 01:26:46,542
Even though the
heart is on the left...

1137
01:26:47,708 --> 01:26:50,333
its decisions are always right.

1138
01:26:52,792 --> 01:26:56,250
Wow, the writer rises...

1139
01:26:56,958 --> 01:26:58,667
You should sleep.

1140
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:02,000
Tomorrow I have
narrate the story to Vijayan.

1141
01:27:02,375 --> 01:27:04,417
And you have a shoot too.

1142
01:27:05,583 --> 01:27:07,750
We just left two
people burning with anger...

1143
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:10,167
and you want to put it out?

1144
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:14,083
If I stay back, a fire
will start over here.

1145
01:27:16,042 --> 01:27:17,333
Then let it.

1146
01:27:25,792 --> 01:27:27,708
Ooh lala, Ooh lala

1147
01:27:27,792 --> 01:27:30,500
You are my...

1148
01:27:31,042 --> 01:27:33,333
You don't call out to
others when you're on the edge.

1149
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:37,875
The bullet exits the gun...

1150
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:39,958
The villain's spirit exits his body...

1151
01:27:40,458 --> 01:27:42,000
The end of the film.

1152
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:43,375
And the audience exits the theater.

1153
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:45,000
What kind of ending is this?

1154
01:27:45,458 --> 01:27:47,250
I didn't even have a fight sequence.

1155
01:27:48,083 --> 01:27:51,000
Swords are pulled
out of their sheath...

1156
01:27:51,083 --> 01:27:53,250
Clothes ripped apart...

1157
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:55,417
Bodies ripped apart... Blood all over.

1158
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,250
That leads to the end of the film.

1159
01:27:57,375 --> 01:28:00,583
You should have a sword fight,
yes a sword fight.

1160
01:28:00,667 --> 01:28:02,833
Sir, the lead hero is a cop.

1161
01:28:03,208 --> 01:28:05,208
How could he have a sword?

1162
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,458
That's a valid point.

1163
01:28:10,333 --> 01:28:11,875
Perhaps an ancestral sword...

1164
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,000
a family heirloom.

1165
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:17,542
But, Sir... the lead
hero is an orphan.

1166
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:18,833
Boring!

1167
01:28:20,167 --> 01:28:22,000
Boring!

1168
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,833
Lead heroes of the 60s
and 70s were orphans.

1169
01:28:27,125 --> 01:28:29,583
We are in the 80s now.

1170
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:33,792
Let him have a family.

1171
01:28:34,583 --> 01:28:35,917
And a sister...

1172
01:28:36,333 --> 01:28:37,583
give her dignity...

1173
01:28:37,667 --> 01:28:38,958
And then take it away!

1174
01:28:39,417 --> 01:28:43,333
His sister's trampled dignity...

1175
01:28:43,958 --> 01:28:47,083
should reflect on his sword.

1176
01:28:47,417 --> 01:28:49,833
Now that will heighten the climax!

1177
01:28:49,917 --> 01:28:51,042
What do you say, Vijayan?

1178
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:53,583
Sir, what an imagination!

1179
01:28:53,667 --> 01:28:55,875
Genius... Sir, you're a genius!

1180
01:28:56,250 --> 01:29:00,458
It's a curse, Vijayan. It's a curse!

1181
01:29:01,417 --> 01:29:03,500
What do you think, Rama?

1182
01:29:04,667 --> 01:29:06,000
I have one word...

1183
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:08,500
Superhit!

1184
01:29:09,542 --> 01:29:12,250
Sir, sensational, this
will be sensational!

1185
01:29:12,708 --> 01:29:15,458
Silk couldn't differentiate
between a man and a horse.

1186
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:19,042
A horse at its peak will win derbies.

1187
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,792
But a man at his peak
moves like time itself.

1188
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:28,000
Then he can neither stop.

1189
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:37,833
Do you remember...
when we first met...

1190
01:29:38,667 --> 01:29:40,375
you couldn't utter a word.

1191
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:43,458
And now you make excuses!

1192
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,667
There was a time when I'd merely
think of you and you would show up.

1193
01:29:53,042 --> 01:29:54,417
And now...

1194
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,208
you think twice before meeting me.

1195
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:57,583
Cut it!

1196
01:29:59,333 --> 01:30:00,583
What are you laughing for?

1197
01:30:00,667 --> 01:30:03,000
You think this is a joke?

1198
01:30:03,083 --> 01:30:04,917
You are the one making a joke, madam.

1199
01:30:05,417 --> 01:30:07,417
We shot this scene yesterday.

1200
01:30:09,625 --> 01:30:11,000
I need a cigarette!

1201
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:12,250
Silk...

1202
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:13,958
what's going on?

1203
01:30:14,542 --> 01:30:16,417
Once upon a time,
you'd act out a scene and..

1204
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,000
..I didn't feel like calling
out ‘cut'.

1205
01:30:18,583 --> 01:30:20,875
But it seems like you
don't feel like acting anymore.

1206
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:22,500
How can I?

1207
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:24,167
There's nothing new to do.

1208
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:27,667
Everyday it's the same old scene,
same old dialogue, same old story.

1209
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:30,583
You can only act in
one particular film...

1210
01:30:30,667 --> 01:30:32,000
and I'll make it.

1211
01:30:34,417 --> 01:30:38,083
I know why you're so arrogant today.

1212
01:30:38,167 --> 01:30:40,958
You've signed on
that new girl, Shakeela.

1213
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,500
But Venkat sir...

1214
01:30:42,917 --> 01:30:44,958
there can never be another Silk.

1215
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,542
And we don't want another Silk!

1216
01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:47,875
Everyday it's something new.

1217
01:30:47,958 --> 01:30:49,500
A new spat with Surya...

1218
01:30:49,583 --> 01:30:51,000
or a new scene with his brother.

1219
01:30:51,083 --> 01:30:52,833
Or your love for the bottle.

1220
01:30:52,958 --> 01:30:54,708
In that case, ‘pack up'!

1221
01:30:59,167 --> 01:31:00,667
Make this film with that...

1222
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:03,542
that girl... Shakeela!

1223
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:05,167
Silk, wait,

1224
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:06,958
don't make a mistake. you'll regret.

1225
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,375
People who walk out on their work...

1226
01:31:09,458 --> 01:31:11,708
spend the rest of their
lives begging for work.

1227
01:31:11,792 --> 01:31:13,125
But they get nothing.

1228
01:31:13,208 --> 01:31:14,417
I am Silk.

1229
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:15,708
Silk.

1230
01:31:15,833 --> 01:31:18,417
Don't forget I'm a star.

1231
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:23,083
When stars fade away, they
become one with the darkness.

1232
01:31:23,167 --> 01:31:25,708
And when the bare darkness strikes...

1233
01:31:25,792 --> 01:31:28,542
the first thing it takes
away is the star's shine.

1234
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,083
Hello...

1235
01:31:45,167 --> 01:31:46,500
Ramakant, please.

1236
01:31:46,875 --> 01:31:48,458
Madam, he is busy at a pooja.
[Religious offering]

1237
01:31:48,542 --> 01:31:49,708
Pooja?

1238
01:31:49,792 --> 01:31:51,250
For what?

1239
01:31:51,708 --> 01:31:54,042
Madam, it's a pooja for his new film.

1240
01:31:54,583 --> 01:31:57,333
Tell Ramakant it's Silk!

1241
01:31:58,708 --> 01:32:00,958
Sorry madam, I can't disturb him.

1242
01:32:13,833 --> 01:32:15,000
Hello...

1243
01:32:15,125 --> 01:32:16,875
Hello, give the phone to Ramakant!

1244
01:32:16,958 --> 01:32:18,083
Madam...

1245
01:32:18,167 --> 01:32:20,417
Tell Ramakant it's Silk!

1246
01:32:23,875 --> 01:32:26,875
It's Silk madam on the line.
She wants to talk to you.

1247
01:32:27,417 --> 01:32:29,083
Tell her I'll call her later.

1248
01:32:29,167 --> 01:32:30,583
Okay.

1249
01:32:33,917 --> 01:32:35,250
I'm sorry, madam.

1250
01:32:35,542 --> 01:32:37,083
I can't disturb him.

1251
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,875
Suryakant sir...

1252
01:32:43,875 --> 01:32:45,292
Sir, I'm very happy.

1253
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:48,583
One brother will write,
the other will act.

1254
01:32:48,667 --> 01:32:49,792
Today is a great day.

1255
01:32:49,875 --> 01:32:51,167
And Silk will dance.

1256
01:32:54,917 --> 01:32:56,167
Excuse me.

1257
01:32:58,167 --> 01:32:59,333
Vijayan!

1258
01:32:59,458 --> 01:33:00,667
Yes, sir?

1259
01:33:03,417 --> 01:33:04,875
Silk...

1260
01:33:05,333 --> 01:33:07,542
will not act in this film.

1261
01:33:08,542 --> 01:33:11,333
The audience has seen
every inch of her talent.

1262
01:33:11,958 --> 01:33:13,417
Sir, as you wish.

1263
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:14,625
But sir...

1264
01:33:14,708 --> 01:33:16,708
the public demands excitement.

1265
01:33:17,417 --> 01:33:20,583
We will change the trend.

1266
01:33:21,458 --> 01:33:23,208
Everything that Silk did...

1267
01:33:23,667 --> 01:33:26,625
we'll get the heroine to do.

1268
01:33:27,167 --> 01:33:28,625
That's fine...

1269
01:33:28,708 --> 01:33:30,250
sir but what about
the heroine's image?

1270
01:33:30,708 --> 01:33:33,250
The public goes for the goods on
display, the store doesn't matter.

1271
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:37,458
when honour is disrobed...

1272
01:33:37,542 --> 01:33:40,750
it's the 'honourable'
ones that enjoy it the most.

1273
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,458
You're right, absolutely right, sir.

1274
01:33:43,958 --> 01:33:46,333
Ramakant, what do you have to say?

1275
01:33:47,125 --> 01:33:48,333
Sir...

1276
01:33:48,417 --> 01:33:49,917
Silk madam on the line.

1277
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,125
Silk...

1278
01:33:53,458 --> 01:33:55,000
what a coincidence.

1279
01:33:56,042 --> 01:33:57,750
We were just talking about you.

1280
01:33:58,417 --> 01:34:00,250
I'm here with Vijayan and Surya.

1281
01:34:01,917 --> 01:34:04,000
They don't want you
for their next film.

1282
01:34:05,292 --> 01:34:07,792
And I think their decision is right.

1283
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,458
You won't do this film.

1284
01:34:10,875 --> 01:34:12,792
Absolutely not!

1285
01:34:13,875 --> 01:34:15,333
On the first day of the shoot...

1286
01:34:16,042 --> 01:34:18,833
I would like to
introduce you to my parents.

1287
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:33,125
Hello, Silk ma'am.

1288
01:34:33,208 --> 01:34:34,667
I am Mutthu.

1289
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:36,875
I am a small time film maker.

1290
01:34:37,542 --> 01:34:39,083
I would to work with you.

1291
01:34:39,167 --> 01:34:41,000
This is my card.

1292
01:34:41,083 --> 01:34:42,500
Drop it at my place.

1293
01:34:42,583 --> 01:34:44,708
Okay, thank you very much.

1294
01:34:45,125 --> 01:34:46,333
Excuse me.

1295
01:34:46,833 --> 01:34:48,542
Well, the set is beautiful.

1296
01:34:49,792 --> 01:34:51,167
Congratulations.

1297
01:34:51,708 --> 01:34:53,625
It's all thanks to you.

1298
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:58,667
And don't make a mess today.

1299
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:01,417
My parents will be here soon.

1300
01:35:02,917 --> 01:35:04,292
Your mother is fine but...

1301
01:35:04,542 --> 01:35:06,208
how old is your father?

1302
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:08,792
Silk, please!

1303
01:35:12,542 --> 01:35:13,958
Relax will you!

1304
01:35:14,875 --> 01:35:17,500
I'm a hit with the men in your family.

1305
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,292
You know... I don't like such jokes.

1306
01:35:23,417 --> 01:35:25,542
Ramakant sir...

1307
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:28,542
One second.

1308
01:35:33,917 --> 01:35:35,208
Silk madam...

1309
01:35:35,833 --> 01:35:38,042
I'm a big fan of yours.

1310
01:35:38,458 --> 01:35:39,667
Thank you.

1311
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:41,625
I am Shakeela.

1312
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:49,042
So you're Shakeela!

1313
01:35:49,125 --> 01:35:51,125
You've heard about me?

1314
01:35:51,708 --> 01:35:55,958
Yes, but it was probably a lie.

1315
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:57,958
Why do you say that?

1316
01:36:01,625 --> 01:36:03,125
Do you have a mirror at home?

1317
01:36:04,292 --> 01:36:05,833
Break it...

1318
01:36:07,208 --> 01:36:10,042
because it's lying that
you can be another Silk.

1319
01:36:13,292 --> 01:36:14,875
You are wrong!

1320
01:36:15,583 --> 01:36:17,833
I'm sure I have something...

1321
01:36:19,125 --> 01:36:22,125
I have the talent.

1322
01:36:25,625 --> 01:36:26,792
Is that so?

1323
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,208
Come on then!

1324
01:37:01,417 --> 01:37:05,083
There is that night of the honeymoon

1325
01:37:05,167 --> 01:37:08,500
I am that night

1326
01:37:08,792 --> 01:37:12,458
The joy of that night

1327
01:37:12,542 --> 01:37:15,000
I am that joy

1328
01:37:15,083 --> 01:37:18,667
That knocks the lover senseless

1329
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:22,042
I am that intoxication

1330
01:37:22,333 --> 01:37:25,958
The mantra to love and
relationships that you have read

1331
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,333
I am that book

1332
01:37:29,708 --> 01:37:33,125
I am that book.

1333
01:37:33,958 --> 01:37:35,667
I play like the banjo

1334
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:37,500
I blossom in dreams

1335
01:37:37,583 --> 01:37:41,083
Gentlemen, make me infamous

1336
01:37:41,167 --> 01:37:43,000
I intoxicate you like whiskey

1337
01:37:43,083 --> 01:37:44,833
I grapple like a hiccup

1338
01:37:44,917 --> 01:37:48,417
Get intoxicated, my gentleman

1339
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:50,542
We forget

1340
01:37:50,625 --> 01:37:52,333
ourselves

1341
01:37:52,458 --> 01:37:55,458
give me a drink like that

1342
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:13,625
Make the room dark

1343
01:38:13,708 --> 01:38:16,917
open your eyes

1344
01:38:17,583 --> 01:38:19,250
Whatever is in your heart

1345
01:38:19,333 --> 01:38:23,708
whisper it in my
ears through some crowds

1346
01:38:24,833 --> 01:38:28,333
Don't worry about the danger

1347
01:38:28,458 --> 01:38:31,792
Surpass all the limits

1348
01:38:31,875 --> 01:38:33,667
Come forth

1349
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:35,583
don't struggle with me

1350
01:38:35,667 --> 01:38:38,500
leave everything to me

1351
01:38:39,125 --> 01:38:42,542
Bad

1352
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
half...sullen...departed

1353
01:38:45,083 --> 01:38:46,625
broken, is your dream

1354
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:49,750
without me

1355
01:38:54,583 --> 01:38:56,583
It is only me

1356
01:38:56,667 --> 01:38:58,250
I am that intoxication

1357
01:38:58,333 --> 01:39:01,875
Blend us together

1358
01:39:15,583 --> 01:39:16,917
Let her go!

1359
01:39:18,292 --> 01:39:19,958
She isn't worthy of you.

1360
01:39:22,208 --> 01:39:24,208
Women like Silk
don't belong at home...

1361
01:39:24,292 --> 01:39:26,625
a bed is where they belong.

1362
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,667
What have you done, Silk?

1363
01:39:30,292 --> 01:39:32,625
I had told you... don't think.

1364
01:39:33,458 --> 01:39:35,167
You gave up too soon.

1365
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:45,125
Say what you want to!

1366
01:39:47,125 --> 01:39:49,750
Couldn't you control
yourself for just one night?

1367
01:39:49,833 --> 01:39:51,500
What difference would that make?

1368
01:39:51,583 --> 01:39:53,917
Would your parents
think I'm a decent girl?

1369
01:39:54,208 --> 01:39:56,333
What is their impression now?

1370
01:39:57,250 --> 01:40:00,542
They think you are
lewd and disgusting.

1371
01:40:00,667 --> 01:40:03,333
Well, you're in love
with someone like her.

1372
01:40:03,875 --> 01:40:06,250
That's my character on screen.
I'm not like that in real life.

1373
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,500
You mean you'll stay
like this all your life?

1374
01:40:09,583 --> 01:40:11,250
Lewd and disgusting?

1375
01:40:11,708 --> 01:40:14,042
The thing that made me Silk...

1376
01:40:14,583 --> 01:40:16,000
how can I let it go?

1377
01:40:18,333 --> 01:40:20,042
Surya was right...

1378
01:40:20,625 --> 01:40:23,458
women like Silk
don't belong at home...

1379
01:40:27,667 --> 01:40:30,250
Of course, a bed is
where they belong isn't it!

1380
01:40:40,792 --> 01:40:44,792
Silk's noose is ready for both of you.

1381
01:40:51,083 --> 01:40:53,542
You call me lewd and disgusting...

1382
01:40:54,417 --> 01:40:57,000
see how I ruin you!

1383
01:43:11,667 --> 01:43:14,125
What you're
proposing is a very big risk.

1384
01:43:15,167 --> 01:43:16,417
Think about it.

1385
01:43:17,958 --> 01:43:20,333
When God has blessed
you with one life...

1386
01:43:20,708 --> 01:43:22,417
why think twice?

1387
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,125
No, think again.

1388
01:43:24,208 --> 01:43:26,792
You could lose all
that you have earned.

1389
01:43:28,083 --> 01:43:30,792
I never thought I'd
get what I have earned.

1390
01:43:30,875 --> 01:43:33,542
You need to do a lot of
films to earn that much.

1391
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:37,208
But only one is enough to lose it all.

1392
01:43:37,875 --> 01:43:39,000
It's your blood and sweat...

1393
01:43:39,083 --> 01:43:40,333
that's why I'm telling you.

1394
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:42,167
I've seen you rise up...

1395
01:43:43,417 --> 01:43:45,083
I can't bear to see you fall.

1396
01:43:47,042 --> 01:43:50,292
Silk trusts her Mr. Worm.

1397
01:43:53,917 --> 01:43:57,125
I love your idea of a triple role!

1398
01:43:57,333 --> 01:43:59,125
One mother and two daughters.

1399
01:43:59,667 --> 01:44:01,333
That's what I thought.

1400
01:44:01,917 --> 01:44:05,667
When people see one Silk,
their tongues hit the floor.

1401
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,625
When they see three Silks together...

1402
01:44:08,708 --> 01:44:10,250
their trousers will hit the floor!

1403
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,333
Remember Abraham?

1404
01:44:15,958 --> 01:44:17,500
What about him? Is he dead?

1405
01:44:17,583 --> 01:44:19,292
He is alive.

1406
01:44:19,958 --> 01:44:22,625
He is also making a triple role film.

1407
01:44:22,708 --> 01:44:24,333
And he is playing the lead.

1408
01:44:24,875 --> 01:44:26,292
Ramakant is writing the script.

1409
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,417
Mr. Worm...

1410
01:44:30,083 --> 01:44:32,458
do you know why Silk is so expensive?

1411
01:44:34,833 --> 01:44:37,583
Because it is meant to shine.

1412
01:44:38,583 --> 01:44:40,208
Let him make his film.

1413
01:44:40,583 --> 01:44:42,625
We will watch it and
so will the public.

1414
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:48,000
The era of hate was over.

1415
01:44:48,833 --> 01:44:51,000
Now it was time to
destroy Silk, once and for all.

1416
01:44:51,333 --> 01:44:54,583
She stole my idea to
compete against me!

1417
01:44:54,667 --> 01:44:56,083
I will put an end to her!

1418
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:23,417
Hello, Mr. Worm...

1419
01:45:24,292 --> 01:45:25,750
Good good!

1420
01:45:25,917 --> 01:45:28,875
Mr. Worm, will the
trousers come down or not?

1421
01:45:29,083 --> 01:45:32,083
Everything will come down.

1422
01:46:02,708 --> 01:46:03,958
Your cheque.

1423
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,208
Thanks.

1424
01:48:00,708 --> 01:48:03,417
You stepped on the beach
and the tide subsided.

1425
01:48:05,417 --> 01:48:07,417
When the tide rises...

1426
01:48:07,833 --> 01:48:10,208
you will be the first to drown.

1427
01:48:10,583 --> 01:48:12,750
I even swam through the
giant waves in a storm...

1428
01:48:13,583 --> 01:48:15,083
and that's the reason I've survived.

1429
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,083
But you...

1430
01:48:19,167 --> 01:48:22,042
you're back to where you started from.

1431
01:48:22,292 --> 01:48:24,208
Well, even you've come to me.

1432
01:48:25,208 --> 01:48:26,958
You can't live without me.

1433
01:48:27,833 --> 01:48:29,625
My biggest fan.

1434
01:48:35,542 --> 01:48:37,583
I'm here to celebrate your defeat.

1435
01:48:37,875 --> 01:48:39,000
Why?

1436
01:48:39,083 --> 01:48:41,792
Don't have anyone to
celebrate your success with?

1437
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:49,625
I had told you...

1438
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,542
you can't defeat me.

1439
01:48:53,333 --> 01:48:55,042
But the fight was a pleasure.

1440
01:48:55,583 --> 01:48:57,958
Silk is born to give pleasure.

1441
01:48:58,458 --> 01:49:01,792
To her well-wishers and her opponents.

1442
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:07,208
And you are extra special.

1443
01:49:11,083 --> 01:49:12,958
That's what the newspapers say.

1444
01:49:15,333 --> 01:49:18,458
But there's something you
still haven't revealed...

1445
01:49:19,667 --> 01:49:21,667
the fact that you like me.

1446
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,583
Flop actress.

1447
01:49:28,667 --> 01:49:30,958
She had the last
word like the lead hero.

1448
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,125
I like her?

1449
01:49:36,625 --> 01:49:39,000
If she were the last woman on earth...

1450
01:49:39,083 --> 01:49:40,708
I'd castrate myself!

1451
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,208
Murli...

1452
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:55,125
Murli...

1453
01:49:56,042 --> 01:49:57,583
a large coffee, please.

1454
01:49:57,917 --> 01:49:59,250
And for the two women?

1455
01:49:59,333 --> 01:50:00,500
Beer or tequila?

1456
01:50:00,583 --> 01:50:03,000
Success does bestow a
certain energy, Murli.

1457
01:50:03,708 --> 01:50:05,042
Two girls?

1458
01:50:05,125 --> 01:50:06,750
It's not what you think.

1459
01:50:06,833 --> 01:50:08,500
One brought you home last night.

1460
01:50:08,583 --> 01:50:11,250
And the other is waiting
outside with her camera.

1461
01:50:12,125 --> 01:50:13,708
Ask the one with the camera to wait...

1462
01:50:14,083 --> 01:50:15,542
and send the one
from last night packing!

1463
01:50:16,042 --> 01:50:17,417
I'm leaving!

1464
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:21,167
Last night was great, wasn't it?

1465
01:50:21,250 --> 01:50:22,458
No way!

1466
01:50:22,583 --> 01:50:25,250
And you should be with Silk, not me!

1467
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,417
All night you kept talking
about that disgusting woman!

1468
01:50:30,333 --> 01:50:31,917
Oh, I'm sorry baby.

1469
01:50:33,167 --> 01:50:34,583
Tell me something...

1470
01:50:35,917 --> 01:50:37,667
when I was talking about her...

1471
01:50:38,417 --> 01:50:40,000
was it with hatred or affection?

1472
01:50:40,333 --> 01:50:41,750
What?

1473
01:50:42,542 --> 01:50:45,917
The problem is I... I hate her...

1474
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:49,042
but she thinks I love her.

1475
01:50:50,292 --> 01:50:53,000
I want to know what my
feelings have to say.

1476
01:50:53,208 --> 01:50:54,500
You are mad...

1477
01:50:54,833 --> 01:50:56,458
absolutely mad!

1478
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,292
Bye... I will call you.

1479
01:50:59,333 --> 01:51:00,542
Yeah, sure!

1480
01:51:00,833 --> 01:51:02,500
You don't even know my name!

1481
01:51:04,250 --> 01:51:06,958
Yet you spent the night with me and...

1482
01:51:07,417 --> 01:51:08,917
are calling Silk disgusting!

1483
01:51:19,542 --> 01:51:22,208
How did I end up in this
Shakespearean tragedy, Silk?

1484
01:51:23,583 --> 01:51:26,167
Earlier I fought with you
and now I'm fighting for you!

1485
01:51:32,958 --> 01:51:35,583
Your girlfriend left
hurling abuses at you.

1486
01:51:37,083 --> 01:51:38,250
She was nothing.

1487
01:51:38,917 --> 01:51:41,000
Last week a girl almost broke my head!

1488
01:51:41,792 --> 01:51:43,250
Back then you were nothing...

1489
01:51:43,708 --> 01:51:45,000
now you are.

1490
01:51:45,958 --> 01:51:47,583
Next week again I'll be nothing.

1491
01:51:47,792 --> 01:51:49,833
I'm not some film
that changes every week.

1492
01:51:51,083 --> 01:51:54,292
You just reminded me of someone.

1493
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:56,792
I imagined I was the only
antique piece around here.

1494
01:51:58,417 --> 01:52:00,208
Hey, by the way, congrats.

1495
01:52:00,292 --> 01:52:02,000
You've defeated Silk.

1496
01:52:02,875 --> 01:52:04,292
I can't believe you guys!

1497
01:52:05,333 --> 01:52:07,125
I get no credit for my success.

1498
01:52:07,667 --> 01:52:10,000
You're congratulating
me because Silk failed.

1499
01:52:10,083 --> 01:52:11,417
Abraham...

1500
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,042
whose corner are you in?

1501
01:52:13,583 --> 01:52:16,292
Our corner or Silk's corner?

1502
01:52:16,792 --> 01:52:18,000
I hate her.

1503
01:52:18,917 --> 01:52:20,875
And if you want to
continue talking about her...

1504
01:52:21,333 --> 01:52:22,708
then this interview is over!

1505
01:52:22,792 --> 01:52:23,917
I didn't know that...

1506
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,417
Silk is such a sensitive topic.

1507
01:52:26,792 --> 01:52:28,083
Tell me something...

1508
01:52:28,167 --> 01:52:31,167
what brought about this
drastic change in your films?

1509
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:36,458
You see... one day I was watching
my own film and I fell asleep.

1510
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,042
That's when I realised something.

1511
01:52:41,208 --> 01:52:43,833
Films need three things to sell...

1512
01:52:45,250 --> 01:52:49,083
entertainment,
entertainment, entertainment!

1513
01:53:14,958 --> 01:53:17,125
Silk... anything important?

1514
01:53:17,958 --> 01:53:19,708
I have come here to get high.

1515
01:53:21,083 --> 01:53:23,750
You know acting always gets me high.

1516
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,375
Silk, you know very well that...

1517
01:53:26,667 --> 01:53:29,500
neither I nor anybody
else will give you any work.

1518
01:53:31,417 --> 01:53:33,792
But if you want some money...

1519
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,375
Do you have five rupees?

1520
01:53:38,167 --> 01:53:39,417
Five rupees?

1521
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,458
When I first tried to get
into films, someone told me...

1522
01:53:43,583 --> 01:53:45,708
that nobody would give me any work.

1523
01:53:46,125 --> 01:53:48,083
He gave me five
rupees and sent me away.

1524
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,875
Sir, give me five rupees.

1525
01:53:51,167 --> 01:53:53,125
Probably those days will come back.

1526
01:54:04,875 --> 01:54:06,000
I was the dog that...

1527
01:54:06,083 --> 01:54:09,333
had gone mad after biting Silk.

1528
01:54:10,875 --> 01:54:13,167
I never let a friend
get close to me...

1529
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:16,292
but Silk was, all
thanks to our enmity.

1530
01:54:16,708 --> 01:54:18,250
Why did I go to her?

1531
01:54:18,333 --> 01:54:19,625
For company?

1532
01:54:20,208 --> 01:54:22,875
For lack of a friend,
an enemy would do.

1533
01:54:34,708 --> 01:54:36,167
Don't stare at me.

1534
01:54:36,708 --> 01:54:39,792
It's as if the oven is
awaiting a marinated chicken!

1535
01:54:41,042 --> 01:54:43,750
At least try to give
yourself some respect in your words.

1536
01:54:45,250 --> 01:54:47,125
Anyway, what are you doing here?

1537
01:54:47,708 --> 01:54:49,750
For lack of a friend,
an enemy will do.

1538
01:54:52,708 --> 01:54:54,500
I've destroyed you...

1539
01:54:55,750 --> 01:55:00,083
I was here to see how
many stitches Silk needs.

1540
01:55:03,333 --> 01:55:05,125
Have a coffee... I'll pay for it.

1541
01:55:07,708 --> 01:55:09,375
Two Silk coffees, please.

1542
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:15,708
The coffee that goes by
my name is quite famous.

1543
01:55:16,417 --> 01:55:17,542
Try it.

1544
01:55:17,625 --> 01:55:19,375
It's the best cure for a hangover.

1545
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:22,875
You will burn in hell!

1546
01:55:23,042 --> 01:55:24,250
And you...

1547
01:55:25,667 --> 01:55:28,750
you will enjoy it as a
bonfire and warm your hands.

1548
01:55:49,958 --> 01:55:52,375
My heart and mind
were caught in a duel.

1549
01:55:52,917 --> 01:55:56,375
I guess I was too high
that I began to like Silk.

1550
01:55:56,792 --> 01:55:58,000
The mind warned...

1551
01:55:58,083 --> 01:56:00,333
‘Don't be an idiot, control yourself.'

1552
01:56:00,667 --> 01:56:03,000
For every man there is a woman.

1553
01:56:03,083 --> 01:56:05,708
If you can stay away from her,
life will be great.

1554
01:56:06,042 --> 01:56:07,292
Otherwise it's over.

1555
01:56:23,417 --> 01:56:24,542
I viewed from different angles...

1556
01:56:24,625 --> 01:56:26,167
in different poses...

1557
01:56:26,458 --> 01:56:27,875
even stood on my head...

1558
01:56:28,667 --> 01:56:30,000
but same results.

1559
01:56:31,667 --> 01:56:33,125
I can never like you.

1560
01:56:35,458 --> 01:56:37,083
You better get yourself checked...

1561
01:56:38,042 --> 01:56:40,875
or you won't like your wife
the day after your wedding.

1562
01:56:47,042 --> 01:56:48,333
Do you have any alcohol?

1563
01:56:50,083 --> 01:56:52,083
Do I look like an idiot?

1564
01:56:52,625 --> 01:56:55,667
That I offer you a
drink and let you abuse me?

1565
01:56:58,458 --> 01:57:00,500
I want a drink because
I don't want to abuse.

1566
01:57:01,958 --> 01:57:03,542
I think you're the type of girl...

1567
01:57:03,625 --> 01:57:05,625
who looks better after a drink.

1568
01:57:16,375 --> 01:57:18,042
This is the worst!

1569
01:57:18,792 --> 01:57:21,417
You mean it struck a
chord in your heart.

1570
01:57:23,542 --> 01:57:25,583
The colour of the bathtub is awful...

1571
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,417
there should've been more bubbles...

1572
01:57:28,042 --> 01:57:29,292
I didn't like it.

1573
01:57:29,375 --> 01:57:30,708
Then give it back.

1574
01:57:31,458 --> 01:57:32,792
I'm keeping it.

1575
01:57:35,917 --> 01:57:37,167
What about this?

1576
01:57:42,125 --> 01:57:43,958
Even children wear
more clothes than you.

1577
01:57:58,917 --> 01:58:02,042
If you manage to live
up to a ripe old age...

1578
01:58:02,542 --> 01:58:04,708
you will look
exactly like your mother.

1579
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,333
That's not my mother...

1580
01:58:07,417 --> 01:58:08,708
it's me!

1581
01:58:10,042 --> 01:58:12,500
Nayla wanted to interview my mother.

1582
01:58:12,792 --> 01:58:14,792
You know Nayla...

1583
01:58:14,917 --> 01:58:17,083
she can be very persistent.

1584
01:58:18,125 --> 01:58:20,000
It was not easy to say 'no' to her...

1585
01:58:20,083 --> 01:58:21,917
but it was easy to
become my own mother.

1586
01:58:22,458 --> 01:58:25,292
So... I dusted my hair with powder,
wore a dull saree...

1587
01:58:25,375 --> 01:58:27,042
and gave the interview.

1588
01:58:28,792 --> 01:58:30,625
Have you done anything straight?

1589
01:58:32,208 --> 01:58:34,000
Why didn't you take
Nayla to your mother?

1590
01:58:36,667 --> 01:58:39,000
My mother had slammed the door on me.

1591
01:58:40,458 --> 01:58:42,083
Why would they talk about me...

1592
01:58:42,167 --> 01:58:44,250
when they are
embarrassed they gave birth to me.

1593
01:58:48,792 --> 01:58:51,208
If you weren't born at all,
how would the world ever know...

1594
01:58:51,292 --> 01:58:53,333
that women can also be like you!

1595
01:58:56,333 --> 01:58:57,583
Is that an abuse
disguised as praise...

1596
01:58:57,667 --> 01:58:59,667
or praise concealed in an abuse?

1597
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,125
I can't praise you...

1598
01:59:06,042 --> 01:59:08,500
and lately I can't even abuse you.

1599
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,042
Be careful, Abraham.

1600
01:59:13,250 --> 01:59:16,042
I guess... you're starting to like me.

1601
01:59:19,208 --> 01:59:21,208
I told you, you're the type of girl...

1602
01:59:21,292 --> 01:59:23,167
who looks better after a drink.

1603
01:59:28,708 --> 01:59:30,500
Have you ever been in love?

1604
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:35,208
Love that leads you to bed...

1605
01:59:35,583 --> 01:59:36,875
yes.

1606
01:59:38,250 --> 01:59:40,042
Love that takes away your breath...

1607
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:41,958
no.

1608
01:59:48,625 --> 01:59:50,292
How many people have touched you?

1609
01:59:55,667 --> 01:59:57,625
Many have touched me...

1610
01:59:59,208 --> 02:00:01,167
but nobody has ever touched my heart.

1611
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,292
This is what happens when...

1612
02:00:06,625 --> 02:00:08,667
a boy and a girl meet,
they get close...

1613
02:00:09,042 --> 02:00:10,667
they kiss... end of story.

1614
02:00:13,875 --> 02:00:15,958
I've gained infamy because of that.

1615
02:00:22,125 --> 02:00:24,625
But if this story ends
here like this, it will be...

1616
02:00:25,292 --> 02:00:26,583
Be what?

1617
02:00:30,417 --> 02:00:32,042
It'll be a sin.

1618
02:01:12,542 --> 02:01:15,292
Love is a song of the Gods

1619
02:01:15,375 --> 02:01:18,083
Love is a festival of
lights for the heart

1620
02:01:18,167 --> 02:01:20,917
Love is a fragrance

1621
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,708
Love is a burst of morning hues

1622
02:01:23,792 --> 02:01:26,458
Love is a lilting waterfall

1623
02:01:26,542 --> 02:01:29,208
Love is a prayer

1624
02:01:29,292 --> 02:01:32,042
Love exists in every breath

1625
02:01:32,125 --> 02:01:34,750
Love lays in the eyes

1626
02:01:34,875 --> 02:01:40,125
Separate my heart from my soul

1627
02:01:40,417 --> 02:01:45,583
destroy me in love

1628
02:01:46,042 --> 02:01:48,875
make my existence

1629
02:01:48,958 --> 02:01:51,583
complete with love

1630
02:01:51,667 --> 02:01:54,042
To you

1631
02:01:54,167 --> 02:01:57,000
I surrender all my love.

1632
02:01:57,083 --> 02:01:59,625
My love is an absolute submission.

1633
02:01:59,708 --> 02:02:02,708
My love is an absolute submission.

1634
02:02:02,792 --> 02:02:05,208
To you

1635
02:02:05,292 --> 02:02:08,000
I surrender all my love.

1636
02:02:08,083 --> 02:02:10,750
My love is an absolute submission.

1637
02:02:10,917 --> 02:02:13,875
My love is an absolute submission.

1638
02:02:13,958 --> 02:02:16,708
Love is a song of the Gods

1639
02:02:16,792 --> 02:02:19,500
Love is a festival of
lights for the heart

1640
02:02:19,583 --> 02:02:22,208
Love is a fragrance

1641
02:02:22,333 --> 02:02:24,792
Love is a burst of morning hues

1642
02:02:39,750 --> 02:02:44,417
I think of you in the morning

1643
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:50,042
I think of you at dawn

1644
02:02:56,583 --> 02:03:01,292
My destiny

1645
02:03:02,167 --> 02:03:06,542
holds only your name

1646
02:03:07,792 --> 02:03:10,583
In your fire I burn

1647
02:03:10,667 --> 02:03:13,417
playing with the coal

1648
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:15,667
In my dreams, I walk ahead

1649
02:03:15,750 --> 02:03:18,083
to tell you...

1650
02:03:18,167 --> 02:03:20,583
To you

1651
02:03:20,708 --> 02:03:23,292
I surrender all my love

1652
02:03:23,375 --> 02:03:26,125
My love is an absolute submission

1653
02:03:26,208 --> 02:03:29,167
My love is an absolute submission

1654
02:03:29,250 --> 02:03:31,708
To you

1655
02:03:31,792 --> 02:03:34,625
I surrender all my love

1656
02:03:34,708 --> 02:03:37,250
My love is an absolute submission.

1657
02:03:37,375 --> 02:03:41,083
My love is an absolute submission.

1658
02:03:59,208 --> 02:04:02,083
Walking together

1659
02:04:02,167 --> 02:04:04,750
our hands leave each others' grasp

1660
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:10,042
Don't meet me in such paths

1661
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:13,292
Talking

1662
02:04:13,375 --> 02:04:16,042
the night fades away

1663
02:04:16,125 --> 02:04:20,875
Meet me in those nights

1664
02:04:20,958 --> 02:04:22,250
Who am 1?

1665
02:04:22,333 --> 02:04:23,667
Who is God?

1666
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:25,083
Where you are

1667
02:04:25,167 --> 02:04:26,458
I find everything

1668
02:04:26,542 --> 02:04:27,875
Our lips meet

1669
02:04:27,958 --> 02:04:29,208
my lips blossom

1670
02:04:29,292 --> 02:04:32,042
Why should I move away?

1671
02:04:32,125 --> 02:04:34,458
To you

1672
02:04:34,583 --> 02:04:37,333
I surrender all my love.

1673
02:04:37,417 --> 02:04:40,083
My love is an absolute submission.

1674
02:04:40,167 --> 02:04:43,083
My love is an absolute submission.

1675
02:04:43,167 --> 02:04:45,625
To you

1676
02:04:45,708 --> 02:04:48,500
I surrender all my love.

1677
02:04:48,583 --> 02:04:51,250
My love is an absolute submission.

1678
02:04:51,333 --> 02:04:55,208
My love is an absolute submission.

1679
02:05:10,667 --> 02:05:15,333
I'm sober, and yet
you're still beautiful.

1680
02:05:56,042 --> 02:05:59,208
Nothing else could be
worse than this, Silk.

1681
02:06:00,417 --> 02:06:02,917
Even your enemy
doesn't hate you anymore.

1682
02:06:12,125 --> 02:06:13,292
Hello?

1683
02:06:13,375 --> 02:06:14,500
Silk.

1684
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,500
Who is it?

1685
02:06:16,708 --> 02:06:17,917
Who is there?

1686
02:06:18,792 --> 02:06:20,000
Who is it you want?

1687
02:06:20,083 --> 02:06:22,458
Ask, ‘what do you want?'

1688
02:06:22,542 --> 02:06:24,167
My money. All of it!

1689
02:06:25,208 --> 02:06:26,875
I told you I will give it back...

1690
02:06:26,958 --> 02:06:28,292
I'm not going anywhere.

1691
02:06:28,375 --> 02:06:29,792
You have my house as collateral.

1692
02:06:29,917 --> 02:06:31,125
Listen, madam!

1693
02:06:31,250 --> 02:06:34,458
As soon as I sign my next film,
I will return everything.

1694
02:06:34,750 --> 02:06:37,750
I saw your last film
and the empty theatres.

1695
02:06:38,042 --> 02:06:39,708
You think anybody
will offer you a film?

1696
02:06:39,958 --> 02:06:42,083
You have until next week...

1697
02:06:42,167 --> 02:06:43,625
or you can forget the house.

1698
02:07:04,333 --> 02:07:08,083
I had no idea that Silk
was so badly shattered.

1699
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:11,167
She herself didn't
know what was she up to.

1700
02:07:19,792 --> 02:07:21,167
Oh great, you are here.

1701
02:07:21,250 --> 02:07:22,417
Come...

1702
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:23,708
I've been waiting for you.

1703
02:07:23,792 --> 02:07:24,917
Come in...

1704
02:07:26,250 --> 02:07:28,500
Everything is ready for you.

1705
02:07:28,625 --> 02:07:29,500
Everything.

1706
02:07:29,625 --> 02:07:30,500
What do you mean ready?

1707
02:07:30,583 --> 02:07:31,542
What's the story?

1708
02:07:31,667 --> 02:07:32,958
Script... dialogues?

1709
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,125
Story... sexy.

1710
02:07:36,375 --> 02:07:38,042
Dialogue... sexy.

1711
02:07:38,667 --> 02:07:41,042
Expression... sexy.

1712
02:07:42,167 --> 02:07:49,083
Madam, from your head to your toe,
you should only exude sex.

1713
02:07:52,875 --> 02:07:54,708
- What are you thinking about?
-l don't... I don't get it...

1714
02:07:55,375 --> 02:07:56,917
what's going on?

1715
02:07:57,083 --> 02:07:58,458
Don't worry.

1716
02:07:58,542 --> 02:08:00,000
I don't think I can do it.

1717
02:08:00,083 --> 02:08:01,708
Listen to me, please.

1718
02:08:02,250 --> 02:08:03,667
Don't be scared of them.

1719
02:08:03,917 --> 02:08:05,375
They are all junior artists.

1720
02:08:05,458 --> 02:08:07,000
But you are different.

1721
02:08:07,375 --> 02:08:08,417
They are rehearsing.

1722
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:10,042
Come with me.

1723
02:08:10,125 --> 02:08:11,500
Have a seat.

1724
02:08:11,583 --> 02:08:13,375
I'll explain it to you.

1725
02:08:13,458 --> 02:08:17,125
We will do exactly as you say.

1726
02:08:17,208 --> 02:08:18,917
Don't worry at all.

1727
02:08:20,250 --> 02:08:21,500
Just a minute.

1728
02:08:22,292 --> 02:08:23,583
Listen madam...

1729
02:08:23,667 --> 02:08:25,583
right now I have a film...

1730
02:08:25,958 --> 02:08:27,667
and money.

1731
02:08:27,750 --> 02:08:30,333
It's yours, keep it.

1732
02:08:32,125 --> 02:08:36,083
Madam, right now you
don't have either of them.

1733
02:08:37,458 --> 02:08:39,125
What are you worried about?

1734
02:08:39,208 --> 02:08:40,417
Do it.

1735
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:42,000
Trust me, just do it.

1736
02:08:42,083 --> 02:08:44,708
I suggest you have a drink.

1737
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,458
Relax... then think about it.

1738
02:08:47,542 --> 02:08:48,750
No problem at all.

1739
02:08:48,875 --> 02:08:50,292
Drink!

1740
02:08:51,875 --> 02:08:53,125
Madam...

1741
02:08:53,208 --> 02:08:58,708
you make one film with me and I
will plant a garden of money for you.

1742
02:08:59,042 --> 02:09:03,000
And then, both money
and films will chase you!

1743
02:09:08,042 --> 02:09:09,458
Here take this...

1744
02:09:09,583 --> 02:09:11,417
don't think, just take it. Come on!

1745
02:09:22,458 --> 02:09:23,750
Good.

1746
02:09:48,417 --> 02:09:51,083
Madam, we're ready for your shot.

1747
02:09:51,167 --> 02:09:52,750
Come!

1748
02:09:55,042 --> 02:09:56,417
Good. Good Silk.

1749
02:09:56,542 --> 02:09:58,167
Make it sexy.

1750
02:10:22,542 --> 02:10:24,792
Police police...

1751
02:10:52,917 --> 02:10:54,375
You are Silk, right?

1752
02:10:55,333 --> 02:10:57,208
Hey, madam.

1753
02:13:30,042 --> 02:13:31,417
Why don't you freshen up...

1754
02:13:31,792 --> 02:13:35,083
If you need anything,
he will help you.

1755
02:13:35,583 --> 02:13:36,792
This way, madam.

1756
02:13:37,417 --> 02:13:38,583
Please.

1757
02:13:56,500 --> 02:13:57,917
Come on, Silk... pick up.

1758
02:14:01,875 --> 02:14:04,042
I have such a big
surprise for you... answer!

1759
02:14:29,083 --> 02:14:31,042
I haven't been able to talk to Silk.

1760
02:14:31,292 --> 02:14:32,542
I guess she's not at home.

1761
02:14:32,625 --> 02:14:34,083
Okay.

1762
02:14:34,167 --> 02:14:36,083
There's something I
need to do right now...

1763
02:14:36,167 --> 02:14:37,667
so, tomorrow I'll take you there.

1764
02:14:38,292 --> 02:14:39,417
Alright.

1765
02:14:39,667 --> 02:14:41,042
Okay.

1766
02:14:43,792 --> 02:14:47,500
‘Congrats! What a film!
Brilliant acting!"

1767
02:14:48,042 --> 02:14:49,750
Everybody had words of praise.

1768
02:14:50,083 --> 02:14:52,375
The buttons of my shirt gave way...

1769
02:14:52,458 --> 02:14:54,792
my chest was so puffed up with pride!

1770
02:14:55,875 --> 02:14:57,750
Then what was I missing?

1771
02:14:58,250 --> 02:14:59,542
I was at the party...

1772
02:15:00,458 --> 02:15:02,042
but my thoughts were elsewhere...

1773
02:15:02,667 --> 02:15:04,042
Silk...

1774
02:15:04,458 --> 02:15:06,375
Silk... Silk... Silk...

1775
02:15:07,208 --> 02:15:09,875
Her name kept ringing in my mind.

1776
02:15:10,333 --> 02:15:11,625
But she...

1777
02:15:12,167 --> 02:15:13,750
she wasn't even answering her phone!

1778
02:15:26,875 --> 02:15:28,958
Hello?
- There's something strange about you.

1779
02:15:29,500 --> 02:15:31,958
When I ignored you, I
bumped into you everywhere.

1780
02:15:32,125 --> 02:15:33,792
Now when I want to see you...

1781
02:15:34,208 --> 02:15:35,875
you decide to vanish.

1782
02:15:37,417 --> 02:15:39,875
Abraham, do yourself a favour.

1783
02:15:39,958 --> 02:15:41,875
Find yourself someone nice.

1784
02:15:42,208 --> 02:15:43,458
Listen...

1785
02:15:44,708 --> 02:15:46,500
I have a big surprise for you.

1786
02:15:47,042 --> 02:15:49,250
You want to sign me for your film?

1787
02:15:50,542 --> 02:15:51,958
Even better.

1788
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:53,667
I'm waiting.

1789
02:15:53,875 --> 02:15:55,083
Right now...

1790
02:15:55,167 --> 02:15:59,125
I'm stuck at a boring
party with boring people.

1791
02:15:59,208 --> 02:16:00,542
Who is there?

1792
02:16:00,625 --> 02:16:02,000
The usual suspects.

1793
02:16:02,083 --> 02:16:05,958
Suryakant, Ramakant,
Venkat, Vijayan, Selva Ganesh...

1794
02:16:07,708 --> 02:16:10,208
Tell them I've said ‘bye'.

1795
02:16:12,042 --> 02:16:13,292
Where are you going?

1796
02:16:14,958 --> 02:16:16,333
To bed.

1797
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:19,625
I'm very sleepy.

1798
02:16:19,708 --> 02:16:21,208
See you in the morning.

1799
02:16:21,542 --> 02:16:23,542
Promise. I'll see you.

1800
02:16:34,792 --> 02:16:36,667
Abraham sir...

1801
02:16:36,750 --> 02:16:37,917
it's your party.

1802
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:39,083
We were looking for you.

1803
02:16:39,167 --> 02:16:40,167
You just vanished.

1804
02:16:40,250 --> 02:16:41,417
Where were you?

1805
02:16:42,083 --> 02:16:43,292
I was talking to Silk.

1806
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,875
The bus isn't moving, then
why are you running after it?

1807
02:16:49,542 --> 02:16:51,083
She's worthless.

1808
02:16:51,708 --> 02:16:53,000
You can talk to her anytime.

1809
02:16:53,083 --> 02:16:54,542
Enjoy the party.

1810
02:16:54,917 --> 02:16:57,000
What did she have to say?

1811
02:16:58,667 --> 02:17:00,167
She said bye to all of you.

1812
02:17:00,625 --> 02:17:01,792
Is she going somewhere?

1813
02:17:01,917 --> 02:17:03,875
It's the right thing to do, Ramakant.

1814
02:17:04,625 --> 02:17:06,458
She should go away.

1815
02:17:07,792 --> 02:17:10,333
There's nothing left for her anymore.

1816
02:18:42,958 --> 02:18:44,125
Silk!

1817
02:18:49,625 --> 02:18:50,958
Silk!

1818
02:19:16,042 --> 02:19:17,208
Silk!

1819
02:19:17,792 --> 02:19:20,000
Silk!

1820
02:19:55,542 --> 02:19:59,333
When life becomes miserable,
that's when you begin to understand it.

1821
02:20:00,375 --> 02:20:05,292
And a million questions arise to
which you will never get the answers.

1822
02:20:06,542 --> 02:20:09,708
Why didn't mother hug me as
soon as she opened the door?

1823
02:20:10,875 --> 02:20:12,708
Why didn't I realise that...

1824
02:20:12,792 --> 02:20:17,125
worshipping a star and loving a
star are two different things.

1825
02:20:18,792 --> 02:20:21,083
The person whom you taught
to stand up for himself...

1826
02:20:21,167 --> 02:20:23,042
why didn't he stand up for you?

1827
02:20:24,333 --> 02:20:29,958
Everybody wanted to feel me,
why didn't anybody hold my hand?

1828
02:20:32,250 --> 02:20:35,542
You can hear the
pages turn in a library.

1829
02:20:36,417 --> 02:20:39,875
You can even hear
honking in a 'silence' zone.

1830
02:20:40,458 --> 02:20:44,417
But when ears that are accustomed to
applause fail to hear the abuses...

1831
02:20:44,917 --> 02:20:48,583
life begins to
resemble an empty theatre.

1832
02:20:55,625 --> 02:20:58,958
I don't know whether
Silk was right or wrong?

1833
02:20:59,833 --> 02:21:02,667
The matters in a person's
life runs for really long.

1834
02:21:03,958 --> 02:21:06,542
But the judgments are passed up there.

1835
02:21:07,708 --> 02:21:09,000
Up there.

1836
02:21:11,667 --> 02:21:14,458
Silk must be creating an
uproar up there as well.

1837
02:22:05,792 --> 02:22:09,458
Ooh la la, Ooh la Ia,
Ooh lala, Ooh lala

1838
02:22:09,542 --> 02:22:12,542
You are my fantasy

1839
02:22:13,375 --> 02:22:17,125
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

1840
02:22:17,208 --> 02:22:20,542
I am a young lady now

1841
02:22:21,042 --> 02:22:24,708
Ooh la la, Ooh la Ia,
Ooh lala, Ooh lala

1842
02:22:24,833 --> 02:22:27,083
You are my fantasy

1843
02:22:28,625 --> 02:22:32,333
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

1844
02:22:32,417 --> 02:22:36,042
I am a young lady now

1845
02:23:02,542 --> 02:23:04,458
When touched by you

1846
02:23:04,542 --> 02:23:06,333
my heart whistled

1847
02:23:06,417 --> 02:23:10,208
Give me a sweet kiss on my cheeks

1848
02:23:10,292 --> 02:23:12,083
When touched by you

1849
02:23:12,167 --> 02:23:13,458
my heart whistled

1850
02:23:13,542 --> 02:23:17,792
Give me a sweet kiss on my cheeks

1851
02:23:17,875 --> 02:23:21,542
Your youth, is fluid

1852
02:23:21,667 --> 02:23:25,417
which has drenched my heart

1853
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:27,333
Aha you brought the rain

1854
02:23:27,417 --> 02:23:31,417
what could my poor youth do?

1855
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:35,208
Ooh la la, Ooh la Ia,
Ooh lala, Ooh lala

1856
02:23:35,292 --> 02:23:37,750
You are my fantasy

1857
02:23:37,833 --> 02:23:39,000
No no no no no

1858
02:23:39,083 --> 02:23:42,833
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

1859
02:23:42,917 --> 02:23:46,542
I am a young lady now

1860
02:24:09,083 --> 02:24:12,333
By dropping your saree

1861
02:24:12,417 --> 02:24:16,375
repeatedly

1862
02:24:16,958 --> 02:24:23,875
you make me restless

1863
02:24:24,292 --> 02:24:27,625
By dropping your saree

1864
02:24:27,708 --> 02:24:31,458
repeatedly

1865
02:24:32,125 --> 02:24:38,792
you make me restless

1866
02:24:39,792 --> 02:24:41,583
After storming a fire in me

1867
02:24:41,667 --> 02:24:44,417
what can the poor saree do

1868
02:24:45,042 --> 02:24:46,583
Poor thing

1869
02:24:46,667 --> 02:24:48,292
Oh poor thing

1870
02:24:49,333 --> 02:24:52,375
I will tease you

1871
02:24:52,458 --> 02:24:55,417
you are a bombastic girl

1872
02:24:55,500 --> 02:24:57,000
Oh no.
