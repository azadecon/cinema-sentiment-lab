to a private English medium...</font>

140
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,317
<font color="#c0c0c0">...you should have sent me
to a Government school.</font>

141
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,883
<font color="#c0c0c0">I wouldn't have gotten
addicted to English.</font>

142
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,024
<font color="#c0c0c0">Or you should have married me off
right after school.</font>

143
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,290
<font color="#c0c0c0">You know lesser the age,
lesser the dowry!</font>

144
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,866
<font color="#c0c0c0">If I had married you off at sixteen
wouldn't I have been jailed?</font>

145
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,571
<font color="#c0c0c0">Won't you be jailed
for giving dowry?</font>

146
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,968
<font color="#c0c0c0">What can one do about that...</font>

147
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,702
<font color="#c0c0c0">In our country you can't buy a
house without paying black money...</font>

148
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,511
<font color="#c0c0c0">...and you can't get married
without dowry.</font>

149
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,869
<font color="#c0c0c0">God knows how many baby girls
are killed everyday...</font>

150
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,004
<font color="#c0c0c0">...by their own parents.</font>

151
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,717
<font color="#c0c0c0">You too should have given me
rat poison, with gulabjamun.</font>

152
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,883
<font color="#c0c0c0">The whole dowry head-ache
would be over.</font>

153
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,586
<font color="#c0c0c0">Don't talk nonsense.</font>

154
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,081
<font color="#c0c0c0">Only two years left
for my retirement.</font>

155
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,754
<font color="#c0c0c0">Soon as you get hitched,
I can rest easy.</font>

156
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,689
<font color="#c0c0c0">Hitched? I don't want
to get sorted Booji</font>

157
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,528
<font color="#c0c0c0">Yes, you just want to unsettle me!</font>

158
00:10:56,355 --> 00:11:00,497
<font color="#c0c0c0">Everylhing will be fine, just stop
bringing jerks to marry me off.</font>

159
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,798
<font color="#c0c0c0">Of course Gulluji,
the boys I call are all jerks.</font>

160
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,006
<font color="#c0c0c0">You only want Mr. World...</font>

161
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:07,273
<font color="#c0c0c0">...no Miss World?</font>

162
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,844
<font color="#c0c0c0">Why Mr. World,
I'll get Mr. Universe.</font>

163
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,016
<font color="#c0c0c0">Sure you will!</font>

164
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,675
<font color="#c0c0c0">- Khuda Hafiz.
- Khuda Hafiz.</font>

165
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,652
<font color="#c0c0c0">Mr. Qadir...Sir,
please hear me out...</font>

166
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,859
<font color="#c0c0c0">Sir, you are the senior-most
clerk in the registrar's office...</font>

167
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,589
<font color="#c0c0c0">...you can postpone my boss's
court date if you want.</font>

168
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,993
<font color="#c0c0c0">You will profit in exchange.</font>

169
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,364
<font color="#c0c0c0">I don't want your profit.</font>

170
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,094
<font color="#c0c0c0">Sir, cash or kind, your choice.</font>

171
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,773
<font color="#c0c0c0">You can take the whole family
on a vacation to America.</font>

172
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,908
<font color="#c0c0c0">Recently Mr. Mudgil
took his family there...</font>

173
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,009
<font color="#c0c0c0">I said no! Now get out of here!</font>

174
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:43,479
<font color="#c0c0c0">You moron!</font>

175
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,572
<font color="#c0c0c0">The date will get changed anyhow.</font>

176
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,915
<font color="#c0c0c0">Mr. Qadir... why so stressed?</font>

177
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,586
<font color="#c0c0c0">They are openly
spreading corruption!</font>

178
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:53,213
<font color="#c0c0c0">Forget about him. Want to bet
on the Raja Radha Reddy case?</font>

179
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,721
<font color="#c0c0c0">It's a bet! Raja Reddy
will get six years in jail.</font>

180
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,494
<font color="#c0c0c0">What are you saying Mr. Qadir?</font>

181
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,924
<font color="#c0c0c0">Raja Reddy supplies milk
to the whole state...</font>

182
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,258
<font color="#c0c0c0">...he's the 'Milk King'...</font>

183
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,991
<font color="#c0c0c0">Nobody is king
when it comes to 498a.</font>

<font color="#c0c0c0">Radha Reddy has filed a case of
dowry harassment under section 498a.</font>

if the husband is found guilty...</font>

186
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:13,173
<font color="#c0c0c0">...he goes straight to jail.</font>

187
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,677
<font color="#c0c0c0">Mr. Supreme Court, you will lose.</font>

188
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,278
<font color="#c0c0c0">We'll see who wins!</font>

189
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:21,845
<font color="#c0c0c0">Radha Reddy, victorious in the dowry
harassment case, thanks to 498a.</font>

justice to Radha Reddy...</font>

275
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,316
<font color="#c0c0c0">You're an old longing,
A new playfulness.</font>

276
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:27,716
<font color="#c0c0c0">Make me believe
Are you for real or not?</font>

277
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,053
<font color="#c0c0c0">Oh my, my tongue is slipping-</font>

278
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:36,730
<font color="#c0c0c0">I have turned poetic!</font>

279
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,975
<font color="#c0c0c0">I'm humming, I've turned romantic...</font>

280
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:50,477
<font color="#c0c0c0">I have turned poetic!</font>

281
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:11,430
<font color="#c0c0c0">Poetic, poetic,
I've turned poetic...</font>

282
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,668
<font color="#c0c0c0">The moon tricks me and walks away,</font>

283
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,971
<font color="#c0c0c0">It appears to me in the day.</font>

284
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:26,244
<font color="#c0c0c0">It picks new dreams for me...</font>

285
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:31,154
<font color="#c0c0c0">It pulls me by the arm,
The wind blows me away,</font>

286
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,485
<font color="#c0c0c0">It finds new ways for me.</font>

287
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:39,990
<font color="#c0c0c0">Poetic, poetic,
I've turned poetic...</font>

288
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,269
<font color="#c0c0c0">You're an old habit,
You're brand new trouble.</font>

289
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,876
<font color="#c0c0c0">Make me believe,
Are you for real or not?</font>

290
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,939
<font color="#c0c0c0">Oh my, my tongue is slipping-</font>

291
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:04,583
<font color="#c0c0c0">I have turned poetic!</font>

292
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:13,964
<font color="#c0c0c0">I'm humming, I've turned romantic...</font>

293
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:18,297
<font color="#c0c0c0">I have turned poetic!</font>

294
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:24,969
<font color="#c0c0c0">Enough!</font>

295
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,342
<font color="#c0c0c0">I'm hungry...let's eat kababs?</font>

296
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:29,844
<font color="#c0c0c0">I am a vegetarian.</font>

297
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,045
<font color="#c0c0c0">Really?</font>

298
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,280
<font color="#c0c0c0">Everyone is turning
vegetarian in America.</font>

299
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,321
<font color="#c0c0c0">Amjad! What will we do?</font>

300
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,016
<font color="#c0c0c0">I love you,
but I love Nalli, nahari...</font>

301
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,285
<font color="#c0c0c0">...kabab, biryani,
haleem also very much.</font>

302
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,159
<font color="#c0c0c0">I'm a hard-core non!</font>

303
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,195
<font color="#c0c0c0">So you eat. Yes, you can eat.</font>

304
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,658
<font color="#c0c0c0">Who's stopping you?</font>

305
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,365
<font color="#c0c0c0">All relationships are like
that in America...</font>

306
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,001
<font color="#c0c0c0">...you do what you like,
I'll do what I like.</font>

307
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,132
<font color="#c0c0c0">I really love you!</font>

308
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,702
<font color="#c0c0c0">Remember this my friend...today
I will eat only vegetarian with you.</font>

309
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:03,639
<font color="#c0c0c0">Gullu...</font>

310
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,481
<font color="#c0c0c0">Let's begin the gift ceremony.</font>

311
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,684
<font color="#c0c0c0">Bride's mother will gift
a brand new car...</font>

312
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,494
<font color="#c0c0c0">Mummy, come on mummy!</font>

313
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:24,994
<font color="#c0c0c0">Thank you amma</font>

314
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,901
<font color="#c0c0c0">Bride's uncle will gift
two pure gold wrist watches...</font>

315
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,373
<font color="#c0c0c0">One for the left hand,
one for the right.</font>

316
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:36,909
<font color="#c0c0c0">Very nice dowry</font>

317
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:38,480
<font color="#c0c0c0">On top of all the gifts...</font>

318
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,313
<font color="#c0c0c0">I have given one crore cash dowry
to Pooja's in laws.</font>

319
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,247
<font color="#c0c0c0">Pooja's husband is an IAS,
that's his rate.</font>

320
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:46,886
<font color="#c0c0c0">Gullu!</font>

324
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:57,999
<font color="#c0c0c0">Give her a big hand!</font>

325
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,525
<font color="#c0c0c0">Please</font>

326
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:06,936
<font color="#c0c0c0">A mixer griander and 32 inch LED TV
from the bride's uncle in Dubai.</font>

327
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,009
<font color="#c0c0c0">You turned out to be quite brave...
coming here without an invitation.</font>

328
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,212
<font color="#c0c0c0">I missed you!</font>

329
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,506
<font color="#c0c0c0">I was too busy with the wedding...</font>

330
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:14,843
<font color="#c0c0c0">Pooja wouldn't let go of me...</font>

331
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,511
<font color="#c0c0c0">Gullu! I missed you so much!</font>

332
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,721
<font color="#c0c0c0">Will you have a love
marriage or arranged?</font>

333
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,855
<font color="#c0c0c0">My father will hang me from
the fan if I have a love marriage.</font>

334
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:29,961
<font color="#c0c0c0">You?</font>

335
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:36,536
<font color="#c0c0c0">My Booji...should be okay.
Hopefully.</font>

336
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:38,864
<font color="#c0c0c0">Did you tell Booji about me?</font>

337
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,342
<font color="#c0c0c0">No. Should I?</font>

338
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:45,575
<font color="#c0c0c0">Should I convince my father
to bring a proposal to your house?</font>

339
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,678
<font color="#c0c0c0">Are you proposing to me?</font>

340
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,985
<font color="#c0c0c0">We've been together
for more than a month.</font>

341
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,117
<font color="#c0c0c0">Okay!</font>

342
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,839
<font color="#c0c0c0">We rejecting boys speaking
English very badly...</font>

343
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,169
<font color="#c0c0c0">For Gullu, only good
English speaking.</font>

344
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,144
<font color="#c0c0c0">Amju-Gullu... Perfect coupling.</font>

345
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:25,516
<font color="#c0c0c0">You needn't worry about dowry,
we don't want anything.</font>

346
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,582
<font color="#c0c0c0">The love with which Amju has come,</font>

347
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,960
<font color="#c0c0c0">I mean all of you have
come from Jubilee Hills...</font>

348
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,329
<font color="#c0c0c0">...you would obviously not
bring the filth of dowry with you.</font>

349
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:37,293
<font color="#c0c0c0">Send you daughter in one outfit,
we'll be happy.</font>

350
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,399
<font color="#c0c0c0">We just need some help from you.</font>

351
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,868
<font color="#c0c0c0">Of course. What help?</font>

352
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,206
<font color="#c0c0c0">For his higher education.
I told you...</font>

353
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:47,568
<font color="#c0c0c0">Yes Kalamazoo!</font>

354
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,012
<font color="#c0c0c0">What a robust name, Kalamazoo.</font>

355
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,038
<font color="#c0c0c0">So... what help can I offer you?</font>

356
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:56,319
<font color="#c0c0c0">College tuition, travel expenses,
living and food expenses...</font>

357
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,985
<font color="#c0c0c0">...not for him alone...
for the bride as well.</font>

358
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:02,726
<font color="#c0c0c0">After marriage, we won't force
your daughter to stay with us.</font>

359
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,058
<font color="#c0c0c0">She will also go with Amju.</font>

360
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,657
<font color="#c0c0c0">We are very open minded...</font>

361
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:09,997
<font color="#c0c0c0">Very good...</font>

362
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:12,860
<font color="#c0c0c0">Amju, I hear you're a vegetarian?</font>

363
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:16,434
<font color="#c0c0c0">Here, the help list!</font>

364
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,370
<font color="#c0c0c0">Oh okay...</font>

365
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,076
<font color="#c0c0c0">It's just eight lakhs.</font>

366
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,576
<font color="#c0c0c0">Not eight, eighty.</font>

367
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:32,347
<font color="#c0c0c0">Eighty!</font>

368
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,748
<font color="#c0c0c0">Please go through it.
It's all accounted.</font>

369
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,892
<font color="#c0c0c0">Every penny will be spent on them.
Nothing on us.</font>

370
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,356
<font color="#c0c0c0">You never said anything
about this Amju?</font>

371
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,670
<font color="#c0c0c0">Have you spoken
to Gulrez before this?</font>

372
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,367
<font color="#c0c0c0">Yes... he's spoken to me,
held my hand...</font>

373
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,298
<font color="#c0c0c0">Said I love you a hundred times.</font>

374
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:55,535
<font color="#c0c0c0">0k... but the match is being made
with our permission.</font>

375
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:56,838
<font color="#c0c0c0">It is arranged.</font>

376
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,040
<font color="#c0c0c0">Amju, how can you do this
if you love me...</font>

377
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,311
<font color="#c0c0c0">...how can you ask for money?</font>

378
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,112
<font color="#c0c0c0">This is understood dear.</font>

379
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,287
<font color="#c0c0c0">He will go to America,
get educated, earn millions...</font>

380
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,852
<font color="#c0c0c0">...only you will enjoy the benefits.</font>

381
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,853
<font color="#c0c0c0">We're just asking your father
for some help...</font>

382
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,258
<font color="#c0c0c0">...not asking him
to build the Charminar!</font>

383
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,634
<font color="#c0c0c0">But you are educated,
with an American accent...</font>

384
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:18,997
<font color="#c0c0c0">...going to do your MBA...</font>

385
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,129
<font color="#c0c0c0">So?</font>

386
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:24,635
<font color="#c0c0c0">Doctors, engineers,
IAS, IPS, all ask for help.</font>

387
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,739
<font color="#c0c0c0">What's wrong with MBA?</font>

388
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:30,070
<font color="#c0c0c0">Amju, I'm an ordinary sales-girl,
where will I get eighty lakhs from?</font>

389
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,650
<font color="#c0c0c0">But your father works
at the court...high court!</font>

390
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,519
<font color="#c0c0c0">Yes, but I'm merely a clerk,
not a lawyer.</font>

391
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,979
<font color="#c0c0c0">My salary is only thirty
thousand per month.</font>

392
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:44,187
<font color="#c0c0c0">I have some jewellery
and cash for the dowry...</font>

393
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:48,025
<font color="#c0c0c0">Hey, hey, who's asking for dowry...
Help, help!</font>

394
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,761
<font color="#c0c0c0">Sorry help...
I can help up to fifteen lakhs.</font>

395
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,198
<font color="#c0c0c0">Fifteen?</font>

396
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:57,768
<font color="#c0c0c0">Nowadays even the note-books
cost more in America...</font>

397
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,144
<font color="#c0c0c0">There's a long line of people
waiting to help my Amju.</font>

398
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,040
<font color="#c0c0c0">Not bits and pieces, full help.</font>

399
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:09,481
<font color="#c0c0c0">Amjad, you won't say anything?</font>

400
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,558
<font color="#c0c0c0">Dad, my education will cost
only sixty lakhs...</font>

401
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:17,987
<font color="#c0c0c0">...why are you asking for eigthy?</font>

402
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:18,990
<font color="#c0c0c0">That's unfair.</font>

403
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,529
<font color="#c0c0c0">Unfair? What's unfair?</font>

404
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,324
<font color="#c0c0c0">I pawned my jewellery to send you
to an English medium school...</font>

405
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,638
<font color="#c0c0c0">...now you're misbehaving with us
in fluent English!</font>

406
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:31,997
<font color="#c0c0c0">I'm Sorry...</font>

407
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,175
<font color="#c0c0c0">- Amju!
- Gullu</font>

408
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,076
<font color="#c0c0c0">My Child!</font>

409
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,174
<font color="#c0c0c0">What kind of misbehaviour is this?</font>

411
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:44,945
<font color="#c0c0c0">...no burger, no hot-dog,
no cold-drink, no help... Nothing.</font>

412
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:46,019
<font color="#c0c0c0">Get out of here...</font>

413
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:47,689
<font color="#c0c0c0">- Get out...out!

414
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:48,724
<font color="#c0c0c0">Gullu calm down...</font>

415
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,950
<font color="#c0c0c0">Leave! Just leave!</font>

416
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:51,491
<font color="#c0c0c0">I love you Gullu.</font>

417
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,585

418
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,896
<font color="#c0c0c0">Gullu, I want to go
to Kalamazoo with you...</font>

with you...</font>

420
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:00,459
<font color="#c0c0c0">Go hang yourself...
bloody vegetarian!</font>

421
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,600
<font color="#c0c0c0">- Gullu! Gullu!
- Let's go!</font>

422
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,134
<font color="#c0c0c0">Mr. Abdul Qadir! This is not right!</font>

423
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,138
<font color="#c0c0c0">Your daughter has made a very
big mistake! A very big mistake!</font>

424
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,544
<font color="#c0c0c0">Get lost...
or I'll beat you to a pulp.</font>

425

Here, take help...take help...</font>

426
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,407
<font color="#c0c0c0">Radha Reddy Ma'am, your husband
has been jailed for six years...</font>

427
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:14,803
<font color="#c0c0c0">...how does it feel?</font>

428
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,011
<font color="#c0c0c0">I am very happy, thanks to 498a...</font>

429

has sent my husband to jail...</font>

430
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:22,244
<font color="#c0c0c0">...ordered him to give
me ten crores cash...</font>

431
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,784
<font color="#c0c0c0">...a flat to live in and four lakhs
monthly alimony.</font>

432
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,646
<font color="#c0c0c0">Long live 498a.</font>

433
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,515
<font color="#c0c0c0">They cook the most delicious
biryani... Amazing!</font>

434
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,015
<font color="#c0c0c0">Try this piece, it's very tasty...</font>

435
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,216
<font color="#c0c0c0">No, no... I'm done.</font>

436
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:03,485
<font color="#c0c0c0">With the baghaare baingan...</font>

437
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:04,590
<font color="#c0c0c0">Ok fine.</font>

438
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,127
<font color="#c0c0c0">Only after giving anaesthesia
of my favourite food...</font>

439
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:13,225
<font color="#c0c0c0">...from my favourite restaurant,
will you perform surgery...</font>

440
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,164
<font color="#c0c0c0">Out with it...what's up?</font>

441
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:22,108
<font color="#c0c0c0">Booji, I don't want
to get married at all...</font>

442
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:26,914
<font color="#c0c0c0">...whether it's a bilu flim cheapster
or an American accent MBA.</font>

443
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:30,182
<font color="#c0c0c0">Nobody values companionship,
friendship, love, affection...</font>

444
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,477
<font color="#c0c0c0">...they're all just parasites.</font>

445
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,483
<font color="#c0c0c0">All boys are not alike Gullu.</font>

446
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,961
<font color="#c0c0c0">They are Booji, you don't know!</font>

447
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:47,198
<font color="#c0c0c0">Have your cold-drink.</font>

448
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:56,307
<font color="#c0c0c0">Anyway, I have decided...
I will fulfill my dreams.</font>

449
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,036
<font color="#c0c0c0">You and I are going to New York.</font>

450
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:01,009
<font color="#c0c0c0">I will study Fashion Designing,
I will be a famous shoe designer.</font>

451
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:02,307
<font color="#c0c0c0">You just enjoy!</font>

452
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,417
<font color="#c0c0c0">Come on, which bank will we rob?</font>

453
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:13,519
<font color="#c0c0c0">We will put 498a, like Radha Reddy.</font>

454
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,832
<font color="#c0c0c0">It's a law, not nail-polish!</font>

455
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,969
<font color="#c0c0c0">We'll use the law.</font>

456
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:25,804
<font color="#c0c0c0">First, we will change
our name and appearance...</font>

457
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:29,673
<font color="#c0c0c0">...and post my photo and bio-data
on a matrimonial site.</font>

458
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,346
<font color="#c0c0c0">Boys will line up to marry me.</font>

459
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,712
<font color="#c0c0c0">We will interview them...</font>

460
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:40,718
<font color="#c0c0c0">...and choose the most
greedy scoundrel.</font>

461
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,649
<font color="#c0c0c0">I will marry him in a fake ceremony.</font>

462
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,285
<font color="#c0c0c0">The next day we will use 498a...</font>

463
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:49,560
<font color="#c0c0c0">...and file a dowry harassment case
against the groom and his family.</font>

464
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:53,058
<font color="#c0c0c0">To avoid jail-time they will agree
to an out of court settlement.</font>

465
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,870
<font color="#c0c0c0">We will then ask for eighty lakhs
in cash! They will have to pay up.</font>

466
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,735
<font color="#c0c0c0">We will take that money
and off to New York.</font>

467
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:02,502
<font color="#c0c0c0">Isn't it a great idea!</font>

468
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:08,507
<font color="#c0c0c0">You want to bribe me with dinner
to pass this dangerous plan?</font>

469
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,048
<font color="#c0c0c0">There's no danger Booji!</font>

470
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,280
<font color="#c0c0c0">Shut up... just shut up!</font>

471
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,152
<font color="#c0c0c0">Never speak of this
stupid plan again!</font>

472
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:18,185
<font color="#c0c0c0">Let's go!</font>

473
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:19,361
<font color="#c0c0c0">You think you're too smart...
trying to use 498a</font>

474
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,224
<font color="#c0c0c0">Booji!</font>

475
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,228
<font color="#c0c0c0">Hey ldrees, clean table number seven</font>

476
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,032
<font color="#c0c0c0">- Slalekum!

477
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,367
<font color="#c0c0c0">My tea today!</font>

478
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:38,472
<font color="#c0c0c0">You're up very early.</font>

479
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,340
<font color="#c0c0c0">I was planning all night.</font>

480
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,886
<font color="#c0c0c0">We will change our name, dress,
appearance and look for our target.</font>

481
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:50,049
<font color="#c0c0c0">Not here, everyone knows us
in Hyderabad. In some other city.</font>

482
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:51,491
<font color="#c0c0c0">Don't start again!</font>

483
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,354
<font color="#c0c0c0">Listen to the full plan at least...</font>

484
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,022
<font color="#c0c0c0">We will go fully prepared.</font>

485
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,395
<font color="#c0c0c0">I've found out the name of the guy
who makes fake passports...</font>

486
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,798
<font color="#c0c0c0">...here in Laad Bazaar,
he'll make it in two days.</font>

487
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,937
<font color="#c0c0c0">Don't worry, I will wear a veil
while giving the photo and money.</font>

488
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:04,530
<font color="#c0c0c0">- He wont recognize...
- Stop it now!</font>

489
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:07,705
<font color="#c0c0c0">If Bilqees and Rukmani hear this,
they will report you.</font>

490
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,309
<font color="#c0c0c0">We will have to buy
hundred dirhams...</font>

491
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,678
<font color="#c0c0c0">...we will photocopy those
and make bundles.</font>

492
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:15,844
<font color="#c0c0c0">What?</font>

493
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:19,453
<font color="#c0c0c0">We need cash for all this,
so break the dowry deposit.</font>

494
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,285
<font color="#c0c0c0">It will finance the whole mission.</font>

495
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,019
<font color="#c0c0c0">Where did you learn all this from?</font>

496
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,225
<font color="#c0c0c0">The internet has everything...</font>

497
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,295
<font color="#c0c0c0">...from child delivery
to bomb making, all recipes.</font>

498
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,695
<font color="#c0c0c0">Anyway... One minute...
Bhopal, Ahmedabad, Delhi, Lucknow.</font>

499
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,233
<font color="#c0c0c0">- Where do you want to go?
- Jail!</font>

500
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,602
<font color="#c0c0c0">Tell me Booji,
I have to book the tickets.</font>

501
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:37,362
<font color="#c0c0c0">Booji!</font>

502
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,508
<font color="#c0c0c0">The whole world asks for dowry!</font>

503
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:44,339
<font color="#c0c0c0">If I con some money out of a greedy
dowry monger, what's the big deal?</font>

504
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:49,683
<font color="#c0c0c0">In India, one woman is killed
for dowry every hour!</font>

505
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,520
<font color="#c0c0c0">I swear by Google...
see for yourself.</font>

506
00:31:56,481 --> 00:32:00,054
<font color="#c0c0c0">Booji, we've been insulted a lot.</font>

507
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:01,858
<font color="#c0c0c0">Now we will avenge those insults.</font>

508
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,561
<font color="#c0c0c0">We will fulfill our dreams.</font>

509
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,334
<font color="#c0c0c0">Don't marry, if you don't want to.</font>

510
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,165
<font color="#c0c0c0">If you want to study...
study right here in India.</font>

511
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,440
<font color="#c0c0c0">We have Fashion Designing here too.</font>

512
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:16,000
<font color="#c0c0c0">I will only study
in the New York College.</font>

513
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:19,740
<font color="#c0c0c0">If you don't want to help, then
don't. I will do everything myself.</font>

514
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,676
<font color="#c0c0c0">If you commit this crime Gullu...</font>

515
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,647
<font color="#c0c0c0">I will report you myself
and send you to jail.</font>

516
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,751
<font color="#c0c0c0">Ok, I will marry the
"Bilu Flim" jerk tomorrow.</font>

<font color="#c0c0c0">Gullu don't be stubbborn...</font>

519
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,686
<font color="#c0c0c0">Who knows, he will make
a blue film of me!</font>

520
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:33,895
<font color="#c0c0c0">Then you'll be happy?</font>

521
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:36,029

523
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:41,299
<font color="#c0c0c0">Ok don't, I won't either!</font>

524

525
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:53,772
<font color="#c0c0c0">Did you get hurt?</font>

526
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,047
<font color="#c0c0c0">What happened?</font>

527
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:56,983
<font color="#c0c0c0">Don't you know how to drive?</font>

528
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,179
<font color="#c0c0c0">- Sorry, I blew the horn...
- What happened?</font>

529
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,016
<font color="#c0c0c0">- ...but he didn't hear madam...

532
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:05,359

Thank you.</font>

535
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,160

536
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:15,470
<font color="#c0c0c0">Sir my father has had an accident,
how can I leave him alone?</font>

537
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,139
<font color="#c0c0c0">It's an emergency leave Sir.</font>

538

00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,360
<font color="#c0c0c0">Wait, wait...</font>

953
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,022
<font color="#c0c0c0">Tariq Haidar's house.</font>

954
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,596
<font color="#c0c0c0">What an amazing mansion</font>

955
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:01,967
<font color="#c0c0c0">It is...</font>

956
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:05,498
<font color="#c0c0c0">They have 3 cars!</font>

957
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:10,011
<font color="#c0c0c0">Yes! That red one is too sexy Booji.</font>

958
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:12,644
<font color="#c0c0c0">- It's too amazing
- Yes, sorry</font>

959
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:13,974
<font color="#c0c0c0">One thing is clear...</font>

960
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:18,009
<font color="#c0c0c0">A court case will damage
their reputation the most.</font>

961
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:19,486
<font color="#c0c0c0">They are wealthy too.</font>

962
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:22,619
<font color="#c0c0c0">They will be able to immediately
pay the cash we demand. What say?</font>

963
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:24,416
<font color="#c0c0c0">All that is fine...</font>

964
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:26,658
<font color="#c0c0c0">...but I will have to roam
around Lucknow for three days...</font>

965
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,990
<font color="#c0c0c0">...with that kababster Tariq!</font>

966
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:29,820
<font color="#c0c0c0">And what if he says
no after three days?</font>

967
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:34,162
<font color="#c0c0c0">We won't let him... I'll play
negative, you play positive.</font>

968
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:35,027
<font color="#c0c0c0">Meaning?</font>

969
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:38,004
<font color="#c0c0c0">Meaning... I will bad mouth
everything he does...</font>

970
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:39,569
<font color="#c0c0c0">...but you praise him.</font>

971
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:41,636
<font color="#c0c0c0">He will surely end up liking you.</font>

972
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:44,804
<font color="#c0c0c0">Yes.</font>

973
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:49,642
<font color="#c0c0c0">Her father was ready,
your parents were ready...</font>

974
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:52,184
<font color="#c0c0c0">...even the dowry was enough
to keep our head held high.</font>

975
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:55,022
<font color="#c0c0c0">What was the need to put
these stupid conditions Taru?</font>

976
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:58,349
<font color="#c0c0c0">If she likes me even a little bit,
she will agree.</font>

977
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:00,519
<font color="#c0c0c0">And if she doesn't?
You're getting old...</font>

978
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:01,922
<font color="#c0c0c0">When will he marry?</font>

979
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:04,287
<font color="#c0c0c0">I will marry the one who loves me
at least a little bit...</font>

980
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,764
<font color="#c0c0c0">...if not a whole lot.</font>

981
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:07,525
<font color="#c0c0c0">No chance of you finding
someone who will love you.</font>

982
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,828
<font color="#c0c0c0">Wherever you go,
you put these conditions.</font>

983
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:13,168
<font color="#c0c0c0">Or tell us where we can
find you a fairy queen...</font>

984
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:15,034
<font color="#c0c0c0">...we'll go and get her...</font>

985
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:25,145
<font color="#c0c0c0">So Taru, did she accept
your condition?</font>

986
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:27,914
<font color="#c0c0c0">She will accept Mr. Chaudhary,
she will.</font>

987
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,684
<font color="#c0c0c0">Did she call?</font>

988
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:30,983
<font color="#c0c0c0">She will Nanhe miyan...</font>

989
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:32,988
<font color="#c0c0c0">If she doesn't call,
what will you do Taru bhai?</font>

990
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:34,791
<font color="#c0c0c0">Then where will you get
a moon-like bride for yourself?</font>

991
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:52,842
<font color="#c0c0c0">I want not the moon,</font>

992
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,076
<font color="#c0c0c0">Nor the night bird,</font>

993
00:57:56,172 --> 00:58:00,245
<font color="#c0c0c0">Nor a slice of sky.</font>

994
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,948
<font color="#c0c0c0">I want not the light,</font>

995
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:04,216
<font color="#c0c0c0">Nor a fairy</font>

996
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:09,453
<font color="#c0c0c0">Nor a fairy-face.</font>

997
00:58:09,752 --> 00:58:10,890
<font color="#c0c0c0">She who walks with me,</font>

998
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,091
<font color="#c0c0c0">She who tastes with me,</font>

999
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,260
<font color="#c0c0c0">Each joy and each sweet sorrow.</font>

1000
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,595
<font color="#c0c0c0">I'll wake her from her dreams...</font>

1001
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:16,796
<font color="#c0c0c0">In my arms I'll make her sleep,</font>

1002
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:17,928
<font color="#c0c0c0">I'll pamper her,</font>

1003
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:19,668
<font color="#c0c0c0">I'll feed her all my life,</font>

1004
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:24,468
<font color="#c0c0c0">The heart has laid out a buffet,</font>

1005
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:30,851
<font color="#c0c0c0">The heart has laid out a buffet,
it's the feast of love.</font>

1006
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:38,050
<font color="#c0c0c0">If you accept the invitation,
please do come my love.</font>

1007
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,058
<font color="#c0c0c0">It's the feast of love.</font>

1008
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:47,631
<font color="#c0c0c0">The heart has laid out a buffet</font>

1009
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:24,267
<font color="#c0c0c0">I have laid out a carpet
of clouds for you...</font>

1010
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:28,972
<font color="#c0c0c0">I have decked out trays
of stars for you...</font>

1011
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:33,679
<font color="#c0c0c0">Why did you trouble
the moon and stars for me?</font>

1012
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:37,974
<font color="#c0c0c0">Wherever I go sunshine follows me</font>

1013
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:42,650
<font color="#c0c0c0">Your words are sugary sweet...</font>

1014
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:47,493
<font color="#c0c0c0">What about your feast?
Is it sweet as your words?</font>

1015
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:52,161
<font color="#c0c0c0">If you come, my bland party
will turn delicious.</font>

1016
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:56,837
<font color="#c0c0c0">If your party is bland,
why should I come?</font>

1017
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:58,437
<font color="#c0c0c0">If you tell me to...</font>

1018
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:02,271
<font color="#c0c0c0">I will fire all the dishes
with the warmth of my heart...</font>

1019
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:05,642
<font color="#c0c0c0">The heart has laid out a buffet,</font>

1020
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:12,384
<font color="#c0c0c0">The heart has laid out a buffet,
it is the feast of love.</font>

1021
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:19,486
<font color="#c0c0c0">If you accept the invitation,
please do come my love.</font>

1022
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:21,755
<font color="#c0c0c0">It is the feast of love.</font>

1023
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:40,336
<font color="#c0c0c0">Feast of love,
It's the feast of love.</font>

1024
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:49,413
<font color="#c0c0c0">Love mixed in the drinks
for the feast of love.</font>

1025
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:54,124
<font color="#c0c0c0">That's adulteration
in the feast of love.</font>

1026
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:58,790
<font color="#c0c0c0">Only the fortunate get
invited to the feast of love.</font>

1027
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:03,461
<font color="#c0c0c0">Who has the time to waste,
on the feast of love.</font>

1028
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:05,831
<font color="#c0c0c0">Don't dismiss, just taste.</font>

1029
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:08,133
<font color="#c0c0c0">Don't hyper-ventilate.</font>

1030
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:10,438
<font color="#c0c0c0">Let's get connected</font>

1031
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,639
<font color="#c0c0c0">Let's think about it</font>

1032
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:14,978
<font color="#c0c0c0">Not with thought, nor with tact,</font>

1033
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:18,152
<font color="#c0c0c0">I've invited you with my heart.</font>

1034
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:28,453
<font color="#c0c0c0">Ok then...l accept...</font>

1035
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:35,067
<font color="#c0c0c0">I accept your feast of love.</font>

1036
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:39,704
<font color="#c0c0c0">Yes Sir,
I agree to your feast of love.</font>

1037
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,289
<font color="#c0c0c0">It's the feast of love...</font>

1038
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:03,727
<font color="#c0c0c0">It's the feast of love...</font>

1039
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:07,526
<font color="#c0c0c0">It's the feast of love...</font>

1040
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:11,534
<font color="#c0c0c0">It's love, it's love,
the feast of love...</font>

1041
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:15,370
<font color="#c0c0c0">It's the feast of love...</font>

1042
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:16,642
<font color="#c0c0c0">It's love!</font>

1043
01:02:24,442 --> 01:02:25,216
<font color="#c0c0c0">Come on Farru</font>

1044
01:02:30,448 --> 01:02:32,894
<font color="#c0c0c0">Remember, you positive, me negative.</font>

1045
01:02:34,853 --> 01:02:37,265
<font color="#c0c0c0">Slalekum! Hope you slept
peacefully last night.</font>

1046
01:02:37,422 --> 01:02:40,130
<font color="#c0c0c0">No peace at all...
your hotels are rubbish...</font>

1047
01:02:40,358 --> 01:02:41,098
<font color="#c0c0c0">Our Dubai has the best...</font>

1048
01:02:41,192 --> 01:02:43,866
<font color="#c0c0c0">Oh daddy, their hotels are fine too.</font>

1049
01:02:44,829 --> 01:02:47,867
<font color="#c0c0c0">Hello Fareeda. You've come
to take us sight-seeing?</font>

1050
01:02:48,066 --> 01:02:50,046
<font color="#c0c0c0">I have no interest
in being a third wheel!</font>

1051
01:02:50,368 --> 01:02:53,508
<font color="#c0c0c0">But Taru bhai promised me a new
phone if I agree to come along.</font>

1052
01:02:53,705 --> 01:02:55,878
<font color="#c0c0c0">My phone is too old.
That's the only reason I'm here.</font>

1053
01:02:56,741 --> 01:02:58,152
<font color="#c0c0c0">Fareeda and her tall-tales!</font>

1054
01:02:59,377 --> 01:03:01,516
<font color="#c0c0c0">Come on Sania. Uncle, Khuda Hafiz.</font>

1055
01:03:02,514 --> 01:03:03,686
<font color="#c0c0c0">Uncle will go as well.</font>

1056
01:03:04,182 --> 01:03:04,887
<font color="#c0c0c0">Uncle will go as well?</font>

1057
01:03:05,684 --> 01:03:06,890
<font color="#c0c0c0">If Fareeda has come with you...</font>

1058
01:03:07,085 --> 01:03:09,224
<font color="#c0c0c0">...someone from our side will
have to go as her body guard.</font>

1059
01:03:09,888 --> 01:03:11,595
<font color="#c0c0c0">Come on uncle, your daughter
doesn't need a body guard...</font>

1060
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:13,563
<font color="#c0c0c0">...she can bury ten bodies
with one hand.</font>

1061
01:03:13,725 --> 01:03:15,329
<font color="#c0c0c0">Come on Sania, he doesn't agree.</font>

1062
01:03:15,393 --> 01:03:17,066
<font color="#c0c0c0">No no... come, please come.</font>

1063
01:03:17,162 --> 01:03:17,936
<font color="#c0c0c0">If only you had told me...</font>

1064
01:03:18,029 --> 01:03:20,270
<font color="#c0c0c0">I would have brought along papa,
mummy, uncles and aunties as well.</font>

1065
01:03:20,432 --> 01:03:21,740
<font color="#c0c0c0">You could have set the tuning
with the entire clan. Right?</font>

1066
01:03:23,101 --> 01:03:24,637
<font color="#c0c0c0">He is so funny daddy</font>

1067
01:03:25,203 --> 01:03:25,943
<font color="#c0c0c0">Let's go!</font>

1068
01:03:27,338 --> 01:03:27,907
<font color="#c0c0c0">Let's go!</font>

1069
01:03:27,972 --> 01:03:28,916
<font color="#c0c0c0">So Tariq Haider...</font>

1070
01:03:29,074 --> 01:03:31,111
<font color="#c0c0c0">- ...we would like to...
- Taru... people call me Taru, sir.</font>

1071
01:03:31,776 --> 01:03:34,586
<font color="#c0c0c0">We won't! It's a weird name-Tar...</font>

1072
01:03:34,746 --> 01:03:37,124
<font color="#c0c0c0">It's not weird daddy, I like it.</font>

1073
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:39,292
<font color="#c0c0c0">She like it!</font>

1074
01:03:40,752 --> 01:03:41,890
<font color="#c0c0c0">- How are you?
- Fine sir.</font>

1075
01:03:43,054 --> 01:03:43,862
<font color="#c0c0c0">Where's the car?</font>

1076
01:03:44,422 --> 01:03:45,696
<font color="#c0c0c0">Here it is, my Impala.</font>

1077
01:03:48,293 --> 01:03:49,829
<font color="#c0c0c0">This red box!</font>

1078
01:03:50,562 --> 01:03:51,734
<font color="#c0c0c0">We will go in this jalopy?</font>

1079
01:03:51,896 --> 01:03:53,807
<font color="#c0c0c0">Entire Lucknow is crazy
about my Impala.</font>

1080
01:03:53,898 --> 01:03:56,071
<font color="#c0c0c0">Entire Lucknow may be crazy
about your Impala...</font>

1081
01:03:56,868 --> 01:03:59,314
<font color="#c0c0c0">...but Sania is used to luxury cars.</font>

1082
01:03:59,537 --> 01:04:01,312
<font color="#c0c0c0">Get a Mercedes or a Benz,
only then will we go.</font>

1083
01:04:01,372 --> 01:04:02,350
<font color="#c0c0c0">Or else, let's go back Sania.</font>

1084
01:04:02,607 --> 01:04:06,521
<font color="#c0c0c0">Oh daddy, now that
Tariq is insisting...</font>

1085
01:04:06,578 --> 01:04:08,751
<font color="#c0c0c0">I don't mind taking a round
or two in his Impala.</font>

1086
01:04:13,084 --> 01:04:13,721

even the heroine was so skinny.</font>

1120
01:05:48,213 --> 01:05:51,751

to marry less than a graduate.</font>

01:06:47,972 --> 01:06:49,349
<font color="#c0c0c0">How will we have tuning-setting?</font>

makes no difference.</font>

1141
01:07:01,286 --> 01:07:03,425
<font color="#c0c0c0">But we will educate our kids
very well. Right?</font>

1236
01:16:02,927 --> 01:16:04,964

for your cash value.</font>

1237
01:16:05,062 --> 01:16:06,632

1241
01:16:29,019 --> 01:16:32,330
<font color="#c0c0c0">I'm not an item for my papa
to sell and your daddy to buy.</font>

1242
01:16:34,425 --> 01:16:38,498
<font color="#c0c0c0">Papa doesn't understand.
His heart has attacked him once.</font>

1243
01:16:39,797 --> 01:16:40,901
<font color="#c0c0c0">I'm afraid of fighting him...</font>

1244
01:16:40,965 --> 01:16:42,967
<font color="#c0c0c0">...what if he passes away
without seeing his grand-children?</font>

1245
01:16:43,601 --> 01:16:44,579
<font color="#c0c0c0">He loves me a lot.</font>

1246
01:16:44,635 --> 01:16:46,205
<font color="#c0c0c0">But this disease of bowing
before society...</font>

1247

<font color="#c0c0c0">...and It's customs
doesn't leave him.</font>

1248

01:16:52,176 --> 01:16:53,382
<font color="#c0c0c0">So you tell your daddy...</font>

1251
01:16:53,544 --> 01:16:55,649
<font color="#c0c0c0">...to give my papa-mummy
this forty lakh rupees as dowry.</font>

1252
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:58,123

1256
01:17:21,939 --> 01:17:23,941
<font color="#c0c0c0">You love me a lot right?</font>

1257
01:17:26,277 --> 01:17:28,382
<font color="#c0c0c0">If I tell you something,
you won't be angry?</font>

1258
01:17:29,413 --> 01:17:30,153
<font color="#c0c0c0">No</font>

1259
01:17:30,948 --> 01:17:32,518

<font color="#c0c0c0">Yes</font>

1261

1275
01:18:20,264 --> 01:18:22,801
<font color="#c0c0c0">...that a scrap like me
would get a delicacy like you?</font>

1276
01:18:25,803 --> 01:18:29,615
<font color="#c0c0c0">Has anything expected
happened between us so far?</font>

1277
01:18:33,277 --> 01:18:34,415

<font color="#c0c0c0">Fake names, fake company,
fake passport...</font>

1490
01:32:17,834 --> 01:32:19,836
<font color="#c0c0c0">...and only one hundred dirham...</font>

1491
01:32:19,903 --> 01:32:21,439
<font color="#c0c0c0">...out of the three lakh
forty five thousand are real?</font>

1492
01:32:21,905 --> 01:32:23,475
<font color="#c0c0c0">- Where is Taru?
- On the roof again...</font>

1493
01:32:31,047 --> 01:32:31,855
<font color="#c0c0c0"><i>Tarn...</i></font>

1494
01:32:33,450 --> 01:32:35,396
<font color="#c0c0c0">What are you doing at that height?</font>

1495
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:46,874
<font color="#c0c0c0">Even if you chop all the
vegetables in the market...</font>

1496
01:32:47,130 --> 01:32:48,370
<font color="#c0c0c0">...your anger won't go away.</font>

1497
01:32:48,932 --> 01:32:51,037
<font color="#c0c0c0">It will go only when the father
and daughter will rot in jail.</font>

1498
01:32:53,203 --> 01:32:56,377
<font color="#c0c0c0">But if you keep chopping carrots,
how will we find them?</font>

1499
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:00,078
<font color="#c0c0c0">Think Taru, think about her...
We may find a clue...</font>

1500
01:33:01,711 --> 01:33:03,418
<font color="#c0c0c0">Her father had called her Gullu...</font>

1501
01:33:04,047 --> 01:33:04,855
<font color="#c0c0c0">So?</font>

1502
01:33:05,415 --> 01:33:07,861
<font color="#c0c0c0">How can a Sania's pet name be Gullu?</font>

1503
01:33:08,685 --> 01:33:10,358
<font color="#c0c0c0">There has to be some story
behind the name Gullu.</font>

1504
01:33:11,154 --> 01:33:16,763
<font color="#c0c0c0">Taru bhai!
I found your Gulrez Gullu Qadir...</font>

1505
01:33:17,827 --> 01:33:19,033
<font color="#c0c0c0">Come fast...</font>

1506
01:33:29,939 --> 01:33:30,644
<font color="#c0c0c0">What have you got?</font>

1507
01:33:30,874 --> 01:33:32,478
<font color="#c0c0c0">Just breathe, I'm showing you...</font>

1508
01:33:33,109 --> 01:33:36,716
<font color="#c0c0c0">Look at this...
She thinks she's too smart.</font>

1509
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:39,751
<font color="#c0c0c0">She became Sania but forgot
to close Gullu's facebook account.</font>

1510
01:33:40,250 --> 01:33:41,251
<font color="#c0c0c0">Damn...</font>

1511
01:33:43,052 --> 01:33:44,122
<font color="#c0c0c0">Where will I find this witch?</font>

1512
01:33:44,420 --> 01:33:45,228
<font color="#c0c0c0">Hyderabad.</font>

1513
01:34:06,709 --> 01:34:08,211
<font color="#c0c0c0">Is Mr. Abdul Qadir at home?</font>

1514
01:34:08,444 --> 01:34:09,718
<font color="#c0c0c0">Babu uncle?</font>

1515
01:34:10,013 --> 01:34:11,014
<font color="#c0c0c0">Gulrez Qadir?</font>

1516
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:12,181
<font color="#c0c0c0">Yes, come come.</font>

1517
01:34:14,417 --> 01:34:15,225
<font color="#c0c0c0">Please sit.</font>

1518
01:34:15,919 --> 01:34:17,421
<font color="#c0c0c0">I can't see your father?</font>

1519
01:34:18,087 --> 01:34:20,033
<font color="#c0c0c0">He's gone for some important work.</font>

1520
01:34:22,859 --> 01:34:24,065
<font color="#c0c0c0">What do you want?</font>

1521
01:34:25,895 --> 01:34:28,205
<font color="#c0c0c0">Suppose I have one rupee
as black money.</font>

1522
01:34:28,731 --> 01:34:31,940
<font color="#c0c0c0">How do I exchange it into white?</font>

1523
01:34:32,235 --> 01:34:34,112
<font color="#c0c0c0">How, is our problem.</font>

1524
01:34:34,404 --> 01:34:35,974
<font color="#c0c0c0">All you need to
understand is that...</font>

1525
01:34:36,072 --> 01:34:38,348
<font color="#c0c0c0">...you will give me
one rupee in cash,</font>

1526
01:34:38,608 --> 01:34:41,282
<font color="#c0c0c0">...and in exchange we will deposit
eighty paise in your bank...</font>

1527
01:34:41,377 --> 01:34:42,913
<font color="#c0c0c0">...as white money.</font>

1528
01:34:43,079 --> 01:34:43,887
<font color="#c0c0c0">That's it.</font>

1529
01:34:44,113 --> 01:34:45,490
<font color="#c0c0c0">Why only eighty?</font>

1530
01:34:45,949 --> 01:34:49,294
<font color="#c0c0c0">Twenty paise is our fees,
for turning black into white.</font>

1531
01:34:49,485 --> 01:34:51,931
<font color="#c0c0c0">Okay...will it be transferred
by tomorrow?</font>

1532
01:34:52,088 --> 01:34:53,931
<font color="#c0c0c0">Soon as you give the cash,
the transfer will be done.</font>

1533
01:34:54,057 --> 01:34:56,628
<font color="#c0c0c0">No, first you transfer,
then I will give the cash.</font>

1534
01:34:56,893 --> 01:34:59,567
<font color="#c0c0c0">No dear, this business
doesn't work like that.</font>

1535
01:35:00,863 --> 01:35:04,003
<font color="#c0c0c0">Ok, then I don't want to do it.
Khuda Hafiz.</font>

1536
01:35:05,768 --> 01:35:06,678
<font color="#c0c0c0">How much is it?</font>

1537
01:35:07,937 --> 01:35:08,972
<font color="#c0c0c0">Eighty lakhs cash.</font>

1538
01:35:09,138 --> 01:35:11,675
<font color="#c0c0c0">Hmmm... You called me uncle...</font>

1539
01:35:12,375 --> 01:35:15,015
<font color="#c0c0c0">...your father is a respected
man in the neighbourhood.</font>

1540
01:35:15,612 --> 01:35:17,956
<font color="#c0c0c0">Ok, your work will be done.</font>

1541
01:35:18,114 --> 01:35:19,024
<font color="#c0c0c0">Had a lot of fun?</font>

1542
01:35:20,216 --> 01:35:20,956
<font color="#c0c0c0">You cheat!</font>

1543
01:35:22,118 --> 01:35:25,588
<font color="#c0c0c0">But within half an hour
of the money being transferred...</font>

1544
01:35:25,922 --> 01:35:27,697
<font color="#c0c0c0">...my man will be here
to collect the cash</font>

1545
01:35:27,924 --> 01:35:31,804
<font color="#c0c0c0">Think carefully, because once
the money is deposited in your bank...</font>

1546
01:35:32,161 --> 01:35:34,801
<font color="#c0c0c0">...the white money is yours
and the cash is ours.</font>

1547
01:35:35,131 --> 01:35:37,236
<font color="#c0c0c0">You will have to give
the entire amount.</font>

1548
01:35:41,304 --> 01:35:42,112
<font color="#c0c0c0">I've thought about it...</font>

1549
01:35:42,605 --> 01:35:44,414
<font color="#c0c0c0">...transfer it as soon as possible.</font>

1550
01:35:44,641 --> 01:35:46,279
<font color="#c0c0c0">- Khuda Hafiz!
- Khuda Hafiz!</font>

1551
01:35:59,088 --> 01:36:01,466
<font color="#c0c0c0">Taru bhai, there are
twenty six malls in Hyderabad...</font>

1552
01:36:01,791 --> 01:36:04,772
<font color="#c0c0c0">...if we're lucky we will
find her in the first one.</font>

1553
01:36:05,895 --> 01:36:07,602
<font color="#c0c0c0">My darned luck has
become a witch too!</font>

1554
01:36:10,066 --> 01:36:12,808
<font color="#c0c0c0">Taru, I could only get tickets
for tomorrow morning.</font>

1555
01:36:12,969 --> 01:36:14,471
<font color="#c0c0c0">I only have thirty bullets,
will that be enough?</font>

1556
01:36:14,637 --> 01:36:16,412
<font color="#c0c0c0">- Have you gone mad?
- Why, won't be enough?</font>

1557
01:36:16,572 --> 01:36:17,676
<font color="#c0c0c0">You're not taking a gun.</font>

1558
01:36:17,907 --> 01:36:20,786
<font color="#c0c0c0">We will have to take the gun,
who knows how big is her gang?</font>

1559
01:36:21,477 --> 01:36:23,286
<font color="#c0c0c0">Yes, but you can't take it
on a flight.</font>

1560
01:36:23,946 --> 01:36:24,947
<font color="#c0c0c0">It's licensed.</font>

1561
01:36:25,314 --> 01:36:26,452
<font color="#c0c0c0">Put it back.</font>

1562
01:36:49,872 --> 01:36:52,443
<font color="#c0c0c0">O the black magic woman,</font>

1563
01:36:55,578 --> 01:36:58,184
<font color="#c0c0c0">How she spun a web around me!</font>

1564
01:37:25,575 --> 01:37:26,952
<font color="#c0c0c0">She's not a cup of tea,</font>

1565
01:37:27,009 --> 01:37:28,454
<font color="#c0c0c0">Nor a cup of wine.</font>

1566
01:37:34,083 --> 01:37:35,460
<font color="#c0c0c0">She's not a silver bell,</font>

1567
01:37:35,518 --> 01:37:36,929
<font color="#c0c0c0">Nor an aching sore.</font>

1568
01:37:39,388 --> 01:37:40,765
<font color="#c0c0c0">She's made of flowers,</font>

1569
01:37:40,890 --> 01:37:42,028
<font color="#c0c0c0">But whips so hard.</font>

1570
01:37:42,225 --> 01:37:43,465
<font color="#c0c0c0">She's so delicate,</font>

1571
01:37:43,593 --> 01:37:44,901
<font color="#c0c0c0">But scrores over brawn.</font>

1572
01:37:45,895 --> 01:37:49,468
<font color="#c0c0c0">The hard hitters just look on...</font>

1573
01:37:49,899 --> 01:37:52,539
<font color="#c0c0c0">Hail the fire-cracker,</font>

1574
01:37:52,735 --> 01:37:54,908

1575
01:37:55,571 --> 01:37:58,211
<font color="#c0c0c0">Hail the thunder maker,</font>

1576
01:37:58,407 --> 01:38:00,478

<font color="#c0c0c0">Haizel Naidu,
Rajshekhar Raju,</font>

for your turn.</font>

1583

I loved you a whole lot...</font>

<font color="#c0c0c0">I will have to go myself...to return
the money... To say sorry.</font>

let's go for the interview...</font>

is so dangerous.</font>

They torture you...</font>

don't even give you water...</font>

so fearless, just like your mother.</font>

1621

<font color="#c0c0c0">Hey, not with the can...</font>

1760
01:47:13,595 --> 01:47:15,472
<font color="#c0c0c0">Hey wrestler...let go of my boys...</font>

1761
01:47:15,597 --> 01:47:16,200
<font color="#c0c0c0">Hey...</font>

1762
01:47:24,139 --> 01:47:26,415
<font color="#c0c0c0">Ungrateful girl, you're hitting me?</font>

1763
01:47:26,475 --> 01:47:27,476
<font color="#c0c0c0">Sorry... sorry</font>

1764
01:47:32,081 --> 01:47:32,889
<font color="#c0c0c0"><i>Tarn...</i></font>

1765
01:47:35,217 --> 01:47:35,957
<font color="#c0c0c0"><i>Tarn... Tarn...</i></font>

1766
01:47:41,590 --> 01:47:42,660
<font color="#c0c0c0">Enough of your drama...</font>

1767
01:47:42,958 --> 01:47:44,596
<font color="#c0c0c0">...return my money...</font>

1768
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:46,605
<font color="#c0c0c0">Don't come forward you bully...</font>

1769
01:47:46,829 --> 01:47:48,240
<font color="#c0c0c0">Just stop there...
Give my money...</font>

1770
01:47:48,330 --> 01:47:50,901
<font color="#c0c0c0">- The police is here Babu bhai!
- Who invited these pests?</font>

1771
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:54,403
<font color="#c0c0c0">Please give my money,
please give it.</font>

1772
01:47:54,470 --> 01:47:56,643
<font color="#c0c0c0">Uncle, I gave you the cheque.
You will get the entire amount.</font>

1773
01:47:56,772 --> 01:47:58,945
<font color="#c0c0c0">- Come on, run!
- Will I make a curry of the cheque?</font>

1774
01:47:59,108 --> 01:48:00,746
<font color="#c0c0c0">I will suffer a huge loss my girl...</font>

1775
01:48:00,843 --> 01:48:02,720
<font color="#c0c0c0">Damn the money Babu bhai
let's get out of here...now!</font>

1776
01:48:02,778 --> 01:48:03,722
<font color="#c0c0c0">Run...run...</font>

1777
01:48:03,779 --> 01:48:06,089
<font color="#c0c0c0">Hey... My money... My money...</font>

1778
01:48:06,915 --> 01:48:08,622
<font color="#c0c0c0">- Give me the bag...
- Here, take your money...</font>

1779
01:48:09,084 --> 01:48:12,463
<font color="#c0c0c0">Leave me alone...and never
call me a cheat again!</font>

1780
01:48:14,123 --> 01:48:16,399
<font color="#c0c0c0">Since the time I've come
you haven't shut up for a second...</font>

1781
01:48:17,659 --> 01:48:19,935
<font color="#c0c0c0">Wherever I go, I hear
you calling me a cheat.</font>

1782
01:48:20,095 --> 01:48:21,096
<font color="#c0c0c0">Yes I cheated you!</font>

1783
01:48:21,797 --> 01:48:24,209
<font color="#c0c0c0">All my life I have faced
dowry seeking boys...</font>

1784
01:48:24,266 --> 01:48:26,212
<font color="#c0c0c0">...who have insulted me and Booji</font>

1785
01:48:27,669 --> 01:48:28,511
<font color="#c0c0c0">I'm a topper.</font>

1786
01:48:29,004 --> 01:48:31,314
<font color="#c0c0c0">But there's no value of my mind.</font>

1787
01:48:32,141 --> 01:48:35,122
<font color="#c0c0c0">They hear fifteen lakhs
dowry and reject me</font>

1788
01:48:36,879 --> 01:48:38,517
<font color="#c0c0c0">You know how many times
I've been rejected?</font>

1789
01:48:39,948 --> 01:48:41,689
<font color="#c0c0c0">I couldn't bear
the insult anymore...</font>

1790
01:48:42,384 --> 01:48:44,921
<font color="#c0c0c0">...that's why I decided
never to marry.</font>

1791
01:48:45,354 --> 01:48:47,265
<font color="#c0c0c0">I don't want any man in my life.</font>

1792
01:48:48,390 --> 01:48:50,927
<font color="#c0c0c0">I made this plan
to fulfill my dreams.</font>

1793
01:48:51,827 --> 01:48:54,364
<font color="#c0c0c0">But you ruined the entire plan.</font>

1794
01:48:55,431 --> 01:48:56,375
<font color="#c0c0c0">What was the need...</font>

1795
01:48:56,532 --> 01:48:59,035
<font color="#c0c0c0">...to make this relationship for the
value of my laughter, my beauty...</font>

1796
01:48:59,101 --> 01:49:00,910
<font color="#c0c0c0">...my mind, my friendship?</font>

1797
01:49:01,837 --> 01:49:03,111
<font color="#c0c0c0">Why are you so strange?</font>

1798
01:49:04,406 --> 01:49:07,910
<font color="#c0c0c0">You never went to college,
you speak in broken English.</font>

1799
01:49:08,410 --> 01:49:11,914
<font color="#c0c0c0">You eat paan, you burp,
you wear horrible shins...</font>

1800
01:49:15,484 --> 01:49:17,930
<font color="#c0c0c0">...but yet I started liking you
for your sweetness.</font>

1801
01:49:21,590 --> 01:49:23,592
<font color="#c0c0c0">I couldn't hurt you
and go to America.</font>

1802
01:49:23,892 --> 01:49:25,667
<font color="#c0c0c0">That's why I was coming
to return your money.</font>

1803
01:49:26,195 --> 01:49:27,674
<font color="#c0c0c0">It's eighty lakhs. You can count...</font>

1804
01:49:29,198 --> 01:49:30,973
<font color="#c0c0c0">Hey Taru, here...</font>

1805
01:49:31,867 --> 01:49:32,436
<font color="#c0c0c0">Hey!</font>

1806
01:49:32,968 --> 01:49:34,675
<font color="#c0c0c0">Well done Taru, you caught the girl.</font>

1807
01:49:35,137 --> 01:49:36,013
<font color="#c0c0c0">Look what I caught?</font>

1808
01:49:36,104 --> 01:49:37,777
<font color="#c0c0c0">Leave him... Leave him...</font>

1809
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:39,411
<font color="#c0c0c0">Excuse me.</font>

1810
01:49:40,742 --> 01:49:41,982
<font color="#c0c0c0">What do you mean
'see what I caught'?</font>

1811
01:49:42,244 --> 01:49:43,848
<font color="#c0c0c0">He's my father, not a thief.</font>

1812
01:49:44,513 --> 01:49:46,220
<font color="#c0c0c0">Taru, whatever happened,
it was my doing...</font>

1813
01:49:46,315 --> 01:49:48,886
<font color="#c0c0c0">I made the whole plan,
it's not Booji's fault.</font>

1814
01:49:48,951 --> 01:49:49,827
<font color="#c0c0c0">Please let him go.</font>

1815
01:49:50,018 --> 01:49:51,691
<font color="#c0c0c0">What is this commotion?</font>

1816
01:49:51,854 --> 01:49:53,527
<font color="#c0c0c0">Very shrewd criminals they are,
both father and daughter...</font>

1817
01:49:53,822 --> 01:49:55,824
<font color="#c0c0c0">They duped my client
of eighty lakhs...</font>

1818
01:49:56,024 --> 01:49:56,866
<font color="#c0c0c0">...it's in the bag...</font>

1819
01:49:57,326 --> 01:49:58,862
<font color="#c0c0c0">Is this correct uncle?</font>

1820
01:49:59,561 --> 01:50:00,198
<font color="#c0c0c0">Yes</font>

1821
01:50:00,429 --> 01:50:01,601
<font color="#c0c0c0">Come on then, to the police station</font>

1822
01:50:01,763 --> 01:50:02,741
<font color="#c0c0c0"><i>Just wait and watch now Tarn...</i></font>

1823
01:50:02,898 --> 01:50:04,605
<font color="#c0c0c0">I will get the maximum
sentence for her...</font>

1824
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:06,436
<font color="#c0c0c0">So that all the girls of India
will learn a lesson...</font>

1825
01:50:06,602 --> 01:50:09,913
<font color="#c0c0c0">...that they shouldn't dare trick
innocent guys into 498a.</font>

1826
01:50:10,906 --> 01:50:12,579
<font color="#c0c0c0">If girls trick guys,
they are low-life...</font>

1827
01:50:13,175 --> 01:50:15,246
<font color="#c0c0c0">...but boys keep demanding dowry,
they are still considered innocent.</font>

1828
01:50:17,246 --> 01:50:17,917
<font color="#c0c0c0">No.</font>

1829
01:50:18,881 --> 01:50:19,985
<font color="#c0c0c0">You please leave... Sorry.</font>

1830
01:50:20,249 --> 01:50:21,853
<font color="#c0c0c0">Made us run for nothing...</font>

1831
01:50:22,551 --> 01:50:23,757
<font color="#c0c0c0"><i>Have you gone mad Tarn'?</i></font>

1832
01:50:29,791 --> 01:50:30,599
<font color="#c0c0c0">You come here...</font>

1833
01:50:31,426 --> 01:50:32,063
<font color="#c0c0c0">What?</font>

1834
01:50:45,874 --> 01:50:48,047
<font color="#c0c0c0">- If you want to say something...
- Will you shut up for a minute?</font>

1835
01:50:49,044 --> 01:50:50,022
<font color="#c0c0c0">Can I say something?</font>

1836
01:50:54,149 --> 01:50:55,628
<font color="#c0c0c0">I understood everything else...</font>

1837
01:50:57,319 --> 01:50:59,890
<font color="#c0c0c0">...but what did you say in
the middle of that long speech...</font>

1838
01:51:01,390 --> 01:51:03,165
<font color="#c0c0c0">...you started liking me?</font>

1839
01:51:03,859 --> 01:51:05,839
<font color="#c0c0c0">What? Yes...</font>

1840
01:51:06,728 --> 01:51:07,570
<font color="#c0c0c0">Just liking?</font>

1841
01:51:08,730 --> 01:51:10,175
<font color="#c0c0c0">I fell in love with you...</font>

1842
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:12,879
<font color="#c0c0c0">Since I've returned from Lucknow,</font>

1843
01:51:12,901 --> 01:51:15,211
<font color="#c0c0c0">I just can't forget the flavours
of your talk, of your food...</font>

1844
01:51:15,404 --> 01:51:17,975
<font color="#c0c0c0">...of the fun I had with you...</font>

1845
01:51:19,174 --> 01:51:21,176
<font color="#c0c0c0">I have gotten addicted
to your flavours.</font>

1846
01:51:24,379 --> 01:51:27,588
<font color="#c0c0c0">So the butcher has fallen
in love with the goat?</font>

1847
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:32,621
<font color="#c0c0c0">You are that good...</font>

1848
01:51:34,389 --> 01:51:36,960
<font color="#c0c0c0">Why can't all other men
be normal like you...</font>

1849
01:51:37,492 --> 01:51:38,869
<font color="#c0c0c0">Then there wouldn't be any problem.</font>

1850
01:51:39,094 --> 01:51:42,405
<font color="#c0c0c0">There would have been a big problem.</font>

1851
01:51:44,032 --> 01:51:45,170
<font color="#c0c0c0">Then you wouldn't
have come to Lucknow.</font>

1852
01:51:46,435 --> 01:51:48,312
<font color="#c0c0c0">Sania would have become
somebody else's in Hyderabad.</font>

1853
01:51:50,539 --> 01:51:51,313
<font color="#c0c0c0">Gulrez</font>

1854
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,683
<font color="#c0c0c0">Oh yes, Gulrez.</font>

1855
01:51:56,845 --> 01:51:58,085
<font color="#c0c0c0">So you have forgiven me?</font>

1856
01:51:58,714 --> 01:52:01,820
<font color="#c0c0c0">What to do, you are that good.</font>

1857
01:52:05,621 --> 01:52:08,067
<font color="#c0c0c0">You have tricked me
by feeding kheer...</font>

1858
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:14,172
<font color="#c0c0c0">...but I still want to love you
so very much.</font>

1859
01:52:17,265 --> 01:52:20,405
<font color="#c0c0c0">Gullu... You hurt me badly.</font>

1860
01:52:23,905 --> 01:52:26,909
<font color="#c0c0c0">- You won't again?
- No, no, never ever. Sorry.</font>

1861
01:52:36,718 --> 01:52:38,857
<font color="#c0c0c0">What did I do to deserve you?</font>

1862
01:52:40,188 --> 01:52:44,068
<font color="#c0c0c0">Something wonderful my dear...
that's why you got my Gullu.</font>

1863
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:48,198
<font color="#c0c0c0">Gullu-Taru, perfect couple.</font>

1864
01:52:48,897 --> 01:52:50,205
<font color="#c0c0c0">Now we will have a real wedding.</font>

1865
01:53:01,877 --> 01:53:04,721
<font color="#c0c0c0">Enough of fooling around,
shall we begin?</font>

1866
01:53:05,147 --> 01:53:06,023
<font color="#c0c0c0">Gulrez dear...</font>

1867
01:53:06,314 --> 01:53:07,054
<font color="#c0c0c0">Yes...</font>

1868
01:53:11,086 --> 01:53:15,967
<font color="#c0c0c0">Tariq Haider, I mean Taru Haider,
son of Farooq Haider.</font>

1869
01:53:16,858 --> 01:53:21,068
<font color="#c0c0c0">Do you accept me, Gulrez Qadir,
daughter of Abdul Qadir?</font>

1870
01:53:21,697 --> 01:53:23,438
<font color="#c0c0c0">You accept without
a single penny of dowry?</font>

1871
01:53:23,699 --> 01:53:25,076
<font color="#c0c0c0">Not once, a thousand times.</font>

1872
01:53:25,467 --> 01:53:26,605
<font color="#c0c0c0">Say you accept son.</font>

1873
01:53:27,903 --> 01:53:28,574
<font color="#c0c0c0">I accept...</font>

1874
01:53:29,271 --> 01:53:34,414
<font color="#c0c0c0">Do you accept me Tariq Haider,
son of Farooq Haider?</font>

1875
01:53:36,545 --> 01:53:37,455
<font color="#c0c0c0">I accept you.</font>

1876
01:53:38,747 --> 01:53:43,127
<font color="#c0c0c0">Amju! The girl's father
is ready to help us.</font>

1877
01:53:43,652 --> 01:53:44,357
<font color="#c0c0c0">Full help...</font>

1878
01:53:45,554 --> 01:53:46,294
<font color="#c0c0c0">One crore.</font>

1879
01:53:47,556 --> 01:53:49,365
<font color="#c0c0c0">Say thank you...</font>

1880
01:53:51,059 --> 01:53:54,302
<font color="#c0c0c0">Father, I'm not an item for you
to sell and him to buy.</font>

1881
01:53:54,996 --> 01:53:56,942
<font color="#c0c0c0">I don't want to go to America
with someone's help...</font>

1882
01:53:57,532 --> 01:54:00,376
<font color="#c0c0c0">So sir, thanks but no thanks.</font>

1883
01:54:01,403 --> 01:54:02,040
<font color="#c0c0c0">I'm sorry...</font>

1884
01:54:05,674 --> 01:54:06,209
<font color="#c0c0c0">Amjad!</font>

1885
01:54:07,075 --> 01:54:08,884
<font color="#c0c0c0">- Have you lost your mind?
- Yes, I have...</font>

1886
01:54:09,211 --> 01:54:10,588
<font color="#c0c0c0">I wish I had lost it sooner.</font>

1887
01:54:33,602 --> 01:54:38,108
<font color="#c0c0c0">Advertised love,
is for strangers.</font>

1888
01:54:38,774 --> 01:54:43,120
<font color="#c0c0c0">Tested love,
is for brave-hearts.</font>

1889
01:54:54,923 --> 01:54:59,633
<font color="#c0c0c0">Come let's wave the flag
of our crazy love.</font>

1890
01:54:59,995 --> 01:55:04,410
