00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:29,624
Loafers, wasters, bums,

2
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:32,892
A ghost ran away with your underpants...
get under a blanket and hide

3
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:35,999
Loafers, wasters, bums,

4
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:39,559
A ghost ran away with your underpants...
get under a blanket and hide

5
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:47,583
fuk fuk fuk fuk

6
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,976
Booze, weed, grass just one hit

7
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,249
Out comes the smoke
and all the trouble are gone

8
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:02,559
Kneel before God, ring the temple bell

9
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,934
1, 2, 3, 4, I want kisses over and over

10
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:09,249
5, 6, 7, 8, at night well go to lndia Gate

11
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:12,374
Loafers, wasters, bums,

A ghost ran away with your underpants...

fuk fuk fuk fuk

16
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,457
We stay on the other side of the Jamuna,

17
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,124
We love all women

18
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,809
The girl is proud, we have no money,

19
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,457
Ask for a loan, get powerless

20
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,101
if we make money, we will catch the prey,

21
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,767
Spray some deo on your shirt

22
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,231
The good for nothing troupe is ready

23
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,082
The penniless ones are here

24
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,726
We have worn a pant

25
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,374
While the other is being washed by mummy

26
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,684
Loafers, wasters, bums,

27
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,934
A ghost ran away with your underpants...

00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:13,708
fuk fuk fuk fuk

31
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:24,957
Let there be a country of loafers
and make me the President.

32
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,767
Sing with me now, brothers and sisters.

33
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:32,082
1,2,3,4, Long live the Loafers Party!!

34
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,392
5, 6, 7, 8, Death to all the smarty pants

35
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,476
Loafers, wasters, bums,

36
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,332
A ghost ran away with your underpants

37
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:46,832
Loafers, O Loafers,
your luck is so messed up

38
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:52,999
Even your shoes are in tatters

39
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,582
Your luck is so messed up.

40
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,749
My father says...

41
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,332
'son, you hold your destiny
in your own hands.'

42
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:14,290
But if I go by his words,
which I seldom do, then by God...

43
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,332
my destiny is fast asleep!

44
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,249
Do colleges also have morning assembly?

45
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,207
No man.

46
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,832
Only school teachers are obsessed
with morning assembly and uniforms.

47
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,082
College is all about scoring girls.

48
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,207
You're right man.

49
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,226
In government schools,
it's guys chasing guys!

50
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,874
You know Amit from the 12th grade?

51
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:47,309
Yeah.

52
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,614
He was in the toilet yesterday
with Rahul during assembly.

53
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,540
Are you serious?

54
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,457
Of course!

55
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,851
We'll walk hand in hand,
we'll walk hand in hand,

56
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:02,124
We'll walk hand in hand someday;

57
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,601
Dude, we can easilyjump over this wall.

58
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,332
Why break our backs over this stupid hole?

59
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,059
Choocha!

60
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,540
We have only a couple
of days of school to leave our mark behind.

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,267
That's all we've been doing
for the past two years.

62
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,082
Trust me, this year we will graduate!

63
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,125
I swear on your mother!

64
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,290
Dude, is it difficult to bunk
lectures in college?

65
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,707
No man.

66
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,124
You can do anything you want.

67
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,267
Study if you want to,
otherwise forget it.

68
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,957
Lounge in the canteen, hang around...

69
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,101
take in the scent of beautiful girls...

70
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,309
try and score with them...

71
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,434
kiss them anytime, anywhere...

72
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,934
no one bothers.

73
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,540
Sounds exciting!

74
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,415
Dude we're going
to college together!

75
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,976
I'll become someone's boyfriend
on the very first day.

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,665
Hello May Day...

77
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,892
Attention... the wall is about
to be breached!

78
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:56,916
Fire!

79
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,184
Dear god, you are the almighty.

80
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,499
You know everything there is to know...

81
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,624
but I'd like to remind you once again.

82
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:23,767
Please get me migrated into
Shalu's college this year.

83
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,851
It didn't happen last year, but this year
please make it happen.

84
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,101
I will offer prayers daily.

85
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,582
Please, God.

86
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,559
Bishop College.

87
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,332
Just reminding you since there are
so many colleges.

88
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,490
Bachelor of Commerce, 2nd year.

89
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,332
Give him your exam roll number as well.

90
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:17,583
Sir...

91
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,832
there was a cooking gas cylinder
along with these milk cans...

92
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:21,875
now its gone.

93
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,082
Did you see anyone take it?

94
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,165
No, brother, I don't drink milk.

95
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:40,892
In college, the girls will be...

96
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,749
Shut up, Choocha!

97
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,017
Stop sucking up.

98
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,267
Or I won't go with you.

99
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,457
Sorry bro.

100
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,642
Just that I'm really excited.

101
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,184
We'll sort you out,
but for now, be quiet.

102
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:51,832
Okay...

103
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,915
I am sure it will be fun.

104
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,499
Stop...

105
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,832
look...

106
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:48,915
Sardarji, want to buy a gas cylinder?

107
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,040
Half price!

108
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,499
What are you staring at?

109
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,999
I found it on the street.

110
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,332
Cylinder?

111
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:02,892
Yeah.

112
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:03,665
You found it?

113
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:04,290
Yeah.

114
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,082
On the street?

115
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:05,809
Yeah.

116
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,040
I'll beat the crap out of you.

117
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,559
You bloody dope head...

118
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,684
selling my own cylinder back to me?!

119
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,332
Whoa... I'm not a thief.

120
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,249
I found it on the street.

121
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,309
How does it belong to you?

122
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,999
I'll tell you!

123
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,684
Okay... fine...

124
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:22,809
you can keep it.

125
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,374
As a gift.

126
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,624
I am very rich anyway.

127
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,665
All my money's gathering dust...

128
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:34,832
Just leave.

129
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,457
Sardarji...

130
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,707
how about a plate of chole-bhatura?

131
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,915
Can't you hear my stomach growl?

132
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:02,916
Chotu...

133
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,457
give him a serving of chole-bhatura.

134
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,749
Here you go.

135
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,892
Dumbass, can't you serve properly?

136
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,582
You think I'm a homeless beggar?

137
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,040
What the...

138
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:18,767
You think this is your father's wedding
reception to feed him for free?

139
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,540
Why don't you slice me up
and add me to his dish?

140
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,499
You think this is a soup kitchen?

141
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Hello?

142
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,874
In five minutes.

143
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,124
I'll be there.

144
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,290
Now he's got angels falling for him
where are you off to?

145
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,892
Dad, that was Raju.
He's clearing our dues today.

146
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,332
Did Raju rob a bank last night...

147
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,684
that he wants to clear our dues?

148
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:42,809
You think I'm an idiot?

149
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,749
He really called me,
I'll see you later.

150
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:50,915
What a bad start to the day.
I can't even set my beard!

151
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:19,415
10 more seconds and
I'd have taken the bus.

152
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,559
have I ever been late?

153
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,165
You know what my dad's like.

154
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,249
He can't set his beard unless
he yells at me every morning.

155
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,124
How was the movie yesterday?

156
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,582
It was okay.

157
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,290
You never take me along
with your college friends.

158
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,684
I'm in college too.

159
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:42,207
You aren't in college,
you're studying through correspondence.

160
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,165
It's the same thing.

161
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,934
Anyway, I'm coming to
your college next year.

162
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,165
So hang with us next year then.

163
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,665
You've become very rude lately.

164
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,540
Never mind.

165
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,249
You'll show me around
your college today?

166
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:03,124
I've been asking you for so long.
Say something.

167
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Fine!

168
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,374
Only if Pandit lets us go.

169
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:08,708
Who is Pandit?

170
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,624
What's up, Panditji?

171
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,374
Nothing new...

172
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:19,165
it's the same grind everyday.

173
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,809
I'm stuck in his shithole
for other reasons

174
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,665
or I would've quit this job long ago.

175
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,957
You see this room?

176
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:33,832
Back home the bull knocks up cows
in a room bigger than this.

177
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,476
You're right, Panditji.

178
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,940
My dad said the same thing
to my mom.

179
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,082
Anyway, tell me something...

180
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,101
how much do we have to score
to make it to college?

181
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,665
At least, 85 %

182
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,165
You must be kidding!

183
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,976
You are kidding yourself
to even think about college.

184
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,540
All year round you make
life hell for others.

185
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,332
Now it's your turn to feel the heat.

186
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,957
There is another way in...

187
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,976
if you want, I can pull some strings.

188
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,665
Panditji, any way will do.

189
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,767
We'll tear through the roof,
if necessary.

190
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,540
Tell us what you can do.

191
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,790
Exam papers for the 12th grade are out.

192
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,934
What do you mean out?

193
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,415
Out, Choocha, out!

194
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,915
When he says they're out,
he means they've been leaked.

195
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,809
Holy shit Panditji!

196
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,332
Please do something for us.

197
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,976
Consider it done.

198
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,892
Come here a day before every exam.

199
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,624
50,000 rupees
for every exam paper.

200
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,082
Fifty?!!

201
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,415
That's too much!

202
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,249
I'm charging others 60,000.

203
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,434
This is a discount for you.

204
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,832
Why? Do you fancy us, or what?

205
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,540
He's so vulgar!

206
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,583
Shut up!

207
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,517
Panditji, you'll give us
the real papers right?

208
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,517
My papers will have better
printing than the real ones.

209
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,601
Get the money in place.

210
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,124
You only have a week.

211
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,707
Seven days only.

212
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:03,625
Get it?

213
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,976
Panditji, can we
walk around the college once?

214
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,665
I really want to go inside.

215
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,582
Never seen one.

216
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,457
Please don't say no.

217
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,124
Please, Panditji.

218
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,934
Come on Sunday
and I'll give you a tour!

219
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,226
Why? You want us to come and hang around
with the gardener's daughter?

220
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,434
Five minutes is all we want...

221
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,726
we'll be out in two!

222
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,892
Try to understand
you can't go in!

223
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:20,916
Panditji...

224
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,416
can he go in with me?

225
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,499
He's only going to drop me off, please.

226
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,416
Take.

227
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,226
Panditji, how could you let him in?
Even he doesn't study here...

228
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,457
But his girlfriend does.

229
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,707
Huh! She's not his girlfriend.

230
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,040
I've seen her with Monty
a lot of times.

231
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,059
Really? Monty?

232
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:45,601
Yeah.

233
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,749
You mean, cheating?

234
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,125
Shut it Choocha.

235
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,207
Panditji, please let us go in
or he won't stop until Sunday.

236
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:53,833
Please.

237
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,309
Okay, okay...

238
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,892
Listen, if anyone asks,
say that you are Zafar's cousins.

239
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,415
Is Zafar the big bully here?

240
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,457
Not a bull, but a cow.

241
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,749
He was the cool dude some years ago,
but is lying low now.

242
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,601
I pull strings for
people all the time...

243
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,790
but Zafar once pulled strings for me.

244
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:37,374
A star shines in my soul

245
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:44,040
And shows me the path

246
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:50,457
Shows me grace in an unfinished note

247
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:57,957
And

248
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,540
Lord, I can't take it anymore

249
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,374
Say something

250
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,165
Lord, open the doors of destiny

251
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:18,040
Please open them

252
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,851
Lord, I can't take it anymore

253
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,665
Say something

254
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,457
Lord, open the doors of destiny

255
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,332
Please open them

256
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,040
All my dreams

257
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,332
Are shut in a box

258
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:40,457
Lord, make a hole in that box

259
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,415
Lord, I can't take it anymore

260
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,290
Say something

261
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,082
Lord, open the doors of destiny

262
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,957
Please open them

263
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,124
Dreams are bubbling in my eyes

264
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,165
They speak to me every day

265
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,499
Dreams are bubbling in my eyes

266
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:29,165
They speak to me every day

267
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,165
They are in my eyes, in all I say

268
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,957
Yet so far from my reach

269
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,165
I've lost all patience

270
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,249
Give me some mantra

271
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:47,957
I've been vying for your
attention for so long

272
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,207
Lord, I can't take it anymore

273
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,040
Say something

274
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,892
Lord, open the doors of destiny

275
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,582
Please open them

276
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,540
Lord, I can't take it anymore

277
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,332
Say something

278
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,165
Lord, open the doors of destiny

279
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,915
Please open them

280
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:18,499
A star shines in my soul

281
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:23,290
And shows me the path

282
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:28,434
Shows me grace in an unfinished note

283
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:32,374
Let the tune be completed

284
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,249
A rhythm is at play

285
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,392
And melody flows

286
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:42,249
This continues

287
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:47,290
Sometimes with words, sometimes without

288
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:52,874
Our conversations, continue

289
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:58,874
A star shines in my soul

290
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,624
Dude!

291
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,976
You play the Violin just like
Shahrukh does in his films.

292
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,976
Fantastic!

293
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,976
There you go again making
a jerk of yourself!

294
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,749
It's a guitar, not a Violin!

295
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:16,665
Right?

296
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:20,040
Hunny, stop embarrassing me
in front of strangers, okay?

297
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,434
Whatever it is,
you are really good.

298
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,082
What course are you in?

299
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,976
I don't study here.

300
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,915
Oh, so you teach music?

301
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,874
Like Shahrukh Khan from
'Mohabbatein'?

302
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:31,892
Hey!

303
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:35,499
He doesn't teach here
and you don't study here.

304
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,559
Aren't your five minutes up yet?

305
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,976
We were just leaving, relax.

306
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,457
Before we leave,
won't you introduce us to Zafar?

307
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,415
Let's see what breed your cow is.

308
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:50,249
That's like asking if the sun is out
on a hot, sunny afternoon.

309
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,124
You are standing in his presence.

310
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,142
Him?

311
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,415
That's amazing, Panditji.

312
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,642
I've decided that as soon as we get
admission, I'm taking up the guitar.

313
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,851
Hunny, girls are crazy for guitarists!

314
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,582
Chicks will stick to you like magnets if
you've got a guitar.

315
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,499
Hey... time is up!

316
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,415
You better get the money in time.

317
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,976
You're top breed, for sure, brother!

318
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,040
Seven days only, get it?

319
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,915
So, Mr. Rockstar...

320
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,874
do you intend wasting your
talent over here?

321
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,999
When will you hit the big time?

322
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:28,207
Huh?

323
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,541
Album?

324
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,707
I'm asking because I'm worried about you.

325
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,809
I've known you for six years.

326
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,707
You rocked this place for the first three.

327
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,957
The other three I still don't understand.

328
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,517
Anything clicked yet?

329
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,415
No, Panditji.

330
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,726
They know my face so well at all the
auditions and reality shows...

331
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,470
they don't even let me in through the gate.

332
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,957
As for recording an album,
that's another ballgame altogether.

333
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:53,892
How could that be?

334
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,249
I mean, here you play so well.

335
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,726
I get your music, they don't?

336
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,082
It's not their fault.

337
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,499
These strings are tied to someone else.

338
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,665
When that person is away,
the music also goes away.

339
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,333
Touching.

340
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,915
I get what you're saying.

341
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,457
Keep playing.

342
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,374
If you need any help, let me know.

343
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,915
This is my new Visiting card.

344
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:18,541
Look...

345
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,374
it has my picture too.

346
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:22,791
What do you think?

347
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,415
Good.

348
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,874
Carry on... see you later.

349
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,415
Dude, I have a dream.

350
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,809
On our first day of college...

351
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,540
we will enter on horses.

352
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,559
You riding the white horse...

353
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,892
and I on the black...

354
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:48,082
wearing black sunglasses,
long leather boots with zippers...

355
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,559
red shirts and black pants.

356
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,665
Shirts buttoned up to the collar.

357
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:56,165
Dude, girls will kill for us.

358
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,874
That reminds me...

359
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:02,658
I forgot to tell you
about the dream I had this morning!

360
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:04,124
You jerk!

361
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,809
All you've done is talk nonsense all day...

362
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,184
missing out on what's really important.

363
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:09,226
As it is,
you've had a dream after bloody ages.

364
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,392
Sorry, dude.

365
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:13,726
The thing is I dream every night,
but sometimes I forget.

366
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,750
So anyway...

367
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:18,207
I saw, you were at the Jumbo Circus.

368
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:23,476
And a jumbo,
I mean an elephant goes wild...

369
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,892
and instead of playing with a colourful
ball, it takes you in its trunk...

370
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,832
and starts banging you on the floor.

371
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:32,934
That's when I get there
and rescue you from its trunk.

372
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:36,832
Then I wrap the trunk around my hand
and whack it with one blow.

373
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:37,875
Knock-out!

374
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,517
You bloody scoundrel...

375
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:45,809
elephants banging me on the floor,
horses dragging me...

376
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,892
next it'll be a donkey kicking me...

377
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:51,332
Smart ass, a little puppy
scares you to bits...

378
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,124
and you think you can whack an elephant!

379
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,166
Knock-out?!

380
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,684
Dude, you can't control what you
see in a dream.

381
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:57,934
A dream is a dream.

382
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,040
Anything is possible.

383
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:00,476
Anything is possible!

384
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,040
Shut up now!
Let me figure it out.

385
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:07,374
Mad elephant... elephant...

386
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,540
elephant as in Ganpati.

387
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,934
As in?

388
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:12,124
Lord Ganesha!

389
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,540
Lord Ganesha?

390
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,976
Bloody Englishman!

391
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,790
Indian Gods are so colourful!

392
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,165
Dude, don't confuse.

393
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,226
That was Lord Hanuman,
this is Lord Ganesha.

394
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,874
Hang on to Lord Ganesha.

395
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,415
Lord Ganesha...

396
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:31,332
also known as Shri Ganesh.

397
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:33,374
And 'a whack with the hand'...

398
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,499
a hand has five fingers...

399
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,915
five!

400
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:40,749
So it's number five on Shri Ganesh.

401
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:42,333
Let's go.

402
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,082
Here they come again.

403
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:09,832
A hundred tickets for Shri Ganesh,
number four.

404
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:17,040
Shri Ganesh... number four...

405
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:19,124
Do you have number four?

406
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,375
No.

407
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:27,582
Sorry, we're out of four.

408
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:32,582
In that case,
we'll go with number eight.

409
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:36,540
Number eight...

410
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:37,915
Do you have number eight?

411
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,124
No, out of eight too.

412
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,625
Really?

413
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:48,332
What do we do, Choocha?

414
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:50,040
Let's take number three.

415
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:50,892
Three?

416
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,582
No, I think we should go
with number five.

417
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:54,499
Screw what you think, let's go for three.

418
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:55,642
I don't get you...

419
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:56,684
Don't argue.

420
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:57,332
I want number three.

421
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:58,434
Oh no, number five.

422
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,767
Dude, shut up!
Why don't you get it?

423
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:01,934
Tell me, do you have number five?

424
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:03,540
This is not fair, Hunny.

425
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,290
Hey! I asked for number five,
not your daughter's hand in marriage.

426
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:14,165
Hurry up, it's almost time for the draw.

427
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:40,207
Scoundrels!

428
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,832
Pulled a fast one again!

429
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,226
Cut, cut...

430
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,250
Sorry.

431
00:26:57,541 --> 00:26:58,517
Lucky 13...

432
00:26:58,541 --> 00:27:01,082
Sir, sir...
the talkback is off...

433
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:04,708
Start!

434
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,207
What's wrong?

435
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:11,684
Even pirated CDs don't
get stuck like you do.

436
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:13,892
We've done 13 takes.

437
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:14,999
Lucky 13!

438
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:18,207
Get back in tune
and start singing.

439
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,250
Come on, start...

440
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,957
Sir, I can't do it.

441
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,082
Sir, I'm unable to sing.

442
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:25,934
Let's pack up for today.

443
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:26,958
Pack up?

444
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:29,351
If you're calling the shots here,
what do you want me for?

445
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:31,249
You think, I'm here for your autograph?

446
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:33,976
If you can't sing, get lost.

447
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,082
Out!

448
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:39,476
Call the percussionists in.
Let's see what they can do.

449
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,976
Listen Mr. Rockstar,
if you continue to sing like this...

450
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,249
very soon you'll be sporting wrinkles,
but your album won't see the light of day.

451
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,040
Now get lost!

452
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,750
Sir...

453
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:14,666
Yes?

454
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:18,934
Did you see anyone steal
my motorcycle tyre?

455
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:20,749
No brother, I'm not married.

456
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:46,874
You dopehead!

457
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:51,749
Stop right there!

458
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:34,375
Lali...

459
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:50,332
Although it's none of my business,
I'd like to tell you something.

460
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,874
Look I know you're hurt but...

461
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,624
it's not necessary that your school friends
remain friends in college too.

462
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:58,332
A lot changes when
you are in college.

463
00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:00,559
You start a whole new life.

464
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:06,124
Ma'am, that doesn't mean you
give up on old friends for new.

465
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:07,559
No, not at all.

466
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:10,249
Friendship doesn't end
but priorities change.

467
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:13,665
Sometimes, a person's tastes also change...

468
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:17,999
I hope you understand
what I'm trying to say.

469
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:19,915
Take care.

470
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:51,749
Excuse me, ma'am!

471
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:53,892
I meant her.

472
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:56,290
Ma'am, don't you teach at BCMC?

473
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:56,832
Yes.

474
00:30:57,291 --> 00:30:59,874
Ma'am, I want to transfer
to your college next year?

475
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:01,708
Good luck.

476
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:06,915
Sure, but what I mean is...
if you could teach me...

477
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:08,791
Me?

478
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:10,351
Take tuition classes.

479
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:13,207
I tried but all batches are full.

480
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,124
Moreover most of the syllabus
is completed.

481
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,767
So, how can I help?

482
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:19,332
Ma'am, don't you teach accountancy?

483
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:20,082
Yes.

484
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:22,457
I heard from Shalu.

485
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,249
Ma'am, I find accountancy tough.

486
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:25,517
I can't figure it out...

487
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:27,915
whereas, I've studied
all the other subjects.

488
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:31,166
Sorry, ma'am.

489
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,040
Ma'am, please ma'am.

490
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:34,559
Accountancy is very difficult.

491
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:36,624
Look, don't get me wrong.

492
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:40,165
I know why you are doing this...
don't rush into it.

493
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:42,309
No, ma'am, I'm not rushing.

494
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,333
Please, ma'am.

495
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:50,666
Alright...

496
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:54,207
we'll begin this evening,
at my place.

497
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:57,476
Will you manage?

498
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,165
Yes, ma'am, no problem.

499
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,375
Thank you, ma'am.

500
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,207
Listen, think about what
I was trying to tell you earlier.

501
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,332
It will help you.

502
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:08,791
See you.

503
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:13,916
I've thought about it...

504
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,665
I have a point to make.

505
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:22,207
When I go out with another girl
in the same college...

506
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:25,332
that's when she'll realise.

507
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,332
Today is your last day in school.

508
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:39,976
Your board exams begin in five days...

509
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,457
and today you'll get your
roll numbers.

510
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:48,582
Only those students whose attendance is
more than 75% will get their roll numbers.

511
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:53,415
There are two dimwits who won't get them.

512
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,832
Stand up as I call out your names.

513
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,207
Dalip Singh and Vikas Gulati.

514
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,540
Wow.

515
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:07,517
Standing up even before
your names are called.

516
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:08,582
Excellent!

517
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:11,665
Sumit, take this...

518
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:14,915
and distribute these roll numbers outside.

519
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:16,874
You two... come here.

520
00:33:24,541 --> 00:33:27,976
Scoundrels, if you weren't attending
my tuition classes...

521
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,976
I'd have never given you your roll numbers.

522
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,082
Here.

523
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:34,749
Got my tuition fees?

524
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,124
Yes sir.

525
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:37,999
Put it here and get lost!

526
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:44,290
Sir, which college did you attend?

527
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:48,040
I mean, was attendance
compulsory there too?

528
00:33:49,416 --> 00:33:50,809
Let me remind you, numbskull...

529
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:54,415
this is the year you make
a hat trick of failures.

530
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:55,767
You're thinking about college and...

531
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:59,249
I'm thinking about where I will
put you in this classroom.

532
00:33:59,916 --> 00:34:01,332
Now get lost.

533
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:13,892
We shouldn't have given him the fees.

534
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:15,559
Now, how will we arrange the money
to pay for the question papers?

535
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:19,290
If we hadn't bought roll numbers off him, we
couldn't even have appeared for the exams.

536
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:22,684
And if you take that many days to come up
with a dream, how will I arrange the money?

537
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:23,499
Where is today's dream?

538
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:27,332
Dude, I dream every night but
I don't always remember it.

539
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:28,851
Remember that Hollywood film...

540
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:29,790
lnception?

541
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:31,374
The one with the 'Titanic' hero...

542
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:34,476
It was shown that they use needles
to get inside the brain.

543
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,892
Why don't you come up with
something like that?

544
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:38,436
Then you can poke some needles in me
and watch my dream with me.

545
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:41,165
It's not easy to remember my dreams.

546
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:12,957
Are you going to burn
a hole in the building?

547
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:21,833
You stroll by, to get close to me

548
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:33,375
Sometimes you look in my eyes,
sometimes you gaze at my walk

549
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:40,892
Ambarsariya, don't pick the bud unbloomed

550
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:45,976
Your mother's said the
harshest things to me

551
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Ambarsariya, ho Ambarsariya

552
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:02,392
Dude. Your confidence
frightens me sometimes.

553
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:04,249
And your own face doesn't?

554
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:07,582
You can't be bird watching here.

555
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,415
Think about the exams!

556
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,915
We have five days to pay Panditji.

557
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:13,684
Another year we'll have to rot in school.

558
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:15,082
Shut up, you jinx!

559
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,684
Can't you be happy at my progress?

560
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:18,915
Yeah right!

561
00:36:19,541 --> 00:36:22,332
Once in 1st grade,
twice in 6th grade...

562
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:24,624
and for the third bloody time in the 12th.

563
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,166
Progress!

564
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:29,207
Who fails in the 1st grade, man??

565
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:52,332
Will you be my friend?

566
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,457
If yes, then hold the kite up.

567
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:13,892
Ambarsariya, don't pick the bud unbloomed

568
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:21,916
Your mother's said the
harshest things to me

569
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:28,249
Ambarsariya

570
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:37,851
So, you want to be my friend?

571
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:40,249
If I didn't want to,
would I hold up the kite?

572
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,809
Yeah... but only friends, nothing more.

573
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:44,374
Don't ever say 'l love you' to me.

574
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:47,832
Of course not,
why would I say, 'l love you'?

575
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:50,290
You're not my girlfriend.

576
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:52,726
Anyway, I already have a girlfriend.

577
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,040
Really? What's her name?

578
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:56,415
First tell me yours.

579
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,957
Priya, now tell me her name.

580
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:03,142
Jasmine, she is in college.

581
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:04,707
She's a year older than me.

582
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:08,392
Actually, I have a thing for mature girls.

583
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,976
You get
to learn a lot from them.

584
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,499
Really? What mature things
has she taught you?

585
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,416
Well...

586
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:17,957
she taught me how to kiss.

587
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,124
What's there to teach in a kiss?

588
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:24,290
Not your regular kiss,
a mature kiss.

589
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,999
French kiss!

590
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:28,934
French kiss?

591
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:29,958
What's that?

592
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:33,415
You know what it is.

593
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:36,624
I really don't know,
tell me, please.

594
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:44,290
You put your lips together and...

595
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:45,666
What?

596
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:48,332
You put your lips together
and let your tongue do the magic.

597
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:49,790
That's French kiss.

598
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,291
So...

599
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,726
you've French kissed this girl?

600
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,540
Of course! Every time we meet,
we French kiss.

601
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:08,351
I don't want to be your friend,
you talk dirty.

602
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:09,351
Great.

603
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:11,976
You were the one who asked
what a French kiss was!

604
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,290
I don't care,
I don't want to talk to you, ever!

605
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:20,457
And if you ever come to the roof again,
I'll make sure my dad thrashes you.

606
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:35,874
Now that's what you call a crash landing!

607
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:48,624
Okay, so...

608
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:51,499
debit is what comes in,
credit is what goes out.

609
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:54,601
This is the basic rule
for all general entries.

610
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:57,540
Apply this rule and
make a general entry for Rent paid.

611
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:01,665
Ma'am, this is the only
entry I can't get right!

612
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:05,249
Write... rent debit, credit cash.

613
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:11,976
Ma'am, why do we credit cash?

614
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,874
When we get rent
shouldn't we debit it, instead?

615
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:16,892
This isn't the rent you get for
your shop.

616
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:19,040
This is the rent you
have to pay.

617
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,851
Oh! This is that one. Right.

618
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:22,207
Now I get it.

619
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,665
Now apply the basic rule to it.

620
00:40:27,916 --> 00:40:29,124
Which rule?

621
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:30,601
What do you mean, which rule?

622
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,374
I just told you a minute ago.

623
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:33,832
Oh! That one...

624
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:40,540
Debit what comes in,
credit what goes out.

625
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:49,375
Yes, ma'am.

626
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:55,290
What's next?

627
00:41:12,291 --> 00:41:13,851
Zafar, I know what music
means to you...

628
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:16,498
but you have other
responsibilities too, don't you?

629
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:18,875
Neetu?

630
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:21,707
I need your support...

631
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:23,707
not pressure, please!

632
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:25,916
Pressure?

633
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:27,291
Okay.

634
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,749
How much more time do you need?

635
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:31,624
Perfect!

636
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:33,791
Now you doubt me?

637
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,249
Listen, I didn't say that.

638
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,723
But this way it can go on forever, right?

639
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:43,665
Be practical, Zafar...

640
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:45,726
music is good as a hobby.

641
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,415
Music isn't my hobby, Neetu.

642
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:53,040
So what am l... your hobby or...

643
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:54,559
Oh come on, Neetu... seriously...

644
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:56,082
don't behave like a kid.

645
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:59,165
I'm not behaving like a kid,
but you sure are.

646
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:01,415
Tell me, music or me?

647
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:02,625
Neetu!

648
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,832
Music or me?

649
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:13,166
Music.

650
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:34,999
Remember one thing Zafar...

651
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:40,999
if you fail to make it as a musician,
I'll never forgive you.

652
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:44,874
Because you're sacrificing
our relationship for your music.

653
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:47,625
Remember this.

654
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:26,166
Find a fix, find a quick fix

655
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:32,499
Make a quick guess or hit bulls eye

656
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:40,541
Find a fix, find a quick fix

657
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:44,392
What's cooking, bro?

658
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:45,416
Nothing.

659
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:47,540
Sure seemed like something.

660
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,165
A little social service.

661
00:43:50,416 --> 00:43:52,392
Exam papers for the 12th grade are out.

662
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:54,892
I wanted to line up my buyers before
I go buy them.

663
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:56,665
But they're all
a bunch of bloody losers.

664
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:58,458
That's true.

665
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:02,517
You also want papers?

666
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:04,540
No, no, I'm taking tuition classes.

667
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:05,040
Huh!

668
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:06,851
Like tuitions have ever helped anyone?

669
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:08,124
'I'm taking tuition classes.'

670
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:09,517
Actually, you're right.

671
00:44:09,541 --> 00:44:12,207
Accountancy is like a
twisted pretzel for me!

672
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,165
I just don't get it.

673
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:19,124
But not for 12th grade,
I need papers for 1st year college.

674
00:44:19,166 --> 00:44:19,976
Can I get them?

675
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,332
But aren't you studying
through correspondence?

676
00:44:22,958 --> 00:44:24,540
So what?
It's the same thing.

677
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:26,892
College and correspondence
the same thing!

678
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:28,934
If it were the same, we'd be
Doctor Hunny and Choocha by now!

679
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:29,749
Tell me, please...

680
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:31,165
Dude, go and meet Panditji.

681
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:33,040
College and correspondence...

682
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:35,415
Who? The BCMC guy?

683
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:39,249
Yes, he can pull a lot of strings.

684
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:40,726
Meet him and say,
'Hunny referred your name.'

685
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:41,892
He will fix things for you.

686
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:42,582
Okay?

687
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:43,165
See you.

688
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:44,208
How much is it?

689
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,809
Never mind, brother.

690
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:46,833
Chotu...

691
00:44:47,208 --> 00:44:48,540
64 rupees.

692
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:51,207
If you want to save yourself

693
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,642
if you want a future

694
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:55,976
From here and there, from anywhere

695
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,665
Grab what you can

696
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:00,809
You have to reach here.

697
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:04,207
Mr. Narayan Pandit,
from rags to riches.

698
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:05,749
How're you, Panditji?

699
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:09,333
Fine...

700
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,290
God's been kind.

701
00:45:13,125 --> 00:45:14,559
What brings you here?

702
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:16,915
Hunny told me you leak exam papers.

703
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:19,125
What the...

704
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:21,517
Keep it down.

705
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:23,707
You're asking for papers
like they're candy!

706
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Sorry.

707
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,250
Which grade?

708
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:40,082
Now don't keep it so low
that even I can't hear you.

709
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:43,499
Bachelor of Commerce,
first year, correspondence.

710
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:44,874
Only the accountancy paper.

711
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:49,665
I don't mess
around with the university...

712
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:57,415
But I can fix you up with something else.

713
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,226
As in?

714
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,165
You want admission in this college, right?

715
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:01,642
Yes!

716
00:46:01,666 --> 00:46:02,749
I knew it.

717
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:06,374
I don't think you can get in on merit.

718
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:10,636
But if you donate 250,000 to the
President's fund, your seat is fixed.

719
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:12,642
President's fund?

720
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:14,249
Yeah... full guarantee.

721
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:17,415
I will get the form
signed and sealed, myself!

722
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:20,040
Listen carefully... seats are limited.

723
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,851
You delay and
you'll be hanging around for another year.

724
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:23,875
Okay?

725
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:27,124
Only two hundred and fifty thousand!

726
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:28,874
Two hundred and fifty thousand!

727
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:30,415
Two hundred and fifty thousand??

728
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:32,476
You son of a gun.
have you lost it?

729
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,165
Which college takes a fee of 250,000??

730
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:39,082
In my time we studied in makeshift
schools at a two and a half rupee fee...

731
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:40,832
that also sometimes we didn't pay.

732
00:46:40,916 --> 00:46:42,082
250,000!

733
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:44,434
As it is nothing gets in
through your thick skull...

734
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:47,040
Forget bloody college
and sit here at the shop with me.

735
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:49,809
All he does is waste his time...

736
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:51,851
hanging out in college
or chasing girls.

737
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,999
And he wants, two hundred
and fifty thousand!

738
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:03,976
I can't help you.

739
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,892
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

740
00:47:06,916 --> 00:47:08,457
Someone will come...

741
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:12,767
Zafar...

742
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:14,707
I don't know how this happened...

743
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:16,457
he was perfectly fine
when he left home.

744
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:22,040
The doctor suggested that it's better
we admit him to a private hospital.

745
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:25,332
For that we need about 100,000 rupees.

746
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:27,457
And then some
more for treatment.

747
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:31,684
How will we manage that?

748
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:33,874
Take a look at him.

749
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:36,101
Here you go...

750
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:37,559
we've taken the blood sample.

751
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:39,832
You can submit the urine sample
at the desk outside.

752
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:06,625
Zafar...

753
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:09,332
my father thrust a
butcher's knife in my hand...

754
00:48:10,375 --> 00:48:12,582
but your father won't do that to you.

755
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:17,707
Make music with your heart, not your mind.

756
00:48:48,416 --> 00:48:56,416
Find a fix, find a quick fix

757
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,790
Make a quick guess or hit bulls eye

758
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:06,874
Find a fix, find a quick fix

759
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:10,374
if you want to save yourself

760
00:49:10,416 --> 00:49:12,809
if you want a future

761
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:15,165
From here and there, from anywhere

762
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:16,874
Grab what you can

763
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:21,624
Find a fix, find a quick fix

764
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:26,851
The world doesn't rest on hope

765
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:31,601
The world rests on a quick fix

766
00:49:31,625 --> 00:49:34,374
Up and down, everyone is a hustler,

767
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,392
A huge hustler, heavy hustler

768
00:49:36,416 --> 00:49:41,040
You come make your mark too

769
00:49:41,416 --> 00:49:44,999
Make your mark

770
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:47,457
Happy birthday, Pradhanji.

771
00:49:47,666 --> 00:49:50,249
Welcome my dear Bombay princess!

772
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:52,707
Your timing is perfect.

773
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:54,517
I was just thinking about you.

774
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:55,415
Really?

775
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:57,976
I thought you were giving
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

776
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,124
Hello ma'am...

777
00:50:00,708 --> 00:50:02,851
I love the way you play with words.

778
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:04,749
Strikes a chord every time!

779
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,832
Let's talk business.

780
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:11,915
Dimple has sprained her leg
and only you can dance like her.

781
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:13,976
I'll pay you well.

782
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,457
Set the stage on fire, today!

783
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Hi sexy!

784
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:36,124
Are you out of your freaking mind?

785
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:37,642
Come on... you look like a bear.

786
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:39,101
By God, the audience won't enjoy it.

787
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:42,184
You want me to make
an ass of myself for your audience?

788
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:43,309
I'll pay you three thousand more for this.

789
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:43,892
Six!

790
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:44,374
Four!

791
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,934
Done deal, trim down the jungle.

792
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:46,976
Go... shave it off.

793
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,040
Dare you move!

794
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:50,351
Is it your father's bloody crop, you jerk!

795
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:53,290
Pradhan, you better step aside or...

796
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:55,309
I'll actually set fire to the stage!

797
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:56,517
Hey... listen to me.

798
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:57,082
Hunny...

799
00:50:57,125 --> 00:50:58,226
how will we arrange the money?

800
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,499
Don't go!

801
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,809
Pradhan, I'll dance.

802
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:03,101
You
can even tweeze my eyebrows off.

803
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:03,684
Look at this.

804
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:05,624
Unnati, Unnati

805
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:07,915
Shake it baby, Unnati.

806
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:10,040
Your walk is sweet like sugar syrup

807
00:51:10,083 --> 00:51:12,101
Unnati Oh, Unnati.

808
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:13,125
Shut up!

809
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:15,767
Let's go.

810
00:51:15,791 --> 00:51:17,332
Pradhan, I'll dance better.

811
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:34,291
Dude...

812
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:36,374
our destiny isn't sleeping.

813
00:51:36,416 --> 00:51:37,665
It's bloody dead!

814
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,415
Time flies

815
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:46,976
Catch up with it

816
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,540
Come on.

817
00:51:47,833 --> 00:51:50,249
Get into someone's pockets

818
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:52,642
Or fall at someone's feet

819
00:51:52,666 --> 00:51:55,040
if you want to save yourself

820
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:57,434
if you want a future

821
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:59,851
From here and there, from anywhere

822
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:02,207
Grab what you can

823
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:04,351
I always meant when I said that...

824
00:52:04,375 --> 00:52:07,040
I don't guard a college,
but a treasure.

825
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,915
The first few months may look bleak, but
you'll see the results in a year or two.

826
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:13,665
Trust me, it's as good as a pension.

827
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:14,915
Hello Panditji.

828
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:19,915
How nice to see you, Sardarji.
You've come at the right time.

829
00:52:20,291 --> 00:52:21,476
Would you like some tea?

830
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,415
Sure.

831
00:52:22,458 --> 00:52:23,458
have a seat.

832
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,290
What have you decided?

833
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:31,559
Is it possible to get a discount?

834
00:52:31,583 --> 00:52:34,082
How can I give a discount on
a discounted rate?

835
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:37,392
People are paying 350,000.
You can ask Zafar here.

836
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:39,207
What have you got to worry?

837
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:41,184
You're the only son of Mr. Billa,
the famous restaurant owner.

838
00:52:41,208 --> 00:52:44,476
His one stir in his pot
will churn out 250,000!

839
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,540
He will stir fry me in
the same pot instead!

840
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:50,165
In that case,
enjoy your first and last cup of tea here.

841
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,332
Oh come on Panditji...

842
00:52:52,916 --> 00:52:55,249
has anyone ever walked out
of here empty handed?

843
00:52:55,291 --> 00:52:58,601
Your flattery won't help,
let's get straight to business.

844
00:52:58,625 --> 00:53:01,726
You've got only three days to go,
have you managed the money?

845
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:04,207
The thing is Panditji...
we haven't got the money yet.

846
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:06,332
But I have a kick-ass idea.

847
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:08,101
I'll pay for all the
question papers in one go.

848
00:53:08,125 --> 00:53:10,040
All I need is
someone to bankroll us.

849
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:15,124
I wouldn't even bankroll my own son.

850
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:18,351
No offence, but I'm sure your fathers
stand by your own father!

851
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:22,082
It's not a children's savings plan,
it's a business investment.

852
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:25,874
Really? What's this business
that I don't know of?

853
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:27,665
The thing is...

854
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:31,790
our Choocha is a golden goose...

855
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,892
every morning he lays a golden egg.

856
00:53:33,916 --> 00:53:36,499
I mean, every night he has a dream.

857
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:38,642
The next morning I break that dream down
to a lottery number.

858
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:40,124
Hold on!

859
00:53:40,708 --> 00:53:44,624
I take the world for a ride,
don't you try to hoodwink me!

860
00:53:44,666 --> 00:53:47,290
Playing lottery is banned
in Delhi for 10 years.

861
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,207
Panditji...

862
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:52,082
you may be older,
but we are wiser.

863
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:56,290
You sit here in this cubicle, while we've
visited every nook and cranny in this city.

864
00:53:56,750 --> 00:54:00,499
Delhi has four borders,
that's where lotteries are sold in bulk.

865
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:02,332
All you have to do is
mention our name there.

866
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:06,040
If it were a small amount,
we wouldn't bother you.

867
00:54:06,083 --> 00:54:07,601
But this calls for millions.

868
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:09,809
Your investment, our skill...

869
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:11,374
profit for all, what say?

870
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:13,892
Listen, you day dreaming jerk...

871
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:16,040
I'll be right back with Zafar's stuff.

872
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:19,707
have your tea and get going.

873
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:20,874
Zafar, wait for me.

874
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:22,957
Trying to sell a dream to me.

875
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,207
Don't worry, Choocha.
Pandit's an idiot.

876
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,499
He'll regret this later.

877
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,415
Yuck, the miser hasn't even added sugar.

878
00:54:35,458 --> 00:54:37,018
Can you please add some sugar, Choocha?

879
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:44,207
What are the returns like?

880
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:48,517
Brother, the more sugar you add,
sweeter the tea will be.

881
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:49,726
Absolutely!

882
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:52,230
100,000 will give you a million,
200,000 will give two million.

883
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:54,874
You want to invest?

884
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,124
No...

885
00:54:56,166 --> 00:55:01,999
not me, but I know just
the person for that.

886
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:03,875
But...

887
00:55:04,583 --> 00:55:05,583
But what?

888
00:55:06,125 --> 00:55:07,415
You'll be asked for collateral.

889
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:10,726
Of course, we have no objection to that.

890
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,415
We have a necklace on us.

891
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:14,874
Was the tea too hot?

892
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:21,082
Panditji, where's
Bholi Punjaban these days?

893
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,250
What?

894
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:28,915
You heard right.

895
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:30,666
Move...

896
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:37,249
Zafar, are you crazy?

897
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:38,874
What have they brainwashed you with?

898
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:40,642
Don't fall into their trap.

899
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:42,832
They'd even sell their fathers.

900
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:44,999
Don't get into their mess.

901
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:48,665
I'm the one who is in need,
please take us to her.

902
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:51,291
Please.

903
00:55:57,208 --> 00:55:58,208
Fine...

904
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:02,415
I'll take you to her
but 10% of the deal is mine.

905
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:05,165
Why don't you take it all and
turn this shithole into Taj Mahal?

906
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:08,874
Panditji, who is this birdie named
Bholi Punjaban...

907
00:56:09,083 --> 00:56:10,749
whose feathers we haven't counted?

908
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Birdie?

909
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:36,624
That's right!

910
00:56:36,666 --> 00:56:38,082
I am a hustler.

911
00:56:39,791 --> 00:56:41,957
Bholi only has an innocent sounding name.

912
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:47,415
The moment she speaks, it's as if
a tsunami has struck the river Yamuna.

913
00:56:47,916 --> 00:56:48,707
Follow me.

914
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:52,332
Those deflated balloons on your roof
belong to your husband.

915
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,684
Your son stares at my chest all day...

916
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:56,499
with his tongue sticking out like a dog.

917
00:56:56,541 --> 00:56:59,207
If you say another word,
I'll set two bulls free in your house...

918
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:01,124
will strip your whole
family down in public.

919
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:04,142
Oh God, she's made our lives hell here.

920
00:57:04,166 --> 00:57:06,934
I think it's better to sell this house
and move away.

921
00:57:06,958 --> 00:57:09,624
Fall prey to Bholi's abuses and...

922
00:57:09,666 --> 00:57:14,915
your soul won't find a
hole to escape the body!

923
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:16,642
Put Jagbir on the job...

924
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:18,540
make sure they leave the house.

925
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:19,499
Yes, madam.

926
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:23,915
Bholi has got her hands
in every illegal business.

927
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:26,642
Yes? Hello?

928
00:57:26,666 --> 00:57:27,666
Are you done?

929
00:57:28,083 --> 00:57:29,083
How many parties?

930
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:32,290
Madam, two parties have
deposited 50,000 each.

931
00:57:32,541 --> 00:57:35,415
More, more, call more or...

932
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:37,707
I'll make you dance until you're sore.

933
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:38,750
Yes, madam.

934
00:57:38,916 --> 00:57:42,040
Mention Bholi's name
and politicians tremble in fear...

935
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:44,999
and the biggest of stars wet their pants.

936
00:57:45,666 --> 00:57:48,249
Hello beauties,
did you get the payment?

937
00:57:48,291 --> 00:57:49,124
No, madam.

938
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:52,601
He said he is the minister's P.A.
and he won't pay ever again.

939
00:57:52,625 --> 00:57:54,249
Is that so? Dial him for me.

940
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:58,517
Hi, good afternoon.

941
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:00,457
I'm John Miller,
calling you from London and...

942
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,601
I'm glad to inform you that...

943
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:04,915
your email account has won
500,000 British Pounds.

944
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:05,726
Hello?

945
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:08,124
Say hello to your mom!

946
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:11,415
You may be the Minister's PA but
I don't give a damn.

947
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:12,833
Bholi...

948
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:15,290
you are going too far!

949
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:17,165
You won't get the payment.

950
00:58:17,208 --> 00:58:20,290
Listen, the minister is in
a good mood today...

951
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:24,040
send some college girls over
to his farm house.

952
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:27,267
If the minister is in a good mood,
why don't you please him?

953
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:28,476
I'll send over some hot oil.

954
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,415
Get it?

955
00:58:29,458 --> 00:58:31,601
First payment, then enjoyment.

956
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:32,665
Now hang up!

957
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:34,832
Here.

958
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:39,374
Bholi Punjaban isn't any little birdie,
she's a hawk.

959
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,207
The last nail in the coffin.

960
00:58:48,916 --> 00:58:49,790
Ah!

961
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:52,207
Pandit, what a surprise!

962
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:54,934
haven't seen you in a while.

963
00:58:54,958 --> 00:58:56,998
Hope you're not suffering
from some secret disease.

964
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:01,165
Of course not, Bholiji.

965
00:59:01,916 --> 00:59:05,207
Actually, these days my wife
showers me with lot of love...

966
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,124
so I didn't feel the need to drop by.

967
00:59:07,541 --> 00:59:09,457
So then, are you looking to adopt a girl?

968
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,707
Not at all.

969
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:13,790
These boys here have
an investment scheme.

970
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:14,833
Really?

971
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:17,767
I thought they're here to
propose marriage to me.

972
00:59:17,791 --> 00:59:21,976
Listen, I don't deal with insurance agents
and bankers anymore.

973
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,332
They are not those guys...

974
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:26,374
Panditji, let it be.
I'll take over from here.

975
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,124
Madam, I am Hunny
and this here is Choocha.

976
00:59:31,916 --> 00:59:32,916
What?

977
00:59:34,375 --> 00:59:35,375
Dalip.

978
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,707
No, the other one?

979
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:40,833
Choocha.

980
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:43,332
Choocha?

981
00:59:43,916 --> 00:59:44,916
Interesting.

982
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:47,809
And that's your captain?

983
00:59:47,833 --> 00:59:49,499
No madam, I am the captain.

984
00:59:49,541 --> 00:59:51,374
This is our coach, Zafar.

985
00:59:53,083 --> 00:59:54,083
Shoot.

986
00:59:54,666 --> 00:59:55,934
The thing is...

987
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:58,040
our friend Choocha here
has a God given gift.

988
00:59:58,083 --> 01:00:00,351
He has a dream every night.

989
01:00:00,375 --> 01:00:06,351
The next morning I use my God given gift to
break that dream down to a lottery number.

990
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:08,767
We buy a lottery of that number,
the number is drawn and...

991
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:10,124
we win, as simple as that.

992
01:00:13,791 --> 01:00:14,791
Are you done?

993
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:17,249
No madam, not yet.

994
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:27,165
So madam, here's how it works...

995
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:30,351
when we play 220 rupees, we win 2,000.

996
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:33,392
When we play 2,200,
we win 20,000.

997
01:00:33,416 --> 01:00:37,934
If we play 220,000,
we will win 2 million!

998
01:00:37,958 --> 01:00:42,040
If you can lend us that 220,000,
we'll split the jackpot.

999
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:45,040
Moreover, you can have 250,000
from our share...

1000
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:47,392
as an advance payment
towards the leaked question papers.

1001
01:00:47,416 --> 01:00:48,582
So, how do you like the plan?

1002
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:52,832
I've come across a lot of
salesmen in my life...

1003
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:56,124
but never one who sells dreams.

1004
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:57,226
Trust me, madam.

1005
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:59,684
Every time Choocha has
a dream we hit the jackpot.

1006
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:00,915
You can check.

1007
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:06,499
Even if I believe in what
you've just said...

1008
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:09,934
what do you have as
collateral for my investment?

1009
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:12,540
Bholiji, they have a necklace.

1010
01:01:13,666 --> 01:01:14,666
Do you?

1011
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:27,874
Bloody worthless freeloader...

1012
01:01:28,916 --> 01:01:31,207
trying to pawn me
a fake necklace.

1013
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:33,624
Disgusting!

1014
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:36,309
How would I know?

1015
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:39,601
Ever since I was a child,
my mom would wear this for functions...

1016
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:43,374
and tell everyone,
'look at my expensive necklace'.

1017
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:45,040
I did not know, I swear on her.

1018
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:45,559
Great!

1019
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:47,851
Like mother, like son.
What a fraud family.

1020
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:49,457
Now get lost.

1021
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,707
Bunch of losers.

1022
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,832
What if I give you something
as collateral?

1023
01:01:57,916 --> 01:02:01,165
What the hell is happening here, Pandit?

1024
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:03,332
You brought an entire gang?

1025
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:04,892
Planning to get me busted?

1026
01:02:04,916 --> 01:02:05,916
No, Bholiji...

1027
01:02:06,625 --> 01:02:08,892
he had no idea
I was following them.

1028
01:02:08,916 --> 01:02:10,749
I came because
I need the money too.

1029
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:13,976
If its okay,
I can get something for collateral.

1030
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,874
You can shove all your
collaterals up your behind!

1031
01:02:17,916 --> 01:02:20,832
I will only invest for
something substantial.

1032
01:02:22,916 --> 01:02:24,790
How about the deeds to my shop?

1033
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:26,082
Which shop?

1034
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,165
Billa Sweet Shop.

1035
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:32,249
You are Billa's son?

1036
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:35,707
Yes, you know my dad?

1037
01:02:37,541 --> 01:02:40,332
Yes, very well.

1038
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:50,582
Alright, see you tomorrow with the deed
and the lottery number.

1039
01:02:51,666 --> 01:02:52,915
Thank you, Bholiji.

1040
01:02:55,958 --> 01:02:58,915
Get one thing inside
your tiny little brains.

1041
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:01,642
If my money goes down the drain...

1042
01:03:01,666 --> 01:03:03,290
I'll take back twice as much.

1043
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:06,726
If that sounds good, come back tomorrow.

1044
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,999
Otherwise, eat, drink and make merry.

1045
01:03:11,916 --> 01:03:15,374
I'm thinking, if we
double the investment...

1046
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:17,082
we'll get 4 million,
instead of 2.

1047
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:18,624
Two for us and two for Bholi.

1048
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:20,726
Don't be greedy, Hunny.

1049
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:23,790
It's a sure thing and we won't have
to go to her every time.

1050
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:25,226
You think Bholi will agree?

1051
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:27,832
Without a doubt!

1052
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:29,934
So, even I will get 500,000 instead
of 250,000.

1053
01:03:29,958 --> 01:03:32,040
Yes, everyone will get 500,000.

1054
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:34,291
Okay.

1055
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:40,082
Wonderful!

1056
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:42,851
I do all the hard work
and everyone else has all the fun.

1057
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:44,582
You haven't slept yet?

1058
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:49,415
Dude, I don't see your chole-bhatura
working on him.

1059
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:53,790
The chole-bhatura from our sweet shop
could knock a horse out.

1060
01:03:54,875 --> 01:03:56,582
Dude, how's the lassi?

1061
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:57,625
Wait a minute.

1062
01:03:59,666 --> 01:04:02,767
I hope he doesn't get knocked out so badly
that he doesn't remember the dream.

1063
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:05,851
Don't worry, I've added a lot
of almonds in the lassi.

1064
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,499
Watch how it makes his brain run.

1065
01:04:10,666 --> 01:04:14,415
Superb lassi, man.
Well done, Billa!

1066
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:23,267
Now come on Choocha, go to sleep and
dream something nice and crispy.

1067
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:27,165
Don't worry brother,
you'll be served something incredible.

1068
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:37,559
Hunny, as soon as we get the money
I want to buy a pair ofjeans.

1069
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:40,767
The kind that are ripped at the knees,
like Salman Khan wears.

1070
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:43,124
And Fila shoes, with red soles.

1071
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:47,749
Okay, I'll sleep.

1072
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:55,415
No, not jeans...

1073
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:59,499
I'll buy cargo pants
with multiple pockets.

1074
01:04:59,791 --> 01:05:01,767
And in every pocket bundles
of 100 rupee notes.

1075
01:05:01,791 --> 01:05:05,040
We'll spend like crazy
and have butter chicken every day!

1076
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:07,500
Good night.

1077
01:05:24,625 --> 01:05:27,374
Hunny, can you come up on the bed?

1078
01:05:28,166 --> 01:05:30,207
I don't like it all alone.

1079
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,976
I just can't fall asleep.

1080
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,582
Idiot, do you want to suck
on my thumb now??

1081
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:06,625
Go to sleep!

1082
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:08,749
You are excited, aren't you?

1083
01:06:10,416 --> 01:06:14,040
I'll play a nice tune,
it'll help you relax.

1084
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:15,642
That sounds good.

1085
01:06:15,666 --> 01:06:19,124
Hunny, meanwhile, why don't you
give me a nice head massage.

1086
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:22,915
It feels really good
and will help me fall asleep.

1087
01:06:31,625 --> 01:06:36,707
My legs are aching after standing
at Bholi's place for hours.

1088
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:53,957
No Lali, you don't have to...

1089
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:56,582
but okay... if you insist.

1090
01:06:59,791 --> 01:07:01,165
Feels so good...

1091
01:07:03,208 --> 01:07:04,332
Can you turn off the lights?

1092
01:07:11,083 --> 01:07:18,124
Turn off the lights,
I just can't find sleep.

1093
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:24,832
You won't find sleep
even if you turn off the lights

1094
01:07:26,666 --> 01:07:34,540
When will I find a beauty
to turn off the lights for me?

1095
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:44,250
Go off to sleep Choocha,
or else Bholi will wake up.

1096
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:25,374
I won't spare you.

1097
01:09:25,416 --> 01:09:26,416
Get away.

1098
01:09:26,833 --> 01:09:30,290
Here... wham... bam!

1099
01:09:33,083 --> 01:09:35,374
Choocha...

1100
01:09:36,291 --> 01:09:37,291
Hey!

1101
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:39,041
Choocha...

1102
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:40,541
Wake up.

1103
01:09:42,083 --> 01:09:43,249
What happened?

1104
01:09:43,375 --> 01:09:46,040
Come on, out with the golden egg.

1105
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:00,790
Why are you all staring?

1106
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:02,207
Hurry up or I'll punch you.

1107
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:06,124
Dude, you know
I don't remember it easily.

1108
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:07,625
Give me a minute.

1109
01:10:09,458 --> 01:10:10,624
Choocha, come on.

1110
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,582
Yes, now I remember...

1111
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:18,165
I saw that...

1112
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:22,184
you...

1113
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:23,208
I?

1114
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:26,457
I saw that you were...

1115
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,583
dead.

1116
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:31,458
Listen to me...

1117
01:10:31,833 --> 01:10:38,059
I saw that you were dead
and the four legs of your bed...

1118
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:41,874
were slowly turning into the
four ends of your coffin.

1119
01:10:41,916 --> 01:10:46,457
Then Lali, Zafar and Panditji and l..

1120
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:49,790
Carry your coffin
to the crematorium.

1121
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:52,999
As I am about to light the pyre...

1122
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:57,040
your butt catches fire,
you wake up with a jolt and...

1123
01:10:57,416 --> 01:10:59,476
start running towards the jungle.

1124
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,207
And you run into...

1125
01:11:03,916 --> 01:11:05,749
none other than Bholi Punjaban!

1126
01:11:05,791 --> 01:11:10,290
Who transforms into a lion
and swallows you.

1127
01:11:10,916 --> 01:11:13,184
As soon as I reach there...

1128
01:11:13,208 --> 01:11:17,749
I shove my hand in Bholi's mouth,
who is now a lion...

1129
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:19,249
and pull you out.

1130
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:22,165
Your butt's still ablaze.

1131
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:28,374
Anyway, I get furious,
I walk up to Bholi...

1132
01:11:28,416 --> 01:11:33,434
look her straight in the eye and
tear her face in two.

1133
01:11:33,458 --> 01:11:35,976
One part I throw east, the other west.

1134
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Knockout!

1135
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:49,624
Four legs of a bed, four ends of a coffin,
four shoulders...

1136
01:11:50,416 --> 01:11:52,165
the number is definitely four!

1137
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:55,665
A burning pyre?

1138
01:11:56,666 --> 01:11:59,499
Pyre...

1139
01:12:00,791 --> 01:12:03,624
pyre comes from fire...

1140
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,267
So it's the Goddess of fire, Ma Jwala.

1141
01:12:06,291 --> 01:12:07,207
And?

1142
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:08,250
Dude, the...

1143
01:12:09,166 --> 01:12:10,249
Lion!

1144
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:15,415
Lion is what the Goddess Vaishno rides on.

1145
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:17,999
So, we're sure about the Goddess.

1146
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:21,915
Goddess Vaishno is
also known as...

1147
01:12:23,541 --> 01:12:24,541
Durga.

1148
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:27,332
So it's number four on Jai Durga.

1149
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:29,915
Come, it's time to party with Bholi.

1150
01:12:30,583 --> 01:12:32,290
What about your burning butt though?

1151
01:12:35,833 --> 01:12:37,207
Listen, you minister's pet.

1152
01:12:37,625 --> 01:12:39,809
Get this once and for all!

1153
01:12:39,833 --> 01:12:41,934
First you make the payment,
then you get the delivery.

1154
01:12:41,958 --> 01:12:42,749
Got it?

1155
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:43,767
If you haven't...

1156
01:12:43,791 --> 01:12:46,665
come here and I'll make sure
you get it.

1157
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:48,125
Bye!

1158
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:02,790
I didn't think you'd turn up.

1159
01:13:02,958 --> 01:13:04,142
Well, here we are...
loaded with ammunition.

1160
01:13:04,166 --> 01:13:05,166
Just say fire.

1161
01:13:05,541 --> 01:13:07,559
You have a way with words, I must say.

1162
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,934
Out with the name and number.

1163
01:13:08,958 --> 01:13:11,142
Sure, but I have something
else to tell you.

1164
01:13:11,166 --> 01:13:14,226
You see, the jackpot amount is not nearly
enough now that the partners have increased.

1165
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:17,665
I was wondering if you would
invest 440,000 instead of 220,000.

1166
01:13:17,708 --> 01:13:19,415
The profit doubles
and everyone is happy.

1167
01:13:19,458 --> 01:13:20,184
What do you say?

1168
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:21,499
Unbelievable!

1169
01:13:22,125 --> 01:13:24,184
Trying to sell me another deal!

1170
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:25,208
Fine.

1171
01:13:25,791 --> 01:13:28,999
I'm ready to play any amount
you want me to!

1172
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:33,040
But hear me out once again...

1173
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:35,540
if my money goes down the drain...

1174
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:39,207
I'll shove my hand up your behind
and grab twice as much.

1175
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:43,165
Still want me to raise the investment?

1176
01:13:43,291 --> 01:13:43,874
No...

1177
01:13:43,916 --> 01:13:46,207
Bholiji, 440,000 is good.

1178
01:13:47,041 --> 01:13:49,832
In fact, let's just stay at 220,000.

1179
01:13:55,708 --> 01:13:58,624
Sorry madam,
let's keep that deal open for the future.

1180
01:13:58,916 --> 01:14:02,040
Right now, let's just play 440,000
on Jai Durga number four.

1181
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:13,874
Listen Damroo, bet 440,000
on Jai Durga number four, for me.

1182
01:14:14,375 --> 01:14:15,392
Yeah, today's draw.

1183
01:14:15,416 --> 01:14:17,124
Call me as soon as the number is out.

1184
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:13,541
Tell me, Damroo!

1185
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:17,749
Okay.

1186
01:15:51,833 --> 01:15:52,833
Yes?

1187
01:15:54,458 --> 01:15:55,790
Who wants to go first?

1188
01:15:58,208 --> 01:16:01,790
Madam, trust me,
I've never gone wrong with my formula.

1189
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:04,184
Perhaps he said four
and you misheard it.

1190
01:16:04,208 --> 01:16:05,624
Why don't you check again?

1191
01:16:05,666 --> 01:16:08,809
Why don't I shove the phone
down your throat, you smartass?

1192
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:10,665
That way you can keep dialling.

1193
01:16:10,708 --> 01:16:11,708
Get it?

1194
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:13,707
Bholiji, what about my shop deeds?

1195
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:14,750
Shut up!

1196
01:16:15,375 --> 01:16:17,749
Coach, you better control your team!

1197
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:21,207
Yes?
How do I get back my money?

1198
01:16:28,666 --> 01:16:31,142
Don't whisper in his ear.

1199
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:32,249
Speak up, loud and clear.

1200
01:16:32,666 --> 01:16:33,976
Madamji, I told...

1201
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Shh!

1202
01:16:35,541 --> 01:16:38,934
Madamji, I told him that we
should work out installments.

1203
01:16:38,958 --> 01:16:41,207
We'll pay back a little every month.

1204
01:16:42,541 --> 01:16:43,541
Why not?

1205
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:46,226
I'll come up with an EMl scheme,
just for you.

1206
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:49,082
On this note slap yourself real hard.

1207
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:50,625
Why?

1208
01:16:51,625 --> 01:16:53,809
Slap yourself or he will do it.

1209
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:56,582
I'll do it, don't bother him.

1210
01:16:58,375 --> 01:17:00,082
Harder.

1211
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:02,832
Hey...

1212
01:17:05,166 --> 01:17:06,184
Is that good?

1213
01:17:06,208 --> 01:17:07,415
Happy?

1214
01:17:14,041 --> 01:17:16,499
And you, Billa's little puppy,
should I call him?

1215
01:17:16,541 --> 01:17:19,124
No, please don't call dad.

1216
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:21,457
Well then,
tell me how you intend to pay me back.

1217
01:17:22,083 --> 01:17:23,457
We don't have the money.

1218
01:17:24,166 --> 01:17:27,040
If we had,
we wouldn't have come to you.

1219
01:17:27,708 --> 01:17:30,290
We needed the money to get into college

1220
01:17:30,708 --> 01:17:35,415
But here you need the money to get out.

1221
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:43,040
In that case, why don't you tell us
what to do?

1222
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:46,582
As he said, we don't have the money.

1223
01:18:08,041 --> 01:18:09,874
I just have one way out for you.

1224
01:18:11,041 --> 01:18:15,165
There's a rave party tonight
at the Faridabad-Gurgaon border.

1225
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:18,582
And this is what you'll have to do.

1226
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:22,832
I'll give you some pills that
you have to sell there.

1227
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:26,540
Each pill is for 3,000 rupees.

1228
01:18:26,791 --> 01:18:28,082
And you'll have 500 such pills.

1229
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:31,874
You think it'll sell at that price?

1230
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,290
Like hot cakes!

1231
01:18:37,166 --> 01:18:39,040
It will be teeming with
the rich and wealthy.

1232
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:45,207
So?

1233
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:49,040
Alright madam, we will do it.

1234
01:18:57,583 --> 01:18:59,124
Do you know what those pills are?

1235
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:01,415
Whatever they are,
we have to sell them.

1236
01:19:01,458 --> 01:19:03,934
I don't think Bholi is ready
to negotiate.

1237
01:19:03,958 --> 01:19:05,457
It's an order, not a request.

1238
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:06,976
How will you sell the pills?

1239
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,600
Just like you sell samosas at your shop.

1240
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:09,665
Hunny, tell him to shut up.

1241
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:12,999
Relax! Even I am afraid.

1242
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:17,207
But shedding tears or raising your Voice
won't get you anywhere with Bholi.

1243
01:19:19,166 --> 01:19:21,040
Let me know if you have another option.

1244
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:24,665
Dude, which of these is the door?

1245
01:19:28,291 --> 01:19:29,291
Move out!

1246
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:33,665
500 pills and no
hanky-panky with the money, okay?

1247
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:40,374
Chooch!

1248
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:42,207
You're staying with me.

1249
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:44,750
I knew it!

1250
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:49,332
Looking at the love for me in your eyes,
I didn't want to leave.

1251
01:19:49,625 --> 01:19:50,684
Let them go.

1252
01:19:50,708 --> 01:19:52,540
In fact,
even the Chicago Bulls should go.

1253
01:19:52,916 --> 01:19:58,374
My stories will make you fall
head over heels in love with me.

1254
01:19:58,416 --> 01:20:00,790
Go on, I'll be fine.

1255
01:20:01,208 --> 01:20:04,332
In my 30 years on earth
and 16 year career...

1256
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:08,684
no one has ever
yapped such bullshit around me.

1257
01:20:08,708 --> 01:20:09,976
I really don't get you.

1258
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,665
Who do you think you are?

1259
01:20:11,708 --> 01:20:13,957
Talking rubbish all the time!

1260
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:18,624
You can leave, he remains here.

1261
01:20:19,416 --> 01:20:21,184
Another thing...

1262
01:20:21,208 --> 01:20:22,665
if you get into any trouble...

1263
01:20:22,708 --> 01:20:24,624
I don't know you and you don't know me.

1264
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,707
All I care about is my money.

1265
01:20:26,958 --> 01:20:30,165
Otherwise you'll be joining
my handicapped army.

1266
01:20:34,583 --> 01:20:35,583
Get it?

1267
01:20:35,916 --> 01:20:36,916
Now leave!

1268
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:39,142
Lali...

1269
01:20:39,166 --> 01:20:43,332
why don't you give me your phone,
that way I can stay in touch.

1270
01:20:43,375 --> 01:20:47,249
I mean, you shouldn't think I'm ignoring
you guys just because I'm with a girl.

1271
01:21:06,125 --> 01:21:07,125
Priya...

1272
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:10,832
Yeah?
What do you want?

1273
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:13,101
Can't I call you?

1274
01:21:13,125 --> 01:21:15,707
Hurry up, I need to study
for the exams.

1275
01:21:17,958 --> 01:21:19,290
Here.

1276
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:21,750
What's this?

1277
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,540
The latest chartbusters.

1278
01:21:23,916 --> 01:21:25,749
Why are you giving this to me?

1279
01:21:25,791 --> 01:21:27,499
It's a gift, just take it.

1280
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:28,915
But why?

1281
01:21:29,833 --> 01:21:32,934
Listen, there's a fabulous
party happening in Gurgaon later.

1282
01:21:32,958 --> 01:21:34,059
And you're coming with me.

1283
01:21:34,083 --> 01:21:35,374
have you lost your mind?

1284
01:21:35,416 --> 01:21:37,101
There are still three days
to go for the exams.

1285
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:38,517
And anyway, I'll give you the
question paper the day before.

1286
01:21:38,541 --> 01:21:40,374
You can easily learn the answers.

1287
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:44,832
I don't want your CD,
I don't want the papers...

1288
01:21:44,875 --> 01:21:47,415
and I don't want to
go to the party either!

1289
01:21:47,458 --> 01:21:49,874
Why don't you take your
girlfriend with you?

1290
01:21:50,291 --> 01:21:51,415
Well...

1291
01:21:53,458 --> 01:21:55,332
we broke up today.

1292
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:57,874
What do you mean, broke up?

1293
01:21:58,583 --> 01:22:00,499
What's it to you?

1294
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,082
Are you thinking of me as
your boyfriend?

1295
01:22:03,708 --> 01:22:04,851
What nonsense!

1296
01:22:04,875 --> 01:22:06,707
It's not like you've
said 'l love you' to me.

1297
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:09,957
If I do, will you reconsider?

1298
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,790
Go away.

1299
01:22:13,625 --> 01:22:14,625
Not fair.

1300
01:22:15,125 --> 01:22:18,707
I thought I'd take you along
and we'd have a great time.

1301
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:20,851
I had such a tough time
convincing my friends about you.

1302
01:22:20,875 --> 01:22:22,374
And now you're playing hard to get.

1303
01:22:23,666 --> 01:22:26,642
We're gentlemen,
I'll bring you back home safe?

1304
01:22:26,666 --> 01:22:29,457
Don't complain later that
you couldn't attend the party.

1305
01:22:30,458 --> 01:22:32,184
What excuse do I give at home?

1306
01:22:32,208 --> 01:22:33,582
Make up anything.

1307
01:22:33,625 --> 01:22:35,865
Say you are staying over
at your friend's place to study.

1308
01:22:40,458 --> 01:22:42,332
Fine, I'll come along.

1309
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:44,892
Pick me up from outside the Jain temple.

1310
01:22:44,916 --> 01:22:47,184
Great, I'll pick you up at 9pm.

1311
01:22:47,208 --> 01:22:50,040
And no salwar-kameez, okay?

1312
01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:53,207
You should look hot.

1313
01:22:56,208 --> 01:22:57,208
Priya!

1314
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:01,707
I love you.

1315
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:17,249
What's the big deal about this pill
that it costs 3,000 rupees?

1316
01:23:19,208 --> 01:23:21,665
For that amount,
I could get a month's groceries...

1317
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:24,749
or pay ten years of school fees...

1318
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,040
or buy ten pairs ofjeans...

1319
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:30,082
And this one pill is worth so much?

1320
01:23:30,791 --> 01:23:33,226
There's definitely a big deal,
got to figure this thing out.

1321
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:35,267
Hunny, stop talking nonsense!

1322
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:37,582
Each pill is accounted for.

1323
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:39,457
Don't create another mess.

1324
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:41,101
As it is, you've brought a girl along.

1325
01:23:41,125 --> 01:23:43,790
Will you stop with the sermon!

1326
01:23:43,833 --> 01:23:45,374
have you ever been to a party?

1327
01:23:45,416 --> 01:23:47,707
Stags like us are not allowed in.

1328
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:50,124
But a girl helps open doors.

1329
01:23:58,541 --> 01:23:59,601
Look...

1330
01:23:59,625 --> 01:24:00,957
here comes our passport.

1331
01:24:58,666 --> 01:24:59,999
I must say...

1332
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,790
there's something amusing about you.

1333
01:25:03,958 --> 01:25:06,059
What's with your dreams?

1334
01:25:06,083 --> 01:25:08,749
There's a very long story to it.

1335
01:25:08,791 --> 01:25:12,290
I'd like to hear it.

1336
01:25:14,291 --> 01:25:16,207
If you say so.

1337
01:25:17,791 --> 01:25:22,415
Madam, it begins more than 20 million
years ago, when I was a little boy...

1338
01:25:22,458 --> 01:25:23,851
Hold on!

1339
01:25:23,875 --> 01:25:25,415
How many years ago?

1340
01:25:25,458 --> 01:25:28,726
Were your ancestors even born back then?

1341
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:30,101
This isn't right.

1342
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:34,040
Just because I love you
doesn't mean you can interrupt me.

1343
01:25:34,083 --> 01:25:37,457
This is how I narrate my story
and it begins 20 million years ago.

1344
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,790
You either hear the story
or pass me that plate.

1345
01:25:40,208 --> 01:25:41,457
I'm sorry.

1346
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:44,559
Narrate it the way you want, alright?

1347
01:25:44,583 --> 01:25:45,749
Shoot!

1348
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:51,207
It begins 20 billion years ago...

1349
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,457
It's all good now?

1350
01:27:10,416 --> 01:27:12,457
I'm here, and so is my friend

1351
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:15,540
It's all good now?

1352
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:17,226
I'm here, and so is my friend

1353
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:19,582
And an evening of great fun

1354
01:27:19,625 --> 01:27:23,017
The chance is good, have fun

1355
01:27:23,041 --> 01:27:26,457
Make the most of this

1356
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:29,892
The chance is good, have fun

1357
01:27:29,916 --> 01:27:33,332
Make the most of this

1358
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:37,726
And that's when Chacha
Nehru called me from the moon...

1359
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:39,976
and I said, "Yes, Choocha speaking."

1360
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
So Chacha Nehru said...

1361
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,082
Who knew the world could be spirited

1362
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:01,642
With dance and music,
with rhythm and clapping

1363
01:28:01,666 --> 01:28:05,142
That I would get both love and money

1364
01:28:05,166 --> 01:28:08,499
I was ruined till now,
now I'll have everyjoy.

1365
01:28:08,541 --> 01:28:10,582
With a click

1366
01:28:12,166 --> 01:28:15,540
With a click I could get
all my heart desires

1367
01:28:15,583 --> 01:28:18,457
Now we can have chicken
for two meals everyday.

1368
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,457
It's all good now?

1369
01:28:22,416 --> 01:28:24,457
I'm here, and so is my friend

1370
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:27,540
It's all good now?

1371
01:28:27,583 --> 01:28:29,226
I'm here, and so is my friend

1372
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:31,582
And an evening of great fun

1373
01:28:31,625 --> 01:28:35,017
The chance is good, have fun

1374
01:28:35,041 --> 01:28:38,457
Make the most of this

1375
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:41,892
The chance is good, have fun

1376
01:28:41,916 --> 01:28:45,332
Make the most of this

1377
01:28:56,708 --> 01:29:00,142
lgnore the words of the sane

1378
01:29:00,166 --> 01:29:03,499
Darling, why not speak the words of love?

1379
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:06,934
If you ever want to go shopping,
come here

1380
01:29:06,958 --> 01:29:10,226
I've set up a shop of dreams in my eyes

1381
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:12,624
I am putting my heart up for sale

1382
01:29:13,875 --> 01:29:17,184
I am putting my heart up
for sale at half the rate

1383
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:20,624
I've split my head banging
it on your door

1384
01:29:20,666 --> 01:29:23,165
It's all good now?

1385
01:29:24,083 --> 01:29:26,124
I'm here, and so is my friend

1386
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:29,184
It's all good now?

1387
01:29:29,208 --> 01:29:30,915
I'm here, and so is my friend

1388
01:29:30,958 --> 01:29:33,226
And an evening of great fun

1389
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:36,665
The chance is good, have fun

1390
01:29:36,708 --> 01:29:40,142
Make the most of this

1391
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:43,540
The chance is good, have fun

1392
01:29:43,583 --> 01:29:47,040
Make the most of this

1393
01:30:35,583 --> 01:30:36,583
Catch him.

1394
01:30:37,416 --> 01:30:39,184
Leave him, Go after that guy!

1395
01:30:39,208 --> 01:30:39,624
Quickly.

1396
01:30:39,666 --> 01:30:40,666
Catch him.

1397
01:31:24,833 --> 01:31:25,833
Priya...

1398
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:29,624
are you my girlfriend?

1399
01:31:35,166 --> 01:31:36,207
Answer me...

1400
01:31:38,083 --> 01:31:40,374
I even said 'l love you'.

1401
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:43,040
Priya?

1402
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:45,517
Talk to me.

1403
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:48,142
Remember what you said on the roof?

1404
01:31:48,166 --> 01:31:50,165
Sir, there's no one else around here.

1405
01:31:52,208 --> 01:31:53,208
Let's go.

1406
01:32:07,583 --> 01:32:09,707
Priya?

1407
01:32:11,125 --> 01:32:12,125
Priya...

1408
01:32:14,583 --> 01:32:16,082
What do you think of yourself?

1409
01:32:16,458 --> 01:32:19,374
What's wrong?
What did I do?

1410
01:32:19,916 --> 01:32:21,226
What did you do?

1411
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:23,999
You lied and brought me to
a party of drug addicts.

1412
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:26,582
Right now you tried to
take advantage of me.

1413
01:32:26,625 --> 01:32:28,124
Yet you're asking what you did!

1414
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,415
I was stupid, I got carried away...

1415
01:32:33,041 --> 01:32:35,957
I thought you really liked me.

1416
01:32:36,541 --> 01:32:40,559
I always believed there was
some innocence behind your pranks.

1417
01:32:40,583 --> 01:32:43,874
I considered you a good person,
but your intentions are pure evil.

1418
01:32:44,375 --> 01:32:45,642
That's not true, Priya...

1419
01:32:45,666 --> 01:32:47,059
I really like you.

1420
01:32:47,083 --> 01:32:48,290
Don't you touch me!

1421
01:32:49,208 --> 01:32:51,582
You are a no-good scoundrel.

1422
01:32:51,625 --> 01:32:52,707
A pest!

1423
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:56,874
Never show your face again.

1424
01:33:09,541 --> 01:33:11,582
Sir, he seems to be a pro at racing.

1425
01:33:11,875 --> 01:33:13,957
But his motorcycle is his downfall.

1426
01:33:14,208 --> 01:33:15,688
It's thumping roar will give it away.

1427
01:33:57,750 --> 01:33:58,999
Do you know Neetu?

1428
01:34:00,208 --> 01:34:01,624
Tell me, how do you know her?

1429
01:34:01,666 --> 01:34:03,642
Don't answer my question
with a question.

1430
01:34:03,666 --> 01:34:05,184
How do you know Neetu?

1431
01:34:05,208 --> 01:34:05,957
Who is it?

1432
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
- Zafar.
- Lali.

1433
01:34:17,208 --> 01:34:18,415
What's the meaning of this?

1434
01:34:18,458 --> 01:34:20,082
And at this late hour?

1435
01:34:20,750 --> 01:34:24,124
Ma'am, I'll explain everything,
but first please hide this somewhere.

1436
01:34:24,833 --> 01:34:25,624
What's in it?

1437
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:27,499
Ma'am, it has...

1438
01:34:27,541 --> 01:34:28,726
Neetu, it's drugs.

1439
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:31,624
The cops are after us,
please hide this somewhere.

1440
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,499
Yes, ma'am, please.

1441
01:34:34,625 --> 01:34:38,624
Ma'am, please...

1442
01:34:51,916 --> 01:34:52,749
Where's the packet?

1443
01:34:52,791 --> 01:34:54,017
Sir... what packet?

1444
01:34:54,041 --> 01:34:55,457
I don't understand...

1445
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:57,750
Now do you?

1446
01:34:58,041 --> 01:34:59,415
Where did you hide the packet?

1447
01:34:59,458 --> 01:35:02,809
Sir, sorry, I was afraid and
that's why I lied.

1448
01:35:02,833 --> 01:35:04,582
Tell me, where is the packet?

1449
01:35:04,625 --> 01:35:06,642
Sir, it fell somewhere in the commotion.

1450
01:35:06,666 --> 01:35:07,457
I swear.

1451
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,582
Check the place.

1452
01:35:09,708 --> 01:35:11,934
Sir, why are you asking
about the packet?

1453
01:35:11,958 --> 01:35:14,040
You don't know why I'm asking?

1454
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:14,915
Smartass...

1455
01:35:14,958 --> 01:35:15,790
Sir... you...

1456
01:35:15,833 --> 01:35:17,707
Hold that thought,
I'll be right with you.

1457
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:18,267
Answer me.

1458
01:35:18,291 --> 01:35:22,207
Sir, the packet you're talking about probably
contains take away menu's of his restaurant.

1459
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:24,457
Which he is saying he dropped somewhere.

1460
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:25,500
Yes, sir.

1461
01:35:26,583 --> 01:35:28,249
Are you his counsel?

1462
01:35:29,541 --> 01:35:32,207
Then you must be knowing
the colour of his underwear too.

1463
01:35:32,958 --> 01:35:34,415
Isn't it?

1464
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,332
So, tell me, what was on
the menu besides marijuana?

1465
01:35:39,375 --> 01:35:44,392
Sir, I don't even drink dark chocolate,
let alone do drugs.

1466
01:35:44,416 --> 01:35:46,415
You can test if you want.

1467
01:35:46,458 --> 01:35:50,601
Sir, I have a catering business, thought
I'd fetch some orders for future parties.

1468
01:35:50,625 --> 01:35:53,332
And right now there aren't too
many weddings taking place.

1469
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:57,082
If you were innocent,
why did you run?

1470
01:35:57,666 --> 01:36:00,415
Sir, as soon as I got there,
it was chaos.

1471
01:36:00,458 --> 01:36:04,226
People were screaming, 'run,
the cops are here!'

1472
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:05,749
And so I ran.

1473
01:36:05,791 --> 01:36:09,665
My dad always says, 'stay away
from cops and thugs'.

1474
01:36:09,708 --> 01:36:11,624
'They're two sides of the same coin.'

1475
01:36:11,666 --> 01:36:15,165
I don't know about thugs, but you
should definitely stay away from cops.

1476
01:36:15,625 --> 01:36:16,499
Come on.

1477
01:36:16,541 --> 01:36:19,017
Narrate the rest of your story
at the police station.

1478
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:20,184
And call your old wise man too.

1479
01:36:20,208 --> 01:36:20,707
Sir... no, sir.

1480
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:21,750
Did you find it?

1481
01:36:22,083 --> 01:36:23,499
Excuse me, who are you?

1482
01:36:24,208 --> 01:36:25,915
How did you just barge in to my house?

1483
01:36:26,541 --> 01:36:29,707
He will tell you, who I am.
Just showed him my lD.

1484
01:36:30,541 --> 01:36:33,249
He made us run after him like dogs
for 45 minutes.

1485
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,165
There's nothing here, sir.

1486
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:37,851
What's the meaning of this?

1487
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:39,582
How can you search
without a warrant?

1488
01:36:40,208 --> 01:36:41,415
How do you know them?

1489
01:36:41,458 --> 01:36:43,267
I am Neetu, and this is Lali, my student.

1490
01:36:43,291 --> 01:36:44,957
He takes tuitions from me.

1491
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,332
And this is my fiance, Zafar.

1492
01:36:50,375 --> 01:36:52,749
You give tuitions at this hour?

1493
01:36:53,916 --> 01:36:55,832
Listen, I too have graduated.

1494
01:36:55,875 --> 01:36:58,207
I've been a student and a teacher.

1495
01:36:58,708 --> 01:37:00,624
And I've been engaged quite a few times.

1496
01:37:01,708 --> 01:37:03,976
You're fortunate that
we didn't get the packet.

1497
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,184
But don't think you are free.

1498
01:37:06,208 --> 01:37:09,582
Come and see me
at the police station tomorrow.

1499
01:37:09,625 --> 01:37:10,625
Get it?

1500
01:37:11,083 --> 01:37:12,165
Let's go.

1501
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:20,999
What is it that you're studying, anyway?

1502
01:37:22,041 --> 01:37:22,915
Sir...

1503
01:37:22,958 --> 01:37:24,976
Debit what comes in...

1504
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,874
credit what goes out.

1505
01:37:44,583 --> 01:37:47,207
I can't believe you could
stoop so low.

1506
01:37:47,625 --> 01:37:50,874
Ma'am, how do you know Zafar?

1507
01:37:51,541 --> 01:37:53,101
I'll deal with you later.

1508
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:54,999
Sit over there.

1509
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:58,415
And you, cat got your tongue?
Speak up.

1510
01:37:59,125 --> 01:38:01,915
No matter what I say,
you won't believe it.

1511
01:38:03,041 --> 01:38:04,249
How nice, Zafar!

1512
01:38:05,416 --> 01:38:07,082
Why did you ever walk into my life?

1513
01:38:07,416 --> 01:38:09,476
You've messed up
my peaceful existence.

1514
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,874
You're neither with me
nor have you let me go.

1515
01:38:12,625 --> 01:38:14,124
And your ego!

1516
01:38:14,791 --> 01:38:17,582
You could have told me,
at least said a word.

1517
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:18,934
You can apologise a million times...

1518
01:38:18,958 --> 01:38:21,332
but couldn't share your
problem with me?

1519
01:38:23,083 --> 01:38:24,374
Excuse me, ma'am!

1520
01:38:24,416 --> 01:38:28,624
Ma'am, please tell me
where you hid the packet.

1521
01:38:28,833 --> 01:38:30,101
have you completely lost it, Lali?

1522
01:38:30,125 --> 01:38:31,665
You still want the packet?

1523
01:38:31,708 --> 01:38:32,868
I flushed it down the toilet.

1524
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
What?

1525
01:38:36,208 --> 01:38:37,790
You flushed it?

1526
01:38:37,833 --> 01:38:39,665
have you lost your mind?

1527
01:38:39,708 --> 01:38:41,267
Do you know what you've done?

1528
01:38:41,291 --> 01:38:42,540
Lali, behave yourself!

1529
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:44,874
Behave myself?

1530
01:38:45,291 --> 01:38:47,665
You flushed 1.5 million rupees!

1531
01:38:47,708 --> 01:38:50,624
And with it my shop's deed.

1532
01:38:50,666 --> 01:38:52,540
Did you give it any thought?

1533
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,582
You already seem to have a thing for Zafar.

1534
01:38:56,083 --> 01:38:58,665
Why didn't you tell me you
are his girlfriend?

1535
01:38:58,708 --> 01:39:00,540
You betrayed me!

1536
01:39:00,583 --> 01:39:01,559
What rubbish, Lali?

1537
01:39:01,583 --> 01:39:02,684
How did I betray you?

1538
01:39:02,708 --> 01:39:07,749
When a crumb was stuck
in my moustache, didn't you brush it off?

1539
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:10,976
Didn't you rest your hand on my shoulder,
while riding with me on the bike?

1540
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,707
Didn't you want Shalu and me to break up,
so something could start between us?

1541
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:17,809
Why did you do those things
if you didn't like me?

1542
01:39:17,833 --> 01:39:18,934
Oh God!

1543
01:39:18,958 --> 01:39:21,017
I didn't know you were such a fool!

1544
01:39:21,041 --> 01:39:22,457
I didn't betray you.

1545
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:23,707
Idiot!

1546
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:42,999
Can I use your phone?

1547
01:39:44,541 --> 01:39:45,541
Please?

1548
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:07,165
Yes, Choocha speaking.

1549
01:40:07,208 --> 01:40:09,082
Choocha, we're in a terrible mess.

1550
01:40:09,125 --> 01:40:10,142
What did you say?

1551
01:40:10,166 --> 01:40:10,749
Choocha?

1552
01:40:10,791 --> 01:40:11,934
Give me the phone.

1553
01:40:11,958 --> 01:40:12,934
Who is this?

1554
01:40:12,958 --> 01:40:14,184
Listen Choocha or whoever you are...

1555
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:15,809
don't you drag them into any mess,
get it?

1556
01:40:15,833 --> 01:40:16,892
Hello, madam...

1557
01:40:16,916 --> 01:40:19,457
how dare you call me Choocha,
do you even know me?

1558
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,184
Listen, it's me, Lali.

1559
01:40:21,208 --> 01:40:23,790
Lali or lollypop,
don't you call me Choocha!

1560
01:40:23,833 --> 01:40:26,184
And why are you talking in
a girl's Voice?

1561
01:40:26,208 --> 01:40:28,499
That's not me,
that was Neetu madam.

1562
01:40:29,375 --> 01:40:33,249
Oh I see,
it's a cross connection.

1563
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:35,851
Hang up and call me again.

1564
01:40:35,875 --> 01:40:36,875
Hello?

1565
01:40:44,916 --> 01:40:46,832
Yes, Choocha speaking.

1566
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:49,226
Listen, it's all over.

1567
01:40:49,250 --> 01:40:50,851
We have no idea where
Hunny and Priya are.

1568
01:40:50,875 --> 01:40:53,332
And we've also lost the pills.

1569
01:40:53,375 --> 01:40:56,934
All I can say is
we were saved by a whisker!

1570
01:40:56,958 --> 01:40:59,499
I suggest you escape too.
And I mean it.

1571
01:41:00,041 --> 01:41:01,041
Do you hear me?

1572
01:41:01,541 --> 01:41:06,832
Hello?

1573
01:41:32,875 --> 01:41:35,165
Yes Khanna, did you raid the party?

1574
01:41:35,208 --> 01:41:37,999
Yes, but the narcotics
squad was also there.

1575
01:41:38,416 --> 01:41:39,892
Whom did you send
this time with the pills?

1576
01:41:39,916 --> 01:41:41,165
He escaped with it.

1577
01:41:41,708 --> 01:41:43,059
Escaped?

1578
01:41:43,083 --> 01:41:44,624
Bloody government mongrel!

1579
01:41:44,666 --> 01:41:46,892
You aren't there
to sniff out useless things.

1580
01:41:46,916 --> 01:41:48,582
At least once be on time.

1581
01:41:49,208 --> 01:41:51,082
You ruined the entire plan, you idiot.

1582
01:41:51,833 --> 01:41:54,476
What if he comes back with the packet now?
Nothing I could do to him.

1583
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:56,582
It's a loss... hang up now.

1584
01:42:00,458 --> 01:42:03,017
Madam, Choocha run...

1585
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:04,957
Then you also run, son of a gun!

1586
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,624
Run!

1587
01:42:06,666 --> 01:42:07,666
Yes, madam.

1588
01:42:10,583 --> 01:42:11,017
Hello?

1589
01:42:11,041 --> 01:42:12,957
Dude, what have you gotten me into?

1590
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:13,976
Where's Hunny?

1591
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:14,915
I don't know.

1592
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:16,267
The cops raided the place
and everyone escaped.

1593
01:42:16,291 --> 01:42:18,665
And you conveniently got to a girl's place.

1594
01:42:18,708 --> 01:42:19,708
Fantastic!

1595
01:42:20,083 --> 01:42:21,332
You got me screwed.

1596
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:23,415
I'll come and get you.
Where are you?

1597
01:42:23,708 --> 01:42:25,540
I'm near Yamuna market.

1598
01:42:25,583 --> 01:42:27,684
Hurry up!

1599
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:29,957
Don't forget to get me a cola.

1600
01:42:32,791 --> 01:42:33,791
Cola?

1601
01:42:49,041 --> 01:42:49,915
Madam Bholi...

1602
01:42:49,958 --> 01:42:52,582
man on ground,
holding Bobby's balls.

1603
01:42:52,625 --> 01:42:53,540
What to do?

1604
01:42:53,583 --> 01:42:55,624
Break his hand and bring him fast.

1605
01:42:55,958 --> 01:42:56,958
Okay, madam.

1606
01:43:13,583 --> 01:43:15,915
Yes, where are you going?

1607
01:43:19,291 --> 01:43:20,165
Where are you going?

1608
01:43:20,208 --> 01:43:21,582
Stop.
Where are you going?

1609
01:43:21,625 --> 01:43:22,625
Where are you going?

1610
01:43:50,375 --> 01:43:51,375
Cola?

1611
01:44:02,291 --> 01:44:04,457
She's not called Bholi Punjaban
for nothing.

1612
01:44:05,583 --> 01:44:07,415
Don't even think about running away.

1613
01:44:07,916 --> 01:44:11,832
Anyway, you losers won't have passports
to get out of the country...

1614
01:44:12,708 --> 01:44:15,809
and if you hide anywhere here,
she will hunt you down.

1615
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:18,457
Panditji, we're not here to be insulted.

1616
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:20,140
Tell us if you've got a solution to this.

1617
01:44:20,958 --> 01:44:22,665
You can do away with the attitude.

1618
01:44:23,583 --> 01:44:27,582
I suggest, you go to Bholi
and let her do what she wants to.

1619
01:44:27,916 --> 01:44:30,082
In that case,
should we stand straight or bend over?

1620
01:44:40,166 --> 01:44:41,415
Pandit is right.

1621
01:44:42,208 --> 01:44:43,624
Are you serious, Zafar?

1622
01:44:43,666 --> 01:44:45,226
Of course, I am...

1623
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:48,124
or else let me know if
you have another option.

1624
01:44:57,833 --> 01:45:01,874
I knew you were a hustler
when you told me about the dream and...

1625
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:05,082
gave me your fraud mom's fake necklace!

1626
01:45:05,416 --> 01:45:08,999
That's when I knew that
you are a pain in the butt!

1627
01:45:09,541 --> 01:45:14,165
I feel like letting my men loose on you and throw
you into the Yamuna river, tied to a big rock.

1628
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,457
But if you drown,
I won't get my money back.

1629
01:45:19,125 --> 01:45:21,874
Now, listen to me carefully...
last chance...

1630
01:45:23,458 --> 01:45:25,624
You have 24 hours...

1631
01:45:26,583 --> 01:45:29,999
to get me back my money, 2.5 million.

1632
01:45:33,458 --> 01:45:34,976
2.5 million?

1633
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Yes...

1634
01:45:37,541 --> 01:45:39,249
two-point-five million.

1635
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:43,999
880,000 for the lotteries
and 1.5 for the pills.

1636
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:47,040
Bholiji, that adds up to 2.38 million.

1637
01:45:47,083 --> 01:45:48,624
What's the extra for?

1638
01:45:48,666 --> 01:45:50,999
Bloody Einstein!

1639
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:54,415
The extra is for pardoning you.

1640
01:45:54,458 --> 01:45:58,457
To be honest you guys are actually
worthless but I am quite generous.

1641
01:45:59,583 --> 01:46:03,999
2.5 million or else Billa's restaurant
will be my new address.

1642
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,624
Are you sure?
You don't want me to come with you?

1643
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:30,582
No, let it be, I'll manage.

1644
01:46:31,666 --> 01:46:37,540
The world can read the wisdom
of the texts

1645
01:46:38,083 --> 01:46:43,624
and yet it won't find contentment.

1646
01:46:45,375 --> 01:46:53,375
Two and a half letters ofjugaad

1647
01:47:01,791 --> 01:47:07,124
if read, you will be set

1648
01:47:17,708 --> 01:47:22,101
There is fighting everywhere,
there is sorrow

1649
01:47:22,125 --> 01:47:26,934
Become alert

1650
01:47:26,958 --> 01:47:31,707
Don't go around in circles,
O innocent one

1651
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:36,874
Now, focus on your goal

1652
01:47:36,916 --> 01:47:44,101
Focus on the goal,
on the innocent goal, focus.

1653
01:47:44,125 --> 01:47:46,499
The deadline

1654
01:47:46,541 --> 01:47:48,892
ls killing everyone

1655
01:47:48,916 --> 01:47:51,226
Even in their sleep,

1656
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:53,707
Everyone's running a race

1657
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:56,059
if you want to save yourself

1658
01:47:56,083 --> 01:47:58,499
if you want a future

1659
01:47:58,541 --> 01:48:00,934
From here and there, from anywhere

1660
01:48:00,958 --> 01:48:02,934
Grab what you can

1661
01:48:02,958 --> 01:48:10,958
Find a fix, find a quick fix

1662
01:48:12,541 --> 01:48:17,267
Make a quick guess or hit bulls eye

1663
01:48:17,291 --> 01:48:22,082
Find a fix, find a quick fix

1664
01:48:22,458 --> 01:48:24,892
if you want to save yourself

1665
01:48:24,916 --> 01:48:27,267
if you want a future

1666
01:48:27,291 --> 01:48:29,707
From here and there, from anywhere

1667
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:31,726
Grab what you can

1668
01:48:31,750 --> 01:48:36,142
Find a fix, find a quick fix

1669
01:48:36,166 --> 01:48:38,540
I don't know how we will get the money.

1670
01:48:38,583 --> 01:48:40,415
We're getting deeper into this mess.

1671
01:48:40,458 --> 01:48:43,457
I don't understand why you
didn't tell the cops everything.

1672
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:46,017
Are you kidding?

1673
01:48:46,041 --> 01:48:47,874
The cops won't believe our story.

1674
01:48:48,291 --> 01:48:51,184
They suspect us
I was the one being chased.

1675
01:48:51,208 --> 01:48:53,957
The cops could lock us up for life!

1676
01:48:54,541 --> 01:48:55,559
And...

1677
01:48:55,583 --> 01:48:57,934
if my dad hears about it,
I'm dead for sure.

1678
01:48:57,958 --> 01:48:59,832
There has to be a solution.

1679
01:49:00,958 --> 01:49:02,040
Dude...

1680
01:49:04,583 --> 01:49:06,457
I wanted to tell you that...

1681
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:10,207
I had a dream last night.

1682
01:49:10,875 --> 01:49:12,374
Are you crazy?

1683
01:49:12,958 --> 01:49:15,101
Thanks to your dream we
are in this mess today.

1684
01:49:15,125 --> 01:49:18,332
Despite how my dad is,
he loves the restaurant...

1685
01:49:18,916 --> 01:49:21,790
and won't survive if he hears that
he has lost the restaurant to Bholi.

1686
01:49:22,750 --> 01:49:24,415
Took us for a ride... both of them.

1687
01:49:24,458 --> 01:49:26,976
Who asked you to follow
us to Bholi's place?

1688
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,851
You came on your own
blowing your own trumpet...

1689
01:49:28,875 --> 01:49:30,851
and handed over the deed to Bholi.

1690
01:49:30,875 --> 01:49:31,892
On top of that you're arguing,

1691
01:49:31,916 --> 01:49:32,976
after losing the pills.

1692
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,017
Why shouldn't I?

1693
01:49:34,041 --> 01:49:35,749
That's my shop at stake.

1694
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:38,184
'We win the lottery every time.'

1695
01:49:38,208 --> 01:49:39,124
What happened this time?

1696
01:49:39,166 --> 01:49:40,226
I'll break your face.

1697
01:49:40,250 --> 01:49:41,082
Shut up Choocha!

1698
01:49:41,125 --> 01:49:42,665
Dude... it was my mistake.

1699
01:49:42,708 --> 01:49:44,040
We are in this mess thanks to me.

1700
01:49:46,708 --> 01:49:50,165
That night,
I couldn't sleep thinking about the riches.

1701
01:49:50,958 --> 01:49:54,124
All of you fell asleep and
I was awake all night like an owl.

1702
01:49:54,791 --> 01:49:58,540
I pretended to be asleep
next morning fearing Hunny...

1703
01:49:58,583 --> 01:50:03,374
cooked up a dream
and that's why the number didn't click.

1704
01:50:03,416 --> 01:50:05,184
Why didn't you open your mouth then?

1705
01:50:05,208 --> 01:50:06,874
We would've requested
Bholi for more time.

1706
01:50:06,916 --> 01:50:09,374
Sorry, I was afraid.
I goofed up.

1707
01:50:09,416 --> 01:50:11,392
But this dream is real...

1708
01:50:11,416 --> 01:50:13,059
and Hunny's formula is rock solid too.

1709
01:50:13,083 --> 01:50:15,540
It's no use accepting your goof up now.

1710
01:50:15,583 --> 01:50:16,767
It's useless even if it's real.

1711
01:50:16,791 --> 01:50:18,665
It's not useless.
Hunny and I have a record.

1712
01:50:18,708 --> 01:50:20,392
If it's a record,
you can play it all you want.

1713
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:21,767
Who will give the money?
Your pop?

1714
01:50:21,791 --> 01:50:22,499
Lali!

1715
01:50:22,541 --> 01:50:23,226
How much do you want?

1716
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:23,874
Neetu!

1717
01:50:23,916 --> 01:50:24,916
Neetu ma'am.

1718
01:50:28,625 --> 01:50:30,267
have you lost your mind?

1719
01:50:30,291 --> 01:50:32,559
Yesterday you were angry
at me and now you're getting into this.

1720
01:50:32,583 --> 01:50:34,851
Do you have any other option, Zafar?

1721
01:50:34,875 --> 01:50:37,017
If they are telling the truth,
perhaps it's possible that...

1722
01:50:37,041 --> 01:50:39,267
if and perhaps in
the same sentence, Neetu.

1723
01:50:39,291 --> 01:50:41,374
Do I need to say anything more?

1724
01:50:41,958 --> 01:50:44,665
Hunny, I've heard enough of your crap.

1725
01:50:44,708 --> 01:50:46,374
No more arguments, please.

1726
01:50:46,416 --> 01:50:51,101
Right, until yesterday all of this sounded
like music to your ears, now it's crap!

1727
01:50:51,125 --> 01:50:53,184
Yes, we all had our needs...

1728
01:50:53,208 --> 01:50:55,249
got carried away, especially me.

1729
01:50:55,875 --> 01:50:58,457
We got greedy, took a shortcut
and got involved with a hustler.

1730
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:00,184
Well, you suggested the hustler's name.

1731
01:51:00,208 --> 01:51:01,726
Perhaps you are hand in glove with her.

1732
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:02,851
That's enough!

1733
01:51:02,875 --> 01:51:05,540
Zafar... Lali... Neetu madam...

1734
01:51:05,916 --> 01:51:07,707
for once please believe
what I'm saying.

1735
01:51:07,750 --> 01:51:08,892
I swear on my mother.

1736
01:51:08,916 --> 01:51:11,999
We are failures when it comes to studies,
but never with the lottery.

1737
01:51:33,625 --> 01:51:35,874
So, what was your dream?

1738
01:51:39,208 --> 01:51:39,999
Say it.

1739
01:51:40,041 --> 01:51:41,332
Lali, what are you doing?

1740
01:51:49,208 --> 01:51:51,415
Fine, you can do as you wish!

1741
01:51:51,458 --> 01:51:52,934
Count me out, thank you.

1742
01:51:52,958 --> 01:51:56,207
Zafar...

1743
01:51:59,708 --> 01:52:00,749
Never mind him...

1744
01:52:03,583 --> 01:52:04,707
you carry on.

1745
01:52:12,791 --> 01:52:15,851
Don't get angry on hearing it.

1746
01:52:15,875 --> 01:52:17,499
Come on already!

1747
01:52:17,541 --> 01:52:18,541
Okay.

1748
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:27,267
I saw that, while chasing a falling kite,
a mad dog bites you.

1749
01:52:27,291 --> 01:52:30,415
Then you start barking like that mad dog...

1750
01:52:30,458 --> 01:52:34,476
and go around in circles
chasing your own tail.

1751
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:38,749
Somehow I get there and
as the mad dog jumps at you...

1752
01:52:39,041 --> 01:52:42,457
I send it flying with a kick.

1753
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:47,707
Then I lift the other mad dog,
that is you, up in my arms...

1754
01:52:48,083 --> 01:52:52,059
and in slow motion I take you
to the veterinarian.

1755
01:52:52,083 --> 01:52:54,915
You take a liking to me and...

1756
01:52:54,958 --> 01:52:58,749
keep licking my face all
along the way.

1757
01:52:59,458 --> 01:53:05,184
The veterinarian pierces
you with big injections...

1758
01:53:05,208 --> 01:53:08,499
transforming you into
my friend Hunny again.

1759
01:53:12,666 --> 01:53:16,267
Choocha,
you actually dream these things?

1760
01:53:16,291 --> 01:53:17,832
Or always cook them up?

1761
01:53:18,458 --> 01:53:21,226
I mean, I'm the one who's
getting screwed every time.

1762
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:23,624
Except for the last one,
all dreams are real.

1763
01:53:23,666 --> 01:53:24,832
I swear.

1764
01:53:25,166 --> 01:53:26,332
Of course.

1765
01:53:26,375 --> 01:53:29,582
It's better to be hounded
by Bholi than to have a friend like you.

1766
01:53:30,791 --> 01:53:32,101
Don't say that.

1767
01:53:32,125 --> 01:53:33,749
A friend in need is a friend indeed.

1768
01:53:33,791 --> 01:53:36,665
Don't I always save you in the dreams?

1769
01:53:37,666 --> 01:53:40,707
Dude, if you're through with the reunion,
can we decode the number?

1770
01:53:49,666 --> 01:53:51,540
Number!

1771
01:53:55,166 --> 01:53:58,665
Dog...

1772
01:53:59,208 --> 01:54:01,374
A dog bit...

1773
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:03,540
with his teeth.

1774
01:54:04,208 --> 01:54:07,915
And a dog has 32 teeth.

1775
01:54:08,541 --> 01:54:10,415
3 plus 2 makes 5.

1776
01:54:10,916 --> 01:54:14,999
When a dog bites...

1777
01:54:15,541 --> 01:54:18,017
you get 14 injections.

1778
01:54:18,041 --> 01:54:20,267
1 plus 4 is also 5.

1779
01:54:20,291 --> 01:54:21,665
The number is five.

1780
01:54:26,375 --> 01:54:27,999
What colour was the dog?

1781
01:54:29,791 --> 01:54:31,207
You or the mad dog that bit you?

1782
01:54:34,041 --> 01:54:35,041
Black.

1783
01:54:38,166 --> 01:54:39,540
Black dog...

1784
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:46,040
Black dog is...

1785
01:54:47,291 --> 01:54:48,790
Bhairo Baba's pet.

1786
01:54:48,833 --> 01:54:52,207
And Bhairo Baba's temple
is behind the old fort.

1787
01:54:52,958 --> 01:54:55,040
The old fort is in Delhi and...

1788
01:54:57,250 --> 01:54:59,707
Delhi's old name is...

1789
01:55:01,916 --> 01:55:03,582
lndraprastha.

1790
01:55:07,750 --> 01:55:09,457
Indraprastha lottery number five!

1791
01:55:10,375 --> 01:55:12,851
We got the number,
what about the money?

1792
01:55:12,875 --> 01:55:14,082
I can help you with some.

1793
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,707
My savings and other investments
add up to about 300,000.

1794
01:55:19,750 --> 01:55:22,226
125,000 is for Zafar's dad's treatment...

1795
01:55:22,250 --> 01:55:24,165
You can use the rest, if it helps.

1796
01:55:24,958 --> 01:55:27,749
What about Zafar?

1797
01:55:29,125 --> 01:55:30,457
Zafar is not ready to listen.

1798
01:55:39,291 --> 01:55:42,040
Well, we need more money...

1799
01:55:42,083 --> 01:55:45,124
I can manage some
but we'll still fall short.

1800
01:55:45,833 --> 01:55:48,707
I will get the rest.

1801
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:50,499
No, Lali, your restaurant is already...

1802
01:55:50,541 --> 01:55:55,249
Precisely why I have to see this through.

1803
01:56:19,666 --> 01:56:22,290
And what plans do we have?

1804
01:56:36,541 --> 01:56:37,541
Hello?

1805
01:56:39,416 --> 01:56:40,457
Who is it?

1806
01:56:41,833 --> 01:56:43,665
My mother!

1807
01:56:43,708 --> 01:56:45,082
Hail thee!

1808
01:56:51,916 --> 01:56:56,832
The Mother Goddess has called on me
from the temple

1809
01:57:05,083 --> 01:57:07,790
Hey... you better stop laughing, okay?

1810
01:57:07,833 --> 01:57:09,892
We're artists renowned for our art.

1811
01:57:09,916 --> 01:57:10,892
Our art is priceless.

1812
01:57:10,916 --> 01:57:12,832
Sure, if you say so!

1813
01:57:12,875 --> 01:57:14,624
Both of you do look cute.

1814
01:57:14,666 --> 01:57:15,582
I'm going in now...

1815
01:57:15,625 --> 01:57:17,249
don't want to miss your entry.

1816
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:21,540
Dude, what's down there?

1817
01:57:22,083 --> 01:57:22,832
Where?

1818
01:57:22,875 --> 01:57:23,207
Dude!

1819
01:57:23,666 --> 01:57:27,332
Hail the Goddess of the lions

1820
01:57:27,375 --> 01:57:35,375
Long live your reign

1821
01:57:38,291 --> 01:57:41,165
Always be praised

1822
01:57:49,416 --> 01:57:52,540
if I was the lion of your temple

1823
01:57:53,375 --> 01:57:54,749
That's our cue.

1824
01:58:01,041 --> 01:58:02,059
All the best, dude!

1825
01:58:02,083 --> 01:58:05,999
I would take you on my back
and through the jungle

1826
01:58:06,041 --> 01:58:10,415
I would be blessed by you every day

1827
01:58:10,625 --> 01:58:18,625
if I was the lion of your temple

1828
01:58:43,083 --> 01:58:51,083
if I was the peacock in your garden

1829
01:59:12,041 --> 01:59:15,332
The peacock in your garden,
if I was the peacock in your garden.

1830
01:59:18,083 --> 01:59:22,499
If I was the peacock in your garden

1831
01:59:25,291 --> 01:59:26,707
Where the hell is Choocha?

1832
01:59:32,125 --> 01:59:37,457
If I was the peacock in your garden

1833
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:00,934
The entire amount for what?

1834
02:00:00,958 --> 02:00:02,665
Last time he didn't perform.

1835
02:00:02,708 --> 02:00:04,226
Today you ruined the costume.

1836
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:05,601
Won't I take it out of your money?

1837
02:00:05,625 --> 02:00:08,892
What about the trouble I went through?

1838
02:00:08,916 --> 02:00:12,976
By God, Pradhan, I've seen enough swindlers
but you beat them all.

1839
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,726
You're taking advantage of our innocence,
aren't you?

1840
02:00:14,750 --> 02:00:16,374
Innocence, my foot!

1841
02:00:18,208 --> 02:00:20,290
Hello... Lali...

1842
02:00:21,416 --> 02:00:24,601
We didn't get as much as we expected...

1843
02:00:24,625 --> 02:00:28,999
I'll try and figure some other way,
but I suggest you push a little harder too.

1844
02:00:43,958 --> 02:00:47,226
Dear God, I don't know what's going
to happen today...

1845
02:00:47,250 --> 02:00:48,540
or how it will finally unfold...

1846
02:00:48,583 --> 02:00:50,332
I leave it all up to you.

1847
02:00:50,375 --> 02:00:51,892
Please, get us through.

1848
02:00:51,916 --> 02:00:53,749
You know what's best for us.

1849
02:00:53,791 --> 02:00:56,540
Just get us out of this mess, please!

1850
02:01:17,083 --> 02:01:19,124
Brother, the dopehead ran away
with the petrol tank.

1851
02:01:22,375 --> 02:01:24,457
Thank you sir, which way did he go?

1852
02:01:24,708 --> 02:01:26,290
No man, I don't eat non-veg food.

1853
02:01:41,208 --> 02:01:42,208
Where is he?

1854
02:02:10,625 --> 02:02:13,226
Bloody dopehead,
I won't spare you today!

1855
02:02:13,250 --> 02:02:14,957
Why are you after my motorcycle?

1856
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,582
Whoa, take it easy.
What have I done?

1857
02:02:17,625 --> 02:02:20,184
This fuel tank is from
your aircraft, is it?

1858
02:02:20,208 --> 02:02:21,582
What have I done?

1859
02:02:21,625 --> 02:02:24,059
If it's not mine, is it yours?

1860
02:02:24,083 --> 02:02:25,957
On your feet, you jerk!

1861
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,101
Time to take you to the cops.

1862
02:02:28,125 --> 02:02:29,999
Then we will know whose tank it is!

1863
02:02:30,041 --> 02:02:32,332
Fine, let's go.
You think I'm afraid?

1864
02:02:32,916 --> 02:02:34,124
I'm not a loser.

1865
02:02:34,666 --> 02:02:36,874
I can buy the cops at
the snap of my fingers.

1866
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:40,624
My pockets are overflowing with money.

1867
02:02:40,916 --> 02:02:44,290
Look at this take a good look...

1868
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:47,500
What?!

1869
02:02:48,208 --> 02:02:50,749
Never seen so much money
in one go, have you?

1870
02:02:51,416 --> 02:02:53,165
Dumbstruck, aren't you?

1871
02:02:54,833 --> 02:02:56,332
How come you have all this money?

1872
02:02:56,375 --> 02:02:58,892
Remember I had told you...

1873
02:02:58,916 --> 02:03:00,790
my money is gathering dust.

1874
02:03:01,375 --> 02:03:03,476
I have 12 shops in Gandhinagar...

1875
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:04,749
all leased out.

1876
02:03:05,250 --> 02:03:07,290
I even file my income tax returns.

1877
02:03:07,958 --> 02:03:09,707
All my wealth is white...

1878
02:03:10,708 --> 02:03:12,374
only my deeds are black.

1879
02:03:14,208 --> 02:03:16,165
What will you do with this money?

1880
02:03:16,208 --> 02:03:18,415
I'll make paper boats and
leave them in the sewer...

1881
02:03:18,458 --> 02:03:19,458
you've got a problem?

1882
02:03:24,083 --> 02:03:26,915
What if I double your money
in a few hours?

1883
02:03:30,458 --> 02:03:31,458
What do you say?

1884
02:03:32,750 --> 02:03:33,832
Sardarji...

1885
02:03:34,458 --> 02:03:36,374
are you high on something too?

1886
02:03:36,416 --> 02:03:38,249
Shut up!
Or I'll slap you hard!

1887
02:03:39,875 --> 02:03:41,475
I'm not taking your money for nothing...

1888
02:03:42,666 --> 02:03:44,915
you can have my motorcycle as collateral.

1889
02:03:51,791 --> 02:03:53,957
Alright, you can have it.

1890
02:03:55,416 --> 02:03:57,207
Keep your motorcycle too.

1891
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:01,415
Meet me at the
temple near the river after 4 pm.

1892
02:04:02,125 --> 02:04:03,624
To hell with double.

1893
02:04:03,666 --> 02:04:06,207
Bring back what you take.

1894
02:04:06,958 --> 02:04:09,665
Not like I can take all
this with me when I die.

1895
02:04:10,125 --> 02:04:12,040
Here you go.

1896
02:04:14,458 --> 02:04:16,040
And don't forget the petrol tank.

1897
02:04:19,291 --> 02:04:20,571
Guess what, I found some more...

1898
02:04:23,250 --> 02:04:24,499
keep this as well.

1899
02:04:27,458 --> 02:04:30,540
Loafers, wasters, bums,

1900
02:04:30,791 --> 02:04:34,059
A ghost ran away with your underpants...
get under a blanket and hide

1901
02:04:34,083 --> 02:04:37,165
Loafers, wasters, bums,

1902
02:04:37,416 --> 02:04:40,684
A ghost ran away with your underpants...
get under a blanket and hide

1903
02:04:40,708 --> 02:04:48,708
fuk fuk fuk fuk

1904
02:04:53,958 --> 02:04:57,184
We're fortunate we're bums.
We've got dreams in our eyes.

1905
02:04:57,208 --> 02:05:00,540
Every dream is worth a hundred billion,
studded with diamonds and pearls

1906
02:05:00,583 --> 02:05:03,892
In the durbars of Delhi, there
are many who think they're princes.

1907
02:05:03,916 --> 02:05:07,142
One look at us and they
wet the ground they stand on.

1908
02:05:07,166 --> 02:05:10,415
We eat, we forget, we hit and we run.
Out of our way!

1909
02:05:10,458 --> 02:05:13,540
Loafers, wasters, bums,

1910
02:05:13,791 --> 02:05:17,059
A ghost ran away with your underpants
get under a blanket and hide

1911
02:05:17,083 --> 02:05:20,165
Loafers, wasters, bums,

1912
02:05:20,416 --> 02:05:23,707
A ghost ran away with your underpants
get under a blanket and hide

1913
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:31,750
fuk fuk fuk fuk

1914
02:05:36,958 --> 02:05:40,184
Booze, weed, grass just one hit

1915
02:05:40,208 --> 02:05:43,457
Out comes the smoke
and all the trouble are gone

1916
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:46,767
Kneel before God, ring the temple bell

1917
02:05:46,791 --> 02:05:50,184
1, 2, 3, 4, I want kisses over and over

1918
02:05:50,208 --> 02:05:53,457
5, 6, 7, 8, at night we'll go to lndia Gate

1919
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:56,582
Loafers, wasters, bums,

1920
02:05:56,833 --> 02:06:00,101
A ghost ran away with your underpants
get under a blanket and hide

1921
02:06:00,125 --> 02:06:03,207
Loafers, wasters, bums,

1922
02:06:03,458 --> 02:06:06,749
A ghost ran away with your underpants
get under a blanket and hide

1923
02:06:20,208 --> 02:06:22,999
Hello Zafar we won the jackpot!

1924
02:06:37,166 --> 02:06:39,267
Impressive.

1925
02:06:39,291 --> 02:06:42,124
You all are bunch of scoundrels,
including your coach.

1926
02:06:43,208 --> 02:06:45,790
Managed 2.5 million in one day!

1927
02:06:45,833 --> 02:06:48,226
You sure you haven't printed
these notes yourself?

1928
02:06:48,250 --> 02:06:50,790
Madam, you can take your own time
and check each one!

1929
02:06:50,833 --> 02:06:52,415
Smartass!

1930
02:06:52,458 --> 02:06:54,642
One sniff and I'll know
which ones are fake.

1931
02:06:54,666 --> 02:06:55,666
Get it?

1932
02:06:56,166 --> 02:06:58,540
I had some other plans for you.

1933
02:06:58,583 --> 02:07:00,184
I thought I'd give you a hard time.

1934
02:07:00,208 --> 02:07:02,184
Qet you to do some more work...

1935
02:07:02,208 --> 02:07:04,267
Nevermind.

1936
02:07:04,291 --> 02:07:05,291
Dismissed!

1937
02:07:11,583 --> 02:07:13,726
Yes, what's the matter?

1938
02:07:13,750 --> 02:07:15,101
Why are you still here?

1939
02:07:15,125 --> 02:07:16,665
Waiting for my wedding?

1940
02:07:16,708 --> 02:07:19,059
Madam, go ahead, give us a hard time,
get more work done...

1941
02:07:19,083 --> 02:07:21,749
It's not like we are waiting
to click pictures with you.

1942
02:07:21,791 --> 02:07:23,582
This covers the payment for the job done.

1943
02:07:23,625 --> 02:07:25,249
What say we do this again?

1944
02:07:26,083 --> 02:07:27,083
What?

1945
02:07:34,625 --> 02:07:37,267
Here's 700,000 advance...

1946
02:07:37,291 --> 02:07:38,624
got any more pills?

1947
02:07:40,500 --> 02:07:43,124
Once a scoundrel,
always a scoundrel!

1948
02:07:44,666 --> 02:07:46,040
What do you say, coach?

1949
02:07:47,791 --> 02:07:49,582
I say, go for it.

1950
02:07:49,625 --> 02:07:50,707
Really?

1951
02:07:53,375 --> 02:07:54,559
Where will you sell them?

1952
02:07:54,583 --> 02:07:58,082
Just give us the stuff.
We'll figure how and where to set up shop.

1953
02:08:02,083 --> 02:08:03,790
Brilliant!

1954
02:08:03,833 --> 02:08:06,415
I'll make sure I'm there
for your opening night.

1955
02:08:08,166 --> 02:08:10,207
I'll give pills for a million.
Make the most of it.

1956
02:08:37,291 --> 02:08:38,291
Let's go.

1957
02:08:47,875 --> 02:08:52,790
Loafers, O Loafers,
your luck is so messed up

1958
02:08:53,375 --> 02:08:58,999
Even your shoes are in tatters

1959
02:08:59,958 --> 02:09:02,540
Your luck is so messed up.

1960
02:09:57,375 --> 02:10:00,457
Loafers, wasters, bums,

1961
02:10:00,708 --> 02:10:02,790
A ghost ran away with your underpants

1962
02:10:04,666 --> 02:10:07,415
Hello Zafar we won the jackpot!

1963
02:10:14,875 --> 02:10:18,249
Neetu, bring everyone over
to the police station.

1964
02:10:20,083 --> 02:10:21,083
What?

1965
02:10:21,208 --> 02:10:22,874
What happened that day, sardarji?

1966
02:10:24,791 --> 02:10:27,290
Sir, we were afraid you wouldn't
believe us.

1967
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:30,915
We only wanted to return
the money and leave.

1968
02:10:32,458 --> 02:10:34,082
What if I still don't believe you?

1969
02:10:39,250 --> 02:10:40,540
Sir...

1970
02:10:41,416 --> 02:10:44,184
Zafar is as innocent as a cow...

1971
02:10:44,208 --> 02:10:45,208
an artist.

1972
02:10:45,791 --> 02:10:48,249
Lali here... is a saint.

1973
02:10:51,791 --> 02:10:55,249
Every bad deed possible
we've had our hand in it.

1974
02:10:56,208 --> 02:10:59,415
Sir, we tried selling those pills
because we needed money.

1975
02:10:59,458 --> 02:11:01,790
Never realised that we were selling poison.

1976
02:11:02,666 --> 02:11:05,957
It was fortunate that
you raided the party...

1977
02:11:06,791 --> 02:11:10,624
and those pills went down the gutter
instead of somebody's blood-stream.

1978
02:11:11,375 --> 02:11:12,375
Sir...

1979
02:11:13,875 --> 02:11:16,124
please think about Zafar's plan.

1980
02:11:17,041 --> 02:11:20,207
You'll get what you want and
we'll be even with Bholi.

1981
02:11:24,583 --> 02:11:25,874
If you...

1982
02:11:27,625 --> 02:11:29,040
still feel...

1983
02:11:43,458 --> 02:11:44,458
Okay.

1984
02:11:47,666 --> 02:11:49,124
She won't refuse your offer.

1985
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,457
She's always looking
for scapegoats like you.

1986
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:54,999
To sell her stuff.

1987
02:11:55,791 --> 02:11:57,499
It's great if her stuff sells...

1988
02:11:57,541 --> 02:11:58,790
and if it's confiscated...

1989
02:11:59,500 --> 02:12:01,976
she has her moles in the
police department...

1990
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,540
who give her stuff back to her.

1991
02:12:04,750 --> 02:12:07,790
But it's guys like you
who get mired in her plans.

1992
02:12:11,583 --> 02:12:13,082
Make sure, she doesn't suspect you.

1993
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,017
Thank you, sir.

1994
02:12:19,041 --> 02:12:21,540
We won't give up the money...

1995
02:12:21,583 --> 02:12:23,332
moreover, we deserve a reward...

1996
02:12:23,375 --> 02:12:26,207
and to be part of the Republic day parade.

1997
02:12:28,416 --> 02:12:30,999
Hello... May day... May day... Ready!

1998
02:12:32,916 --> 02:12:35,415
Sir, what if you get delayed?

1999
02:12:35,458 --> 02:12:39,226
What if your binoculars are hazy
or car tyre is punctured...

2000
02:12:39,250 --> 02:12:41,915
or your mother calls you back home.

2001
02:12:41,958 --> 02:12:43,790
Or what if a traffic cop stops you...

2002
02:12:44,708 --> 02:12:50,832
Let there be a country of loafers
and make me the President.

2003
02:12:51,291 --> 02:12:54,582
Sing with me now, brothers and sisters.

2004
02:12:54,625 --> 02:12:57,934
1,2,3,4, Long live the Loafers Party!!

2005
02:12:57,958 --> 02:13:01,184
5, 6, 7, 8, Death to all the smarty pants

2006
02:13:01,208 --> 02:13:04,267
Loafers, wasters, bums,

2007
02:13:04,291 --> 02:13:06,165
A ghost ran away with your underpants

2008
02:15:08,500 --> 02:15:10,790
Hunny, I love you too!

2009
02:15:26,875 --> 02:15:28,142
We have won the lottery!

2010
02:15:28,166 --> 02:15:31,582
The locks have all opened,
we have won the lottery

2011
02:15:31,625 --> 02:15:35,142
Thank you God,
we have won the lottery

2012
02:15:35,166 --> 02:15:38,624
We have got all we desired,
we have won the lottery

2013
02:15:38,666 --> 02:15:42,540
Happy days are here,
we have won the lottery

2014
02:15:42,583 --> 02:15:46,101
We have to make a noise

2015
02:15:46,125 --> 02:15:49,582
How can we not make a noise?

2016
02:15:49,625 --> 02:15:52,684
Let the party begin

2017
02:15:52,708 --> 02:15:56,142
Say it loud, we have won the lottery

2018
02:15:56,166 --> 02:15:59,540
Throw your hands up in the air now,

Like you just don't care now,

Sing it LO TT ERY,

2022
02:16:17,666 --> 02:16:19,374
Who doesn't understand me

2023
02:16:19,416 --> 02:16:21,142
Who thought I was no one special

2024
02:16:21,166 --> 02:16:24,249
It is their mistake

2025
02:16:24,666 --> 02:16:26,374
My life is a hit

2026
02:16:26,416 --> 02:16:28,142
My future is fit

2027
02:16:28,166 --> 02:16:31,624
Everything is cool

2028
02:16:31,666 --> 02:16:35,142
We have to make a noise

2029
02:16:35,166 --> 02:16:38,624
How can we not make a noise?

2030
02:16:38,666 --> 02:16:41,726

Forget the profanities of the world

2037
02:17:19,416 --> 02:17:22,665
Talk of love

2038
02:17:22,916 --> 02:17:27,142
Talk of love, my love

2039
02:17:27,166 --> 02:17:33,642
I will die of happiness

2040
02:17:33,666 --> 02:17:36,892
if you love me for even a moment

2041
02:17:36,916 --> 02:17:41,165
if you love me for even a moment,
my friend

2042
02:17:41,750 --> 02:17:43,499
Whose job is to love

2043
02:17:43,541 --> 02:17:45,267
To put colour in life

2044
02:17:45,291 --> 02:17:48,290
That heart is a dude

2045
02:17:48,791 --> 02:17:50,499
Live and let live

2046
02:17:50,541 --> 02:17:52,332
In this world

2047
