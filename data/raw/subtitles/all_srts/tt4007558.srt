2
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:35,454
This story begins
as all stories begin.

3
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,727
It was a dark and stormy night.

4
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,122
Lightning streaked the sky.

5
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,888
The clouds rumbled ominously.

6
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,433
And a man named Bipin...

7
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,102
was coming home
with a little orphan.

8
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,775
Bipin lived with his
termagant of a mother.

9
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,248
And his wife who was
even more of a terror.

10
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,715
In her world,
every relationship was a deal.

11
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,856
Her world was a marketplace.

12
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:16,196
And in her marketplace, a child with
no antecedents counted for nothing.

13
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:23,265
Bipin's mother and wife rejected
the child at first glance.

14
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,145
But thanks to her survival instinct...

15
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,382
the little one would not be budged.

16
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,983
- Alert! Alert!

17
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,448
- Danger!

18
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:36,807
Bipin never told anyone where the girl
came from or why he brought her home.

19
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,551
Never. And the termagants
asked quite often.

20
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,271
One day, Bipin found out...

21
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,782
that his motherless
tyke was a baby owl.

22
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,217
Her friends were bats.

23
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,190
He tried everything he could...

24
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:25,387
but he could not get her to sleep,
perchance to dream.

25
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,090
She stayed awake all night.

26
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,931
But all day, she was awake too.

27
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,705
But Bipin was not one to give up.

28
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:41,135
One day, he gave his princess a box.

29
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,642
It was a dream box.

30
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:44,405
Dreams?

31
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,676
Every day, he drew her a new dream,
just for her.

32
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:54,218
All this in the forlorn hope that
his princess would one day sleep...

33
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:55,926
and learn the joy of dreaming.

34
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:03,158
But every princess needs a prince
to coax her to the Land of Nod.

35
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:26,690
"Riding a whim, I'm on my way..."

36
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:34,595
"We were meant to meet,
some day, some way..."

37
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:42,468
"Riding a whim, I'm on my way..."

38
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:50,110
"We were meant to meet,
some day, some way..."

39
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:57,986
"Riding a whim, I'm on my way..."

40
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,856
Who is this numbskull'?

41
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,873
Sorry, Daddy-O, I'm...

42
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,871
What d'you mean 'sorry'?
Can't you look where you're going?

43
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,603
Blind turn back there, right'?
Didn't see it.

44
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,374
You aren't blind, are you'?

45
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,216
I said, sorry, innit'?

46
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,387
Hey, blind bat,
what are you looking at'?

47
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,248
Look at me and talk.

48
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,650
You didn't see my car when you had to.
Now look at me and talk.

49
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,727
Yo, I said sorry three times.

50
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,086
What more do you want'?

51
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:41,863
C'mon give one back.

52
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,162
What'?

53
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,129
Return a sorry.

54
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:44,734
What'?

55
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:48,497
Until you return
one of my 'sorries', I won't move.

56
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,931
Who returns apologies?

57
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:54,545
You do. Give one back or I stay put.

58
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,144
- I've dealt with his kind before.

59
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,448
- Stay in the car.
- Let me deal with this.

60
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:13,394
Get this bike out of the way.

61
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,599
Won't. Whatcher gonna do about it'?

62
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,866
- Hey.
- Hey-e'!

63
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,229
<i>- Hey-ey-e'!
- Hey-eV-QWQV.</i>

64
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:22,569
You wanna make something of this'?

65
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,139
Do you know who I am'?

66
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:25,634
Who are you'?

67
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,475
Why would I tell you'?

68
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,144
Do you know who I am'?

69
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,611
Why would I want to know?

70
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,380
Bipin!

71
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,848
Bipin? Who's the hot broad'?

72
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,013
Down, boy.

73
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:45,291
Geetu, wait in the car.
Let me handle this.

74
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:48,627
Where are you going, Eesha'?

75
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,495
- To help?
- But Eesha...

76
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:51,766
Can I help?

77
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,734
Eesha, it's okay.
<i>I'll</i> manage. Wait in the car.

78
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,204
Hey, Eesha!

79
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:57,636
Hi.

80
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:58,772
Hey!

81
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:43,513
Wow!!

82
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,246
Triumph Thunderbird Storm,

83
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,681
270 degree firing interval.

84
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,359
Really? I thought it was 250 degrees.

85
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,222
270, Beeps. Parallel Twin.

86
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,954
You know so much about so much.

87
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,565
Interested in bikes, are ya'?

88
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,733
In everything.

89
00:10:59,025 --> 00:10:59,662
Alia.

90
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,897
Ooh la la. Alia.
Jagjinder Joginder.

91
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,537
- Who is this'?
- It's me, sir.

92
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,776
So you had to tell me in the end.

93
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,844
Whatever, dude.
Look, lemme move my belly-shover.

94
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,847
That's right, move it along.
You lot, get in the car.

95
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,084
You, get that out of the way.

96
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,917
One sorry on your account, Daddy-O.

97
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:16,745
Move!

98
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,754
Love you too!

99
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,031
It's a fairy-castle!

100
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,360
It's beautiful!

101
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,707
Are you happy, kiddo?

102
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,772
Yes Dad, it's perfect!

103
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,711
Why wouldn't it be'?
Mummyji has paid for it.

104
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,582
And now if you're done with
your little lovefest, can we go in'?

105
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,315
Mummyji will be waiting.

106
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,916
My picture small?

107
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,252
That small?

108
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,489
That small?

109
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,129
OMG!

110
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,764
This is like K3G!

111
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:38,992
Totally!

112
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,704
<i>Hi, Ria, Pia.</i>

113
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,166
- Hi, FTB.
- Hi, FTB.

114
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,635
Oh sorry... FTB?

115
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,139
- Father of the bride!
- Father of the bride!

116
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,206
Father of the bride is in trouble.

117
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:52,582
Why is my photograph so
small on this magazine cover'?

118
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,010
Give me answers!

119
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,510
Tell her, no'?

120
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,177
I want answers!

121
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:02,686
- Bipin will know, Mummyji.
- Where is he'? Get him here. Now.

122
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,854
I've emptied my pockets
for this wedding and this ingrate...

123
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,325
- They're right when they say...

124
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,029
If you meet a snake and an
Arora on the road, kill the Arora.

125
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,966
Mummyji, you're also an Arora.

126
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,101
Straighten that pink paw.

127
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,004
You should have been
squished out at birth.

128
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:25,542
Snakelet!

129
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:27,842
<i>Yes, Mummy.</i>

130
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,280
Snake in my bosom!

131
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:31,616
<i>Yes, Mummy.</i>

132
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:32,617
Cobra.

133
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,587
<i>Yes, Mummy.</i>

134
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,384
What do they call that snake,
which coils about you and kills you'?

135
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:38,856
A boa constrictor, Mummyji.

136
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,293
Boa!

137
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:47,826
Bipin! Thank God!
Bipin, where are Eesha and Alia'?

138
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,097
Waiting for you.

139
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,635
Bipin, you should know...

140
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:51,840
- What?
- Take it off.

141
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,067
Take what off'?

142
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,074
Your shades.

143
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,412
Bye, Mummyji.

144
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,549
Good morning!

145
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,308
Where were you'?

146
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,213
I've been waiting for you forever.

147
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:10,456
Look at this magazine. Why
is Fundwani's photo bigger than mine'?

148
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,022
Fundwani paid for the photo.
We paid for the article.

149
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,727
But now we'll all be one big happy
family so what's the difference, Nlummyji'?

150
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:21,098
It makes a difference! I don't care
if he's paid for the entire magazine.

151
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,896
Who's paying for this wedding?

152
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,375
You are, Mummyji. Who else can'?

153
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,410
Explain that to him.

154
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:35,344
Why do you think I've
brought that fatso up'?

155
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:40,589
When you sacrifice the goat,
you eat the meat.

156
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,922
- Come on... come on...

157
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,425
Come on, BTB! BTB!

158
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,595
BTB!

159
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,631
Deep breaths, deep breaths...

160
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,593
What is BTB'?

161
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:51,961
- Come on!
- Bride-to-be!

162
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,166
- Breathe in... breathe in.

163
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,907
I can't. You've cut
it way too small, Uncle.

164
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,609
Shut your face. I opened it out
four inches in Delhi and then it fit.

165
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,835
But now you've come
here and swelled up again.

166
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,347
This is a brilliant
sketch of your Robin.

167
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:07,741
Very nice.

168
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,749
Thanks.

169
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,743
They' re for Eesha.

170
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,014
- You can do it.

171
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,684
Try the upper hooks.

172
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,455
- Hi baby.
- Hi Mama.

173
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:18,320
Say no.

174
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,520
Do you know?

175
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:25,630
The average chocolate has
the legs of eight insects in it.

176
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:26,969
Eight!

177
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,805
As they make the chocolate,
the bug feet fall in.

178
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,334
This is no average chocolate, Alia.

179
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:34,306
It's a fact.

180
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,036
Have another one, after this, okay'?

181
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,205
How much are you going to stuff her'?

182
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,677
This won't fit her.

183
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,883
So what'? Make a new one.

184
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,719
This is one of my best, okay'?

185
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,924
Okay guys,
it's time for the breakfast rehearsal!

186
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,551
Breakfast rehearsal?

187
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:49,692
Mummyji is waiting.

188
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,657
Babla, who are you shooting?

189
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,554
Auntie Geetu.

190
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:53,228
No...

191
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,664
Boom... boom... boom.

192
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,095
Boom... boom... boom.

193
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,666
Eggs Benedict with Hollandaise,
caviar on omelette.

194
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:11,138
Eggs Benedict with Hollandaise,
caviar on omelette.

195
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:16,781
Beans on brisket,
eggs fried sunny side-up.

196
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:23,851
Sausages on the side,
hash browns and sun-dried tomatoes.

197
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,796
And my parathas?

198
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,201
And my parathas?

199
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,562
And my parathas?

200
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,807
Mummyji! Parathas, here?

201
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,468
Do you want me to starve to death'?

202
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,269
Who's going to make parathas here'?

203
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,307
Will an aaloo paratha work for you,
Kamlaji'?

204
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,115
And don't forget your
blood pressure medication.

205
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,785
Your pressure's been a bit high,
hasn't it'?

206
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,583
"What a hottie-hottie!"

207
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,219
"What a hottie-hottie!"

208
00:16:58,717 --> 00:16:59,286
"Yeah!"

209
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:00,093
You!

210
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,356
How are you, sir'?

211
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,329
This is Jagjinder Joginder
from Biji's.

212
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,362
Your friendly wedding organizer.

213
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,935
Up to now, you've been talking
to my CEO, Khushwant Kaur.

214
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:10,297
YOU!

215
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,200
You must be Eesha'?

216
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:13,742
The happy bride?

217
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,373
We've got Eggs Benedict for you.

218
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,705
- Thank you.
- Your favourite, right'?

219
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,113
- You!
- And you are'?

220
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:21,241
Ooh la la'?

221
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,413
Alia!

222
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,789
Ooh la la Alia. Of course.
Nice to meet you, Alia.

223
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:28,616
You?

224
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,259
What is this you-you-you'?
You whistling or something?

225
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,890
Not whistling,
Mummyji, it's just that he's who...

226
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,362
If you're through with
the you and the who...

227
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,559
“Ladies, are we ready
for the dance rehearsal?

228
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,863
Kamlaji, if you need anything,
just let me know.

229
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,406
- OMG.
- So hot.

230
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:45,698
Like, totally!

231
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,601
Great. Okay?

232
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,444
What are you up to'?

233
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,237
On the right, white flowers.

234
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,110
- Okay, JJ, we got it.
- Hey, Tenthouse.

235
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,113
How may I help you, sir'?

236
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,078
Who do you think you are'?

237
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,316
No one sir.
Just a creature. No special features.

238
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,154
Oh yeah'? And out there,
you were all muscles and machismo.

239
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,397
Outside, you were also a
different man, weren't you, Daddy-O'?

240
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:08,862
What do you mean?

241
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,500
Outdoors'? He roars!
In his house, he's a mouse.

242
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:15,000
So I changed as well.
Take it or leave it.

243
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,800
- Take what'?
- Hey JJ, check those flowers.

244
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,206
Perfect...

245
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:46,396
Hey!

246
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:50,472
A for apple, B for ball,
C for Come, D for Dance.

247
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:51,666
Bye.

248
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:57,546
Hey!

249
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,046
One... two... three... four...
five... six... seven... eight.

250
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,684
One... two... three... four...
five... six... seven... eight.

251
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:08,513
One... two... three... four...
five... six... seven... eight.

252
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:13,762
"I wanna be with you" - Come on, one... two...
three... four... five... six... seven... eight.

253
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,388
So much work.

254
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,763
Four... five... six... seven... eight.

255
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:06,309
Beeps.

256
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,515
Magnum 44.

257
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,483
Hey Vipul?

258
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,353
- Yes, Mummyji?
- I want one of those.

259
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:54,126
What'?

260
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,296
A gun!

261
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,687
I want to fire one too.
Before the wedding.

262
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:23,922
What, Mummyji'?

263
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,053
"This is the crazy..."

264
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,433
"This is the crazy..."

265
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,002
This is the crazy...

266
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:36,699
Life is a b*tch!

267
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:37,896
"This is the crazy..."

268
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,541
it's a beach, sir.

269
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,779
I am rich
All is well, all is well.

270
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:43,638
Come.

271
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,407
Welcome, sir.

272
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,977
You, Chinese?

273
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,844
<i>No, sir, Japanese.</i>

274
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:51,883
"This is the crazy..."

275
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,489
The Fundwanis are here.

276
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,247
"Crazy, man!"

277
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:03,427
Welcome! It is a pleasure
to do business with you, Mr. Fundwani.

278
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:08,104
This is the funtastic,
but Mummyji please call me the Harry.

279
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,804
This partnership is my pleasure...

280
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,737
for the whole Sindhi community,
pleasure, pleasure...

281
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:15,377
pleasure!

282
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,073
Funtastic family.

283
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,810
Welcome, welcome to the family.

284
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,076
We are already family.

285
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,514
Every Sindhi is the family.

286
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:28,315
The Harry,
may I tell you a custom of our family?

287
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:29,116
Sure.

288
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:32,285
On the happy occasion
of this wedding...

289
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:35,993
we would like to gift you
as much gold as Eesha's weight.

290
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:41,268
25,000 x 90 = Oh. My. God.

291
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,004
- Come fast, my bro!

292
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,975
"Robin, my bro, Robin!"

293
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,671
"Robin, my bro, Robin!"

294
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,183
"Robin, my bro, Robin!"

295
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,447
"Robin, my bro, Robin!"

296
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,547
"Robin, my bro!"

297
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,286
PP.

298
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,287
PP.

299
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:04,593
PP.

300
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,660
<i>PP, Mummy-ji.</i>

301
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:08,487
What is PP'?

302
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,891
'Pairi pauna' (I TOUCH YOUR FEET).

303
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,224
'Pairi pauna'!

304
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,733
Touch his feet.

305
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,130
Nice. Nice. Must buy this property.

306
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:22,742
Hey no flirting now.
You can do all that after marriage.

307
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,206
Marriage reminds me:
Is everything organized?

308
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:25,906
Yes, sir.

309
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:29,813
Karan is coming, isn't he'?
Hiroo simply insisted.

310
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,217
Hiroo'?

311
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,984
Are you the crazy'?
You don't know Hiroo Aunty'?

312
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,190
She's Karen's Mumma.

313
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,587
Oh Karan Johar.
Yes sir. He was inquiring after you.

314
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,123
- Really?
- Yeah.

315
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,425
Of course, of course. He's my fan,
my fan, y'know.

316
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,030
- All the rich people are my frands.
- All?

317
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:47,203
- And the rich people are all Sindhi.

318
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,869
- After all, I am the Chairman of
the UN Sindhi Association.

319
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:51,665
- Oh, UN'?

320
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,501
That's why we couldn't
have the wedding there.

321
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,268
Or we'd have to invite Lilibet, see'?

322
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,002
Too much publicity.
Don't like“.

323
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:57,873
Lilibet?

324
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,639
Queen Elizabeth'?

325
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,212
Queen Elizabeth'?

326
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,511
Queen Elizabeth!

327
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:03,446
Is she Sindhi too'?

328
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,315
Of course, she's Sindhi.

329
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,920
Her son's pushing sixty
but he still lives with her.

330
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,491
You're looking good.

331
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,331
I know.

332
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,903
The world's best people are Sindhis.

333
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,775
That explains this locket.

334
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,276
S for...'?

335
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,580
Let me guess. Let me guess.

336
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,348
S for Superman?

337
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:35,674
No!

338
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,052
One more chance.

339
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,017
S for Scarface.

340
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:42,591
Not at all!

341
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,493
Last chance.

342
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:48,594
S for Son-in-law?

343
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:52,735
No, ya loser, S for Sindhi.

344
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,997
The sunny Sindhi, the Sindhi as suns.

345
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:00,640
For me'?!

346
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,084
Come, come, come.

347
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:18,450
Baby doll!

348
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,407
Bipin, I love you!

349
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:33,539
What a welcome!

350
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,864
- How dare you touch my brother'?
- Sir...

351
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,871
- No, let it be. Don't want
to spoil the celebration.

352
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:25,474
Sir...

353
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,938
- I'm talking to you. Look at me.

354
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,577
- How did you dare'?
- Sir!

355
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,474
Hold on.
<i>I'll</i> look after this.

356
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:33,209
Hey you!

357
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:34,449
Won't you fight'?

358
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:35,741
- Talk to me.

359
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,011
Not for four hours after a work out.

360
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:37,949
- What you think of yourself?

361
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:38,883
Why'?

362
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,646
Your muscles tend to be tender, right!

363
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,053
- How did you dare'?!

364
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:43,919
That's my Dad.

365
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,485
You want to fight'?
Come.

366
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,253
Let it go.

367
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,031
What happened'?

368
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:50,090
Beeps.

369
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,766
Kiddo, you stay out of this.

370
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:55,101
Look, what you're doing is not right.

371
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,034
- What'?

372
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,265
- Hey!
- Let it be, brother.

373
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:58,372
Hey!!!

374
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:01,672
Dishoom!

375
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,179
What's happened'?
What's going on'?

376
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:11,714
Nothing, Daddy-O.

377
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:14,045
You lot enjoy yourself. I will resign.

378
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,188
You will do no such thing.

379
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,324
I said I would resign
and I will resign.

380
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,484
Who are you to resign?
We're going to sack you.

381
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,286
And who are you to sack him'?

382
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,329
Mummyji, he pushed me and I fell down.

383
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,000
No, Uncle, you...

384
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,964
Shut up.

385
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,472
Orphans shouldn't open their mouths.

386
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:32,369
- Mummyji, this man gave me a shove.

387
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,100
- He's had a drop too much.

388
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,272
- Mummyji, I warned you about this...

389
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,746
Mummyji, I withdraw my resignation.

390
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:43,244
I was going to come to you
to ask about tomorrows programme.

391
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:45,820
- Everyone, come and meet me.

392
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,820
I have something important to say.

393
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,858
- Mummyji, he was rude to Vinay.

394
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:52,959
He shoved him about.

395
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:56,031
If he had given you and
Vipul a couple of good ones,

396
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:57,525
I would have given him a bonus.

397
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,167
- You doofoids...

398
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:03,068
if JJ goes, this wedding stops.

399
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,073
And if the wedding doesn't happen,
you know what will happen?

400
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,173
If the wedding doesn't happen,
the business deal falls through.

401
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:10,275
Right.

402
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:16,416
She has more brains than
the three of you put together.

403
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:18,720
She is the only one
who can take my place.

404
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,254
I don't want your place.

405
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:22,084
Give your company to whom you want.

406
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,386
Give it to Vinay. Give it to Geetu.

407
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,558
But after this,
don't call Alia an orphan.

408
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:32,198
Ooh, did that bother you'?

409
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,402
I'm your mother.

410
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,533
Can't you do that much for me'?

411
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,606
Bear with it for a few days more.

412
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:44,246
You know we haven't
a red cent in the bank.

413
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:49,477
And under the Companies Act,
all of you are already bankrupt.

414
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,988
We've put the leavings
and scrapings into this deal.

415
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,985
If Fundwani breaks off the deal,

416
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,697
you'll spend the rest of
your lives paying off the debt.

417
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:07,796
So go.

418
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:10,632
Enjoy the wedding. Make it happen.

419
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:15,872
Your dream for tonight.

420
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:18,805
You're a fine one!

421
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,277
A bomb! Another bomb!

422
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,285
Is she dead'?

423
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,382
Not so easy.

424
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,751
We'll kill her slowly...

425
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,461
I was thinking.

426
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:36,564
We should put a time bomb
under her wheelchair.

427
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,295
Not a word to a living soul.

428
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,731
- You going to stay there all night?

429
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:48,607
Another bomb in the next room.
That one might go off any time.

430
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,717
Okay, these dreams that I give you'?

431
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,682
Do you save them up or
do you ever actually dream them'?

432
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:06,387
As soon as I get to sleep,
<i>I'll</i> dream them all.

433
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:07,658
Promise?

434
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,661
Promise.

435
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,033
If someone were to get you to sleep,
I'd be able to sleep well too.

436
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:34,117
Beeps, you know the visually
challenged can't see their dreams...

437
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,752
they only feel them.

438
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,957
Okay Miss Google.

439
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:41,486
Anything else'?

440
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,758
No, that's all for today.

441
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,390
<i>Is the class over'?</i>

442
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:48,802
Ting ding ding ding.

443
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,632
Okay, thank you, Miss.

444
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:58,777
Beeps...

445
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:01,643
let's just run away.

446
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,779
- I want to.

447
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,019
One day, we'll just take off.

448
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:11,720
Promise?

449
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,224
Promise!

450
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:32,574
"Ooooh, sleep eludes me."

451
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,577
"My heart deludes me."

452
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:41,255
"Someone comes a-creeping."

453
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,216
"And wakes the love that's sleeping."

454
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:49,991
"But <i>I'll</i> be up all night."

455
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:54,226
"My heart deludes me."

456
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,729
"Someone comes a-creeping."

457
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,202
"And wakes the love that's sleeping."

458
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:07,307
"But <i>I'll</i> be up all night."

459
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:14,821
Sonia?

460
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:19,925
Sonia?

461
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,766
- What?
- My bike keys, please?

462
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,234
- Can't sleep again?
- Yeah.

463
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,031
Where you off to'?

464
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,630
Nowhere particular.

465
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:35,169
In this darkness?

466
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,808
Hey, I'm not scared of the dark.

467
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:38,907
Boo!

468
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:42,413
Don't do that. Go to sleep.

469
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,750
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

470
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:49,724
"Ooooh, sleep eludes me."

471
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,193
"My heart deludes me."

472
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:58,291
"Someone comes a-creeping."

473
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,233
"And wakes the love that's sleeping."

474
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,198
Hey!

475
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,005
Hey... suicide...

476
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,234
Stop right there. Hey jumper...

477
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,364
<i>I'm on way. Oye, excuse me.</i>

478
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,429
Don't go under. Hang on.

479
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,264
Almost there. There, Gotcha.

480
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:40,806
You' re safe now.

481
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:43,741
Saved ya.

482
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,111
You?

483
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:47,747
What are you doing in my bathroom'?

484
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:50,579
I was saving you.

485
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:51,583
From what'?

486
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,946
From drowning.

487
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,225
- Aren't you drowning?
- No.

488
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:58,826
Are you wearing anything?

489
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,521
Do you wear clothes to bathe'?

490
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:01,593
Huh?

491
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,025
- Are you still looking at me'?
- No.

492
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,300
Sorry...

493
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:09,863
No, it's cool...

494
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,165
May I sit here'?

495
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:13,205
Yeah... sure...

496
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:14,240
Thanks.

497
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:17,339
Come on, who swims
in the middle of the night?

498
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,273
I do.

499
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:24,779
The water is very wet, no'?

500
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,654
A cup of tea would make this perfect.

501
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:35,893
Just a minute. Here you go.

502
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,129
Here are two cups.

503
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:41,934
And now here's the tea.

504
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,395
Sugar?

505
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:44,266
Two spoons.

506
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:45,697
Two spoons?

507
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:46,634
As you wish.

508
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:48,208
These days, I'm cutting back.

509
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:51,512
Tea!

510
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:52,903
Thank you...

511
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:00,019
What was that'?

512
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:01,352
What'?

513
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:02,787
That'?

514
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,158
Oh him.

515
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:05,725
Scaredy cat. It's only a frog!

516
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,762
- Hold on to this.
- Give it here.

517
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:13,394
Who is he'?

518
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:14,598
Meet Ashok.

519
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,130
Why Ashok'? Why not Anarkali'?

520
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,835
He's a male frog.

521
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:26,547
This mark, here'?
It's bigger in male frogs.

522
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,450
- Nice.
- Ashok'?

523
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:30,744
Hi.

524
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:32,348
I'm gonna take you home with me!

525
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:33,351
Alia.

526
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:41,928
This habit of bathing in
waterfalls... how did this start'?

527
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,496
That one.

528
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,864
Actually I'm an insomniac...

529
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,366
ls there a cure'?

530
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,240
Don't you know what insomnia is'?

531
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:58,407
No.

532
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,943
I don't get sleep at night.

533
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,219
What are you saying?

534
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:06,718
I don't sleep. I can't sleep at night.

535
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:07,982
What did you say, that word'?

536
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:09,621
Night'?

537
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,656
Before that. Some big word.

538
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,226
- Insomnia...
- That. I have that too.

539
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:15,029
Shut up.

540
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,494
I swear upon my mother's head.
I can't sleep either.

541
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,029
So what do you do all night?

542
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,261
I try but when I can't sleep.

543
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:27,708
You know when I was a kid,
I'd make kheer.

544
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,567
All nightlong.

545
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,376
Oh, you're a Sikh'?

546
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,483
- How do you know?
- I just saw you. In the flashback.

547
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:40,955
Well-spotted.

548
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,687
All nightlong'?

549
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:46,951
Right up to sunrise.

550
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:48,894
Why'?

551
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:53,828
There was a bulb in the kitchen.
It was kept on.

552
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,502
You afraid of the dark'?

553
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:56,700
Yes...

554
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:57,871
- No.
- Yes.

555
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,598
- Not at all...
- You are afraid of the dark.

556
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:00,469
Not at all.

557
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:01,166
Fraidy cat.

558
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:01,935
Stop it.

559
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:05,103
In the morning, you were
growling at Papa like a tiger.

560
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:06,280
And now you're afraid of the dark.

561
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,383
I'm afraid of the night,
not of monsters.

562
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:09,279
Hey?

563
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:13,484
What scares you about the night?

564
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,380
The night scares me about the night.

565
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,117
The night is the best time of the day.

566
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:21,120
Look, look, what's that'?

567
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:24,599
- Look, Fraidy Cat.
- Not a Fraidy Cat, okay'?

568
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:29,769
It's a horse and I want to go riding.

569
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,996
- You like riding'?
- Have you ridden a horse'?

570
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:34,073
Of course,
I've ridden herds of horses.

571
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:34,967
I'm really good.

572
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,839
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

573
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:42,046
- Since when have you been an insomniac?
- My mum could always put me to sleep.

574
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:43,844
Mama's boy.

575
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,757
"And sunny side upside eggs..."

576
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,894
"And sausages on the side..."

577
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:03,637
"Hash brown <i>&</i> sun dried tomatoes..."

578
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,434
Lovely... bravo...

579
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:14,574
The ladies,
the gentlemen and the Mummyji.

580
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:15,648
Where were you'?

581
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,878
- Today I have an important announcement...
- Your shoes'?

582
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:23,057
- For the merger of Fundwanis and Aroras.
- Meet Ashok. Say hi.

583
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:27,455
This is the first sample
of our Splendiferous perfume.

584
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:28,823
- That's so exciting!

585
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,597
Pass the baatle darling.

586
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,794
Pass the smell, pass the smell.

587
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:36,528
It's nice.

588
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,571
- Cheers to that...
- Cheers, cheers...

589
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,170
Mummyji, cheers...

590
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:40,899
Cheers!

591
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,373
Cheers, Mummyji!

592
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:44,812
Would you pass it, please.

593
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:46,740
Thank you.

594
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,009
Are you very hungry?

595
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,343
No, Why'?

596
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:52,611
- Just like that.
- 10:40...

597
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:58,791
Pass the bacon, darling.

598
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:07,466
If she breaks it, she pays for it.

599
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:09,303
Babla, who are you shooting now?

600
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,370
- Mummyji.
- Why'?

601
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,166
Good morning, everyone.

602
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,276
"What a hottie-hottie."

603
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,340
Good morning, Kamlaji.

604
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:20,907
<i>Ca“ me Karma.</i>

605
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:22,048
Of course.

606
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:27,154
Kamla, for you aloo puri
with a fiery chilli on the side.

607
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:28,752
That's more like it.

608
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,126
And this is the list of the
arrangements for the next few days.

609
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,193
Could you check it, please?

610
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:36,161
Now if you've checked it,
why should I bother'?

611
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,223
Please. Just for me'?

612
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,563
Then of course I will take a look.

613
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:42,862
Thank you.

614
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,431
- Grand picnic.

615
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:48,142
- Black <i>&</i> White Night!

616
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,542
- A night of songs!

617
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,139
- The henna ceremony with Karen...

618
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,576
- Very good.

619
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,112
Everyone will remember this...

620
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,412
business deal!

621
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,680
Won't you have some'?

622
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:01,986
- Nice perfume, isn't it'?

623
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,590
- It's made by exotic flower!

624
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:17,367
- Perfume is okay
but where the sausages?

625
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:23,974
The lovebirds!

626
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:26,337
What's going on'?

627
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,542
Whatever you say, sir.

628
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,950
WHAT IS THIS: News
for the hard of hearing'?

629
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,076
Sorry, you said something?

630
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:34,018
- What's going on here'?
- I wasn't doing anything, sir.

631
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:35,952
What's all this twiddling'?

632
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:40,220
Twiddling'? I was just... asking
Kamlaji if she would like to dance'?

633
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:41,621
Yes, why not'?

634
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:42,830
I too shall dance.

635
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:45,765
You'll... dance'?

636
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:48,396
Of course Jackie
and I are best friends.

637
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:49,861
Jackie?

638
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:50,937
Michael Jackson.

639
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:53,131
Is Jackie a Sindhi too'?

640
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:54,838
Are you the crazy'?

641
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,501
Oh..sorry.. sorry..

642
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:58,870
Of course, he's Sindhi.

643
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,413
Those short pants he wears?
Keeps the cloth bills down.

644
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:02,581
He has diamonds on his gloves.

645
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,914
He dyes his hair black
and makes his face whitemSindhi!

646
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,980
He hasn't called in a while.

647
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:12,250
MJ... isn't he like D-E-D...

648
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:13,751
dead?

649
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:15,624
RIP, man!

650
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:17,892
- Waltz..

651
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,930
The waltz is my favourite dance.

652
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:24,399
Hey you, what's your name... JJ.

653
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,330
- Come here.
- Jagjinder Joginder..haha.

654
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,201
Take that.

655
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:31,477
Thanks, bro!

656
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:33,873
Jagjinder Joginder.

657
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,282
Yeah dude...

658
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:38,348
What's the dope on the bachelor party'?

659
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,017
It's not on my list.

660
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,188
Hmmm... list...

661
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:42,448
The thing is Kamlaji said...

662
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:45,389
Kamlaji is from the girl's side.

663
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:46,953
We're the boy's side.

664
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:48,854
And what we say has to happen,
has to happen.

665
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,530
Bachelor party has to happen.

666
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:52,529
- Has to happen!
- Has to happen!

667
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,228
I'm off to marry a buffalo.

668
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:56,999
Let me have some fun first.

669
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:58,735
Eesha is very sweet.

670
00:44:58,962 --> 00:44:59,599
Exactly.

671
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,001
She's so sweet,

672
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,137
she's a whole flaking patisserie.

673
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:06,779
- Laddoo!
- Laddool!

674
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,596
Ta-da!

675
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:33,965
Sis'? What happened'?

676
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:36,735
Alia, I'm fat. I'm obese.

677
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:39,840
- Nonsense.
- I'm a balloon.

678
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:42,880
No.

679
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:47,052
You're so pretty. You're beautiful.

680
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:51,719
No. Why would a boy like
Robin marry a girl like me'?

681
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,326
Because he got lucky?

682
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,089
Their business is doing well...

683
00:45:57,121 --> 00:46:01,092
and I'm just a clause in
a business deal. A big fat clause.

684
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,107
Did Robin say something, Sis'?

685
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:09,873
Then don't marry him.

686
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,679
Just don't.

687
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,881
Up to now, no one's
rebelled against Mummyji.

688
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:17,451
Not Papa. Not Uncle Vipul.
Not Uncle Vinay. No one.

689
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:19,018
How am I going to do it'?

690
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,615
No. Let the show go on.

691
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:28,288
I'm lucky I got a boy like Robin.

692
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:36,437
Sis, don't.

693
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:47,345
- Sis, stop crying-

694
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:48,983
- Go to sleep, now.

695
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,582
- Come on.
- I'm trying.

696
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:17,337
- All alert, all alert, all alert.

697
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:20,208
- All ready for Eeshafs Bachelor's Party'?

698
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:22,875
- We've kidnapped Eesha.

699
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:25,246
- Eesha on the way.
- Everyone's moustaches in place?

700
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:26,486
Eesha's here.

701
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:29,947
Guys be ready.

702
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,018
Three...

703
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:31,817
Two...

704
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:32,751
one!

705
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:33,517
GO!

706
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,525
That made her happy.

707
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:00,527
Thank you.

708
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:03,624
You're welcome,

709
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:07,023
Mr. Alia.

710
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,664
I must say you're
looking rather handsome.

711
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:15,808
Beeps thinks so too.

712
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:17,144
Who?

713
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:18,704
That villain'?

714
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:20,078
Hey!

715
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:24,550
- He's very special.
- Specially villainous.

716
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,584
He was the one who took me in.

717
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,086
I was adopted.

718
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:36,663
So he chose me.

719
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:39,689
Other kids'? They just come along.

720
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,160
I'm very special, Mr. JJ!

721
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:48,641
JJ. Sorry but this name of yours.

722
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,209
Jagjinder Joginder.

723
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:54,140
Jagjinder Joginder.

724
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:56,243
What kind of name is that'?

725
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:03,149
There's a long story
behind my name.

726
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:06,623
Would you like to hear it, Mr. Alia'?

727
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,232
There you were saying you can't sleep.

728
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:20,438
What did you say you were'?
An lnsomaliac'?

729
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:27,771
So my dad's name was...

730
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:31,150
Joginder Singh...

731
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:36,318
and my mother's
name was Jagjinder Kaur.

732
00:53:58,001 --> 00:53:59,071
Good morning.

733
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:01,741
Good morning.

734
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,176
Where's Alia'?

735
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,712
Alia'?

736
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:10,652
Oh she and l... Last night...
That is... JJ and I...

737
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:16,389
Alia'? You know she
can't sleep at night.

738
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:18,290
She must be here somewhere.

739
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:52,992
Jagjinder Joginder...

740
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:56,036
Jagjinder Joginder...

741
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:19,954
"What a hottie-hottie."

742
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:40,838
Hello?

743
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:43,176
- Alia. Where are you'?

744
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:46,952
I fell asleep?!

745
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:48,616
What'?

746
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:53,794
I fell asleep.

747
00:55:57,954 --> 00:55:58,625
Wow.

748
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,600
<i>How....?</i>

749
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,226
- Okay, but now get up.

750
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:04,736
Get up and run.
Papa's hunting for you.

751
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:06,206
Oh shit.. okay.

752
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:21,818
This...'?

753
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:25,424
Where were you'?

754
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,958
I was sleep... Uh sorry...
I went for a walk, Beeps.

755
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:30,490
Like this?

756
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:31,393
Like this.

757
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:32,592
Where?

758
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:33,923
Here and there.

759
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:35,459
Here or...'?

760
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:55,678
I will shoot everyone.

761
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:56,254
Sir...

762
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:57,380
What happened, Mr. Fundwani'?

763
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:58,890
They've thrown my bro into jail.

764
00:56:59,048 --> 00:56:59,992
- What?
- Good.

765
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:00,890
What'?

766
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:03,192
God. Robin.

767
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,394
Come to jail, Sir.

768
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:05,090
What'?

769
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:06,231
Police station, Sir.

770
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:07,697
- Come let's go.
- Come please.

771
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:08,834
Let's go, let's go.

772
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:11,199
- He took his clothes off in a public place.
- Calm down, please.

773
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:12,702
No, no, he couldn't have done that.

774
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:14,500
Somebody else must have done it.

775
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,937
Look at his face.
Idiot... l mean... innocent.

776
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:19,137
- Bipin, bribe him!
- I'm sorry he broke the law..

777
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,146
Please, if we could quicken
up this whole thing...

778
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:23,647
and you can release this
boy and we can leave from here.

779
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,480
Because the entire
family is over here.

780
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:28,489
Daddy-o, you're getting nowhere.
Let me handle this.

781
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:30,622
Let me talk to them.

782
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,153
Everybody relax. Don't worry.

783
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:37,191
It's gonna be all right. We'll
handle it. Come here. Give me a hug.

784
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:39,630
Irritated?

785
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,466
Keep the old man outside.

786
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:52,045
What happened, Baby'?

787
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,345
They told me to go out.

788
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,418
He's gone in.

789
00:57:58,675 --> 00:57:59,676
JJ my man...

790
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:01,147
JJ my man...

791
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:02,822
Jagjinder Joginder...

792
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,516
Jagjinder Joginder bro...

793
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:07,358
I swear on God, I didn't do anything,
bro. I didn't do anything.

794
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,555
I've been telling them all night,
I did nothing.

795
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:13,166
I didn't touch any of those chicks.

796
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,630
Hold on!

797
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,403
What did you do'?

798
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:19,572
What did you do'?

799
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:39,587
I swear I didn't do anything.

800
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:41,955
I swear on Eesha's head,
I did nothing.

801
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:44,731
All night long,
I've gone bananas telling them...

802
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:46,765
I did nothing.
I didn't even touch those girls.

803
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:47,993
- Did I touch those girls?
- No.

804
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:48,931
Didn't touch those girls.

805
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,231
You shook your booty in golden
chuddies and you say you did nothing.

806
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:53,396
I was just moving them aside.

807
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:56,669
- I swear on Eesha. I swear on Eesha.
- Let me talk to them.

808
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,585
I can't tell you how
much I appreciate it..

809
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:09,647
JJ I must tell you...
the glass is soundproof..

810
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,358
Oh right. Of course..

811
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,284
How much longer can
you keep him there'?

812
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:14,894
We have to let him go JJ..

813
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,497
No James no. You have to
keep him for a bit longer.

814
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:19,224
You have to make him suffer.

815
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:21,527
You have to..
You have to make him cry..

816
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,498
Can you do that thing in Rambo?

817
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:27,938
You know where they take
that water hose and then they just...

818
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:29,534
do stuff like that to him.

819
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:30,734
May be we could open...

820
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,243
Things that will cause him pain!

821
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:34,004
What happened'?

822
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:43,519
It's 12:35.

823
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:47,256
Ok...

824
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:50,596
Yeah I think we should
keep him in for longer.

825
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:52,055
He should suffer.

826
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:53,598
Suffer some more because he's a creep.

827
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:59,564
Could you like give
him like life imprisonment?

828
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:01,199
Alia, are you mad'?

829
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:02,775
Life imprisonment. . Seriously'?

830
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:03,910
Why not'?

831
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:06,871
For strutting his stuff in a bar'?

832
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:08,514
Why not'?

833
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:10,378
I only got a one-day deal, kiddo.

834
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,852
Calm down Alia... calm down.

835
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:14,979
We have to let him go now..

836
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:17,654
Jagjinder Joginder,
my bro, my homie...

837
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:20,150
I have spoken to the officer.

838
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:20,987
Yes, yes'?

839
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:24,063
He'll let you go on one condition.

840
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,564
<i>I'll</i> do anything, anything.

841
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,634
He says you're not to so
much <i>as</i> look at another woman.

842
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,703
- You won't feel them up.
- You won't touch them.

843
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:34,234
You won't even look
at them on Youtube.

844
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:35,206
Or on Twitter.

845
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:36,502
Or Whatsapp...

846
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:38,238
What'?

847
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:39,980
I promise I won't.

848
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:41,212
I won't.

849
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:44,542
You will never again take
your clothes off in a club.

850
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,616
You will never work out again.

851
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:48,481
You will abstain from protein shakes.

852
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:49,917
And eggs.

853
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:51,883
You just won't eat any food.

854
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:53,082
And never take off that shirt.

855
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:54,521
Or your trousers.

856
01:00:55,251 --> 01:01:00,963
I agree. Whatever he wants.
No eggs. The devil take all eggs.

857
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:03,334
Officer, he's agreed
to your conditions.

858
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:05,232
You will never wear gold again.

859
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:15,580
Bro?

860
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,479
Cool down, Bro.

861
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:25,125
They're not Sindhis, Bro.

862
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:27,421
Forgive them.

863
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:32,358
- And you know what'?
- I even had a dream.

864
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:37,203
You know snails can
sleep for three years.

865
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,632
Three years'? Okay.

866
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,432
I think I'm now a snail.

867
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:43,740
Why'?

868
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,273
I can sleep now, Sis.

869
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:50,043
Last night?
I was out like alight. Right out.

870
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:52,479
- Out!
- Like real sleep, sleep-sleep'?

871
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:54,348
With bells and bobtails on.

872
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:56,151
Wow.

873
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:03,526
And you know,
he acts all big and macho...

874
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,463
but he's afraid of the darkness.

875
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:08,868
- Really?
- Really.

876
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,129
- Afraid of the night?
- Afraid.

877
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:57,513
Go away, choo, choo!

878
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:05,555
- Yesss...

879
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:19,798
Want some'?

880
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:43,325
Oh no!

881
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,229
OMG!

882
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:52,801
OMG to you too!

883
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:54,338
Want some'?

884
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:55,540
Yeah!

885
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,705
Let's go skydiving'?

886
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,811
You know, you may never
get another chance at life.

887
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:06,918
Why not'?

888
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:09,216
But you know, if we go together...

889
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:12,022
I'm sure we won't ever
get another chance at life.

890
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:14,994
Just kidding babe.

891
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:16,823
- Flight, listen up, everyone.

892
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:19,231
- Are we ready'?

893
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:20,799
- All set, everyone ready?

894
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:22,035
Let's go!

895
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:25,798
- John'?
- Yes, sir'?

896
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:27,372
- Get the parachute ready.
- Ready, sir!

897
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,838
Let's jump.

898
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:32,379
I'm dying to jump.
Haven't done it for years.

899
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:43,613
Shall we, Daddy-0'?

900
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:44,291
You?

901
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:44,891
Ye-e-e-s!

902
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:46,584
I haven't got my parachooooot!

903
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:56,097
- What are you doing here'?
- Hanging. Checking tickets!

904
01:04:56,759 --> 01:05:01,105
- What'll you do if I don't have one'?
- What'll I do'? <i>I'll</i> let you go...

905
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:11,484
Let's party in mid-air!

906
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:13,883
Entry is free for you, Daddy-o.

907
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,613
- Fancy something special?
- I don't want your stupid free entry!

908
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:18,223
- You are a fallen angel!

909
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:20,685
You're the one who's falling, Daddy-o!

910
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:25,123
I don't have a parachoooooot!

911
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:29,267
How are you liking it, daddy-0'?

912
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:31,895
I was loving it!

913
01:05:32,628 --> 01:05:34,733
Don't take me on, Daddy-o!

914
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,308
I will. What'll you do about it'?

915
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:39,673
Really? Deal done'? Then
congratulations on the match, Daddy-o.

916
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:40,710
- What match'?

917
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,508
Gosh, he's piggy-backing on me now!

918
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:47,113
Now up we go, don't lose it, Daddy-o.

919
01:05:47,543 --> 01:05:48,613
Idiot!

920
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:51,981
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

921
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:54,259
Oh my boy, cheers!

922
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:56,125
- I'm starving.

923
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:03,894
This is all non-vegetarian.

924
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,937
- So what's wrong, sister?
- On Tuesdays I'm vegetarian.

925
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:09,603
Me too.

926
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:12,379
Me too.

927
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:14,740
This is so badly organised!

928
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:16,406
Non-veg on Tuesday?

929
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:17,811
Boy! Cheers.

930
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,147
It's Tuesday and there's non-veg only.

931
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,555
This is the crazy.
It's my Tuesday also.

932
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:26,020
Guys, vegetarian food!

933
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:30,092
Mushrooms <i>&</i> brownies.
Like totally veg...

934
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:33,832
- Like organic.
- Like totally...

935
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:35,363
Like... where did you get them'?

936
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:40,268
Such sweet chaps.
They gave them to us totally free.

937
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:48,480
Hello everybody.

938
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:51,076
Hello... hello, hello...

939
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:53,253
Really very sorry for the delay.

940
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:55,417
Delay? Delay? Delay?

941
01:06:58,781 --> 01:06:59,782
What's going on'?

942
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:08,030
It's our veggie Tuesday.
And all this is non-veg.

943
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:10,702
No, no, today is Monday.
It's Monday today.

944
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:17,342
In India, it's Tuesday. And we
choose not to eat non-veg on Tuesday.

945
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:22,742
All meat, no eat.
All meat, no eat.

946
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:31,022
What are you eating?

947
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:31,949
Mushroom.

948
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:33,022
Show me that.

949
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:36,855
Your attention, please.

950
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:38,594
These narcotropic substances...

951
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:43,032
can have an unexpected
and euphoric effect upon your body.

952
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:45,100
Do not think of them
as innocent things.

953
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:50,606
When they get in you, they reform
your mind and transform your system.

954
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:01,088
This cocktail will
set your blood a-leaping.

955
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:02,649
Yes, you heard that right.

956
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:05,018
Your innards will be blown.

957
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,483
Each bit of your body
will become a celebration.

958
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:09,420
Here. Flock and roll will play!

959
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:10,926
And there the bhangda breaks out!

960
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:13,060
The clouds from the
skies begin to speak.

961
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:15,098
Your fine-tuned mind
turns into a minefield.

962
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:17,066
Your moods turn into floods.

963
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:21,639
Inside, it's technicolour stereophonic.
Outside, it's a family picnic.

964
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:26,713
For the next few hours, you will
enter a new zone of experience.

965
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,210
Please enjoy the ride.

966
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:30,148
This is not for the weak of heart.

967
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:33,012
Meat no eat.
Meat no eat.

968
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,184
This is the crazy.
This is so not...

969
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:40,584
So badly organized.

970
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:44,090
On Monday, it's Tuesday.
And the food's on the wrong day.

971
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:47,624
If it is Tuesday,
it must be vegetarian...

972
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:50,268
So badly organized.

973
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:55,871
On Monday, it's Tuesday.
And the food's on the wrong day.

974
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:03,644
- So badly organized.

975
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:09,016
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.
- And the food's on the wrong day.

976
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:12,049
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.

977
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:18,796
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.

978
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:22,268
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.

979
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:26,133
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.

980
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:28,836
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.

981
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:30,635
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.

982
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:32,537
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.

983
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:34,407
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.

984
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:36,343
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.

985
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:37,982
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.

986
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:42,412
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.

987
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:46,320
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.

988
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:09,582
Have you seen my legs'?

989
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:20,154
I've lost my legs.

990
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:22,922
Find my legs.

991
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:38,210
Let's go look there.

992
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:39,742
Everybody follow me.

993
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:41,074
Hello?

994
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:43,215
I can't get a signal here.

995
01:10:43,706 --> 01:10:44,241
Hello...

996
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:48,616
- Straighten those paws.

997
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:55,926
Hello!

998
01:10:57,219 --> 01:10:59,256
Hello? Hello! Hello?

999
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:00,089
Hello.

1000
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:45,909
Is this a celebration?

1001
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:47,077
<i>Yes, Mummy.</i>

1002
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,111
Shut your gob.

1003
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:50,639
This is no celebration.
It's a business deal.

1004
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:57,150
Go find out if we have
the new logo for Splendiferous.

1005
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:58,456
<i>Yes, Mummy.</i>

1006
01:12:01,016 --> 01:12:03,929
Hey, she's got even fatter.

1007
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:06,325
And this we're going
to have to weigh in gold'?

1008
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:10,467
- Mr. God'? Take this monster to
your breast or I might do your job.

1009
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:11,670
- Yes, Mr. Bhatia'?

1010
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,166
Bipin Arora here.

1011
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:17,303
One second, one second please.

1012
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:22,647
Okay, that logo. Is it ready'?

1013
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:25,143
So please send it to me.

1014
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:26,251
Thank you.

1015
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:27,113
Hello?

1016
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:28,218
Prabha'?

1017
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:32,558
Hello!

1018
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:37,155
Prabha, my love.

1019
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:41,494
Hey, our daughter is
twenty-five years old now.

1020
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:43,125
Alia.

1021
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:46,699
I gave her the name you chose for her.

1022
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:51,174
Her nose is just like yours.

1023
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:56,443
And as she gets older, she shows
the same streaks of craziness as you.

1024
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,644
But she's also weirdly wise.

1025
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:04,956
When I'm with her,
I feel you around me.

1026
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:08,484
She's a happy thing.

1027
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:13,393
But ever since you went away...
the moon doesn't look the same.

1028
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:19,462
I never told her about you, but I made sure
she never missed out on a mother's love.

1029
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:23,272
Sorry...

1030
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:21,467
We met in flying school.

1031
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:32,913
Looking at the deal
between Bipin and Geetu...

1032
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:37,508
it didn't seem like there
was a romantic bone in his body.

1033
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:42,380
He was capable of love
but only for his daughters.

1034
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:47,050
No one could ever dream...

1035
01:14:47,382 --> 01:14:49,794
that Bipin was once a lover-boy.

1036
01:14:50,285 --> 01:14:52,731
That he once had dreamed
of becoming Tom Cruise.

1037
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:02,894
- Then Papa died and I had
to take over the family business.

1038
01:17:03,852 --> 01:17:06,799
- I couldn't bring Prabha home to
Mummyji, she had a 'deal' for me.

1039
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:10,927
- I had to marry Geetu
for the business.

1040
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,367
By then I was not aware that
Prabha is Pregnant.

1041
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:22,839
This is so cool.

1042
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:26,682
I'm illegitimate.

1043
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:27,780
Alia'?

1044
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:29,749
This is so cool, Beeps.

1045
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:30,686
I'm illegitimate!

1046
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:32,792
This is so much better
than being adopted.

1047
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:33,821
Alia'?

1048
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:37,123
I'm illegitimate.

1049
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:39,662
This is so cool...

1050
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:42,166
Oh, nowl get it.

1051
01:17:42,524 --> 01:17:46,233
I always had real-dad
type feelings for you...

1052
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:50,843
but no real-Mum type
feelings for your wife. Right?

1053
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:55,308
Real Papa.

1054
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:01,786
I look like my Mum'?

1055
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:04,847
Your eyes are the same.

1056
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:06,248
Yeah'?

1057
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,418
Your hands.

1058
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:12,260
Really, hands?

1059
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:13,622
Yes, hands.

1060
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:14,892
Hmm, hands.

1061
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:17,535
I think... nose too'?

1062
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:18,933
No, nose looks like your mums.

1063
01:18:19,094 --> 01:18:20,072
Nose looks like my mum.

1064
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:21,365
- Ears.
- Ears.

1065
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:28,006
So cool.

1066
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:35,216
Tomorrow, a real father-daughter
team is going to party.

1067
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:47,164
What happened'?

1068
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:49,825
One thing I don't get.

1069
01:18:52,527 --> 01:18:58,341
Why did Tenthouse keep
this bit of the video a secret'?

1070
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:01,944
If he wanted, he could
have exposed this to everyone.

1071
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:03,973
He didn't. Why didn't he'?

1072
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,949
He must have had his own agenda.

1073
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:12,450
What reason could he have'?

1074
01:19:13,348 --> 01:19:16,158
No, no...

1075
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:18,461
He was protecting you.

1076
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:22,929
Because he was protecting me.

1077
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:27,773
That's it.

1078
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:31,840
He was protecting you
because he was protecting me.

1079
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,274
Because he loves me.

1080
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:34,243
What'?

1081
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:37,613
You cracked it Beeps.
You really cracked it there.

1082
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:39,080
I said nothing of the kind.

1083
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:40,652
No you just said it. You cracked it.

1084
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:44,552
Nothing. I said nothing of the kind.
What did I say'? I said nothing.

1085
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:45,622
You said he loves me.

1086
01:19:45,747 --> 01:19:46,418
No.

1087
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:47,719
- You said that.
- No.

1088
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:49,461
He loves me.

1089
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:51,965
- Alia, Alia.
- You're so smart.

1090
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:53,288
Kiddo, I said nothing of the kind.

1091
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:54,832
Alia, Alia.

1092
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:55,934
Alia!

1093
01:19:56,758 --> 01:19:58,135
Kiddo, he's a hornswoggler.

1094
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,146
Soniaaa!

1095
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:38,343
Ketchup!

1096
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:44,313
Papaji!

1097
01:20:47,742 --> 01:20:48,482
Alia'?

1098
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:49,448
Yes?

1099
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:54,291
You wanted to go riding, no'?

1100
01:20:56,318 --> 01:20:57,126
Yes.

1101
01:20:58,620 --> 01:20:59,360
Tomorrow.

1102
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:03,094
Morning. Six am.

1103
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:04,969
You, me and a horse.

1104
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:09,171
Okay.

1105
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:10,771
- Great.
- It's not necessary.

1106
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:13,708
You don't only do what is necessary.

1107
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:16,509
You also do some things
because they make you happy.

1108
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:20,512
- Like deep.
- Like totally.

1109
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:28,090
Okay?

1110
01:21:30,986 --> 01:21:32,988
What's with this 36'?

1111
01:21:36,124 --> 01:21:37,068
What is it'?

1112
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:39,970
Think about it.

1113
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:43,405
Okay.

1114
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:47,441
- Good night.
- Good night.

1115
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:49,076
It's different.

1116
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:52,013
It's different?

1117
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:54,209
Hey, Tenthouse!

1118
01:21:57,345 --> 01:21:58,881
You think you're going
to take her horse riding'?

1119
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:02,022
I am. What will you do about it'?

1120
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:03,861
I am going to take her horse riding.

1121
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:05,697
Sure. Do that.

1122
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:06,888
You watch your step.

1123
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,736
Daddy-o, this is only a rehearsal.

1124
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:17,767
One day, I'm going to get me
on a white horse and whisk her off...

1125
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:19,211
and whafre you going to do then'?

1126
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:21,505
You come with your white horse
and <i>I'll</i> show you what <i>I'll</i> do.

1127
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:22,273
Okay!

1128
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:23,605
" Okay!
" Okay!

1129
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:24,443
<i>- Oye.
- Oye.</i>

1130
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:25,549
<i>- Oye.
- Oye.</i>

1131
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:26,976
Good night then.

1132
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:28,450
- Sleep well.
- Okay.

1133
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:29,620
Hold on, excuse me, one moment.

1134
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:30,618
Yes?

1135
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:35,025
What's that about 36'?

1136
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:42,935
Think about it.

1137
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:48,532
Thirty-six.

1138
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:49,941
Think.

1139
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:51,342
Good night.

1140
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:58,814
- He's not going to
get anywhere near Alia.

1141
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:04,783
Oh God!

1142
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:07,353
Looks like <i>I'll</i> have
to go riding with Beeps.

1143
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:08,525
It's cute.

1144
01:24:41,776 --> 01:24:43,449
<i>Array Tenthouse'.!</i>

1145
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:47,390
Oh no!

1146
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:48,286
<i>Yikes...</i>

1147
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:55,430
Tenthouse!

1148
01:25:21,082 --> 01:25:22,652
Nothing like that is going to happen.

1149
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:24,593
No?

1150
01:25:27,922 --> 01:25:28,832
Hmmm...

1151
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:31,226
Okay, let's go.

1152
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:32,935
Let's indeed.

1153
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:34,298
So get on with it.

1154
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:36,601
Come let's go.
Yes. Come on then.

1155
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:39,244
And we ride. I mean, we gallop.

1156
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:39,970
Clippety-CWP-

1157
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:40,977
Indeed.

1158
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:42,610
Right.

1159
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:44,606
- Come on.
- Let's go.

1160
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:48,981
- Come on.
- Let's go.

1161
01:25:50,111 --> 01:25:50,782
Come on.

1162
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:53,354
What's up'?

1163
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:55,289
You don't know how to ride, do you'?

1164
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:57,755
No.

1165
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:02,564
- Sweet.
- No.

1166
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:04,632
Let's go.

1167
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:10,674
Tenthouse, hold your horses!

1168
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:16,242
You know,
Beeps was going to come riding.

1169
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:19,041
He only told me to take you riding.

1170
01:26:20,742 --> 01:26:22,949
We're being kidnapped.
We're being kidnapped.

1171
01:26:23,811 --> 01:26:26,621
Jagjinder, Jagjinder...

1172
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:28,188
Alia!

1173
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:40,531
- My friend!
- Namaste!

1174
01:26:40,795 --> 01:26:42,035
Namaste, India!

1175
01:26:44,999 --> 01:26:45,704
Friends!

1176
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:46,876
Are we'?

1177
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:48,241
We both Sindhi.

1178
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:49,444
Sindhi-Sindhi!

1179
01:26:49,637 --> 01:26:50,615
Nobody's perfect.

1180
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:53,946
- Shall we'?
- Please, please, please.

1181
01:26:54,108 --> 01:26:56,054
Yes please, come.

1182
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:58,118
He's so fake!

1183
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:00,618
Cut it. I want my face to look thin.

1184
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:05,223
All good, Sir'?

1185
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:07,195
- Is the cheque where I want it'?
- Of course.

1186
01:27:08,089 --> 01:27:09,033
<i>And You'?</i>

1187
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:11,292
Kidding.

1188
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:12,833
Right then.

1189
01:27:12,994 --> 01:27:14,803
Right then, let's begin.
Mehendi with Karan!

1190
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:18,172
All right, then.

1191
01:27:18,499 --> 01:27:20,501
You look beautiful and you look cold.

1192
01:27:22,637 --> 01:27:25,208
Are you okay'? All right.
Shall we begin?

1193
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:26,476
- Yes.
- Are you set'?

1194
01:27:26,641 --> 01:27:27,847
Are you ready, both of you'?

1195
01:27:28,843 --> 01:27:30,345
Where did you first meet'?

1196
01:27:30,578 --> 01:27:34,617
We met on Jan 22,
after a party at Malhotras.

1197
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:35,951
Sweet.

1198
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:38,723
No.

1199
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:39,728
All right.

1200
01:27:39,854 --> 01:27:41,162
And when did you get engaged?

1201
01:27:41,322 --> 01:27:42,699
Ummm December...

1202
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:45,638
No, no, no... January.

1203
01:27:46,227 --> 01:27:47,137
December or January'?

1204
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:48,871
December December, yeah yeah.

1205
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:50,599
Oh Mr. Muscles doesn't remember.

1206
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:54,077
3. December 3.

1207
01:27:54,369 --> 01:27:55,245
December 3.

1208
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:56,141
Correct.

1209
01:27:56,404 --> 01:27:58,179
What was written
on the engagement cake'?

1210
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,351
Happy engagement, what else'?

1211
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:02,277
No.

1212
01:28:02,510 --> 01:28:04,615
No, actually it was,
'Together for each other'.

1213
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:07,357
'Together for each other"?
With him'?

1214
01:28:08,349 --> 01:28:10,124
Anyway, these are the minor details.

1215
01:28:10,351 --> 01:28:12,661
Shall we start the
exciting buzzer round'?

1216
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:16,526
Come on... go for it... yay...

1217
01:28:17,525 --> 01:28:19,368
One second, one second, how will you
use the buzzer? Your henna is wet.

1218
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:20,299
Alia.

1219
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:22,232
Alia come and help.

1220
01:28:22,497 --> 01:28:24,704
- Alia'?
- My little sister.

1221
01:28:24,932 --> 01:28:26,036
She'll press the buzzer for me.

1222
01:28:26,567 --> 01:28:28,638
- Okay, all right, okay.
- Thank you.

1223
01:28:28,936 --> 01:28:29,505
Let's begin.

1224
01:28:29,737 --> 01:28:32,149
Each other's favourite colour?

1225
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:35,518
Brown. Yellow.

1226
01:28:35,943 --> 01:28:36,512
No.

1227
01:28:36,944 --> 01:28:39,185
- Gold.
- His favourite colour is gold.

1228
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:40,120
Yes.

1229
01:28:40,281 --> 01:28:42,386
- Yeah.
- Okay, right then.

1230
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:43,391
Favourite place?

01:28:44,018 --> 01:28:44,758

1232
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:46,521
Kitchen!

1233
01:28:46,788 --> 01:28:48,324
His is... uh... Hong Kong.

1234
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:50,496
- You like Hong Kong'?
- Yeah.

1235
01:28:50,792 --> 01:28:51,532
Looks right.

1236
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,662
- Favourite movie'?
- Rambo

1237
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:56,170
Rambo.

1238
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:57,401
Brainless Rambo.

1239
01:28:57,665 --> 01:28:58,666
Favourite food'?

1240
01:28:59,534 --> 01:29:00,274
Anything-

1241
01:29:00,768 --> 01:29:01,371
Anything?

1242
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:03,943
He likes egg whites and he's right.

1243
01:29:04,272 --> 01:29:06,809
I like anything as long as it's tasty.

1244
01:29:06,974 --> 01:29:08,783
Me too. Just like me.

1245
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:10,645
All right.

1246
01:29:10,778 --> 01:29:11,449
Hobby'?

1247
01:29:17,151 --> 01:29:18,152
Sketching.

1248
01:29:18,453 --> 01:29:19,329
Sketching.

1249
01:29:19,954 --> 01:29:22,161
I think gymming maybe.

1250
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:23,762
Gymming, don't be silly no.

1251
01:29:25,593 --> 01:29:29,803
And I'm sure you
know the answer to this.

1252
01:29:30,298 --> 01:29:31,208
I hope you do.

1253
01:29:31,632 --> 01:29:33,373
Your favourite moment together?

1254
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:37,607
When I got my eight packs
and half is on its way.

1255
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:39,176
Half what is on the way'?

1256
01:29:39,474 --> 01:29:40,953
Half pack'?
Eight-and-a-half'?

1257
01:29:41,075 --> 01:29:42,383
This is your favourite
moment together?

1258
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:44,080
When you got eight-and-a-half packs.

1259
01:29:44,312 --> 01:29:45,791
- Yeah'?
- No, Robin.

1260
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:47,186
When I met Robin.

1261
01:29:47,415 --> 01:29:48,689
- How sweet.
- Who is Robin'?

1262
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:49,928
This is Robin.

1263
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:51,360
This is Robin'?

1264
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:57,665
On which note, I have to
SAY: The bride gets the hamper.

1265
01:29:59,794 --> 01:30:00,465
Thank you.

1266
01:30:00,795 --> 01:30:01,773
Now who's next'?

1267
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:03,101
Alia.

1268
01:30:03,431 --> 01:30:03,966
Alia.

1269
01:30:04,198 --> 01:30:07,475
Come on then, Gorgeous.
Let's have you on the couch.

1270
01:30:08,302 --> 01:30:08,973
Yeah.

1271
01:30:09,804 --> 01:30:10,475
All the best.

1272
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:11,342
- Thank you.
- Bye darling.

1273
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:11,950
Bye.

1274
01:30:12,206 --> 01:30:13,446
Take this man away.

1275
01:30:14,976 --> 01:30:16,182
All set, Alia'?

1276
01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:18,283
Who would you like to call'?

1277
01:30:19,714 --> 01:30:21,091
Jagjinder Joginder.

1278
01:30:22,817 --> 01:30:24,592
- Okay...
- And Beeps.

1279
01:30:24,886 --> 01:30:25,762
Go brother.

1280
01:30:25,887 --> 01:30:26,490
Beeps?

1281
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:27,825
My Dad.

1282
01:30:28,055 --> 01:30:28,863
Oh!

1283
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:32,928
Papa and boyfriend.
Scandal. I like it.

1284
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:36,674
Why did you have to call him'?

1285
01:30:37,498 --> 01:30:37,976
Ready'?

1286
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:38,768
Shall we'?

1287
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:39,708
It's a buzzer round'?

1288
01:30:39,834 --> 01:30:40,471
Get set'?

1289
01:30:40,902 --> 01:30:41,642
Go.

1290
01:30:42,236 --> 01:30:43,647
Alia's favourite colour?

1291
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:46,214
- Blue.
- Ooh in tandem.

1292
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:48,382
Alia's favourite snack?

1293
01:30:48,543 --> 01:30:49,317
- Bananas.
- Bananas.

1294
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:50,482
Correct.

1295
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:52,482
What kind of boy would Alia like'?

1296
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:54,685
The kind with whom she
could fall asleep with and dream.

1297
01:30:55,016 --> 01:30:56,222
Interesting, I like that.

1298
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:58,523
The kind with whom
she could sleep with and dream!

1299
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:00,025
Correct.

1300
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:03,567
On that note again,
what is Alia's favourite number'?

1301
01:31:03,825 --> 01:31:04,565
Thirty-six.

1302
01:31:04,926 --> 01:31:05,768
Why thirty-six'?

1303
01:31:06,093 --> 01:31:06,867
Think about it.

1304
01:31:07,094 --> 01:31:08,437
What's to think?
You've got to figure it out.

1305
01:31:09,964 --> 01:31:11,705
What is Alia's favourite hobby'?

1306
01:31:12,433 --> 01:31:13,275
Horse riding.

1307
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:17,850
Uncle, you're falling behind.

1308
01:31:18,706 --> 01:31:19,878
Last question.

1309
01:31:21,742 --> 01:31:23,983
Who is Alia's favourite person?

1310
01:31:28,382 --> 01:31:29,759
Let him answer that one too.

1311
01:31:33,888 --> 01:31:34,958
Her Beeps.

1312
01:31:39,694 --> 01:31:40,968
- Correct.
- Idiot.

1313
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:43,300
You're the best.

1314
01:31:45,132 --> 01:31:51,811
So you got a daughter's love but
the hamper goes to Jagjinder Joginder.

1315
01:31:58,379 --> 01:32:01,053
<i>I'll</i> take the girl.
You keep the hamper.

1316
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:04,963
I love that!

1317
01:32:05,419 --> 01:32:06,363
Love that, love that!

1318
01:32:06,487 --> 01:32:10,299
On that note, we'll call it a night,
that was a good fight, keep it tight.

1319
01:32:10,491 --> 01:32:10,935
Thank you.

1320
01:32:11,125 --> 01:32:12,661
It's all about loving your parents!

1321
01:32:14,929 --> 01:32:15,873
Baseborn brat!

1322
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:18,336
<i>One same, one same.</i>

1323
01:32:18,566 --> 01:32:21,877
- All right, ok.
- Come on, all right, pose.

1324
01:32:32,513 --> 01:32:33,355
The Firecracker?

1325
01:32:35,116 --> 01:32:36,254
I love you.

1326
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:38,526
I'm missing you.

1327
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:40,425
Where are you'?

1328
01:32:48,162 --> 01:32:49,266
He's a fool.

1329
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:53,944
Look, how he chases
everything in skirts.

1330
01:32:54,302 --> 01:32:55,280
Womaniser!

1331
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,550
Which girls have you
seen him with, Beeps'?

1332
01:32:57,838 --> 01:32:59,408
Which girls have I seen him with'?

1333
01:32:59,607 --> 01:33:03,111
Look at him, just look at him.
Even Mummyji isn't safe.

1334
01:33:03,344 --> 01:33:04,948
He's even got his eye on her.

1335
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:08,523
If I don't stop him,
he might be my step-father one day.

1336
01:33:08,816 --> 01:33:11,228
Look, look, his next target.

1337
01:33:12,386 --> 01:33:14,093
Look, he's so sweet to Eesha.

1338
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:15,825
So sweet to Eesha, my tush!

1339
01:33:17,858 --> 01:33:18,768
Flirt!

1340
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:20,269
Roadside Romeo!

1341
01:33:20,494 --> 01:33:24,465
Don't believe me, do you'?
<i>I'll</i> show you. I have proof.

1342
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:28,211
Hard evidence.

1343
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:33,741
Hello hello, hello, one two three, one
two three, testing, testing, testing.

1344
01:33:35,643 --> 01:33:36,621
Ladies and gentlemen.

1345
01:33:36,811 --> 01:33:41,658
There's been another romance
brewing in this romantic atmosphere.

1346
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:44,559
A romance that has
been kept hidden from us.

1347
01:33:45,686 --> 01:33:46,926
Just a second, ladies and gentlemen!

1348
01:33:51,058 --> 01:33:52,196
Presenting, his firecracker!

1349
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:53,904
One second.

1350
01:33:56,731 --> 01:33:57,607
Here you are.

1351
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:04,412
OMG... she's like old.

1352
01:34:04,805 --> 01:34:05,875
I am younger than her!

1353
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:08,314
- What's happening, Tenthouse'?
- Love you firecracker.

1354
01:34:08,576 --> 01:34:10,419
- What's happening?
- A marriage is happening.

1355
01:34:11,045 --> 01:34:12,183
Here too.

1356
01:34:14,281 --> 01:34:17,660
Namaste-ji, Sat Sri Akal, CC to all.

1357
01:34:18,252 --> 01:34:21,597
<i>Hey Mr. Nora, remember we met'?</i>

1358
01:34:21,989 --> 01:34:23,900
I' m Khushwant Kaur.

1359
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:26,396
Your daughter's the
one getting married, right'?

1360
01:34:26,594 --> 01:34:28,130
A hundred thousand
blessings on her sweet head.

1361
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:29,273
Thank you.

1362
01:34:29,463 --> 01:34:31,204
Daddy-O, meet my CEO.

1363
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:32,434
I told you.

1364
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:34,404
Everything under control, Gran'?

1365
01:34:34,602 --> 01:34:38,311
Not bad, not bad.
We've got too much chole.

1366
01:34:38,706 --> 01:34:42,745
But no one can make kheer like you.

1367
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:44,482
Tell me what's with you'?

1368
01:34:44,812 --> 01:34:46,621
The balloon boy went missing
so I'm blowing these up myself.

1369
01:34:46,781 --> 01:34:47,919
I've got to go.

1370
01:34:48,049 --> 01:34:55,297
The band is here but the boy's side
want hip hop songs, the silly berks.

1371
01:34:55,656 --> 01:34:57,727
Gran, gran, hold on a moment.

1372
01:34:59,994 --> 01:35:00,836
MY phone'?

1373
01:35:02,096 --> 01:35:03,302
I want to talk to my grandmother.

1374
01:35:15,943 --> 01:35:18,924
Gran, I think I could sleep now.

1375
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:21,724
- What are you saying?

1376
01:35:23,651 --> 01:35:24,891
That frog girl'?

1377
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:34,430
You're a wonder, Gran!

1378
01:35:35,196 --> 01:35:36,470
Bring her to me.

1379
01:35:37,131 --> 01:35:37,905
Of course.

1380
01:36:09,497 --> 01:36:12,478
"As they rise in the morning."

1381
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:16,508
"Through layers of sleep."

1382
01:36:19,073 --> 01:36:21,849
"A story is woven."

1383
01:36:24,011 --> 01:36:25,752
"A story so deep."

1384
01:36:29,049 --> 01:36:31,051
"it's tough as steel"

1385
01:36:33,521 --> 01:36:35,592
"it's gentle as a feather."

1386
01:36:38,826 --> 01:36:44,242
"it's drawn these two hearts together"

1387
01:36:49,203 --> 01:36:51,205
"it's slow, it's subtle."

1388
01:36:51,605 --> 01:36:53,346
"it's soft as a feather"

1389
01:36:53,941 --> 01:36:56,615
"it's not to be felt."

1390
01:36:58,846 --> 01:37:00,587
"It can only be sensed."

1391
01:37:01,115 --> 01:37:02,753
"This feeling of security."

1392
01:37:03,551 --> 01:37:06,327
"This feeling of closeness."

1393
01:37:27,608 --> 01:37:29,110
"These eyes are a river."

1394
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:32,948
"These eyes are a fountainhead."

1395
01:37:36,984 --> 01:37:38,588
"What flows from them?"

1396
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:42,362
"A river of hope."

1397
01:37:45,726 --> 01:37:52,234
"This is what eyes have always done."

1398
01:37:55,269 --> 01:38:01,914
"They say the unsayable,
they tell the truth."

1399
01:38:04,812 --> 01:38:08,282
"Two shadows have begun to play."

1400
01:38:09,483 --> 01:38:11,827
"They merge,
they melt, they fade away."

1401
01:38:14,421 --> 01:38:21,100
"They slip and slide through the air."

1402
01:38:24,431 --> 01:38:29,938
"Now they have wings."

1403
01:38:34,008 --> 01:38:39,754
"These hearts can fly."

1404
01:39:01,468 --> 01:39:02,879
- What is this we are doing, Alia'?

1405
01:39:03,370 --> 01:39:04,974
Wait, it has to dry.

1406
01:39:05,472 --> 01:39:06,644
Then we peel it.

1407
01:39:07,408 --> 01:39:12,323
I can't believe you've never put glue
all over your hands and let it dry.

1408
01:39:13,013 --> 01:39:14,117
- Right.
- And what happens now?

1409
01:39:14,415 --> 01:39:15,291
Wait. Peel and see.

1410
01:39:15,482 --> 01:39:16,654
Oh wow.

1411
01:39:19,253 --> 01:39:21,324
- Do it, do it.
- Oh God, that's disgusting.

1412
01:39:23,757 --> 01:39:26,033
My skin is peeling away, doctor.

1413
01:39:26,393 --> 01:39:28,202
Please help me, doctor.

1414
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:31,902
I know. You want a puff.

1415
01:39:39,239 --> 01:39:40,081
What's this'?

1416
01:39:40,774 --> 01:39:41,809
One minute, <i>I'll</i> show you.

1417
01:39:42,076 --> 01:39:42,713
<i>Useless.</i>

1418
01:39:44,845 --> 01:39:47,348
THUMB'? IT SAYS: Good luck.

1419
01:39:47,815 --> 01:39:48,919
This one points.

1420
01:39:49,416 --> 01:39:50,087
Point.

1421
01:39:53,187 --> 01:39:54,495
Pee-Pee!

1422
01:39:54,688 --> 01:39:55,530
You want to go'?

1423
01:39:56,056 --> 01:39:57,057
Fling finger.

1424
01:39:57,358 --> 01:39:58,359
What's this'?

1425
01:39:58,959 --> 01:39:59,767
<i>Useless.</i>

1426
01:39:59,927 --> 01:40:01,167
This finger has no use.

1427
01:40:01,428 --> 01:40:02,429
- No use at all.
- It's useless.

1428
01:40:02,696 --> 01:40:04,073
No use.
Are you sure'?

1429
01:40:04,264 --> 01:40:04,935
<i>Useless.</i>

1430
01:40:05,165 --> 01:40:05,973
Two-thirty.

1431
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:08,146
No use at all'?

1432
01:40:09,136 --> 01:40:10,080
Nothing?

1433
01:40:10,637 --> 01:40:12,082
So let's break the darned thing.

1434
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:25,762
Mummy and I would dunk
this in warm milk and eat it.

1435
01:40:28,622 --> 01:40:29,600
Where... she'?

1436
01:40:30,157 --> 01:40:30,862
<i>Eh'?</i>

1437
01:40:35,562 --> 01:40:36,336
What'?

1438
01:40:37,498 --> 01:40:38,238
Didn't get that'?

1439
01:40:38,732 --> 01:40:39,437
Where is she'?

1440
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:40,476
Where is she'?

1441
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:41,771
Where is she'?

1442
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:43,748
Mummy'?

1443
01:40:46,106 --> 01:40:48,086
One night,
we were playing hide-and-seek.

1444
01:40:49,009 --> 01:40:50,579
I counted to hundred.

1445
01:40:51,545 --> 01:40:53,081
When I went to look,
they weren't there.

1446
01:40:55,182 --> 01:40:57,594
They were picked up,
made to vanish, in the riots.

1447
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:00,123
I never saw them again.

1448
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:09,374
After that, did you ever play'?

1449
01:41:10,798 --> 01:41:11,606
What'?

1450
01:41:12,466 --> 01:41:13,638
Hide-and-seek'?

1451
01:41:16,303 --> 01:41:17,247
Let's play then'?

1452
01:41:19,873 --> 01:41:20,578
Let's.

1453
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:07,656
Hello, wrong number!

1454
01:42:50,164 --> 01:42:51,165
ATTAC K!

1455
01:43:50,991 --> 01:43:51,799
Mummyji agreed to...

1456
01:43:52,059 --> 01:43:54,130
Do you know?
Alia sleeps with him.

1457
01:43:58,031 --> 01:43:59,669
Mr. Choksi, <i>I'll</i> come to your room.

1458
01:43:59,833 --> 01:44:01,335
Sir, whatever happens here stays here.

1459
01:44:01,501 --> 01:44:02,479
Run along.

1460
01:44:02,736 --> 01:44:03,737
<i>I'll</i> come to your room.

1461
01:44:03,870 --> 01:44:05,110
Okay, sir, as you say.

1462
01:44:09,209 --> 01:44:10,017
What rubbish!

1463
01:44:10,277 --> 01:44:11,255
It's not nonsense, Dad.

1464
01:44:11,378 --> 01:44:14,052
Alia sleeps with Jagjinder Joginder.

1465
01:44:14,815 --> 01:44:16,123
How dare he!

1466
01:44:16,483 --> 01:44:19,327
I'll kill him if he so
much as lays a hand on her.

1467
01:44:19,886 --> 01:44:20,921
Shut up, Papa.

1468
01:44:21,288 --> 01:44:24,132
Alia goes to sleep now.
She can sleep because of Joginder.

1469
01:44:25,225 --> 01:44:27,728
Alia didn't even know
what a dream was up to now.

1470
01:44:28,862 --> 01:44:31,638
Isn't that what you always wanted'?

1471
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:34,469
That she should sleep,
perchance to dream?

1472
01:44:34,835 --> 01:44:36,610
Please don't separate them, Papa.

1473
01:44:36,937 --> 01:44:38,575
But he's not good
enough for her, my girl.

1474
01:44:39,072 --> 01:44:40,380
Maybe not.

1475
01:44:40,907 --> 01:44:42,352
But who will be suitable for Alia'?

1476
01:44:42,542 --> 01:44:44,522
Who will love her more than you'?

1477
01:44:45,345 --> 01:44:50,192
That means whoever comes along
will always be second-best, right'?

1478
01:44:50,684 --> 01:44:53,688
But you won't get a better
second-best than Jaginder Joginder.

1479
01:44:54,121 --> 01:44:55,657
What rot you talk.

1480
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:57,826
There are much better boys.

1481
01:44:59,092 --> 01:45:00,571
Like the one you found for me'?

1482
01:45:02,229 --> 01:45:04,106
Like the one Grandma found for you'?

1483
01:45:04,931 --> 01:45:06,308
Will you let that happen to Alia too'?

1484
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:11,176
If you stop her today, Dad,
Grandma will turn her into a deal too.

1485
01:45:11,772 --> 01:45:14,252
Will you be able to do anything then'?
Or even say anything?

1486
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:18,251
You've never said a thing
but do it now. For Alia.

1487
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:20,883
She's your favourite, isn't she'?

1488
01:45:25,218 --> 01:45:27,425
Okay, Dad, just come with me.

1489
01:45:29,222 --> 01:45:29,927
Come no'?

1490
01:45:30,057 --> 01:45:31,468
- Where?
- Come on.

1491
01:45:31,692 --> 01:45:32,466
Where, kid'?

1492
01:45:32,626 --> 01:45:33,434
Please.

1493
01:45:37,831 --> 01:45:39,333
Just look at them.

1494
01:46:11,498 --> 01:46:13,239
- Look at this empty theatre.

1495
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:14,811
- That's what you call
conspicuous consumption.

1496
01:46:15,135 --> 01:46:17,081
In a hall which can seat
two thousand, twenty people sit.

1497
01:46:17,337 --> 01:46:19,715
Look at that gang of gold-diggers.

1498
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:21,977
- Robin, you're the man!

1499
01:46:26,913 --> 01:46:28,790
"Girls are fundamentally sentimental."

1500
01:46:28,949 --> 01:46:31,555
"That drives them mental."

1501
01:46:31,818 --> 01:46:33,661
"Girls are fundamentally sentimental."

1502
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:36,198
"That drives them mental."

1503
01:46:41,595 --> 01:46:43,472
"One small step from sentimental."

1504
01:46:43,630 --> 01:46:46,076
"To fundamentally mental."

1505
01:46:46,533 --> 01:46:48,342
"One small step from sentimental."

1506
01:46:48,535 --> 01:46:50,708
"To fundamentally mental."

1507
01:46:51,938 --> 01:46:54,111
"If a mosquito bites Ma'am,."

1508
01:46:54,374 --> 01:46:56,877
<i>"She takes a same of it."</i>

1509
01:46:57,444 --> 01:46:59,048
"And then off it goes"

1510
01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:01,623
"to lnstagram".

1511
01:47:02,282 --> 01:47:05,286
"She knows nothing of the world."

1512
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:10,158
"Into herself she stays curled."

1513
01:47:11,658 --> 01:47:13,228
"May the Lord protect us from girls."

1514
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:15,736
"From their curls
and whorls and pearls."

1515
01:47:16,329 --> 01:47:17,467
I'm in love!

1516
01:47:18,331 --> 01:47:19,935
"They're a bundle of fake notes."

1517
01:47:20,133 --> 01:47:22,704
"They're a lot of cancelled votes."

1518
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:25,011
"One small step from sentimental."

1519
01:47:25,205 --> 01:47:27,651
"To fundamentally mental."

1520
01:47:28,141 --> 01:47:29,916
"One small step from sentimental."

1521
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:31,885
"To fundamentally mental."

1522
01:47:35,949 --> 01:47:38,225
"Words of love come
from a man's mouth."

1523
01:47:38,385 --> 01:47:40,922
"But his true feelings
lie somewhat south."

1524
01:47:41,455 --> 01:47:43,093
"it's not his heart that's beating."

1525
01:47:43,323 --> 01:47:45,894
"it's his trousersnake
that's bleating."

1526
01:47:47,928 --> 01:47:50,499
"Words of love come
from a man's mouth."

1527
01:47:50,697 --> 01:47:53,234
"But his true feelings
lie somewhat south."

1528
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:55,407
"it's not his heart that's beating."

1529
01:47:55,569 --> 01:47:58,015
"it's his trousersnake
that's bleating."

1530
01:47:58,605 --> 01:48:01,552
"His biceps may be
big but what of it?"

1531
01:48:03,443 --> 01:48:06,083
"His brain is pea-sized
and totally full of it."

1532
01:48:07,781 --> 01:48:11,695
"Oh Lord, Lord, show them
what they look like."

1533
01:48:14,588 --> 01:48:15,862
"Men are mistakes."

1534
01:48:16,056 --> 01:48:18,627
"That women make."

1535
01:48:19,593 --> 01:48:20,833
"Men are mistakes."

1536
01:48:20,961 --> 01:48:23,669
"That women make."

1537
01:48:24,431 --> 01:48:28,573
"They call us mental
when they're the same."

1538
01:48:29,369 --> 01:48:32,976
"They call us mental
when they're the same."

1539
01:48:43,884 --> 01:48:47,593
"All this make up that
you slap on your face."

1540
01:48:48,488 --> 01:48:52,402
"If a man won't turn round,
it's a disgrace."

1541
01:48:52,659 --> 01:48:54,434
"Just a disgrace."

1542
01:48:54,728 --> 01:48:56,469
"Just a disgrace."

1543
01:48:56,763 --> 01:48:59,369
"Oh right, and as if your big car."

1544
01:48:59,566 --> 01:49:01,546
"Doesn't tell me what a prig you are."

1545
01:49:02,002 --> 01:49:03,675
"it's not just a symbol of your money."

1546
01:49:03,803 --> 01:49:06,283
"It tells me what you
don't got down there, honey."

1547
01:49:08,608 --> 01:49:10,610
"The world's a bus-stop."

1548
01:49:10,877 --> 01:49:12,914
"Girls come and go."

1549
01:49:13,213 --> 01:49:15,159
"If you miss one."

1550
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:17,123
"Another will show."

1551
01:49:17,350 --> 01:49:19,728
"Be careful how many buses you drop."

1552
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:22,059
"You may end up sleeping
at the bus stop."

1553
01:49:22,489 --> 01:49:24,298
"You'd better stop such silly talk."

1554
01:49:24,457 --> 01:49:26,528
"Or you might be forced to walk."

1555
01:49:26,993 --> 01:49:31,100
"Even God was rather
startled with His creation."

1556
01:49:31,565 --> 01:49:35,035
"Women are His miracle,
men are his fraud."

1557
01:49:35,769 --> 01:49:39,911
"A daughter is someone
else's property."

1558
01:49:40,206 --> 01:49:44,450
"Better that than being
black money as a man can be."

1559
01:49:45,078 --> 01:49:47,183
"Better that than being
black money as a man can be."

1560
01:49:47,347 --> 01:49:49,054
"Better that than being
black money as a man can be."

1561
01:49:49,349 --> 01:49:51,488
"Our case is strong,
our point is made."

1562
01:49:51,685 --> 01:49:53,665
"Our case is strong,
our point is made."

1563
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:57,800
"Go wash your face,
your rouge may fade."

1564
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:03,931
"Men are only footwear
for women's use."

1565
01:50:04,531 --> 01:50:08,343
"Men are only footwear
for women's use."

1566
01:50:09,102 --> 01:50:10,581
"They say we're mental."

1567
01:50:10,770 --> 01:50:13,080
"But these aren't gentlemen."

1568
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:17,588
"They're mistakes, these mental men."

1569
01:50:55,982 --> 01:50:59,395
"I may be the sandal but
I have to take your weight."

1570
01:50:59,786 --> 01:51:01,231
"I would try to be your beloved hero."

1571
01:51:01,454 --> 01:51:02,956
"No size zero!"

1572
01:51:03,356 --> 01:51:04,835
"No size zero!"

1573
01:51:05,458 --> 01:51:06,960
"Look at the match made for me."

1574
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:08,901
"The bride's not a patch on me."

1575
01:51:09,095 --> 01:51:12,508
"I'm a medium and my
bride is an extra large."

1576
01:51:12,832 --> 01:51:14,539
"As big as a barge."

1577
01:51:14,901 --> 01:51:16,471
"Do you think you
have the gait of a deer?"

1578
01:51:16,703 --> 01:51:18,580
"You're the entire
herd in kilotons, I fear."

1579
01:51:18,838 --> 01:51:20,408
"Your waist is a waste of space."

1580
01:51:20,540 --> 01:51:22,144
"It takes up all the space."

1581
01:51:22,375 --> 01:51:24,013
"This isn't a match."

1582
01:51:24,277 --> 01:51:25,915
"it's a scam."

1583
01:51:26,146 --> 01:51:27,921
"And I've been stuck."

1584
01:51:28,114 --> 01:51:29,684
"In a jam."

1585
01:51:30,016 --> 01:51:31,620
"This isn't a match."

1586
01:51:31,885 --> 01:51:33,330
"it's a scam."

1587
01:51:33,853 --> 01:51:35,332
"And I've been stuck."

1588
01:51:35,722 --> 01:51:36,996
"In a jam."

1589
01:51:37,157 --> 01:51:38,761
"Now that things have
come to this pass."

1590
01:51:39,025 --> 01:51:40,732
"I'm begging you:
Let's end this farce."

1591
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:42,633
"You have nothing in
you of the wife I seek."

1592
01:51:42,796 --> 01:51:44,503
"You'll make my future
look very bleak."

1593
01:51:44,731 --> 01:51:46,233
"Such a deal will make me feel"

1594
01:51:46,633 --> 01:51:48,306
"a total heel."

1595
01:51:48,535 --> 01:51:50,014
"Marrying a woman who's a disgrace."

1596
01:51:50,236 --> 01:51:52,045
"To the entire feminine race."

1597
01:52:00,313 --> 01:52:01,485
"Get thee to a nunnery."

1598
01:52:36,382 --> 01:52:37,918
"Here's what I would like to know?'"

1599
01:52:38,084 --> 01:52:40,030
"What makes you so keen on size zero?"

1600
01:52:44,023 --> 01:52:45,434
"And take one look at your own face."

1601
01:52:45,625 --> 01:52:47,832
"You're not the Brad
Pitt of the Sindhi race."

1602
01:52:51,731 --> 01:52:53,608
"If your mother were
a little overweight."

1603
01:52:53,767 --> 01:52:55,269
"Would you change her
for someone who looked great?"

1604
01:52:55,535 --> 01:52:56,946
"Or would you end your
relationship with her?"

1605
01:52:57,137 --> 01:52:59,413
"Would you let your
love simply wither?"

1606
01:53:03,176 --> 01:53:04,211
"What's fat?"

1607
01:53:04,444 --> 01:53:06,321
"A workout can deal with that."

1608
01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:10,086
"You'll still be a misogynistic prat."

1609
01:53:10,416 --> 01:53:13,886
"A man who disses women"

1610
01:53:14,254 --> 01:53:17,599
"shames the entire nation."

1611
01:53:18,057 --> 01:53:21,527
"A man who disses women"

1612
01:53:21,895 --> 01:53:24,808
"shames the entire nation."

1613
01:53:26,833 --> 01:53:28,676
"He who shames a woman"

1614
01:53:28,868 --> 01:53:30,609
"shames his mum by implication."

1615
01:53:30,804 --> 01:53:34,115
"You're a shame to
your constellation."

1616
01:53:34,541 --> 01:53:36,145
"So what if your
face makes babies cry?"

1617
01:53:36,409 --> 01:53:38,252
"You can say nice
things and make a try."

1618
01:53:38,411 --> 01:53:42,120
"At pretending to
be part of humanity."

1619
01:53:42,849 --> 01:53:48,697
"I offer my condolences
to the house of your birth."

1620
01:53:49,689 --> 01:53:53,136
"They must regret your
turning up on the earth."

1621
01:54:08,341 --> 01:54:09,945
I won't let them insult me like that.

1622
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:11,482
Are you mad'?

1623
01:54:13,379 --> 01:54:14,414
We're on the rocks now.

1624
01:54:14,614 --> 01:54:15,991
I don't want to marry.

1625
01:54:16,482 --> 01:54:20,521
If the Arora deal is called off, your
protein shakes will also be called off.

1626
01:54:22,355 --> 01:54:23,595
Go, ask for pardon.

1627
01:54:26,659 --> 01:54:27,694
Do it for your bro.

1628
01:54:29,062 --> 01:54:29,767
Come on.

1629
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:34,878
That's it.

1630
01:54:35,969 --> 01:54:37,607
Go, Bro!

1631
01:54:40,273 --> 01:54:41,775
"I'm wrong and I confess."

1632
01:54:41,941 --> 01:54:44,615
"Girls are perfect, I'm a mess."

1633
01:54:45,144 --> 01:54:46,384
"I'm wrong and I confess."

1634
01:54:46,546 --> 01:54:49,356
"Girls are perfect, I'm a mess."

1635
01:54:50,083 --> 01:54:54,156
"Gods ultimate creation is a woman."

1636
01:54:54,921 --> 01:54:57,492
"Girls represent the
link between man and God."

1637
01:54:57,690 --> 01:54:59,567
"Girls are perfect
and I'm a stupid clod."

1638
01:54:59,826 --> 01:55:01,066
"I'm wrong and I confess."

1639
01:55:01,194 --> 01:55:03,800
"Girls are perfect, I'm a mess."

1640
01:55:16,609 --> 01:55:17,883
I'm over here, you imbecile.

1641
01:55:18,077 --> 01:55:18,680
Yes.

1642
01:55:19,045 --> 01:55:20,820
I have this to deal with
here and Bipin over there...

1643
01:55:21,447 --> 01:55:23,927
He almost ruined the deal yesterday.

1644
01:55:25,151 --> 01:55:26,789
What are you doing?

1645
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:29,964
The air-conditioning
is on so the fan...

1646
01:55:30,156 --> 01:55:31,658
Always arguing.

1647
01:55:31,824 --> 01:55:33,303
Let me get this wedding done...

1648
01:55:33,493 --> 01:55:35,200
and then <i>I'll</i> get you married,
my boysie-woysie.

1649
01:55:37,897 --> 01:55:40,935
Never mind. Show me the saris.

1650
01:55:41,668 --> 01:55:42,669
Can't do anything right.

1651
01:55:46,706 --> 01:55:47,844
How do you like this, Mummyji'?

1652
01:55:48,341 --> 01:55:50,446
I wouldn't give it to the servant.

1653
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:55,654
This is something else, Mummyji.

1654
01:55:55,982 --> 01:55:57,689
Heaven forefend.

1655
01:56:00,853 --> 01:56:02,161
<i>This one is the best, Mummy.</i>

1656
01:56:02,388 --> 01:56:04,732
What is this manure'?

1657
01:56:04,924 --> 01:56:07,598
Mummyji, why talk about
such things when you're eating.

1658
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:10,036
It's my mouth and <i>I'll</i>
use it the way I like.

1659
01:56:10,563 --> 01:56:11,871
Sloppy designer!

1660
01:56:12,598 --> 01:56:13,736
<i>Yuck, Mummy.</i>

1661
01:56:15,668 --> 01:56:21,812
Don't you yuck me, you upstart.
Come here and get yours. Come here.

1662
01:56:22,608 --> 01:56:23,643
Come here, you.

1663
01:56:24,243 --> 01:56:25,449
Come here, now.

1664
01:56:25,611 --> 01:56:26,282
MummYJ-i-

1665
01:56:26,412 --> 01:56:27,322
- Come here. Now.

1666
01:56:27,847 --> 01:56:28,848
- You're disobeying me'?

1667
01:56:29,248 --> 01:56:30,727
My lovely prince.

1668
01:56:31,117 --> 01:56:32,187
- Come here.
- No.

1669
01:56:32,352 --> 01:56:33,729
- You coming or not'?
- No, Mummyji.

1670
01:56:33,853 --> 01:56:35,389
- You coming or not'?!
- Mummyji.

1671
01:56:36,889 --> 01:56:37,560
MummYJ-i-

1672
01:57:07,887 --> 01:57:09,093
<i>Sorry Mummy.</i>

1673
01:57:13,693 --> 01:57:14,501
Mummyji'?

1674
01:57:30,843 --> 01:57:31,913
Mummyji'?

1675
01:57:45,892 --> 01:57:46,870
Mummyji'?

1676
01:58:09,816 --> 01:58:11,193
Mummy... tee hee heel.

1677
01:58:19,759 --> 01:58:20,794
Nonsense. Stop it.

1678
01:58:21,027 --> 01:58:22,836
Enough of this.

1679
01:58:23,296 --> 01:58:25,936
First we have to tell the Fundwanis.

1680
01:58:26,332 --> 01:58:27,208
No. Never.

1681
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:30,472
A death in the family
means the wedding is off.

1682
01:58:30,703 --> 01:58:33,684
If the wedding is off,
the deal is off.

1683
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:38,120
If the deal falls through,
you know what happens?

1684
01:58:41,681 --> 01:58:43,592
The lawyer is right.

1685
01:58:44,383 --> 01:58:46,124
We can't stop the wedding.

1686
01:58:46,953 --> 01:58:49,229
And then... think about Eesha.

1687
01:59:02,034 --> 01:59:02,978
What do we do'?

1688
01:59:20,086 --> 01:59:21,064
Shall we make a dash for it'?

1689
01:59:22,722 --> 01:59:24,167
This is our chance.

1690
01:59:25,391 --> 01:59:26,802
The decision is yours.

1691
01:59:28,561 --> 01:59:30,700
Whatever you decide, I'm with you.

1692
01:59:32,465 --> 01:59:33,341
Look, kiddo...

1693
01:59:33,499 --> 01:59:35,001
you don't have to compromise...

1694
01:59:37,370 --> 01:59:38,713
Looking very pretty-

1695
01:59:41,073 --> 01:59:42,848
Your father talks a lot of rot.

1696
01:59:43,876 --> 01:59:45,446
Didn't we compromise?

1697
01:59:45,945 --> 01:59:47,447
And we're still happy.

1698
01:59:48,481 --> 01:59:50,722
Girl, marriages work
only on compromises.

1699
01:59:52,151 --> 01:59:53,255
One second.

1700
01:59:56,255 --> 02:00:00,829
Just because Mummyji is gone doesn't
mean we abandon family tradition.

1701
02:00:01,394 --> 02:00:02,134
Right'?

1702
02:00:03,462 --> 02:00:05,533
We need the Fundwani funds.

1703
02:00:06,933 --> 02:00:09,709
And that Robin big-chest'?
He isn't so bad.

1704
02:00:11,137 --> 02:00:13,674
Get those bangles on.
<i>I'll</i> be right back.

1705
02:00:22,181 --> 02:00:24,183
You do not have to compromise.

1706
02:00:42,101 --> 02:00:45,480
<i>Six... seven... eight.</i>

1707
02:00:46,072 --> 02:00:46,982
Eight-and-a-half.

1708
02:00:47,306 --> 02:00:48,376
Eight-and-a-half!

1709
02:00:58,251 --> 02:00:59,491
What do we do with her'?

1710
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:02,290
We keep her alive.

1711
02:01:02,955 --> 02:01:03,558
What'?

1712
02:01:08,527 --> 02:01:09,301
Not too dark.

1713
02:01:09,462 --> 02:01:10,497
This looks sexy.

1714
02:01:15,067 --> 02:01:18,571
The ladies, the gentlemen,
I present to you...

1715
02:01:19,171 --> 02:01:20,411
the flying marital mare!

1716
02:01:44,797 --> 02:01:45,775
- Love you, bro!

1717
02:01:46,098 --> 02:01:47,941
Ma'am, red wine'?

1718
02:01:48,868 --> 02:01:50,006
Or white wine'?

1719
02:01:50,903 --> 02:01:51,540
Ma'am'?

1720
02:01:52,638 --> 02:01:55,244
Mummyji, he's asking red or white?

1721
02:01:56,342 --> 02:01:59,289
Last chance. Last time. You're sure'?

1722
02:01:59,845 --> 02:02:00,721
Think about it.

1723
02:02:01,614 --> 02:02:04,322
Guys, the family needs this to happen.

1724
02:02:04,617 --> 02:02:07,393
And maybe Robin will
change after we get married.

1725
02:02:11,324 --> 02:02:12,826
Smile, Mummyji!

1726
02:02:13,159 --> 02:02:14,103
Everything under control'?

1727
02:02:14,260 --> 02:02:16,934
Mummyji, just because you're
dead doesn't mean you can't smile.

1728
02:02:17,596 --> 02:02:19,132
Come on, Mummyji...

1729
02:02:20,132 --> 02:02:23,136
<i>One two three... smile...</i>

1730
02:02:24,203 --> 02:02:25,045
PP.

1731
02:02:30,142 --> 02:02:31,780
How are you, Kamlaji'?

1732
02:02:35,414 --> 02:02:36,256
Mummyji what a joke!

1733
02:02:39,585 --> 02:02:40,791
Come on, Mummyji, smile!

1734
02:02:41,754 --> 02:02:42,630
Hey JJ!

1735
02:02:42,855 --> 02:02:44,892
Let me take a photo, me, me.

1736
02:02:45,191 --> 02:02:46,761
Now Mummyji will smile.

1737
02:02:46,892 --> 02:02:47,427
Really'?

1738
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:49,540
- One... two... three...
- Come on, Mummyji, smile.

1739
02:02:51,364 --> 02:02:59,545
"Come my friends and sing for me,
for this night, I am a bride."

1740
02:03:02,875 --> 02:03:11,351
"The guests have arrived
and the fire has been lit."

1741
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:22,971
"I am to marry this night."

1742
02:03:27,233 --> 02:03:28,234
Oh my God!

1743
02:04:01,934 --> 02:04:03,072
Chill, Robin!

1744
02:04:26,459 --> 02:04:28,871
Alia, just unhook this'?

1745
02:04:30,930 --> 02:04:31,499
Huh?

1746
02:04:31,730 --> 02:04:32,708
Help me get this off.

1747
02:04:33,065 --> 02:04:33,770
The d u patta'?

1748
02:04:33,966 --> 02:04:34,967
Yes.

1749
02:04:36,535 --> 02:04:37,980
Are you sure'?

1750
02:04:38,304 --> 02:04:39,146
Yes, I'm sure.

1751
02:04:48,447 --> 02:04:50,358
Uncle, unhook that please.

1752
02:04:50,649 --> 02:04:51,525
- Eesha'?

1753
02:04:51,984 --> 02:04:52,894
Eesha, stop it.

1754
02:04:59,725 --> 02:05:00,829
- Unbutton me.

1755
02:05:06,365 --> 02:05:07,036
The ones at the back too.

1756
02:05:07,199 --> 02:05:07,870
Yes.

1757
02:05:08,934 --> 02:05:10,004
Please, get me out of this.

1758
02:05:12,104 --> 02:05:13,105
What are you doing?

1759
02:05:46,872 --> 02:05:47,680
Eesha?

1760
02:06:04,757 --> 02:06:05,735
God, I'm so hungry.

1761
02:06:11,630 --> 02:06:12,734
Hang on to this, Alia.

1762
02:06:14,166 --> 02:06:16,146
Look at me, look at me.

1763
02:06:18,938 --> 02:06:21,248
You're marrying me but
you can't even look at me'?

1764
02:06:22,308 --> 02:06:23,412
This is howl am.

1765
02:06:24,209 --> 02:06:26,189
And I am perfect the way I am.

1766
02:06:27,112 --> 02:06:28,284
I'm fat and I like it.

1767
02:06:28,614 --> 02:06:32,118
I love it actually and
I'm not even that fat, am I Alia'?

1768
02:06:32,785 --> 02:06:33,490
No!

1769
02:06:34,253 --> 02:06:37,791
I have lots of people in my
life who love me as I am, right Dad'?

1770
02:06:38,524 --> 02:06:39,093
Me.

1771
02:06:39,692 --> 02:06:40,329
Me too, Sis.

1772
02:06:42,561 --> 02:06:43,266
I love you.

1773
02:06:46,065 --> 02:06:49,444
So I'm going to live
my life as I like.

1774
02:06:50,069 --> 02:06:52,549
<i>I'll</i> marry someone
I choose or I won't marry.

1775
02:06:54,139 --> 02:06:55,140
I'm fat and if I choose <i>I'll</i> stay fat.

1776
02:06:55,274 --> 02:06:56,344
Or <i>I'll</i> lose weight.

1777
02:06:56,642 --> 02:06:58,121
Got it bro.

1778
02:06:58,577 --> 02:07:01,183
But as of this moment,
I reject you, Mr. Eight-Packs!

1779
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:03,088
Eight and a half.

1780
02:07:16,261 --> 02:07:16,796
What is going on'?

1781
02:07:16,996 --> 02:07:19,670
Put this on, Kiddo.

1782
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:24,906
If my daughter doesn't
want to get married...

1783
02:07:25,404 --> 02:07:27,884
no force in the world
is going to get her married.

1784
02:07:28,173 --> 02:07:28,947
Just shut up, Bipin.

1785
02:07:29,108 --> 02:07:31,315
You shut up too, Geetu.

1786
02:07:31,510 --> 02:07:33,547
Excuse me, excuse me please.

1787
02:07:34,113 --> 02:07:34,955
Full respect, boss.

1788
02:07:35,648 --> 02:07:37,821
Put this on, Daddy-O.

1789
02:07:38,017 --> 02:07:39,155
This is an insult.

1790
02:07:40,452 --> 02:07:42,955
- And what about Splendiferous'?
- One minute, please.

1791
02:07:43,255 --> 02:07:47,863
Eesha, Eesha my girl,
life is like this.

1792
02:07:48,594 --> 02:07:51,473
We often have to do
things we don't want to.

1793
02:07:52,364 --> 02:07:53,809
Please, Eesha, listen to me.

1794
02:07:54,166 --> 02:07:56,544
Eesha, child, please accept.

1795
02:07:57,002 --> 02:07:57,707
Why'?

1796
02:07:58,170 --> 02:07:59,478
Don't interfere, Vipul.

1797
02:07:59,872 --> 02:08:02,216
Why'? Do I not have feelings?

1798
02:08:02,608 --> 02:08:03,678
Don't say yes.

1799
02:08:04,109 --> 02:08:06,783
Because of all of you,
I've been living a lie.

1800
02:08:06,979 --> 02:08:08,049
What happened'?

1801
02:08:09,181 --> 02:08:13,459
- What happened, Uncle'?
- I'm... I'm... I'm...

1802
02:08:15,954 --> 02:08:18,730
- I'm gay!
- We know.

1803
02:08:19,191 --> 02:08:21,000
- You know?
- Yes.

1804
02:08:21,393 --> 02:08:22,736
I want to say something too.

1805
02:08:23,195 --> 02:08:24,196
Fm Pfeggers.

1806
02:08:24,663 --> 02:08:25,437
Preggers'?

1807
02:08:25,631 --> 02:08:26,609
Pregnant, Beeps.

1808
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:29,635
The tutor'?

1809
02:08:30,202 --> 02:08:30,942
- Ramesh.
- Ramesh.

1810
02:08:31,170 --> 02:08:33,343
- OMG, this is like
so awesome...

1811
02:08:33,472 --> 02:08:34,542
- Like totally.

1812
02:08:35,074 --> 02:08:36,553
All that work down the drain.

1813
02:08:37,309 --> 02:08:38,310
- Excuse me.

1814
02:08:38,677 --> 02:08:41,954
Now that everyone's telling
THE TRUTH: I'm illegitimate.

1815
02:08:42,414 --> 02:08:43,119
- Alia.

1816
02:08:43,716 --> 02:08:46,788
Come on Beeps, let me tell
it like it is. I am Beeps' daughter.

1817
02:08:47,019 --> 02:08:48,293
With another woman.

1818
02:08:48,554 --> 02:08:49,760
- Wow, Dad!

1819
02:08:51,190 --> 02:08:52,863
And by the way,
Sis, I'm older than you.

1820
02:08:53,125 --> 02:08:54,195
- Really.
- Yeah.

1821
02:08:55,461 --> 02:08:56,030
Yes.

1822
02:08:56,628 --> 02:08:57,698
And I'm not even a priest.

1823
02:08:57,896 --> 02:08:58,806
- No. I'm not.

1824
02:08:59,798 --> 02:09:01,141
I'm a cricket commentator.

1825
02:09:01,767 --> 02:09:05,237
Ever since Sidhu has taken
to commentary, I've been out of work.

1826
02:09:05,871 --> 02:09:08,579
So I developed this spiel.

1827
02:09:09,208 --> 02:09:10,118
<i>How'?</i>

1828
02:09:15,347 --> 02:09:19,056
The pitch puts a damper on play, the
weather will hamper the way the boys play.

1829
02:09:19,218 --> 02:09:22,961
The Lanka batsmen are on the heavy
side but they show no playing pride.

1830
02:09:23,522 --> 02:09:27,197
India bats next, the bowlers
are hexed and the batsmen are vexed.

1831
02:09:28,427 --> 02:09:29,462
Swaha...

1832
02:09:30,829 --> 02:09:33,139
Enough of this nonsense!

1833
02:09:33,999 --> 02:09:36,206
This is no joke. It's business.

1834
02:09:36,502 --> 02:09:38,675
This marriage will happen.
Or I shoot to the kill.

1835
02:09:39,772 --> 02:09:43,015
Bro, I don't want to
marry as a business deal.

1836
02:09:43,208 --> 02:09:44,084
Shut up, Robin.

1837
02:09:45,144 --> 02:09:47,488
Mummyji, what is this Mummyji'?

1838
02:09:48,847 --> 02:09:50,155
Today no smiling, no talking?

1839
02:09:50,482 --> 02:09:51,460
Someone stop him.

1840
02:09:51,617 --> 02:09:53,153
Mummyji come on say some-

1841
02:09:53,852 --> 02:09:54,387
What'?

1842
02:09:54,586 --> 02:09:55,656
Mummyji is dead.

1843
02:09:56,388 --> 02:09:56,957
What'?

1844
02:09:57,990 --> 02:09:58,627
Whaat'?'?

1845
02:09:58,891 --> 02:09:59,835
Whaaat'???

1846
02:10:00,526 --> 02:10:02,028
Whaaaat'?'?'?'?

1847
02:10:04,363 --> 02:10:09,210
Now that Mummyi is officially dead,
this wedding cannot happen.

1848
02:10:09,535 --> 02:10:12,015
We regret to announce
the cancellation...

1849
02:10:18,110 --> 02:10:22,320
This wedding will happen,
Mummyji or no Mummyji.

1850
02:10:23,982 --> 02:10:25,325
The show must go on.

1851
02:10:25,984 --> 02:10:29,557
But The Harry, this man is no priest,
he's a cricket commentator.

1852
02:10:29,755 --> 02:10:30,699
How will he marry them'?

1853
02:10:30,889 --> 02:10:32,562
- Makes no difference.

1854
02:10:32,891 --> 02:10:35,872
Once they've walked around the fire
seven times, they will be married.

1855
02:10:36,261 --> 02:10:39,435
Come on Eesha, move it.
Hansa, move. Robin.

1856
02:10:39,731 --> 02:10:40,539
Move!

1857
02:10:41,867 --> 02:10:42,641
Move, move.

1858
02:10:44,937 --> 02:10:48,749
At the feet of Muthaiya,
lies Murlidhar.

1859
02:10:51,376 --> 02:10:54,289
Oh Sanghkara, why hit so hard'?
And our little man is a tub of lard.

1860
02:10:54,580 --> 02:10:58,619
Your daughter's getting married.
Be happy.

1861
02:10:59,484 --> 02:11:01,794
And Sachin is stumped
for a way forward.

1862
02:11:03,322 --> 02:11:04,096
What is this'?

1863
02:11:05,691 --> 02:11:06,692
Good going, Robin.

1864
02:11:15,968 --> 02:11:17,606
I'm going to fire a few shots too.

1865
02:11:17,803 --> 02:11:18,713
Before the wedding.

1866
02:11:18,904 --> 02:11:19,780
Before the wedding.

1867
02:11:25,744 --> 02:11:30,750
Mummy your cannon,
the hope of the nation.

1868
02:11:33,418 --> 02:11:34,226
I didn't shoot.

1869
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:35,858
I fired.

1870
02:11:36,722 --> 02:11:38,133
No no no, not my bro.

1871
02:11:38,457 --> 02:11:41,370
Hands up. No one moves.

1872
02:11:41,994 --> 02:11:43,530
- I've always wanted to say that line.

1873
02:11:43,729 --> 02:11:46,972
ANOTHER ONE: We have you surrounded.

1874
02:11:47,699 --> 02:11:49,337
- That's just dialogue. Stay focused.

1875
02:11:49,601 --> 02:11:50,807
One more.
One more dialogue.

1876
02:11:52,204 --> 02:11:55,185
If you value your lives,
throw down your guns!

1877
02:11:57,209 --> 02:11:58,017
One more.

1878
02:11:59,912 --> 02:12:03,086
What would you know
of the value of marriage?

1879
02:12:03,548 --> 02:12:04,424
Superb.

1880
02:12:06,985 --> 02:12:12,162
That itty-bitty pistol?
Daddy-O, take it away from them.

1881
02:12:12,591 --> 02:12:15,902
No, please don't. This is... this is...

1882
02:12:16,461 --> 02:12:20,841
family possession. This is... this
is... my property, ancestral property,

1883
02:12:21,199 --> 02:12:23,645
my great grandfather
gave me this gun.

1884
02:12:28,373 --> 02:12:33,379
This is the crazy,
you are the Harry, I'm the Bipin.

1885
02:12:34,046 --> 02:12:36,151
We're all Sindhi and we speak
Sindhi and the world is Sindhi.

1886
02:12:36,281 --> 02:12:37,316
We have nothing in common.

1887
02:12:37,482 --> 02:12:38,859
- Keep it here.
- Yeah, thanks.

1888
02:12:39,318 --> 02:12:40,456
Only Sindhi.

1889
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:42,692
Like the peach!

1890
02:12:51,430 --> 02:12:52,534
- Daddy-o, let's get out of here.

1891
02:12:54,199 --> 02:12:55,007
Shall we flee'?

1892
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:56,374
Really'?

1893
02:12:57,469 --> 02:12:59,346
- Shall we run for it'?
- Let's.

1894
02:12:59,604 --> 02:13:00,048
Let's go!

1895
02:13:00,205 --> 02:13:00,945
Let's go!

1896
02:13:01,707 --> 02:13:02,708
Let's go!

1897
02:13:03,542 --> 02:13:05,351
Bro-bro-bruhhh.

1898
02:13:05,544 --> 02:13:06,921
One minute, hold on.

1899
02:13:07,145 --> 02:13:07,680
_ Run!

1900
02:13:07,813 --> 02:13:08,814
Uncle, come with us.

1901
02:13:08,947 --> 02:13:10,392
You go on ahead.
<i>I'll</i> cut them off here. Go.

1902
02:13:10,515 --> 02:13:11,516
A he-man.

1903
02:13:11,817 --> 02:13:12,921
- Thank you brother.

1904
02:13:13,485 --> 02:13:14,429
Come on, Beeps.

1905
02:13:14,853 --> 02:13:16,389
"Until night fell,
the night, the night."

1906
02:13:18,457 --> 02:13:22,303
"Then they opened a bottle of liquor."

1907
02:13:22,627 --> 02:13:23,537
"The whole thing became a mess."

1908
02:13:23,762 --> 02:13:25,833
Harry Fundwani,
<i>I'll</i> just fire on you right now.

1909
02:13:25,964 --> 02:13:26,942
No, no, no.

1910
02:13:27,366 --> 02:13:28,174
It is rather heavy.

1911
02:13:28,367 --> 02:13:29,812
That's why I'm telling you,
darling, give it to me.

1912
02:13:31,937 --> 02:13:33,041
There was only one bullet in it.

1913
02:13:34,172 --> 02:13:36,652
- Come on chase them.
- Bro!

1914
02:13:37,242 --> 02:13:40,815
"One more peg, more or less"
"And everything became a mess."

1915
02:13:42,781 --> 02:13:46,854
"Just that bottle of liquor made everyone's
heart beat that much quicker."

1916
02:14:01,600 --> 02:14:04,080
"The relatives were
hugging each other."

1917
02:14:04,336 --> 02:14:06,577
"They were acting just like brothers."

1918
02:14:11,143 --> 02:14:13,555
"The relatives were
hugging each other."

1919
02:14:13,779 --> 02:14:15,690
"They were acting just like brothers."

1920
02:14:16,348 --> 02:14:18,555
"The relatives were
hugging each other."

1921
02:14:18,784 --> 02:14:20,161
"They were acting just like brothers."

1922
02:14:20,352 --> 02:14:22,423
Daddy-o, Daddy-o!

1923
02:14:24,189 --> 02:14:28,638
Daddy-O, the helicopter.
What better moment will you get'?

1924
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:31,270
- Fly that chopper.
- Yes, come on!

1925
02:14:31,763 --> 02:14:32,503
Yes.

1926
02:14:32,864 --> 02:14:36,971
"This was no marriage, it was a deal.
And the deal was quite a steal."

1927
02:14:37,235 --> 02:14:38,612
"The whole thing became a mess."

1928
02:14:39,671 --> 02:14:41,344
"The whole thing became a mess."

1929
02:14:42,074 --> 02:14:43,883
"The whole thing became a mess."

1930
02:14:44,042 --> 02:14:45,783
- Okay, let's go.
- "The whole thing became a mess."

1931
02:15:16,475 --> 02:15:17,078
Ashok.

1932
02:15:17,309 --> 02:15:20,688
"What was supposed to be a sweet deal
Turned out to be a total steal."

1933
02:15:22,047 --> 02:15:26,189
"What was supposed to be a sweet deal
Turned out to be a total steal."

1934
02:15:26,852 --> 02:15:30,800
"Everyone's true nature was revealed."

1935
02:15:31,656 --> 02:15:35,229
"Everyone's true nature was revealed."

1936
02:15:41,299 --> 02:15:44,178
Who's going to pay me back'?

1937
02:15:45,170 --> 02:15:46,945
- Hey... wow.
- We're good.

1938
02:15:48,573 --> 02:15:49,608
We made it.

1939
02:15:50,742 --> 02:15:52,517
Alia, it's Uncle Vipul.

1940
02:16:02,454 --> 02:16:03,524
Safe.

1941
02:16:06,324 --> 02:16:07,064
I'm sorry.

1942
02:16:08,660 --> 02:16:09,536
Sorry.

1943
02:16:09,928 --> 02:16:11,930
It's ok, it doesn't matter, chill.

1944
02:16:15,634 --> 02:16:17,079
Set me down anywhere you like.

1945
02:16:17,302 --> 02:16:19,407
- Where do I set you down'?
- <i>I'll</i> throw you out.

1946
02:16:20,172 --> 02:16:22,174
Your bro isn't going to be happy.

1947
02:16:23,141 --> 02:16:24,779
Bro will be busy paying his debts.

1948
02:16:25,143 --> 02:16:26,588
<i>- Huh'?
- Debt'?</i>

1949
02:16:27,779 --> 02:16:28,814
My bro is bankrupt.

1950
02:16:28,947 --> 02:16:30,290
- Bankrupt?
- He's skint.

1951
02:16:31,049 --> 02:16:32,187
What we had left,
we put into the wedding.

1952
02:16:32,350 --> 02:16:34,591
Now he won't even be able
to pay for my protein shakes.

1953
02:16:35,353 --> 02:16:38,800
So you lot were in
the same state as we were.

1954
02:16:41,126 --> 02:16:41,900
Shut up!

1955
02:16:43,862 --> 02:16:44,738
Look straight ahead.

1956
02:16:45,630 --> 02:16:46,973
The fool wants protein shakes.

1957
02:16:47,666 --> 02:16:48,576
Where to, Beeps'?

1958
02:16:49,234 --> 02:16:50,269
Far far away.

1959
02:16:51,236 --> 02:16:52,476
What'll we do there'?

1960
02:16:52,971 --> 02:16:53,949
We'll live!

1961
02:16:55,106 --> 02:16:56,278
And sleep.

1962
02:16:57,042 --> 02:16:57,713
<i>Oye .</i>

1963
02:17:01,046 --> 02:17:01,888
A dream'?

1964
02:17:02,614 --> 02:17:03,991
Beeps did this one'? Show me'?

1965
02:17:04,916 --> 02:17:06,088
It's between us.

1966
02:17:06,985 --> 02:17:07,759
Thank you, Papaji.

1967
02:17:08,453 --> 02:17:09,659
Mention not.

1968
02:17:11,923 --> 02:17:16,497
And that was how Bipin took
his two daughters, one son-in-law...

1969
02:17:16,795 --> 02:17:23,212
and one eight-and-a-half packs
specimen and managed a clean getaway,

1970
02:17:24,202 --> 02:17:29,914
He got away from a Splendiferous deal
and flew away to a splendiferous life.

1971
02:17:29,938 --> 02:17:44,938
