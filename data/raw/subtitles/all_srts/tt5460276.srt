1
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,667
Hello, Rohan. Good morning!

2
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,167
Mrs. Mukherjee, good morning.

3
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,708
-How are you?
-I am fine.

4
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,292
So? Excited?

5
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:33,292
Can't you hear the excitement
in my voice?

6
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:36,208
Rohan, please be there at 10:45.

7
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:38,208
I will be there on time, don't worry.

8
00:01:38,292 --> 00:01:39,125
Ok.

9
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,082
But, it would be better if
you could be there, Mrs. Mukherjee.

10
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:44,500
I mean, since you've set up everything.

11
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:46,916
So, if you could make it,
it would be very nice.

12
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:49,792
Why, Rohan? Are you
scared of a girl?

13
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:55,875
If I had to lie, then no.
But, honestly, a little bit.

14
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:58,417
I guess it's probably because
it's the first time.

15
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,667
Rohan, is someone going along with you?

16
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,417
Yes. The one and only, Zafar.

17
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,042
Oh ok... good!

18
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,292
All the best, then!

19
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,208
-Yes, Mrs. Mukherjee. Thank you!
-Ok, Rohan.

20
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:09,792
-I'll see you. Bye.
-Bye.

21
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:42,958
Hey Percy, what happened?

22
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,292
-Has the chain come off again?
-Yes.

23
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,750
Your old cycle will
never get a new twist!

24
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,292
Yes.

25
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:50,542
So what do we do?

26
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:51,625
Fix it, please.

27
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:58,667
Tell your dad to buy you
a new cycle now.

28
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,583
Rohan uncle, you know my father.

29
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:04,375
He hasn't changed his
father's vintage Lambretta yet.

30
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,958
-My cycle stands no chance.
-Your father is a typical Parsi.

31
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:08,792
-Hold the bike.
-Yes.

32
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:10,708
Good.

33
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:12,458
It's high time you learnt how to fix this.

34
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:14,750
-Yes.
-I've shown it to you so many times.

35
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,250
Let's test it.

36
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:27,833
All set.

37
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:28,917
Yes!

38
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,250
Thanks, Rohan.

39
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:31,792
-You are welcome.
-Wow. You are the best.

40
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:34,667
Tell me, how do you ride a bike?

41
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:36,667
With faith and confidence.

42
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:42,000
When you have these, you don't
need to see the road ahead. Remember that.

43
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,000
-Yes.
-Papa is here.

44
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,083
Good morning, Cyrus.

45
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,542
Son, how do you catch me everyday
without even seeing me?

46
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,292
Do you have a code locked
in your nose for everyone?

47
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,250
Mutton curry, Cyrus.
Your code.

48
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,250
-See you in the evening, Percy.
-Yes.

49
00:03:55,874 --> 00:03:57,041
Mutton curry.

50
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,208
Is she here?

51
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,375
Tell me.

52
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,042
Brother...

53
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:17,750
You are quite fair.

54
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:19,750
But, she is even fairer.

55
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,999
Your kids will look like foreigners.

56
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:25,958
Here...

57
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:32,125
-Hello. Hi.
-Hi.

58
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,542
I am Rohan Bhatnagar.

59
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:34,958
Sorry, I am late.

60
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,458
It's all right.

61
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:39,375
This is Supriya... Supriya Sharma.

62
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:40,417
Hi.

63
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,625
And I am Geeta Sanyal.

64
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,875
Hello.

65
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:45,333
It's best if Rohan and
Supriya sit here,

66
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:47,250
you and I can sit there.

67
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:49,083
One particular snack
is very famous here.

68
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,208
Rohan, shall I ask for
an extra helping for you?

69
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,500
No...

70
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,708
I'll order some for you too,
my dear sister-in-law.

71
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:56,875
You come, please.

72
00:04:58,667 --> 00:04:59,499
Ok.

73
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,375
I am so sorry.

74
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:06,792
Sometimes Zafar speaks nonsense.

75
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,000
I hope you don't mind.

76
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,250
It's all right.

77
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:21,833
By the way, every time
Mrs. Mukherjee mentions you

78
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,250
she's all praises.

79
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,291
Has she said anything about me?

80
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,833
Yes, so often that I could not
think of anyone else but you...

81
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,125
if I wanted to get married.

82
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,000
What do you mean?

83
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:39,375
I owe a lot to Mrs. Mukherjee.

84
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,208
I am here because she insisted.

85
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,208
Actually, I don't ever
want to get married.

86
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,583
Please turn down this proposal.

87
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:49,875
Any excuse will do.

88
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,375
Like?

89
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:55,000
Like... you didn't like me.

90
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,250
That means...

91
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,250
I have to lie in spite of not wanting to.

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,458
Rohan, I work.

93
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:03,792
I earn a living.

94
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,708
I don't depend on anyone.

95
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:10,250
But, in real life how can two negatives
make a positive?

96
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,625
Actually,

97
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,833
it's funny because...

98
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,667
I don't want to get married either.

99
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,250
Then... why?

100
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:23,832
The same... Mrs. Mukherjee's pressures.

101
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,250
Yes.

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,958
But...

103
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,458
in just this meeting,
I have learnt that...

104
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,833
you are not just confident
but also very independent.

105
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,583
And I think that's...
that's really amazing.

106
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:44,500
Thank you.

107
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,625
Can I say something, Su?

108
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:57,792
A man's self-confidence is his strength.

109
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,833
You and I... we are not weak.

110
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,833
Then why are you so afraid
of walking with me?

111
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,250
Because darkness cannot
 light up darkness, Rohan.

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,167
Right.

113
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:20,125
But having someone
with you in the darkness...

114
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:25,042
can make it seem less daunting.

115
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:28,333
I am confused.

116
00:07:28,624 --> 00:07:30,499
Do you want to get married or not?

117
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,875
I do.

118
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:35,375
But, not yet.

119
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:37,500
I want to give you some time.

120
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,042
Just to be sure.

121
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,542
Of you... of me.

122
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,667
Of us.

123
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:49,875
So, you know...

124
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,125
Let's... let's just see.

125
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,417
Would you like some tea?

126
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,708
Yes.

127
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,583
My friend has done it.

128
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,958
Look at their approving smiles...
it's a yes!

129
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:07,667
Congratulations on the wedding!

130
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:11,417
Welcome the Lord Ganesha!

131
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,708
Welcome this beautiful Lord!

132
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,250
Oh sweet Lord... welcome!

133
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,167
Lord Ganpati!

134
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,083
Welcome!

135
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,625
Oh sweet Lord...

136
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,250
Welcome!

137
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:35,833
Welcome the Lord Ganesha.

138
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,167
So, shall we meet tomorrow?

139
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,417
When? Where?

140
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:58,792
Why?

141
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:01,833
If you want to be sure,

142
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,708
it's important to meet every day.
Isn't it, Su?

143
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,875
Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday
I am at the dance studio.

144
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:11,792
You dance, too?

145
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,708
I play the piano and
students dance.

146
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,332
You literally make people
dance to your tunes.

147
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,250
I get it now.

148
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,750
Rohan...

149
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:24,792
bye!

150
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:28,833
Bye, Su.

151
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:34,291
-Shall we go?
-Handsome!

152
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:36,375
Hey, is it your birthday today?

153
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:37,500
New clothes and all?

154
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,917
Shall I send you
some cake and wafers?

155
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,167
Yes, send them.

156
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:41,875
Son of a...

157
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,708
I've heard that love is blind.

158
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,583
But, the blind falling in love,

159
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,083
now that's new to me.

160
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:07,792
That was nice.

161
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,708
I know it's simple but I couldn't.

162
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:11,166
-Yes, please?
-Is Supriya here?

163
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,458
Yes. There she is.

164
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,375
-Can you...?
-Sure. I'll take you.

165
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:15,583
You guys go. I'll come.

166
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:18,708
-Supriya?
-Yes?

167
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,583
Your friend is here.

168
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:21,833
Hi.

169
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,375
Rohan!

170
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:25,625
Surprised or shocked?

171
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,958
Pleasantly surprised.

172
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:29,417
Thank God.

173
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:31,375
Sit.

174
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,458
There's... There's a stool...

175
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:35,542
Good... thanks.

176
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:37,917
How are you?

177
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:39,167
I am good.

178
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:44,292
So, till what time is this dance class?

179
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,625
I think this is the last session.

180
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,250
Coffee afterwards?

181
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,083
Yes. Sure.

182
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:52,625
Ok.

183
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,125
Let's take a five-minute break.

184
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:58,708
Su?

185
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,500
-Yes?
-You don't dance?

186
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,000
I dance.

187
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,167
You dance well?

188
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,917
I think I dance quite well.

189
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,499
-Really?
-Yes.

190
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,625
And you?

191
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,708
Actually, I...

192
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:17,292
Su, what is the size of this dance floor?

193
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:18,999
40 by 40.

194
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,416
So, square.

195
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,583
Any levels?

196
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:23,750
One.

197
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:24,791
And...

198
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,542
why do you ask that?

199
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:31,666
Because I feel like...
we should try.

200
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,542
-What?
-Yes.

201
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,833
Are you asking me to dance with you?

202
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,667
Yes, I am.

203
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,708
Rohan, are you mad?

204
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,125
What will people think?

205
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,792
If we start thinking
what people will think...

206
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,500
then, what will they think of us?
Su, come.

207
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,292
-Rohan, you are...
-Come.

208
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,417
Er... where are you going?

209
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,792
Oh, sorry.
Where is the floor?

210
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Here.

211
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,708
I thought you were joking.

212
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,875
Hey, Supriya.
Where are you going?

213
00:11:56,457 --> 00:11:57,582
That's my friend, Rohan.

214
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,583
He wants to explore the dance floor.

215
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,417
Oh, cool.

216
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,792
Shall I play the track?

217
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,875
Yes. Yes, please. Thanks.

218
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:08,833
Where does the level start from?

219
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:10,208
Right here.

220
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,667
"When our"

221
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:19,499
"Steps align"

222
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:29,708
"Our journey begins"

223
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:38,917
"And wherever we walk together"

224
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:46,958
"The world will walk with us"

225
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:22,500
"My love"

226
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,333
"My love"

227
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:36,167
"Give yourself into my arms"

228
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:40,250
"Like a cloud gives
Into the breeze"

229
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,292
"My love"

230
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:50,832
"Give yourself into my arms"

231
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:54,750
"Like a cloud gives
Into the breeze"

232
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,374
"When we walk together"

233
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,333
"To the same beat"

234
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,417
"For where we walk"

235
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,625
"There many will gather"

236
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:07,375
"The earth cries out in joy"

237
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,667
"My love"

238
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,958
"Let's gather all our dreams
In our eyes today"

239
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:47,167
"Let's make happiness our own"

240
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:55,458
"Let's gather all our dreams
In our eyes today"

241
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:59,000
"Let's make happiness our own"

242
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:03,458
"Listen, love"

243
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:07,458
"Let's have some more fun"

244
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:09,833
"Say 1-2-3-4"

245
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:11,917
"My love"

246
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:17,708
"Give yourself into my arms"

247
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:21,625
"Like a cloud gives
Into the breeze"

248
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:24,417
"When we walk together"

249
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:26,291
"To the same beat"

250
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,250
"For wherever we go"

251
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,542
"There many will gather"

252
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:35,000
"The earth cries out in joy"

253
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,625
"My love"

254
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:45,042
"Move to the rhythm, my love
I see you with my heart"

255
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:48,792
"Move to the rhythm, my love
I see you with my heart"

256
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:52,167
"My love"

257
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,167
"Move to the rhythm, my love
I see you with my heart"

258
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,458
"My love"

259
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:02,042
"Move to the rhythm, my love
I see you with my heart"

260
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,000
Rohan, enough.

261
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,708
How many shoes are you
going to make me try?

262
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,542
One more, Su.
One more.

263
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:40,667
Su, this is the one.

264
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,583
Why?

265
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:44,292
What is right about this one?

266
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,125
This one has the right tone.

267
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,250
When you wear this,
I will know how close you are.

268
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,833
Or how far!

269
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,292
Come, I think we should
 buy this one.

270
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,750
Yes, please.

271
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:01,250
Rohan, it's a lot more crowded today.

272
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,708
Just a minute.

273
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,667
-What happened?
-It is very crowded.

274
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:10,042
Su, there is no need for this.

275
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,000
Ladies and gentlemen!

276
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,250
I am with you.

277
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,292
Come.

278
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,833
-Su, I feel hungry.
-Yes?

279
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:20,041
-Yes.
-Let's go to the food court.

280
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,000
It's on the first floor.

281
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,333
-Excuse me, where's the escalator?
-There.

282
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,500
Put your hands together
and please welcome

283
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,875
none other than... Mr. Vikram Khanna!

284
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:35,917
Thank you!

285
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:37,667
Rohan!

286
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,125
Excuse me, sir.

287
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,167
Su!

288
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,833
Guys, hold on one second please.

289
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:45,125
Stop pushing guys, please!

290
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,375
Rohan...

291
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,625
What are you doing?
One second, please.

292
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:49,875
What happened?

293
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,333
I need to go down.

294
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:52,667
Wait, you cannot go down.

295
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:53,667
Su!

296
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:56,750
-Give me some space!
-Su!

297
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:57,667
Rohan!

298
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,458
Excuse me.

299
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,583
Excuse me, is there a lady here?

300
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,667
She is blind too, just like me.

301
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:04,583
Why don't you go
to the help desk, please?

302
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,042
-Let's go.
-Where is the help desk?

303
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,042
-Move aside.
-Excuse me...

304
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:08,958
Excuse me...

305
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:10,333
Sorry... excuse me.

306
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:13,292
Excuse me, sir, can you help me?

307
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,583
I need to get to the help desk.

308
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,250
Sorry, buddy. I have no idea.

309
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:19,083
Excuse me.

310
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:20,125
Tell me.

311
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,542
Excuse me, I cannot find my friend.

312
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,542
Like me, he too cannot see.
Please help me.

313
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,250
Sorry, madam.
There is no one here.

314
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,333
Please call a security person.

315
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Security...

316
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,500
Let me look... hang on.

317
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,167
-His name is Rohan. Hello...
-You wait here.

318
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,833
Here we have Vikram for you.

319
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:46,792
Come on, Vikram.

320
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,625
We are dying to hear you.

321
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:50,917
Tell us about your new film.

322
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:54,500
Every love story has
action and emotion.

323
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,958
But, this love story has such a twist

324
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:01,042
that no one here would've ever seen it.

325
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,375
Excuse me.

326
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,667
So, let's hear it for Kahaani Pyaar Ki.

327
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:11,125
Excuse me, is the stage this way?

328
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,542
Excuse me!

329
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,417
Excuse me.
Can you help me, please?

330
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:20,458
Excuse me!

331
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:22,875
Can you help me?

332
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,333
Just a minute, guys.

333
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:26,167
Security.

334
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,208
I have been looking for my friend
for a very long time.

335
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,542
She is lost.

336
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:31,625
Can you help me?

337
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:32,792
You have a mic.

338
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:36,375
If you announce her name on the mic...
It will help me.

339
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,417
Get him on stage.

340
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:39,958
-Thank you.
-Please come.

341
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:43,250
Such passion.

342
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,750
Is she a friend or your girlfriend?

343
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,667
Please, if you could take her name...

344
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,208
Make the announcement yourself.

345
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,500
Your love story comes first,
then mine.

346
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:51,542
Here.

347
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:53,125
Turn around.

348
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,542
Su...

349
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,375
Where are you, Su?

350
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,042
Can you hear me, Su?

351
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:14,917
I am sorry, Su.

352
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,167
I don't know how my hand let go.

353
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,042
I am on the stage
at the center of this mall.

354
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,167
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Yes?

355
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,792
Will you take me
to the stage, please?

356
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,125
Sure, please come.

357
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:31,958
Su.

358
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,083
Rohan.

359
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,750
Su.

360
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:02,375
Are you ok?

361
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,500
I am ok.

362
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,000
I am sorry, Su.

363
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:08,542
Let's go.

364
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:10,833
Come on.

365
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,458
Thank you!

366
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,625
All the best, buddy.
Have a good life.

367
00:21:17,124 --> 00:21:18,124
Thank you!

368
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,583
Were you crying?

369
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,292
-Not at all.
-Really?

370
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,375
Rohan,

371
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:37,000
you can let go of my hand now.
I am not going anywhere.

372
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,125
Su.

373
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,333
Yes.

374
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:46,917
There was never light.

375
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:53,000
But, I felt true darkness
for the first time today.

376
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,417
I've always lived alone.

377
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:04,583
But today, I felt loneliness
for the first time.

378
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,917
What are you doing?

379
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,583
I am looking at you
by touching you.

380
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,625
I've seen you without touching you.

381
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,125
-What?
-Yes.

382
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,207
How so?

383
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:25,333
That day... at the restaurant.

384
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:28,917
And, to tell you the truth,

385
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,417
it was love at first sight.

386
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:46,458
Rohan, please tell me.

387
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,542
You are scaring me now.

388
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,167
Where are we going?

389
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:52,333
Home.

390
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:53,833
What?

391
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,708
Our new home.

392
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,792
We've reached.

393
00:22:58,625 --> 00:22:59,833
Come, come.

394
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:02,875
-Hello.
-Yes, darling?

395
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,875
-Where are you?
-Where am I?

396
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,083
Floating high above the ground...

397
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:09,625
-but just below the skies.
-What do you mean?

398
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,125
I've come to show sister-in-law
the new house.

399
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,583
But what will she see?

400
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,833
That's what I want to see.

401
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,042
-Zafar, what are you doing?
-What happened?

402
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:20,542
Where's your attention?

403
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:22,125
Look down!

404
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:25,583
What happened?

405
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,042
What is this?

406
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:29,708
The elevator shaft.

407
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,458
Service lift.

408
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:34,333
Sixteen steps and then this hole.

409
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,832
-Remember.
-Yes.

410
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,875
It's a construction site.

411
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,333
Be careful.

412
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,458
If I had fallen from here who knows...

413
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:46,042
whether I would reach heaven or not.

414
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,500
Thank you, bro.

415
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,708
I suggest you wear this.

416
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:50,958
A harness.

417
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:52,125
It's perfect for you.

418
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,333
Rohan...

419
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:58,083
Su, this is our main door.

420
00:24:00,624 --> 00:24:01,457
Welcome.

421
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,583
Come sister-in-law, come.

422
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,208
This is your living room.

423
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:10,625
-Which is the size of my entire house.
-Shh...

424
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,042
Rohan,

425
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:30,082
we won't put a lot of furniture in
our living room. Ok?

426
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:31,417
Ok. Yes.

427
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,917
Just basics.

428
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:35,167
And a swing in the balcony.

429
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:36,625
-Perfect.
-Isn't it?

430
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:38,667
And lots of candles.

431
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,874
-Candles?
-Yes. Scented ones.

432
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:42,667
I love scented candles.

433
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:44,333
Really?

434
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:47,542
Come here. I think you will love this.

435
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:49,042
-Come.
-What?

436
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:50,000
The sun...

437
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:52,667
wait... I think...

438
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,625
in the evening, the sun sets here.

439
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,417
And every time, a sweet breeze blows...

440
00:24:59,292 --> 00:25:00,333
-There.
-Yes.

441
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,708
-Feel it.
-Yes.

442
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:02,667
It's beautiful.

443
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:05,250
Wow.

444
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:08,958
Su,

445
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:13,000
it feels as though in real life too,

446
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:15,958
two negatives are
going to make a positive.

447
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,833
Really?
Using my own words against me?

448
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:22,667
But actually, Rohan.

449
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:26,333
I have never even dreamt
of such things.

450
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,458
I was afraid.

451
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:34,083
No, Su.

452
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:35,917
Dream them.

453
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:37,917
Dream more.

454
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:40,792
Make them big, Su.

455
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:43,292
Don't hold yourself back.

456
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,917
Because now my goal
in life is just this;

457
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:50,333
to make myself capable enough,

458
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:55,125
to fulfill every dream of yours.

459
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:13,125
"All our dreams"

460
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:17,875
"All our dreams"

461
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:20,750
"Locked behind shut eyes"

462
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:23,292
"Where do we find the key?"

463
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,875
"It's in the chalice of the moon"

464
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:29,000
"And yet, if I make dreams come true"

465
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:32,125
"Will you tell me"

466
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,375
"Am I worthy of your love?"

467
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:37,458
"Or am I not?"

468
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,833
"Am I worthy of your love?"

469
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:42,833
"Or am I not?"

470
00:27:15,292 --> 00:27:18,000
"This mischief, this fun"

471
00:27:18,082 --> 00:27:22,249
"This is our way"

472
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:28,708
"How do I explain?"

473
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:32,125
"For it is life's secret!"

474
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:36,667
"This heart doesn't beat here"

475
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,583
"Just your voice echoes here now"

476
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:45,667
"This is the beginning
Of all our joys!"

477
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,917
"All our dreams"

478
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,625
"Locked behind shut eyes"

479
00:27:52,708 --> 00:27:55,292
"Where do we find the key?"

480
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:57,875
"It's in the chalice of the moon"

481
00:27:57,958 --> 00:28:00,917
"And yet, if I make dreams come true"

482
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:04,166
"Will you tell me"

483
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,333
"Am I worthy of your love?"

484
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:09,458
"Or am I not?"

485
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:11,833
"Am I worthy of your love?"

486
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:14,833
"Or am I not?"

487
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:31,458
"When my fingers draw a heart
In the soft sands"

488
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:42,375
"It will call your name
These bangles will quiver"

489
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:49,042
"Your charms are like
That of soaring butterflies"

490
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:55,125
"These colors of joy
Will not fade"

491
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,208
"All our dreams"

492
00:28:59,292 --> 00:29:02,000
"Locked behind shut eyes"

493
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,708
"Where do we find the key?"

494
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:07,208
"It's in the chalice of the moon"

495
00:29:07,292 --> 00:29:10,250
"And yet, if I make dreams come true"

496
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:13,458
"Will you tell me"

497
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:16,458
"Am I worthy of your love?"

498
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:18,792
"Or am I not?"

499
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:21,750
"Am I worthy of your love?"

500
00:29:21,874 --> 00:29:24,166
"Or am I not?"

501
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:35,625
Parveen knows all your
rituals and customs.

502
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,667
She has even decorated
your bedroom.

503
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,124
Zafar... thanks!

504
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,292
Don't be silly.

505
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:43,625
-Listen...
-Yes?

506
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:45,708
I've got a special gift for you.

507
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:47,375
What?

508
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:50,000
Balloons...

509
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:51,417
Condom.

510
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,333
Not in front of everyone.

511
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:54,250
What are you doing?

512
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,250
No one is watching.

513
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:56,417
You are insane.

514
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,750
-Don't worry, everyone's busy eating.
-You're crazy!

515
00:29:58,833 --> 00:29:59,917
Listen, anyway...

516
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:01,667
in India, whether it is
an election or a marriage,

517
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,458
everyone wants results
in the first year.

518
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:04,958
But, you don't rush.

519
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,333
There are a lot of children
in the colony already.

520
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:09,000
You take your time.

521
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,125
You are absolutely mad.

522
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:12,958
How long?

523
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:16,875
Hang on. I am coming.

524
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:18,250
Hurry up.

525
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:20,041
The siren has gone off?

526
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:22,375
The party will leave now?

527
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:23,542
Yes. Where to?

528
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:26,042
Amit has planned a party.

529
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,375
Son, Wasim,

530
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:29,375
your best friend,

531
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:33,042
Amit, is the legislator's
younger brother,

532
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:35,458
and we are butchers.

533
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:39,125
If we cut meat every day, we eat.

534
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:41,042
You have to come to the shop
tomorrow onwards.

535
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:42,375
-No excuses.
-I will come.

536
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:43,792
I am leaving now, father.

537
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:46,875
Where did brother go?

538
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,625
He has left with his childhood buddy.

539
00:30:50,707 --> 00:30:52,082
Wasim, tell me something.

540
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,708
In the blind couple's
first night together,

541
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:57,500
will the lights be on or off?

542
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:59,625
Bro, I don't know about the lights.

543
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:01,500
But, the fan will be turned on for sure.

544
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,458
Why?

545
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,167
It's going to be very hot.

546
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,375
Amit, how do the blind...?

547
00:31:13,542 --> 00:31:14,583
What?

548
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,833
I mean... without seeing...

549
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,250
Simple... by touch and feel.

550
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:28,167
Candles.

551
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:29,792
You remembered?

552
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:31,417
No.

553
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,167
Are there candles?

554
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,375
I don't know how they got here.

555
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,208
Really? Liar!

556
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:41,167
Su, you've completed me.

557
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,583
How can I leave
any of your desires unfulfilled?

558
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:49,333
I can't see but I can feel.

559
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:51,708
Everything is so beautiful.

560
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:56,583
What are you doing?

561
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:57,875
I feel ticklish.

562
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:44,417
I won't let that happen.

563
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,750
Hands up, Romeo!

564
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:48,292
Who is that?

565
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:49,958
Don't worry, baby.

566
00:32:50,042 --> 00:32:50,875
Save me!

567
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:53,083
No! No!

568
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:54,708
You can't do that, Romeo!

569
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:56,500
It's a sin... a sin!

570
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:59,542
If you do that, I'll have
a heart attack, Romeo.

571
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,292
I... I...

572
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:03,333
I've got a heart attack, Romeo!

573
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:05,667
I've got a heart attack now.

574
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:09,208
Aunty, control your emotions.

575
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:14,375
Mumma...

576
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:21,417
Game... ha-ha... over!

577
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:25,292
-How was that?
-Fantastic.

578
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:26,458
Ok.

579
00:33:27,124 --> 00:33:28,249
Amazing.

580
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:30,375
How does he dub
without seeing the video?

581
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:32,292
That too, while switching
between so many voices.

582
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:33,708
Are you sure he is blind?

583
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:35,875
He listens in English
and speaks in Hindi.

584
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:37,833
-You know...
-Brilliant!

585
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,083
-Hello.
-Su, Hi!

586
00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:42,750
Guess who's in the studio today.

587
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:44,792
If you don't tell me,
how would I know?

588
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:45,708
Who is it?

589
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:47,250
Talk to him.
And guess who it is.

590
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,917
Hello, Supriya-ji.

591
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,375
How are you?

592
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,542
Who is this?

593
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,500
I am Amitabh Bachchan.

594
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,292
Rohan's friend.

595
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:00,875
How are you?

596
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:04,167
Amit-ji... is that you?

597
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,625
Namaste.

598
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,667
Ever since Rohan has met me,

599
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,500
he has been constantly
praising your beauty.

600
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:13,792
He hasn't said any such thing to me.

601
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:15,792
All men are the same.

602
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:18,458
They never say anything
to their wives.

603
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,458
Jaya-ji has the same complaint.

604
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:25,042
Yes, thank you. Thank you, Amit-ji.

605
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:26,458
Bless you.

606
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:30,458
May you have a
happy married life.

607
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:33,875
I take your leave
with these good wishes.

608
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:37,375
Rohan, did you hear that?

609
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:39,167
Amit-ji has blessed us so generously.

610
00:34:39,792 --> 00:34:43,083
Does Aamir Khan come to your studio?

611
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:46,208
Not just Aamir, I'll get all the
Khans for dinner tonight.

612
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,125
Ok?

613
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:48,250
But, listen,

614
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:50,167
we are eating out tonight.

615
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,875
-Ok?
-Bye.

616
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:53,333
Bye. See you.

617
00:34:57,542 --> 00:34:58,458
Do you know, Su?

618
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:00,750
I now know how it feels

619
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,042
to feel hot even
when it's air conditioned.

620
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:05,917
You gave me such
a huge love bite last night.

621
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,417
Huge?

622
00:35:07,542 --> 00:35:08,375
I am a dubbing artist.

623
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:10,625
It's the first time a dubbing artist
was left speechless.

624
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:12,583
Ever since Anup pointed it out,

625
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:15,417
I've been walking around
with my shirt buttoned till the top.

626
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,625
Can you imagine?

627
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:18,583
But, who started it?

628
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:19,708
You.

629
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:21,583
Me?

630
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,667
Oh God. What lies!

631
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:24,083
Oh, lies?

632
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,292
You know, Dastoor auntie
met me in the morning

633
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,625
and took all the details.

634
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:29,667
No way!

635
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,875
And then she related
the history of her love bites

636
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:33,792
that she got 15 years ago.

637
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:35,083
Mrs. Dastoor?

638
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:36,500
Love bites?

639
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:37,583
-Can you imagine?
-Oh God.

640
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,250
By the way,

641
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:42,125
I've been wearing a scarf
around my neck since this morning.

642
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,292
Su, please give me your hand.

643
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,500
Your left hand.

644
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,000
The time is nine o'clock p.m.

645
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,167
I bought it with my first salary.

646
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:11,875
I will wear both.

647
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,833
One watch will tell me the time,

648
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:15,958
and the other, your love.

649
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:26,375
How much?

650
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:27,375
80 rupees, sir.

651
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:28,792
-80 rupees?
-Yes, sir.

652
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:33,042
Here's a 100.

653
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:34,208
Thank you, sir.

654
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:44,375
Are you fooling me
or testing me?

655
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:45,292
What happened, sir?

656
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:46,792
-It's 80 rupees, right?
-Yes, sir.

657
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:48,125
Why are you giving me
back just 10?

658
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,208
Give me 20.

659
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,292
Sorry, sir.

660
00:36:51,917 --> 00:36:53,292
It happened because I was in a rush.

661
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:54,708
Here.

662
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,708
-What happened?
-It's fine now.

663
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:01,917
Let's go.

664
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:06,000
You know, Supriya-ji...

665
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:07,417
That auto rickshaw driver

666
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:08,542
was trying to fool me.

667
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:10,375
I knew it was you as Mr. Bachchan!

668
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,708
Mr. Dubbing Artist!

669
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:13,042
Using my words against me?

670
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,833
No, seriously.

671
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,292
You are quite smart,
I better watch out.

672
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:19,792
That, I am...

673
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:21,667
Who is it?

674
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:24,333
Amit?

675
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:25,417
It's you, right?

676
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,667
What is it, Rohan?

677
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,667
I am scared. Let's go.

678
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,958
There is no need to be afraid, Su.

679
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:31,292
I know him.

680
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:33,417
Don't play hide-n-seek, Amit?

681
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:35,167
If you want to say something,
come forward.

682
00:37:36,042 --> 00:37:37,875
I have to hand it to you, Rohan.

683
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:40,583
How do you know who it is?

684
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,541
You have a dangerous nose.

685
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:45,167
Get out of the way.

686
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:47,000
Make up your mind.

687
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:48,375
Sometimes you tell me
to come forward.

688
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:49,666
Sometimes you tell me
to get out of the way.

689
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,625
Get out of the way!

690
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,375
Ok. I've moved out of the way. Go!

691
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:02,125
Listen buddy, I have to ask you
something very important.

692
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:06,792
Even after trying really hard,
I am unable to score with a maid.

693
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:09,833
You've managed a fine target
even in the dark.

694
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:11,625
Show some respect.

695
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,000
She is my wife.

696
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:13,917
Get it?

697
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,125
Rohan, let go of my collar.

698
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:22,208
Oh! What's this?

699
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,583
Look, Wasim.

700
00:38:25,292 --> 00:38:26,917
Looks like our handsome man

701
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,917
enacted an entire porn film last night.

702
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,625
You don't say!

703
00:38:30,707 --> 00:38:35,207
Did you give her a love bite too?

704
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:37,167
Where did you give it?

705
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,250
No, don't tell me.

706
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:41,083
I'll find it myself.

707
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:43,875
Rohan!

708
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:46,083
Rohan!

709
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:47,667
Don't think I am weak.

710
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:49,125
I am telling you this once.

711
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:50,917
Don't ever forget!

712
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:52,542
Don't think I am weak.

713
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:54,500
Shilu auntie, sister Mhatre,

714
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,583
Mrs. Shirke, come everyone.

715
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:00,083
What's wrong, Supriya?

716
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,375
Why are you yelling?

717
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,375
These boys are
misbehaving with us.

718
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,792
But there's no one here
besides the two of you.

719
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,833
They were right here.

720
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:10,749
Rohan?

721
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:12,250
Where did they go?

722
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:13,458
They've gone, Su.

723
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,875
They've gone.

724
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:22,583
Let's go home.

725
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:30,167
-Look, I don't care.
-Yes...

726
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,458
What did you tell me
while booking the flat?

727
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:33,332
Yes... I remember.

728
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:35,083
-That you will hand it over in December.
-Yes, I did.

729
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,167
Then how can you tell me
that I'll get it next year?

730
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,458
The papers are still being processed.

731
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,792
-What paper, Rajesh?
-Listen...

732
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:42,292
Rajesh...

733
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:44,667
I don't care.

734
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:47,792
Either give me possession of the flat
in a month or return my money.

735
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:48,708
That's it.

736
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:50,749
-I'll... talk to the boss.
-Yes.

737
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:51,833
Don't worry. I'll sort it out.

738
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,417
Yes, thank you.

739
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:55,542
What are you doing, Su?

740
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:58,333
What I should have done last night

741
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,250
when you slapped that man.

742
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:03,667
Then why didn't you?

743
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:09,375
Sorry. Sorry.

744
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:15,750
Supriya, good morning.

745
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,667
-Good morning, auntie.
-What's this?

746
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,583
Actually, auntie,
our fridge isn't working.

747
00:40:19,707 --> 00:40:21,041
Can you keep the milk
in your fridge?

748
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:22,125
Sure.

749
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:18,167
Su!

750
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:24,750
Where are you?

751
00:41:25,292 --> 00:41:27,208
I tried calling you
so many times today.

752
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:29,417
Do you know who came
to the studio today?

753
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:31,958
Aamir Khan!

754
00:41:32,917 --> 00:41:35,542
I wanted you to talk to him
but you didn't answer the phone.

755
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:38,125
Unbelievable.
It was a fabulous chance.

756
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:39,625
You missed it.

757
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,625
At least answer me.

758
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,583
Su.

759
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:46,917
What happened?

760
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:49,042
Su.

761
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:54,625
Su?

762
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:58,208
Su, are you ok?

763
00:41:58,292 --> 00:42:00,500
What happened, Su. Tell me.

764
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:10,542
What happened, Su. Tell me!

765
00:42:12,292 --> 00:42:14,167
Tell me what happened.

766
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:15,417
Tell me.

767
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:22,250
Based on your wife's statement,

768
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,083
we've taken Amit and
Wasim into custody.

769
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:29,208
But, in such a case, a medical report
is necessary, Mr. Bhatnagar.

770
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,667
And it is important to
get it done right away.

771
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,833
Within 24 hours.

772
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:36,333
Because we can keep them in custody

773
00:42:36,417 --> 00:42:37,958
only on the basis
of the medical report. Or...

774
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:40,833
Please prepare her.

775
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:43,208
Her family?

776
00:42:44,792 --> 00:42:46,958
No... I am her only family.

777
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:50,750
I'll...

778
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:57,125
There is no case, sir.

779
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,042
She can't identify them.

780
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:01,708
And the smart asses didn't say
a word during the rape,

781
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:03,458
so she can't even identify their voices.

782
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:06,208
The entire case rests
on her sense of smell.

783
00:43:06,499 --> 00:43:08,624
Will she go around sniffing
everyone in the courtroom?

784
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:10,917
And will the judge accept a
testimony based on smell?

785
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,167
That's why exactly I am sending her
for a medical test.

786
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:19,625
Hello.

787
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:21,458
Yes?

788
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,000
Ok.

789
00:43:30,917 --> 00:43:32,292
The call has come?

790
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:34,250
At such a time,
it's usually what happens.

791
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:36,125
So what? Calls keep coming.

792
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:37,500
Don't worry about my calls.

793
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:39,125
-Do your duty.
-Yes, sir.

794
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:40,875
Take her to Masina hospital
for a medical test.

795
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:42,042
Yes, sir.

796
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,917
Listen, Inspector Chaube
has sent a car for you.

797
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,167
I apologize for the delay.

798
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:13,250
Let's go to the hospital.

799
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:16,750
And, Inspector Chaube
has called you to the police station.

800
00:44:16,917 --> 00:44:18,042
Yes, sir.

801
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:27,458
Open up!

802
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:31,083
You said we were going to the hospital.
Where are we?

803
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:33,833
Open!

804
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:36,792
Is anyone there?

805
00:44:39,792 --> 00:44:41,417
-Who is it?
-Hey!

806
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,375
Stop irritating me with
this constant knocking.

807
00:44:44,458 --> 00:44:46,875
Look, we will keep you here
for 24 hours.

808
00:44:47,208 --> 00:44:48,333
-After that, you can go.
-But, why?

809
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:49,583
Quiet.

810
00:44:49,667 --> 00:44:51,625
If you bang the door again,

811
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:53,375
your wife will be--

812
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:10,125
Rohan!

813
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:16,542
Rohan?

814
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:18,625
Rohan?

815
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:31,250
Rohan.

816
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:33,708
Are you ok?

817
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:37,667
I am fine.

818
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:01,292
Rohan!

819
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:08,958
Supriya!

820
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,583
Rohan!

821
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:19,292
Rohan.

822
00:46:21,042 --> 00:46:21,875
Rohan.

823
00:46:37,042 --> 00:46:40,042
-We've reached the hospital, sir.
-Thank you.

824
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:55,042
Your report is ready.

825
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:56,375
The doctor is asking for you.

826
00:46:57,292 --> 00:46:58,583
Mr. Bhatnagar,

827
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:00,583
don't expect a lot from this report.

828
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:03,792
The 24 hours from the
time of rape are critical,

829
00:47:04,042 --> 00:47:05,125
from an evidence point of view.

830
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:08,500
You came here after 30 hours.
And that too, drenched.

831
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:10,958
All evidence seems to have been
washed away.

832
00:47:14,792 --> 00:47:15,625
What?

833
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:16,708
Kidnapped you?

834
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,375
Locked you up and
threw you in the sea?

835
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,125
Yes.

836
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:22,250
Do you have a witness?

837
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:24,958
Witness?

838
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:27,042
Do you think I am crazy?

839
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:30,750
I've got you figured out.

840
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:32,708
You are extremely cunning.

841
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:35,458
Madam.

842
00:47:36,792 --> 00:47:38,542
Have you really been raped?

843
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:41,125
-Or are you just...?
-What are you saying?

844
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:43,625
You don't seem to understand.

845
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,167
You'll be put away
for a long time.

846
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,416
For trying to frame the legislator.

847
00:47:48,667 --> 00:47:49,749
Defamation and fraud.

848
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:51,542
You will be charged with both.

849
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:54,875
Where is Inspector Chaube?

850
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:57,042
I want to talk to him.

851
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:58,417
Sir is on duty.

852
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:00,083
And what will you speak to him about?

853
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:02,625
Talk to me first.

854
00:48:02,708 --> 00:48:03,542
Look...

855
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,292
'No clinical evidence of rape.'

856
00:48:08,542 --> 00:48:10,042
It is clearly mentioned.

857
00:48:11,292 --> 00:48:13,167
You are frauds.

858
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,875
First, you lodged a complaint for rape
and then, you disappeared for 24 hours.

859
00:48:18,917 --> 00:48:22,000
You thought you would
cook up a story in 24 hours.

860
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:23,667
Am I right?

861
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:26,250
What sort of person are you?

862
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:28,500
You want to make a quick buck
using a woman?

863
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:29,833
-Have some shame.
-You...

864
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,917
If it weren't for your uniform,
I would've broken your jaw.

865
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:37,042
This is rubbish.

866
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,874
I don't believe this report.

867
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:42,042
I will redo the medical test.

868
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:45,542
Come on, Su. Come.

869
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:47,000
I don't want to go anywhere, Rohan.

870
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:48,332
-But, Su.
 -I don't want to go anywhere.

871
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:49,750
-Su...
-Why don't you understand

872
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:51,375
what these people are doing to us?

873
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:53,083
Please.

874
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:55,208
I have been raped.

875
00:48:55,292 --> 00:48:58,292
And ever since then, that's what
 they are doing to you.

876
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:01,500
Please, Rohan, take me home.

877
00:49:01,958 --> 00:49:05,167
I am very tired, Rohan.
Please...

878
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,208
I feel disgusted here.

879
00:49:07,458 --> 00:49:09,042
Please, Rohan.

880
00:49:09,125 --> 00:49:11,333
-Please take me home.
-Ok, Su.

881
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:14,208
Let's go home.

882
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:04,958
Rohan.

883
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:06,417
Dinner is ready.

884
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:08,167
Eat.

885
00:50:10,416 --> 00:50:12,624
I am not hungry, Su.

886
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:14,083
You eat.

887
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:31,375
Rohan, if you don't want to eat,

888
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:32,750
then come to bed.

889
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:35,458
I will sit here for a while, Su.

890
00:50:35,542 --> 00:50:37,958
Su, please... go to sleep.

891
00:50:52,958 --> 00:50:54,042
Rohan,

892
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:56,792
I understand...

893
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:00,999
Now I am not the same person I was.

894
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,708
If you don't want to stay with me,

895
00:51:06,917 --> 00:51:08,458
I have no problem.

896
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:11,792
I have my NGO job.

897
00:51:12,417 --> 00:51:15,792
I will go back there.

898
00:51:18,667 --> 00:51:25,083
I know that things will never be
the same for us again.

899
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:31,082
I will assume that...

900
00:51:33,542 --> 00:51:39,542
everything before yesterday
was a dream.

901
00:51:50,625 --> 00:51:53,000
The food is on the table, Rohan.

902
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:55,833
Eat a little.

903
00:52:15,417 --> 00:52:16,958
Your wife is so gifted

904
00:52:17,042 --> 00:52:18,833
that she can stay without food

905
00:52:18,917 --> 00:52:20,292
she can stay without water...

906
00:52:24,332 --> 00:52:25,374
Sorry.

907
00:52:26,917 --> 00:52:28,792
Rohan, I don't want to force you.

908
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:30,333
But, we have a deadline.

909
00:52:30,542 --> 00:52:34,333
You have dubbed the voice earlier.
So, I don't have a choice.

910
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:38,250
Ready.

911
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:39,458
Great.

912
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:41,958
Let's go again.

913
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:45,250
Your wife is so gifted

914
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:46,917
that she can stay without food

915
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,542
she can stay without water

916
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:50,417
but she can't stay without talking.

917
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:10,542
Su...

918
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:16,792
The time is five o'clock p.m.

919
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,667
I am really sorry for yesterday.

920
00:53:25,083 --> 00:53:28,875
I was silent because
I didn't know what to say.

921
00:53:32,874 --> 00:53:37,791
Yesterday, for the first time,
I felt weak.

922
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:41,458
I was angry with myself.

923
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:46,875
So angry, that I forgot
to wipe your tears.

924
00:53:50,583 --> 00:53:51,750
I am really sorry, Su.

925
00:53:57,083 --> 00:54:01,042
But now, everything will be ok, Su.

926
00:54:03,292 --> 00:54:06,500
We will go back to how
we were before.

927
00:54:08,417 --> 00:54:09,333
You and...

928
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,625
Su... Su...

929
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,417
Su... Su...

930
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:27,167
What have you done?

931
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:29,000
Speak to me, Su.

932
00:54:29,083 --> 00:54:30,458
Tell me...

933
00:54:30,542 --> 00:54:33,333
Say something, Su.

934
00:54:33,458 --> 00:54:36,208
Su!
You can't do this, Su!

935
00:54:36,791 --> 00:54:39,041
No... no!

936
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:43,000
No, Supriya, no!

937
00:54:43,542 --> 00:54:46,167
You can't give up, Supriya.

938
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:48,417
No!

939
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:11,458
"I am with you, burning in this fire"

940
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:23,708
"All my dreams, burnt away"

941
00:55:24,042 --> 00:55:29,958
"Those moments I spent with you"

942
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:36,042
"My beloved engulfed in flames"

943
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:43,208
"The ashes of our yearning rise"

944
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:49,208
"To ask me"

945
00:55:51,167 --> 00:55:53,125
"Am I"

946
00:55:53,958 --> 00:55:58,583
"Worthy of your love?"

947
00:56:00,249 --> 00:56:06,916
"Or am I not?"

948
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:15,583
"Am I worthy of your love?"

949
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:23,208
"Or am I not?"

950
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:30,583
Listen,

951
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:32,583
I'll go to the garage for a bit.

952
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,583
I've left some rice in the fridge. Eat it.

953
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:38,917
Let's go.

954
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:16,083
Your wife was pretty.

955
00:57:22,542 --> 00:57:24,500
I am legislator Madhavrao Shellar.

956
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:27,708
Amit's older brother.

957
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:33,333
I don't know why I feel that...

958
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:37,083
you won't vote for me
these elections.

959
00:57:40,042 --> 00:57:44,417
Youth is like a racehorse.

960
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:48,750
It sprints at the sound of a gunshot.

961
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:53,208
They have more spirit than
blood running through their veins.

962
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:57,167
I was once young like Amit.

963
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:04,292
I too, fell for Mhatre's wife...
from the colony.

964
00:58:05,792 --> 00:58:07,583
But, I couldn't do anything about it.

965
00:58:08,917 --> 00:58:10,250
I didn't have the support.

966
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:15,250
My father was a poor mill worker.

967
00:58:16,042 --> 00:58:19,708
But, Amit does have support.

968
00:58:20,917 --> 00:58:21,999
Mine.

969
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,166
Which means, what I couldn't do,
Amit can.

970
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:32,500
I own the cops.

971
00:58:33,667 --> 00:58:35,042
I got Amit released.

972
00:58:38,042 --> 00:58:41,875
Mr. Bhatnagar, I feel sorry, too.

973
00:58:42,875 --> 00:58:44,667
You were newly-weds.

974
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
It was still the honeymoon
and she left the world.

975
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:52,917
But...

976
00:58:53,708 --> 00:58:56,042
you were the first to be with her.

977
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:58,583
Amit got nothing special.

978
00:59:04,292 --> 00:59:06,042
Don't talk to the media.

979
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,792
Don't talk to the people in the colony.

980
00:59:10,542 --> 00:59:12,083
The more you talk,

981
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:14,083
the more it'll give rise
to defamation.

982
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:15,208
For Amit.

983
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:17,625
I have to send him to Delhi.

984
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:21,125
People in the colony
will forget in a few days.

985
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:22,667
You should forget, too.

986
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:26,667
Delete it from your memory.

987
00:59:28,832 --> 00:59:30,124
All right.

988
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,958
Mr. Bhatnagar,

989
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,875
I didn't get one thing about your wife.

990
00:59:40,333 --> 00:59:44,416
If she wanted to commit suicide,

991
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,833
why didn't she do it after
she was raped the first time?

992
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:50,417
Why wait till the second time?

993
00:59:53,083 --> 00:59:54,458
Bye.

994
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:12,917
"Rohan,

995
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:16,083
I know that neither you
nor your love is weak.

996
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:19,082
We would've been fine in a few days

997
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,833
and would return to our normal lives.

998
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:26,417
But if what happened today,
continued to happen,

999
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:29,000
you would have broken.

1000
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:30,624
And I wouldn't be able to bear it.

1001
01:01:32,042 --> 01:01:33,707
Today, when you went to work,

1002
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:36,666
I was cooking in the kitchen."

1003
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:05,542
Who is it?

1004
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:07,292
Percy.

1005
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:10,875
Sister, I found the ball.

1006
01:02:11,042 --> 01:02:12,667
Good, and don't worry about the glass.

1007
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:14,250
I will clean it.

1008
01:02:14,333 --> 01:02:15,833
Sister, have you made flatbreads?

1009
01:02:15,917 --> 01:02:17,333
Yes. Stuffed with potato.

1010
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,792
Will you eat some?

1011
01:02:21,749 --> 01:02:23,082
Tomorrow, flatbreads stuffed
with cauliflower?

1012
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,500
All right. Done!

1013
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:25,917
Thank you, sister.

1014
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,750
-Ok. Bye.
-Bye.

1015
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,458
Even we will eat flatbreads.

1016
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:38,667
That day you...

1017
01:02:38,792 --> 01:02:40,667
you didn't hear my voice.

1018
01:02:41,542 --> 01:02:42,583
That's fine.

1019
01:02:42,917 --> 01:02:44,083
Hear it today.

1020
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:46,667
And get used to hearing it.

1021
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:49,750
Because from now on,
we will keep visiting.

1022
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:52,666
I will come whenever I feel like.

1023
01:02:56,125 --> 01:02:58,875
Let's try something new today.

1024
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:06,333
"I know how much pain you are in.

1025
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:09,125
And I love you so much.

1026
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:12,792
I couldn't let you go through
this agony repeatedly,

1027
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:16,125
I have to go.

1028
01:03:25,708 --> 01:03:30,333
I regret that
I am leaving you alone.

1029
01:03:43,542 --> 01:03:45,625
I have one last wish, though.

1030
01:03:46,292 --> 01:03:48,167
I am leaving these two watches behind.

1031
01:03:49,042 --> 01:03:50,750
If it's possible, cremate one...

1032
01:03:51,917 --> 01:03:53,917
and bury the other.

1033
01:03:54,542 --> 01:03:56,458
Yours, Su."

1034
01:04:09,875 --> 01:04:10,749
Rohan,

1035
01:04:14,792 --> 01:04:16,041
these are the ashes.

1036
01:04:29,042 --> 01:04:30,125
These are not ashes.

1037
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:33,250
It is my Su.

1038
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:37,542
You will have to bid
sister-in-law goodbye.

1039
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:40,625
Come, let's scatter them in water.

1040
01:04:41,542 --> 01:04:42,750
No, Zafar.

1041
01:04:45,458 --> 01:04:47,041
I have bid her goodbye with fire.

1042
01:04:50,457 --> 01:04:51,957
Water will have to wait.

1043
01:05:02,125 --> 01:05:03,333
Here.

1044
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:05,958
What is it?

1045
01:05:07,542 --> 01:05:10,500
Have you come to mourn your wife
at the police station?

1046
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:12,708
I want to meet Inspector Chaube.

1047
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:15,333
Sir is on duty.

1048
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:17,708
You have his mobile number.

1049
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,167
Give it to me.

1050
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,333
What do you think?

1051
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:22,083
That everybody is sitting
idle for you?

1052
01:05:22,167 --> 01:05:24,000
Do you know what a large area
falls under him?

1053
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:25,625
There are so many cases.

1054
01:05:26,292 --> 01:05:27,333
You don't even have a case.

1055
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:28,542
You are a fraud.

1056
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:32,250
Don't come back here.

1057
01:05:32,667 --> 01:05:34,207
I won't.

1058
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:37,417
But, I won't leave without meeting
Inspector Chaube today.

1059
01:05:37,499 --> 01:05:38,874
Will you hold a demonstration here?

1060
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:41,625
Can't you understand?
Sir is out on duty.

1061
01:05:41,708 --> 01:05:42,583
"Inspector Chaube... Inspector..."

1062
01:05:42,667 --> 01:05:44,333
Inspector Chaube,
I want to talk to you.

1063
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:46,582
Hey!

1064
01:05:46,667 --> 01:05:47,500
Inspector Chaube.

1065
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,208
Get out... out!

1066
01:05:49,792 --> 01:05:51,208
I told you to get out.

1067
01:05:51,292 --> 01:05:52,250
We've given you enough respect.

1068
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:53,375
Now, get out.

1069
01:05:53,458 --> 01:05:55,125
-Nalawde.
-Sir.

1070
01:05:55,707 --> 01:05:56,582
Yes, sir.

1071
01:05:59,667 --> 01:06:00,875
Tell me.

1072
01:06:03,833 --> 01:06:05,792
Everything happened very fast, sir.

1073
01:06:07,917 --> 01:06:09,583
My Su's departure,

1074
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:13,458
the closing of this case
and their release.

1075
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:14,583
Mr. Bhatnagar,

1076
01:06:14,667 --> 01:06:18,000
we had to release them because
we didn't have evidence against them.

1077
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,125
And your wife committed suicide.

1078
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:27,208
We can't see him but he exists.

1079
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:31,958
Behind every suicide the killer exists.

1080
01:06:34,542 --> 01:06:36,167
My Su was not weak.

1081
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,167
And even she understood that

1082
01:06:41,792 --> 01:06:45,792
there is more darkness in your law
than in our world.

1083
01:06:48,124 --> 01:06:50,124
She would've lived
with this truth,

1084
01:06:52,166 --> 01:06:53,749
but after the second time,

1085
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:57,667
she broke.

1086
01:07:00,957 --> 01:07:02,416
Second time?
What do you mean?

1087
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,875
They came back, sir.

1088
01:07:05,667 --> 01:07:06,917
They raped my Su, again.

1089
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,125
What?

1090
01:07:08,208 --> 01:07:09,583
He's talking nonsense, sir.

1091
01:07:09,667 --> 01:07:11,750
Don't worry, Inspector Nalawde.

1092
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:15,333
I won't make the mistake
of filing a complaint again.

1093
01:07:16,292 --> 01:07:17,792
And anyway,

1094
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:22,083
neither I, nor Su have
any hope for you now.

1095
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:25,458
I only came to tell you that

1096
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:29,542
if your system had helped me a little,

1097
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:32,167
I wouldn't have to do anything.

1098
01:07:34,333 --> 01:07:35,667
Now, I will have to.

1099
01:07:37,042 --> 01:07:38,083
For my Su.

1100
01:07:38,292 --> 01:07:40,208
What do you mean, you will have to?
What will you do?

1101
01:07:41,167 --> 01:07:42,083
Will you take revenge?

1102
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:43,458
A reply, sir.

1103
01:07:45,042 --> 01:07:46,250
I will respond to them.

1104
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:51,249
And you won't need an FIR
or a medical check-up.

1105
01:07:52,708 --> 01:07:57,208
You may only need a post-mortem.

1106
01:07:57,542 --> 01:07:58,708
And you will go scot-free?

1107
01:07:58,792 --> 01:07:59,792
Yes, sir.

1108
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:02,167
Like they did.

1109
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:04,833
Perfect crime.

1110
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:07,542
And what do you think?

1111
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:09,042
That our eyes will remain shut?

1112
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:10,792
No, sir.

1113
01:08:11,667 --> 01:08:13,625
Your eyes will be open,

1114
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:16,417
but you won't be able to
see anything.

1115
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,958
Your ears will be open but
you won't be able to hear anything.

1116
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:28,375
You will want to say something
but you will not be able to speak.

1117
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:31,500
And most importantly,

1118
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:34,500
you will figure it all out,

1119
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,375
but you won't be able to
explain it to anyone.

1120
01:08:39,667 --> 01:08:42,083
Are you playing a game with us?

1121
01:08:42,292 --> 01:08:44,083
Giving us four options,
A, B, C, D.

1122
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:46,000
They started the game.

1123
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:49,333
You enjoyed it.

1124
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,458
I will end it.

1125
01:08:54,958 --> 01:08:56,542
-One more thing.
-Say it.

1126
01:08:56,625 --> 01:08:58,125
Say everything today.

1127
01:08:59,958 --> 01:09:02,250
There won't be
any lifeline in this game, sir.

1128
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,083
I'll take your leave.

1129
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:50,083
Amit...

1130
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:51,625
-Yes?
-Where to?

1131
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:54,042
There's no fixed plan yet.

1132
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:55,792
I will call Wasim.

1133
01:09:55,875 --> 01:09:57,625
Do you know
why Nalawde is here?

1134
01:09:58,583 --> 01:10:00,458
We've already paid him four lakhs
 to cover things up.

1135
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:02,208
Plus, the news has reached
the party headquarters.

1136
01:10:02,292 --> 01:10:03,542
And, you don't care.

1137
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:05,792
You mess around and
your brother has to pay for it.

1138
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:07,000
Enough.

1139
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:10,208
No more hanging out with Wasim.

1140
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:13,167
Concentrate on the campaign.

1141
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:15,208
There are only two months
for the elections to begin.

1142
01:10:15,375 --> 01:10:17,417
If I hear about one more stupid thing,

1143
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,292
I will send you
to our sister in Pune.

1144
01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:20,750
Do you understand?

1145
01:10:20,958 --> 01:10:23,292
Yes, I understand.

1146
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:24,917
I am going.

1147
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:27,625
Will he listen to you?

1148
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:32,125
What can I tell you, Nalawde?

1149
01:10:32,667 --> 01:10:34,750
We have the same blood
running in our veins.

1150
01:10:36,542 --> 01:10:38,292
He won't listen.
He won't understand.

1151
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:42,750
He will go over to Wasim's and party.

1152
01:10:55,958 --> 01:10:59,417
"Some desire me"

1153
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,958
"Some are intoxicated with me"

1154
01:11:03,042 --> 01:11:06,458
"I am wild youth"

1155
01:11:06,542 --> 01:11:10,000
"My lovers are all over"

1156
01:11:10,083 --> 01:11:13,542
"Some yearn for me"

1157
01:11:13,625 --> 01:11:17,042
"To some, I am a lover"

1158
01:11:17,125 --> 01:11:22,125
"Many a prayer are said
To make me theirs"

1159
01:11:27,708 --> 01:11:30,833
"The whole world"

1160
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:34,375
"Revolves around a beautiful woman"

1161
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:38,250
"Why does the world then say"

1162
01:11:38,417 --> 01:11:41,542
"It's wrong to fall in love?"

1163
01:11:41,833 --> 01:11:44,958
"The whole world"

1164
01:11:45,417 --> 01:11:48,708
"Revolves around a beautiful woman"

1165
01:11:48,917 --> 01:11:52,292
"Why does the world then say"

1166
01:11:52,458 --> 01:11:55,667
"It's wrong to fall in love?"

1167
01:11:55,917 --> 01:11:59,042
"The whole world"

1168
01:12:12,917 --> 01:12:14,625
"This girl is the one"

1169
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:16,375
"She's dynamite"

1170
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:19,583
"She causes fights daily in every alley"

1171
01:12:20,083 --> 01:12:21,667
"Give me a little time"

1172
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:23,417
"Love isn't a crime"

1173
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,208
"I find her better every passing day"

1174
01:12:25,292 --> 01:12:26,708
"Are you a girl or wine?"

1175
01:12:26,792 --> 01:12:30,375
"People want to know
When will you fall in love?"

1176
01:12:30,542 --> 01:12:34,042
"The world is queuing up and so am I"

1177
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:35,583
"The whole world"

1178
01:12:35,667 --> 01:12:37,500
"Revolves around a beautiful woman"

1179
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:39,083
"The whole world"

1180
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,917
"Revolves around a beautiful woman"

1181
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,458
"The whole world"

1182
01:12:42,542 --> 01:12:44,750
"Revolves around a beautiful woman"

1183
01:12:45,417 --> 01:12:49,208
"The whole world"

1184
01:12:54,792 --> 01:12:58,333
"Who says"

1185
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:01,750
"To fall in love today"

1186
01:13:01,875 --> 01:13:08,583
"Trust the kind that never ends"

1187
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:12,417
"Who says"

1188
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:15,875
"To fall in love today"

1189
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:22,292
"Trust the kind that never ends"

1190
01:13:22,417 --> 01:13:25,833
"Some desire me"

1191
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,416
"Some are intoxicated with me"

1192
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:33,000
"I am wild youth"

1193
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:36,458
"Lovers are all over"

1194
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:40,042
"Some yearn for me"

1195
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:43,542
"To some, I am a lover"

1196
01:13:43,625 --> 01:13:48,667
"Many a prayer are said
To make me theirs"

1197
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:57,625
"The whole world"

1198
01:13:57,708 --> 01:14:01,125
"Revolves around a beautiful woman"

1199
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:04,750
"Why does the world then say"

1200
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:08,167
"It's wrong to fall in love?"

1201
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:11,833
"The whole world"

1202
01:15:30,875 --> 01:15:33,583
"The whole world..."

1203
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:36,874
Today was great fun.

1204
01:15:37,042 --> 01:15:42,375
"The whole world revolves
around a beautiful woman."

1205
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:48,250
"Then, why does the world say,
it's wrong to fall in love?"

1206
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:50,208
Look, Wasim.

1207
01:15:50,333 --> 01:15:52,375
So what if the dance bar has closed?

1208
01:15:52,458 --> 01:15:55,125
Our bar is open 24 hours.

1209
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:56,833
Let's have a couple.

1210
01:15:56,917 --> 01:15:59,125
-Come.
-How much will you drink?

1211
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:01,083
-How much?
-I will drink.

1212
01:16:01,167 --> 01:16:03,083
We will have to stop meeting anyway.

1213
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:04,042
Why?

1214
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:05,458
Father is very angry.

1215
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,042
Yes.

1216
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:09,375
Even brother is very angry with me.

1217
01:16:09,542 --> 01:16:13,542
He says, "You mess around
and your brother has to pay for it."

1218
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:15,417
"No more meeting Wasim."

1219
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:16,708
"Concentrate on the campaign."

1220
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:20,833
Bloody...

1221
01:16:20,917 --> 01:16:22,625
if I concentrate on the campaign,

1222
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:23,958
who will concentrate on alcohol?

1223
01:16:24,042 --> 01:16:26,500
-Isn't that right?
-Let's go.

1224
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:28,083
We've had enough.

1225
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,792
Go? Ok.

1226
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:33,542
So, we'll leave now.

1227
01:16:33,625 --> 01:16:35,542
Come on, Wasim.

1228
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:40,417
Be careful. You drink so much.

1229
01:16:41,917 --> 01:16:46,917
"The whole world revolves
around a beautiful woman."

1230
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:52,042
Brothers and sisters, it's not pride,

1231
01:16:52,958 --> 01:16:57,208
but everyone knows what
our party has done for the locality.

1232
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:00,875
Putting an end to injustice.

1233
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:04,750
And progress for everyone.

1234
01:17:05,917 --> 01:17:10,708
This is our party's mantra
and this is its goal.

1235
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:12,250
Victory to Maharashtra!

1236
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:18,125
"Putting an end to injustice."

1237
01:17:18,292 --> 01:17:20,750
"And progress for everyone."

1238
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:22,167
"This is our..."

1239
01:17:23,417 --> 01:17:25,458
"So what if the dance bar has closed?"

1240
01:17:25,542 --> 01:17:28,250
"Our bar is open 24 hours."

1241
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,542
"Let's have a couple."

1242
01:17:31,792 --> 01:17:33,708
"Let's have a couple."

1243
01:17:35,583 --> 01:17:36,417
"What do you think?"

1244
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,167
"That everybody is sitting around
idle for you?"

1245
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:40,083
"Do you know what a large area
falls under him?"

1246
01:17:40,208 --> 01:17:41,625
"There are so many cases."

1247
01:17:42,333 --> 01:17:43,375
"You don't even have a case."

1248
01:17:43,542 --> 01:17:44,583
"You are a fraud."

1249
01:17:45,167 --> 01:17:46,667
"Don't come back."

1250
01:17:48,542 --> 01:17:49,833
Rohan.

1251
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:56,958
Why are you listening to
the voices of people that I hate?

1252
01:18:02,542 --> 01:18:05,542
These voices have
silenced our love, Su.

1253
01:18:10,167 --> 01:18:11,583
But, very soon...

1254
01:18:13,416 --> 01:18:17,291
no one will ever hear
these voices again.

1255
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,333
Hello.

1256
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,375
Figure out a solution
for Wasim quickly, Nalawde.

1257
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:39,375
He is always stuck like
a magnet to Amit.

1258
01:18:39,583 --> 01:18:40,750
Tell me, sir.

1259
01:18:40,833 --> 01:18:41,792
What is the order?

1260
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:46,250
You guys detain people temporarily
during festivals.

1261
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:47,333
-Yes... yes.
-What is it called?

1262
01:18:47,625 --> 01:18:48,708
Preventive arrest.

1263
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:51,125
What an idea, sir.

1264
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,750
I'll pick him up today.

1265
01:18:54,792 --> 01:18:57,583
Sir, I am... a little short.

1266
01:18:57,667 --> 01:18:59,625
Don't worry.

1267
01:18:59,792 --> 01:19:01,167
I am right here.

1268
01:19:01,708 --> 01:19:02,917
Meet me later.

1269
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,708
-Ok.
-Yes. I'll come. Victory to Maharashtra!

1270
01:19:04,792 --> 01:19:06,000
Victory to Maharashtra!

1271
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:16,125
Hello, sir.

1272
01:19:19,417 --> 01:19:20,499
What have I done?

1273
01:19:20,625 --> 01:19:21,833
You haven't done anything.

1274
01:19:21,917 --> 01:19:23,625
Neither will you.

1275
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:26,000
-What?
-Rest inside for three days.

1276
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:27,208
I will release you after that.

1277
01:19:27,667 --> 01:19:29,000
Take him.

1278
01:19:29,083 --> 01:19:30,667
Sir, please listen to me.

1279
01:19:30,958 --> 01:19:32,167
Come.

1280
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,958
What disgusting behavior
is this, Amit?

1281
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:35,458
What happened?

1282
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:36,750
Who is it?

1283
01:19:37,583 --> 01:19:38,583
Hear me out.

1284
01:19:39,042 --> 01:19:41,333
My love, don't think so much.

1285
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:43,375
No one will even know.

1286
01:19:44,208 --> 01:19:45,792
I am not calling you for free.

1287
01:19:46,042 --> 01:19:47,125
I will pay you.

1288
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:50,208
Tell me, should I book a room?

1289
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:54,375
Come, we will have some fun.

1290
01:19:54,667 --> 01:19:56,500
You are so dead.

1291
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:58,708
You are dead!

1292
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,375
So what if you are my son's friend?

1293
01:20:02,875 --> 01:20:04,458
You are dead now!

1294
01:20:09,958 --> 01:20:11,875
By tomorrow, this note
should reach every home.

1295
01:20:11,958 --> 01:20:13,332
-Sure.
-Each and every home.

1296
01:20:13,792 --> 01:20:15,417
Everyone should be
talking about brother.

1297
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,417
Got it?

1298
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17,417
Come.

1299
01:20:22,042 --> 01:20:23,167
Shakeel uncle?

1300
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:24,499
But, why did you slap me?

1301
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:26,625
-What have I done?
-What have you done?

1302
01:20:26,833 --> 01:20:29,250
You are asking me what you have done?

1303
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:32,708
-I will stick your phone into you.
-What?

1304
01:20:32,792 --> 01:20:35,625
For the rest of your life,
you will neither be able to walk nor sit.

1305
01:20:35,708 --> 01:20:38,208
-If you call again.
-But, call who?

1306
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:40,167
Stay away from my daughter.

1307
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:44,125
The old man has lost it.

1308
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:51,042
-Hello.
-I made a mistake.

1309
01:20:51,292 --> 01:20:52,333
I thought I was talking to Payal.

1310
01:20:52,417 --> 01:20:53,457
Think about it.

1311
01:20:53,542 --> 01:20:56,166
Have I ever spoken to you
this way in so many years?

1312
01:20:56,708 --> 01:20:57,667
No.

1313
01:20:58,083 --> 01:20:59,083
Meet me once.

1314
01:20:59,167 --> 01:21:01,292
We will meet face to face and
clear this misunderstanding.

1315
01:21:01,375 --> 01:21:02,417
I don't want to meet.

1316
01:21:02,583 --> 01:21:06,292
Look, Lubna.
We are childhood friends.

1317
01:21:07,042 --> 01:21:08,667
Don't sever our friendship like that.

1318
01:21:08,792 --> 01:21:11,000
I want to meet you once
and apologize. That's it.

1319
01:21:11,167 --> 01:21:12,375
Meet me once.

1320
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:13,375
Please, come.

1321
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:14,292
All right.

1322
01:21:14,374 --> 01:21:15,291
Where do you want to meet?

1323
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:16,958
Sorry for what?

1324
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:19,333
Why did you lie to Shakeel uncle?

1325
01:21:19,417 --> 01:21:20,792
When did I call you?

1326
01:21:20,958 --> 01:21:23,000
You unnecessarily
got me slapped in public.

1327
01:21:23,167 --> 01:21:25,667
He was a college friend.

1328
01:21:26,583 --> 01:21:28,083
What if father found out?

1329
01:21:29,792 --> 01:21:33,000
Can't you take a slap for me?

1330
01:21:33,791 --> 01:21:35,166
I am sorry.

1331
01:21:35,792 --> 01:21:38,583
If you don't believe me,
I will apologize in person.

1332
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Shall we meet?

1333
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:48,375
Mind your tongue, Shellar.

1334
01:21:48,667 --> 01:21:50,083
She is my daughter.

1335
01:21:51,125 --> 01:21:52,792
And don't forget that
we are butchers.

1336
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:54,667
Hey... chicken thief!

1337
01:21:55,583 --> 01:21:57,207
There is no need to scream.

1338
01:21:57,958 --> 01:21:59,583
There is no need to scream!

1339
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:05,625
Look, your son enjoys
his drinks with Amit's money.

1340
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:09,667
Now, even your daughter has
started enticing him.

1341
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:10,750
Shellar!

1342
01:22:10,833 --> 01:22:13,250
Be quiet.

1343
01:22:14,542 --> 01:22:15,582
Don't scream.

1344
01:22:17,042 --> 01:22:18,708
Go.

1345
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:21,583
Go behind the mosque.

1346
01:22:21,875 --> 01:22:22,708
And see it with your own eyes.

1347
01:22:22,792 --> 01:22:24,249
You will understand.

1348
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:27,333
You will know who called whom.

1349
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:29,958
Go right now.

1350
01:22:32,875 --> 01:22:34,250
Lubna...

1351
01:22:34,792 --> 01:22:36,042
apologize now!

1352
01:22:36,208 --> 01:22:38,917
You seemed to be in
quite a mood on the phone.

1353
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:40,625
What are you looking at?
Apologize.

1354
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:42,958
Shut up! Enough.

1355
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:44,542
-What?
-Are you mad?

1356
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:45,750
You aren't going to change.

1357
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:46,792
What are you saying?

1358
01:22:46,875 --> 01:22:48,167
On the phone you said that
you wanted to apologize.

1359
01:22:48,333 --> 01:22:50,042
And now, you are back
to your ways.

1360
01:22:50,292 --> 01:22:52,042
Why would I say sorry?

1361
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:54,583
I think the entire butcher family
has lost it.

1362
01:22:54,667 --> 01:22:57,000
-No.
-Father?

1363
01:22:57,083 --> 01:22:59,500
It's not our family,
but yours that has gone mad.

1364
01:22:59,583 --> 01:23:01,375
And the biggest lunatic
is your brother.

1365
01:23:01,458 --> 01:23:03,500
-Hey!
-You get out of here.

1366
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:05,125
I will deal with you later.

1367
01:23:05,208 --> 01:23:06,458
First let me cool him off.

1368
01:23:06,542 --> 01:23:08,042
Put the knife away.

1369
01:23:08,958 --> 01:23:10,042
Shakeel...

1370
01:23:12,875 --> 01:23:14,500
That day you slapped me,
I didn't say anything.

1371
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:16,042
You play with my daughter...

1372
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:18,542
Put the knife away, Shakeel.

1373
01:23:18,667 --> 01:23:20,458
Put the knife away.

1374
01:23:27,917 --> 01:23:28,792
Father!

1375
01:24:03,375 --> 01:24:04,958
How dare you file the complaint.

1376
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:08,958
Is he dead?

1377
01:24:10,375 --> 01:24:12,833
Mr. Shellar, there's
Inspector Chaube above me.

1378
01:24:12,917 --> 01:24:14,667
What do you mean?

1379
01:24:15,292 --> 01:24:18,208
Your hand is first to reach
the wad of notes.

1380
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:19,708
Am I wrong?

1381
01:24:20,917 --> 01:24:22,375
Then do the work.

1382
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:24,708
Tear up the complaint.

1383
01:24:25,917 --> 01:24:29,542
I'll figure out what the problem between
Amit and the butcher's family is.

1384
01:24:29,625 --> 01:24:32,125
Send Wasim to me.

1385
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:34,792
So, should I release him?

1386
01:24:35,667 --> 01:24:36,541
Who?

1387
01:24:37,583 --> 01:24:40,042
Mr. Shellar, on your order
I put Wasim in jail for three days.

1388
01:24:40,167 --> 01:24:41,750
Are you drunk?

1389
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:44,625
When did I tell you
to put Wasim in jail?

1390
01:24:45,167 --> 01:24:46,667
Do I own your jail?

1391
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:48,417
Do I?

1392
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:50,082
No, sir.

1393
01:24:50,417 --> 01:24:51,542
Remember, Nalawde.

1394
01:24:52,667 --> 01:24:54,792
Even a dog is loyal to the one
that feeds him the bone.

1395
01:24:54,875 --> 01:24:56,833
Don't try to bite that hand.

1396
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,917
Clear? Do you get it?

1397
01:25:01,375 --> 01:25:02,208
Yes, sir.

1398
01:25:02,708 --> 01:25:03,833
Leave.

1399
01:25:04,042 --> 01:25:05,167
Send Wasim here.

1400
01:25:06,375 --> 01:25:07,500
Go. Out!

1401
01:25:14,833 --> 01:25:16,083
Rohan, enough.

1402
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:17,958
How many shoes are
you going to make me try?

1403
01:25:18,042 --> 01:25:19,458
This one has the right tone.

1404
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:22,667
When you wear this,
I will know how close you are.

1405
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:24,375
Or how far!

1406
01:25:42,042 --> 01:25:43,000
Hi.

1407
01:25:46,792 --> 01:25:48,292
You're awake?

1408
01:25:48,583 --> 01:25:50,250
I haven't slept.

1409
01:25:50,417 --> 01:25:51,542
What?

1410
01:25:51,958 --> 01:25:54,250
Then what were you doing?

1411
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:57,542
I was waiting for you to wake up.

1412
01:26:01,417 --> 01:26:03,375
Good morning, Mrs. Bhatnagar.

1413
01:26:05,542 --> 01:26:06,625
Good morning.

1414
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:08,750
Good morning, Mr. Bhatnagar.

1415
01:26:08,917 --> 01:26:13,250
"Since a few days"

1416
01:26:13,333 --> 01:26:17,917
"I've become accustomed to you"

1417
01:26:22,333 --> 01:26:26,542
"Since a few days"

1418
01:26:27,042 --> 01:26:31,000
"I've become accustomed to you"

1419
01:26:31,625 --> 01:26:35,833
"Since a few days"

1420
01:26:35,917 --> 01:26:40,333
"You've become my necessity"

1421
01:26:40,625 --> 01:26:44,958
"I smile through your lips"

1422
01:26:45,417 --> 01:26:49,125
"I flow in your rhythm"

1423
01:26:49,458 --> 01:26:54,000
"I cannot live without you"

1424
01:26:54,333 --> 01:27:00,042
"I promise"

1425
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:37,000
"I soar in your breeze these days"

1426
01:27:37,083 --> 01:27:39,208
"These days"

1427
01:27:39,542 --> 01:27:43,125
"I only walk"

1428
01:27:43,208 --> 01:27:48,333
"With you these days"

1429
01:27:48,542 --> 01:27:52,833
"There is nothing remaining of me"

1430
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,375
"Everything is yours"

1431
01:27:57,458 --> 01:28:01,667
"Since a few days"

1432
01:28:02,167 --> 01:28:06,333
"I've become accustomed to you"

1433
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:10,458
"Since a few days"

1434
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:15,250
"You have become my necessity"

1435
01:28:36,042 --> 01:28:38,792
I didn't get a chance to get
used to them, Rohan.

1436
01:28:40,583 --> 01:28:42,333
They won't get time either, Su.

1437
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:25,000
Don't bother.

1438
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:26,542
Sit.

1439
01:29:29,292 --> 01:29:30,625
What's going on, Wasim?

1440
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:34,042
What's going on between
Amit and your father?

1441
01:29:35,292 --> 01:29:39,583
Brother, Amit misbehaved with Lubna.

1442
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:41,792
Have you lost it?

1443
01:29:43,042 --> 01:29:45,167
Amit considers your sister his own sister.

1444
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:46,708
Do you think he could do this?

1445
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,583
And your father brought
a knife to kill Amit.

1446
01:29:50,667 --> 01:29:52,292
Chaube has filed a complaint.

1447
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:54,708
Now, what I am saying is...

1448
01:29:55,083 --> 01:29:56,750
I have sent Amit to Pune.

1449
01:29:56,833 --> 01:30:00,708
Tell your father to
rescind the complaint.

1450
01:30:02,708 --> 01:30:03,917
Do you remember,

1451
01:30:05,125 --> 01:30:08,042
I got you out in the
blind girl's rape case?

1452
01:30:09,042 --> 01:30:10,500
Do you remember or not?

1453
01:30:11,625 --> 01:30:14,292
I will bear your father's
medical expenses.

1454
01:30:15,792 --> 01:30:17,291
You rescind the complaint.

1455
01:30:17,375 --> 01:30:18,917
Do you understand?

1456
01:30:19,374 --> 01:30:20,374
Yes.

1457
01:30:20,667 --> 01:30:21,667
Go.

1458
01:30:27,083 --> 01:30:29,750
-Hello.
-Wasim, this is Amit.

1459
01:30:32,458 --> 01:30:34,000
You are calling from Mumbai, right?

1460
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:35,625
The number is from here.

1461
01:30:35,833 --> 01:30:37,458
And your brother says that
you've gone to Pune.

1462
01:30:38,125 --> 01:30:39,625
Are both brothers
making a fool of me?

1463
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:42,500
Wasim, I never called Lubna.

1464
01:30:42,708 --> 01:30:44,250
At least meet me.

1465
01:30:44,333 --> 01:30:46,833
I want to meet you and
clear everything.

1466
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:50,625
Where will you meet me?

1467
01:30:55,208 --> 01:30:56,166
Amit?

1468
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:59,250
Come, Wasim.

1469
01:31:00,042 --> 01:31:03,042
Look. I've got you
the best whiskey today.

1470
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:05,125
Scotch.

1471
01:31:06,167 --> 01:31:09,167
I have to make
peace with my bro,

1472
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:11,125
so I thought the whiskey
should do the trick.

1473
01:31:11,292 --> 01:31:12,333
Isn't it?

1474
01:31:12,708 --> 01:31:14,292
You stabbed my father.

1475
01:31:14,792 --> 01:31:15,958
Misbehaved with Lubna.

1476
01:31:16,042 --> 01:31:18,208
Do you think
I'll have a drink with you?

1477
01:31:18,292 --> 01:31:20,542
Forget the bad behavior.

1478
01:31:21,167 --> 01:31:24,000
What respect did you show
the blind girl?

1479
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:25,083
Hey.

1480
01:31:25,167 --> 01:31:27,042
Lubna is my sister. Get it?

1481
01:31:27,125 --> 01:31:29,333
And we both had fun
with the blind girl.

1482
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:30,958
And that too, twice.

1483
01:31:31,708 --> 01:31:33,750
And what's with this
new concern for the blind girl?

1484
01:31:33,833 --> 01:31:35,125
Who is she to you?

1485
01:31:35,792 --> 01:31:36,792
Everything.

1486
01:31:48,208 --> 01:31:50,958
She was everything.

1487
01:31:51,167 --> 01:31:52,667
How did you manage
to sound like Amit?

1488
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:55,667
It was you on the phone,
wasn't it?

1489
01:31:57,375 --> 01:31:58,542
I am blind

1490
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:01,000
but I can hear.

1491
01:32:02,208 --> 01:32:03,833
And I can make you hear
what I want.

1492
01:33:18,167 --> 01:33:19,125
Enough.

1493
01:33:19,208 --> 01:33:20,917
The lights are on now,
and you are off!

1494
01:35:01,874 --> 01:35:05,999
"We can't see him but he exists."

1495
01:35:06,958 --> 01:35:10,000
"Behind every suicide the killer exists."

1496
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:12,833
Sir, has the blind guy
started playing his game?

1497
01:35:13,125 --> 01:35:14,417
Are you crazy, Nalawde?

1498
01:35:15,333 --> 01:35:16,333
Look at the preparation.

1499
01:35:16,792 --> 01:35:17,958
And he cannot see.

1500
01:35:18,375 --> 01:35:19,750
He is incapable of this.

1501
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:21,417
What is that on his shoulder?

1502
01:35:24,708 --> 01:35:25,833
Sir, a handkerchief.

1503
01:35:31,458 --> 01:35:32,458
A. S.

1504
01:35:37,167 --> 01:35:38,542
Amit Shellar.

1505
01:35:40,083 --> 01:35:43,792
Nalawde, animosity runs
just as deep as friendship.

1506
01:35:45,458 --> 01:35:47,208
Find out where Amit Shellar is.

1507
01:35:48,250 --> 01:35:49,250
Yes, sir.

1508
01:35:49,375 --> 01:35:50,625
This is not a suicide,

1509
01:35:52,125 --> 01:35:53,375
but a murder.

1510
01:36:09,583 --> 01:36:11,375
How are you, Chaube?

1511
01:36:15,250 --> 01:36:17,042
Amit was in Pune yesterday.

1512
01:36:17,542 --> 01:36:20,500
Do you have proof of
Amit being in Pune yesterday?

1513
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:23,667
Are you questioning me
or doubting me?

1514
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:26,082
Both.

1515
01:36:27,333 --> 01:36:28,625
Look, Chaube.

1516
01:36:29,792 --> 01:36:32,208
The number of years
you've been playing cop,

1517
01:36:32,292 --> 01:36:34,083
I've been playing politics.

1518
01:36:34,208 --> 01:36:36,167
Do you think I'll allow
something so stupid?

1519
01:36:38,292 --> 01:36:41,083
Amit is a rascal
but he's not stupid.

1520
01:36:42,458 --> 01:36:43,542
Do you think he'll commit murder...

1521
01:36:43,625 --> 01:36:46,833
and then leave his handkerchief
on his shoulder to get caught?

1522
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:48,833
For now, circumstances and evidence

1523
01:36:48,917 --> 01:36:50,958
are both against your brother, Shellar.

1524
01:36:52,583 --> 01:36:55,000
And if my investigation
leads me to your brother,

1525
01:36:56,708 --> 01:36:57,708
I will not step back.

1526
01:36:57,792 --> 01:36:59,792
Did I ask you to step back?

1527
01:37:01,417 --> 01:37:05,417
Remember, I support my brother.

1528
01:37:06,083 --> 01:37:07,417
Madhavrao Shellar.

1529
01:37:09,375 --> 01:37:10,333
Go.

1530
01:37:14,125 --> 01:37:18,292
In the name of Allah
who is merciful and benevolent.

1531
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:23,500
All of you, please pray
for the soul of the deceased.

1532
01:38:12,958 --> 01:38:13,958
Who is it?

1533
01:38:14,625 --> 01:38:16,000
Are you crying?

1534
01:38:18,292 --> 01:38:20,333
One day you too, will have to cry, sir.

1535
01:38:22,208 --> 01:38:24,125
The day you cut onions at home.

1536
01:38:25,458 --> 01:38:26,708
Come, Inspector Chaube.

1537
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:29,583
Will you have vegetables
made in the Kolhapuri style?

1538
01:38:37,292 --> 01:38:38,375
What do you do?

1539
01:38:39,667 --> 01:38:41,125
I am self-employed, sir.

1540
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:46,667
I know a bit about sound
and I make do with it.

1541
01:38:47,417 --> 01:38:48,583
Where were you last night?

1542
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:50,250
At home, sir.

1543
01:38:51,792 --> 01:38:53,708
People stay awake
because of the noise,

1544
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,833
and the silence doesn't
let me sleep.

1545
01:38:56,792 --> 01:38:58,082
Yet, I am trying, sir.

1546
01:38:58,958 --> 01:39:01,625
Is there a witness who can confirm
you were home last night?

1547
01:39:02,208 --> 01:39:04,208
What sort of question is that, sir?

1548
01:39:05,208 --> 01:39:07,958
Does anyone keep a witness
while they sleep?

1549
01:39:10,875 --> 01:39:13,167
But sir, why are you asking me
 these questions?

1550
01:39:13,333 --> 01:39:15,250
Because Wasim was murdered last night.

1551
01:39:15,625 --> 01:39:18,125
And you think that I did it?

1552
01:39:18,417 --> 01:39:19,957
At first, I didn't think so.

1553
01:39:20,375 --> 01:39:23,792
But, seeing you at Wasim's burial today
got me thinking about it.

1554
01:39:24,542 --> 01:39:25,750
Then, I remembered your challenge.

1555
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:26,917
Did you forget?

1556
01:39:27,417 --> 01:39:31,583
Sir, I said that in a fit of rage.

1557
01:39:33,125 --> 01:39:36,292
And why would I murder Wasim?

1558
01:39:36,417 --> 01:39:38,000
Because he raped your wife.

1559
01:39:38,083 --> 01:39:39,750
For which you found no evidence, sir.

1560
01:39:39,833 --> 01:39:41,208
Then, why did your wife commit suicide?

1561
01:39:41,333 --> 01:39:43,250
Sir, what are you here to investigate?

1562
01:39:43,833 --> 01:39:46,457
Wasim's murder or my wife's suicide?

1563
01:39:46,542 --> 01:39:49,458
An eye for an eye makes
the whole world blind, Mr. Bhatnagar.

1564
01:39:49,792 --> 01:39:51,417
A perfect world, sir.

1565
01:39:52,208 --> 01:39:55,958
If everyone is blind,
no one will need the police.

1566
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,750
Sir, have you ever arrested a blind person
in a rape or murder case?

1567
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:07,000
A perfect world, sir.

1568
01:40:07,417 --> 01:40:08,667
Where everyone is blind.

1569
01:40:10,583 --> 01:40:12,542
By leaving behind
Amit's handkerchief next to Wasim,

1570
01:40:12,667 --> 01:40:15,042
you've tried to mislead the police.

1571
01:40:16,625 --> 01:40:18,958
But, the road ahead won't be so easy.

1572
01:40:20,083 --> 01:40:22,375
-I know that now Amit--
-Will burn, sir.

1573
01:40:26,542 --> 01:40:27,875
The food, sir.

1574
01:40:28,917 --> 01:40:30,083
Please let go of my hand.

1575
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:31,583
It will burn.

1576
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,292
Thank you, sir.

1577
01:40:36,375 --> 01:40:39,417
It doesn't feel right to use
the third degree on a blind man.

1578
01:40:40,833 --> 01:40:43,375
But, if needed, I won't hold back.

1579
01:40:43,875 --> 01:40:45,875
The next time we meet,
it won't be in your kitchen,

1580
01:40:46,792 --> 01:40:48,500
but in our interrogation room.

1581
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,125
Remember that.

1582
01:40:56,792 --> 01:40:59,833
If only you can find evidence
against me, sir.

1583
01:41:03,792 --> 01:41:05,083
-Did you call, sir?
-Yes.

1584
01:41:05,542 --> 01:41:07,583
Did you get Amit
and Wasim's call records?

1585
01:41:07,667 --> 01:41:08,792
We'll get them by tomorrow.

1586
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:10,833
Did you get Shakeel's statement?

1587
01:41:10,917 --> 01:41:11,917
Yes, sir.

1588
01:41:12,333 --> 01:41:13,625
He is very angry with Amit.

1589
01:41:14,167 --> 01:41:15,708
He said that he would avenge
his son's death

1590
01:41:15,792 --> 01:41:17,500
before the mud in his
grave dries off.

1591
01:41:17,875 --> 01:41:19,667
Amit is going through a bad time, sir.

1592
01:41:20,375 --> 01:41:22,417
-All right.
-Thank you, sir.

1593
01:41:31,125 --> 01:41:33,500
-Hello.
-Hello, this is Nalawde.

1594
01:41:33,583 --> 01:41:34,667
Tell me, Nalawde.

1595
01:41:34,917 --> 01:41:37,208
-You are in Pune, aren't you?
-Yes, where else will I go?

1596
01:41:39,417 --> 01:41:41,250
They found your handkerchief
on Wasim's body.

1597
01:41:41,708 --> 01:41:43,667
Have all of you gone crazy?

1598
01:41:44,125 --> 01:41:45,375
I did not kill Wasim.

1599
01:41:47,417 --> 01:41:48,542
I know.

1600
01:41:49,792 --> 01:41:51,042
I even know who killed him.

1601
01:41:51,625 --> 01:41:52,750
It's your turn next.

1602
01:41:52,958 --> 01:41:54,583
Tell me his name.

1603
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:56,000
He will be next.

1604
01:41:56,083 --> 01:41:57,292
Not on the phone.

1605
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,125
Meet me.

1606
01:41:59,583 --> 01:42:01,625
You know where to meet, right?

1607
01:42:01,917 --> 01:42:03,458
How would I know if you haven't told me?

1608
01:42:03,542 --> 01:42:05,792
What warehouse did you
keep those blind people in?

1609
01:42:06,083 --> 01:42:07,124
The one at Madh. Why?

1610
01:42:07,292 --> 01:42:08,833
Exactly! There.

1611
01:42:10,125 --> 01:42:11,167
And listen,

1612
01:42:12,625 --> 01:42:14,625
I don't want anyone else there.

1613
01:42:15,708 --> 01:42:18,625
We have to meet in utmost secrecy.

1614
01:42:19,250 --> 01:42:20,417
All right.

1615
01:43:02,167 --> 01:43:04,375
Rohan, are you ok?

1616
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:35,833
Blind guy, you?

1617
01:43:39,875 --> 01:43:42,417
But... Nalawde's voice?

1618
01:43:42,667 --> 01:43:44,042
How did you manage his voice?

1619
01:43:46,167 --> 01:43:48,250
Rohan, you are quite the artist.

1620
01:43:48,417 --> 01:43:49,583
What a plan?

1621
01:43:54,458 --> 01:43:57,708
Blind fellow, I am not Wasim.

1622
01:43:57,875 --> 01:44:00,208
I am not going to die so easy.

1623
01:44:00,375 --> 01:44:02,125
Avenging yourself?

1624
01:44:04,208 --> 01:44:06,125
Will you take revenge?

1625
01:44:09,417 --> 01:44:10,250
Now?

1626
01:44:10,458 --> 01:44:12,874
Do you have a plan B now?

1627
01:44:14,208 --> 01:44:16,250
You want to play the game
of revenge, right?

1628
01:44:16,583 --> 01:44:17,542
Let's play.

1629
01:44:17,624 --> 01:44:18,582
Here.

1630
01:44:18,667 --> 01:44:19,625
Pick it up.

1631
01:44:20,875 --> 01:44:21,875
Up!

1632
01:44:24,458 --> 01:44:27,042
You hit me once... I'll hit you once.

1633
01:44:27,417 --> 01:44:29,000
Hit me.

1634
01:44:30,333 --> 01:44:31,167
Hit me.

1635
01:44:33,749 --> 01:44:34,707
It's my turn.

1636
01:44:35,083 --> 01:44:36,167
Give it.

1637
01:44:38,792 --> 01:44:39,792
Give it to me.

1638
01:44:47,042 --> 01:44:48,250
I have to hand it to you.

1639
01:44:48,833 --> 01:44:51,708
You are blind, but gutsy.

1640
01:46:00,667 --> 01:46:03,332
Handsome! Are you dead?

1641
01:46:04,125 --> 01:46:06,833
Your wife was stronger than you.

1642
01:46:07,958 --> 01:46:11,125
I had to try very hard to
 bring her under control.

1643
01:46:13,042 --> 01:46:14,417
Especially the second time.

1644
01:46:19,250 --> 01:46:20,167
Here.

1645
01:46:20,708 --> 01:46:22,167
I am giving you one last chance.

1646
01:46:22,749 --> 01:46:23,791
Pick it up.

1647
01:46:23,958 --> 01:46:24,832
Come on.

1648
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:22,375
If you had continued to wear your shoes,
you may have survived.

1649
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:26,625
Even a dead man can
smell your socks.

1650
01:47:33,083 --> 01:47:34,292
Now, you tell me...

1651
01:47:35,708 --> 01:47:36,917
do you have a plan B?

1652
01:47:40,708 --> 01:47:42,000
You were right.

1653
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:45,625
-I am taking my revenge.
-Hey!

1654
01:47:47,583 --> 01:47:49,000
You didn't kill Supriya.

1655
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:50,417
No.

1656
01:47:50,750 --> 01:47:52,167
I won't kill you either.

1657
01:47:57,458 --> 01:47:58,875
Do you know who will kill you?

1658
01:47:59,333 --> 01:48:00,250
No.

1659
01:48:00,708 --> 01:48:01,917
I'll tell you.

1660
01:48:02,458 --> 01:48:03,292
I'll tell you.

1661
01:48:10,542 --> 01:48:11,417
Tell me.

1662
01:48:11,708 --> 01:48:13,125
Brother, it's Amit.

1663
01:48:13,917 --> 01:48:16,125
He has tied me up
in the Madh godown, brother.

1664
01:48:16,458 --> 01:48:17,792
Please come and save me.

1665
01:48:18,208 --> 01:48:19,333
I'll tell you everything.

1666
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:20,333
I am coming, Amit.

1667
01:48:20,833 --> 01:48:21,667
I am coming.

1668
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:23,042
Please, brother.

1669
01:48:26,083 --> 01:48:27,374
I am an artist.

1670
01:48:27,833 --> 01:48:29,083
I agree.

1671
01:48:31,250 --> 01:48:32,208
I am good.

1672
01:48:32,292 --> 01:48:33,917
-Rohan...
-I am so good.

1673
01:48:35,208 --> 01:48:36,292
Rohan, let me go.

1674
01:48:36,833 --> 01:48:37,874
Rohan...

1675
01:48:39,625 --> 01:48:40,707
Rohan, what are you doing?

1676
01:49:02,917 --> 01:49:03,792
Rohan, don't do this.

1677
01:49:05,833 --> 01:49:07,083
I said I was sorry, Rohan.

1678
01:49:07,167 --> 01:49:08,458
Let me go.

1679
01:49:08,542 --> 01:49:10,125
Rohan, what are you doing?

1680
01:49:40,417 --> 01:49:41,542
Amit!

1681
01:49:42,917 --> 01:49:43,750
Amit!

1682
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:48,833
Amit!

1683
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:51,125
Amit!

1684
01:49:51,417 --> 01:49:52,417
Don't you worry.

1685
01:49:52,833 --> 01:49:53,750
Don't worry, I am coming.

1686
01:49:54,042 --> 01:49:54,917
I am coming!

1687
01:51:11,083 --> 01:51:11,958
Sir...

1688
01:51:12,124 --> 01:51:13,124
Where is the body?

1689
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:14,833
The body is completely burnt, sir.

1690
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,667
He didn't burn himself,
he's been burnt.

1691
01:51:19,917 --> 01:51:21,958
Shakeel has burnt him.

1692
01:51:22,125 --> 01:51:23,667
Shakeel is still in the ICU
in the hospital.

1693
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:25,708
Find out who did this.

1694
01:51:26,125 --> 01:51:30,875
Or the whole city will burn
just like my brother did.

1695
01:51:32,042 --> 01:51:32,875
Let's go.

1696
01:51:42,542 --> 01:51:44,208
Sir, I am sure the blind guy
is playing his game.

1697
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:46,375
I suggest taking him in.

1698
01:51:46,917 --> 01:51:48,083
Are you crazy?

1699
01:51:48,708 --> 01:51:50,417
We don't have any evidence.

1700
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:53,000
To top it off, he's blind.

1701
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,375
All the social organizations
and the media will hound us.

1702
01:52:09,208 --> 01:52:11,208
Rohan, you did as promised.

1703
01:52:12,667 --> 01:52:13,750
Enough.

1704
01:52:14,875 --> 01:52:16,542
Get back to work.

1705
01:52:17,333 --> 01:52:19,792
Get back to your life, Rohan.

1706
01:52:21,792 --> 01:52:23,208
No, Su.

1707
01:52:26,125 --> 01:52:27,917
There is still work to be done.

1708
01:52:31,667 --> 01:52:33,458
This episode is not over.

1709
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:37,125
Rohan, who were you talking to?

1710
01:52:37,541 --> 01:52:38,666
How did you get hurt?

1711
01:52:39,208 --> 01:52:40,292
It's nothing.

1712
01:52:40,833 --> 01:52:41,833
Listen,

1713
01:52:42,417 --> 01:52:43,750
are you bunking school again?

1714
01:52:43,917 --> 01:52:47,333
There is a football match between
our colony and Navjivan society.

1715
01:52:47,458 --> 01:52:48,792
I am going for practice.

1716
01:52:48,874 --> 01:52:51,082
Percy, you are a lost cause.

1717
01:52:51,417 --> 01:52:52,250
And what now?

1718
01:52:52,333 --> 01:52:54,917
Now, speak to the principal or
I will get a scolding.

1719
01:52:56,583 --> 01:52:58,750
And one day, if your father finds out.

1720
01:52:58,833 --> 01:53:00,500
Then what? You and I.

1721
01:53:00,583 --> 01:53:01,958
Don't worry. Nothing will happen.

1722
01:53:02,042 --> 01:53:04,292
Please. For the colony's sake.

1723
01:53:04,375 --> 01:53:05,208
All right.

1724
01:53:05,292 --> 01:53:06,750
But, this is the last time, Percy.

1725
01:53:06,833 --> 01:53:07,792
Yes.

1726
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:16,250
Percy Dastoor.

1727
01:53:16,542 --> 01:53:18,292
Percy Dastoor's father.

1728
01:53:20,042 --> 01:53:21,542
Hello, Father Rodrigues.

1729
01:53:22,167 --> 01:53:23,292
Good morning, Father.

1730
01:53:24,167 --> 01:53:26,125
This is Cyrus. Percy's father.

1731
01:53:27,458 --> 01:53:30,792
I am so sorry, Father
but Percy has fallen sick again.

1732
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:34,167
We tell him so much,
but he eats so much junk.

1733
01:53:35,708 --> 01:53:38,749
From today, we won't let him
eat junk food even by mistake.

1734
01:53:39,708 --> 01:53:41,375
Nor will we let him miss school.

1735
01:53:44,917 --> 01:53:46,125
Yes, Father.

1736
01:53:46,207 --> 01:53:47,957
Of course, Father.
Don't worry.

1737
01:53:54,708 --> 01:53:56,917
So, the secret is in your voice.

1738
01:54:00,792 --> 01:54:05,667
I kept wondering why Wasim went
to that closed theatre to meet Amit?

1739
01:54:06,667 --> 01:54:10,500
It was their drinking spot,
but Amit was in Pune.

1740
01:54:11,458 --> 01:54:13,125
Why would he come
to Mumbai from Pune...

1741
01:54:13,458 --> 01:54:15,250
when he was safer in Pune?

1742
01:54:16,708 --> 01:54:18,167
Who called him?

1743
01:54:18,625 --> 01:54:19,833
Why did he agree?

1744
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:22,500
Whose voice did you mimic to call him?

1745
01:54:24,250 --> 01:54:25,792
You are very talented, Rohan Bhatnagar.

1746
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Remember...

1747
01:54:28,833 --> 01:54:31,750
you told me there would be
no lifeline in this game?

1748
01:54:32,042 --> 01:54:34,417
But, you have given me
a lifeline on your own.

1749
01:54:35,042 --> 01:54:36,458
24 hours.

1750
01:54:37,417 --> 01:54:39,125
And this case will be closed.

1751
01:54:40,042 --> 01:54:41,000
Thank you, sir.

1752
01:54:41,708 --> 01:54:42,750
For what?

1753
01:54:44,083 --> 01:54:45,500
For the 24 hours.

1754
01:54:46,792 --> 01:54:47,833
Nalawde,

1755
01:54:48,125 --> 01:54:50,000
get me Rohan Bhatnagar's
call records and keep them ready.

1756
01:54:50,167 --> 01:54:51,708
-It's urgent!
-Ok, sir.

1757
01:54:51,792 --> 01:54:54,125
Get Amit and Wasim's call records too
and keep them on my table.

1758
01:54:54,208 --> 01:54:55,292
I'll check them myself.

1759
01:54:55,417 --> 01:54:57,000
-How many men are at the police station?
-There are four, sir.

1760
01:54:57,083 --> 01:54:59,125
Get everyone to Guru Kripa
colony immediately.

1761
01:54:59,208 --> 01:55:00,042
Ok, sir.

1762
01:55:00,125 --> 01:55:01,500
-We have to keep a watch on someone.
-Yes, sir.

1763
01:55:01,708 --> 01:55:03,042
Yes... now.

1764
01:55:07,417 --> 01:55:08,792
I am giving you 24 hours.

1765
01:55:08,958 --> 01:55:11,875
But, we won't take our
eyes off you for even a second.

1766
01:55:14,625 --> 01:55:15,667
Inspector Chaube...

1767
01:55:17,625 --> 01:55:19,333
will you answer a question for me?

1768
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:22,917
Truthfully.

1769
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:29,667
If you were in my place,

1770
01:55:31,125 --> 01:55:32,958
what would you have done
to Wasim and Amit?

1771
01:55:39,167 --> 01:55:41,292
I am in no hurry for your reply, sir.

1772
01:55:44,042 --> 01:55:46,667
But, the day you answer me truthfully,

1773
01:55:49,167 --> 01:55:50,792
I won't lie to you.

1774
01:56:17,708 --> 01:56:19,000
Hey, WhatsApp club.

1775
01:56:19,417 --> 01:56:20,250
Yes, sir...

1776
01:56:20,542 --> 01:56:21,375
Be alert.

1777
01:56:21,792 --> 01:56:23,582
You slack, and there will be trouble.

1778
01:56:23,667 --> 01:56:25,292
Switch off the mobiles
and keep a watch.

1779
01:56:25,417 --> 01:56:27,208
-Yes, sir.
-Fools...

1780
01:56:34,332 --> 01:56:37,582
The time is 10:20 a.m.

1781
01:56:40,083 --> 01:56:41,167
-Sarmalkar,
-Yes...

1782
01:56:41,292 --> 01:56:43,292
I am messaging you
four landline numbers.

1783
01:56:43,792 --> 01:56:45,167
Give me their addresses.
It's very urgent.

1784
01:56:47,125 --> 01:56:50,457
The time is nine o'clock p.m.

1785
01:56:54,625 --> 01:56:55,917
-Sarmalkar.
-Yes, sir.

1786
01:56:56,208 --> 01:56:58,083
-I gave you four numbers.
-Yes.

1787
01:56:58,625 --> 01:56:59,792
You've messaged the address
for only one number.

1788
01:56:59,875 --> 01:57:02,083
-Where are the rest?
-Sir, all four have the same address.

1789
01:57:02,167 --> 01:57:04,458
-What?
-Yes, I did a thorough check.

1790
01:57:05,333 --> 01:57:07,083
-They all have the same address?
-Yes, sir.

1791
01:57:07,167 --> 01:57:08,708
That's why I sent one message.

1792
01:57:10,250 --> 01:57:11,333
All right.

1793
01:57:16,958 --> 01:57:17,792
Hey!

1794
01:57:21,333 --> 01:57:22,875
Where are you headed
this late in the night?

1795
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,208
Sir, in Mumbai, this time is not late.

1796
01:57:25,292 --> 01:57:27,542
And, even if I want to go somewhere,
do I need permission?

1797
01:57:27,708 --> 01:57:28,542
Hey!

1798
01:57:28,792 --> 01:57:30,375
Don't get smart with me.

1799
01:57:31,750 --> 01:57:34,125
You are Bhatnagar's friend, aren't you?

1800
01:57:34,292 --> 01:57:35,167
Yes.

1801
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:36,542
Is that a problem, too?

1802
01:57:37,917 --> 01:57:39,208
Which of them is Rohan?

1803
01:57:39,542 --> 01:57:41,792
Sir, this is my family.

1804
01:57:42,125 --> 01:57:43,708
But, I'll show you their faces.

1805
01:57:43,875 --> 01:57:45,250
Because you are mistaken.

1806
01:57:45,333 --> 01:57:46,208
Come to the side.

1807
01:57:46,292 --> 01:57:47,958
-Come.
-There.

1808
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:51,125
Parveen.

1809
01:57:54,083 --> 01:57:55,292
Are you satisfied?

1810
01:57:55,417 --> 01:57:56,500
Can I go now?

1811
01:57:56,625 --> 01:57:57,625
Go.

1812
01:58:15,250 --> 01:58:16,750
What time does this open
in the morning?

1813
01:58:16,917 --> 01:58:18,292
7:00, sir.

1814
01:58:23,833 --> 01:58:25,208
-Hello, sir.
-Nalawde.

1815
01:58:26,167 --> 01:58:27,125
Is everything ok there?

1816
01:58:27,250 --> 01:58:28,292
Yes, sir. It's all ok.

1817
01:58:28,375 --> 01:58:29,667
Just be alert.

1818
01:58:30,792 --> 01:58:32,208
This case will be closed
 by tomorrow morning.

1819
01:58:32,292 --> 01:58:33,292
Yes, sir.

1820
01:58:38,958 --> 01:58:41,083
Sir, Chaube is here.

1821
01:58:54,792 --> 01:58:56,750
I would've definitely
offered you a drink...

1822
01:58:57,708 --> 01:58:59,458
but you won't drink with me.

1823
01:58:59,750 --> 01:59:00,792
I will, today.

1824
01:59:01,292 --> 01:59:02,167
Why?

1825
01:59:04,208 --> 01:59:06,083
Are you feeling sorry for me today?

1826
01:59:06,708 --> 01:59:08,125
It's not that, Shellar.

1827
01:59:09,667 --> 01:59:11,208
You never understood...

1828
01:59:12,333 --> 01:59:14,042
but I've always helped you.

1829
01:59:14,750 --> 01:59:16,708
After the rape, when you called me...

1830
01:59:17,208 --> 01:59:19,333
I handed both of them over to Nalawde.

1831
01:59:19,791 --> 01:59:21,957
Knowing, that he would
 hand them over to you.

1832
01:59:24,250 --> 01:59:25,208
In Wasim's case,

1833
01:59:25,292 --> 01:59:27,500
if I wanted to, I could've arrested
your brother from Pune.

1834
01:59:28,208 --> 01:59:29,417
But, I didn't.

1835
01:59:29,958 --> 01:59:30,917
Why?

1836
01:59:31,083 --> 01:59:34,458
Because I call for a show only when
I have all three aces in my hand.

1837
01:59:34,958 --> 01:59:38,375
Now, neither you; nor this city
has to burn.

1838
01:59:40,417 --> 01:59:43,208
Because we've found the person
who burned your brother.

1839
01:59:47,875 --> 01:59:48,958
Tell me the name.

1840
01:59:49,292 --> 01:59:50,292
Name the price?

1841
01:59:59,333 --> 02:00:01,042
Take as much as you want.

1842
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,125
Tell me his name.

1843
02:00:03,667 --> 02:00:05,292
I will hand him over to you
tomorrow morning.

1844
02:00:06,042 --> 02:00:07,542
Not in the morning.

1845
02:00:08,667 --> 02:00:09,917
Right now!

1846
02:00:13,167 --> 02:00:15,500
If I tell you right now,
you won't believe it.

1847
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:19,417
I will get him tomorrow
with a witness and evidence.

1848
02:00:20,208 --> 02:00:21,458
The thing is...

1849
02:00:22,708 --> 02:00:24,583
I will take a promotion
from the government,

1850
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:26,750
and money from you.

1851
02:00:27,792 --> 02:00:28,917
Cheers.

1852
02:00:56,625 --> 02:00:58,041
I would've killed them both.

1853
02:00:59,583 --> 02:01:00,917
Amit and Wasim.

1854
02:01:02,125 --> 02:01:03,667
Remember, you asked me a question?

1855
02:01:06,750 --> 02:01:08,042
How did you kill him?

1856
02:01:10,458 --> 02:01:11,750
Wasim?

1857
02:01:15,750 --> 02:01:17,083
Amit?

1858
02:01:17,375 --> 02:01:18,332
No.

1859
02:01:19,083 --> 02:01:20,333
Shellar.

1860
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:27,583
How did you get out of the colony?

1861
02:01:32,708 --> 02:01:34,083
-Zafar.
-Yes, Rohan?

1862
02:01:34,167 --> 02:01:35,042
Listen.

1863
02:01:35,458 --> 02:01:38,625
I need yours, Percy's and
Sakharam's help.

1864
02:01:38,750 --> 02:01:40,208
Sakharam, who?

1865
02:01:40,458 --> 02:01:42,000
The one who fumigates in the area.

1866
02:01:42,750 --> 02:01:44,625
Where are you headed
this late in the night?

1867
02:02:36,833 --> 02:02:39,750
-Speak.
-Brother, it's me.

1868
02:02:40,292 --> 02:02:41,792
Amit.

1869
02:02:42,208 --> 02:02:43,125
What?

1870
02:02:44,292 --> 02:02:45,125
Amit?

1871
02:02:45,208 --> 02:02:46,333
Brother, we...

1872
02:02:46,542 --> 02:02:48,750
we made a huge mistake, brother.

1873
02:02:49,083 --> 02:02:50,625
I received my punishment for it.

1874
02:02:51,042 --> 02:02:54,499
But, now it's your turn to be punished.

1875
02:02:54,583 --> 02:02:55,542
What rubbish.

1876
02:02:55,875 --> 02:02:57,167
It's not rubbish.

1877
02:02:58,292 --> 02:02:59,833
I am telling you the truth.

1878
02:03:01,833 --> 02:03:02,792
Who is this?

1879
02:03:03,083 --> 02:03:05,083
I am the same person who called
your brother to the godown.

1880
02:03:05,417 --> 02:03:07,332
If you have the balls,
tell me your name.

1881
02:03:08,958 --> 02:03:09,958
Rohan.

1882
02:03:11,708 --> 02:03:12,833
Rohan Bhatnagar.

1883
02:03:13,167 --> 02:03:14,625
Wait. Wait right there.

1884
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,500
I'll come to your house and kill you.

1885
02:03:17,792 --> 02:03:18,875
There's no point in going there.

1886
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:19,958
The police are everywhere.

1887
02:03:20,083 --> 02:03:21,917
Tell me where you are!

1888
02:03:22,875 --> 02:03:24,416
You will come, right?

1889
02:03:25,292 --> 02:03:26,500
You won't chicken out?

1890
02:03:28,375 --> 02:03:29,875
Take down the address.

1891
02:04:04,292 --> 02:04:05,292
Shellar!

1892
02:04:08,042 --> 02:04:09,792
Do you know,
why I called you here?

1893
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:17,458
This is where Su and I
were going to make our home.

1894
02:04:20,042 --> 02:04:21,999
But you people did not let that happen.

1895
02:04:23,917 --> 02:04:25,417
Hey, Bhatnagar!

1896
02:04:27,333 --> 02:04:28,958
Enough is enough.

1897
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:31,542
If you wanted to hide,
why did you call me here?

1898
02:04:32,958 --> 02:04:34,792
Come on out.

1899
02:04:40,917 --> 02:04:42,250
Sir!

1900
02:04:56,167 --> 02:04:57,417
Get him.

1901
02:05:19,625 --> 02:05:20,708
Anna!

1902
02:05:27,250 --> 02:05:28,292
It's your turn now.

1903
02:05:28,708 --> 02:05:29,958
Now what?

1904
02:05:30,750 --> 02:05:32,125
You already played your card.

1905
02:05:32,708 --> 02:05:34,583
I have a plan B for you.

1906
02:05:36,458 --> 02:05:38,250
Your brother asked me
the same question.

1907
02:05:38,708 --> 02:05:39,875
I didn't have a plan B, then.

1908
02:05:40,875 --> 02:05:41,708
I do now.

1909
02:05:46,417 --> 02:05:47,375
Come.

1910
02:07:23,083 --> 02:07:24,125
Drop it.

1911
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,792
It's over Bhatnagar.

1912
02:07:32,292 --> 02:07:34,458
A press of the trigger...

1913
02:07:36,999 --> 02:07:38,957
and your story ends.

1914
02:07:41,333 --> 02:07:43,208
But, that's too easy.

1915
02:07:44,583 --> 02:07:46,917
You killed my Amit in such a way...

1916
02:07:47,375 --> 02:07:49,875
I could not even perform
 his last rites.

1917
02:07:51,125 --> 02:07:52,667
So, I am going to make you suffer.

1918
02:08:10,749 --> 02:08:12,374
Get up!

1919
02:09:23,125 --> 02:09:25,125
My Su didn't have an easy death.

1920
02:09:26,667 --> 02:09:28,958
You will not have an easy death, either.

1921
02:10:34,875 --> 02:10:36,375
I won't die alone.

1922
02:10:38,625 --> 02:10:39,833
We will both fall.

1923
02:10:40,208 --> 02:10:41,458
We will both fall.

1924
02:10:43,292 --> 02:10:45,083
But, only one will die.

1925
02:11:01,167 --> 02:11:02,417
Su committed suicide.

1926
02:11:03,375 --> 02:11:04,708
But, it was a murder.

1927
02:11:05,292 --> 02:11:08,792
This is a murder,
but it'll look like suicide.

1928
02:11:29,333 --> 02:11:33,999
So, Amit killed Wasim,
and Shellar, Amit.

1929
02:11:34,208 --> 02:11:35,708
And repenting on killing his brother,

1930
02:11:35,875 --> 02:11:38,083
Shellar committed suicide.

1931
02:11:39,125 --> 02:11:40,250
Very good.

1932
02:11:41,125 --> 02:11:43,125
That's very smart, Rohan Bhatnagar.

1933
02:11:43,917 --> 02:11:47,625
But, every criminal leaves some
trail behind after committing a crime.

1934
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
You've left a whole witness.

1935
02:11:56,167 --> 02:11:57,458
Just one more hour.

1936
02:11:58,708 --> 02:11:59,750
Don't move.

1937
02:12:01,333 --> 02:12:03,417
Do you remember the fourth option, sir?

1938
02:12:05,208 --> 02:12:06,125
What do you mean?

1939
02:12:09,042 --> 02:12:10,958
It's ok, you'll figure it out...

1940
02:12:15,542 --> 02:12:18,125
but you won't be able
to explain it to anyone else.

1941
02:12:25,958 --> 02:12:27,500
Did this man make calls from here?

1942
02:12:27,583 --> 02:12:29,292
Mimicking different voices.

1943
02:12:30,875 --> 02:12:32,000
Sir?

1944
02:12:33,958 --> 02:12:35,667
If I could see,
I would've surely told you.

1945
02:12:46,583 --> 02:12:48,042
A perfect world, sir.

1946
02:12:48,417 --> 02:12:49,500
Where everyone is blind.

1947
02:12:52,208 --> 02:12:53,083
No.

1948
02:13:12,125 --> 02:13:15,125
I see peace on your face
after many days.

1949
02:13:16,832 --> 02:13:18,916
So what if I am not with you
in the world?

1950
02:13:20,208 --> 02:13:22,083
I'll always be with you, Rohan.

1951
02:13:24,667 --> 02:13:26,125
Walk on.
