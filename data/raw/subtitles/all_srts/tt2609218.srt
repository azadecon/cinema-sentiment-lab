1
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:41,542
Listen it's 9.30 pm,
Let's put off all the lights.

2
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:42,709
Okay.

3
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:31,126
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

4
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:31,792
Rocks.

5
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:33,834
Why did you choose such
a controversial subject..

6
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:35,292
..for your first movie?

7
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:37,501
Look.. madam.

8
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:42,751
You only see sex..

9
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:45,626
..controversy and
scandal in Ragini MMS.

10
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:47,417
I..

11
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,751
I..see a story.

12
00:07:53,584 --> 00:07:56,542
A boy takes a girl
to a lonely bungalow..

13
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:58,292
..for a dirty weekend.

14
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:01,334
Out there he shoots an MMS video.

15
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:03,334
The MMS goes viral.

16
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:06,959
The boy..went missing.

17
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:10,584
The girl says that there
was a witch in that house..

18
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:12,709
..who killed the boy.

19
00:08:14,042 --> 00:08:16,959
But we cannot entirely
trust the girl.

20
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:18,292
Because it's said that..

21
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:20,626
..the girl went insane
after the incident.

22
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,667
Since the last 3 years..

23
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,667
..she's been in a mental asylum.

24
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:29,542
Now that is a story.

25
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:32,334
I will shoot my film..

26
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:35,501
..where Ragini's MMS was shot.

27
00:08:36,126 --> 00:08:37,126
Horr-ex film.

28
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:39,584
A combo of horror and sex.

29
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:43,501
And after watching the
film the audience won't know..

30
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:49,292
..whether to be terrified or excited.

31
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:53,751
Rocks, one more question.
- Go ahead.

32
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:56,501
You've worked with all
the top actors in the industry.

33
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:59,251
But you've hired
TV stars for your film.

34
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:01,626
Is it because after
your last movie flopped..

35
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,084
..no big actor wants
to work with you?

36
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:07,126
This was a conscious
decision, okay.

37
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:10,501
My story.

38
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:11,834
My story is real.

39
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:14,542
This incident is real. Stars.

40
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:16,501
Stars will make it look fake.

41
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:21,209
And as for the female lead,
that is a surprise.

42
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:22,959
She's an actress that makes..

43
00:09:23,001 --> 00:09:25,626
..all the other stars
run for their money.

44
00:09:26,126 --> 00:09:29,959
She is going to put the..
back into Ragini.

45
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:36,417
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I present you..Ragini.

46
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:49,209
"There are many
beautiful-beautiful girls..."

47
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:53,292
"But all eyes staring at you..."

48
00:10:12,251 --> 00:10:16,834
"There are many
beautiful-beautiful girls..."

49
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:21,376
"But all eyes staring at you..."

50
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:23,834
"But what do I say about me.."

51
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:26,084
"Even the moon praises me..."

52
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:32,584
"Every part of my body.."

53
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:41,834
"Oh my baby doll of gold.."

54
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:51,084
"This world is of copper.."

55
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:55,709
"Oh my baby doll of gold.."

56
00:10:55,834 --> 00:11:00,501
"Oh my baby doll of gold.."

57
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:03,417
"Because of dancing all
night your feet are paining..

58
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:05,292
..let me apply Zandu balm on them.."

59
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:10,042
"You will feel tired because of dancing
too much, take rest in my arms.."

60
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:12,626
"Because of dancing all
night your feet are paining..

61
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:14,584
..let me apply Zandu balm on them.."

62
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,209
"You will feel tired because of dancing
too much, take rest in my arms.."

63
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:23,834
"My anklet will keep creating
noise if your feet pains.."

64
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:28,542
"I will apply Zandu balm on them.."

65
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:33,042
"My anklet will keep creating
noise if your feet pains.."

66
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:37,709
"I will apply Zandu balm on them.."

67
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:47,042
"Everyone always talks about me."

68
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:55,709
"This world is of copper.."

69
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:58,126
"Oh my baby doll of gold.."

70
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:00,376
"Oh my baby doll of gold.."

71
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:02,667
"Oh my baby doll of gold.."

72
00:12:02,751 --> 00:12:05,209
"Oh my baby doll of gold.."

73
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:51,042
"This world is of copper.."

74
00:12:51,209 --> 00:13:00,376
"Oh my baby doll of gold.."

75
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:04,959
"Oh my baby doll of gold.."

76
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:09,876
"Oh my baby doll of gold.."

77
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:17,376
Thank you. Thank you.

78
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:18,459
Hold it.

79
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:20,126
The action was superb.

80
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:21,001
What an entry.

81
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:22,334
Is this skull fine?

82
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:24,876
And you are?
- Gina. Art department.

83
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:26,001
Yes, whatever.

84
00:13:26,376 --> 00:13:27,459
Leave it.

85
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:29,084
We'll make a blockbuster.

86
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:31,501
Yes, daddy. - Tanya.

87
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:33,626
Hi.

88
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:35,959
Is that Ashish Kapoor? - Yes.

89
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:38,292
Please tell him
I loved his last film.

90
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,917
Just loved it. - Sure.

91
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:41,959
I am sorry, daddy.

92
00:13:42,501 --> 00:13:43,834
Nobody, it's just Rocks.

93
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:47,667
If she wasn't Ashish
Kapoor's daughter..

94
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:49,459
..I would've never
made her my assistant.

95
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:51,876
What a waste.

96
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:54,084
She never does any work..

97
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,917
..or good for anything else.

98
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:00,084
Sunny's room.

99
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:01,584
Sunny's makeup room.

100
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:02,876
Sunny.

101
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,501
Sunny.

102
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:06,792
Sunny.

103
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:16,334
Close your eyes. - Why?

104
00:14:16,626 --> 00:14:18,042
Did you sign her cheque?

105
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,459
Close your eyes.

106
00:14:33,626 --> 00:14:35,667
Hello, gorgeousness.

107
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,126
No one taught you to knock?

108
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:40,876
Actually, no.

109
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:48,501
I just wanted to ask
whether it hurt too much.

110
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:50,751
Hurt when?

111
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:53,334
When you fell from Heaven.

112
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:58,126
Why are you knocking
when the door is open?

113
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:00,084
Because that's what gentlemen do.

114
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:01,751
Please come in.

115
00:15:03,626 --> 00:15:04,667
You called me.

116
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:07,792
You two haven't been
introduced properly.

117
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:10,042
This is Satyakumar.

118
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:12,084
Failed novelist but in future..

119
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:15,167
..he's going to be
a super-hit script writer.

120
00:15:15,751 --> 00:15:17,501
Because he's met me. - Hi.

121
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,542
I read your last novel.

122
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:22,042
You read books?

123
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:27,751
And scripts too.

124
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:30,751
If you had sent
your script on time..

125
00:15:31,084 --> 00:15:32,459
..I would've read that too.

126
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:35,876
I should go. - Yes.

127
00:15:36,126 --> 00:15:37,667
Anyway, we've already
talked too much.

128
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:45,501
And anyway, you've to
get ready for the after-party.

129
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:47,501
The entire cast
and crew will be there.

130
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:49,542
And the two supporting
actors of our film..

131
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:51,584
..Monali and Maddy,
you can meet them too.

132
00:15:51,876 --> 00:15:53,167
Sorry, I can't.

133
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:55,751
I've to visit the mental
asylum tomorrow morning.

134
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:57,876
Mental asylum? Are you okay?

135
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:00,876
I finally got permission
to meet Ragini.

136
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:02,459
Ragini?

137
00:16:03,626 --> 00:16:05,417
Why do you want to meet Ragini?

138
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:08,126
Research, obviously.

139
00:16:09,126 --> 00:16:11,251
So if you will excuse me, goodnight.

140
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:14,792
Research?

141
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:17,251
How did porno turn into Rituporno.

142
00:16:18,334 --> 00:16:19,417
Why are you laughing?

143
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:22,001
Has the guy who'll
shoot the making reached?

144
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:23,292
Yes, sir, he has.

145
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:38,959
Hi, I am Karan.

146
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:41,501
And I am going to take
you behind the scenes..

147
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,709
..of India's most awaited film,
Ragini MMS 2.

148
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:51,417
I know that you all want
to see Sunny Leone, and not me.

149
00:16:52,626 --> 00:16:55,959
Anyway, the rest of the
film unit will arrive tomorrow.

150
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:58,751
Till the while we
will control and do.

151
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:02,167
And you know that the
joy of a horror film set..

152
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:05,459
..it's best experienced
alone at night.

153
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:10,709
Let's check it out and be scared.

154
00:17:11,084 --> 00:17:13,251
Ragini MMS, Day zero.

155
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:14,459
Come.

156
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:27,709
What is this?

157
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,417
What is this?

158
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:34,334
Why has this not been
painted for shooting?

159
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:36,376
This does not look proper.

160
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:56,459
Who's that?

161
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:03,459
Who's that?

162
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:19,751
What is here?

163
00:18:32,584 --> 00:18:35,084
This room seems familiar, right.

164
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:43,501
This is the same room
where Uday and Ragini..

165
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,084
Someone make my MMS too.

166
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,001
What the hell is this?

167
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:14,251
Handcuffs, and pink.

168
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:17,834
Uday, you are a scoundrel.

169
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:21,501
And Ragini, you're kinky too.

170
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:27,584
I've got to watch
Ragini's MMS on this bed.

171
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,501
Oh yeah.

172
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:36,084
Dirty little thing.

173
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:48,667
Who's there?

174
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:55,126
Who is trying to be funny?

175
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:04,584
Who's in the cupboard?

176
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:16,834
Who's that?

177
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:23,709
Who's that?

178
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:42,876
You know Ragini?

179
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:47,709
Be careful.

180
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:20,751
Hi, Ragini.

181
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:25,917
I am Sunny.

182
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:39,334
We're making a film..

183
00:21:40,376 --> 00:21:43,876
..about what happened
with you and Uday.

184
00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:51,167
And..I am playing Ragini.

185
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:02,167
Tell me, Ragini, people say..

186
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:03,876
..there's something in that house.

187
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:08,667
There's a witch in that house.

188
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:12,042
She killed Uday.

189
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:14,876
She won't spare me either.

190
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:16,542
She will kill me too.

191
00:22:18,126 --> 00:22:19,459
She's right here.

192
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:22,501
Standing behind me.

193
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:27,584
She will kill me. Save me. - Ragini.

194
00:22:27,709 --> 00:22:30,251
Ragini, there's no one behind you.
- No, no, please save me.

195
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:32,459
Ragini, there's no one behind you.

196
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:33,501
No, no.

197
00:22:33,501 --> 00:22:34,834
Ragini, calm down.

198
00:22:37,292 --> 00:22:39,292
I killed him.

199
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,959
I killed him.

200
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:50,709
His blood was accumulating
near my feet.

201
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:52,584
Ragini..

202
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:56,417
I was enjoying it.

203
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:01,001
I killed him.

204
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:05,584
Please save me.

205
00:23:06,126 --> 00:23:08,042
Please save me.
Standing behind me.

206
00:23:08,126 --> 00:23:10,501
Ragini, there's no one behind you.

207
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:11,876
Please save me. - Calm down.

208
00:23:25,459 --> 00:23:27,334
I'm not a witch.

209
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:28,501
Ragini, I am sorry.

210
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:31,501
I didn't kill my children.

211
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:32,959
What are you doing?

212
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:34,167
Nurse.

213
00:23:35,084 --> 00:23:36,626
Ragini, no!

214
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,459
Ragini, no!

215
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:41,876
Come.

216
00:24:00,584 --> 00:24:03,209
Doctor, I know what
happened with Ragini.

217
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,001
We all know what
happened with Ragini.

218
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:07,376
She attacked herself.

219
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:08,792
That's what I am trying to say,
doctor.

220
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:10,417
She didn't attack herself.

221
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:13,459
She was compelled to do it.
- What do you mean?

222
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:14,792
Doctor.

223
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:18,209
I'll handle it. - Yes.

224
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:20,417
Yes.

225
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:24,376
Doctor, please listen to me once.

226
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:25,501
Come sit.

227
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:27,251
Let's sit and talk.

228
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:31,292
Tell me.

229
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:34,334
Doctor,
I know you won't believe me.

230
00:24:35,376 --> 00:24:38,709
And I was trying to explain to Dr.
Batra that..

231
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:41,209
Ragini's cell is colder than normal.

232
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:44,667
Ragini feels no sensation.

233
00:24:45,876 --> 00:24:47,042
Cold and hot..

234
00:24:47,584 --> 00:24:48,584
Pain.

235
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:53,126
Ragini keeps repeating
the same action all the time.

236
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:56,042
And the doctors are treating her..

237
00:24:56,084 --> 00:24:57,834
..for multiple
personality disorder.

238
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:02,667
Look, there's no one
solution for such problems.

239
00:25:04,126 --> 00:25:05,376
Every case is different.

240
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:07,792
And to know that..

241
00:25:08,126 --> 00:25:09,834
..we've to get to
the root of the problem.

242
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:14,001
Don't worry, give me some time.

243
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,459
Excuse me. - Yes, ma'am.

244
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:27,959
Who is she?

245
00:25:28,251 --> 00:25:29,709
She's Dr. Meera Dutta.

246
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:31,876
She just arrived
from New York last week.

247
00:25:32,001 --> 00:25:33,001
She's a bit strange, but..

248
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:35,126
..she's one of the best
psychiatrist in the world.

249
00:25:35,376 --> 00:25:36,501
Why strange?

250
00:25:36,626 --> 00:25:39,626
Because she chooses
only those cases..

251
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:41,626
..for which medical
science has no answer.

252
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:55,626
Hello, gorgeousness.

253
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:00,834
Is it hot or is it just you.

254
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:12,167
Hi.

255
00:26:13,126 --> 00:26:15,917
I am sorry,
he's the original spoilsport.

256
00:26:33,126 --> 00:26:34,084
What happened?

257
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,334
Upset over something?

258
00:26:37,751 --> 00:26:38,751
Nothing.

259
00:26:39,584 --> 00:26:40,709
I just got a headache.

260
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:45,251
Since I met Ragini..

261
00:26:47,084 --> 00:26:48,459
..I am feeling a bit sick.

262
00:26:49,084 --> 00:26:51,126
That's bound to happen
if you meet a psycho.

263
00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:52,709
Stay with normal people.

264
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:56,084
And you will stay happy.

265
00:26:57,792 --> 00:27:00,542
And you think you're normal?

266
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:20,584
Stop the car.

267
00:27:32,501 --> 00:27:33,917
What's written here?

268
00:27:34,292 --> 00:27:36,542
No admission before
sunrise or after sunset.

269
00:27:37,126 --> 00:27:39,626
What's that? - No entry.

270
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:40,876
Nonsense.

271
00:27:41,751 --> 00:27:43,376
It's an ASI signboard, Rocks.

272
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:45,792
It must mean something.
- Who is ASI?

273
00:27:46,251 --> 00:27:49,084
ASI means the Archaeological
Survey of India.

274
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,626
I've read that they
put up such signs..

275
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:55,584
..when some place
is actually haunted.

276
00:27:56,584 --> 00:27:59,126
The Bangar and Ajabghar forts..

277
00:27:59,251 --> 00:28:01,751
..in Rajasthan have the same signs.

278
00:28:09,626 --> 00:28:11,876
You're terrified for no reason.

279
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:14,542
I am sure my over-enthusiastic
art department must have set this up.

280
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:15,542
For the shoot.

281
00:28:15,584 --> 00:28:18,251
You mean we're about
to reach the location? - Yes.

282
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:20,834
It's just two minutes away.

283
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,959
Couldn't you find a
jungle close to the city?

284
00:28:24,042 --> 00:28:26,001
Ask Satya that.

285
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:32,417
It was his mind-blowing
idea to shoot in this bungalow.

286
00:28:37,251 --> 00:28:38,251
Shall we?

287
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:40,001
Yes.

288
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:47,751
Hey, writer. Let's go.

289
00:28:49,209 --> 00:28:53,001
Rocks, a house at
such a place is fine?

290
00:28:53,084 --> 00:28:54,834
The house is a dungeon
from the outside..

291
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:57,042
..but from inside it
is as beautiful as you.

292
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:18,084
"Ragini"

293
00:29:20,376 --> 00:29:22,334
Are we all going to stay here?

294
00:29:22,584 --> 00:29:25,001
Not all. Only the important people.

295
00:29:25,084 --> 00:29:26,167
And the rest of all crew?

296
00:29:26,292 --> 00:29:28,584
The rest of the crew
will stay at a hotel.

297
00:29:28,626 --> 00:29:31,209
Because they think
there is a witch here.

298
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:34,292
What if there is really a witch here?

299
00:29:41,626 --> 00:29:43,542
Then we'll cast her
in this movie too.

300
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:49,834
The rooms here are good, right?

301
00:29:50,084 --> 00:29:52,584
They are better than the hotel which
is 2:30 hours away from here.

302
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:13,251
'Stay miles away from the house.'

303
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:15,126
'That house is jinxed.'

304
00:30:15,876 --> 00:30:18,417
'Keep away from that house.'

305
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:03,584
Mr. Rocks, I want to
discuss few ideas with you.

306
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:11,251
Mr. Rocks,
I have doubts about my character.

307
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:13,042
Shall we discuss them?

308
00:31:23,251 --> 00:31:25,501
Mr. Rocks, don't you think that..

309
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:28,751
..the graph of my
character's a bit down.

310
00:31:29,292 --> 00:31:31,167
Although my character
has many shades.

311
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:35,626
Red, blue, grey, magenta.

312
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:37,792
Oh no!

313
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:40,042
It's got no feelings.

314
00:31:40,209 --> 00:31:41,376
Mood. Mood.

315
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:44,417
What is the sunshine of my character?

316
00:31:56,667 --> 00:32:01,376
This is my room. - I can see that.

317
00:32:02,584 --> 00:32:03,626
Right.

318
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:05,917
This one's my favourite.

319
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:07,001
Favourite.

320
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:08,667
It was a hit show.

321
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:10,084
PKGSNR.

322
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:10,876
What?

323
00:32:10,917 --> 00:32:12,876
"Pyaar Ke Geet Sunaja Re."

324
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:14,334
Right after I left the show..

325
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:16,001
..the channel had
to shut down the show.

326
00:32:16,084 --> 00:32:17,709
My fans messed up everyone.

327
00:32:19,334 --> 00:32:21,376
Why are you asking all this?

328
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:25,709
Are you a journo? - Journo?

329
00:32:28,334 --> 00:32:29,709
Smarty with pony.

330
00:32:30,126 --> 00:32:32,251
You're a fan.
You want an autograph?

331
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:34,126
Take my photograph, okay.

332
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:34,626
Take it.

333
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:36,917
I am looking for my room. - Room?

334
00:32:37,501 --> 00:32:38,584
Your room.

335
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:41,501
I see. So you're an AD.

336
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:42,959
Look, Mr. AD.

337
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:45,459
This is the VIP area, okay.

338
00:32:46,126 --> 00:32:49,292
Actor zone.

339
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:50,792
Now get out.

340
00:32:50,876 --> 00:32:52,501
Now leave. Goodbye.

341
00:32:53,501 --> 00:32:55,959
On your way out tell the spot boy..

342
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:57,501
..to get me a sandwich and a tea.

343
00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:59,876
Brown bread and green tea.

344
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:01,792
He has come to take a room.

345
00:33:02,251 --> 00:33:05,501
Excuse me, Satya,
I've been looking all over for you.

346
00:33:05,876 --> 00:33:09,709
If I would get my cheque then
I would discuss with you.

347
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:11,876
Satyakumar?

348
00:33:12,001 --> 00:33:14,001
Satyakumar.
The Satyakumar.

349
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:16,334
Excuse me.
If I can get a copy of my scenes..

350
00:33:16,417 --> 00:33:17,709
..then I could practice.

351
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:19,959
No one introduced us.

352
00:33:20,084 --> 00:33:21,501
Parvinder Dhillon.
Friends call me Maddy.

353
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:23,167
I have many doubts about a scene.

354
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,501
Can I clarify it with you?

355
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:27,501
She has just one scene.
Sir, talk to me.

356
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:31,042
I am sending you my BBM pin.
Kindly please add me.

357
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:32,709
Tell me your pin first.

358
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:36,501
Then we'll discuss my scenes.
Along with emotions.

359
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:37,667
Give me your pin.

360
00:33:37,709 --> 00:33:40,042
Tell me. - I am thinking of
getting a new phone today.

361
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:41,792
Without internet.

362
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:45,001
Rascal.

363
00:33:45,042 --> 00:33:46,459
But how will I contact you?

364
00:33:53,501 --> 00:33:54,501
Busy?

365
00:33:56,459 --> 00:33:57,459
A lot.

366
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:00,584
Fine.

367
00:34:01,001 --> 00:34:02,959
Then I won't take
much of your time.

368
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,667
Look, as soon as
I write your scenes..

369
00:34:07,626 --> 00:34:08,751
..I'll keep giving it to you.

370
00:34:08,876 --> 00:34:10,209
What problem do you have with me?

371
00:34:10,292 --> 00:34:11,501
I don't have a problem with you.

372
00:34:12,334 --> 00:34:14,126
But the fact is you're
wrong for this film.

373
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:16,042
I can't believe you just said that.

374
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:21,792
Because I feel I am a
complete misfit for this role.

375
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:28,417
But I didn't think anyone
had the guts to say that to me.

376
00:34:30,209 --> 00:34:31,417
My mother always says.

377
00:34:32,209 --> 00:34:33,792
That I always speak the truth.

378
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:37,751
It's all her fault.

379
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:41,376
She shouldn't have named you Satya.

380
00:34:42,126 --> 00:34:43,542
I tell her the same thing.

381
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:46,917
Well, at least
we agree on something.

382
00:34:48,751 --> 00:34:49,751
Yes.

383
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:51,167
Friends?

384
00:34:54,501 --> 00:34:55,501
Friends?

385
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:57,167
Shall we go down?

386
00:34:57,626 --> 00:34:58,751
Everyone's waiting.

387
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:00,292
And then Monali sees the witch.

388
00:35:00,376 --> 00:35:03,042
Hey, leave the witch,
where is the heroine? - Sir.

389
00:35:03,792 --> 00:35:04,959
Yes. Yes.

390
00:35:14,876 --> 00:35:16,876
Because I have met Ragini.

391
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:20,751
That's why I feel that at that time
I will feel a bit disappointed.

392
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:23,376
Yes, when I had met her..

393
00:35:23,459 --> 00:35:25,751
Her face had a different expression.

394
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:29,459
So I wish to bring that
expression in my acting.

395
00:35:29,626 --> 00:35:30,626
What do you think?

396
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:32,167
It's so worst.

397
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:34,917
Look at your face.

398
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:37,334
It's sulking.

399
00:35:37,584 --> 00:35:39,376
As if you've missed
one of my big episodes.

400
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:41,542
What can this writer do?

401
00:35:41,751 --> 00:35:44,251
I'll go straight to Rocks, best.

402
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:48,876
All your actors either
go to directors or writers?

403
00:35:49,251 --> 00:35:50,417
What about us actors?

404
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:51,792
Excuse me.

405
00:35:51,876 --> 00:35:54,667
As you know I've 2 BF's
in Lokhandwala back-lane.

406
00:35:55,334 --> 00:35:57,751
I will compromise
only for Rocks sir.

407
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:02,584
That Tanya,
Ashish Kapoor's daughter.

408
00:36:02,667 --> 00:36:04,626
You can stop dreaming about her.

409
00:36:05,251 --> 00:36:07,167
Settle with her. Gina.

410
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,917
Who knows where she's got a tattoo.

411
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:14,626
She's already got so many holes,
I am already confused

412
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:07,709
Patwardhan Villa.
Dahanu, Maharashtra.

413
00:37:08,334 --> 00:37:09,959
Built in 1920.

414
00:37:12,334 --> 00:37:14,959
One of India's haunted houses.

415
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:20,876
The locals say they
often feel a presence here..

416
00:37:21,626 --> 00:37:25,334
..as if the house doesn't
want anyone to enter inside.

417
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:28,959
Many deaths have been reported here
in the last 100 years.

418
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:33,959
The last reported incident
was Ragini and Uday.

419
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:40,876
Infact A.S.I have put a
board outside this house.

420
00:37:41,334 --> 00:37:43,959
That after sunset
and before sunrise..

421
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:46,084
..no admission inside.

422
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:49,126
What could have happened here?

423
00:37:50,376 --> 00:37:52,834
Patwardhan, spice merchant.

424
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:56,834
100 years ago,
he was India's leading chili trader.

425
00:37:57,126 --> 00:38:00,084
He had got this bungalow
made for his family.

426
00:38:01,084 --> 00:38:02,501
Who...is this woman?

427
00:38:02,876 --> 00:38:06,501
And why has her face
been cut out in every picture?

428
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:08,876
Is she Patwardhan's wife?

429
00:38:09,709 --> 00:38:10,709
Oh my, God!

430
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,459
That means children were sacrificed?

431
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:27,334
Come in.

432
00:38:28,084 --> 00:38:29,084
Listen.

433
00:38:29,834 --> 00:38:31,667
Excuse me, sorry. Not today please.

434
00:38:31,751 --> 00:38:33,501
I've already taken my eye-lash off.

435
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:36,626
So? - So I cannot hookup with you.

436
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:38,834
Crazy woman,
my lighter's not working.

437
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:40,292
I came here for that.

438
00:38:40,376 --> 00:38:42,792
As if I am the only one in this house
that has a lighter?

439
00:38:42,876 --> 00:38:43,876
Will you?

440
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:46,542
Such a bore?
Take it.

441
00:38:51,751 --> 00:38:54,376
Give me one.

442
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:57,542
Now you're asking for a drag.
Next you'll ask for something else.

443
00:38:58,209 --> 00:39:01,042
Don't mind,
but I don't want anything from you.

444
00:39:01,084 --> 00:39:02,084
Thanks.

445
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:04,834
That's what all the
girls say in the beginning.

446
00:39:09,501 --> 00:39:11,542
Did you hear? - Yes, your blabber.

447
00:39:11,626 --> 00:39:14,084
Turn around.

448
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:16,917
Someone just passed by here.

449
00:39:17,376 --> 00:39:18,751
There's someone behind you.

450
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:20,917
Yes, you're behind
me since we came here.

451
00:39:21,084 --> 00:39:22,417
First you were crazy.

452
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:23,542
Now get lost from here.

453
00:39:23,584 --> 00:39:26,876
Now get out.

454
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:28,626
Please, look behind.

455
00:39:29,209 --> 00:39:30,751
I saw someone.

456
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:35,667
Who is it?

457
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:37,084
There's no one.

458
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:38,251
So duffer.

459
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,001
If you build muscles
it doesn't make you a macho man.

460
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:42,959
Coward.
Get out of here.

461
00:39:43,084 --> 00:39:45,126
You've been blabbering nonsense.

462
00:39:45,334 --> 00:39:46,792
I felt like someone..

463
00:39:47,292 --> 00:39:49,626
Okay, please.
Coward, get out from here.

464
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:51,459
Come on, get out.

465
00:39:51,626 --> 00:39:52,501
So bad.

466
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:54,876
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!

467
00:39:55,251 --> 00:39:56,251
Hey!

468
00:39:56,459 --> 00:39:57,792
Are you mad?

469
00:39:58,334 --> 00:39:59,709
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!

470
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:35,459
This is my room.
- I didn't say this is my room.

471
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:37,667
What?

472
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,292
Two minutes.

473
00:41:44,292 --> 00:41:45,751
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

474
00:41:48,459 --> 00:41:49,459
What is it?

475
00:41:50,334 --> 00:41:51,334
Who died?

476
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:52,501
Stupid.

477
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:56,001
What do you want?

478
00:41:57,626 --> 00:41:59,792
Listen. - What?

479
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:01,001
Take this.

480
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:02,626
This is tomorrow's call sheet.

481
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:04,959
You weren't answering
your phone so we freaked out.

482
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:07,126
Were you busy?

483
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:08,792
Maybe.
What do you care?

484
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:09,876
Now run along.

485
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:20,667
Sunny.

486
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:22,667
You here?

487
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:23,834
Yes, why?

488
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:25,501
Then.. wait.

489
00:42:29,626 --> 00:42:31,042
Oh no..

490
00:42:32,876 --> 00:42:34,917
What..

491
00:42:36,084 --> 00:42:39,792
How did you get out of
the shower so quickly and..

492
00:42:39,834 --> 00:42:41,042
Excuse me!

493
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:45,001
What's this? I asked you
to wait for me in the shower.

494
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:47,876
Are you freaking mad?
I was in your bathroom?

495
00:42:48,126 --> 00:42:50,834
Do you think I am gay
to make out with myself?

496
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:53,042
Only you can answer that, Maddy.

497
00:42:53,459 --> 00:42:55,042
Why are you feeling shy? - Listen.

498
00:42:55,209 --> 00:42:57,626
There's a limit to pranks.
Enough of this charade.

499
00:42:57,917 --> 00:42:58,834
Hello.

500
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,751
I am not a cheap man.

501
00:43:01,001 --> 00:43:03,084
I still get 600
friend request daily.

502
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:04,542
Nonsense..

503
00:43:04,584 --> 00:43:05,876
She was with me in the shower.

504
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:08,167
Why don't you tell everyone..
that you were with me in the shower?

505
00:43:08,251 --> 00:43:09,251
Bloody pervert.

506
00:43:09,459 --> 00:43:11,709
What..

507
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:15,667
Dude.

508
00:43:16,084 --> 00:43:17,709
Was Sunny really with you?

509
00:43:17,876 --> 00:43:20,084
I swear I never lie.

510
00:43:37,792 --> 00:43:38,792
Hello.

511
00:43:40,001 --> 00:43:44,459
Rascal, you sent
mind-blowing stuff.

512
00:43:44,584 --> 00:43:46,501
Send few grams more.

513
00:43:46,834 --> 00:43:47,917
Okay.

514
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,292
Thanks.

515
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:57,584
Next time I'll imagine
Katrina or Kareena.

516
00:43:58,334 --> 00:43:59,084
Or Vidya.

517
00:43:59,126 --> 00:44:01,042
But 25-30 kilos less.

518
00:44:01,417 --> 00:44:02,917
Oh Vidya.

519
00:44:05,084 --> 00:44:11,376
"Ragini"

520
00:48:12,751 --> 00:48:13,834
Sound.

521
00:48:14,251 --> 00:48:15,042
Roll camera.

522
00:48:15,084 --> 00:48:16,084
Rolling.

523
00:48:16,334 --> 00:48:17,334
Take 15.

524
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:21,042
And action.

525
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:22,376
Uday.

526
00:48:22,459 --> 00:48:23,709
Uday, where are you?

527
00:48:24,626 --> 00:48:25,626
Save me.

528
00:48:26,626 --> 00:48:27,626
Save..

529
00:48:28,584 --> 00:48:29,917
Cut. Cut. Cut.

530
00:48:30,584 --> 00:48:31,584
Cut it!

531
00:48:32,126 --> 00:48:33,542
Someone give her, her lines.

532
00:48:37,792 --> 00:48:38,792
Rocks.

533
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:42,667
Can I just take five?

534
00:48:43,542 --> 00:48:45,167
Take ten, babiness.

535
00:48:48,209 --> 00:48:49,334
Someone bring tea.

536
00:49:45,667 --> 00:49:47,751
If she takes five
after every break..

537
00:49:47,792 --> 00:49:49,042
..then we'll be in trouble.

538
00:49:49,959 --> 00:49:51,834
Experience, sir.
Experience.

539
00:49:51,959 --> 00:49:53,667
You see,
my experience in television..

540
00:49:53,709 --> 00:49:54,917
..comes so much in handy.

541
00:49:55,001 --> 00:49:56,501
I see.
- There are so many shots.

542
00:49:56,584 --> 00:49:58,334
Reaction shots.
Expressions.

543
00:49:58,501 --> 00:50:00,042
There are so many
expressions on my face.

544
00:50:00,126 --> 00:50:01,292
I'm filled with talent.

545
00:50:01,542 --> 00:50:03,209
Would you like to see it?
Would you like to see it?

546
00:50:04,709 --> 00:50:05,709
Romance.

547
00:50:07,084 --> 00:50:07,751
Cut.

548
00:50:07,792 --> 00:50:08,792
Intense.

549
00:50:10,626 --> 00:50:11,417
Cut.

550
00:50:11,459 --> 00:50:12,459
Revenge.

551
00:50:14,001 --> 00:50:14,917
Cut.

552
00:50:14,959 --> 00:50:16,167
The joy of becoming a father.

553
00:50:17,709 --> 00:50:18,584
Cut.

554
00:50:18,626 --> 00:50:19,626
Mother's death.

555
00:50:21,376 --> 00:50:22,292
Cut.

556
00:50:22,334 --> 00:50:23,334
That's talent, sir.

557
00:50:23,709 --> 00:50:25,417
Experience.
That's where you get it from.

558
00:50:25,501 --> 00:50:27,334
She has experience too.

559
00:50:27,376 --> 00:50:31,334
Sir, only from adult movies.

560
00:50:32,126 --> 00:50:33,876
These things don't teach you acting.

561
00:50:34,126 --> 00:50:36,459
Doing an emotional scene means
pushing to the limit.

562
00:50:39,751 --> 00:50:40,501
Sunny.

563
00:50:40,501 --> 00:50:41,501
Maddy.

564
00:50:42,876 --> 00:50:45,376
Imagine there's no one here.

565
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,001
No cameras.

566
00:50:48,126 --> 00:50:50,501
Just you.

567
00:50:51,834 --> 00:50:56,834
And your efforts finally succeed.

568
00:50:56,917 --> 00:50:57,917
What?

569
00:50:58,001 --> 00:50:59,459
I come close to you.

570
00:50:59,834 --> 00:51:01,542
Take off my clothes.

571
00:51:02,417 --> 00:51:04,542
Then take off your clothes and..

572
00:51:05,334 --> 00:51:10,251
..pull your hair, and kiss you.

573
00:51:12,334 --> 00:51:14,126
And what will you do now?

574
00:51:14,959 --> 00:51:18,417
Now do it with feelings.

575
00:51:19,459 --> 00:51:21,792
I'll give you the clue.

576
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:28,709
Maddy.

577
00:51:50,709 --> 00:51:52,167
Oh, Maddy.

578
00:51:56,084 --> 00:51:57,167
Oh, yeah!

579
00:51:57,834 --> 00:51:58,834
Oh, Maddy.

580
00:51:59,709 --> 00:52:02,209
Oh, yeah!

581
00:52:02,542 --> 00:52:04,167
Oh, Maddy.

582
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:07,292
Oh, Maddy.

583
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:09,417
Oh, Maddy.

584
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:12,709
Oh, yeah!

585
00:52:13,542 --> 00:52:14,542
Oh, Maddy.

586
00:52:19,042 --> 00:52:20,167
What happened, Maddy?

587
00:52:21,334 --> 00:52:25,334
I admit that adult films
don't make you an actor.

588
00:52:26,167 --> 00:52:28,459
But you couldn't
do that much either.

589
00:52:36,917 --> 00:52:39,792
When the blood rushes
back to your brains..

590
00:52:40,584 --> 00:52:42,501
..then answer me.

591
00:52:43,667 --> 00:52:45,001
One more.

592
00:52:45,459 --> 00:52:46,626
Keep that mood on.

593
00:52:46,959 --> 00:52:47,501
Let's do it.

594
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:49,876
I mean let's go for take.

595
00:52:54,084 --> 00:52:55,542
I think you did the right thing.

596
00:52:56,167 --> 00:52:58,001
Such people don't understand
any other language.

597
00:52:58,126 --> 00:53:00,792
So you're telling me that all the men
on this unit think I am a w***e.

598
00:53:00,917 --> 00:53:01,917
Not all men.

599
00:53:02,292 --> 00:53:04,126
Only those whose brains
are in their pants.

600
00:53:05,626 --> 00:53:07,042
So all men.

601
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:09,834
No. Not all men.

602
00:53:14,751 --> 00:53:15,751
I am sorry.

603
00:53:16,251 --> 00:53:17,501
It's not my mistake.

604
00:53:18,417 --> 00:53:21,042
I don't know what's wrong with me.

605
00:53:21,917 --> 00:53:24,876
Since I came here I feel strange.

606
00:53:25,459 --> 00:53:26,459
Come with me.

607
00:53:30,417 --> 00:53:31,542
Why do you feel strange?

608
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,334
Are you fine?

609
00:53:34,542 --> 00:53:35,834
I don't know. I mean.

610
00:53:36,167 --> 00:53:37,584
Headache and..

611
00:53:37,792 --> 00:53:38,792
Sunny.

612
00:53:39,001 --> 00:53:40,501
Shall I do your touchup?

613
00:53:41,709 --> 00:53:42,584
Just five more minutes.

614
00:53:42,626 --> 00:53:43,376
Okay.

615
00:53:43,417 --> 00:53:44,417
What happened?

616
00:53:47,501 --> 00:53:48,501
Nothing.

617
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:50,667
Remember one thing.

618
00:53:51,626 --> 00:53:54,417
No matter what happens,
I won't let anything happen to you.

619
00:53:55,667 --> 00:53:56,667
Okay.

620
00:53:59,584 --> 00:54:00,834
Satya. - Yes.

621
00:54:01,792 --> 00:54:06,376
You were right,
not all men are alike.

622
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,709
Don't want too many lights, got it?

623
00:54:16,792 --> 00:54:17,792
Let's go

624
00:54:23,751 --> 00:54:25,584
Hello, babiness.

625
00:54:26,167 --> 00:54:27,167
Hi.

626
00:54:30,251 --> 00:54:31,001
Come.

627
00:54:31,042 --> 00:54:32,042
Excuse me.

628
00:54:32,084 --> 00:54:35,209
I mean come, sit. Sit.

629
00:54:35,667 --> 00:54:36,292
Come.

630
00:54:36,334 --> 00:54:37,834
Rocks! Rocks!

631
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:40,209
Why don't you show me the monitor?

632
00:54:40,376 --> 00:54:42,959
I love the director's angle.

633
00:54:43,334 --> 00:54:44,334
Yes.

634
00:54:44,501 --> 00:54:45,709
What will I do now?

635
00:54:46,334 --> 00:54:48,792
We will hang you upside down.

636
00:54:48,876 --> 00:54:53,417
And you've to pretend
as if you saw a witch.

637
00:54:53,626 --> 00:54:54,501
Okay?

638
00:54:54,542 --> 00:54:55,834
Did you rehearse your lines?

639
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,834
Help! Help!

640
00:54:59,126 --> 00:55:01,209
I've been practicing it since
I was a kid. - Yeah, very good.

641
00:55:01,417 --> 00:55:03,584
Come on. Hang her upside down.

642
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:05,834
Come, come, please.

643
00:55:06,042 --> 00:55:07,042
Please sit.

644
00:55:07,542 --> 00:55:08,542
Come.

645
00:55:15,501 --> 00:55:16,417
Okay, ready.

646
00:55:16,459 --> 00:55:18,584
Stunt boys, lift her.

647
00:55:20,459 --> 00:55:22,667
Save me! Save me!

648
00:55:22,709 --> 00:55:25,251
Okay, turn her upside down.

649
00:55:25,334 --> 00:55:28,417
Save me. Help!

650
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:30,667
Everyone ready?

651
00:55:31,417 --> 00:55:33,251
Okay, roll sound. - Rolling.

652
00:55:33,376 --> 00:55:35,251
Camera. - Rolling.

653
00:55:35,542 --> 00:55:36,542
Take one.

654
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:37,917
Action.

655
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:42,209
Help! Help! Help!

656
00:55:42,584 --> 00:55:46,167
Help! Help!

657
00:55:46,792 --> 00:55:48,501
Help!

658
00:55:49,001 --> 00:55:50,126
Very good, very good.

659
00:55:50,376 --> 00:55:51,709
What a performance.

660
00:55:52,209 --> 00:55:56,792
Very good, scream some more. - Help!

661
00:55:57,084 --> 00:55:58,876
Help!

662
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:26,292
Scream some more. - Save me.

663
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:29,542
Bring me down - Come on.

664
00:56:30,459 --> 00:56:33,251
Cut it.
Bring her down!

665
00:56:38,876 --> 00:56:40,542
Monali. Monali. - What happened?

666
00:56:40,876 --> 00:56:42,667
Two girls.

667
00:56:42,876 --> 00:56:43,876
Whose two girls?

668
00:56:46,126 --> 00:56:46,834
What are you saying?

669
00:56:46,876 --> 00:56:48,501
Brilliant performance, Monali.

670
00:56:48,959 --> 00:56:49,751
Brilliant.

671
00:56:49,792 --> 00:56:51,459
What an improvisation.

672
00:56:51,501 --> 00:56:53,459
You were in the character.

673
00:56:53,542 --> 00:56:56,876
Wow! I really enjoyed that.

674
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:58,667
Clap. Clap.

675
00:56:59,042 --> 00:57:00,709
What a performance.

676
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:02,626
Very good.
Very good.

677
00:57:03,126 --> 00:57:04,584
Amazing, very good.

678
00:57:07,876 --> 00:57:09,084
Enough, shut up.

679
00:57:09,792 --> 00:57:10,792
Pack up.

680
00:57:16,792 --> 00:57:18,042
Come on, guys, move it.

681
00:57:18,126 --> 00:57:19,542
Push, push.

682
00:57:19,626 --> 00:57:20,834
Come on. - Hurry up.

683
00:57:21,334 --> 00:57:23,251
We've to get out of
here before nightfall.

684
00:57:23,334 --> 00:57:24,667
What if it's a night shoot?

685
00:57:25,042 --> 00:57:26,251
We'll see then.

686
00:57:27,209 --> 00:57:30,167
We don't want to spend the
night with ghosts and witches.

687
00:57:52,334 --> 00:57:55,959
You know,
when Rocks came to meet me first..

688
00:57:56,834 --> 00:58:01,042
..he said he's a
big fan of my acting.

689
00:58:03,251 --> 00:58:04,501
What did he say to you?

690
00:58:06,876 --> 00:58:08,501
That he loves my books.

691
00:58:09,792 --> 00:58:11,501
And you believed him?

692
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:16,917
Basically, he knew that..

693
00:58:17,001 --> 00:58:22,167
..you're the right person
to write Ragini's story.

694
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:24,542
I knew that.

695
00:58:25,626 --> 00:58:27,042
He never reads any of my books.

696
00:58:27,251 --> 00:58:28,501
Of course he doesn't.

697
00:58:29,001 --> 00:58:31,876
Pandey never even reads his messages.

698
00:58:42,292 --> 00:58:44,667
Are you going to waste
more time on Rocks?

699
00:58:46,251 --> 00:58:48,126
I am thinking about Monali,
not Rocks.

700
00:58:49,667 --> 00:58:51,042
About what happened on the sets?

701
00:58:51,376 --> 00:58:54,042
What if Monali really
saw something on the ceiling?

702
00:58:55,209 --> 00:58:57,209
Monali is a drama queen.

703
00:58:57,376 --> 00:58:59,584
She can do anything for attention.

704
00:59:00,126 --> 00:59:01,959
There are no ghosts here.

705
00:59:03,084 --> 00:59:05,459
Ragini's mother doesn't
think that. - What?

706
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:08,417
Ragini's mother believes
there's something in this house.

707
00:59:09,876 --> 00:59:12,376
And I should stay
away from this house.

708
00:59:12,626 --> 00:59:14,501
Yet I brought Rocks here.

709
00:59:15,792 --> 00:59:19,292
Now I feel I put
everyone's life in danger..

710
00:59:19,542 --> 00:59:21,042
..for the sake of my career.

711
00:59:21,709 --> 00:59:23,126
Satya, don't be silly.

712
00:59:23,542 --> 00:59:26,417
We're all here for our careers.

713
00:59:27,209 --> 00:59:28,209
Not for you.

714
00:59:29,376 --> 00:59:31,626
If anything happens to anyone..

715
00:59:32,792 --> 00:59:34,334
..then I will never forgive myself.

716
00:59:34,792 --> 00:59:35,792
I don't know about others..

717
00:59:35,876 --> 00:59:37,292
..but something will
definitely happen to you.

718
00:59:37,626 --> 00:59:40,167
If you keep drinking
whiskey at this rate.

719
00:59:40,542 --> 00:59:43,917
Then tomorrow you'll
feel hammers in your head.

720
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:45,834
Are you stopping
me from drinking? - No.

721
00:59:45,917 --> 00:59:48,042
I am stopping you
from drinking alone.

722
00:59:53,501 --> 00:59:54,501
Careful, madam.

723
00:59:55,417 --> 00:59:58,126
After two drinks, even
boys like me look handsome.

724
01:00:45,042 --> 01:00:49,209
"I've surrendered myself to you."

725
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:53,042
"I am yours, only yours."

726
01:00:54,417 --> 01:01:02,709
"My days are restless,
I spend it tossing around."

727
01:01:03,209 --> 01:01:07,001
"I want to spend
the night in your arms."

728
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:11,626
"My heart speaks to yours."

729
01:01:12,501 --> 01:01:16,376
"I want to spend
the night in your arms."

730
01:01:16,751 --> 01:01:22,334
"Come dwell in me."

731
01:01:45,167 --> 01:01:54,126
"When you touched..I came alive."

732
01:01:54,459 --> 01:02:03,459
"My desires..found a voice."

733
01:02:03,876 --> 01:02:12,709
"When you touched..I came alive."

734
01:02:13,126 --> 01:02:21,917
"My desires..found a voice."

735
01:02:22,417 --> 01:02:26,126
"I want to spend
the night in your arms."

736
01:02:27,084 --> 01:02:30,751
"My heart speaks to yours."

737
01:02:31,709 --> 01:02:36,084
"I want to spend
the night in your arms."

738
01:02:36,376 --> 01:02:42,167
"Come dwell in me."

739
01:03:20,042 --> 01:03:21,126
It stopped raining.

740
01:03:22,751 --> 01:03:23,751
Shall we go?

741
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:26,501
Yes.

742
01:03:53,709 --> 01:03:54,709
Oh my god.

743
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:58,209
That's strange.

744
01:04:00,126 --> 01:04:01,667
The entire family died.

745
01:04:03,251 --> 01:04:06,542
But Patwardhan only gave the names
of his kids in the obituary.

746
01:04:09,792 --> 01:04:10,792
That's weird.

747
01:04:12,667 --> 01:04:14,084
What about their mother?

748
01:04:14,667 --> 01:04:15,667
Coffee.

749
01:04:16,084 --> 01:04:18,751
Finally. Here comes
my great assistant, Nishant.

750
01:04:19,001 --> 01:04:20,167
Yeah. - Where were you?

751
01:04:20,959 --> 01:04:22,376
Getting coffee beans from Brazil?

752
01:04:22,501 --> 01:04:23,876
What difference does it make?

753
01:04:24,209 --> 01:04:25,959
Even if I had come any later..

754
01:04:26,042 --> 01:04:27,542
..you would've still been here.

755
01:04:27,626 --> 01:04:28,917
Just stuck to your seats.

756
01:04:29,084 --> 01:04:31,792
I don't understand how
you work so extensively.

757
01:04:31,959 --> 01:04:33,334
And you're so busy.

758
01:04:33,584 --> 01:04:35,876
Yet you find time
for these free cases.

759
01:04:36,167 --> 01:04:37,667
I mean what's the idea here, boss?

760
01:04:37,917 --> 01:04:38,917
I am on to something.

761
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,667
Dr. D, ghosts, spirits,
witches, haunted house rumours.

762
01:04:41,876 --> 01:04:43,876
..have been spread by them.

763
01:04:43,959 --> 01:04:46,501
It's the job of Rock's PR machinery.

764
01:04:46,751 --> 01:04:48,334
You know what the
problem with you guys is.

765
01:04:48,459 --> 01:04:49,542
You are too cynical.

766
01:04:50,209 --> 01:04:53,459
Anyway, where's the footage
from Ragini's mental asylum.

767
01:04:54,126 --> 01:04:55,084
I saw it.

768
01:04:55,126 --> 01:04:56,126
I'll show it to you.

769
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:57,376
Careful.

770
01:04:57,417 --> 01:04:59,251
Ragini's sitting
on her bed like this.

771
01:04:59,501 --> 01:05:01,709
And there are no
expressions on her face.

772
01:05:01,876 --> 01:05:05,501
And she's just rocking
front and back.

773
01:05:05,584 --> 01:05:07,001
For freaking two years.

774
01:05:07,209 --> 01:05:08,876
I mean I died of boredom.

775
01:05:10,084 --> 01:05:11,792
I am so glad you liked it.

776
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:13,501
I need the tapes
on my table tomorrow.

777
01:05:13,626 --> 01:05:15,251
But listen to.. - Tomorrow.

778
01:05:15,667 --> 01:05:17,751
But listen.. - Yes.

779
01:05:19,542 --> 01:05:24,042
"Ragini"

780
01:05:48,542 --> 01:05:49,542
Who is it?

781
01:07:08,876 --> 01:07:10,626
No please mother.

782
01:07:11,751 --> 01:07:14,001
I'm not a witch.

783
01:08:04,376 --> 01:08:05,376
My back hurts.

784
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:42,792
Sunny.

785
01:08:43,417 --> 01:08:44,917
I've been looking all over for you.

786
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:47,501
What are you doing here?

787
01:08:54,584 --> 01:08:57,501
What am I doing here?

788
01:08:57,751 --> 01:08:59,251
What do you mean?

789
01:08:59,334 --> 01:09:01,126
I hope you haven't
started sleep-walking?

790
01:09:01,626 --> 01:09:02,626
Don't do that.

791
01:09:03,042 --> 01:09:05,501
You'll find the entire
crew walking behind you.

792
01:09:06,501 --> 01:09:08,042
Come on.
Get some rest.

793
01:09:08,126 --> 01:09:09,459
And shoot? - Shoot?

794
01:09:10,292 --> 01:09:11,542
Today's a night-shift.

795
01:09:11,959 --> 01:09:13,626
Today is Rock's special moon night.

796
01:09:15,501 --> 01:09:16,501
Come on.

797
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:51,751
Dr. D, I think my
life is passing me by.

798
01:09:52,001 --> 01:09:53,959
I told you a thousand times
there's nothing in that video.

799
01:09:54,042 --> 01:09:55,501
There's nothing, nothing, nothing.

800
01:09:56,209 --> 01:09:58,917
And I said until we
don't see all the videos..

801
01:09:59,001 --> 01:10:00,709
..we won't move from here.

802
01:10:00,834 --> 01:10:02,417
Neither you nor me.

803
01:10:02,959 --> 01:10:03,959
Shut up.

804
01:10:05,084 --> 01:10:06,084
Great.

805
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:13,501
"Ragini"

806
01:10:25,792 --> 01:10:28,251
You lost.

807
01:10:40,501 --> 01:10:44,376
Satya, why are you so grumpy?

808
01:10:44,626 --> 01:10:46,209
Come down, we're all having fun.

809
01:10:46,292 --> 01:10:47,876
Come on.

810
01:10:48,292 --> 01:10:49,292
Come on.

811
01:10:51,917 --> 01:10:54,501
Rocks is cheating and
getting all our secrets out.

812
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:56,709
You know Tanya and Kunal
are having an affair..

813
01:10:56,751 --> 01:10:58,251
..since the past two months.

814
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:03,584
Listen, please don't
tell anyone about this.

815
01:11:03,834 --> 01:11:05,084
Don't we have anything else to do?

816
01:11:05,167 --> 01:11:07,751
We aren't going to make
a status update about your affair.

817
01:11:07,792 --> 01:11:08,792
Yes.

818
01:11:10,001 --> 01:11:11,542
Satya, wait, wait.

819
01:11:11,876 --> 01:11:13,251
It's an amazing game.
Amazing.

820
01:11:13,334 --> 01:11:14,167
I tell you..

821
01:11:14,209 --> 01:11:15,626
The game's called 'Never-Ever'.

822
01:11:15,792 --> 01:11:17,042
I have Never-Ever'.

823
01:11:17,209 --> 01:11:17,834
Okay.

824
01:11:17,876 --> 01:11:20,876
So anyone of us will start
a sentence with 'never ever'.

825
01:11:21,459 --> 01:11:25,459
And if you've done it,
then your drink..bottoms up.

826
01:11:25,542 --> 01:11:26,542
Get it?

827
01:11:26,709 --> 01:11:27,917
It's simple.

828
01:11:28,001 --> 01:11:29,584
Like I..I will say..

829
01:11:29,751 --> 01:11:30,417
Yes.

830
01:11:30,459 --> 01:11:33,042
I have never ever
done in an airplane.

831
01:11:33,334 --> 01:11:36,167
So if you've done it in
the airplane, then your drink.

832
01:11:39,376 --> 01:11:40,542
That's it. Right.

833
01:11:41,751 --> 01:11:42,751
Come on.

834
01:11:43,417 --> 01:11:44,584
No one's forcing him.

835
01:11:47,709 --> 01:11:48,709
Come on.

836
01:11:54,501 --> 01:11:55,459
Come on.

837
01:11:55,501 --> 01:11:56,709
There you go, sir.

838
01:11:57,209 --> 01:11:57,917
Ready?

839
01:11:57,959 --> 01:11:59,209
Everyone, ready.

840
01:11:59,292 --> 01:12:00,834
Satya, your turn. Your turn.

841
01:12:05,501 --> 01:12:07,167
I have never ever played this game.

842
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:20,709
What's the connection
with their clothes?

843
01:12:21,084 --> 01:12:21,959
Punishment.

844
01:12:22,001 --> 01:12:23,959
If you don't take sip
in a 'never-ever' turn..

845
01:12:24,167 --> 01:12:25,501
..then you're punished.

846
01:12:25,751 --> 01:12:27,834
All and all it's a drinking game.

847
01:12:27,917 --> 01:12:29,959
If someone doesn't
sip in your round..

848
01:12:30,042 --> 01:12:31,542
..then you can punish him.

849
01:12:38,501 --> 01:12:39,709
What happened, babiness?

850
01:12:40,501 --> 01:12:41,709
Where are you lost?

851
01:12:42,084 --> 01:12:46,167
I am just waiting
for my life to leave me.

852
01:12:51,042 --> 01:12:52,542
Why did I just say that?

853
01:12:54,834 --> 01:12:56,042
Now my turn, please.

854
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:57,667
Now come on you say..

855
01:12:57,876 --> 01:13:01,584
I have never ever,
ever killed anyone.

856
01:13:01,792 --> 01:13:02,792
Kill what?

857
01:13:02,959 --> 01:13:04,501
Are you crazy?

858
01:13:09,501 --> 01:13:10,667
What is the problem?

859
01:13:27,709 --> 01:13:29,167
I got this, guys. Got this.

860
01:13:30,334 --> 01:13:32,626
Sunny took a sip
because everyone says..

861
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:36,751
..that she can kill with her looks.

862
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:42,834
Kill-bill.

863
01:13:42,917 --> 01:13:44,501
Rocks is so funny, right.

864
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:50,001
Monali, you said this only
for getting punished, right?

865
01:13:50,667 --> 01:13:51,751
Come on, guys.

866
01:13:51,834 --> 01:13:55,417
A big punishment for Monali.
- I told you.

867
01:13:55,501 --> 01:13:58,251
Oh no. Now I'll have
to take my dress off, right?

868
01:13:58,334 --> 01:13:59,334
Come on.

869
01:13:59,417 --> 01:14:01,376
No, no, no, wait.

870
01:14:01,542 --> 01:14:04,167
What's your problem? Don't worry.

871
01:14:04,501 --> 01:14:06,167
Take it off. - No, no, sir.

872
01:14:07,084 --> 01:14:09,792
We said..you'll get a punishment.

873
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:12,292
We haven't said which punishment.

874
01:14:13,001 --> 01:14:14,876
Your punishment is.. - Hold on.

875
01:14:14,959 --> 01:14:17,334
Hold on. Hold on.

876
01:14:18,209 --> 01:14:21,667
I will decide Monali's punishment.

877
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:25,209
And Monali's punishment will be..

878
01:14:25,376 --> 01:14:30,084
..that she will
have to kiss someone.

879
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:33,709
And who?

880
01:14:35,792 --> 01:14:36,792
Me..

881
01:14:37,042 --> 01:14:38,417
Let me see.

882
01:14:42,751 --> 01:14:44,042
Sunny.

883
01:14:44,667 --> 01:14:45,959
Me? Why?

884
01:14:46,376 --> 01:14:48,459
You just broke a rule.

885
01:14:48,709 --> 01:14:51,501
You took a sip at I
never ever killed anyone.

886
01:14:51,584 --> 01:14:54,917
Unless you really killed someone.

887
01:14:56,126 --> 01:14:57,542
I haven't yet.

888
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:03,501
But I could kill you
for making me do this.

889
01:15:04,126 --> 01:15:07,292
If you do this.. I am ready to die.

890
01:15:08,126 --> 01:15:09,917
Get ready to die.

891
01:15:11,209 --> 01:15:12,334
Come on kiss me.

892
01:15:12,626 --> 01:15:13,626
Come on.

893
01:16:02,334 --> 01:16:04,376
Cut it or I'll spill it.

894
01:16:06,751 --> 01:16:10,167
That was..awesome.

895
01:16:10,209 --> 01:16:10,751
Wow!

896
01:16:10,792 --> 01:16:12,126
Thank you. - Superb!

897
01:16:16,084 --> 01:16:17,417
Whether she dies or not..

898
01:16:19,334 --> 01:16:21,292
..but I will definitely
die of happiness.

899
01:16:22,959 --> 01:16:25,334
But if I die then who
will s***w all of you.

900
01:16:25,501 --> 01:16:27,167
Come on. Party over.

901
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:28,542
Come on.

902
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,501
Kunal. - Yes, sir.

903
01:16:29,542 --> 01:16:31,167
Why hasn't the unit's
bus arrived yet?

904
01:16:31,251 --> 01:16:32,417
Sir, I've already called thrice.

905
01:16:32,459 --> 01:16:33,501
But they aren't answering.

906
01:16:33,501 --> 01:16:35,126
Then call someone else in the bus.

907
01:16:35,292 --> 01:16:37,376
The moon will be out soon,
we cannot delay.

908
01:16:38,792 --> 01:16:40,042
We shouldn't be late.

909
01:16:42,209 --> 01:16:43,376
She's right. - Yes sir.

910
01:16:43,459 --> 01:16:44,751
Everybody, come on.

911
01:16:44,917 --> 01:16:45,917
Back to work.

912
01:16:46,209 --> 01:16:47,042
Gina. - Yes.

913
01:16:47,084 --> 01:16:50,584
Blood, acts, handcuffs? - Handcuffs.

914
01:16:50,959 --> 01:16:52,626
Oh no, give me five.

915
01:17:08,209 --> 01:17:09,209
Ma'am.

916
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:11,417
Ma'am.

917
01:17:11,584 --> 01:17:14,959
I came to say that I've
to go home early today.

918
01:17:15,751 --> 01:17:17,334
Why do you want to go early?

919
01:17:17,501 --> 01:17:23,001
Didn't I tell you, ma'am?
I am fasting today.

920
01:17:23,292 --> 01:17:26,626
Tonight evil powers are worshiped.

921
01:17:28,376 --> 01:17:29,542
What happened? Scared?

922
01:17:30,334 --> 01:17:32,376
Do you believe in
ghosts and spirits?

923
01:17:32,584 --> 01:17:35,417
Sir, I believe in God..

924
01:17:35,667 --> 01:17:38,209
..so we should believe
in evil powers as well.

925
01:17:38,834 --> 01:17:40,459
Today's a full moon night.

926
01:17:41,084 --> 01:17:46,126
Tonight evil powers
are at their full strength.

927
01:17:46,584 --> 01:17:48,667
That's why we observe
fasts and hold venerations..

928
01:17:48,709 --> 01:17:50,584
..to calm them.

929
01:17:51,084 --> 01:17:53,876
B****t. This is all b****t.

930
01:17:59,001 --> 01:18:04,917
Madam, I think this girl
has been possessed by a witch.

931
01:18:04,959 --> 01:18:07,042
How do you know? - Dr. D.

932
01:18:07,126 --> 01:18:08,917
Please don't start again.

933
01:18:09,126 --> 01:18:10,334
If this goes on, then you two..

934
01:18:10,417 --> 01:18:12,084
..will have to spend the night here.

935
01:18:12,209 --> 01:18:14,584
I don't know about your witch,
but my witch..

936
01:18:14,667 --> 01:18:17,001
I mean my girlfriend
will chew me alive.

937
01:18:17,042 --> 01:18:18,042
Try to understand.

938
01:18:18,126 --> 01:18:21,251
Sir, this is no joke.

939
01:18:22,209 --> 01:18:24,542
Ma'am, there's a saying in sect..

940
01:18:24,626 --> 01:18:28,167
..that a witch posses someone..

941
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:30,792
..when she wants to narrate
her incomplete story.

942
01:18:30,876 --> 01:18:33,001
Oh really. Is it so?

943
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:35,292
So how does she narrate her story?

944
01:18:35,376 --> 01:18:36,667
Backwards.

945
01:18:37,292 --> 01:18:39,542
Whenever she possesses
someone's body..

946
01:18:40,126 --> 01:18:41,459
..she speaks backwards.

947
01:18:41,501 --> 01:18:42,876
She never speaks normally.

948
01:18:44,501 --> 01:18:45,501
Of course.

949
01:18:46,501 --> 01:18:48,792
Get me my food. - Yes, ma'am.

950
01:18:49,417 --> 01:18:51,542
Nishant, you want to go home, right.
- Yes, Dr. D.

951
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:53,042
Go home we'll continue tomorrow.

952
01:18:54,542 --> 01:18:57,667
Dr. D, take some break
from the ghosts. Good night

953
01:19:01,376 --> 01:19:04,334
I'm not a witch, I love my son.

954
01:19:04,834 --> 01:19:07,417
But I just love my son.

955
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:10,292
I'm not a witch,
I'm not killed my daughter.

956
01:19:11,084 --> 01:19:13,167
I don't believe it.
- I'm not a witch.

957
01:19:13,417 --> 01:19:14,709
What did she say?

958
01:19:17,167 --> 01:19:19,542
I like my daughters.

959
01:19:20,084 --> 01:19:23,542
But I just love my son.

960
01:19:24,001 --> 01:19:25,501
I'm not a witch.

961
01:19:35,042 --> 01:19:36,209
I like my daughters.

962
01:19:36,292 --> 01:19:38,417
I like my daughters.

963
01:19:39,126 --> 01:19:41,834
But I just love my son.

964
01:19:42,209 --> 01:19:43,417
I used to fast every Monday.

965
01:19:43,501 --> 01:19:46,126
For five years I fasted every Monday.

966
01:19:46,542 --> 01:19:48,501
After that my son was born.

967
01:19:48,876 --> 01:19:52,084
I will never forget
that inauspicious day.

968
01:19:52,959 --> 01:19:54,876
Their father had gone
out of the city for some work.

969
01:19:54,917 --> 01:19:55,917
Here I come.

970
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:58,501
All three were playing hide-and-seek.

971
01:19:59,084 --> 01:20:03,417
And then suddenly I heard her scream.

972
01:20:03,709 --> 01:20:04,709
Mother!

973
01:20:09,001 --> 01:20:11,459
By the time I came, it was too late..

974
01:20:12,126 --> 01:20:14,126
I was not aware of anything.

975
01:20:14,626 --> 01:20:16,584
I could not understand anything.

976
01:20:17,126 --> 01:20:20,501
I was wondering why
my son is not getting up.

977
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:26,584
For hours, like a crazy person,
I held him in my arms..

978
01:20:26,876 --> 01:20:28,376
..and sang lullabies to him.

979
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:49,626
And then someone gave me some hope.

980
01:20:49,834 --> 01:20:52,542
And your biggest duty is sacrifice.

981
01:20:52,792 --> 01:20:56,876
I had gone so crazy
in the sorrow of my son..

982
01:20:57,251 --> 01:21:00,751
..that I did not even hear
the screams of my daughters.

983
01:21:12,626 --> 01:21:13,626
Hold this.

984
01:21:14,542 --> 01:21:17,334
Shut your eyes and say the chants.

985
01:21:27,001 --> 01:21:28,876
The word spread in the village.

986
01:21:30,334 --> 01:21:32,667
The Tantric ran away from
there at that very moment.

987
01:21:33,876 --> 01:21:37,126
And for the villagers
I became such a mother

988
01:21:37,501 --> 01:21:38,667
..at the hands of which..

989
01:21:38,709 --> 01:21:39,876
She's a witch!

990
01:21:40,042 --> 01:21:42,501
Killed her own daughters.

991
01:21:43,126 --> 01:21:45,501
They hung me from a tree.

992
01:21:45,917 --> 01:21:51,084
I kept screaming..
yes, I have made a very big mistake..

993
01:21:51,959 --> 01:21:53,459
..but I am not a witch.

994
01:21:53,501 --> 01:21:54,876
I've not killed my daughter.

995
01:21:54,959 --> 01:21:58,042
I've not killed my daughter.
- I'm not a witch.

996
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:03,209
No one heard my voice.

997
01:22:05,334 --> 01:22:07,376
Not even their father.

998
01:22:08,959 --> 01:22:11,126
I am just a mother.

999
01:22:12,001 --> 01:22:13,751
Who was sad about her daughters..

1000
01:22:13,834 --> 01:22:15,334
Mother!

1001
01:22:22,084 --> 01:22:25,209
I will not spare anyone.
This is my house.

1002
01:22:26,501 --> 01:22:27,792
I will not spare anyone.

1003
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:28,667
Mother!

1004
01:22:28,709 --> 01:22:29,959
I'm not a witch.

1005
01:22:30,834 --> 01:22:31,876
I'm not a witch.

1006
01:22:31,917 --> 01:22:34,792
This is my house.
I will not go from here.

1007
01:22:34,876 --> 01:22:35,876
Mother!

1008
01:22:36,376 --> 01:22:37,501
Mother!

1009
01:22:42,834 --> 01:22:47,001
Tonight this witch
won't spare anyone.

1010
01:22:48,126 --> 01:22:49,917
She won't spare anyone alive.

1011
01:22:50,667 --> 01:22:52,709
She won't spare anyone.

1012
01:22:54,876 --> 01:22:56,584
I won't let it happen.

1013
01:22:58,126 --> 01:22:59,542
I will have to do something.

1014
01:23:07,584 --> 01:23:08,709
I'll be right back.

1015
01:27:07,209 --> 01:27:09,834
How are all of you?

1016
01:27:41,709 --> 01:27:42,917
Who's under the bed?

1017
01:27:44,584 --> 01:27:46,084
Come out.

1018
01:27:46,584 --> 01:27:47,959
Who's there?

1019
01:27:58,751 --> 01:28:04,459
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!

1020
01:28:06,001 --> 01:28:08,501
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!

1021
01:28:17,126 --> 01:28:20,501
Someone's playing with me.

1022
01:28:24,167 --> 01:28:25,292
Who's there?

1023
01:28:28,209 --> 01:28:29,292
Sunny.

1024
01:28:30,834 --> 01:28:32,834
In the morning you won round 1.

1025
01:28:33,459 --> 01:28:35,209
But I am a specialist in round 2.

1026
01:28:36,209 --> 01:28:37,376
I am coming.

1027
01:28:37,542 --> 01:28:39,501
To have some fun in the jungle.

1028
01:28:39,834 --> 01:28:41,334
Where is it? Where have I kept it?

1029
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:44,292
Today I'll show her real man force.

1030
01:28:45,709 --> 01:28:46,709
Shall we?

1031
01:28:50,501 --> 01:28:52,917
And he had to resign from his post.

1032
01:28:53,084 --> 01:28:54,959
And in the news,
in Rane Mental Asylum today..

1033
01:28:55,042 --> 01:28:57,501
..a death happened in
a strange manner.

1034
01:28:57,751 --> 01:29:00,876
The one who died..
producer and director Rocks..

1035
01:29:00,959 --> 01:29:03,751
..was making a film
based on her life.

1036
01:29:03,959 --> 01:29:05,501
We are talking about that person..

1037
01:29:05,584 --> 01:29:08,209
..whose MMS was leaked
some years back.

1038
01:29:08,501 --> 01:29:11,126
Recently Ragini was
in the news again..

1039
01:29:11,251 --> 01:29:13,292
..when famous film director Rocks..

1040
01:29:13,376 --> 01:29:15,459
..announced a film on her.

1041
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:19,251
But unfortunately,
Ragini can never see this film.

1042
01:29:19,376 --> 01:29:20,792
Along with Ragini's death..

1043
01:29:20,876 --> 01:29:24,334
..her dreadful story is over too.

1044
01:29:27,542 --> 01:29:28,376
Hello.

1045
01:29:28,417 --> 01:29:30,084
Hello, aunty, this is Satya.

1046
01:29:30,667 --> 01:29:32,959
Yes. - Aunty, I am very sorry.

1047
01:29:33,042 --> 01:29:34,667
I don't know what to say.

1048
01:29:35,042 --> 01:29:36,834
No need to say anything, Satya.

1049
01:29:37,584 --> 01:29:39,417
I tried explaining to you.

1050
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:43,542
But no one listened to me.

1051
01:29:44,417 --> 01:29:46,251
Ragini wasn't crazy.

1052
01:29:46,917 --> 01:29:53,751
The truth is...that she
was possessed by a witch.

1053
01:29:55,917 --> 01:29:57,501
Aunty, even if we believe..

1054
01:29:57,751 --> 01:29:59,417
..that Ragini was
possessed by a witch..

1055
01:29:59,751 --> 01:30:00,626
..then where did she go?

1056
01:30:00,667 --> 01:30:04,292
I pray that she went
back to where she came from.

1057
01:30:04,459 --> 01:30:05,459
Aunty...

1058
01:30:08,751 --> 01:30:10,126
Aunty, when did Ragini die?

1059
01:30:10,209 --> 01:30:11,584
Four days ago.

1060
01:30:11,667 --> 01:30:13,917
Four days ago..
- The heroine of your film..

1061
01:30:13,959 --> 01:30:15,709
..came to see my daughter.

1062
01:30:16,126 --> 01:30:17,167
The same day.

1063
01:30:19,084 --> 01:30:20,626
'Since the day I met Ragini..

1064
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:24,209
'There's something in this house.'

1065
01:30:35,501 --> 01:30:37,084
Aunty, the mark on Ragini's arm.

1066
01:30:37,626 --> 01:30:40,959
The mark vanished from her arms too.

1067
01:30:41,501 --> 01:30:46,292
How can a mark vanish
from a person's arm, Satya?

1068
01:30:52,251 --> 01:30:55,501
The mark hasn't vanished,
neither has the witch.

1069
01:31:03,876 --> 01:31:05,084
Hello. - Thank god.

1070
01:31:05,334 --> 01:31:06,251
Hello, Mrs. Shinde.

1071
01:31:06,292 --> 01:31:07,417
Yes Doctor, tell me.

1072
01:31:07,501 --> 01:31:09,167
I want to talk to someone
in that house now.

1073
01:31:09,251 --> 01:31:10,834
I will send Satya's number right now.

1074
01:31:15,251 --> 01:31:16,292
Sunny.

1075
01:31:18,126 --> 01:31:19,167
Sunny.

1076
01:31:19,626 --> 01:31:21,042
Where are you hiding?

1077
01:31:25,626 --> 01:31:26,626
That's..

1078
01:31:34,459 --> 01:31:35,501
Sunny.

1079
01:31:37,001 --> 01:31:38,001
That's..

1080
01:31:42,001 --> 01:31:44,542
Strip-tease with me.

1081
01:31:44,959 --> 01:31:47,584
I am a TV star.

1082
01:31:47,834 --> 01:31:49,501
Whenever I shoot
a wedding night scene..

1083
01:31:49,542 --> 01:31:50,751
..the show gets full TRP.

1084
01:31:51,084 --> 01:31:52,084
Where are you?

1085
01:31:53,042 --> 01:31:57,459
Sunny dear, come to papa.

1086
01:32:09,709 --> 01:32:12,042
Come on..

1087
01:32:12,667 --> 01:32:13,917
Sunny.

1088
01:32:17,667 --> 01:32:18,667
Sunny.

1089
01:32:27,834 --> 01:32:28,834
Sunny.

1090
01:32:29,876 --> 01:32:31,001
Sunny.

1091
01:32:38,084 --> 01:32:39,084
Sunny.

1092
01:32:57,126 --> 01:32:58,126
I..

1093
01:32:59,584 --> 01:33:01,751
Out in the open, in the lake.

1094
01:33:02,542 --> 01:33:03,709
Fine with me.

1095
01:33:04,001 --> 01:33:05,959
Why feel shy from mother nature?

1096
01:33:06,292 --> 01:33:09,167
Sunny Leone, give it to me.

1097
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:11,459
Sunny, I'm coming.

1098
01:33:11,792 --> 01:33:13,417
The water is very cold, no problem.

1099
01:33:13,501 --> 01:33:15,334
Sunny will heat it.
I'm coming.

1100
01:33:16,001 --> 01:33:17,126
Hold my hand.

1101
01:33:17,209 --> 01:33:18,417
Where are you?

1102
01:33:18,501 --> 01:33:20,501
Hey, this donkey has come.

1103
01:33:20,584 --> 01:33:21,584
Sunny.

1104
01:33:36,959 --> 01:33:39,376
I have caught you, come outside.

1105
01:34:13,542 --> 01:34:16,751
The number you're
trying to reach is busy.

1106
01:34:19,167 --> 01:34:20,501
Please call later.

1107
01:34:24,167 --> 01:34:26,209
Hello. - Rocks,
listen to me carefully.

1108
01:34:26,501 --> 01:34:27,501
It's a matter of life and death.

1109
01:34:27,501 --> 01:34:29,501
Whose? Yours or mine?

1110
01:34:30,167 --> 01:34:31,167
It's Sunny.

1111
01:34:31,251 --> 01:34:32,251
She is possessed.

1112
01:34:32,334 --> 01:34:34,001
She's been possessed by a witch.

1113
01:34:34,417 --> 01:34:36,584
And you've gone crazy.

1114
01:34:38,167 --> 01:34:39,167
Rocks.

1115
01:34:39,292 --> 01:34:40,292
Rocks.

1116
01:35:30,126 --> 01:35:35,167
"Ragini"

1117
01:35:42,292 --> 01:35:43,292
Excuse me.

1118
01:35:43,376 --> 01:35:45,417
He said he's my BF
and you believed him.

1119
01:35:46,126 --> 01:35:48,959
You know he was
my neighbour in Delhi.

1120
01:35:49,042 --> 01:35:50,792
That's why we're so
frank with each other.

1121
01:35:50,876 --> 01:35:52,084
So please don't be so jealous.

1122
01:35:52,167 --> 01:35:53,667
You've to choose today.

1123
01:35:53,751 --> 01:35:55,084
Either him or me.

1124
01:35:55,417 --> 01:35:56,709
What choice?

1125
01:35:56,876 --> 01:35:58,959
Please, Manish.
Don't be so jealous.

1126
01:35:59,209 --> 01:36:01,459
I've been a tomboy
since I was a kid.

1127
01:36:01,501 --> 01:36:03,542
So all the boys are
very comfortable with me.

1128
01:36:03,667 --> 01:36:04,459
All boys.

1129
01:36:04,501 --> 01:36:06,876
You've found someone
on the sets as well, right?

1130
01:36:07,459 --> 01:36:08,917
Are you crazy?
Are you mental?

1131
01:36:09,001 --> 01:36:10,709
Monali, it's too much now.

1132
01:36:10,792 --> 01:36:12,584
I know that you..
- Listen to me, okay.

1133
01:36:12,667 --> 01:36:15,251
I need a secured
boyfriend for myself.

1134
01:36:15,292 --> 01:36:16,417
Not insecure ones like you.

1135
01:36:16,501 --> 01:36:17,167
Okay.

1136
01:36:17,209 --> 01:36:20,001
I know you're definitely
up to someone on the sets.

1137
01:36:20,084 --> 01:36:21,042
I know this very well.

1138
01:36:21,084 --> 01:36:24,042
Excuse me, I am not cheating on you.

1139
01:36:24,126 --> 01:36:25,251
Please don't be a fool.

1140
01:36:25,917 --> 01:36:26,709
Oh no!

1141
01:36:26,751 --> 01:36:28,751
You've spoiled my mood.

1142
01:36:28,834 --> 01:36:30,459
Go to hell. - Monali, listen to me.

1143
01:36:31,251 --> 01:36:33,042
All men are like that.

1144
01:36:33,334 --> 01:36:34,376
Worst.

1145
01:36:36,626 --> 01:36:37,626
Rocks!

1146
01:36:42,667 --> 01:36:44,167
Hello, babiness.

1147
01:36:44,751 --> 01:36:48,542
I never told you that
I am your biggest fan.

1148
01:36:48,751 --> 01:36:50,876
In fact, I was just watching..

1149
01:36:50,959 --> 01:36:52,709
..your doctor-nurse
video in my room.

1150
01:36:52,792 --> 01:36:54,667
And then I thought to myself,
"Rocks..

1151
01:36:55,501 --> 01:36:57,167
..you are an idiot".

1152
01:36:57,251 --> 01:37:00,001
You're right here and
I am watching a video.

1153
01:37:00,959 --> 01:37:05,251
And so...I came to say..

1154
01:37:16,542 --> 01:37:18,542
Hello, sweetness.

1155
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:21,501
Feeling shy.

1156
01:37:24,084 --> 01:37:25,334
Don't be shy.

1157
01:37:29,459 --> 01:37:30,584
It's only me.

1158
01:37:55,751 --> 01:37:57,501
I'm not a witch.

1159
01:37:58,542 --> 01:38:00,501
Dirty talking in Marathi.

1160
01:38:01,376 --> 01:38:03,334
But I don't know Marathi.

1161
01:38:04,501 --> 01:38:05,667
Say it in English.

1162
01:38:06,126 --> 01:38:07,292
Say f**k me.

1163
01:38:08,042 --> 01:38:09,042
Say it.

1164
01:38:09,917 --> 01:38:10,917
Say f**k me.

1165
01:38:11,417 --> 01:38:13,042
F**k me!

1166
01:38:17,292 --> 01:38:18,501
But you..

1167
01:38:24,001 --> 01:38:25,876
I think I should drink less vodka.

1168
01:38:26,542 --> 01:38:27,834
What am I doing on you?

1169
01:38:28,459 --> 01:38:29,292
What am I doing?

1170
01:38:29,334 --> 01:38:30,542
What do you mean?

1171
01:38:32,917 --> 01:38:36,292
Look, let's not pretend
with each other anymore.

1172
01:38:36,834 --> 01:38:38,584
No one will ever know..

1173
01:38:39,126 --> 01:38:41,209
..whatever happens
in this room tonight.

1174
01:38:41,542 --> 01:38:43,792
Not even your writer boyfriend.

1175
01:38:43,876 --> 01:38:45,167
Rocks, what are you..

1176
01:38:46,209 --> 01:38:47,584
Now f**k me.

1177
01:38:50,209 --> 01:38:51,209
F**k.

1178
01:38:54,751 --> 01:38:56,834
Rock's voice from Sunny's room.

1179
01:38:58,209 --> 01:38:59,209
Rocks!

1180
01:39:00,376 --> 01:39:02,626
Oh no. What's going on?

1181
01:39:02,834 --> 01:39:04,126
This is bad.

1182
01:39:04,292 --> 01:39:05,334
Compromise.

1183
01:39:05,876 --> 01:39:07,417
The heroines these days, I tell you.

1184
01:39:07,751 --> 01:39:09,251
They are so bad.

1185
01:39:10,667 --> 01:39:13,501
Now I'll make Ragini MMS 3.

1186
01:39:14,084 --> 01:39:15,917
Threesome, here I come.

1187
01:39:19,334 --> 01:39:20,334
Rocks!

1188
01:39:21,209 --> 01:39:24,126
Can I kindly join?

1189
01:39:26,667 --> 01:39:27,667
Rocks.

1190
01:39:36,209 --> 01:39:37,501
Rocks.

1191
01:40:06,292 --> 01:40:07,417
That Sunny..

1192
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:08,917
She's possessed. - She killed Rocks.

1193
01:40:09,001 --> 01:40:10,001
She's possessed.

1194
01:40:10,042 --> 01:40:11,042
Meaning?

1195
01:40:11,251 --> 01:40:12,667
She's possessed.
It's okay.

1196
01:40:12,709 --> 01:40:13,709
Satya.

1197
01:40:21,251 --> 01:40:22,626
Hi, I am Dr. Meera Dutta.

1198
01:40:23,042 --> 01:40:24,292
Ragini's psychiatrist.

1199
01:40:25,126 --> 01:40:26,292
What are you doing here?

1200
01:40:26,417 --> 01:40:27,709
We don't have time.

1201
01:40:28,042 --> 01:40:30,209
There's a spirit trapped here.
If we don't free her soon..

1202
01:40:30,376 --> 01:40:32,167
..she won't let anyone go from here.

1203
01:40:32,626 --> 01:40:34,751
We'll have to do something about it,
and quick.

1204
01:40:41,292 --> 01:40:42,292
Please.

1205
01:40:43,042 --> 01:40:44,126
Keep quiet.

1206
01:40:45,417 --> 01:40:46,417
Sorry.

1207
01:41:50,209 --> 01:41:51,501
It's coming from
behind the cupboard.

1208
01:42:17,292 --> 01:42:18,292
Satya.

1209
01:42:25,417 --> 01:42:26,501
You all are coming?

1210
01:42:26,584 --> 01:42:28,292
We cannot leave from
here even if we wish to.

1211
01:42:28,376 --> 01:42:29,792
She will not let us leave.

1212
01:42:32,626 --> 01:42:33,709
Carefully.

1213
01:42:41,792 --> 01:42:42,959
Can't see anything.

1214
01:42:44,542 --> 01:42:45,542
Come here.

1215
01:43:52,834 --> 01:43:53,834
What are you doing?

1216
01:44:07,792 --> 01:44:08,834
Calm down.

1217
01:44:19,709 --> 01:44:21,292
I thought as much.

1218
01:44:22,209 --> 01:44:23,792
We'll have to perform
their final rites..

1219
01:44:23,876 --> 01:44:25,667
..or their souls
won't attain salvation.

1220
01:44:27,376 --> 01:44:28,751
Do whatever you want, doctor.

1221
01:44:30,042 --> 01:44:31,376
Just save Sunny, please.

1222
01:44:32,626 --> 01:44:34,001
I am a doctor, Satya.

1223
01:44:36,209 --> 01:44:37,501
But I will try my best.

1224
01:44:38,792 --> 01:44:41,251
Last year I met
a sage in Rishikesh..

1225
01:44:41,417 --> 01:44:42,959
..and he gave me few mantras..

1226
01:44:44,042 --> 01:44:46,584
..which separates
the soul from the body.

1227
01:44:47,251 --> 01:44:49,792
I never thought they
would be of some use, but..

1228
01:44:50,542 --> 01:44:52,417
..I guess that's our last straw now.

1229
01:44:55,167 --> 01:44:57,042
Are you sure these
mantras will work?

1230
01:44:58,334 --> 01:45:00,667
Right now there's
just one thing we can do.

1231
01:45:01,626 --> 01:45:02,626
Believe.

1232
01:45:04,917 --> 01:45:07,334
It has to. - Yes.

1233
01:45:08,167 --> 01:45:09,709
Please do fast, doctor.

1234
01:45:10,417 --> 01:45:11,417
Monali!

1235
01:45:26,251 --> 01:45:28,167
Monali, get the chair.

1236
01:45:40,959 --> 01:45:41,959
Monali!

1237
01:46:09,501 --> 01:46:10,501
Oh no!

1238
01:46:23,001 --> 01:46:24,709
I will not spare anyone.

1239
01:46:34,417 --> 01:46:35,626
Tie her up.

1240
01:46:42,001 --> 01:46:43,292
Carefully.

1241
01:46:46,376 --> 01:46:48,126
Satya, we don't have time.

1242
01:46:48,917 --> 01:46:50,084
Let me go.

1243
01:46:50,501 --> 01:46:52,334
If I don't read these
mantras quickly..

1244
01:46:52,709 --> 01:46:53,584
..then she won't go.

1245
01:46:53,626 --> 01:46:56,126
What's the point of
tying me to the chair?

1246
01:46:56,876 --> 01:46:59,167
All three are going to attack me?

1247
01:46:59,334 --> 01:47:01,084
Come on, baby. Come on.

1248
01:47:01,167 --> 01:47:02,167
Come on.

1249
01:47:03,251 --> 01:47:06,334
Come on.

1250
01:47:21,959 --> 01:47:24,001
Satya, what happened?

1251
01:47:26,501 --> 01:47:27,876
Come on, take me now.

1252
01:47:27,959 --> 01:47:28,959
F**k me.

1253
01:47:45,042 --> 01:47:47,167
There's no use.

1254
01:47:55,251 --> 01:47:56,251
Carefully.

1255
01:48:18,292 --> 01:48:19,334
Please help me.

1256
01:48:19,501 --> 01:48:22,209
Please help me.

1257
01:48:23,167 --> 01:48:24,167
It hurts.

1258
01:48:26,126 --> 01:48:27,126
Please help me.

1259
01:48:27,626 --> 01:48:28,959
Please help me.

1260
01:48:29,334 --> 01:48:30,792
Satya, please help me.

1261
01:48:46,751 --> 01:48:48,876
I'm not a witch.

1262
01:48:50,584 --> 01:48:53,751
I didn't kill my son.

1263
01:48:55,751 --> 01:48:58,334
He's mine.

1264
01:49:00,126 --> 01:49:02,501
I won't go from here.

1265
01:50:17,542 --> 01:50:19,001
Go away from here.

1266
01:50:21,167 --> 01:50:23,292
Return to the darkness
you have come from.

1267
01:51:14,584 --> 01:51:15,834
Sunny. - Wait.

1268
01:51:18,126 --> 01:51:21,501
Wait. - She's dead, Satya.

1269
01:51:21,792 --> 01:51:22,792
Sunny.

1270
01:51:24,209 --> 01:51:25,876
I think she's dead.

1271
01:51:25,959 --> 01:51:26,959
Sunny.

1272
01:51:27,959 --> 01:51:28,959
Sunny.

1273
01:51:31,959 --> 01:51:32,959
Monali.

1274
01:52:43,167 --> 01:52:44,709
Her life's stuck in that.

1275
01:52:45,001 --> 01:52:46,876
We'll have to break that, Satya.

1276
01:52:48,542 --> 01:52:49,834
No, Sunny. No.

1277
01:52:49,917 --> 01:52:50,917
Satya, don't listen to her.

1278
01:52:50,959 --> 01:52:52,084
Just break it right now.

1279
01:52:53,292 --> 01:52:54,751
Don't do that.

1280
01:52:55,376 --> 01:52:56,459
Satya, don't listen to her.

1281
01:52:58,292 --> 01:52:59,501
What if something happens to Sunny?

1282
01:52:59,584 --> 01:53:00,834
Nothing will happen to Sunny.

1283
01:53:00,876 --> 01:53:02,626
That's not Sunny. - I love you.

1284
01:53:02,709 --> 01:53:03,709
I said break it.

1285
01:53:03,959 --> 01:53:05,459
Don't do that. - Come on, Satya.

1286
01:53:08,501 --> 01:53:09,709
Break that.

1287
01:53:17,751 --> 01:53:19,001
Hold it.

1288
01:53:45,834 --> 01:53:47,501
Sunny.

1289
01:53:49,001 --> 01:53:50,001
Sunny. - Sunny.

1290
01:53:50,834 --> 01:53:51,834
Sunny.

1291
01:53:52,209 --> 01:53:53,209
Sunny, get up.

1292
01:53:53,667 --> 01:53:54,751
Sunny, open your eyes. - Sunny!

1293
01:54:01,834 --> 01:54:03,542
Sunny!

1294
01:54:07,042 --> 01:54:08,042
Sunny!

1295
01:54:17,084 --> 01:54:18,084
It's okay.

1296
01:54:23,042 --> 01:54:24,751
Please take me away from here.

1297
01:54:26,501 --> 01:54:27,251
Yeah.

1298
01:54:27,292 --> 01:54:29,459
Please take me away from here.

1299
01:54:38,501 --> 01:54:39,501
Are you okay?

1300
01:54:40,626 --> 01:54:41,626
Satya.

1301
01:54:41,917 --> 01:54:43,584
As soon as you two get
out I'll call the police.

1302
01:54:44,209 --> 01:54:46,126
He'll do the final
rites of everyone.
