Delhi-based school backbenchers Vikas ""Hunny"" Gulati and Dilip ""Choocha"" Singh are perpetually dreaming of making it big and want to get into the local college but don't have the required grades. The college guard Pandit tells them that he can provide them with the leaked class XII papers for a large sum of money. Choocha has the power to get the winning number of any lottery in his dream, and Hunny has the talent to sand the exact number out of his dream. They cannot afford or collect the money required, so they decide to sell the papers to other students but fail there too. Meanwhile, through Pandit, they meet Zafar, a former student of the college and a struggling musician. The fourth character is Lali, whose father Billa runs a sweet shop. Lali is currently pursuing his degree through correspondence and, like Hunny and Choocha, also wants to get into the same college, where his girlfriend Shalu, who ignores him all the time, studies. Pandit asks Lali to donate ₹250,000 in the college development fund to get admission, but Billa refuses to, saying college is too costly. Zafar's girlfriend, Neetu, who has broken up with him over his career choices, is now giving private tuition to Lali so that he can get the marks to get into the college of his dreams. On the other hand, Zafar's father faces a stroke and is paralysed. Zafar badly needs money for his treatment.

The four meet up at Pandit's office, where Hunny explains his scheme. However, since now they all together need a lot of money, they need someone to invest their money. On Zafar's insistence, Pandit is talked into taking them to meet a local gangster, Bholi Punjaban, where Hunny tells them their scheme. Bholi is ready to invest, and Lali also gives his shop papers as a mortgage. Bholi tells them to come the next day with the number. However, the same night, everyone except Choocha falls asleep. The next morning, Choocha narrates a fake dream, which Hunny interprets and gets a number. They go to Bholi and tell the number, but it backfires, and Bholi loses her money. Now to recover her money, she gives them a packet containing drug pills, which Zafar, Hunny, and Lali have to sell at a rave party the same night. She keeps Choocha as security with her. At the party, police and the Narcotics division conduct a raid, and Lali escapes with a packet with the police chasing him. Lali manages to fool the cops and reaches Neetu's place. He also sees Zafar there. Neetu throws the drugs down the drain just as the police are about to search her home. The cops leave her place, warning Lali. Meanwhile, Zafar tells the whole story to Neetu, and he was thinking that Neetu was falling for him, but she refuses. Zafar also warns him. Lali also calls Choocha, telling him to run from Bholi's house, which he succeeds in doing.

The next morning, all five of them land up at Bholi's place. She gives them 24 hours to pay all the money due; otherwise, she would take the money by selling Lali's shop. The four are fighting at Zafar's place, where Choocha tells them the truth about not seeing the dream. However, he says to them that he slept last night, and he saw a dream. Zafar is not interested, while Lali, Hunny, and Neetu are. Hunny interprets the dream, but they are short of cash even after Neetu is ready to give her savings. However, next morning Lali is able to borrow some money from a homeless man who used to remove parts from Lali's motorcycle. They invest and win a huge amount. They go to Bholi's house and give her the money. Hunny tells Bholi that he wants to sell the drug pills again and gives her an advance. Impressed, Bholi goes inside and returns with the pills, only to be caught red-handed by the police and Narcotics Division, who have raided her home. While Hunny, Choocha, Lali, and Neetu were investing the money, Zafar met the Narcotics Division and made a plan to catch Bholi and also called Neetu, Lali, Choocha, and Hunny, where they confessed to the police. Now with Bholi behind bars, the police pardon the four, and they are free.

Three months later, it is shown that Hunny and Choocha have become rich and are entering the same college on horses as they had planned at the beginning of the film, while Pandit is shocked to see them. Lali is making new girlfriends. Priya reunites with Honey, and Neetu gets engaged to Zafar. Lali, Zafar, Neetu, and Priya are having a good laugh."

In the present, 2016, Dr. Krishnakumar (Siddharth), a successful neurosurgeon, and his wife Lakshmi (Andrea Jeremiah) live peacefully in their beautiful house under the mountains in Rosina Valley. The D'Costa family moves into the next house, which belonged to the mother and daughter years ago. Jennifer D'Costa (Anisha Angelina Victor) is a troubled teenage daughter of the neighbors. Though she is rebellious, she deeply loves her family and her half-sister Sarah. Jenny and Sarah come to meet Lakshmi and make friends with her. Jenny is instantly attracted to Krish's charm.

The D'Costas invite Krish and Lakshmi for dinner. While exploring the house, Krish sees Jenny jumping into the well and saves her. Jenny's rebellious nature makes her do things like smoking. During one such time, when she sneaks out of the house for a smoke, she picks up some belongings of a dead person. Jenny starts to act weird soon and sleepwalks to the edge of a cliff, where her father Paul (Atul Kulkarni) and Krish save her yet again. Jenny's grandfather contacts a psychic, but Paul refuses to take any help from him. Krish refers them to his psychiatrist friend Dr. Prasad (Suresh), who gives Jenny a hypnotherapy session, and she tells him that there is someone telling her family to leave the house, and then Jenny starts speaking in Chinese. Prasad concludes she has developed paranoia with visual and auditory hallucinations and advices Paul to perform an exorcism since he is sure of some paranormal behaviors happening with Jenny. Paul calls Pastor Joshua (Prakash Belawadi) to perform the exorcism, and they find that their new house is haunted by three ancient Chinese spirits. One of them is a bloodthirsty man, while the other two spirits are the mother and the daughter, who want the family to get out of the house without trouble. The exorcism session cures Jenny, but the violent antics of the spirits injure Joshua, who falls into a coma, while Krish and Paul are also injured.

Things seem normal, and Lakshmi finds out that she is pregnant, but one day, Paul's housemaid disappears. Krish and Lakshmi also witness increasing paranormal disturbances in their daily lives. Paul finds some disturbing evidences in his house and agrees to call the psychic from earlier, and he reveals the presence of a mother and daughter spirit, asking them to leave. He also discovers their skeletal remains in the nearby cliff edge, along with the male spirit's remains.

Meanwhile, Prasad feels that there is more to the story of the spirits from Jenny's exorcism and upon researching finds that there is a witness who knows what happened in Paul's house 80 years ago, an old lady from the village. Krish and Prasad visit the old lady, who reveals that the man of the house, Lu Wei, was into black magic. He attempted to kidnap and kill her when she was a child, but his pregnant wife intervened and let her escape. It is shown that Lu Wei tried to perform the human sacrifice as a ritual so that his next offspring would be a boy. When his ritual was disturbed, Lu Wei heartlessly lures his own daughter and sacrifices her instead. Lu Wei's distraught wife witnesses this and stabs herself in the stomach, killing her and her unborn child and thereby ruining Lu Wei's plans. An enraged Lu Wei commits suicide by drowning himself in the well. The old lady further tells that all these events unfolded during a rare solar eclipse day, and a similar eclipse is bound to happen again the next day.

Krish and Prasad go back home and seemingly continue to discuss the events. The next day, Lakshmi calls out for Krish and asks him to help Jenny, since she is possessed again. When they go to Jenny's house, to Krish's surprise, Lakshmi locks him up in a room. It is then revealed that Joshua awoke from his coma and told Lakshmi that during Jenny's exorcism, he found that not only Jenny was possessed by the woman's spirit, but Krish was possessed by Lu Wei's spirit and the possession must have happened when Krish jumped into the well and rescued Jenny. Lu Wei now intends to continue where he left off and targets Sarah for his human sacrifice so that Lakshmi would give birth to a boy. It is shown that a possessed Krish had earlier killed Prasad too, since he found the truth. Krish breaks free and tries to kill Sarah and cause mayhem, but the Chinese mother-daughter spirits overpower him and destroy Lu Wei's spirit from Krish's body as the solar eclipse ends, and Krish gets back to normal.

A few years later, it is shown that Krish's family and the D'Costas are still good neighbors, while Lakshmi and Krish now have a son, with whom Jenny and Sarah go to play. The screen closes in on the boy's eye, which changes to show double irises, implying that he could be demonic, since he was conceived when Krish was possessed by Lu Wei."

Arya is found barely alive by a man walking his dog the next morning, and brought to a hospital; Devki and Anand are shattered. She suffers serious internal injuries, but recovers over the next month and names her attackers.

Inspector Mathew Francis quickly rounds up the perpetrators; however, the case falls apart when Arya is found to have consumed alcohol at the party, raising the possibility that her memory is unreliable.

Jagan is about to kill Devki when Mathew tackles him. In a standoff, Devki and Mathew point their guns at Jagan; Matthew tries to dissuade Devki by telling her that Anand is alive, and she will go to jail if she shoots Jagan.

'Sanju' (Emraan Hashmi) is an expert- master safe cracker who maintains a casual lifestyle with his wife Neetu (Vidya Balan).

He meets two criminals, Pandit and Idris and they offer him a chance to assist a bank robbery. If the heist is successful, they will ensure that he never has to worry about money again, so he accepts the offer.

The three thieves make off with 30 crore inr.

After the bank robbery, Pandit decides that Sanju should keep the suitcase of money hidden (as Pandit and Idris already have record with the police, coupled with the fact that Sanju is married, and will be the least suspected by the police ) and that they will meet after three months and then they will split the money.

After three months, Pandit and Idris discover that Sanjay lost his memory in an accident with head injury and hence, Sanju is suffering from retrograde amnesia.

Pandit and Idris decide that they can not trust Sanju anymore, they need to keep a close eye on him in case he runs away. They stay at Sanjay and Neetu's house until Sanjay remembers where he hid the money and to make sure they're not cheated. They give him a week to do so.

Sanjay tries to remember where he hid the money but he can not.

When Sanjay learns that his college friend Uttam Nagpal (Parvin Dabas) has become an overnight millionaire, apparently by winning a lottery, he suspects Uttam.

Then, he suspects his wife Neetu of knowing the hiding place of the money because she has a joint account with him and also sole-access to their bank-locker. He accuses her of conspiring with his friend.

Later, Sanju finds out that Uttam has moved to London after being confronted about the money and he also finds out that Neetu has purchased a one-way ticket for London. So, he goes to buy a gun to kill his wife Neetu in anger.

While he is doing this, an unknown person contacts Sanjay and urges him to divulge the location of the money.

Under pressure and now frustrated, Pandit and Idris kidnap Neetu and ask Sanjay to meet them in a train station by writing a note and attaching it to the screen of his TV, on the third platform at 1:30am.

When both Pandit and Idris confront Sanjay and demand the money, Sanjay claims that he doesn't even recognize the two.

When Sanjay tells them that Neetu knew where the money was, Idris begins to lose control. When he pulls the trigger on his pistol, he is shot dead by the unknown person and thereafter, he kills Pandit in a rage in the train.

The unknown person tells Sanjay that the bank robbery plan idea was his which he shared with Idris and Pandit but never got his share ...and after persistently questioning and trying to blackmail Sanjay, the unknown person shoots frantically in frustration and Neetu is injured—hoping that the traumatic vision of his wife's suffering will make Sanjay reveal the truth.

However, this fails since Sanjay has in fact lost all his memory by now, stressed by trauma.

The original mastermind of the bank heist searches Sanjay's pockets, only to find a banana. In retaliation, he shoots Sanjay in the shoulder and then Sanjay's phone rings.

It is revealed that the caller is Sanju's mother who calls her son like every other day out of her motherly affection and concern. However,during the conversation, she subconsciously reveals that the suitcase has been kept at her home while remaining implicitly oblivious as to what is in the suitcase and further questions Sanju whether he will be coming to take the suitcase or not. She further expresses her desire to sell the brief case off if in case Sanju does not turn up to take away his belonging. Meanwhile, the heist's mastermind overhears this and jumps on the train out of excitement but he slips on Sanjay's banana skin and impales his neck on Sanjay's fork. Disillusioned, confused and tired, Sanjay throws his phone out of the train while Neetu smiles. Sanjay has no idea what's going on, but the train goes on its way with the dead bodies of the mastermind, Pandit and Idris."

The movie starts with Tasha confronting Aryan about their intimate photo, which had been sent to her phone anonymously. Aryan's girlfriend Rishma appears with a gun to kill him. In a tussle, Rishma is shot and dies.

The story moves back, introducing Aryan and Rajveer, the sons of London based billionaire and politician Vikram Khurana. Looking for a fresh face to represent their company, Rajveer goes to a bar, where he is smitten by Tasha. He woos Tasha by promising her to make her a star and hires her for their company. In an attempt to lure her into bed, he pays some goons to attack her so he can swoop in as the hero. As he is paying the goons, someone takes a picture of the transaction. Aryan too is captivated by Tasha's beauty and is able to get her drunk at a party. That night, he sleeps with her, and she wakes up regretting the event. This is when their photo is sent to her phone.

In the present, Aryan convinces Tasha to quietly dispose of Rishma's body. They dump the body in a river. Tasha then reveals to the audience that she herself is the person behind all of this – the mastermind behind all the events thus far. She had known that Rajveer had hired goons and had bribed them as well; she also spiked Aryan's drink at the party, and after he passed out, she took photos with him in compromising positions to make it look like they slept together. She then sent the photos to Rishma.

Tasha continues to avoid Rajveer, making him desperate for her. Playing the brothers against each other, she publicly rejects Rajveer's proposal, telling him that Aryan told her about how Rajveer lures girls into bed and then leaves them. She also reveals that she and Aryan are involved. Aryan receives a video clip of him dumping Rishma's body.

Vikram is baffled by Rajveer's behaviour when he receives the compromising picture of Aryan and Tasha and the video of Aryan dumping a dead body. He gets a threatening call in which the blackmailer (Tasha) demands that his sons confess to the crime they committed two years ago in India. It is revealed that two years ago, Rajveer tried to force a girl named Bhavna into his car. When a passerby named Ashwin came to help her, Aryan shot him. Overcome by rage, Rajveer shot him multiple times, killing him. In the hospital, Ashwin is declared dead as his sister Natasha (Tasha) and his mother arrive. Bhavna's family is threatened by Vikram to keep silent, with Natasha vowing to avenge her brother's murder.

Presently, Rajveer, heartbroken, is unable to overcome the pain when he is informed that Aryan is the one who kidnapped his love. He confronts Aryan and threatens to reveal that Aryan killed Rishma. In the struggle to stop him, Aryan ends up killing Rajveer, then dumps him in a grave as suggested by Tasha. Rajveer's ex Monica discovers the truth about Tasha and tells Aryan. Aryan tries to kill Tasha but she successfully knocks him out and injures herself, acting innocent in front of the police, who then arrest Aryan.

In the ending credits, Tasha blames Vikram for being a bad father. At Natasha's home, Rishma, revealed to be alive, stands in front of Ashwin's picture; she had been his fiancé when he was alive."

In the village of Laalgaon in Uttar Pradesh, two Dalit girls are seen trapped in a school bus by some men. Ayan Ranjan, a St. Stephen's College, Delhi graduate and an Indian Police Service officer, is assigned to Laalgaon as the Additional Superintendent of Police and is warmly welcomed by officers Brahmadatt Singh and Kisan Jatav. Ayan encounters various forms of caste discrimination as soon as he arrives in the village, and periodically shares what he observes with his wife, Aditi, over the phone. Local villagers come to Ayan's reception asking the officers to find the missing girls but are turned down. Ayan reunites with his college friend Satyendra Rai, also a state government employee, who behaves suspiciously throughout the night.

The next morning, the girls are found hanging from a tree, while a third girl, Pooja, is reported missing. Ayan orders Brahmadatt to file an FIR and to obtain the postmortem report for the deceased girls. The girls' autopsy yields evidence that they were gang raped, but Brahmadatt prevents the release of this information and instead pushes a narrative suggesting that the girls, who were cousins, were lesbian lovers in an incestuous relationship and thus hanged by their fathers in an honour killing. Meanwhile, Jatav and a junior officer are threatened and their vehicle set on fire by followers of Nishad, leader of Bhim Sangharsh Sena (BSS), a group of activists within the village who seek speedy justice for the crime. Ayan questions Jatav about this the next day and becomes determined to solve the case.

Gaura, Pooja's sister, informs Ayan that the girls used to work for a local builder named Anshu Naharia. He slapped Pooja after the girls asked him for a raise in their salary of 3 rupees. Ayan decides to call Anshu for inquiry, even though Brahmadatt tries to persuade him not to do so, as Anshu is the son of local Minister Ramlal Naharia. During his interrogation, Anshu says that he slapped the girls in order to remind their entire caste about their place in society. Ayan, disgusted by the moral corruption of the village and its police force, posts on the police bulletin board a copy of Article 15 of the Constitution of India, which prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, caste, or birthplace.

Ayan meets with Dr. Malti Ram, a member of a scheduled caste and the assistant coroner who performed the autopsy, and finds out that contrary to her official report, the girls were raped and then murdered. He asks her to go to Lucknow to examine the DNA samples and to contact only him, realizing that local law enforcement is conspiring with Ramlal Naharia to cover up the case. Meanwhile, Mahantji, a Brahmin politician contesting in the local election, has formed an alliance with the head of the Laalgaon Dalit community in a show of inter-caste unity, but Nishad sees the display as a disingenuous political ploy and plans to protest it. Ayan tries to persuade Nishad to call off the protest, so he has men to help search for Pooja; Nishad refuses, but allows some of his men to aid Ayan's search.

Ayan soon gets a call from Malti, who confirms that Anshu was among those who gang-raped and murdered the two girls. Ayan gets an arrest warrant for Anshu and raids his house, but Anshu is not present. However, Ayan spots a school bus that was seen by local villagers around the time of the girls' disappearance, and investigates the nearby school (which is owned by Anshu), where he finds evidence from the scene of the girls' torture and rape. Elsewhere, Anshu is staying under protection from Brahmadatt, who is revealed to be one of the rapists. Brahmadatt kills Anshu to save himself.

Panikar, a high-ranking CBI officer, arrives in Laalgaon and suspends Ayan from the case. Ayan refuses to give up and tracks down Satyendra, who admits that he was at a party hosted by Anshu the night of the crime, and that he witnessed Anshu, Brahmadatt, and police officer Nihal Singh (who works closely with Ayan) rape the girls while severely drunk and later hang their dead bodies. Ayan confronts Nihal, who commits suicide out of remorse.

Jatav arrests Brahmadatt on Ayan's command. Panikar attempts to threaten Ayan into dropping the case, but Ayan reveals he has already submitted all his evidence to the Home Minister, and sharply criticizes the bigotry and injustice against people of lower castes among Indian law enforcement. Ayan then leads other officers through a large swamp in search of Pooja. They emerge on the other side in a jungle where they find a severely dehydrated Pooja hiding inside a pipe. They rescue her, and with her statement, Brahmadatt gets eleven years of imprisonment as punishment. Mahantji wins the election hands down."

Through his friends, he meets Supriya, a working woman who is also blind, but proudly independent. The two fall in love and get married. One night, on their way back home after dining out, they are interrupted by Amit Shellar, a local goon and younger brother of Madhavrao Shellar, a well-known politician. He and his friend, Wasim, drunkenly misbehave with the couple, enraging Rohan. The next morning while Rohan is at work, Amit and Wasim sneak into the house and assault Supriya. A horrified Rohan immediately calls the police; officer Chaubey advises him to get his wife medically examined in 24 hours to prove the assault. While Rohan and Supriya are on their way to the clinic, they are kidnapped by Shellar's men and held captive for 36 hours.

After being set free, Rohan and Supriya are criticized by police for the delay in getting Supriya clinically examined, and are accused of being liars. Heartbroken, they return home. Supriya attempts to live normally but Rohan becomes silent and introspective, which hurts her. One morning, Rohan returns early from work to apologize to Supriya for not being as supportive as he should have, only to find her corpse, hanging from the ceiling fan. Madhavrao visits Rohan and reveals that his brother Amit assaulted Supriya not once but twice. Rohan finds Supriya's suicide note, which ascertains that Amit had assaulted her a second time; this second assault led to her suicide. Shattered, Rohan implies to officer Chaubey that he will avenge his wife's death, mocking Chaubey that he will know who did it but will be able to do nothing about it, just like he did nothing about Supriya's case.

Rohan uses his voice-modulating skills to lure the culprits to places that Rohan knows well. First, he tricks Wasim and hangs him, leaving Amit's handkerchief behind to frame Amit. He then lures Amit to the warehouse where he and Supriya were held captive for 36 hours. He finds Amit by scent, tying him down to be burned alive in an explosion. Chaubey suspects Rohan of Amit and Wasim's murders and puts him under house arrest. Rohan gets past the police with the help of his friend and calls Madhavrao to a building under construction that was to be Rohan and Supriya's new home. There, Rohan kills him and makes it look like a suicide. Rohan later relates the story to Chaubey: he made it look as if Amit killed Wasim, then Madhavrao committed suicide due to the pain of Amit's death. With no evidence against Rohan, a blind man, Chaubey stands helpless. After this, Rohan scatters Supriya's ashes in the sea."

It is the saga of the king who loved his people and died of a broken heart when separated from them. It is the legend of the queen who never compromised with her faith and became the mother of millions of propagating love. The merger of the princely states with the Indian Union after Independence had left several kings and queens disheartened. Especially when those monarchs considered their subjects as their own children and whose objective was to improve the lot of the people. It was a difficult situation to cope with.

Maharaja Jivajirao Scindia of Gwalior was one of those unfortunate monarchs. He died prematurely, leaving his wife, Vijaya Raje Scindia, at the mercy of a political party. She struggled hard but, in the process, lost her son in the war of ideology. She was never reconciled to the fact that her son would join hands with those who brought hardship to the people. It was the beginning of the end of a relationship between a mother and her son. It was a difficult situation for the mother. But she had never bowed down to those forces and went her own way.

One of the key values of the organisation is abstinence, although senior members are married and there are no restrictions on the marriage of junior members. However, it is expected that their members should not indulge in their married life at the expense of service to the nation. His father is keen on getting him married to an educated overweight girl Sandhya. In spite of not liking her, the school drop out Prem agrees to marry her. In addition, as Sandhya is trying to be a school teacher, his family asks him to think of this alliance for financial help too. Eventually, in an elaborate community-wedding ceremony, Prem and Sandhya get married.

Prem visibly shows his disinterest in the marriage and does not consummate the marriage on the wedding night. At home, Sandhya tries to get Prem attracted to her. But he is too embarrassed to even walk with her on the street. Prem and Sandhya's relationship remains strained although they share a kiss and have sex on their second night together. The branch manager advises him that since he could not uphold his oath of abstinence he should rather focus on his married life. Over time, Sandhya's frustration shows; when Prem's aunt brings up a petty topic, the two have a heated exchange of words and she tells them how he does not treat her well.

Amidst all this a close friend of Prem, Nirmal gets married.

Meanwhile, Prem decides to channel his energy into studying and to take his English paper again; he enrolls for the examination. His friends give up on him; after a verbal squabble, they throw him out of the group. He studies sincerely for the exam, but at the time of his exam, he is overwhelmed by the emotional turmoil and is not able to write a word. Ultimately he plainly writes an emotional message to the person checking his paper that if at all he feels any pity for his state he should not award him with a zero or else his family would be reduced to zero (indicating his suicide attempt).

The film is set during World War II and centres upon the letters written by Gandhi to Adolf Hitler, and around the relationship of Hitler with his long-term lover Eva Braun, whom he married in his final days in the Berlin bunker in which they died. The film depicts the difference between the ideologies of Gandhi and Hitler and claims the superiority of Gandhism over Nazism.

Another plot within the film concerns a young Indian couple who, while both dedicated to gaining independence for India, turn to greatly different paths to achieve that goal. The wife chooses to follow Gandhi, while the husband ultimately joins the Indian Legion, leading to dramatically divergent outcomes. Even though the wife's ultimate fate is not clear, the scenes towards the end show that the husband fails to return to India alive after trying to flee the collapsing Third Reich. The film concludes with the Indian flag flying high and a note stating, ""15 August 1947: India wins freedom"", demonstrating the superiority of civil disobedience and nonviolence over militancy and terrorism."

Aakash Rana is an illegal immigrant married to British-Indian citizen Nikita, who lives as a successful engineer. He is eventually caught and deported from the UK, thus crushing his dreams of an ideal life.

Four years later, Aakash returns with a vengeance on his mind and teams up with his former employees Aadil Khan and Megha to wreak some havoc. What follows is a bomb threat on a train and a tense railway control officer, Sanjay Raina, and anti-terrorism officer, Arjun Khanna, trying every trick in the book to avert the disaster and to apprehend the culprits. Sanjay Raina tries his best to save his daughter Piya, and the passengers in the train who are thrown in the mix are police officer Shivan Menon and his team of police force, who are escorting a prisoner on the same ill-fated train. Aakash demands 10 million euros to tell them how to disarm the bomb. The ministry does not want to give the money, but Khanna convinces them that the money will be given back and is a way to lure the terrorists.

After following Aakash's instructions and dropping the money in a river, he walks away. Megha gets the money and tries to get away. She evades the cops after a vicious chase, but unfortunately, she is killed by a van in an intersection. Khanna finds out that Khan is one of the bombers and chases him. Khan is shot in the leg, but he gets away after jumping from the bridge and landing on a jet ski driven by Aakash. Aakash once again demands money and asks it to be left in a dustbin. The dustbin falls inward, and Aakash runs away with the money even though the police attempt to pursue him.

Khanna and his team find out where Aadil is and go to arrest him. Aadil commits suicide with a bomb, almost killing Khanna. Aakash calls Raina and tells him that a note has been left at a restaurant called Delhi Darbar that tells how to defuse the bomb. However, the restaurant catches on fire, and the letter is burnt. Aakash visits Nikita and his son, and they arrange to fly out of the UK that night. Khanna visits Nikita and tells her who her husband is. After changing the plan (that they should leave the UK via train because the police have found out about his plan of leaving via plane), he goes to the train station. There he sees a video of Raina asking the bomber to call again as the letter was burnt.

Aakash calls Raina and tells him that the bomb was not connected to the wheels and the train will not explode if stopped. Raina stops the train and everyone disembarks safely. Nikita, who is helping Khanna now, goes to the train station and sees Aakash and the news that the bomb threat was a hoax. Khanna pursues her and demands she tell him where Aakash is so that he can catch him. Nikita convinces Khanna that it was not Aakash that she saw. Khanna refuses to believe her lies and convinces her that Aakash is a bomber and this is the only time she can save the passengers. She tells him that he is lying to her again because the bomb in the train was a rumor and everyone is safe. Khanna tells her that she is actually helping a criminal, but she doesn't believe him because so many people's lives have been ruined by that law. She lets Aakash go, but Khanna finds out as Aakash's son calls him Daddy. Nikita tries to convince Khanna that it's not Aakash, but Khanna, knowing that she is lying, refuses to listen to her and chases him, and they fight. Aakash tells Khanna to let him go and explains why he took such drastic actions. Realizing that Aakash was a victim of deportation and wants to just be with his family again at peace, Khanna stays silent (hinting he will let him leave scot-free). However, the police arrive; after seeing that Aakash had a gun, they shoot him.

In the end, Nikita receives a letter Aakash had written. It stated that the money (which Aakash asked for to defuse the bomb) was in Aakash's bank locker. He also states that she should give half the money to Megha's brother and Adil's mother. He asks her to tell his son that what he did was to get justice. Finally, Aakash tells Nikita that if they ever meet in the next life, the end of their love story will be much better and bids her goodbye."

The film begins where the previous film ended. Ragini, since the incident in the first film, has been at Thane Mental Asylum, and even there she has been haunted by the ghost of the previous film. Meanwhile, Ragini's MMS tape has gone viral - along with rumours of the house's haunted nature, where the MMS was filmed. This catches the attention of a sleazy director, Rocks (Parvin Dabas) who decides to make a movie about the haunting. He signs an ex-porn star, Sunny Leone (Sunny Leone) as the lead actress and decides to shoot the movie in the same house where the MMS was recorded.

Sunny, who takes an instant liking to the script, seeks permission to meet the real Ragini (Kainaz Motivala), to get a better in-depth understanding of the character she wants to portray. But the meeting goes horribly wrong when Ragini stabs herself brutally in the neck.

Later, the cast and crew arrive at the haunted house to shoot and strange things begin to happen, especially to Sunny. Elsewhere, Dr. Meera Dutta (Divya Dutta), a psychiatrist who specialises in cases for which science has no answers, takes up Ragini's case. After going through old newspaper clippings and video tapes of Ragini, she finds the truth regarding the haunting.

She finds out that the ghost haunting the house was a married woman with two daughters and a son. She loved her son more than her daughters since she had conceived him after much difficulty and prayer. One day, the boy and his two sisters were playing hide and seek when the boy slipped into a well and drowned. This drove his mother insane and caused her to embark on a desperate quest to resurrect him from the dead. A Baba who claimed to perform black magic arrived and convinced her the only way to bring her son back was to sacrifice both of her daughters. The insane mother agreed and the Baba chopped off the daughters' heads. He put the sword in her hands, told her to close her eyes, and chant. While she did that he stole all of her money and ran away. When the villagers finally arrived, they assumed that the mother was practising witchcraft and punished her by hanging her from a tree, stoning her, and burning her alive. The woman survived, finally dropped from the tree, and after cursing them all, killed herself by stabbing herself in the neck with the rattle-toy her son used to play with.

Dr. Dutta then rushes to the shooting location to inform the cast and crew to abandon their shooting and leave the house immediately. But it is too late as the ghost has already possessed Sunny and started killing the film's cast and crew by either luring them into having sex or by catching them off guard. Only the scriptwriter Satya (Saahil Prem) and actress Monali (Sandhya Mridul) are left alive.

As Dr. Dutta, Monali and Satya attempt to drive the ghost out of Sunny, Monali gets killed. Afterwards, when Satya accidentally steps on the rattle toy with which the woman committed suicide prior to becoming a ghost, it causes Sunny temporary pain, and thereby forces the ghost to temporarily leave Sunny. Dr. Dutta realises the toy's importance and urges Satya to destroy it. Eventually the ghost is destroyed along with the rattle. Sunny, Satya and Dr. Dutta leave the house, having exorcised the ghost and solving the mystery behind the haunting. At the end of the movie a rocking chair is shown rocking back and forth and a child's voice is heard, implying that there is still a ghost in the house."

Across the landscapes of Bengaluru, India, at ISRO, after the failed launch of GSLV-F06 on 25 December 2010, due to a miscalculation by Project Director Tara Shinde (Vidya Balan), Rakesh Dhawan[a] (Akshay Kumar), a fellow scientist working with her, takes the blame for the mistake. As a result, he is relocated to work on Mangalyaan (Mars-craft) as punishment, where Tara joins him out of guilt. The new GSLV missions are given to Rupert Desai (Dalip Tahil), an ex-NASA scientist of Indian origin. The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) is thought of as an impossible mission by his coworkers due to its aim of reaching Mars with its tight budget.

Rakesh learns that the MOM cannot take off on the PSLV since the available technology has a payload of only 1500 kg and not enough fuel to fire the rocket to be carried to a distance of almost 55 million kilometres. GSLV, if it had succeeded, could have taken the satellite to Mars as it had a payload of 2300 kg. However, recent significant failures of GSLV have jeopardised the planned future missions.

Tara is also caught up at home between constant feuds between her husband Sunil and her son Dilip, the latter showing an interest in his namesake A. R. Rahman and Islam. Dilip has another interest in the Mars Mission. One day, when Tara has to make pooris and runs out of gas, she plans to cook the rest with the flame off. This sparks an idea on using minimal fuel on the PSLV vehicle, to reach Mars. With reluctance, opposing Rupert assigns a junior team to Rakesh and Tara.

The junior scientists' team comprises: Eka Gandhi (Sonakshi Sinha), a propulsion control expert, who is looking for any chance to get away to NASA; Neha Siddiqui (Kirti Kulhari), a spacecraft autonomy designer, who is struggling with rejection as a result of her intercommunal background despite her divorce while trying hard to find a house; Kritika Aggarwal (Taapsee Pannu), a navigation expert who is also a devoted wife to her army husband Rishi (Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub), while trying hard to get a driving license; Varsha Pillai (Nithya Menen), the satellite designer and payload expert, who faces her mother-in-law's taunts for being unable to conceive a child; Parmeshwar Joshi (Sharman Joshi), the payload expert, who relies more on the religious priest and his advice but subsequently develops a romantic interest in Eka; and Ananth Iyengar (H. G. Dattatreya), the team's structural engineer, who is trying to complete his pilgrimage to Tirumala with his wife.

After the announcement of India's second Moon mission, Chandrayaan-2, the mission's budget is cut by 50%; in between the tight schedule and minuscule budget, Tara and Rakesh continue to work on their MOM project by making several compromises, even as Kritika abruptly abandons her duties without informing the duo upon learning that Rishi has been severely wounded in action. Tara and Rakesh realise that the rest of the junior scientists working on the project have low morale and motivation to make this mission happen, leading to the team slowing down. Tara soon realises that in order to meet their budget and schedule, she must make the team members change their attitudes, and motivate them to make their dream jobs into a reality. An attempt on her part to pacify her worried husband, Sunil by tracing their daughter Anya, who hasn't arrived home yet, to a night club, eventually culminates in Sunil warming up to the party environment as he throws a comment about nostalgia. This strikes an idea in Tara's head, and the next day, she successfully motivates the team members by reminding them of their childhood passion for science, and they put all their hardwork and energy into resolving the issues with the mission to make it happen. Meanwhile, even as Kritika returns on being reminded by Rishi that she has a duty towards her country too, just like him, Varsha happens to be pregnant and soon delivers a child, for whom the team makes arrangements at the office itself, while Neha is warmly taken in by Ananth and his wife into their house (where Ananth helps her move on with her troubled past as a wife).

The MOM satellite is finally launched on PSLV on 5 November 2013 (after an 8-day delay due to weather), and is named Mangalyaan (Sanskrit: Mars-Craft) and is successfully inserted into Earth's orbit. Rakesh and his team celebrate the successful launch. However, while doing the sixth orbit-raising manoeuvre, the jets fail to launch, pushing the mission six days behind. Rupert mocks the team, while Tara continues to keep hope that something will happen. A couple months later, on the way to Mars, the satellite is hit by a solar radiation wave, which heavily damages its communication systems. When the team manages to regain communications, they realise that the solar radiation had increased the speed of the satellite and pushed it further, making up the six day gap they had incurred while doing the orbital manoeuvres with Earth. After spending a 298-day transit to Mars, MOM satellite is inserted into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014, making India the 4th country in the world to do so and the first country to do it in the first attempt.

In retaliation, Major Vihaan Singh Shergill, a Para SF officer and his unit, including his brother-in-law, Major Karan Kashyap, infiltrate and attack the Northeastern militants and also kill the key leader responsible for the ambush. After a successful strike, the Prime Minister of India congratulates him and the whole unit at a formal dinner.

Vihaan's mother is found under a bridge, and Jasmine reveals herself as an intelligence agent. The film reveals why the families of the special forces soldiers were given security due to the threat from the North-eastern terrorists.

Bleed India with a Thousand Cuts (Uri, Jammu Kashmir, India)

On 18 September 2016, four heavily armed militants attack the brigade headquarters at Uri, Jammu and Kashmir at dawn, killing 19 soldiers in their sleep. The terrorists are killed, but Karan dies in a grenade explosion due to accidentally pulling the pin attached to the terrorist's rifle, which he picked up to examine. The whole family becomes devastated, including Vihaan. The Ministry decides to take strict action against the perpetrators of the attack. National Security Advisor Govind Bharadwaj suggests the idea of a surgical strike. The Prime Minister gives it a go and gives ten days for the strike. Vihaan leaves his desk job and leaves for Northern Command base in Udhampur. He requests Chief of the Army Staff General Arjun Singh Rajawat to count him in the operation to which he agrees. Vihaan chooses the elite Ghatak Force commandos from the Bihar Regiment, and the Dogra Regiment along with the special forces as most of the soldiers killed in the attack were from these regiments. Vihaan informs them that they can no longer use their phones and disguises the mission as regular training exercises. The commandos begin their training.

Naya Hindustan (New India) (New Delhi, India)

During the planning, Govind ropes in ISRO (for providing satellite images), DRDO (for drone surveillance), and RAW (for intelligence). When he goes to meet the DRDO Chief Brian D'Souza, he chances to meet an intern named Ishaan who has developed a drone called Garuda which looks and is shaped like an Eagle. With the help of the drones and satellite images they can get the exact location of the hideouts and training camps of the terrorists. Jasmine reveals her true name as Pallavi Sharma to Vihaan, and during an interrogation, the two extract information about who planned the attack. He chooses Seerat to be his pilot, who agrees wholeheartedly. Govind also suggests intensifying the artillery shelling at the border for distraction and painting their assault helicopters with Pakistani Air Force markings. The commandos also start training under Vihaan. The Pakistani officials suspect the Indian activities but dismiss them due to underestimation.

The Surgical Strike (POK, Pakistan)

On the night of 28 September, the commandos leave for the strike in Pakistan occupied Kashmir in Mi-17 helicopters. During the mission, Vihaan's helicopter is forced not to cross the Line of Control due to the latest intelligence from spies in Pakistan that the Pakistani Army has deployed an ""AWAC"" early warning radar-based surface to air missile system in Muzaffarabad sector to bring their helicopter down. He and his team improvise by going on foot through a cave (which was very risky due to darkness and the unknown presence of other terrorists). His team successfully infiltrate and kill all the terrorists on the two launchpads. Similarly, other commando teams also manage to kill all of the terrorists. Vihaan kills Idris and Jabbar, who are the perpetrators of the Uri attack. The local police are alerted, and the commandos who are low on ammunition and time escape. On their way back, they are heavily rained down upon by gunfire from both a nearby machine gun bunker and a Pakistani Air Force Mi-17 Helicopter, which was scrambled to intercept Vihaan's team. Flight Lieutenant Seerat comes to their rescue by firing back at the Pakistani gunship, thus driving it away and eliminating the machine gun bunker. His team successfully crosses the LoC on the Indian side with no casualties. The rest of the assigned teams are also successful and are back with no casualties. Vihaan lands at Hindon Air Force Station at Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. The film ends with him, Pallavi, Govind, and the commandos happily having a formal dinner with the Prime Minister.

In a post-credits scene, Zameer, a Pakistani minister, wakes up and shouts in frustration while seeing the news of India's successful surgical strike. The scene cuts to a title card reading ""Jai Hind""."

After receiving the book, Yash learns of a conspiracy that has been set in motion, targeting only RAW agents, and takes the book and the clues to the RAW headquarters, where the agency understands the legitimacy of the situation and puts Yash in-charge of tracking down the culprit.

Yash is teamed with another RAW agent, Sub Inspector Kamaljeet ""KK"" Kaur. They track down the culprit in the Indian embassy in Budapest. The mastermind of the conspiracy against RAW agents is Shiv Sharma, a nerdy hacker. In Budapest, a cat and mouse chase begins between Shiv and KK-Yash. They come close to nabbing him several times, but he always proves to be a step ahead and manages to escape every time. While digging into Shiv's past for more information, Yash eventually learns from his aide Sawant and RAW chief Anjan Das that Shiv is actually a pseudonym used by the terrorist to mask his real identity as Rudra Pratap Singh, who is the son of a RAW agent Karan Pratap Singh.

Karan had been sacrificed in an operation years ago, and Rudra was left heartbroken after HRD Minister Brijesh Verma branded Karan and several other RAW agents as traitors, which led Rudra's mother to commit suicide. Yash learns that Rudra is now seeking revenge from RAW for betraying Karan and ultimately realizes that his real target is Brijesh. In an assembly in Budapest, Rudra gears up to shoot Brijesh, though KK and Yash reach there in time and kill him before he can do any harm. Before Rudra dies, Yash forces Brijesh to accept his mistakes in front of the media, clearing Karan's name. Rudra dies happily after hearing this.

A nude humanoid alien lands on Earth on a research mission in Rajasthan, India, and is stranded when the remote control to summon his spaceship is stolen. In Belgium, an Indian woman, Jagat ""Jaggu"" Janani Sahni, meets a Pakistani man, Sarfaraz Yousuf, and falls in love with him. Her father objects to their relationship, citing their different religions, and consults their family astrologer, godman Tapasvi Maharaj, who predicts Sarfaraz will betray Jaggu. Determined to prove them wrong, Jaggu asks Sarfaraz to marry her, only to be heartbroken after receiving an unsigned letter calling off their wedding and not to contact him.

Jaggu returns to India and becomes a journalist. She is intrigued after finding the alien distributing pamphlets about a ""missing"" God. She earns his trust by rescuing him when he attempts to take money from a temple's donation box as a ""refund"" for God's broken promises, and he opens up to her. He stole clothes and money from a couple having sex in a car and befriended a bandmaster, Bhairon Singh. He learned Bhojpuri at a brothel by holding hands and exchanging memories with a prostitute and started looking for the thief who stole his remote in Delhi, where he earned the name ""PK"" (drunk) as people thought he was intoxicated when getting confused with different religions. When told only God can help him, he began practising many Indian religions, including Hinduism, Sikhism, Christianity and Islam, attempting to find ""God"" to no avail. He found out Tapasvi had his remote but refused to return it, claiming it was a gift from God. Believing his story after a brief hesitation, Jaggu promises to help PK.

After Jaggu pranks an unknown caller in front of him, PK naively conjectures Tapasvi and his other godmen must be unintentionally dialing a ""wrong number"" to communicate with God, advising the public against engaging in meaningless rituals for their prayers. Intrigued, Jaggu encourages the public to expose fraudulent godmen by sending their videos to her news channel. Gradually, this ""wrong number"" campaign turns into a popular mass movement, much to the dismay of Tapasvi. Meanwhile, Bhairon finds the thief in Rajasthan and informs PK that he sold the remote to Tapasvi. PK realises Tapasvi was a fraud all along, intentionally misleading people. Bhairon and the thief are later killed in a terrorist attack.

Tapasvi confronts PK on air, asking him what the ""right number"" is. PK claims people should believe in the ""real"" God that created them instead of other fraudulent godmen and their ""duplicate"" God. Tapasvi claims he has a direct connection to ""God"", citing his prediction of Sarfaraz's betrayal to prove Muslims to be liars. Having absorbed Jaggu's memories earlier, PK claims he can disprove his prediction and reveals Sarfaraz had not written the letter to Jaggu, citing the presence of another bride as a possible recipient that day. Shocked, Jaggu contacts the Pakistani Embassy in Belgium, where Sarfaraz worked part-time, and learns Sarfaraz has been awaiting her call for a long time, proving he still loves her. It is revealed that Sarfaraz had found the same letter that day and, believing it to be from Jaggu, stopped contacting her. Jaggu and Sarfaraz tearfully reconnect while Jaggu's father realises Tapasvi's true colours, and forces him to return the remote to PK.

PK is able to return to his planet with his remote. When leaving, he takes two suitcases full of audio tapes, having filled them with recordings of Jaggu's voice. PK tells Jaggu that the recordings are of sounds from earth. However, Jaggu finds out that the tapes are actually of their conversations. She also finds the love note PK wrote for her earlier, realising his love for her, but reluctance to confess due to her feelings for Sarfaraz. She chooses not to confront PK directly and tearfully watches him walk towards his spaceship. After his departure, Jaggu publishes a book about PK, grateful for her experience with him. A year later, PK returns to Earth on a new research mission on human nature with more members of his species."

The two are a happily married couple going on seven years, but struggle to conceive a baby. Varun's sister Richa suggests the couple meet reputed fertility specialist Dr. Anand Joshi, who suggests they do in vitro fertilisation (IVF), a fertility technique that will enhance their chances. They agree, Varun submits sperm samples, and Dr. Joshi seemingly places the couple's embryo created in his lab in Deepti's uterus.

12 days later, Varun and Deepti are hastily summoned by Dr. Anand's wife, Dr. Sandhya Joshi, where the two run into another couple: Honey Batra and Monika ""Moni"" Batra, who have elected IVF as well. Anand guiltily reveals that a sperm mix-up has occurred due to the two couples homonymous surname: Varun's sperm have been fertilised Monika's eggs, and Honey's sperm with Deepti's eggs. Shocked beyond belief, both couples attack the two doctors. The doctors suggest that the couples go for a minor procedure so there is no chance of pregnancy. Varun later learns from Honey that Monika is pregnant with Varun's child, and Deepti is pregnant with Honey's child, but his rudeness causes Honey to fear the loss of his own child. He vows to prevent an abortion on Deepti's part, and he and Monika rent out a flat just above Varun's and Deepti's, much to the couple's shock.

Varun and Deepti initially project frustration against Honey and Monika during the first six months of pregnancy for interfering in their lives. However, during a routine check-up in the seventh month of pregnancy, Sandhya advises Deepti to try talking to Monika, who is probably going through as much as she is, being emotionally distressed. Realising that she needs to try to understand the situation, Deepti asks Monika out for a street food treat, during which they start getting to know each other. Deepti learns that Monika had suffered two miscarriages, making her sympathise, and the women bond. However, Varun still nurses a negative attitude, especially since Deepti is not carrying his child. She takes a stand in Honey's and Monika's favour for the first time, angrily telling Varun that he never cared to understand anything that happened post the mishap.

Varun, with Deepti's confrontation still fresh in his mind, makes an attempt to bond with Honey when they meet at a bar, and they almost strike a chord with each other, until Honey expresses concern over Deepti's work commitments, which he thinks will have a negative impact on the child. Varun, incensed, snubs Honey in a possessive manner, an argument between the two escalates until Varun storms out and Honey is arrested after the manager drops a call.

That night, amidst heavy rains, Monika knocks on Deepti's door in desperation: she has gone into premature labour and Honey is nowhere to be found. Varun hurriedly drives Monika to the hospital and she gives birth to Varun's child. However, the newborn is shifted to a critical unit in grave condition, having been born with a respiratory defect, accelerated by Monika's history of miscarriages, with little chance of survival. As it dawns on him that the baby is in fact his, Varun begins crying and hugs Honey when he arrives after being let off with a warning. Even as Honey and Monika reunite, he goes home and breaks down in Deepti's arms, apologising for his past insensitivity.

For a few weeks, both couples pray for the baby's recovery and Monika remains in the hospital as Deepti tends to her. The baby finally recovers and after 2 months, Deepti too has a successful delivery. Varun, now a changed man, invites Honey and Monika to meet the baby.

In November 1942, shortly after the Japanese take over Burma, a group of Chinese men from the Green Gang are unloading opium in Calcutta. They are suddenly ambushed and their leader gets brutally blinded by a mysterious figure. Three months later, the leader decides to return to Calcutta to investigate their missing opium.

Meanwhile, Ajit Kumar Banerjee takes help from Byomkesh Bakshi to find his missing father Bhuvan Banerjee. Byomkesh initially rejects the request, but decides to investigate after his lover marries someone else. The following day, Byomkesh visits the lodging house Bhuvan resided in, headed by Dr. Anukul Guha, and takes a room to investigate. Byomkesh finds Bhuvan's paan box with Ashwini Babu, Bhuvan's roommate, and deduces that he was murdered. Byomkesh visits the closed chemical factory where Bhuvan used to work earlier and meets Anguri Devi, an actress and a wife of the factory's owner Gajanan Sikdaar. Byomkesh finds some letters with Anguri Devi and deduces that Bhuvan was blackmailing Sikdaar, who might have killed Bhuvan and hid his body in the factory.

Byomkesh and Dr. Guha return to the factory and find Bhuvan's body in a machine, causing Deputy Commissioner Wilkie to question Sikdaar. However, Byomkesh discovers the letters are falsely backdated and saves Sikdaar from being framed. Byomkesh follows him home, but is stopped by Anguri Devi, who attempts to seduce him. Byomkesh meets Sikdaar, who immediately has a fit and passes away, having been poisoned. Suspicion falls on Sukumar, who was seen making death threats to Sikdaar. Dr. Guha leaves Calcutta temporarily, but sends Byomkesh a stamp, confirming he had faked the letters and killed Bhuvan. Satyavati, Sukumar's sister, pleads with Byomkesh to help her brother, who she believes is innocent and in hiding. Byomkesh finds the cab Sukumar was last seen in, and the driver directs him to the office of Dr. Watanabe, a Japanese dentist. Byomkesh and Ajit meet Watanabe, saying that they are volunteers for Sukumar's Basant Panchami agitation, but Watanabe suspects them and sends a real volunteer to follow them. Having observed this, Byomkesh and Ajit disguise themselves before following the volunteer back to Watanabe's office. Discovering the ruse, Watanabe kills the volunteer and his receptionist before escaping. The two enter his office and see their corpses, where Byomkesh finds a drawing in the volunteer's pocket.

Returning to the lodge, Byomkesh and Ajit meet Dr. Guha, who admits that he and Sukumar are working with the Japanese to free the country, with Sukumar to lead a Free Bengal, and killed Bhuvan and Sikdaar for betraying them. Returning to their room, Ajit vents about his father, revealing Bhuvan had lost his job at Hind Chemicals when they learned his master formula contained opium and addicted customers. Realising Ashwini is addicted to Bhuvan's custom paan blend, Byomkesh takes a chew and euphorically creates a mural of his understanding of the entire case, revealing Sikdaar said the words Young Gun to him before dying. The next morning, Byomkesh tests the mixture and his own blood; while his blood contains heroin, the paan is clean, making him deduce that Bhuvan had created an ""untraceable"" formula. Byomkesh learns from Kanai Dao, a fellow lodge resident and licensed opium dealer, that the opium supply in the local areas has been halted, and asks him if he can help Byomkesh meet any heroin suppliers. However, Kanai turns out to be a police informer and turns Byomkesh and Ajit to Wilkie, who tells Byomkesh about Yang Guang, a former Green Gang leader who wanted Calcutta's opium business for himself, and was killed in retaliation, but reportedly survived; Byomkesh realises Sikdaar was referring to him about Yang Guang.

Byomkesh discovers the drawing actually depicts the course of the Ganges through Calcutta and Sukumar's campaign points. With Kanai's help, Byomkesh meets with the Green Gang, where they realise Yang had set a deal with the Japanese to use opium smuggling routes to invade Calcutta by surprise on Basant Panchami, in turn giving Yang control over the city's drug trade. Byomkesh realizes that Anguri Devi is Yang's lover, whom she has not met in 4 years, and she had killed Sikdaar and attempted to seduce Byomkesh on his orders while being unaware of Yang's deal with the Japanese. With the attack scheduled for the next day, Byomkesh meets Wilkie and requests him to set off all air raid sirens at 4 AM, but Wilkie refuses, and Kanai defects to Byomkesh for saving him from the Green Gang. Byomkesh requests Dr. Guha, Satyavati, Sukumar and Dr. Watanabe to meet him at the lodge, pretending to have joined them and claiming they have been betrayed. At the lodge, Byomkesh reveals Dr. Guha is Yang Guang, conned the idealistic Sukumar into his deal, and plans to make Calcutta as the drug capital of the world. Byomkesh states that he informed the authorities about the landing points, but Yang claims that he is bluffing. Anguri Devi attempts to dissuade Yang, nearly shooting him, but he shows affection to draw her in before stabbing her. The air raid sirens are set off; using this, Byomkesh convinces Watanabe to leave and stop the attack to save his men. The Green Gang, having secretly observed the proceedings with Kanai's help, attack Yang.

Byomkesh informs a panicking Satyavati that he was indeed bluffing before being struck unconscious in the chaos. Byomkesh regains consciousness, where he is told by Ajit that the Green Gang has taken Yang. Byomkesh asks Satyavati to marry him, to which she smiles in reply. The Green Gang's leader orders his son to blind Yang in revenge at an abandoned factory, but Yang purposely blinds himself with the poker to turn the tables and kill the gang, where he plans the same for Byomkesh. As the factory siren rings, Byomkesh realises something is amiss."

Koose Muniswamy Veerappan, during his teenage years starts working as an assistant to his relative Sevi Gounder, a notorious poacher and sandalwood smuggler. His father and relatives, whose village lay in the forest area, were also known to be poachers and smugglers. Veerappan (Sandeep Bharadwaj), dominant in Sathyamangalam Forest in the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, defies the governments, and Indian Border Security paramilitary forces, and maintains a small army. He is wanted for killing approximately 184 people, about half of whom were police officers, including senior police and forest officials. He was also wanted for poaching about 200 elephants and smuggling ivory worth US$2,600,000 and about 10,000 tonnes of sandalwood worth approximately US$22,000,000.

In 1991, Veerappan and his chief Intel Gandhi, beheaded IFS Officer P. Srinivas. Years later, Veerappan avenges the death of his close associate Gandhi by misleading Special Task Force (STF) personnel in their covert operation, through Gandhi's unnamed notorious informer. The covert mission led by T. Harikrishna S.P., and his informant S.I. Shakeel Ahmed to kill Veerappan fails miserably. Veerappan and his army brutally assassinate all the STF officers in the operation and snatch their arms.

The Tamil Nadu STF chief K. Vijay Kumar I.P.S. appoints his associate, an undercover I.P.S. spy in the Karnataka region, a master-strategist (Sachiin J Joshi), who puts in place Operation Cocoon through a network of tribals, and informers, such as a deputy spy, a woman STF spy and landlord (Lisa Ray), who befriends and rents out a house to Muthulakshmi-the wife of Veerappan (Usha Jadhav). On the other hand, a team of loyal undercover cops led by Rambo Krishna, leaves Palar base of STF, near M. M. Hills, 100 kilometres (62 mi) from Kollegal of Karnataka along with a team of 41 members which includes police from two states, forest officials, forest watchers and informers. The team travels in two vehicles, of which one is a bus carrying most of the team members, and a jeep carrying K. Gopalakrishnan, the IPS officer. Veerappan's gang plants landmines on the road in more than 14 places to halt their approach, and during the Palar blast, K. Gopalakrishnan, standing on the footboard of the jeep, is thrown out, and suffers severe injuries, leaving the police to retaliate and ultimately prevent the snatching of arms.

After a few failed attempts, including the one led by another undercover cop, disguised as a subordinate to Islamic underworld don - Kadaani, to negotiate an arms deal with Veerappan's gang, the STF team led by master-strategist, and an ex-spy turned timberyard owner-Kumar, finally succeeded on 18 October 2004. On that day, Veerappan is escorted out of the forest by Kumar, who earlier infiltrates Veerappan's gang in disguise to negotiate another arms deal with Velupillai Prabhakaran. Subsequently, Veerappan and his men board an ambulance stationed at Papparapatti village in Dharmapuri district. Veerappan and his men are first warned and then asked to surrender, which was denied, and the men start firing at the STF personnel. The STF retaliate by firing grenades and gunfire, subsequently, Veerappan and his men are killed on the spot."

The film opens in 2016 BCE with Sarman (Hrithik Roshan), a young man from the village of Amri, who lost his parents at a young age. Sarman kills a crocodile that has been terrorizing his village's fishermen and is hailed as a hero. He asks his uncle, Durjan (Nitish Bharadwaj), to allow him to go to Mohenjo Daro to trade their family's goods, but his uncle refuses. Sarman attempts to sneak away to the city at night with his friend Hojo (Umang Vyas) but is caught by Durjan, who relents and allows both friends to go. He gives Sarman a seal that contains an inscription of a unicorn that Sarman often sees in his dreams, suggesting he uses it only once in a life-or-death situation.

Arriving in Mohenjo Daro, Sarman learns that the city is ruled by the tyrannical Senate Chief Maham (Kabir Bedi) and his wicked son Moonja (Arunoday Singh). He also learns that the unicorn he sees in his dreams is the symbol of the city, and feels the city is oddly familiar to him. While Sarman is trading, Maham proposes to impose an additional tax on the farmers so that the city may grow, but Sarman leads the farmers to oppose the taxes so that their families don't starve to death. Sarman gains access to the upper city by showing his uncle's amulet and meets Chaani (Pooja Hegde), the daughter of the head priest (Manish Choudhary) of Mohenjo Daro. Sarman is enchanted by Chaani's beauty and charm and falls in love with her. Upon meeting, the head priest strangely appears to recognise Sarman. Chaani reveals to Sarman that she has been forcibly betrothed to Moonja. Maham discovers that Sarman and Chaani love each other and that Sarman is the leader of the tax revolt, so he challenges Sarman to fight Bakar and Zokar, his two champions. Sarman proposes that if he wins, Chaani will be released from her engagement, and Maham accepts the terms.

On the night before Sarman's clash with Bakar and Zokar, the head priest reveals to him how Maham was expelled from Harappa for illegal trade with the Sumerians. Maham entered Mohenjo Daro as a trader and quickly rose to become the trade chief. Maham had discovered that the mighty Sindhu River held vast gold deposits, so he decided to place a dam on the river and divert its course to mine the gold. The wise Senate Chief Srujan (Sharad Kelkar), who is revealed to be Sarman's father, opposed this, but Maham won the vote to build the dam. He had Srujan framed and arrested for hoarding gold. Chaani's father and Durjan – Sarman's uncle – were coerced by Maham to betray Srujan, and the former was killed later by Moonja – Maham's son. Maham then took Srujan's place as the new Senate Chief.

In the arena outside the city, Sarman faces the ferocious Tajik mountain cannibals Bakar and Zokhar. After a vicious battle, he kills one of the cannibals but spares the other, and the people of Mohenjo Daro surge even stronger behind him. Enraged, Maham urges Moonja to finish off Chaani and the priest. Moonja kills the priest, but Sarman saves Chaani and kills Moonja.

Sarman exposes Maham's plan to use the gold from the Sindhu to enrich himself and to smuggle in weapons from the Sumerians. All the chiefs now stand against Maham. The people elect Sarman as the new chief, but Sarman suggests Mohenjo Daro needs a people's government, not a chief. With the arrival of a heavy thunderstorm, Sarman realises that the dam will burst and the Sindhu river will flood the city. He rallies the people to lash boats together and form a floating bridge. They evacuate Mohenjo Daro and cross to the other side of the river. The dam collapses, and Maham, chained in the city square, drowns as the city is destroyed. The survivors migrate to another river, where Sarman sees the unicorn of his dreams and names the river Ganga."

The story begins with Fugga, a successful person, giving a talk in London. Fugga recalls his experience of learning from his teacher, Anand Kumar.

The scenes go back in time to show a younger Anand in college. Anand is a lower-class student who has a passion for studies and is good at it. At a local competition felicitation, the local minister, Shriram Singh, proud of him, promises to help whenever needed.

Anand frequently goes to Banaras Hindu University's library to learn mathematics by solving problems in a foreign Math journal. One day, the library supervisor finally catches him and says that he has no right to read there. One staff member suggests he get his article published in this journal and earn a free lifetime subscription to it. Anand goes to the post office, where his father Rajendra works as the head, and posts a letter regarding the solution to a difficult Math problem that no one has been able to solve yet. He then gets featured in the journal for solving the problem and gets a letter from Professor Richard of the University of Cambridge to join a program there.

Anand's family supports him completely, but the family has not enough money for him to travel to England. Anand and Rajendra go to the minister Shriram Singh for help, but he denies any such promise. Anand tries to show his medal as proof and a reminder of Shriram's word of honor, but still does not get the money. They both try to collect money but remain helpless. The same night, Rajendra has a heart attack and passes away while his sons rush him to the hospital. Anand refuses to go to Cambridge due to his father's death and their financial condition.

He then sells papads in the city to add income to the family. One day, he meets Lallan Singh, a [crony\servant] of Shriram Singh, who runs a high-profile coaching center. Lallan takes Anand in as a teacher at his own 'Excellence Coaching Centre'. This helps Anand financially and also earns him praise for his teaching. One fateful day, Anand sees the plight of a boy who had to leave due to poverty. Recalling Rajendra's words, he realizes that these poor kids also have a right to study. Eventually, he leaves the coaching center and starts separate tuition for poor kids in which he enrolls 30 kids at a time. Unfortunately, this hurts him financially and also costs him the support of his love interest, Supriya. But he decides, nonetheless, to teach the kids in an enthusiastic and practical manner by clearing concepts in an easy and fun way. All this enrages Lallan, whose center is facing criticism for not retaining Anand.

Lallan, in an effort to bring back Anand, tries to give free geometry boxes to Anand's center but does not succeed. He challenges Anand to a duel, in which Lallan's students and Anand's students write the same exam, and the coaching center with the lowest average score would be closed. The exam happens; in a ceremony announcing the results of the exam, Anand's students are devastated to know that they lost. To present the papers which Anand signed before the competition, Lallan invites Supriya and her husband Purshottam, an IAS officer, which shocks Anand. However, the papers are not found, which spurs Anand to deny such claims of him signing the papers. It is later revealed that Supriya hid the papers, meaning that she understood Anand's decision to tutor poor kids.

While in course of the tuition, Anand gets immense help from his brother Pranav and his mother Jayanti. Lallan and Shriram plot to have Anand and the students killed so that his kids won't take the Indian Institute of Technology exam (IIT-JEE). Anand is hurt brutally by two of Lallan's henchmen and is hospitalized, on the verge of death. He tells his students to use their knowledge to defeat the goons sent by Shriram, while he is being treated. The students, in unity, use their knowledge of different concepts and subjects and defeat the goons. Anand is treated successfully and recuperates. A few months later the students take the IIT exam and all 30 of them crack it successfully."

Masaan tracks the lives of two young people in Varanasi, India.

Devi Pathak (Richa Chadda), a trainer at a coaching computer center and her student, Piyush Aggarwal, are caught having sex in a hotel room by policemen who had been tipped off by the hotel staff. Inspector Mishra records the barely clad Devi on his mobile phone. Piyush locks himself in the bathroom and commits suicide by slitting his wrists. Inspector Mishra threatens to book Devi for abetting Piyush's suicide and demands a bribe of INR 300,000 from Devi's father Vidyadhar Pathak, a Sanskrit professor who now runs a book shop with an income of about Rs 10000 per month. Pathak is tempted by a betting game, where people bet on small boys to dive and collect the maximum number of coins from the Ganges riverbed within a specified time. He had previously barred Jhonta, a boy who works at his shop, from participating in the diving game but relents after Mishra's threats increase. Devi cycles through jobs at different coaching centers, facing harassment by colleagues as the news of her affair spreads. She eventually gets a temporary government job in Indian Railways, but tells her father she wishes to leave Varanasi to study at Allahabad University as soon as Mishra's bribe is paid in full.

Deepak Kumar (Vicky Kaushal) is the youngest of a Dom family working in the cremation ghats. He is a civil engineering student at a polytechnic college. Deepak's father doesn't want to see his sons continue the hereditary job. Deepak falls in love with Shaalu Gupta (Shweta Tripathi), a high caste Hindu girl. They start meeting each other and during a trip to Allahabad on the banks of the Ganges, they share an intimate moment. Back in Varanasi, Deepak tells her about his caste and the work he does burning corpses. Shaalu doesn't mind and says that she is ready to run away with him if her parents refuse. She asks him to focus on his exams and getting a good job.

On a pilgrimage trip with her family, Shaalu dies in a bus accident. Her body with those of other victims ends up at the same cremation ground where Deepak's family works. Deepak is devastated on seeing her dead body. He eventually overcomes his grief and is hired by Indian Railways as an engineer in Allahabad.

In a special diving competition, Pathak bets Rs 10000, a significant portion of his remaining savings, on Jhonta. Jhonta drowns and is taken to a hospital by Vidyadhar, who vows to never let the boy participate in the diving competition again. As Jhonta regains consciousness, he is shown to have found Shaalu's ring, which had been thrown into the Ganga by Deepak in a fit of grief. Jhonta gives it to Vidyadhar, who sells the ring to fully pay off Inspector Mishra.

Before leaving Varanasi, Devi visits Piyush's family, where his father shouts at and slaps her away. She comes to the banks of the Ganges to immerse the gift Piyush had given her on that fateful day in the hotel. Deepak, who is by the bank, notices her crying and offers her water to drink. A boatman beckons, offering both of them a ride towards Sangam. They both board the boat and strike up a conversation."

The other driver is thrown from her vehicle and smashes into their windshield and is killed on the spot. Some weeks later Uday gets a new project to revive a failing factory in Jabalpur (Uday's home town). Uday is excited to meet his old childhood friends and, more important, hopes that the change of place will help Ayesha recover from the shock from the accident.

They arrive in Jabalpur to a warm welcome from Uday's friends, and Ayesha spends the next few weeks setting up the home and planning events and visits with friends. As time goes by, strange things happen at the factory: machines inexplicably move and crash and employees are crushed, and at home, the gas range and toasters seem to have a will of their own. Ayesha is also perturbed by their immediate neighbors, the hot headed Manohar and his quietly suffering wife Urmi. The servant woman suggests consulting a local baba (healer and exorcist) who quickly concludes Ayesha is being attacked by an evil spirit. The baba suggests an exorcism but before this can be performed, the spirit, now angry, impales and kills the servant woman (with a deer head bust) and the baba. Around this time Ayesha's father hears about these strange events and quickly finds Ugr Pratap and sets off for Jabalpur.

Uday dismisses all the spirit theories and consults a doctor. Uday brings Ayesha to the factory hoping it will take her mind off the events. (Ayesha leaves their child, Sunny, with Urmi.) Ayesha notices that Uday's office has an old photograph of the factory manager and staff and among them are Manohar and Urmi. It is revealed that Manohar was the factory manager some sixty years ago and is now dead! Ayesha rushes back home in horror and runs into Urmi's house. It is uninhabited and dilapidated! Ayesha finds an old newspaper clipping which explains how Manohar was caught embezzling and was dismissed and arrested. Unable to bear this great dishonor, he poisoned his wife and child and himself. As this horrific truth dawns on Ayesha the spirits of Manohar and Urmi and their daughter show themselves. The spirit of Manohar bitterly says it will never let the factory carry on. And with that the three spirits possess Ayesha completely.

Ayesha returns home and now launches her reign of terror on the other servants. Her father and Ugr Pratap arrive just as Ayesha attacks Uday himself. Ugr Pratap fights back with his spiritual kamandal. There is a long battle as the spirit flees to the river bank and repeatedly attacks Ugr Pratap. Uday finally plunges the charmed trisul (trident) into Ayesha and dispatches all the spirits to the other worlds.

Eight innocent but feisty kids lead carefree lives in Chandan Nagar, a colony in Mumbai, where each has his own identity and a nickname based on these qualities. Not only that, but their whole team has a nickname that has earned them significant notoriety, ""Chillar Party"". They have mainly two enemies – the 'oversized' neighbouring cricket team, to whom they always lose, and a dog they named ""Loose Motion,"" since she dirties their cricket pitch, so they develop an enmity against dogs.

Their hopes are shattered shortly after a boy, Fatka, who was employed for washing the cars of the society, enters with his dog Bhidu. They do everything to throw the boy and his dog out, but become unsuccessful. Eventually they develop a friendship with each other as Fatka helps them by serving as the lead bowler during the match with the neighbouring cricket team. During this time, they also start interacting with a young girl who moves in and an unemployed youngster who becomes successful after Fatka helps him out.

But their happiness is short-lived when a reckless politician, welfare minister Shashikant Bhide, enters their life after his personal secretary Dubey is attacked by Bhidu for hurting Fatka. Bhide announces in a news telecast that all the stray dogs roaming about in residential buildings in Mumbai will be caught and terminated, misleading audiences with a concern for public safety. He further informs that the dog(s) can only be saved if the society files a No Objection Certificate within 1 month. The kids, shocked by this, strive hard to get the NOC, wherein they have to get at least more than 50% votes of the total residents in the society, i.e., 31 votes. But they manage only 10 votes after 15 days.

With more efforts gone in vain, the kids finally organize a march across the streets purely in underwear. This gains them enough traction to pull 10 more votes. With more hard work and awareness, they manage to get another 10 votes, counting a total of 30 votes. With only a day left for the deadline as declared by Bhide, they approach secretary L.N. Tandon, who is close to Bhide and has resented the kids all this while. While all this chaos is going on, a TV channel invites Bhide and the kids for face-off. Seeing this as their last chance, they attend the interview, which is being telecast across India. Knowing that that is the last day and dog catchers are after Bhidu, they pray hard to save him.

During the interview, they are constantly mocked by Bhide, who questions their education and upbringing, but it soon takes a turn and culminates in the kids answering Bhide back with their moral education responses. Having won, the kids plead to leave after a moving speech by Fatka, and the interviewers agree. When they reach the society, they are disheartened as there is no sight of Bhidu. Suddenly, Bhidu comes jumping in, wearing a collar reading ""Bhidu-Chandan Nagar Society."" While they are happy seeing Bhidu, they realize Tandon changed his mind after the face-off; he too is happy and seen cheering for them."

Three Pakistani youth throw packets of drugs across the border to India for it to be picked up later. Tejinder ""Tommy"" Singh, better known as ""Gabru"" among his fans, is a young and successful Punjabi musician who lives a luxurious lifestyle. Together with an ostentatious crew led by his uncle Tayaji and cousin Jassi, he routinely indulges in cocaine consumption. Tommy is popular for his energetic songs with lyrics that often glorify violence and drug addiction. However, his addiction costs him his music contract and lands him in jail. While in prison, he meets two of his die-hard fans who remark how Tommy's lifestyle had 'inspired' theirs, leading them to murder their own mother for drug money. Realizing that his songs have negatively affected teenagers, Tommy decides to change his ways upon release. A few days later, he engages in an altercation and inadvertently shoots Tayaji, injuring his ear. This causes Tayaji to send Tommy and his crew away to a farmhouse so that he can prepare for an upcoming concert.

Working on the farm is a migrant worker from Bihar nicknamed Bauria, whose dreams of playing national-level hockey for the country were shattered due to her father's death, pushing her to Punjab to work as a laborer. She works for a local landlord who uses agriculture as a front for drug-peddling. One night, she finds a suspicious packet on the farm and realizes that it is some kind of a drug. She resolves to sell it but her search for a potential buyer lands her in trouble as she unwittingly contacts the original owners of the heroin. She is captured by the gang of drug peddlers but not before she discards it into a well. As a compensation for their lost drugs, the peddlers forcibly keep her at their house, where she is sexually and physically abused, given drugs, and pimped to men. Some weeks later, she manages to escape.

Over in the neighboring town lives Preet Sahni, a doctor and activist who runs a rehabilitation center. Sartaj Singh is a junior policeman who knows about the drug smuggling his seniors are allowing on a large scale. But when it affects his family, as his brother, Balli, overdoses and is brought to Preet's clinic, he realizes the grave situation. Preet and Sartaj decide to find the root cause of the problem together. Balli is admitted into her drug rehabilitation centre against his will.

At his concert, instead of singing, Tommy starts preaching. Infuriated by his speech about how one should lead one's life, his fans start throwing bottles at him. The angered Tommy urinates in front of the crowd before fleeing. He hides in an old structure and meets Bauria, also hiding. The two share their stories and bond. However, Bauria is recaptured by the same gang when she defends Tommy from being attacked by them. He learns the next day that an arrest warrant has been issued for him because of the public ruckus at the concert, and sets out to find Bauria after realising his feelings for her.

Preet and Sartaj find that the driving force behind the drug problem in Punjab is an elderly man called Virender Singh, who has flourished with the support of his father-in-law, MP Maninder Brar. The two go to extreme measures to collect evidence against the politician and put together a report to be sent to the state's Election Commission to thwart Brar's campaign for another term in power. Sartaj and Preet fall in love; however, one night, Preet sees a manic Balli trying to escape from her rehab center. On trying to stop him, she is accidentally stabbed in the neck by him. As Balli is Sartaj's brother, senior officer Jhujar Singh who investigates the homicide decides to send him underground. While falsifying the crime scene he comes across the report made by her and Sartaj, and is infuriated when he sees that he too has been named in the drug racket. He calls Sartaj and knocks him out when he arrives.

Waking up in the presence of the local drug mafia at their farmhouse, where Bauria is also confined, a bruised and beaten Sartaj is questioned by Jhujar, who is a key member in the drug racket. Sartaj says whatever he did was for the sake of Punjab. At the same time, Tommy enters the house, armed with a hockey stick. Taking advantage of the distraction, Sartaj grabs Jhujar's gun and shoots the whole gang before freeing Balli. Tommy helps Bauria escape from her captors. Balli kneels and cries in front of his brother, whose face is expressionless.

Eventually, it is shown that the government issued an inquiry into Brar's activities and there has been a huge crackdown on the drug menace. Over in Goa, amidst his crew members, Tommy calls Bauria to ask for her real name. Sitting by the beach, she catches sight of a foreigner having fun. Inspired, she says ""Mary Jane"", to which Tommy flirtatiously replies that she is his ""life"", and she ends the call before going for a swim.[a]"

She has applied for a loan and her loan gets pre-approved. In the meantime, Praful decides to go with her cousin on a trip to Las Vegas (her cousin pays for all tickets and accommodations).

In Las Vegas, she plays baccarat for the first time and wins big in her first few rounds. She quickly gets addicted to the game. The next day, she returns to the casino but ends up losing not only the money she won the previous day but a large chunk of her savings also.

Praful then returns to Atlanta after a week, only to find out that her bank application to the bank has been rejected as her credit rating is very low. Praful seeks her father's help but he insists that she should meet a young man named Sameer (Sohum Shah) who has been selected as her suitor.

After meeting with the suitor, she has mixed feelings about marriage and agrees to get engaged. However, her addiction to gambling takes a toll on her and Praful gives her last shot to gambling and goes back to Vegas.

Unfortunately, she ultimately loses all her savings so a private money lender spots Praful (who is now drunk) in the casino and offers her money. The drunk Praful – not in her right senses- takes $32,000 from the moneylender and in exchange gives him her driving license.

Praful loses all that borrowed money (along with her hard-earned savings) and has to return penniless to her home.

Praful tries to explain to her father her bad situation and needing his financial help, but in fear of retaliation and hostility, she is reluctant. Her parents want her to begin her wedding preparations and plans with Sameer, who by now gets impressed by her personality.

At a relative's wedding, Praful and Sameer meet again and dance, and get to know each other. However, Praful is threatened by the loan sharks to pay within 10 days or face death, so she is disturbed and anxious, unable to concentrate on her wedding plans.

Therefore, Praful develops the habit of stealing whereby first she disguises herself (wearing oversized sunglasses and a hood) and approaches a cashier at a gas station shop. She collects only $10,000 so she has to go and rob a bank (which she learns how to on YouTube), with a disguise, and hands a note written with red lipstick that says money should be given to her otherwise she will blow the whole bank as she is strapped to a bomb.

Praful's second robbery gets foiled by a bank manager who bumps into her when she tries to rob the bank similarly. When the manager asks her name, Praful tells her name 'Simran', the name of a popular character from an Indian blockbuster film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge which her mother ultimately watches often.

Although Praful's plan to rob the bank gets foiled, she manages to escape and similarly robs another bank.

Praful Patel has now become a most wanted criminal with the name 'Simran – The Lipstick Bandit'. Despite robbing 3 to 4 banks successfully, Praful is still short of collecting fifty thousand dollars.

Meanwhile, Praful develops a liking towards Sameer, and confides in him her bad habits of gambling and stealing which he does not take seriously, thinking it is some kind of a joke. Trouble comes back when loan sharks attack Praful in her hotel for the money and Praful's ex-boyfriend Mike – the general manager of the hotel steals the money from her locker room and refuses to give the money back to her until and unless she submits to his sexual advances/desires.

Praful ultimately hits him and gets suspended from the hotel, after which she tells the loan sharks that her money has been stolen. By now, these loan sharks know that Praful is actually 'Simran – The Lipstick Bandit', so they ask her to rob one more bank and this time with a bigger amount—for which they offer her a gun to finish the job.

Devastated and dejected, Praful calls off her relationship with Sameer and asks him to leave and by telling him the truth. Enraged by this, Praful's father slaps her and asks her to leave his house.

Praful leaves her home and stays with her best friend Salma (Esha Tewari) for a night. The next day Praful attacks the same bank that rejected her bank loan and flees the place after stealing the money.

Sameer is still in love with Praful and to help her, he transfers a huge amount of fifty thousand dollars in her bank account.

Praful, before leaving the city of Atlanta, calls him at a lonely place and tells him that he should find another girl, as he is a nice man and he deserves someone better; not someone like her.

Sameer refuses and asks her to surrender to the police and end this dirty game once and for all; after which Praful's dad calls her and asks for forgiveness. Praful is happy at this and returns home but the police cars have surrounded her and are following her car to arrest her.

Praful drives off because she did not want to get arrested in her neighbourhood, which is full of Indians, and her parents would be very ashamed of her there. The ultimate chase begins as Praful's car is found empty by the police. Praful had taken a taxi and was almost near the airport, but then she decides to surrender on a lonely highway. She asks the taxi to stop at the curbside and then she calls 9–1–1 and surrenders herself.

After her arrest, there is a trial whereby the judge adjudicates Praful to be imprisoned for 10 months, but she is released after 3–4 months due to good behaviour. Her ex-boyfriend Mike is also imprisoned for stealing her money and also for his sexual advance.

During a meeting session in prison, Praful tells her father that she wants to invest all his money into the stock market. Enraged by this, Praful's father becomes angry and grabs her neck angrily, venting his frustration that all his hard-earned money will blow up in smoke due to her crazy intentions.

The film ends with titles suggesting that Praful has been released from jail and she has sold the rights of her movie to be made to a Bollywood producer for fifty thousand dollars."

In another town, the woman's daughter, Sanjana, and her husband, Kabir, argue about not being able to celebrate her birthday together. Sanjana gets a call about her mother's accident and they quickly fly to Bangalore.

In Bangalore, Sanjana begins having visions that make her believe her dead conjoined twin's soul is after her. Her husband does not believe her and sends her to his former professor for spiritual healing.

During the treatment period, she tells the professor about how her conjoined twin sister Anjana always hated that Kabir liked Sanjana more than her. In fact, it was when Kabir told Sanjana that he was coming back home from abroad that Sanjana decided to separate from Anjana. It was during this operation that Anjana died, and Sanjana blames herself for her sister's death. The professor reassures Sanjana that her visions of Anjana are the result of her guilt and only a figment of her subconscious mind.

At her mother's place that night, Sanjana is forced into the outhouse by an unseen entity. Hearing noises, Kabir wakes up and finds her unconscious in the outhouse. When Sanjana awakes, she is possessed by Anjana's soul. After this, Sanjana/Anjana can't get enough of Kabir.

In self-defense, Sanjana hit Anjana on the head with a glass music box, killing her. Their mother covered the truth to protect her daughter. After consulting with the professor, they try to find and burn the last possession of Anjana and set her soul free.

Sanjana, Kabir, the caretaker, and her daughter-in-law all follow the music leading to the outhouse. Under the floor, they find Anjana's corpse. The caretaker and her daughter-in-law go inside to get kerosene with which to burn the body. They both die at the hands of Anjana's soul. The professor arrives at the outhouse with kerosene, but is possessed by Anjana and tries to attack Sanjana. While Kabir fights him, he finds the locket he gave to Sanjana when they were young on Anjana's corpse. When he confronts Sanjana, she confesses that she is actually Anjana. She tells him that she killed Sanjana with the music box and took her sister's place so she could be with Kabir. Outraged, Kabir decides to leave her despite her pleas that she loves him. Sanjana (now revealed to be Anjana) hits him on the head with a chair to stop him from leaving and he falls. Anjana tries to kill Kabir with a pair of scissors but is stopped by Sanjana's soul, the burning roof falls on Anjana thus killing her and professor saves Kabir.

A poison gas attack on a Kolkata Metro Rail compartment kills all the passengers on board. Two years later, Vidya Bagchi, a pregnant British-Indian software engineer, arrives in Kolkata from London during the Durga Puja festivities in search of her missing husband, Arnab Bagchi. A police officer, Satyoki ""Rana"" Sinha, offers to help. Although Vidya claims that Arnab went to Kolkata on an assignment for the National Data Center (NDC), initial investigations suggest that no such person was employed by the NDC.

Agnes D'Mello, the NDC's head of human resources, suggests to Vidya that her husband resembled former employee Milan Damji, whose file is probably kept in the old NDC office. Before Agnes can provide any further help, she is killed by Bob Biswas, an assassin working undercover as a life insurance agent, at the entrance of her house. Vidya and Rana break into the old NDC office and find Damji's file, barely escaping an encounter with Bob, who is sent to search for the same information. Meanwhile, the attempts to obtain Damji's records have attracted the attention of two Intelligence Bureau officials in Delhi—the chief Bhaskaran K. and his deputy Khan. Khan arrives in Kolkata and reveals that Damji was a rogue IB agent responsible for the poison gas attack. Despite Khan's warnings, Vidya continues her search, fearing that Arnab's resemblance to Damji may have led him into trouble.

The address on Damji's record leads Vidya and Rana to a dilapidated flat. An errand boy from the neighbourhood tea stall identifies R. Sridhar, an NDC officer, as a frequent visitor to Damji's flat. Bob attempts, but fails, to kill Vidya and is soon run over by a truck during a chase. Examination of Bob's mobile phone leads Vidya and Rana to an IP address, sending instructions to kill her. They break into Sridhar's office to verify his IP address, but he is alerted electronically and returns to his office. Vidya accidentally kills Sridhar during a scuffle, which upsets Khan, who had wanted him alive.

Sridhar's computer data reveals a code, which when deciphered reveals Bhaskaran's phone number. Vidya calls Bhaskaran to tell him that she has retrieved sensitive documents from Sridhar's office. She asks Bhaskaran to help find her husband in exchange for the documents, but Bhaskaran tells her to contact the local police. Vidya soon gets a call from an unknown number, warning her that she should hand over the documents to the caller if she wishes to see her husband alive. Khan thinks the caller is Damji.

Vidya goes to meet Damji at the designated location as told in the phone call, followed by Rana and Khan. Damji cuts the meeting short when Vidya expresses her doubt that he will be able to return her husband in exchange for the sensitive file, and he attempts to leave. Vidya tries to stop him, and in the ensuing struggle, Damji draws a gun on her. Vidya disarms him using the prosthetic belly she has been using to fake her pregnancy and promptly stabbing him in the neck with her hairstick before finally killing him with his own gun. She flees into the crowd before the police arrive, leaving a thank-you note for Rana and a pen drive containing data from Sridhar's computer, which leads to Bhaskaran's arrest. Rana concludes that neither Vidya nor Arnab Bagchi ever existed and that Vidya had been using the police and the IB to achieve her own ends.

Vidya is revealed to be the widow of Major Arup Basu, an IB and Army officer and Damji's colleague, who was killed in the poison gas attack, which also caused Vidya to fall unconscious upon seeing her husband's corpse and suffer a miscarriage. In her mission to avenge his and their unborn child's deaths, Vidya was helped by the retired IB officer, Col. Pratap Bajpayee, who suspected the involvement of a top IB official."

Somewhere in a Taliban camp in the Dasht-e-Madar desert, in Afghanistan, ISI official Col. Huzefa is interrogating a captured man presumed to be a RAW agent. The man gives details of RAW's operations in Afghanistan in exchange for money and safe passage across the border. In doing so, he betrays his colleague, Major Rajan, who has also infiltrated the camp. This is, however, revealed to be a ruse, as both overpower their captors and fight their way out of the camp. Along the way, they rescue a girl called Farah, who was being held hostage.

Later, the captured man who escaped with Rajan is revealed, in New Delhi, to be Agent Vinod, who is shown a video message recorded by Rajan from Russia mentioning '242' just moments before being shot dead and tasked by RAW chief Hassan Nawaz to find out what '242' is. Vinod travels to St. Petersburg to intercept criminal don Abu Nazer and is almost captured, but manages to escape killing Abu in the process and goes to Tangier, Morocco. He assumes the identity of Freddie Khambatta and meets the Russian mafia boss David Kazaan and his personal Pakistani doctor, Ruby Mendes. Vinod manages to convince Kazaan that he is indeed Freddie and hacks his phone. He gets closer to Ruby to find out what '242' is and finds out that her name is actually Iram Parveen Bilal, and she is a British-Pakistani working undercover for the ISI. He obtains an invitation card for a private auction and learns that many international businessmen, some of them terrorist groups, are converging at an antiques auction in Marrakesh to purchase '242'.

At the auction, Vinod learns that '242' is actually the detonator for a nuclear device, and runs into businessman and philanthropist Jagdishwar Metla, with whom he has a disturbing conversation. A bidding war ensues, and Kazaan manages to secure the detonator through his Russian girlfriend. Eventually, when ISI chief Col. Iftekhar Ahmed is later shot dead in Pakistan by Col. Huzefa moments after being informed of a few defectors, it turns out that a group of rogue ISI colonels, including Huzefa, is planning a nuclear attack on India. Back in Morocco, Kazaan locks the detonator with a password, and hands it over to the mysterious 'Colonel', who has arrived in Morocco. Iram finds out that Vinod is a RAW agent and both agree to work together to prevent the nuclear device from falling into the wrong hands. 'Colonel' captures Ruby and asks her to reveal the whereabouts of Vinod; he then blackmails Vinod's contact into deceitfully retrieving the detonator and later has him killed before Vinod, who realizes the betrayal, can question him at gunpoint. Shortly afterwards, he is attacked and admitted to a hospital. He clears his way out of the hospital to find Iram. 'Colonel', now having the detonator, reaches Riga, Latvia to acquire the bomb. He is joined by rogue mercenary Jimmy, who is to detonate the bomb.

'Colonel' enlists Iram to help his men transport the bomb out of Latvia and tries to kill her, but fails. Vinod and Iram join hands again and try to capture the 'Colonel' and the bomb and reach Karachi, where they bump into Farah as she gets them access inside a function attended by Col. Pasha, only for Vinod and Iram to be captured by Col. Huzefa and nevertheless manage to escape. Meanwhile, elsewhere, the house of an old man known only as 'Professor', who has links to 'Colonel', is infiltrated by the RAW team with Iram visiting in the name of 'Colonel'; despite 'Colonel' leaking her allegiances to him, when 'Professor' tries to kill Iram, he is neutralized by a team of special forces soldiers. Later, while putting two and two together through artifacts recovered from 'Professor' at his house, they learn of a plot to smuggle the nuclear device from Karachi into India, via the sea route, and learn that the target of the bomb is New Delhi. They make it to Delhi, where Jimmy has already reached, and try to locate the bomb, but fail when Jimmy sets off a grenade and Vinod loses him in the fracas. Iram runs into 'Colonel', disguised as a pilot, again when she bumps into Metla and is fatally shot, but points him out to Indian security forces, who spring into action when he holds Metla at gunpoint; Metla manages to free himself from 'Colonel', and in a shootout, his head is chopped to pieces by the helicopter blades. Eventually, Vinod successfully tracks down the bomb to a restaurant, strategically killing Jimmy, and takes it up in an NSG helicopter to detonate it as far away from the city as possible since nobody knows the password; he asks Hassan to connect him to Iram, who is being treated for her gunshot wounds. Iram realises the password to the detonator was set by Kazaan and asks Vinod to try the name of Kazaan's camel - ""Zilleh"". The bomb is successfully defused, though Iram succumbs to her gunshot wounds.

Vinod meets up with Hassan, who informs him of a flashdrive recovered from 'Colonel'; he later visits Metla, revealing to him that he knows Metla has had a hand in the conspiracy as its mastermind since he had struck a deal with 'Colonel' to earn the Zeus Group millions of dollars and orchestrated the nuclear attack for his own benefit; Metla, however, mocks him, claiming geopolitical affairs like these are too complex for ""lowkey"" officers like him to understand. Unbeknownst to Metla, Vinod is secretly recording the conversation through a wire, with the Lashkar-e-Taiba's London cell listening in since minutes before their meeting. Realizing that they have been manipulated into almost starting a war with India, with the Pakistani government cracking down on them, the cell sends a suicide bomber to assassinate Metla at a function in his honour, even as Vinod proclaims to Metla that he must die ""like a hero"". Metla is killed, but posthumously feted as a great philanthropist. Later, on a beach in Cape Town, the Russian woman who first acquired the nuclear device is seen sunbathing; she looks up to find Vinod smiling at her, indicating he has moved on to his next mission."

Ashok and Kumar are best friends. Shanaya and Mishti are their love interests. Ashok's father is a billionaire but has been in a coma for the last six years. During these years, Ashok's maternal uncle, Kunwar Amar Nath Singh (KANS Mama) has been in charge of his family property. Having enjoyed the money, Mamaji does not want to give up that money to Ashok, who is now old enough to take over. So the evil Mamaji teams up with an evil doctor and chemist, Dr. Khan, to get rid of Ashok (without murder) and keep control of his property. Dr. Khan gives Mamaji a medicine called MAD (Mind Altering Drug) which makes one act and speak like a dog for 36 hours. At first, Mamaji is reluctant and angry at Dr. Khan. But Mamaji then sees the medicine work on Dr. Khan’s 2 assistants and agrees.

Towards this end, during a board meeting, Mamaji mixes the medicine in Ashok and Kumar's drinks, and they both start behaving like dogs. The men-behaving-like dogs are taken to a mental asylum for treatment. In the asylum, the lady doctor, Dr. Shivani, soon realizes the truth and promises to discharge them. But fate takes an even stranger twist because, in the same asylum, there are two identical lookalikes of Ashok and Kumar who are being treated in the 'B' ward. The lookalikes worked at an Indian food stall which was a front for Bijlani, a cocaine smuggler. One day Bijlani delivered a jar of cocaine to Ashok and Kumar mistaking that for flour used it for preparing parathas thereby making the customers go crazy. As a punishment, Bijlani gave them both severe electricity shocks thereby both losing their mental balance and were admitted to the asylum. These lookalikes are accidentally released instead of the real Ashok and Kumar. Shanaya and Mishti, who come to pick up their boyfriends from the asylum, take away the duplicates instead, without realizing anything. All of them go to Ashok's mansion. Here, Mamaji understands the whole mix-up and plans to use the duplicate Ashok to become the owner of the whole business empire.

By now, the true Ashok and Kumar also come to know of Mamaji's evil plan, but they are still stuck in the asylum. They are offered help by one of the ward boys, Cyrus, who takes them to a secret ward 'C' to meet 'Johnny' who is (by another coincidence or twist of fate) a look-alike of Mamaji. Johnny has a strange, dangerous habit of attacking people who sneeze in front of him. Ashok and Kumar plan revenge against Mamaji with the help of his lookalike, Johnny. However, they get caught by the asylum's sadistic warden, Y.M. Raj (a supposedly funny play on ""Yamraj,"" the god of death) before they can escape from the asylum. Y. M. Raj prepares to punish them, but he accidentally sneezes in front of them. Angered by this, Johnny beats him black and blue, thus helping the three escape.

On the day of the board meeting, the true Ashok and Kumar get ready to expose Mamaji, when Dr. Khan triggers the fire alarm. All the three mental patients escape the building. Now desperate, Ashok and Kumar bump into a dance bar owner named Balbir, who (by another coincidence) is a lookalike of Mamaji. Mamaji now does something innovative: he arranges another set of Ashok and Kumar with the help of plastic surgery from Dr. Khan's two assistants who assume their identities. He takes the triplicate Ashok and Kumar to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, where the fake (triplicate?) Ashok is to hand over all the business to him (Mamaji) in the presence of Prince Charles. However, the real Ashok and Kumar arrive, along with Balbir (who is Mamaji-III). To add to the confusion, the three mental patients also storm in to help the real Ashok and Kumar, creating panic among the eyewitnesses on seeing so many lookalikes together.

The film closes with Ashok's father coming out of his coma and recognizing the true Ashok and getting Mamaji arrested for his deeds."

Rani grew suspicious when she heard her son's phone ring in Arjun’s pocket, as he had forgotten to get rid of it. Though Arjun and Naina managed to escape, they were worried they'd eventually be found out.

Naina later saw news reports accusing Sunny of embezzling money from the bank where he worked before disappearing. She realised that Arjun had taken Sunny’s wallet and used his girlfriend’s credentials to hack the bank and frame Sunny. Rani eventually identified Naina’s car at the scene of her son’s disappearance, but Naina's lawyer falsified an alibi. Although the police accepted it, Rani wasn't convinced. She confronted Naina at a public event, begging her to reveal Sunny's whereabouts, but Naina kept up her lie. Months later, she and Arjun were contacted by a blackmailer, leading to the events that got her arrested.

Badal theorises that Rani killed Arjun, with Nirmal’s help since he worked at the hotel. Naina admits she saw Rani in the room but had lied to test Badal’s competence. Badal then reveals that there was no witness—he had made it up to get the truth from her. Now trusting him, Naina confesses a dark secret: Sunny had still been alive in the trunk when she dumped the car, but she chose to let him die to avoid getting caught. Shocked by her actions, Badal suggests that Naina, not Arjun, orchestrated the cover-up and framed Sunny. He speculates that Arjun, overcome with guilt, went to the hotel to confess to Rani and Nirmal, and Naina killed him to keep the truth hidden. Naina denies this, insisting that her earlier story is the real one.

Badal refuses to defend Naina any further unless she admits to killing Arjun. Naina finally confesses, revealing where Sunny’s body is hidden. Badal agrees to continue helping her, but steps outside for a moment. Meanwhile, Naina receives a call from Jimmy and notices that Badal’s pen is disrupting the signal. Realizing something is wrong, she discovers that the man posing as Badal was an imposter when the real Badal Gupta arrives at her door. Horrified, Naina disassembles the pen, revealing a hidden voice recorder with her confessions. She looks out the window and sees the imposter and Rani in the apartment across from hers. The man posing as Badal removes his disguise, revealing himself as Nirmal. Rani then calls the police to have Naina arrested."

In the early 1980s, a day before her marriage, Reshma, a young girl runs away from her rude mother and village in rural Tamil Nadu and reaches Madras, hoping to become a star in Tamil cinema. She starts staying at a house located in a poor area near a single woman named Ratnamma who operates an eatery where Reshma works. Since Reshma had been raised up as a tomboy, many people seek her for her charm. Though she goes on auditioning for roles, she fails to land an opportunity. A casting director insults her for being unattractive, and gives her money for food seeing her starving condition. That night, she is invited by her neighbour to go to a movie theatre with him to watch her childhood idol Suryakanth in action. There, the man inappropriately touches her & offers 20 rupees to sleep with him. Though she storms out of the theatre in tears, she later ponders over it and determined to secure a role, visits the sets again. She spontaneously auditions for the position of a background dancer. However, she dances in a sultry manner, using erotic movements which the assistant director found attractive. But when the film's director, Abraham comes back to the set that day and sees the dance footage, he is extremely disgusted seeing her erotic dance. He edits out Reshma's entire dance sequence. Reshma and Ratnamma eagerly go to watch the movie but are crestfallen to see that her dance has not been featured in the film. The film fails at the box office in spite of being highly praised by critics, much to the dismay of the producer Selva Ganeshan, who later recalls Reshma's performance footage and includes that song in the re-release at B and C centres. The film goes on to attract large crowds due to Reshma's dance moves, despite being heavily criticised by reviewers. Just as Reshma, disheartened that her song was edited out, decides to pack up and go back to her village, producer Selva Ganeshan finds her dwelling place and offers her a role in a song in his upcoming film. Selva also suggests that she now be referred to as ""Silk"", which sounds more exotic and captivating.

At the first shoot, Silk dances with the actor Suryakanth, her childhood idol. Enamored with him, Silk gains his affection and attention by offering a long-term extra-marital sexual relationship. Meanwhile, Abraham proposes a new film to Selva Ganeshan and is keen to cast Suryakanth. However, Suryakanth's suggestion of adding sex and eroticism alongside a dance featuring Silk, to make the film more commercially viable, angers Abraham, causing him to part ways with Silk. Silk slowly builds a name for herself in the industry with her erotic dance moves and goes on to do many more sexually charged films with Suryakanth, which catapults her into stardom. She gains many male fans who buy movie tickets only to enjoy her dances and, in a short time, becomes immensely rich and popular as a sex symbol.

Suryakanth's younger brother Ramakanth, a scriptwriter by profession, is a secret fanboy of Silk and starts to befriend her. Silk secretly moves away from Suryakanth & develops a liking for Ramakanth after she realizes that he is the first man who loves her for more than just her body and sex appeal & that Suryakanth will never abandon his wife to marry her. Silk visits her hometown with Ramakanth and is happy to see the crowd gathering around to see her, but is left heartbroken when her mother slams the door in her face without greeting her. At an awards ceremony Silk is insulted by Suryakanth who whispers to her that she is nothing more than everyone's ""dirty secret"". Hurt by his remarks, Silk delivers her award receiving speech in which she criticises the misogynistic double standards of the society which names & shames women acting in erotically charged films but not the men who produce, distribute, consume & spread those same material. She declares that she will continue to make her ""dirty pictures"" until the society changes its views. Silk's relationship with Ramakanth is released to the public after noted journalist Naila criticizes her for having a romantic relationship with both brothers. To seek revenge, Suryakanth drops Silk from his forthcoming films, forcing her to work with other filmmakers, who repeatedly typecast her as a seductress, which causes her to lose interest in her work & fall out with the directors. Now in the 90s, directors start to make the main actresses do the sultry dances instead of hiring dancers like Silk who specialised in such dance moves, causing shrinkage in her employability. By this time, Silk had also put on weight, losing her status as a sex symbol & begins to feel threatened by a younger aspiring actress, Shakeela. During a dance challenge in a party, she tries to outshine Shakeela by dancing more and more erotically and finally intentionally trips Shakeela, much to the embarrassment of Ramakanth who had been planning to introduce Silk to his parents as a prospective bride at that party. Silk & Ramakanth argue over this incident, during which she says that she isn't ashamed keeping her seductive image offscreen, which causes Ramakanth to break-up with her. To ease her heartbreak, Silk who had already been into drinking and smoking, turns to alcohol addiction and chain smoking & as a result begins to show symptoms of depression and obesity.

Silk now approaches Selva Ganeshan with an offer to produce a film together starring her in a triple role as a seductress. At the same time Abraham also directs a film starring himself in a triple role, containing commercial eroticism with Ramakanth as his scriptwriter. Both the films are released on the same day, & while Abraham's film becomes a commercial success, Silk's film drastically fails at the box office. He feels that he has finally proven to Silk (and himself) that he has defeated Silk. But Abraham begins to take a liking towards Silk even though he claims to hate her.

Having lost her fame and fortune Silk had accumulated so much debt (due to her addiction of placing bets on racing horses) that she was on the verge of homelessness. Out of desperation, she approaches a small-time filmmaker, willing to take on any role. He intoxicates her with alcohol and starts filming her in a hardcore pornographic film without her permission. The place is raided by the police & Silk manages to escape. In her intoxicated state, she has several visions of her past, encounters Ratnamma's shop on the way and tries to hide from being seen by her out of shame, realising that she had come back to the same position (as an object of lust) as she was before her film career began. Completely heartbroken and inundated with substance abuse, she reaches her house and cries out bitterly.

Abraham finds himself falling in love with Silk, even though he denies it at first, as he struggles with this moral dilemma. After coming to know about Silk's loneliness & loveless personal life, he goes to Silk's hometown and convinces her mother to accompany him to visit her at Madras. He tries to call Silk over phone in an attempt to surprise her but she doesn't pick up. When he finally got Silk on phone, Abraham becomes alarmed when she asks him to bid farewell to everyone for her. He rushes to her house and finds her lying in bed, dressed modestly in a red sari like a housewife (a role she had been denied in life), dead from a sleeping pill overdose, along with a suicide note written by her.

A tearful Abraham and Silk's mother cremates Silk's body. The film ends with Abraham's narration, examining the life that Silk has led, and he questions whether it was her or her life that was right or wrong. He also thinks that Silk must be right now creating an uproar in the other world as well, because that is her nature."

This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (September 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message)

The film is set in the fictional Indian city of Bharat Nagar which is considered an example of progress through infrastructure. The state government is planning to build an International Business Park (IBP), which is claimed to turn the city into 'Shanghai.'

The film starts with Bhagirath ""Bhaggu"" Dolas (Pitobash Tripathy) convincing his maternal uncle, Jagannath ""Jaggu"" Koli alias (Anant Jog) into performing an unknown task. Although unwilling, the latter takes it up fearing confiscation of his hypothecated vehicle due to possible issues in unpaid dues. Bhaggu then participates in the assault of a local bookstore owner who stocked copies of Dr. Ahmadi's (Prosenjit Chatterjee) latest book, which criticises Morcha, the local political party, for ignoring the plight of the poor in its quest for developing infrastructure. Ahmadi, a socialist academic, is scheduled to visit Bharat Nagar for a speech. Shalini (Kalki Koechlin), a former student of Ahmadi, is part of a small group that struggles to raise awareness against the much touted project, which could render many people homeless. Joginder Parmar alias Jogi (Emraan Hashmi) works in a photo and video studio of questionable repute with the owner, Vinod (Chandrahas Tiwari). T. A. Krishnan (Abhay Deol), an IAS officer, a favourite of the Chief Minister (Supriya Pathak), is assured by Principal Secretary Kaul (Farooq Shaikh) of a promotion and a trip to Stockholm.

Ahmadi arrives from New York City to find out that the required permissions for his speech have been revoked (due to Krishnan's influence) citing lower police protection. Before his arrival, Shalini gets a warning from Gauri, her maid, to stop him from coming to Bharat Nagar, but her words are not taken seriously by his associates. Jogi and Vinod are present at the Morcha party headquarters to shoot a promotional video on IBP featuring Janardhan Purshottamdas Sawant alias Deshnayak (Kiran Karmarkar), a local politician. On receiving a call, Deshnayak becomes flustered, and Damle, his aide, tells the duo to stop the shoot.

Meanwhile, Ahmadi finds a way to deliver a scathing speech against the establishment, which is received well. A mob later gathers and attacks his associates. On learning this, Ahmadi gets angry and starts shouting at the police officers managing the crowd. Unknown to the police, Jaggu's truck breaks in and runs over Ahmadi. One of Ahmadi's team members, Tiger, tries to intervene by jumping onto the truck and fighting Bhaggu, who was behind the truck. In the scuffle, Bhaggu is pushed off and manages to escape. Sometime later, Jaggu crashes his vehicle. This is noticed by a policeman nearby, and he is subsequently arrested. Jogi and Vinod were also present to cover Dr. Ahmadi's speech.

Ahmadi winds up comatose in a hospital. Shalini is confident that this was a planned attack. On seeing Jogi in the hospital, she asks him if they have any video footage of the crash, which could be used to find the perpetrators. Dr. Ahmadi's wife Aruna (Tillotama Shome) agrees to lead a media campaign demanding the truth, though she seems uninterested. Bhaggu meanwhile manages to free his uncle from prison.

Back in the studio, during a conversation with Jogi, Vinod claims to have incriminating evidence against Morcha and wishes to sell Shalini the tape. Meanwhile, Aruna's campaign forces the CM's office to set up an inquiry commission headed by Krishnan. Krishnan finds that the police are hiding evidence, so he summons SSP Chavan (Chinmay Mandlekar), who is also uncooperative. Shalini, who attends the commission snaps at Krishnan for allegedly taking it lightly, following which she is barred from attending any future hearings. Jogi, desperate to sell the tape futilely approaches Krishnan but is later approached by Shalini.

Shalini meets Vinod but leaves when Vinod says that he won't give the video for free. While she changes her mind later at night, she calls Jogi, who is shown to be in an ambulance with Vinod's wife, but in vain. Vinod is found dead in what looks like a road accident. At a later Morcha rally where Jogi is in the ambulance with Vinod's corpse, Damle approaches him and mentions the tape, subtly threatening him. Though initially reluctant, Jogi promises to help Shalini and Tiger in finding the evidence. He then attends a rally held by Deshnayak, on the occasion of his birthday. The three then rummage through the footage to find the conspirators, compile a CD and hand the evidence to Krishnan. In one of Deshnayak's rallies, Bhaggu and his uncle approach Damle over not releasing the truck involved in the accident, not paying Bhaggu's fees for his English classes, and not answering his calls. An irate Bhaggu threatens to spill the beans over Dr. Ahmadi's murder, following which Damle promises to sort everything out.

After viewing the evidence on the CD, Krishnan sends out a summons to Deshnayak, who rejects it in a public rally (where Bhaggu approaches Damle) sparking riots in the city. Shalini visits Jogi who is about to leave town. Meanwhile, Morcha thugs attack the studio while trying to search for Jogi. Jogi and Shalini manage to escape and hide on the roof until morning. In the chaos of the riots, Bhaggu, who is a part of the instigators is later found dead, ostensibly killed by Damle's men over the spat over releasing Jaggu's truck.

Shalini receives a panicked call from Gauri, who says that her family is in danger. Shalini and Jogi sneak over to Gauri's place, where it is revealed that Jaggu is Gauri's father. An angry Shalini starts beating Jaggu, who later opens up about the events of the crime. Jogi then remembers that Vinod had kept a backup of the incriminating tape, and sneaks back to the studio to get it. Krishnan meets with the Chief Minister about the inquiry. Jogi finds the CPU amid the studio's wreckage and has a narrow escape from the thugs chasing him. They all show Krishnan the video, which establishes that Deshnayak conspired to have Ahmadi killed and the Chief Minister was complicit in this plan.

The Chief Minister, buoyant because she has an opportunity to eventually become Prime Minister, presents Krishnan with the approval of his Stockholm trip, and a promotion. She also asks Krishnan to stop the probe and hand over all his findings to the CID of the State Police, which shall now investigate the case further. However, after seeing the evidence, Krishnan confronts Kaul with the truth, who then threatens to ruin Krishnan's career. Undeterred, Krishnan blackmails him, until Kaul finally leaves to talk to the Home Minister's secretary. In the hospital, Ahmadi's family decide to take him off life support.

An epilogue explains the fate of the major characters: Krishnan refused the chance to go to Stockholm to ensure that a national investigation is opened up as per his plan. Jogi escaped Bharat Nagar as a pornographer but is declared untraceable by the police. Shalini wrote a book about the conspiracy, which is banned in India. In the closing scene, a poster is shown carrying Aruna's picture with the slogan, ""Chief Minister for all, IBP for all,"" implying that she is contesting for the CM's designation, and supports the IBP project. Jaggu is shown operating a bulldozer for demolishing old homes to make way for the business park. As Jaggu prepares to demolish the house, Dr. Ahmadi is shown turning toward him, which signifies Jaggu's trauma after the accident or the academic's futility in stopping the project."

A few days later, Soni is brought back into the police after Kalpana's intercession. The two later go to a restaurant to relax. Soni goes to the ladies washroom, which has been occupied by a group of young men who are consuming drugs. She gets into a fight with them and injures her hand before they are arrested. One of the men is found to be the son of a minister's friend.

After the incident, Sandeep scolds Kalpana, holding her responsible for the fight. The arrested men are released immediately, while Soni is taken off duty and sent back to the control room. Kalpana on the other hand realizes that Soni is right and arrests the minister's friend's son knowing the consequences."
