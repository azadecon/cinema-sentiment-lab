Delhi-based school backbenchers Vikas ""Hunny"" Gulati and Dilip ""Choocha"" Singh are perpetually dreaming of making it big and want to get into the local college but don't have the required grades. The college guard Pandit tells them that he can provide them with the leaked class XII papers for a large sum of money. Choocha has the power to get the winning number of any lottery in his dream, and Hunny has the talent to sand the exact number out of his dream. They cannot afford or collect the money required, so they decide to sell the papers to other students but fail there too. Meanwhile, through Pandit, they meet Zafar, a former student of the college and a struggling musician. The fourth character is Lali, whose father Billa runs a sweet shop. Lali is currently pursuing his degree through correspondence and, like Hunny and Choocha, also wants to get into the same college, where his girlfriend Shalu, who ignores him all the time, studies. Pandit asks Lali to donate ₹250,000 in the college development fund to get admission, but Billa refuses to, saying college is too costly. Zafar's girlfriend, Neetu, who has broken up with him over his career choices, is now giving private tuition to Lali so that he can get the marks to get into the college of his dreams. On the other hand, Zafar's father faces a stroke and is paralysed. Zafar badly needs money for his treatment.

The four meet up at Pandit's office, where Hunny explains his scheme. However, since now they all together need a lot of money, they need someone to invest their money. On Zafar's insistence, Pandit is talked into taking them to meet a local gangster, Bholi Punjaban, where Hunny tells them their scheme. Bholi is ready to invest, and Lali also gives his shop papers as a mortgage. Bholi tells them to come the next day with the number. However, the same night, everyone except Choocha falls asleep. The next morning, Choocha narrates a fake dream, which Hunny interprets and gets a number. They go to Bholi and tell the number, but it backfires, and Bholi loses her money. Now to recover her money, she gives them a packet containing drug pills, which Zafar, Hunny, and Lali have to sell at a rave party the same night. She keeps Choocha as security with her. At the party, police and the Narcotics division conduct a raid, and Lali escapes with a packet with the police chasing him. Lali manages to fool the cops and reaches Neetu's place. He also sees Zafar there. Neetu throws the drugs down the drain just as the police are about to search her home. The cops leave her place, warning Lali. Meanwhile, Zafar tells the whole story to Neetu, and he was thinking that Neetu was falling for him, but she refuses. Zafar also warns him. Lali also calls Choocha, telling him to run from Bholi's house, which he succeeds in doing.

The next morning, all five of them land up at Bholi's place. She gives them 24 hours to pay all the money due; otherwise, she would take the money by selling Lali's shop. The four are fighting at Zafar's place, where Choocha tells them the truth about not seeing the dream. However, he says to them that he slept last night, and he saw a dream. Zafar is not interested, while Lali, Hunny, and Neetu are. Hunny interprets the dream, but they are short of cash even after Neetu is ready to give her savings. However, next morning Lali is able to borrow some money from a homeless man who used to remove parts from Lali's motorcycle. They invest and win a huge amount. They go to Bholi's house and give her the money. Hunny tells Bholi that he wants to sell the drug pills again and gives her an advance. Impressed, Bholi goes inside and returns with the pills, only to be caught red-handed by the police and Narcotics Division, who have raided her home. While Hunny, Choocha, Lali, and Neetu were investing the money, Zafar met the Narcotics Division and made a plan to catch Bholi and also called Neetu, Lali, Choocha, and Hunny, where they confessed to the police. Now with Bholi behind bars, the police pardon the four, and they are free.

Three months later, it is shown that Hunny and Choocha have become rich and are entering the same college on horses as they had planned at the beginning of the film, while Pandit is shocked to see them. Lali is making new girlfriends. Priya reunites with Honey, and Neetu gets engaged to Zafar. Lali, Zafar, Neetu, and Priya are having a good laugh.",4410,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt2806788.srt","Loafers, wasters, bums,

My father says...
'son, you hold your destiny
in your own hands.'
But if I go by his words,
which I seldom do, then by God...
my destiny is fast asleep!
Do colleges also have morning assembly?
No man.
Only school teachers are obsessed
with morning assembly and uniforms.
College is all about scoring girls.
You're right man.
In government schools,
it's guys chasing guys!
You know Amit from the 12th grade?
Yeah.
He was in the toilet yesterday
with Rahul during assembly.
Are you serious?
Of course!
We'll walk hand in hand,
we'll walk hand in hand,
We'll walk hand in hand someday;
Dude, we can easilyjump over this wall.
Why break our backs over this stupid hole?
Choocha!
We have only a couple
of days of school to leave our mark behind.
That's all we've been doing
for the past two years.
Trust me, this year we will graduate!
I swear on your mother!
Dude, is it difficult to bunk
lectures in college?
No man.
You can do anything you want.
Study if you want to,
otherwise forget it.
Lounge in the canteen, hang around...
take in the scent of beautiful girls...
try and score with them...
kiss them anytime, anywhere...
no one bothers.
Sounds exciting!
Dude we're going
to college together!
I'll become someone's boyfriend
on the very first day.
Hello May Day...
Attention... the wall is about
to be breached!
Fire!
Dear god, you are the almighty.
You know everything there is to know...
but I'd like to remind you once again.
Please get me migrated into
Shalu's college this year.
It didn't happen last year, but this year
please make it happen.
I will offer prayers daily.
Please, God.
Bishop College.
Just reminding you since there are
so many colleges.
Bachelor of Commerce, 2nd year.
Give him your exam roll number as well.
Sir...
there was a cooking gas cylinder
along with these milk cans...
now its gone.
Did you see anyone take it?
No, brother, I don't drink milk.
In college, the girls will be...
Shut up, Choocha!
Stop sucking up.
Or I won't go with you.
Sorry bro.
Just that I'm really excited.
We'll sort you out,
but for now, be quiet.
Okay...
I am sure it will be fun.
Stop...
look...
Sardarji, want to buy a gas cylinder?
Half price!
What are you staring at?
I found it on the street.
Cylinder?
Yeah.
You found it?
Yeah.
On the street?
Yeah.
I'll beat the crap out of you.
You bloody dope head...
selling my own cylinder back to me?!
Whoa... I'm not a thief.
I found it on the street.
How does it belong to you?
I'll tell you!
Okay... fine...
you can keep it.
As a gift.
I am very rich anyway.
All my money's gathering dust...
Just leave.
Sardarji...
how about a plate of chole-bhatura?
Can't you hear my stomach growl?
Chotu...
give him a serving of chole-bhatura.
Here you go.
Dumbass, can't you serve properly?
You think I'm a homeless beggar?
What the...
You think this is your father's wedding
reception to feed him for free?
Why don't you slice me up
and add me to his dish?
You think this is a soup kitchen?
Hello?
In five minutes.
I'll be there.
Now he's got angels falling for him
where are you off to?
Dad, that was Raju.
He's clearing our dues today.
Did Raju rob a bank last night...
that he wants to clear our dues?
You think I'm an idiot?
He really called me,
I'll see you later.
What a bad start to the day.
I can't even set my beard!
10 more seconds and
I'd have taken the bus.
have I ever been late?
You know what my dad's like.
He can't set his beard unless
he yells at me every morning.
How was the movie yesterday?
It was okay.
You never take me along
with your college friends.
I'm in college too.
You aren't in college,
you're studying through correspondence.
It's the same thing.
Anyway, I'm coming to
your college next year.
So hang with us next year then.
You've become very rude lately.
Never mind.
You'll show me around
your college today?
I've been asking you for so long.
Say something.
Fine!
Only if Pandit lets us go.
Who is Pandit?
What's up, Panditji?
Nothing new...
it's the same grind everyday.
I'm stuck in his shithole
for other reasons
or I would've quit this job long ago.
You see this room?
Back home the bull knocks up cows
in a room bigger than this.
You're right, Panditji.
My dad said the same thing
to my mom.
Anyway, tell me something...
how much do we have to score
to make it to college?
At least, 85 %
You must be kidding!
You are kidding yourself
to even think about college.
All year round you make
life hell for others.
Now it's your turn to feel the heat.
There is another way in...
if you want, I can pull some strings.
Panditji, any way will do.
We'll tear through the roof,
if necessary.
Tell us what you can do.
Exam papers for the 12th grade are out.
What do you mean out?
Out, Choocha, out!
When he says they're out,
he means they've been leaked.
Holy shit Panditji!
Please do something for us.
Consider it done.
Come here a day before every exam.
50,000 rupees
for every exam paper.
Fifty?!!
That's too much!
I'm charging others 60,000.
This is a discount for you.
Why? Do you fancy us, or what?
He's so vulgar!
Shut up!
Panditji, you'll give us
the real papers right?
My papers will have better
printing than the real ones.
Get the money in place.
You only have a week.
Seven days only.
Get it?
Panditji, can we
walk around the college once?
I really want to go inside.
Never seen one.
Please don't say no.
Please, Panditji.
Come on Sunday
and I'll give you a tour!
Why? You want us to come and hang around
with the gardener's daughter?
Five minutes is all we want...
we'll be out in two!
Try to understand
you can't go in!
Panditji...
can he go in with me?
He's only going to drop me off, please.
Take.
Panditji, how could you let him in?
Even he doesn't study here...
But his girlfriend does.
Huh! She's not his girlfriend.
I've seen her with Monty
a lot of times.
Really? Monty?
Yeah.
You mean, cheating?
Shut it Choocha.
Panditji, please let us go in
or he won't stop until Sunday.
Please.
Okay, okay...
Listen, if anyone asks,
say that you are Zafar's cousins.
Is Zafar the big bully here?
Not a bull, but a cow.
He was the cool dude some years ago,
but is lying low now.
I pull strings for
people all the time...
but Zafar once pulled strings for me.
A star shines in my soul
And shows me the path
Shows me grace in an unfinished note
And
Lord, I can't take it anymore
Say something
Lord, open the doors of destiny
Please open them
Lord, I can't take it anymore
Say something
Lord, open the doors of destiny
Please open them
All my dreams
Are shut in a box
Lord, make a hole in that box
Lord, I can't take it anymore
Say something
Lord, open the doors of destiny
Please open them
Dreams are bubbling in my eyes
They speak to me every day
Dreams are bubbling in my eyes
They speak to me every day
They are in my eyes, in all I say
Yet so far from my reach
I've lost all patience
Give me some mantra
I've been vying for your
attention for so long
Lord, I can't take it anymore
Say something
Lord, open the doors of destiny
Please open them
Lord, I can't take it anymore
Say something
Lord, open the doors of destiny
Please open them
A star shines in my soul
And shows me the path
Shows me grace in an unfinished note
Let the tune be completed
A rhythm is at play
And melody flows
This continues
Sometimes with words, sometimes without
Our conversations, continue
A star shines in my soul
Dude!
You play the Violin just like
Shahrukh does in his films.
Fantastic!
There you go again making
a jerk of yourself!
It's a guitar, not a Violin!
Right?
Hunny, stop embarrassing me
in front of strangers, okay?
Whatever it is,
you are really good.
What course are you in?
I don't study here.
Oh, so you teach music?
Like Shahrukh Khan from
'Mohabbatein'?
Hey!
He doesn't teach here
and you don't study here.
Aren't your five minutes up yet?
We were just leaving, relax.
Before we leave,
won't you introduce us to Zafar?
Let's see what breed your cow is.
That's like asking if the sun is out
on a hot, sunny afternoon.
You are standing in his presence.
Him?
That's amazing, Panditji.
I've decided that as soon as we get
admission, I'm taking up the guitar.
Hunny, girls are crazy for guitarists!
Chicks will stick to you like magnets if
you've got a guitar.
Hey... time is up!
You better get the money in time.
You're top breed, for sure, brother!
Seven days only, get it?
So, Mr. Rockstar...
do you intend wasting your
talent over here?
When will you hit the big time?
Huh?
Album?
I'm asking because I'm worried about you.
I've known you for six years.
You rocked this place for the first three.
The other three I still don't understand.
Anything clicked yet?
No, Panditji.
They know my face so well at all the
auditions and reality shows...
they don't even let me in through the gate.
As for recording an album,
that's another ballgame altogether.
How could that be?
I mean, here you play so well.
I get your music, they don't?
It's not their fault.
These strings are tied to someone else.
When that person is away,
the music also goes away.
Touching.
I get what you're saying.
Keep playing.
If you need any help, let me know.
This is my new Visiting card.
Look...
it has my picture too.
What do you think?
Good.
Carry on... see you later.
Dude, I have a dream.
On our first day of college...
we will enter on horses.
You riding the white horse...
and I on the black...
wearing black sunglasses,
long leather boots with zippers...
red shirts and black pants.
Shirts buttoned up to the collar.
Dude, girls will kill for us.
That reminds me...
I forgot to tell you
about the dream I had this morning!
You jerk!
All you've done is talk nonsense all day...
missing out on what's really important.
As it is,
you've had a dream after bloody ages.
Sorry, dude.
The thing is I dream every night,
but sometimes I forget.
So anyway...
I saw, you were at the Jumbo Circus.
And a jumbo,
I mean an elephant goes wild...
and instead of playing with a colourful
ball, it takes you in its trunk...
and starts banging you on the floor.
That's when I get there
and rescue you from its trunk.
Then I wrap the trunk around my hand
and whack it with one blow.
Knock-out!
You bloody scoundrel...
elephants banging me on the floor,
horses dragging me...
next it'll be a donkey kicking me...
Smart ass, a little puppy
scares you to bits...
and you think you can whack an elephant!
Knock-out?!
Dude, you can't control what you
see in a dream.
A dream is a dream.
Anything is possible.
Anything is possible!
Shut up now!
Let me figure it out.
Mad elephant... elephant...
elephant as in Ganpati.
As in?
Lord Ganesha!
Lord Ganesha?
Bloody Englishman!
Indian Gods are so colourful!
Dude, don't confuse.
That was Lord Hanuman,
this is Lord Ganesha.
Hang on to Lord Ganesha.
Lord Ganesha...
also known as Shri Ganesh.
And 'a whack with the hand'...
a hand has five fingers...
five!
So it's number five on Shri Ganesh.
Let's go.
Here they come again.
A hundred tickets for Shri Ganesh,
number four.
Shri Ganesh... number four...
Do you have number four?
No.
Sorry, we're out of four.
In that case,
we'll go with number eight.
Number eight...
Do you have number eight?
No, out of eight too.
Really?
What do we do, Choocha?
Let's take number three.
Three?
No, I think we should go
with number five.
Screw what you think, let's go for three.
I don't get you...
Don't argue.
I want number three.
Oh no, number five.
Dude, shut up!
Why don't you get it?
Tell me, do you have number five?
This is not fair, Hunny.
Hey! I asked for number five,
not your daughter's hand in marriage.
Hurry up, it's almost time for the draw.
Scoundrels!
Pulled a fast one again!
Cut, cut...
Sorry.
Lucky 13...
Sir, sir...
the talkback is off...
Start!
What's wrong?
Even pirated CDs don't
get stuck like you do.
We've done 13 takes.
Lucky 13!
Get back in tune
and start singing.
Come on, start...
Sir, I can't do it.
Sir, I'm unable to sing.
Let's pack up for today.
Pack up?
If you're calling the shots here,
what do you want me for?
You think, I'm here for your autograph?
If you can't sing, get lost.
Out!
Call the percussionists in.
Let's see what they can do.
Listen Mr. Rockstar,
if you continue to sing like this...
very soon you'll be sporting wrinkles,
but your album won't see the light of day.
Now get lost!
Sir...
Yes?
Did you see anyone steal
my motorcycle tyre?
No brother, I'm not married.
You dopehead!
Stop right there!
Lali...
Although it's none of my business,
I'd like to tell you something.
Look I know you're hurt but...
it's not necessary that your school friends
remain friends in college too.
A lot changes when
you are in college.
You start a whole new life.
Ma'am, that doesn't mean you
give up on old friends for new.
No, not at all.
Friendship doesn't end
but priorities change.
Sometimes, a person's tastes also change...
I hope you understand
what I'm trying to say.
Take care.
Excuse me, ma'am!
I meant her.
Ma'am, don't you teach at BCMC?
Yes.
Ma'am, I want to transfer
to your college next year?
Good luck.
Sure, but what I mean is...
if you could teach me...
Me?
Take tuition classes.
I tried but all batches are full.
Moreover most of the syllabus
is completed.
So, how can I help?
Ma'am, don't you teach accountancy?
Yes.
I heard from Shalu.
Ma'am, I find accountancy tough.
I can't figure it out...
whereas, I've studied
all the other subjects.
Sorry, ma'am.
Ma'am, please ma'am.
Accountancy is very difficult.
Look, don't get me wrong.
I know why you are doing this...
don't rush into it.
No, ma'am, I'm not rushing.
Please, ma'am.
Alright...
we'll begin this evening,
at my place.
Will you manage?
Yes, ma'am, no problem.
Thank you, ma'am.
Listen, think about what
I was trying to tell you earlier.
It will help you.
See you.
I've thought about it...
I have a point to make.
When I go out with another girl
in the same college...
that's when she'll realise.
Today is your last day in school.
Your board exams begin in five days...
and today you'll get your
roll numbers.
Only those students whose attendance is
more than 75% will get their roll numbers.
There are two dimwits who won't get them.
Stand up as I call out your names.
Dalip Singh and Vikas Gulati.
Wow.
Standing up even before
your names are called.
Excellent!
Sumit, take this...
and distribute these roll numbers outside.
You two... come here.
Scoundrels, if you weren't attending
my tuition classes...
I'd have never given you your roll numbers.
Here.
Got my tuition fees?
Yes sir.
Put it here and get lost!
Sir, which college did you attend?
I mean, was attendance
compulsory there too?
Let me remind you, numbskull...
this is the year you make
a hat trick of failures.
You're thinking about college and...
I'm thinking about where I will
put you in this classroom.
Now get lost.
We shouldn't have given him the fees.
Now, how will we arrange the money
to pay for the question papers?
If we hadn't bought roll numbers off him, we
couldn't even have appeared for the exams.
And if you take that many days to come up
with a dream, how will I arrange the money?
Where is today's dream?
Dude, I dream every night but
I don't always remember it.
Remember that Hollywood film...
lnception?
The one with the 'Titanic' hero...
It was shown that they use needles
to get inside the brain.
Why don't you come up with
something like that?
Then you can poke some needles in me
and watch my dream with me.
It's not easy to remember my dreams.
Are you going to burn
a hole in the building?
You stroll by, to get close to me
Sometimes you look in my eyes,
sometimes you gaze at my walk
Ambarsariya, don't pick the bud unbloomed
Your mother's said the
harshest things to me
Ambarsariya, ho Ambarsariya
Dude. Your confidence
frightens me sometimes.
And your own face doesn't?
You can't be bird watching here.
Think about the exams!
We have five days to pay Panditji.
Another year we'll have to rot in school.
Shut up, you jinx!
Can't you be happy at my progress?
Yeah right!
Once in 1st grade,
twice in 6th grade...
and for the third bloody time in the 12th.
Progress!
Who fails in the 1st grade, man??
Will you be my friend?
If yes, then hold the kite up.
Ambarsariya, don't pick the bud unbloomed
Your mother's said the
harshest things to me
Ambarsariya
So, you want to be my friend?
If I didn't want to,
would I hold up the kite?
Yeah... but only friends, nothing more.
Don't ever say 'l love you' to me.
Of course not,
why would I say, 'l love you'?
You're not my girlfriend.
Anyway, I already have a girlfriend.
Really? What's her name?
First tell me yours.
Priya, now tell me her name.
Jasmine, she is in college.
She's a year older than me.
Actually, I have a thing for mature girls.
You get
to learn a lot from them.
Really? What mature things
has she taught you?
Well...
she taught me how to kiss.
What's there to teach in a kiss?
Not your regular kiss,
a mature kiss.
French kiss!
French kiss?
What's that?
You know what it is.
I really don't know,
tell me, please.
You put your lips together and...
What?
You put your lips together
and let your tongue do the magic.
That's French kiss.
So...
you've French kissed this girl?
Of course! Every time we meet,
we French kiss.
I don't want to be your friend,
you talk dirty.
Great.
You were the one who asked
what a French kiss was!
I don't care,
I don't want to talk to you, ever!
And if you ever come to the roof again,
I'll make sure my dad thrashes you.
Now that's what you call a crash landing!
Okay, so...
debit is what comes in,
credit is what goes out.
This is the basic rule
for all general entries.
Apply this rule and
make a general entry for Rent paid.
Ma'am, this is the only
entry I can't get right!
Write... rent debit, credit cash.
Ma'am, why do we credit cash?
When we get rent
shouldn't we debit it, instead?
This isn't the rent you get for
your shop.
This is the rent you
have to pay.
Oh! This is that one. Right.
Now I get it.
Now apply the basic rule to it.
Which rule?
What do you mean, which rule?
I just told you a minute ago.
Oh! That one...
Debit what comes in,
credit what goes out.
Yes, ma'am.
What's next?
Zafar, I know what music
means to you...
but you have other
responsibilities too, don't you?
Neetu?
I need your support...
not pressure, please!
Pressure?
Okay.
How much more time do you need?
Perfect!
Now you doubt me?
Listen, I didn't say that.
But this way it can go on forever, right?
Be practical, Zafar...
music is good as a hobby.
Music isn't my hobby, Neetu.
So what am l... your hobby or...
Oh come on, Neetu... seriously...
don't behave like a kid.
I'm not behaving like a kid,
but you sure are.
Tell me, music or me?
Neetu!
Music or me?
Music.
Remember one thing Zafar...
if you fail to make it as a musician,
I'll never forgive you.
Because you're sacrificing
our relationship for your music.
Remember this.
Find a fix, find a quick fix
Make a quick guess or hit bulls eye
Find a fix, find a quick fix
What's cooking, bro?
Nothing.
Sure seemed like something.
A little social service.
Exam papers for the 12th grade are out.
I wanted to line up my buyers before
I go buy them.
But they're all
a bunch of bloody losers.
That's true.
You also want papers?
No, no, I'm taking tuition classes.
Huh!
Like tuitions have ever helped anyone?
'I'm taking tuition classes.'
Actually, you're right.
Accountancy is like a
twisted pretzel for me!
I just don't get it.
But not for 12th grade,
I need papers for 1st year college.
Can I get them?
But aren't you studying
through correspondence?
So what?
It's the same thing.
College and correspondence
the same thing!
If it were the same, we'd be
Doctor Hunny and Choocha by now!
Tell me, please...
Dude, go and meet Panditji.
College and correspondence...
Who? The BCMC guy?
Yes, he can pull a lot of strings.
Meet him and say,
'Hunny referred your name.'
He will fix things for you.
Okay?
See you.
How much is it?
Never mind, brother.
Chotu...
64 rupees.
If you want to save yourself
if you want a future
From here and there, from anywhere
Grab what you can
You have to reach here.
Mr. Narayan Pandit,
from rags to riches.
How're you, Panditji?
Fine...
God's been kind.
What brings you here?
Hunny told me you leak exam papers.
What the...
Keep it down.
You're asking for papers
like they're candy!
Sorry.
Which grade?
Now don't keep it so low
that even I can't hear you.
Bachelor of Commerce,
first year, correspondence.
Only the accountancy paper.
I don't mess
around with the university...
But I can fix you up with something else.
As in?
You want admission in this college, right?
Yes!
I knew it.
I don't think you can get in on merit.
But if you donate 250,000 to the
President's fund, your seat is fixed.
President's fund?
Yeah... full guarantee.
I will get the form
signed and sealed, myself!
Listen carefully... seats are limited.
You delay and
you'll be hanging around for another year.
Okay?
Only two hundred and fifty thousand!
Two hundred and fifty thousand!
Two hundred and fifty thousand??
You son of a gun.
have you lost it?
Which college takes a fee of 250,000??
In my time we studied in makeshift
schools at a two and a half rupee fee...
that also sometimes we didn't pay.
250,000!
As it is nothing gets in
through your thick skull...
Forget bloody college
and sit here at the shop with me.
All he does is waste his time...
hanging out in college
or chasing girls.
And he wants, two hundred
and fifty thousand!
I can't help you.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
Someone will come...
Zafar...
I don't know how this happened...
he was perfectly fine
when he left home.
The doctor suggested that it's better
we admit him to a private hospital.
For that we need about 100,000 rupees.
And then some
more for treatment.
How will we manage that?
Take a look at him.
Here you go...
we've taken the blood sample.
You can submit the urine sample
at the desk outside.
Zafar...
my father thrust a
butcher's knife in my hand...
but your father won't do that to you.
Make music with your heart, not your mind.
Find a fix, find a quick fix
Make a quick guess or hit bulls eye
Find a fix, find a quick fix
if you want to save yourself
if you want a future
From here and there, from anywhere
Grab what you can
Find a fix, find a quick fix
The world doesn't rest on hope
The world rests on a quick fix
Up and down, everyone is a hustler,
A huge hustler, heavy hustler
You come make your mark too
Make your mark
Happy birthday, Pradhanji.
Welcome my dear Bombay princess!
Your timing is perfect.
I was just thinking about you.
Really?
I thought you were giving
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
Hello ma'am...
I love the way you play with words.
Strikes a chord every time!
Let's talk business.
Dimple has sprained her leg
and only you can dance like her.
I'll pay you well.
Set the stage on fire, today!
Hi sexy!
Are you out of your freaking mind?
Come on... you look like a bear.
By God, the audience won't enjoy it.
You want me to make
an ass of myself for your audience?
I'll pay you three thousand more for this.
Six!
Four!
Done deal, trim down the jungle.
Go... shave it off.
Dare you move!
Is it your father's bloody crop, you jerk!
Pradhan, you better step aside or...
I'll actually set fire to the stage!
Hey... listen to me.
Hunny...
how will we arrange the money?
Don't go!
Pradhan, I'll dance.
You
can even tweeze my eyebrows off.
Look at this.
Unnati, Unnati
Shake it baby, Unnati.
Your walk is sweet like sugar syrup
Unnati Oh, Unnati.
Shut up!
Let's go.
Pradhan, I'll dance better.
Dude...
our destiny isn't sleeping.
It's bloody dead!
Time flies
Catch up with it
Come on.
Get into someone's pockets
Or fall at someone's feet
if you want to save yourself
if you want a future
From here and there, from anywhere
Grab what you can
I always meant when I said that...
I don't guard a college,
but a treasure.
The first few months may look bleak, but
you'll see the results in a year or two.
Trust me, it's as good as a pension.
Hello Panditji.
How nice to see you, Sardarji.
You've come at the right time.
Would you like some tea?
Sure.
have a seat.
What have you decided?
Is it possible to get a discount?
How can I give a discount on
a discounted rate?
People are paying 350,000.
You can ask Zafar here.
What have you got to worry?
You're the only son of Mr. Billa,
the famous restaurant owner.
His one stir in his pot
will churn out 250,000!
He will stir fry me in
the same pot instead!
In that case,
enjoy your first and last cup of tea here.
Oh come on Panditji...
has anyone ever walked out
of here empty handed?
Your flattery won't help,
let's get straight to business.
You've got only three days to go,
have you managed the money?
The thing is Panditji...
we haven't got the money yet.
But I have a kick-ass idea.
I'll pay for all the
question papers in one go.
All I need is
someone to bankroll us.
I wouldn't even bankroll my own son.
No offence, but I'm sure your fathers
stand by your own father!
It's not a children's savings plan,
it's a business investment.
Really? What's this business
that I don't know of?
The thing is...
our Choocha is a golden goose...
every morning he lays a golden egg.
I mean, every night he has a dream.
The next morning I break that dream down
to a lottery number.
Hold on!
I take the world for a ride,
don't you try to hoodwink me!
Playing lottery is banned
in Delhi for 10 years.
Panditji...
you may be older,
but we are wiser.
You sit here in this cubicle, while we've
visited every nook and cranny in this city.
Delhi has four borders,
that's where lotteries are sold in bulk.
All you have to do is
mention our name there.
If it were a small amount,
we wouldn't bother you.
But this calls for millions.
Your investment, our skill...
profit for all, what say?
Listen, you day dreaming jerk...
I'll be right back with Zafar's stuff.
have your tea and get going.
Zafar, wait for me.
Trying to sell a dream to me.
Don't worry, Choocha.
Pandit's an idiot.
He'll regret this later.
Yuck, the miser hasn't even added sugar.
Can you please add some sugar, Choocha?
What are the returns like?
Brother, the more sugar you add,
sweeter the tea will be.
Absolutely!
100,000 will give you a million,
200,000 will give two million.
You want to invest?
No...
not me, but I know just
the person for that.
But...
But what?
You'll be asked for collateral.
Of course, we have no objection to that.
We have a necklace on us.
Was the tea too hot?
Panditji, where's
Bholi Punjaban these days?
What?
You heard right.
Move...
Zafar, are you crazy?
What have they brainwashed you with?
Don't fall into their trap.
They'd even sell their fathers.
Don't get into their mess.
I'm the one who is in need,
please take us to her.
Please.
Fine...
I'll take you to her
but 10% of the deal is mine.
Why don't you take it all and
turn this shithole into Taj Mahal?
Panditji, who is this birdie named
Bholi Punjaban...
whose feathers we haven't counted?
Birdie?
That's right!
I am a hustler.
Bholi only has an innocent sounding name.
The moment she speaks, it's as if
a tsunami has struck the river Yamuna.
Follow me.
Those deflated balloons on your roof
belong to your husband.
Your son stares at my chest all day...
with his tongue sticking out like a dog.
If you say another word,
I'll set two bulls free in your house...
will strip your whole
family down in public.
Oh God, she's made our lives hell here.
I think it's better to sell this house
and move away.
Fall prey to Bholi's abuses and...
your soul won't find a
hole to escape the body!
Put Jagbir on the job...
make sure they leave the house.
Yes, madam.
Bholi has got her hands
in every illegal business.
Yes? Hello?
Are you done?
How many parties?
Madam, two parties have
deposited 50,000 each.
More, more, call more or...
I'll make you dance until you're sore.
Yes, madam.
Mention Bholi's name
and politicians tremble in fear...
and the biggest of stars wet their pants.
Hello beauties,
did you get the payment?
No, madam.
He said he is the minister's P.A.
and he won't pay ever again.
Is that so? Dial him for me.
Hi, good afternoon.
I'm John Miller,
calling you from London and...
I'm glad to inform you that...
your email account has won
500,000 British Pounds.
Hello?
Say hello to your mom!
You may be the Minister's PA but
I don't give a damn.
Bholi...
you are going too far!
You won't get the payment.
Listen, the minister is in
a good mood today...
send some college girls over
to his farm house.
If the minister is in a good mood,
why don't you please him?
I'll send over some hot oil.
Get it?
First payment, then enjoyment.
Now hang up!
Here.
Bholi Punjaban isn't any little birdie,
she's a hawk.
The last nail in the coffin.
Ah!
Pandit, what a surprise!
haven't seen you in a while.
Hope you're not suffering
from some secret disease.
Of course not, Bholiji.
Actually, these days my wife
showers me with lot of love...
so I didn't feel the need to drop by.
So then, are you looking to adopt a girl?
Not at all.
These boys here have
an investment scheme.
Really?
I thought they're here to
propose marriage to me.
Listen, I don't deal with insurance agents
and bankers anymore.
They are not those guys...
Panditji, let it be.
I'll take over from here.
Madam, I am Hunny
and this here is Choocha.
What?
Dalip.
No, the other one?
Choocha.
Choocha?
Interesting.
And that's your captain?
No madam, I am the captain.
This is our coach, Zafar.
Shoot.
The thing is...
our friend Choocha here
has a God given gift.
He has a dream every night.
The next morning I use my God given gift to
break that dream down to a lottery number.
We buy a lottery of that number,
the number is drawn and...
we win, as simple as that.
Are you done?
No madam, not yet.
So madam, here's how it works...
when we play 220 rupees, we win 2,000.
When we play 2,200,
we win 20,000.
If we play 220,000,
we will win 2 million!
If you can lend us that 220,000,
we'll split the jackpot.
Moreover, you can have 250,000
from our share...
as an advance payment
towards the leaked question papers.
So, how do you like the plan?
I've come across a lot of
salesmen in my life...
but never one who sells dreams.
Trust me, madam.
Every time Choocha has
a dream we hit the jackpot.
You can check.
Even if I believe in what
you've just said...
what do you have as
collateral for my investment?
Bholiji, they have a necklace.
Do you?
Bloody worthless freeloader...
trying to pawn me
a fake necklace.
Disgusting!
How would I know?
Ever since I was a child,
my mom would wear this for functions...
and tell everyone,
'look at my expensive necklace'.
I did not know, I swear on her.
Great!
Like mother, like son.
What a fraud family.
Now get lost.
Bunch of losers.
What if I give you something
as collateral?
What the hell is happening here, Pandit?
You brought an entire gang?
Planning to get me busted?
No, Bholiji...
he had no idea
I was following them.
I came because
I need the money too.
If its okay,
I can get something for collateral.
You can shove all your
collaterals up your behind!
I will only invest for
something substantial.
How about the deeds to my shop?
Which shop?
Billa Sweet Shop.
You are Billa's son?
Yes, you know my dad?
Yes, very well.
Alright, see you tomorrow with the deed
and the lottery number.
Thank you, Bholiji.
Get one thing inside
your tiny little brains.
If my money goes down the drain...
I'll take back twice as much.
If that sounds good, come back tomorrow.
Otherwise, eat, drink and make merry.
I'm thinking, if we
double the investment...
we'll get 4 million,
instead of 2.
Two for us and two for Bholi.
Don't be greedy, Hunny.
It's a sure thing and we won't have
to go to her every time.
You think Bholi will agree?
Without a doubt!
So, even I will get 500,000 instead
of 250,000.
Yes, everyone will get 500,000.
Okay.
Wonderful!
I do all the hard work
and everyone else has all the fun.
You haven't slept yet?
Dude, I don't see your chole-bhatura
working on him.
The chole-bhatura from our sweet shop
could knock a horse out.
Dude, how's the lassi?
Wait a minute.
I hope he doesn't get knocked out so badly
that he doesn't remember the dream.
Don't worry, I've added a lot
of almonds in the lassi.
Watch how it makes his brain run.
Superb lassi, man.
Well done, Billa!
Now come on Choocha, go to sleep and
dream something nice and crispy.
Don't worry brother,
you'll be served something incredible.
Hunny, as soon as we get the money
I want to buy a pair ofjeans.
The kind that are ripped at the knees,
like Salman Khan wears.
And Fila shoes, with red soles.
Okay, I'll sleep.
No, not jeans...
I'll buy cargo pants
with multiple pockets.
And in every pocket bundles
of 100 rupee notes.
We'll spend like crazy
and have butter chicken every day!
Good night.
Hunny, can you come up on the bed?
I don't like it all alone.
I just can't fall asleep.
Idiot, do you want to suck
on my thumb now??
Go to sleep!
You are excited, aren't you?
I'll play a nice tune,
it'll help you relax.
That sounds good.
Hunny, meanwhile, why don't you
give me a nice head massage.
It feels really good
and will help me fall asleep.
My legs are aching after standing
at Bholi's place for hours.
No Lali, you don't have to...
but okay... if you insist.
Feels so good...
Can you turn off the lights?
Turn off the lights,
I just can't find sleep.
You won't find sleep
even if you turn off the lights
When will I find a beauty
to turn off the lights for me?
Go off to sleep Choocha,
or else Bholi will wake up.
I won't spare you.
Get away.
Here... wham... bam!
Choocha...
Hey!
Choocha...
Wake up.
What happened?
Come on, out with the golden egg.
Why are you all staring?
Hurry up or I'll punch you.
Dude, you know
I don't remember it easily.
Give me a minute.
Choocha, come on.
Yes, now I remember...
I saw that...
you...
I?
I saw that you were...
dead.
Listen to me...
I saw that you were dead
and the four legs of your bed...
were slowly turning into the
four ends of your coffin.
Then Lali, Zafar and Panditji and l..
Carry your coffin
to the crematorium.
As I am about to light the pyre...
your butt catches fire,
you wake up with a jolt and...
start running towards the jungle.
And you run into...
none other than Bholi Punjaban!
Who transforms into a lion
and swallows you.
As soon as I reach there...
I shove my hand in Bholi's mouth,
who is now a lion...
and pull you out.
Your butt's still ablaze.
Anyway, I get furious,
I walk up to Bholi...
look her straight in the eye and
tear her face in two.
One part I throw east, the other west.
Knockout!
Four legs of a bed, four ends of a coffin,
four shoulders...
the number is definitely four!
A burning pyre?
Pyre...
pyre comes from fire...
So it's the Goddess of fire, Ma Jwala.
And?
Dude, the...
Lion!
Lion is what the Goddess Vaishno rides on.
So, we're sure about the Goddess.
Goddess Vaishno is
also known as...
Durga.
So it's number four on Jai Durga.
Come, it's time to party with Bholi.
What about your burning butt though?
Listen, you minister's pet.
Get this once and for all!
First you make the payment,
then you get the delivery.
Got it?
If you haven't...
come here and I'll make sure
you get it.
Bye!
I didn't think you'd turn up.
Well, here we are...
loaded with ammunition.
Just say fire.
You have a way with words, I must say.
Out with the name and number.
Sure, but I have something
else to tell you.
You see, the jackpot amount is not nearly
enough now that the partners have increased.
I was wondering if you would
invest 440,000 instead of 220,000.
The profit doubles
and everyone is happy.
What do you say?
Unbelievable!
Trying to sell me another deal!
Fine.
I'm ready to play any amount
you want me to!
But hear me out once again...
if my money goes down the drain...
I'll shove my hand up your behind
and grab twice as much.
Still want me to raise the investment?
No...
Bholiji, 440,000 is good.
In fact, let's just stay at 220,000.
Sorry madam,
let's keep that deal open for the future.
Right now, let's just play 440,000
on Jai Durga number four.
Listen Damroo, bet 440,000
on Jai Durga number four, for me.
Yeah, today's draw.
Call me as soon as the number is out.
Tell me, Damroo!
Okay.
Yes?
Who wants to go first?
Madam, trust me,
I've never gone wrong with my formula.
Perhaps he said four
and you misheard it.
Why don't you check again?
Why don't I shove the phone
down your throat, you smartass?
That way you can keep dialling.
Get it?
Bholiji, what about my shop deeds?
Shut up!
Coach, you better control your team!
Yes?
How do I get back my money?
Don't whisper in his ear.
Speak up, loud and clear.
Madamji, I told...
Shh!
Madamji, I told him that we
should work out installments.
We'll pay back a little every month.
Why not?
I'll come up with an EMl scheme,
just for you.
On this note slap yourself real hard.
Why?
Slap yourself or he will do it.
I'll do it, don't bother him.
Harder.
Hey...
Is that good?
Happy?
And you, Billa's little puppy,
should I call him?
No, please don't call dad.
Well then,
tell me how you intend to pay me back.
We don't have the money.
If we had,
we wouldn't have come to you.
We needed the money to get into college
But here you need the money to get out.
In that case, why don't you tell us
what to do?
As he said, we don't have the money.
I just have one way out for you.
There's a rave party tonight
at the Faridabad-Gurgaon border.
And this is what you'll have to do.
I'll give you some pills that
you have to sell there.
Each pill is for 3,000 rupees.
And you'll have 500 such pills.
You think it'll sell at that price?
Like hot cakes!
It will be teeming with
the rich and wealthy.
So?
Alright madam, we will do it.
Do you know what those pills are?
Whatever they are,
we have to sell them.
I don't think Bholi is ready
to negotiate.
It's an order, not a request.
How will you sell the pills?
Just like you sell samosas at your shop.
Hunny, tell him to shut up.
Relax! Even I am afraid.
But shedding tears or raising your Voice
won't get you anywhere with Bholi.
Let me know if you have another option.
Dude, which of these is the door?
Move out!
500 pills and no
hanky-panky with the money, okay?
Chooch!
You're staying with me.
I knew it!
Looking at the love for me in your eyes,
I didn't want to leave.
Let them go.
In fact,
even the Chicago Bulls should go.
My stories will make you fall
head over heels in love with me.
Go on, I'll be fine.
In my 30 years on earth
and 16 year career...
no one has ever
yapped such bullshit around me.
I really don't get you.
Who do you think you are?
Talking rubbish all the time!
You can leave, he remains here.
Another thing...
if you get into any trouble...
I don't know you and you don't know me.
All I care about is my money.
Otherwise you'll be joining
my handicapped army.
Get it?
Now leave!
Lali...
why don't you give me your phone,
that way I can stay in touch.
I mean, you shouldn't think I'm ignoring
you guys just because I'm with a girl.
Priya...
Yeah?
What do you want?
Can't I call you?
Hurry up, I need to study
for the exams.
Here.
What's this?
The latest chartbusters.
Why are you giving this to me?
It's a gift, just take it.
But why?
Listen, there's a fabulous
party happening in Gurgaon later.
And you're coming with me.
have you lost your mind?
There are still three days
to go for the exams.
And anyway, I'll give you the
question paper the day before.
You can easily learn the answers.
I don't want your CD,
I don't want the papers...
and I don't want to
go to the party either!
Why don't you take your
girlfriend with you?
Well...
we broke up today.
What do you mean, broke up?
What's it to you?
Are you thinking of me as
your boyfriend?
What nonsense!
It's not like you've
said 'l love you' to me.
If I do, will you reconsider?
Go away.
Not fair.
I thought I'd take you along
and we'd have a great time.
I had such a tough time
convincing my friends about you.
And now you're playing hard to get.
We're gentlemen,
I'll bring you back home safe?
Don't complain later that
you couldn't attend the party.
What excuse do I give at home?
Make up anything.
Say you are staying over
at your friend's place to study.
Fine, I'll come along.
Pick me up from outside the Jain temple.
Great, I'll pick you up at 9pm.
And no salwar-kameez, okay?
You should look hot.
Priya!
I love you.
What's the big deal about this pill
that it costs 3,000 rupees?
For that amount,
I could get a month's groceries...
or pay ten years of school fees...
or buy ten pairs ofjeans...
And this one pill is worth so much?
There's definitely a big deal,
got to figure this thing out.
Hunny, stop talking nonsense!
Each pill is accounted for.
Don't create another mess.
As it is, you've brought a girl along.
Will you stop with the sermon!
have you ever been to a party?
Stags like us are not allowed in.
But a girl helps open doors.
Look...
here comes our passport.
I must say...
there's something amusing about you.
What's with your dreams?
There's a very long story to it.
I'd like to hear it.
If you say so.
Madam, it begins more than 20 million
years ago, when I was a little boy...
Hold on!
How many years ago?
Were your ancestors even born back then?
This isn't right.
Just because I love you
doesn't mean you can interrupt me.
This is how I narrate my story
and it begins 20 million years ago.
You either hear the story
or pass me that plate.
I'm sorry.
Narrate it the way you want, alright?
Shoot!
It begins 20 billion years ago...
It's all good now?
I'm here, and so is my friend
It's all good now?
I'm here, and so is my friend
And an evening of great fun
The chance is good, have fun
Make the most of this
The chance is good, have fun
Make the most of this
And that's when Chacha
Nehru called me from the moon...
and I said, ""Yes, Choocha speaking.""
So Chacha Nehru said...
Who knew the world could be spirited
With dance and music,
with rhythm and clapping
That I would get both love and money
I was ruined till now,
now I'll have everyjoy.
With a click
With a click I could get
all my heart desires
Now we can have chicken
for two meals everyday.
It's all good now?
I'm here, and so is my friend
It's all good now?
I'm here, and so is my friend
And an evening of great fun
The chance is good, have fun
Make the most of this
The chance is good, have fun
Make the most of this
lgnore the words of the sane
Darling, why not speak the words of love?
If you ever want to go shopping,
come here
I've set up a shop of dreams in my eyes
I am putting my heart up for sale
I am putting my heart up
for sale at half the rate
I've split my head banging
it on your door
It's all good now?
I'm here, and so is my friend
It's all good now?
I'm here, and so is my friend
And an evening of great fun
The chance is good, have fun
Make the most of this
The chance is good, have fun
Make the most of this
Catch him.
Leave him, Go after that guy!
Quickly.
Catch him.
Priya...
are you my girlfriend?
Answer me...
I even said 'l love you'.
Priya?
Talk to me.
Remember what you said on the roof?
Sir, there's no one else around here.
Let's go.
Priya?
Priya...
What do you think of yourself?
What's wrong?
What did I do?
What did you do?
You lied and brought me to
a party of drug addicts.
Right now you tried to
take advantage of me.
Yet you're asking what you did!
I was stupid, I got carried away...
I thought you really liked me.
I always believed there was
some innocence behind your pranks.
I considered you a good person,
but your intentions are pure evil.
That's not true, Priya...
I really like you.
Don't you touch me!
You are a no-good scoundrel.
A pest!
Never show your face again.
Sir, he seems to be a pro at racing.
But his motorcycle is his downfall.
It's thumping roar will give it away.
Do you know Neetu?
Tell me, how do you know her?
Don't answer my question
with a question.
How do you know Neetu?
Who is it?
- Zafar.
- Lali.
What's the meaning of this?
And at this late hour?
Ma'am, I'll explain everything,
but first please hide this somewhere.
What's in it?
Ma'am, it has...
Neetu, it's drugs.
The cops are after us,
please hide this somewhere.
Yes, ma'am, please.
Ma'am, please...
Where's the packet?
Sir... what packet?
I don't understand...
Now do you?
Where did you hide the packet?
Sir, sorry, I was afraid and
that's why I lied.
Tell me, where is the packet?
Sir, it fell somewhere in the commotion.
I swear.
Check the place.
Sir, why are you asking
about the packet?
You don't know why I'm asking?
Smartass...
Sir... you...
Hold that thought,
I'll be right with you.
Answer me.
Sir, the packet you're talking about probably
contains take away menu's of his restaurant.
Which he is saying he dropped somewhere.
Yes, sir.
Are you his counsel?
Then you must be knowing
the colour of his underwear too.
Isn't it?
So, tell me, what was on
the menu besides marijuana?
Sir, I don't even drink dark chocolate,
let alone do drugs.
You can test if you want.
Sir, I have a catering business, thought
I'd fetch some orders for future parties.
And right now there aren't too
many weddings taking place.
If you were innocent,
why did you run?
Sir, as soon as I got there,
it was chaos.
People were screaming, 'run,
the cops are here!'
And so I ran.
My dad always says, 'stay away
from cops and thugs'.
'They're two sides of the same coin.'
I don't know about thugs, but you
should definitely stay away from cops.
Come on.
Narrate the rest of your story
at the police station.
And call your old wise man too.
Sir... no, sir.
Did you find it?
Excuse me, who are you?
How did you just barge in to my house?
He will tell you, who I am.
Just showed him my lD.
He made us run after him like dogs
for 45 minutes.
There's nothing here, sir.
What's the meaning of this?
How can you search
without a warrant?
How do you know them?
I am Neetu, and this is Lali, my student.
He takes tuitions from me.
And this is my fiance, Zafar.
You give tuitions at this hour?
Listen, I too have graduated.
I've been a student and a teacher.
And I've been engaged quite a few times.
You're fortunate that
we didn't get the packet.
But don't think you are free.
Come and see me
at the police station tomorrow.
Get it?
Let's go.
What is it that you're studying, anyway?
Sir...
Debit what comes in...
credit what goes out.
I can't believe you could
stoop so low.
Ma'am, how do you know Zafar?
I'll deal with you later.
Sit over there.
And you, cat got your tongue?
Speak up.
No matter what I say,
you won't believe it.
How nice, Zafar!
Why did you ever walk into my life?
You've messed up
my peaceful existence.
You're neither with me
nor have you let me go.
And your ego!
You could have told me,
at least said a word.
You can apologise a million times...
but couldn't share your
problem with me?
Excuse me, ma'am!
Ma'am, please tell me
where you hid the packet.
have you completely lost it, Lali?
You still want the packet?
I flushed it down the toilet.
What?
You flushed it?
have you lost your mind?
Do you know what you've done?
Lali, behave yourself!
Behave myself?
You flushed 1.5 million rupees!
And with it my shop's deed.
Did you give it any thought?
You already seem to have a thing for Zafar.
Why didn't you tell me you
are his girlfriend?
You betrayed me!
What rubbish, Lali?
How did I betray you?
When a crumb was stuck
in my moustache, didn't you brush it off?
Didn't you rest your hand on my shoulder,
while riding with me on the bike?
Didn't you want Shalu and me to break up,
so something could start between us?
Why did you do those things
if you didn't like me?
Oh God!
I didn't know you were such a fool!
I didn't betray you.
Idiot!
Can I use your phone?
Please?
Yes, Choocha speaking.
Choocha, we're in a terrible mess.
What did you say?
Choocha?
Give me the phone.
Who is this?
Listen Choocha or whoever you are...
don't you drag them into any mess,
get it?
Hello, madam...
how dare you call me Choocha,
do you even know me?
Listen, it's me, Lali.
Lali or lollypop,
don't you call me Choocha!
And why are you talking in
a girl's Voice?
That's not me,
that was Neetu madam.
Oh I see,
it's a cross connection.
Hang up and call me again.
Hello?
Yes, Choocha speaking.
Listen, it's all over.
We have no idea where
Hunny and Priya are.
And we've also lost the pills.
All I can say is
we were saved by a whisker!
I suggest you escape too.
And I mean it.
Do you hear me?
Hello?
Yes Khanna, did you raid the party?
Yes, but the narcotics
squad was also there.
Whom did you send
this time with the pills?
He escaped with it.
Escaped?
Bloody government mongrel!
You aren't there
to sniff out useless things.
At least once be on time.
You ruined the entire plan, you idiot.
What if he comes back with the packet now?
Nothing I could do to him.
It's a loss... hang up now.
Madam, Choocha run...
Then you also run, son of a gun!
Run!
Yes, madam.
Hello?
Dude, what have you gotten me into?
Where's Hunny?
I don't know.
The cops raided the place
and everyone escaped.
And you conveniently got to a girl's place.
Fantastic!
You got me screwed.
I'll come and get you.
Where are you?
I'm near Yamuna market.
Hurry up!
Don't forget to get me a cola.
Cola?
Madam Bholi...
man on ground,
holding Bobby's balls.
What to do?
Break his hand and bring him fast.
Okay, madam.
Yes, where are you going?
Where are you going?
Stop.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Cola?
She's not called Bholi Punjaban
for nothing.
Don't even think about running away.
Anyway, you losers won't have passports
to get out of the country...
and if you hide anywhere here,
she will hunt you down.
Panditji, we're not here to be insulted.
Tell us if you've got a solution to this.
You can do away with the attitude.
I suggest, you go to Bholi
and let her do what she wants to.
In that case,
should we stand straight or bend over?
Pandit is right.
Are you serious, Zafar?
Of course, I am...
or else let me know if
you have another option.
I knew you were a hustler
when you told me about the dream and...
gave me your fraud mom's fake necklace!
That's when I knew that
you are a pain in the butt!
I feel like letting my men loose on you and throw
you into the Yamuna river, tied to a big rock.
But if you drown,
I won't get my money back.
Now, listen to me carefully...
last chance...
You have 24 hours...
to get me back my money, 2.5 million.
2.5 million?
Yes...
two-point-five million.
880,000 for the lotteries
and 1.5 for the pills.
Bholiji, that adds up to 2.38 million.
What's the extra for?
Bloody Einstein!
The extra is for pardoning you.
To be honest you guys are actually
worthless but I am quite generous.
2.5 million or else Billa's restaurant
will be my new address.
Are you sure?
You don't want me to come with you?
No, let it be, I'll manage.
The world can read the wisdom
of the texts
and yet it won't find contentment.
Two and a half letters ofjugaad
if read, you will be set
There is fighting everywhere,
there is sorrow
Become alert
Don't go around in circles,
O innocent one
Now, focus on your goal
Focus on the goal,
on the innocent goal, focus.
The deadline
ls killing everyone
Even in their sleep,
Everyone's running a race
if you want to save yourself
if you want a future
From here and there, from anywhere
Grab what you can
Find a fix, find a quick fix
Make a quick guess or hit bulls eye
Find a fix, find a quick fix
if you want to save yourself
if you want a future
From here and there, from anywhere
Grab what you can
Find a fix, find a quick fix
I don't know how we will get the money.
We're getting deeper into this mess.
I don't understand why you
didn't tell the cops everything.
Are you kidding?
The cops won't believe our story.
They suspect us
I was the one being chased.
The cops could lock us up for life!
And...
if my dad hears about it,
I'm dead for sure.
There has to be a solution.
Dude...
I wanted to tell you that...
I had a dream last night.
Are you crazy?
Thanks to your dream we
are in this mess today.
Despite how my dad is,
he loves the restaurant...
and won't survive if he hears that
he has lost the restaurant to Bholi.
Took us for a ride... both of them.
Who asked you to follow
us to Bholi's place?
You came on your own
blowing your own trumpet...
and handed over the deed to Bholi.
On top of that you're arguing,
after losing the pills.
Why shouldn't I?
That's my shop at stake.
'We win the lottery every time.'
What happened this time?
I'll break your face.
Shut up Choocha!
Dude... it was my mistake.
We are in this mess thanks to me.
That night,
I couldn't sleep thinking about the riches.
All of you fell asleep and
I was awake all night like an owl.
I pretended to be asleep
next morning fearing Hunny...
cooked up a dream
and that's why the number didn't click.
Why didn't you open your mouth then?
We would've requested
Bholi for more time.
Sorry, I was afraid.
I goofed up.
But this dream is real...
and Hunny's formula is rock solid too.
It's no use accepting your goof up now.
It's useless even if it's real.
It's not useless.
Hunny and I have a record.
If it's a record,
you can play it all you want.
Who will give the money?
Your pop?
Lali!
How much do you want?
Neetu!
Neetu ma'am.
have you lost your mind?
Yesterday you were angry
at me and now you're getting into this.
Do you have any other option, Zafar?
If they are telling the truth,
perhaps it's possible that...
if and perhaps in
the same sentence, Neetu.
Do I need to say anything more?
Hunny, I've heard enough of your crap.
No more arguments, please.
Right, until yesterday all of this sounded
like music to your ears, now it's crap!
Yes, we all had our needs...
got carried away, especially me.
We got greedy, took a shortcut
and got involved with a hustler.
Well, you suggested the hustler's name.
Perhaps you are hand in glove with her.
That's enough!
Zafar... Lali... Neetu madam...
for once please believe
what I'm saying.
I swear on my mother.
We are failures when it comes to studies,
but never with the lottery.
So, what was your dream?
Say it.
Lali, what are you doing?
Fine, you can do as you wish!
Count me out, thank you.
Zafar...
Never mind him...
you carry on.
Don't get angry on hearing it.
Come on already!
Okay.
I saw that, while chasing a falling kite,
a mad dog bites you.
Then you start barking like that mad dog...
and go around in circles
chasing your own tail.
Somehow I get there and
as the mad dog jumps at you...
I send it flying with a kick.
Then I lift the other mad dog,
that is you, up in my arms...
and in slow motion I take you
to the veterinarian.
You take a liking to me and...
keep licking my face all
along the way.
The veterinarian pierces
you with big injections...
transforming you into
my friend Hunny again.
Choocha,
you actually dream these things?
Or always cook them up?
I mean, I'm the one who's
getting screwed every time.
Except for the last one,
all dreams are real.
I swear.
Of course.
It's better to be hounded
by Bholi than to have a friend like you.
Don't say that.
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
Don't I always save you in the dreams?
Dude, if you're through with the reunion,
can we decode the number?
Number!
Dog...
A dog bit...
with his teeth.
And a dog has 32 teeth.
3 plus 2 makes 5.
When a dog bites...
you get 14 injections.
1 plus 4 is also 5.
The number is five.
What colour was the dog?
You or the mad dog that bit you?
Black.
Black dog...
Black dog is...
Bhairo Baba's pet.
And Bhairo Baba's temple
is behind the old fort.
The old fort is in Delhi and...
Delhi's old name is...
lndraprastha.
Indraprastha lottery number five!
We got the number,
what about the money?
I can help you with some.
My savings and other investments
add up to about 300,000.
125,000 is for Zafar's dad's treatment...
You can use the rest, if it helps.
What about Zafar?
Zafar is not ready to listen.
Well, we need more money...
I can manage some
but we'll still fall short.
I will get the rest.
No, Lali, your restaurant is already...
Precisely why I have to see this through.
And what plans do we have?
Hello?
Who is it?
My mother!
Hail thee!
The Mother Goddess has called on me
from the temple
Hey... you better stop laughing, okay?
We're artists renowned for our art.
Our art is priceless.
Sure, if you say so!
Both of you do look cute.
I'm going in now...
don't want to miss your entry.
Dude, what's down there?
Where?
Dude!
Hail the Goddess of the lions
Long live your reign
Always be praised
if I was the lion of your temple
That's our cue.
All the best, dude!
I would take you on my back
and through the jungle
I would be blessed by you every day
if I was the lion of your temple
if I was the peacock in your garden
The peacock in your garden,
if I was the peacock in your garden.
If I was the peacock in your garden
Where the hell is Choocha?
If I was the peacock in your garden
The entire amount for what?
Last time he didn't perform.
Today you ruined the costume.
Won't I take it out of your money?
What about the trouble I went through?
By God, Pradhan, I've seen enough swindlers
but you beat them all.
You're taking advantage of our innocence,
aren't you?
Innocence, my foot!
Hello... Lali...
We didn't get as much as we expected...
I'll try and figure some other way,
but I suggest you push a little harder too.
Dear God, I don't know what's going
to happen today...
or how it will finally unfold...
I leave it all up to you.
Please, get us through.
You know what's best for us.
Just get us out of this mess, please!
Brother, the dopehead ran away
with the petrol tank.
Thank you sir, which way did he go?
No man, I don't eat non-veg food.
Where is he?
Bloody dopehead,
I won't spare you today!
Why are you after my motorcycle?
Whoa, take it easy.
What have I done?
This fuel tank is from
your aircraft, is it?
What have I done?
If it's not mine, is it yours?
On your feet, you jerk!
Time to take you to the cops.
Then we will know whose tank it is!
Fine, let's go.
You think I'm afraid?
I'm not a loser.
I can buy the cops at
the snap of my fingers.
My pockets are overflowing with money.
Look at this take a good look...
What?!
Never seen so much money
in one go, have you?
Dumbstruck, aren't you?
How come you have all this money?
Remember I had told you...
my money is gathering dust.
I have 12 shops in Gandhinagar...
all leased out.
I even file my income tax returns.
All my wealth is white...
only my deeds are black.
What will you do with this money?
I'll make paper boats and
leave them in the sewer...
you've got a problem?
What if I double your money
in a few hours?
What do you say?
Sardarji...
are you high on something too?
Shut up!
Or I'll slap you hard!
I'm not taking your money for nothing...
you can have my motorcycle as collateral.
Alright, you can have it.
Keep your motorcycle too.
Meet me at the
temple near the river after 4 pm.
To hell with double.
Bring back what you take.
Not like I can take all
this with me when I die.
Here you go.
And don't forget the petrol tank.
Guess what, I found some more...
keep this as well.

Hello Zafar we won the jackpot!
Impressive.
You all are bunch of scoundrels,
including your coach.
Managed 2.5 million in one day!
You sure you haven't printed
these notes yourself?
Madam, you can take your own time
and check each one!
Smartass!
One sniff and I'll know
which ones are fake.
Get it?
I had some other plans for you.
I thought I'd give you a hard time.
Qet you to do some more work...
Nevermind.
Dismissed!
Yes, what's the matter?
Why are you still here?
Waiting for my wedding?
Madam, go ahead, give us a hard time,
get more work done...
It's not like we are waiting
to click pictures with you.
This covers the payment for the job done.
What say we do this again?
What?
Here's 700,000 advance...
got any more pills?
Once a scoundrel,
always a scoundrel!
What do you say, coach?
I say, go for it.
Really?
Where will you sell them?
Just give us the stuff.
We'll figure how and where to set up shop.
Brilliant!
I'll make sure I'm there
for your opening night.
I'll give pills for a million.
Make the most of it.
Let's go.
Loafers, O Loafers,
your luck is so messed up
Even your shoes are in tatters
Your luck is so messed up.

Hello Zafar we won the jackpot!
Neetu, bring everyone over
to the police station.
What?
What happened that day, sardarji?
Sir, we were afraid you wouldn't
believe us.
We only wanted to return
the money and leave.
What if I still don't believe you?
Sir...
Zafar is as innocent as a cow...
an artist.
Lali here... is a saint.
Every bad deed possible
we've had our hand in it.
Sir, we tried selling those pills
because we needed money.
Never realised that we were selling poison.
It was fortunate that
you raided the party...
and those pills went down the gutter
instead of somebody's blood-stream.
Sir...
please think about Zafar's plan.
You'll get what you want and
we'll be even with Bholi.
If you...
still feel...
Okay.
She won't refuse your offer.
She's always looking
for scapegoats like you.
To sell her stuff.
It's great if her stuff sells...
and if it's confiscated...
she has her moles in the
police department...
who give her stuff back to her.
But it's guys like you
who get mired in her plans.
Make sure, she doesn't suspect you.
Thank you, sir.
We won't give up the money...
moreover, we deserve a reward...
and to be part of the Republic day parade.
Hello... May day... May day... Ready!
Sir, what if you get delayed?
What if your binoculars are hazy
or car tyre is punctured...
or your mother calls you back home.
Or what if a traffic cop stops you...
Let there be a country of loafers
and make me the President.
Sing with me now, brothers and sisters.

A journalist reports on the life of Mahi Arora, a renowned film actress, describing her as unstable and problematic, but damaged and lonely due to childhood trauma, and bipolar disorder. Through a flashback, we are shown Mahi's relationship with leading film actor, Aryan Khanna. Aryan is going through a divorce whilst dating Mahi. The couple make a sex tape of themselves. When Mahi learns of an intimate scene Aryan is shooting for a film, she causes a scene on the set, which upsets Aryan. The couple reconciles but Mahi is repeatedly insulted by Aryan's wife. While driving back from a party with Aryan, she raises the topic of his wife, which results in her being thrown out of the car.

Realising her place in Aryan's life, Mahi goes into depression, putting her career in decline. A friend convinces Mahi to leave the past behind her and re-enter the industry so Mahi decides to rejuvenate her career. She employs a public relations manager, Pallavi, who uses sensationalist tactics to reinvent Mahi's image. Mahi starts a relationship with the Vice Captain of the India national cricket team, Angad Paul. Soon, her personal and professional life are stable once again. On the advice of Pallavi, she uses Angad's connections to get a role in a big budget film. The lead actor of the film, Abbas Khan, a married playboy, attempts to initiate an affair with her. She rejects him, which causes him to seek revenge. He demands that the director re-edit the movie so that the story becomes about him and an item girl. Mahi is dissatisfied despite the film being a success, and in a desperate attempt to prove her acting skills, works in a low-budget art film for months. Angad proposes to her but she feels that they should concentrate on their careers. This causes their relationship to end. The art film never completes, and Mahi goes into depression again. She is also denied the opportunity to adopt a child, due to her history of alcoholism and psychiatric problems. Since she cannot get a role in big budget productions, she decides to work on a low-budget film with newcomers.

Mahi meets Aryan at a wedding, and he apologises. The two rekindle their relationship. Aryan says that he wants her to do a big budget film with him but the director is reluctant to cast her as she has lost her appeal. Mahi becomes obsessed with the thought of losing the role to another heroine. At a poorly-attended press conference for an upcoming film, Mahi is mocked by journalists who inform her that the director has cast another actress opposite Aryan. Distraught, Mahi and Pallavi decide to create controversy by leaking the sex tape of her and Aryan. The video becomes a viral sensation and as a result, the low-budget film becomes an instant hit.

Mahi's success is short-lived. She starts questioning her career and life choices. She finally decides to leave the industry after her agent Rashid Bhai, a father figure to her, quits, and Shagufta Rizvi, a veteran actress she respected and admired, dies. At the end, Mahi is shown walking alone in a foreign country, and on being asked if she is Mahi Arora, she replies she is not.",3135,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt1949548.srt","<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>

lf you don't talk to me,
l am helpless.
Your phone is ringing.
At least answer your phone.
lf you don't talk,
how will we know what's wrong.
Please say something.
What's the problem?
Mahi... let's go.
- Come on, let's go!
- She wants to lodge a complaint.
Sorry, sir. There's no complaint.
Who are you?
l am her secretary.
Let's go.
Get up!
Mahi, get up.
Let's go.
Come on.
This way... good.
You shouldn't have
come to the police station.
Mahi, against whom do you
want to lodge a complaint?
Move away!
Allow us to go!
Mahi... Are you getting married
to Aryan Khanna?
What is your relationship
with Aryan Khanna?
Mahi, did you know that
lsha was attending the same party?
Mahi...
Out.
- l am ready.
- Action.
Mahi Arora.
What can l say about her...
Unpredictable.
But journalists like me have to use
adjectives for them.
So there were a few...
lmpulsive, vulnerable, drama queen.
Mahi Arora was a star...
but she was different
from the other actresses.
She was fabulous at interviews.
Her words,
they always struck a chord somewhere.
She was bit of a rebel.
And why not?
A broken family,
parents fighting everyday...
disturbed childhood...
And then?
Mahi got a reason to be wild.
And she fled her home to Mumbai.
lt's a well known fact
that the film industry...
adores complicated stories.
Thus, Mahi Arora became...
The star!
Good morning, Rashid bhai.
- Hi!
- Hi!
Happy?
- You are looking lovely.
- Yes!
- So, how's it going?
- All well.
Rashid bhai...
cancel all appointments for today.
But why, Mahi?
Well, l want to rest all day.
So l look fabulous
at the success party.
Alright.
- What do you think guys?
- Superb!
Like you always do.
By the way guys...
did you see Gayatri Reddy
at the premiere party?
My God!
She was bitching about you
to Rhea Mehra.
Really?
Can't these actresses
ever be happy for their peers?
Mahi, you must watch out, okay?
Please, Andy!
When have l ever
competed with them?
l just want to have fun.
Also, the film is a hit.
And, l've got some
good titles ahead.
So, who cares about
what they say?
l completely agree.
Gracy...
my cigarettes.
Anyway...
l've brought
some outfits along.
Please try them on, babes.
Let's decide what you will wear
to the party tonight.
No, l don't want to.
Choose any you like.
l will just wear that.
Okay then.
Red?
Red.
By the way,
Aryan is also attending the party.
Oh come on!
Has he ever attended
any of you functions?
He won't attend
like always.
Rats, come on, be positive.
lt's possible that
tonight he might attend.
God knows!
Sameer!
Sameer, l love you.
l love you Rhea!
Love you Danish!
Abbas Khan!
Hey Gayatri!
l love you Gayatri!
Angad, its said that,
soon you'll be promoted...
from Vice-captain to Captain
of the lndian Cricket team.
Well, this is a film party and...
l'd appreciate if you would not
talk about cricket now.
Gayatri, everyone's talking about
the rivalry between Mahi and you.
Would you like to
comment on that?
Mahi and l are just acquaintances,
there's no rivalry.
And l'm really happy that
Sameer and Mahi's film is a hit.
That is why l'm here.
Well, Abbas you...
you've been such a rare sight.
l am really surprised
to see you here.
l'm here to give my
best wishes to Sameer.
l heard you are
writing your biography.
Vibha!
Why do l have to write
my own biography?
There are plenty of ex-editors
from various publications.
Someone will do the honors.
That's so typical
Abbas Khan, you know!
- Hey Rhea!
- Congratulations.
You deserved it completely.
Yeah!
l told you that the
film will be a super hit.
Thank you.
- Your new film, Custody, is out, isn't it?
- Yes.
Everyone's been talking about
your performance.
But, you know, l've been so busy,
haven't had the time to watch it.
Oh! l'll have
a screening for you.
They're bonding
as if they were sisters.
Such hypocrites.
Meet Kalpana,
SM Channel head.
Hello.
This is Mukesh Tyagi.
He is a big project designer.
Meet Shaheen Khan,
she's an upcoming actress.
Her debut film 'Mumbai Love'
was out recently.
Wow! That's great.
She's also doing
two regional films.
He didn't make it.
l told you, right?
Get me a drink.
Mahi...
- Get me a drink, now!
- Okay.
Action!
Cut!
Number taken
clap out.
And 5... 6...
7... 8.
Cut... cut it.
Cut it.
Mahi, it's simply not happening.
We'll shoot after the break.
Break for lunch.
Mahi, you need to focus.
lf you need more reharsals,
then just do it.
Fine!
Please give her
some easy steps...
So many retakes...
Tablet.
l'm sorry, babes.
That jerk off, Sameer Khan.
l don't watch his films,
so how could l come for his party?
Well, the party was
for my success too.
And you told me
you would attend.
l couldn't say no
when you asked me.
l didn't want to hurt you.
You did the same by
not attending.
Rats told me that
you wouldn't come.
Come on, Mahi.
That psycho b****!
Why are you taking her seriously?
Because you
don't take me seriously!
That's nonsense, Mahi!
lt's true.
lf you took me seriously,
l'd know.
Babes! l am sorry, okay?
l f***** up! l am sorry.
Please babes, come on...
You know what...
l'm coming to your place,
after the pack-up.
l will make up for everything.
Aryan...
l've sent my passport
to your office.
The visa for the Bahamas
takes about 15 days.
For God sake, Mahi!
The Bahamas trip is three months away!
So what?
l am so excited.
This holiday is very
important for me.
We've never been on
a holiday together.
ls that my phone?
Where is it?
Perfect timing!
Yeah!
Really?
l'll be there in 20 minutes.
Yeah.
Damn!
Akshat isn't feeling well.
l've got to go home.
l am sorry babes.
Hey.
What's wrong with my Spiderman?
How're you feeling?
Since when does he
have a fever?
As soon as he got back from school.
He was feeling weak,
so l called the doctor.
Go to sleep.
You will be okay.
l love you.
Sorry, Aryan.
Akshat insisted to see you...
that's why l asked you to come over.
Were you at your place or at Mahi's?
How does it matter?
l see...
By the way, the lawyer called.
He said the divorce documents are ready and
l should sign them.
- So do it!
- l will.
But, l want to ask you something.
What have you thought about the
Bandstand apartment?
What's there to think?
l've told you before that
l am keeping it.
l've given you this apartment
as well as two more in Goa.
But l don't want it for me.
l want it for your son.
His school is nearby the place.
lsha...
you know l bought that apartment
for my parents.
You can move them
to your place in Malad.
This is unbelievable!
You know, l just can't believe this!
Three properties... 100 million settlement...
and you still want more!
l didn't expect this from you...
l too had a lot of expectations...
let's not go there.
lt's better you take a decision
about the apartment...
so l can sign the documents,
okay?
You are too much, lsha!
Thanks so much, Rhea,
for this exclusive interview. Really!
Anything for you, Tamanna!
You're coming with me
to Spain, okay?
l would love to. Thanks again.
Okay, bye baby, see you.
Yeah, Nisha?
What?
Really?
Shit!
l was certain it would happen.
No chance at all?
Sure?
Okay, l'll call you later.
Hey babes!
- Babes...
- Hi!
Babes, what happened?
You seem tense, what's wrong?
Do you know the owner
of Panache Diamonds?
- Yes, that dude, Jay Sanghvi, right?
- Yes.
What about Panache?
Their endorsement deal was
up for renewal.
- My team has been trying for the past two years.
- Okay...
But even this year,
they are continuing with Mahi.
lt's fine.
lt's not fine!
lf l get this deal...
it will be a clincher.
What now?.
You know...
Jay Sanghvi... he is bisexual.
And, he has the hots for you.
Listen...
l really need this.
Dude, not a word outside.
Bro... l know.
ln this industry,
both zippers and lips should be opened carefully.
Say hi to Rhea.
Okay, bro.
Mahi...
Rhea has won
the Panache Diamond endorsement deal.
lt's okay.
l can't endorse everything, can l?
You take everything very lightly.
Yes, mom.
l will see you soon.
- Are you going to Noida?
- Yes.
- Are you going for the dinner?
- Yes.
Hi mom.
Hi Mahi.
Hello Mahi, congrats.
l heard your film is a hit.
Yes!
When is the next release?
l don't know.
You can read about it in the papers.
Oh yes!
l've recommended you for the
Padamshree award.
Really?
Thanks.
Come...
You came to Delhi three times
last month.
Yet you didn't come here.
Well, if l had,
l would've had to meet your 'special' cabinet minister.
And, you know l don't like him.
What about your 'special' co-star?
The last time you were here...
you had said his divorce would
be finalized in six months.
lt's been eight months since then.
Did you talk to him?
Did he say anything?
- ls he marrying you or not?
- Mom, stop it!
All those questions!
Have l ever asked you
about your relationships?
Because you aren't my mother!
Look Mahi...
l know you are quite insecure
about this relationship.
And, one day this insecurity
will develop into an obsession.
lt could backfire and...
you'll be left with
neither relationship nor career.
l think you are confused, mom.
You are talking about yourself,
not about me.
l am very different from you.
My life is fully under control.
l am sure it is.
But do you know...
you had said the same about
your previous relationships?
Do you remember?
We'll complete the dubbing in the evening.
Next week you have two events.
A spa opening in Hyderabad and...
ajewelry exhibition in Jaipur.
Take care, Mahesh!
- Hi Tamanna.
- Hi Mahi.
You were here to interview my director?
Yes.
Ever since you joined Mumbai Daily,
you haven't called me.
Come on, Mahi.
lt's not that.
l was busy, that's all.
Busy?
With Rhea Mehra, right?
You've put her on the cover page
twice in one week!
ln fact, she does a lot for you.
Free vacations for your family...
new laptop for you... shopping in Dubai...
She is such a nice person!
That's absolute nonsense, Mahi.
Rhea is a close friend.
ln fact, l've known her even
before she became a star.
How sweet!
That's why you publish
all the negative things...
she has to say about me.
Mahi!
Wake up, Tamanna.
You are the associate editor
of Mumbai Daily.
Film stars aren't your friends.
They are friends with your position.
By the way...
speaking of positions...
l'm having dinner with
your group editor tonight.
l'm sure we'll talk about you.
B****!
Rats, where are you
Weren't you coming here?
What?
Are you serious?
Rashid bhai, pack-up for today.
Today is the last day, Mahi.
The dates are locked.
Tell them l got food poisoning.
That's it, Aryan.
Hold her close...
more passion Aryan...
feel it...
hold her close...
Gayatri, look into his eyes.
Yes!
That's good!
Aryan, bring in more passion...
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
more passion.
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
Cut it! Cut it!
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
Hello Mahi...
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
- Arup...
- Yes, ma'am?
- Tell your boss that l'm in his van.
- Yes.
What's going on, Mahi?
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
You left your shoot to come here?
You didn't even tell me.
Are you spying on me?
Why? Can't l come?
Aryan, this love making scene
wasn't in the script.
There's only a month for the film's release.
And suddenly this scene pops up?
For God sake, Mahi.
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
The director thought this was crucial
for the second half...
so he added the scene.
ls that so?
Why didn't you tell me about it?
What does that mean?
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
Since when are we discussing
each other's scenes?
Why can't we?
We are even getting married soon.
The fact is you don't want to commit.
You want to keep
this macho playboy image...
and add such scenes
whenever you want to!
l can't believe this, Mahi.
l'm divorcing lsha.
What else do you want?
The divorce is not because of me.
We've been together for a year...
while you filed for your divorce
a year and a half ago.
l am not a fool.
l know everything,
okay?!
l don't know, Mahi...
how do l explain things...
l'm tired of your explanations.
l want a commitment...
do you understand that?
- lf you can't commit then...
- Then what?
Then what, Mahi?
lsha keeps nagging me
because of you and...
l can't deal with this, Mahi.
Mahi, l think we should
take a break.
We won't see each other
for a few days.
lt will give us both time to think.
Hopefully, until then my divorce
will also be through.
Let's see how it goes from there.
Aryan...
you know l didn't mean to say that.
l love you.
l hate that you keep this a secret.
At parties... you behave like a co-star.
lt scares me.
lt scares me a lot...
that you too will abandon me.
Why is this stuff so complicated?!
l just want us to be happy.
Please don't leave me,
please!
Please!
Hi Gayatri.
- Hi Rihan, how are you?
- How are you?
Good, come... sit.
What's going on? No gossip...
You have to give me something.
What's the latest inside scoop?
- You want some hot gossip?
- Yeah, baby, of course!
Come here.
Our shoot was interrupted
because of Mahi.
Oh really?
- This is tomorrow's headline.
- Okay!
Are you reading the book or
just looking at it...
like other actresses?
Very funny!
This is just not done.
Mahi, get hold of yourself.
Constant medication is not the answer.
Practice self-control.
Think positive... that's the best treatment.
Tanvi, right now l don't want a lecture.
l need my medication.
Are you writing the prescription...
or should l go somewhere else?
- Mahi...
- Write the damn prescription, will you!
Whatever!
And now...
the Best Debut of the Year - Female goes to...
the gorgeous, the beautiful...
Shaheen Khan!
Wow...
- Congratulations!
- Thank you so much!
- Well done.
- Thank you!
Thank you!
Thanks!
Debut of the year, wow!
Thanks to mom.
Thanks to my friends.
Thanks to my director.
Thank you so much.
This award is dedicated to
all the small town girls...
who dream to make it big in Bollywood.
That's it!
Her career is over.
How is that?
lt's bad luck.
My mom says, whoever got this award
never made it big.
l was also offered this award
but l refused.
And now, ladies and gentlemen...
The Monarch Universal
lifetime achievement award.
May l please call on stage...
the yesteryear legend...
Shagufta Rizvi.
And to present the award...
may l call on stage Mahi Arora and...
MD of Monarch Universal,
Mr. Hasmukh Thakur.
Congratulations Shaguftaji,
we are so happy for you.
Come please.
Thank you!
Good evening everyone.
People talk a lot after winning an award.
But l won't say a lot.
lf you start counting your memories,
their value fades away.
That's why,
l want to extend my gratitude to all the people...
who stood by me through everything...
and especially, to those who
didn't stand by me.
Because it is from them that
l learnt the most about life.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Akil bhai, nothing doing.
The deal was of 10 million
and an award.
You can't back out
at the last minute.
Listen Gayatri...
Everybody knows that
the 'Mahi and Aryan' pair is very popular.
They will get the
'Number one pair' award.
Popular, my foot!
Their pair if popular
only in the magazines.
My last picture with Aryan
was a super hit!
Especially overseas.
And, our next film as a pair
is out in two weeks.
lf l don't get this award...
l won't perform on stage.
You won't perform?
But Gayatri,
the award is decided by ajury.
- How can we...
- We can't do anything.
Okay.
Then why don't you get
the jury to perform.
Let me know.
Okay!
Come, let's talk to Aryan.
Hell yeah!
Hello beautiful...
- What?
- Make up, baby.
You look gorgeous.
Really?
What is it?
Nothing.
Just missing you.
- Really?
- Yes.
Coming into my room
just before a performance...
that means
you want something.
Tell me.
You really know me very well.
Actually... the thing is...
l have a request.
Aryan Khanna... A request...
This is serious.
Baby, the thing is...
my film with Gayatri
is due for release.
And the producer of the film
was wondering if the award...
that you and l were to get...
was given to Gayatri and me.
You know,
it would boost the publicity.
But that's...
that's only if it is okay with you.
Really.
What do you want?
Yes.
That's it?
l'd have said yes
even if you had sent a text.
Who cares about
a 'number one pair' award with you!
You and l are the real pair, right?
Always, my sweetheart.
- Make up!
- l don't care, baby.
- Prem, please cover that.
- lt's covered.
Look at dad, Akshat.
lt's quite dangerous
to perform such stunts.
How cool.
l will also become a hero like dad...
and do Superman movies!
- Of course you...
- Akshat!
How many times have l told you
not to talk to strangers.
You talk tojust about anybody!
Let's go!
Don't pull it.
lt goes off balance.
Stranger?
l mean, how dare she...
Relax.
Mahi... relax.
Just listen to me.
Aryan is with you.
He is divorcing lsha.
lt's obvious lsha is
venting her anger at you!
Andy...
Aryan should control lsha,
he didn't say a word to her.
How could he?
He was busy in the shoot.
He did not even know, darling.
Mahi, listen,
it doesn't matter what lsha does.
Aryan is serious about you.
Nothing else matters.
Bullshit!
lf he is so serious about you...
then why did he tell you not to attend
Rohan's anniversary party?
That's not what Aryan said.
All he said is, come to the party
after lsha leaves.
Right Mahi?
So tell me, what's wrong in that?
- Right Rats?
- lf you ask me, everything!
Mahi, Rohan is your co-star too.
And he has also invited you.
Why can't you attend?
Of course she can.
- But a little later.
- l don't think Mahi should go late...
That's nonsense Rats.
Why do you always have to
complicate things?
Seriously...
Oh, really?
Oh! Of course you are
looking fabulous.
You make a lovely couple.
Thank you so much, Abbas.
lt's our anniversary and
you are throwing this party!
lt's really sweet of you.
Don't be silly.
This was Zara's idea.
Thank my lovely wife.
Yeah totally.
These actresses are unbelievable!
She is cozing up to Rohan's wife...
to land a role in his next film.
Such a fraud!
Come on!
Who isn't!
Well, Rohan's wife was also an actress.
She want let it happen.
l like that!
l'll catch you around.
- Hey!
- Cheers!
Hey beautiful...
Shaheen Khan, she is hot.
What's the report?
Sameer Khan has been recommending her.
Really?
She is okay at acting
but nothing to be excited about.
l've heard that she doesn't meet
her co-stars after pack-up.
You know a lot about her.
Before that Danish Kapoor makes
a move on her...
l have to do a film with her.
Easy, Rohan.
lt's your first anniversary.
Or you'll end up using my divorce lawyer.
True!
Thank you, Angad.
Thank you so much.
l'm glad you took some time off
from the cricket series.
Oh come on!
You're like a sister to me.
l won a five day match in four,
just for you.
You're too sweet!
Come on guys, we have to
take a picture!
- Oh yeah!
- Anything for you Gayatri.
Hi Zara.
Mahi?
Sorry, l'm late.
Yeah.
Congratulations Sheena.
Thanks, Mahi.
lt's really not easy to spend
a year with Rohan.
You deserve an award for that.
Mahi, let's get you a drink.
l will help myself.
- Don't worry, Zara.
- Okay.
Guys, let's just chill.
- The worst thing that can ever..
- Hi!
Congratulations, Rohan.
What's up, Danish?
Hi Mahi...
Thanks, Mahi.
What a surprise!
Did you think l wouldn't come?
Have fun, Rohan.
Bye.
Yes ma'am.
- A glass of red wine, please.
- Sure.
Your drink ma'am.
What's this nonsense, Mahi?
l told you not to come here.
Please leave.
Why?
Rohan is my friend too.
l am invited as well.
Stop this drama and leave!
What's the problem?
Every one here knows about us.
Why do you hide it?
Mahi, this isn't the place
to talk about it.
Don't worry, Aryan.
lt doesn't matter how you treat me...
l won't embarrass you.
Because l love you.
Damn it, Mahi!
A vodka tonic please.
Sure sir.
Mahi, leaving so soon?
At least finish your drink.
There, l've finished it.
And by the way...
l'm not leaving!
lt's not my fault Aryan...
l couldn't help it.
You only think about your image.
Does it matter to you
what people say about me?
That l am a loser.
And l am sick of it.
l was on my way out.
But that b**** of a wife you have...
why did she have to talk to me?
What the f*** does she mean...
at least finish your drink!
She provoked me.
l had to do something.
You never say anything to her.
So l had to!
Aryan, say something.
Every time l talk about us...
you never say a word.
Can't you see,
it is driving me crazy?!
Aryan, l really need to know.
Do we have a future?
Or are you just using me?
l can't deal with this any more!
Aryan, this isn't a film.
Say something...
l need to know.
Why the f*** aren't you reacting??
You want me to f****** react?
Mahi, just get out.
What do you mean by
'get out'?
l mean just get out!
Well known actress Mahi Arora
was seen at the local police station.
lt's said that she was there to
lodge a complaint.
But nothing has been confirmed yet...
Yes, mom.
l told you...
don't trust that b******.
Please, not right now!
Why don't you come to Delhi for a few days?
Just to get away from all this mess.
No, l...
Mahi...
lt's unfortunate that you publish
any nonsense you want to.
So you can go ahead.
But, l'm saying this for the last time...
Mahi is only a co-star. Nothing more.
Superstar Aryan Khannajust confessed...
that Mahi is only a co-star.
Nothing more.
As ajournalist,
every time l analyzed Mahi's situation...
l couldn't help but think that she is stupid.
But every time l met her,
l only had compassion for her.
She was so lost...
So alone.
She had a bi-polar disorder.
She was looking for real emotions,
in a success crazed world.
But alas!
Her split with Aryan Khanna...
her own insecurities...
finally, the film industry.
They all supported Aryan.
After all he was a superstar.
Actors that Mahi had helped in the past...
also abandoned her.
They all ruined her.
Mahi...
you can only lose to others when
you've lost to yourself.
You always look for happiness in others.
That's your problem.
Look for happiness in your work.
Concentrate on your career.
You just have to stop playing the victim.
Take charge!
Declare to the world,
that Mahi Arora is not over.
Hi...
l am Pallavi Narayan.
Hi...
Will you have something?
No, thanks.
Mahi...
l'm not your regular PR person.
l build images.
l make brands.
But l am already a brand.
You are...
but a fading brand.
You have two small budget films...
some mid-level endorsements.
lf you don't take charge,
you will soon be over.
l have prepared a rough strategy for you
for the next year.
The first three months
we will build your image.
The next quarter we will get some,
A-list endorsements for you.
And then...
focus on some A-list films and
by the end of the year...
you will be back!
Bingo!
With a brand new image.
When the old image is so strong...
how can we build a new one?
You will do it.
lf you say something confidently...
then film industry even takes
the lie for a truth.
Your image is very confusing.
Neither a wild child
nor conventional.
The film industry doesn't like
confusing images.
But now that's over.
Your image will be of a
powerful star.
Who will be very confident
about her every move.
No matter what's troubling you...
always look confident.
You have to be a player now.
l will have a...
Vodka with coconut water.
How do you know?.
l know a lot about you.
Your favorite color,
turquoise blue.
Your favorite non-vegetarian food,
lamb ribs.
Your favorite holiday destination,
Koh Samui.
Don't worry.
l'm not stalking you.
Film magazines help me fall asleep.
Hi... Angad Paul.
Who doesn't know you?!
Vice-captain of the lndian Cricket team.
You know, we've seen each other
at some parties.
Last time, at Zara's party.
l know.
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
l didn't want to bring it up...
l know, it was embarrassing.
You probably thought l was a
drama queen!
No,
l thought you have a lot of guts.
So, everything good now?.
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
Everything's not good...
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
but l am.
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
l have moved on.
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
And, how's Gayatri?
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
You know... moved on.
l am so sorry.
Why sorry?
l'm not sorry at all.
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
Even our drama was
all over the newspapers.
Didn't you read?
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
l don't read newspapers and magazines.
Why?
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
Who knows what people
are saying about us!
Cheers to that.
Cheers.
Alex, isn't Mahi looking gorgeous?
She is,
but how does it matter?
Who will sign her?
She's moody, impulsive,
over-emotional.
Alex, whether its
Hollywood or Bollywood...
every legendary actress has
these three qualities.
Oh yeah!
Now, no one can stop her.
Hope she survives.
From whom?
Herself!
Angad, you are crazy!
That's why you and l will get along well.
l think l should leave now.
l just had to be here.
l couldn't help it.
Thank you for rescuing me
from this boring party.
lf you wish,
l can rescue you every day.
What are you doing tomorrow?.
Anyway, whatever you were to do,
cancel it.
Really?
Tomorrow is my cricket match,
you must come.
lt will be fun.
Why?
Why...
Because if you do,
we will definitely win.
l'll think about it.
l'll try.
Good night.
Wow, Mahi!
lnvitation to the match.
That's great publicity.
Clever move.
Pallavi, that wasn't a move.
lf it wasn't, then it should be.
You have to go there tomorrow.
Go to the match.
And make sure
you are seen with him.
Angad Paul is a great catch.
Pallavi, he is a really nice guy.
But to manipulate him...
Mahi Arora...
this is the film industry.
Either you manipulate
or get manipulated.
The choice is yours, babes!
- Thanks, Lobo.
- Your welcome sir.
l was under a lot of pressure before the sixer.
So what did you do?
lf l can't concentrate, l sing.
When the bowler is taking his run-up,
l start singing.
At that time l was singing...
Khoya Khoya Chand...
Khula aasmaan...
...and then took a shot!
You really are mad!
By the way,
my team is grateful to you for my century.
And so am l.
Grateful?
Excuse me.
Yes..
Mahi...
in exactly ten minutes,
leave the restaurant.
And don't forget...
look surprised.
Yes, l will see you soon.
Okay, yeah bye.
What is it?
Nothing. Let's go?
Sure.
Yes, we will meet tomorrow.
Yeah!
Shaguftaji...
how are you?
How are you, Mahi?
l'm alright,
l was shooting on the next floor.
What are you doing here?
l have a shoot on this floor.
Why are you sitting here, in this heat?
Where's your van?
l guess l don't have one.
Since it's only a three day job,
l didn't get one...
You didn't?
- Excuse me!
- Yeah!
- are you from the production team?
- Yes.
Take care of that.
Yes, ma'am.
Where's Shaguftaji's van?
- Don't worry Mahi...
- What do l say!
The producer's wife keeps a tab
on every little thing.
A van for a character artist?
You tell me?
l am helpless.
l am sorry.
Shaguftaji, please come with me...
l'll manage.
When the shot is ready,
you can fetch her from my van.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Shaguftaji, please come.
Mahi, why do you get so upset?
l am used to these things.
We didn't have these vans
when l was a young star.
We would open an umbrella, sit under it...
and start shooting.
lt must've been difficult back then...
no privacy?
l don't know, Mahi.
The entire film unit would
do things together.
Directors, heroes, heroines,
side actors, junior artists...
everyone had a good time.
That's why nothing seemed difficult,
l guess.
ln those days,
relationships were valued a lot.
These days its fame and success.
But don't we become actors
for fame and success?
Yes, we do.
Whatever fame gives us...
it takes away a lot more from us.
We fail to see in the glow of glamour...
how much we have lost.
When we realize it, it's often too late.
Everything is on schedule.
l am so happy, Mahi.
Seven A-list endorsements
in four months.
11 high profile events and
you are on every cover page.
l think we are on the right track.
lt's all thanks to you, Pallavi.
That's all very nice but
you are essentially a heroine.
You have to sign a film.
Rashid bhai!
l think he is absolutely right.
A heroine gets commercials and
endorsements based on her films.
And, it's high time you signed a film.
Abbas Khan...
is making the remake of
a super hit South lndian film.
He's also shooting the entire film abroad.
lf you get this film...
you are home!
But l've heard that
he is considering Rhea Mehra.
Gayatri is also desperate to get it.
So, what are my chances?
We will know the answer to that
only if you try.
lt's very simple.
Either you join Rhea and Gayatri in the race...
and defeat them.
Or sit here and accept defeat.
lt's up to you.
Mind blowing.
Excellent shot.
We will set up for the next shot?
Yes, sure.
Okay!
l'm at a shoot, mom.
Talk to you later.
Just a minute, it's urgent.
Pratap's political party is organizing
a cleanliness drive in Mumbai.
He wants you to attend the event.
Forjust 10 minutes,
as the chief guest.
Tell him to contact Rashid bhai
and to finalize a deal in 2 million.
What? Are you crazy?
You will charge your mother?
That too for a social cause?
Stop over reacting, mom.
lt's the ruling party and they are loaded.
l'm doing it for 2 only for you
otherwise l charge 3 million!
Mahi, please.
l've promised Pratap.
You know...
Mom, l don't have time for this.
We'll talk later.
Surekha, come on.
Yes.
Rhea has been celebrating her
25th birthday for the past five years!
Surekha...
They write such things about every heroine.
No, you don't know.
She is very shrewd.
l know her since she was
a struggling model.
She knows very well how to be at the right place,
at the right time.
She will do anything to achieve her goal.
Madam...
Anything.
She is at least 31 years old.
She forged her age in her
birth certificate and passport.
l know it.
lt's true.
Remember the film 'Bad Boys'?
She made a passport before that film.
Anyway, what have l got to do with it.
l like to focus on my job.
l'm not at all interested in such gossip.
l forgot something...
the flowers!
Madam, l'll get the flowers.
Hi mom...
what were you saying about
Pratap Khurana's rally?
Fine, tell him l will do it.
Done deal.
Long live, Pratap Khurana!
Mahi...
l request Mahi to say a few words.
Thank you!
Actually, l don't know a lot about politics.
But what l do know is that...
a cleanliness drive is important for every city.
l'm happy that Pratapji and the national party
have organized this.
And l shall begin
the drive from his constituency.
Say it with me...
Clean Mumbai, Healthy Mumbai!
Thanks, Mahi.
l know film stars get paid a lot
to attend events like this one.
But you're doing this only for your mother.
l am really grateful to you.
Any time, Pratap uncle.
Let me know if l can ever help in any way.
Thanks.
Actually, l'd like a small favor.
Of course.
There's this actress, Rhea Mehra.
She has forged her age in her passport.
l think, if you could alert the authorities...
Yes, no problem. l will do that.
Shinde, hand me the passport.
What's the matter, officer?
Madam, you have to come with us.
But what's the problem?
We need to question you.
Get her.
Please come.
The breaking news at the moment.
Airport immigration authorities
have detained actress Rhea Mehra...
for forging her age in her passport.
Rhea Mehra was on her way to Paris
with her friends to celebrate her birthday.
Sources tell us that until the enquiry is through,
Rhea Mehra can't travel overseas.
We tried contacting her,
but could not get through.
Nice?
Very nice.
l think it's perfect.
- What do you think?
- lt's beautiful.
l am very happy.
You are looking beautiful.
Why don't you try the other
three outfits too, please.
But that commercial is after 10 days.
lt's fine.
l know but l want to finish the alteration soon.
Thanks to Rhea's passport controversy...
Gayatri is doing Abbas' next film.
And that diva!
She won't wear any of Rhea's outfits.
She has changed the entire look.
Two weeks before the shoot!
Just imagine, l am so harrowed...
Mahi, what's wrong?
What?
l don't know, l was just wondering...
Does Abbas have a problem with me?
Even l wanted that role.
l sent Abbas a long text...
but he didn't reply.
Weird!
Michelle, excuse us for a minute, please.
Sure.
Thank you.
A text to Abbas? Are you crazy?
Abbas cannot reply to any heroine's text.
lf he does, his wife Zara will kill him.
Yeah!
After his affair with Christina,
Zara gave him an ultimatum.
lf he does any hanky-panky with any heroine...
he will be a dead man.
ln fact, Zara handles the casting of
heroines for Abbas' films.
She chose Gayatri.
See, it's just between you and me.
Don't say it was me.
Just telling you as a friend,
okay?
Let's try other outfits.
Come on...
Michelle..
This is your third cigarette.
Why are you so tense?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
What's the matter, my dear?
Work stress, Angad.
My career is going downhill.
What nonsense!
Film offers are pouring in.
You're doing commercials.
Media is writing about us.
What else do you want?
The films offered are not interesting.
Commercials don't really help.
You will be fine.
Angad, l never do this but...
l'm comfortable with you and
so l'm saying this.
Please talk to Zara for me.
Abbas is doing Nikhil Anand's film.
lf Zara's recommends,
Abbas won't refuse.
But Mahi...
l've never discussed
Abbas' professional life with Zara.
lt's a bit weird, you know.
l know.
But l believe l am perfect for this role.
Abbas has signed Gayatri and
you know how she is.
Anyway, forget it.
l don't want to force you.
What's the worst that could happen?
My career will be over.
And l'll end up buying a cricket team
with some businessman!
What else?
Zara...
You know Abbas and l know Gayatri.
She is a slut.
You know about outdoor shoots.
Abbas' affair with Christina?
You plan on going back to your mother again?
Angad, all actresses are like that.
Who can you trust?
l mean, we need an actress.
There is one safe option,
Mahi.
Abbas knows she is seeing me,
he will be careful.
With all due respect,
Mahi is no saint either.
l've heard and seen a lot about her.
But now she is with me.
You know l am serious about her.
Otherwise l wouldn't be here.
Angad, don't you like anyone
apart from actresses?
The others aren't as beautiful.
Please talk to Abbas about Mahi.
For me, please!
Please talk to Abbas.
For me, please!
Head and Shoulders
Shampoo and Conditioner.
Cut please!
We are done with this shot.
Thank you!
Okay, so l'll wait in the van.
Go for your next change.
Your call.
Hi...
You are joking!
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Yeah!
l will see you in the evening.
Bye.
Hi Pallavi... Angad called.
l have some breaking news.
l'm Abbas Khan's heroine in
Nikhil Anand's next film.
Spread the word!
Angad, is it?
No.
You know something,
Nikhil is a slave driver.
He's made us work for
seven days straight.
l mean, it's an outdoor shoot,
and not even a day's break.
Totally exhausted.
Anyway, l'm calling for an
early pack-up today.
Need to relax.
l want a glass of red wine.
Hey... you like red wine, right?
Yeah.
ln fact,
some fan here gave me this bottle of a...
50 year old Chateau Margaux.
Wow.
l would hate to have it alone.
Why don't you come over to my room.
We'll have it together.
What's wrong?
You see...
l'm on antibiotics.
So, l can't drink wine.
For how long?
About three days.
That's not a problem.
Today is Tuesday, we'll have it on Friday.
l'll tell Nikhil to give the crew
a day off on Saturday.
So that we will have
all the time on Friday night.
Good idea.
Coming...
Hey!
Hi.
Looking gorgeous.
Thank you.
Come in.
Surprise!
What's up, man!
What do you think?
Mahi got this idea to surprise you.
Fantastic!
Come...
Hey.
l have to say, Abbas.
Of all your heroines,
Mahi is my favorite.
Yes l agree.
From now, Mahi is my favorite too.
- Come...
- Yeah!
So what are you love birds upto?
Red wine, Mahi?
Sure.
Nice, very nice.
Abbas, getting Gayatri to do an item number
was a fab idea.
l know.
The first trailer should feature only this song.
ln fact, the publicity for the film should...
only focus on this item number.
Also, get a poster featuring only Gayatri.
Solo poster?
But Mahi is the heroine.
And the hero?
This film is on my shoulders.
Mahi is yours.
Deal with it.
Wow!
You were fantastic, baby!
Thanks, dear!
- You are a genius, Abbas.
- Great job!
You did it man.
Thanks brother.
Hey... That was amazing,
l am so proud of you.
You look hot!
Great!
Abbas just rocked again.
Outstanding!
Thank you.
- Congrats, sir.
- Thank you.
50 million weekend opening! l'd predicted this.
Thank you!
Sir, mark my words,
your film will touch 1.5 billion, at least!
You suggested Mahi for our film.
She hardly had eight scenes and
she didn't even act well.
Alex, she looks lovely.
Oh come on!
We need an actress.
Not some... decoration. Mahi is out.
Congratulations, Abbas.
You did it.
No, Mahi, we did it.
Gayatri... Lucky mascot of my film.
Come... come.
There you are.
l'm glad you agreed to do this item song.
Thanks!
And you really rock,
you know that?
Come on Abbas!
Anything for you.
What is it, Mahi?
lt's not fair, Nikhil.
l'm barely visible in the film.
Mahi, you know Abbas.
Once the shoot is over,
right from editing to publicity design...
Abbas controls everything.
He cut me out of the editing too.
You know what, Mahi, cheer up.
Look around... at the public reaction.
The trade guys are predicting
a 1.5 billion business!
And, in our industry, only hits matter.
That's the success mantra, right?
Mahi, you were brilliant.
Absolutely mind blowing
Thank you!
Announce a sequel.
lt has to rock.
Nikhil, Gayatri's item number
was a killer.
Thanks.
- Congratulations bro.
- Thanks bro!
Second half was mind blowing,
this film will make 1 billion.
Mahi looks upset.
Her role was reduced to nothing.
lt's obvious.
She pissed off Abbas, Aryan...
if she does this to every hero...
she will end up
a thumbnail on the posters.
Mahi.
Let's go.
Calm down, Mahi.
What do you mean, calm down?
Not one good review.
The critics are saying, 'Abbas Khan is the star
and Mahi is just a showpiece'!
My role was chopped off!
The film is a super hit,
and that's all that matters.
You've got three calls
for endorsements!
You've been offered two major films.
Pallavi...
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
am l a good actress?
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
Come on, Mahi.
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
Answer the damn question.
Am l a good actress?
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
Or not?
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
Mahi, you are a star.
You don't need to be an actress.
l do.
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
l do, indeed.
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
Mahi Arora.
You're a big star.
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
Why do you want to do
a Tapan Guha film?
You know l'm
an eccentric film maker.
My next film, Tarranum Jaan,
is about a prostitute.
lt has sex...
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
abusive language.
l make realistic films...
while you're a commercial heroine.
l work on a small budget.
And stars like you have
a thousand issues.
l promise, Tapanda,
that won't happen.
Listen, this is my
first Hindi language film.
You won't have free dates...
your price is a problem.
l have a start-to-finish schedule.
You can't take up
any other work for six months.
What say?
You decide the dates
and the price.
When do we start?
Keep it properly.
Dada, how's it going?
The traffic in Mumbai...
Ma'am, sit.
Hi!
l am Promita.
Of course, Promita Roy.
Oh, please sit.
You know, Mahi...
l am so glad you're doing this film.
lt's a kickass script and
your role is superb.
l know but l'm not sure
if l can do this.
- Why?
- lt's the first time l'm doing such a film and...
l haven't won as many awards as you.
Please!
l don't take these
awards and critics seriously.
Perhaps that's why they take me seriously.
You know, Mahi...
this film will transform
your glamorous image.
l'm a regular fixture in dada's films.
l've done four films with him...
and that's why l'm in this too.
What's that term...
Special appearance!
Alok, get me a cigarette.
Mahi...
Don't smoke in public
or this isn't your brand?
Let's go over the lines.
Promita, lt is not just lines...
concentrate on your acting.
Hey, you please switch off your phone.
Concentrate on your scene.
Do you remember your last line?
We will be zooming in.
No, i don't want.
Cut! Cut it!
Mahi, feel the complexity of the emotions...
Please lie down.
Listen, l am the customer
who is looking at you.
Mahi...
Yes, dada.
Now we will shoot scene 20.
This is a four-page scene.
We will shoot one shot,
one scene, no cut.
You have to memorize all your lines...
and you have one hour.
Here, get started.
But... one hour?
This is how small budget films are.
Cut down on the BBM
and concentrate on your work.
Hi!
Hi! When did you arrive?
That's a cold reaction.
l thought you'd be happy to see me.
Of course, l am.
lt's just that l'm drained
and l've a four-page scene.
Excuses!
l called you, l sent texts...
you didn't answer.
This isn't a match
to keep score of the calls.
Oh please!
Look, this is an intense film.
l have to concentrate on
my performance every day!
You're lucky.
lf l don't talk to you,
l can't concentrate on my performance.
That's why l keep calling you.
All season l was...
l am sorry.
l forgive you!
Surprise!
We've been dating for a year.
lt's time to get married.
My family is also happy for us.
Angad...
l don't know what to say...
Say, 'yes'!
Look, l really appreciate it...
but right now, l'm just not in
the frame of mind.
l need some time.
Of course, baby.
You can take all the time you want.
But say yes, my dear.
What are you saying?
Don't tell me what to do.
One day no budget forjunior artist,
the next day, cut down on shoot days.
And you expect me to make a film?
l've made five films!
And four have won the National award.
l know this is my first Hindi feature film,
but do not take me for granted.
l've seen the rubbish you've
made with big stars.
Tell your bosses...
they can't make a film sitting in
the comfort of an AC room.
l sweat and toil to make a film.
l know that, dada...
Do not disturb me on the set like this.
Dada, listen...
Let me concentrate, please!
Now what?
l'll sort this, don't worry!
Partho!
Action!
You slut!
You're stealing my customer.
Hey! l don't need to steal.
He chose me.
You're lying.
This is the third customer you've taken.
Stop doing that or
l'll smash your face so bad...
you'll look scary in the dark too.
Cut it!
What is wrong, Mahi?
You sound like a machine.
Feel the character.
You are not Mahi, the heroine...
here you are my character,
Tarranum, the prostitute.
Feel the character.
This kind of acting is fine for Bollywood,
not for my cinema.
Make her more real.
Realism.
You bloody idiot!
Give me that phone.
Get out, go and kneel down.
Where was l...
No, can't happen like this.
Pack up!
Just relax, Mahi.
The thing with dada is...
he wants realism in everything.
And he feels you can't portray that realism.
But, relax, it will come.
l don't know what dada wants me to do.
l know.
Get dressed and come with me.
Come on! Get ready.
A lot of foreigners come here.
l mean, what do you call that
oh yes, documentary.
- Come here, handsome!
- Don't worry about anything.
Come.. come..
Don't worry about anything.
Promita, what place is this?
l am scared.
Don't be scared.
Just get in.
Aren't you...
the 'Halkat Jawani' girl?
Yes!
Mahi Arora.
l mean...
you are a fabulous dancer.
Can l get you some tea?
No, thanks, madam.
We are here to observe you.
We are shooting for a film.
And we're playing characters, just like you.
Really?
So you are here to study our mannerisms.
How these girls live, eat, abuse...
how they go about their profession.
All of you, listen to me.
These heroines here...
are saying that they will play our part.
lf you take up ourjob...
what will we do?
Well said, Hamida bai.
Well said!
Anyway
you can watch us all you want.
We are open for business.
Another thing...
we won't charge you to watch us...
unlike your movies.
- Don't you agree?
- Yes, madam.
Go on, you can talk to the girls here.
- Valli bhai...
- Yes, madam?
- Why don't you call for some kebabs?
- Absolutely!
Get it from Habib's counter.
Hamida bai...
the police are all over the place.
This way, quick.
l will lead you out through the back door.
Hurry up!
Let them out through the other exit.
This way.
Quick!
So, how was the research?
Wasn't it exciting?
Research?
Promita, you are crazy!
Being crazy is part of the excitement.
lt was an adventure.
That's what makes us better actors.
You need to relax, Mahi.
l need a drink.
Come on, let's go to my place.
You know...
you are a good actress, Mahi.
The pain that's within you is what
you need to express on screen.
Then you'll be miles ahead of everyone.
Never mind.
How many boyfriends have you had?
Don't look so shocked.
l'm sure you keep a count.
l've had 17.
The serious ones!
Don't worry, l don't want an answer.
You are beautiful.
By 4 take 2.
Action!
l told that jerk.
'You want it,
you do it here'.
'l'm not coming to some cheap hotel'.
Cut it!
Very good.
That was good.
Very good.
Mahi, very good. Very nice.
What's the next shot?
By 2 Take 1!
That was nothing!
Now, listen to this.
A slut has four admirers.
One in the north, one in the east...
one in the west and
another in the south!
lmpressive, Tarranum Jaan.
Cut it!
Don't hit me.
Bloody theif!
- This is wrong.
- Get out!
Slimy jerk!
How dare you don't pay!
Cut it! Okay!
Very nice shot, Mahi.
Very good.
Very nice, Mahi.
- Very nice, isn't it?
- Absolutely!
Give me the script.
Mahi, please listen to me.
What happened that night, it was nothing.
lt was just a moment.
For God sake, l'm not a lesbian.
Anyway...
my special appearance...
today was the last of it.
l'm going back to Kolkata.
lt was great working with you.
l am sorry that we couldn't be friends.
l wish you all the best, take care.
Promita...
you take care.
Thanks.
Mom, stop it.
We had fun this weekend.
l shouldn't have come to drop you.
Mahi, getting irritated won't help.
You know l am saying the truth.
You know it's not easy
taking such decisions.
Why not?
You always complained that
Aryan wasn't ready to commit.
Now when Angad wants to marry you...
what's the problem?
Don't you love him?
Of course, l love him.
But right now,
l want to concentrate on my career.
He also has his career.
What's the rush?
Mahi...
whether you marry Angad or not,
is your decision.
But let me make this clear.
Tell Angad what's in your heart.
Don't keep him hanging.
Don't do to him what Aryan did to you.
Get it?
l knew it!
Everybody told me that you won't marry me.
l didn't want to accept.
Try to understand.
l'm not saying l don't want to marry you.
All l'm saying is right now we need to
give time to our careers.
What's the rush?
You wasted a whole year with that excuse!
How much more time do you want?
lt's all nonsense.
Just excuses!
When you heroines have love,
you chase a career...
when you make it big, you want love!
You greedy women!
lt's not that your career will end
if you were to marry me!
l was ajerk!
Angad!
l thought you were different.
l thought you weren't happy,
l wanted to rescue you...
l loved you, Mahi.
Angad, please!
Enough is enough!
l can't do this anymore.
Actresses like you can't love someone.
You can only act as if you do.
Please, relax.
You only know how to use others.
l don't want you anymore!
l don't want you anymore!
Hello...
What?!
Tapanda, you can't do this.
How can you shelve this film?
You can't shelve this film.
l can do anything l want.
Bloody corporate film makers!
They're trying to teach a National award
winning director to make a film!
Sometimes they say the film is serious,
sometimes they want humor.
They want to add an item number...
Bloody no aesthetic sense!
Teaching me to make a film!
l will talk to them. l'll sort everything.
No, it won't help.
l've decided l'm not making this film.
But...
how can we shelve this film now?.
Because of this film...
l sacrificed all other work!
Now you're walking away from it!
Mahi!
Tapanda, please!
l have lost all patience.
l know you've put in a lot of effort for this film.
l know you've sacrificed a lot,
but everything is not lost.
This experience will...
make you a better actress.
Tapanda, please!
That's when you'll thank me.
Bless you.
Tapanda...
Gracy, just get out.
Pull the blinds.
Just go!
They say...
to make good friends,
you have to be one yourself.
Unfortunately film stars can't think of anyone
but themselves.
lf Mahi had a true friend...
she wouldn't have been so scared...
wouldn't have made so many mistakes.
Tarranum Jaan was a big mistake.
And Mahi resorted to punishing herself.
She was ruined.
Her rivals and newcomers
replaced her.
Shagufta Rizvi was the only person
with whom Mahi felt at peace.
When l met her during that time,
l wrote...
that Mahi had brought
this upon herself.
lt didn't matter
whose fault it was...
it still hurt.
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
Poor Mahi.
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
The things she did to get rid of her pain.
So, what have you decided?
We've heard that you
are seeing a psychiatrist.
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
You have also mentioned that
you drink regularly.
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
So...
Having scrutinized your family background
and your professional life...
the adoption panel has concluded that...
you are incapable of being a single parent.
lncapable?
What do you mean?
How did they decide?
Have they ever seen me... met me?
Some forms tell you
l am not capable?!
Tell me, sister.
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
Tell me.
Mahi...
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
To become a good parent,
you need patience and emotional control.
Qualities which you clearly don't have.
Practice for a few more years...
and apply again.
Good day.
Sister, you can't do this.
Sister, you can't do this.
This is wrong.
l will sue you.
Do you understand?!
Yes, l take psychiatric help...
Yes l drink, so what?
Let's go...
come on!
So what?
l'm not fit to be a mother?
Let's go...
l will sue you!
Hi Mahi.
What is this, Pallavi?
You should be happy.
So what if you couldn't adopt,
at least you are on the front page.
You need to pay
to get such coverage.
What nonsense!
How could you release
this story without my consent?
Excuse me?
Since when do l need your consent?
You've forgotten the time...
when l made you sneeze into a storm?
You didn't object then...
there was no problem.
Because this is my personal life.
Wake up, Mahi!
ln this industry, there's no difference between your
professional and personal life.
Your life...
is public property.
l used it to plan your comeback.
And now you've ruined it.
Thanks to my PR skills,
you still make headlines...
and that makes you interesting.
What else do you have?
No films, no relationships...
actually, nothing!
Get out!
Right now!
You are fired.
And don't ever show me your bloody face.
Get out!
Can't face the truth, can you?
Someone has rightly said...
There are people and
then there are actors.
Mukesh, Mahi has given you
two super hits.
One with Rohan.
She deserves to do another film
with you. Please.
Rashid bhai, you know very well that...
things in the film industry change every Friday.
Mahi's last hit was with Abbas.
And that was a year ago.
Moreover she's not on good terms
with the heroes.
Not just me, no hero
would want to work with her.
Not to forget that crazy phase...
that film on prostitutes...
Tarranum Jaan!
She wasted nine months.
Nine months!
ln these nine months so many
fresh faces have been launched.
The industry waits for no one.
Mahi is neither professional,
nor a box office success.
l have a suggestion.
Tell Mahi to do a reality series.
Or marry a rich NRl.
Mukesh, look at this...
South of France.
Mind blowing.
Superb, isn't it?
Great job, fantastic.
Alright, Mukesh. See you.
Mahi...
the lifespan of a heroine is
quite short in our industry.
lf you sit here doing nothing,
you'll lose that too.
What can l do, Rashid bhai?
Nobody is giving me any work.
There's a good script,
it's a small budget film.
The director and producer are new.
What's that term...
New wave cinema.
Shall l fix a meeting?
There's also an offer
to make an appearance.
At the wedding of an industrialist's daughter...
you'll be the bride's friend.
The money is good.
What do you say?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Here is your seat ma'am.
Alright!
Here is your boarding pass.
Thank you.
l'll get it for you.
Thank you.
Hi...
Won't you invite me in?
You look beautiful.
l know, l have hurt you a lot.
l often thought about talking to you.
But l just couldn't.
Then l saw you on the flight and...
l realized how much l missed you.
We were so happy.
What do you want, Aryan?
l love you, Mahi.
After we broke up, l realized that...
l know what you're thinking.
After we broke up, l had three affairs.
You know what...
l...
l kept comparing them to you.
And l was disappointed.
They were just not like us.
l really love you, Mahi.
Why?
Why now?.
Because no one ever loved me like you did.
l know...
l know all of this seems sudden.
But, really... think about it.
We were really good together.
Please, come on.
l would've done the same if l were you.
So, l guess this is it then.
You are precious, Mahi.
Take care.
Aryan.
l am so sorry...
l am so sorry.
l am so sorry.
ln the battle between the heart and the mind,
the heart has always won.
ln any case, Mahi never followed her mind.
Mahi and Aryan patched up...
and her career restarted
with a small budget film, 'Annie'.
Aryan was serious about her,
but Mahi was not sure.
The wounds of her past were still fresh and...
she found accepting this difficult.
Though Mahi was living with Aryan,
she wasn't with him.
Having a rough day, Mahi?
Not at all.
l've noticed you don't seem happy...
not as much as you should.
Mahi...
How will l know if you don't tell me?
l don't know...
There's this fear that...
if l'm too happy...
all this will end.
The past...
keeps haunting me.
Listen, Mahi...
things need time to heal.
We need to give some time...
to our relationship, to each other.
for things to be normal.
l think l have a plan.
Let's do a film together.
A big budget period film.
Alex and l are producing it.
On that pretext...
we will be together.
That will be our comeback.
What do you think?
l think we will have a blast.
Please, Andy, don't tell anyone about this film.
Aryan hasn't made it official yet.
lt is a period film and l want you to
research the costumes thoroughly!
Anyway, Andy, we'll talk later.
Yeah!
See you later.
Hello ma'am.
Please sit.
Thank you.
Mr. Nair, Annie is due for release in two weeks
but there's no publicity.
There's no buzz.
The promos are aired a few times
but not on all channels.
How will that help?
What can l say.
We had allocated 30 million for the publicity but
you had the climax reshot.
The publicity funds were used for that.
But the new climax has improved the film.
Anyway, now we have to be aggressive.
Get a new PR company.
Radio, TV...
the publicity of Annie should be all over.
This film...
has to be a hit!
Definitely. We will try our best.
We have to!
We're investing 1.5 billion for this film.
lt's already a very risky project.
We can't afford to increase
the risk by signing Mahi.
She is over, Aryan.
What?
l am sorry.
l didn't mean that.
But our company is new.
This is our first film.
We need a blockbuster.
Everything should be new.
Music, casting, locations, everything!
The audience has seen you and Mahi.
And they love us.
They used to.
Come on!
The audience always wants
a new lead pair.
l spoke with the distributors.
They will buy into it if we sign Shaheen Khan.
She has had two super hit films.
She is the star of the moment.
And she has got dates.
You discussed this with her?
Relax.
l sort of talked to her secretary.
Alex, l've promised this film to Mahi.
And l am really serious about it.
Yes, l can see that.
No wonder you're getting emotional.
But, please Aryan...
l'd suggest you keep your
professional and personal life separate.
Don't mix them.
Besides, l'm not saying
you shouldn't work with Mahi.
We will adjust her in our next film.
She is not right for this film.
Look at the budget.
Just think about it.
Very less corwd.
What will we say?
l couldn't help it.
There are two major events,
so they've gone there.
They promised they'll show up...
let's see.
You should've changed
the press conference dates.
This doesn't make sense.
Sorry, Mahi.
Shall we start.
Mahi, are you marrying Aryan?
Does that mean, you will retire?
We are here to talk about 'Annie'.
Let's concentrate on this.
No personal questions, please...
l request you to stick
to professional questions.
You are right, Mahi.
So, let's talk about your professional life.
So answer this professional question...
There are rumors that you had signed
Aryan's home production...
and now you've been replaced by Shaheen.
ls this because you are
not the star you once were?
Your response?
Actually, you journalists should write film scripts.
The stories you create to get back!
lf a heroine buys a car, its a gift from a businessman.
lf she buys a diamond, she is engaged.
lf she goes to a hospital, she's getting an abortion.
lf she visits LA, it's for plastic surgery.
God forbid if she goes to Dubai...
you create a rate card for her!
People should learn to make stories from you!
You are digressing.
You still haven't answered my question.
You do know you're no longer part of
Aryan's home production, don't you?
That is not true.
l am the heroine in Aryan's film.
There's your answer!
Any questions about Annie?
Any question?
l guess not.
So, let's wrap this up.
Mahi...
Mahi please...
What attitude!
She has gone mad.
What nonsense is this.
Yes, Rats?
Mahi, l've been calling you...
why didn't you answer?
l was at the press conference.
That's precisely why l wanted to talk to you.
Everybody is saying that Shaheen has replaced you.
l know.
Tamanna asked the same thing.
lt's true.
l just spoke to Shaheen's secretary.
They have even discussed the dates.
Shaheen is doing Aryan's film, not you!
l will talk to you later.
Do you want me to twist my ankle?
Come on Aryan.
Give us some easy steps.
We need to talk.
Now!
Just a minute.
You are lying, Aryan.
Did you talk to Alex?
No, l told you l didn't talk to Alex.
You didn't?
That means l am still doing your film?
Okay, listen...
l talked to him...
See! l knew it!
Baby, please listen to me.
l talked to him but we didn't decide.
He wanted to sign Shaheen.
And that got you excited!
Couldn't you tell him that l am doing this film?
You are still doing this film.
Let me talk to Alex.
Fine, talk. Do it now.
Relax, Mahi.
l will do that in my time.
Everything will be fine.
Liar!
You said the same thing when
you were with lsha.
l shouldn't have trusted you.
You are a cheat.
Liar!
Bloody b******!
Relax, Mahi!
lt's not as big as you're making it out to be.
Really?
Then why don't you say that
l am the heroine of your film?
Because l need to talk to Alex.
There are many other decisions.
After all the budget is 1.5 billion.
Relax, l'm telling you l will sort this out.
l'm not a star anymore...
that's why you're doing this.
Baby, that's not true.
Really, then tell me...
that l am the heroine of your film!
Mahi, listen.
Tell me now!
Am l the heroine of your film or not?
You are for me!
Wow!
What an answer!
You care about no one!
Come on, Mahi!
l just knew it, you care about no one.
Alex, l told you l wasn't sure about Shaheen.
Then why is the media talking about it?
You know how the media is.
A mere mention
and they create headlines!
What nonsense!
No one apart from you knew about this.
Anyway, l can only do this film with Mahi.
Why are you getting so emotional about Mahi?
This is not an emotional decision.
Go through the script. Mahi is perfect for the part.
Either we do this film with Mahi.
Or we don't!
Okay?
Aryan...
Silly chap.
Ram...
Aryan Khanna's film is shelved.
Come on, Mahi...
pick up.
Come on, pick up...
- What's wrong, sir?
- Nothing.
Sir, your ticket to Delhi.
You have to go from here,
we're running late.
Just cancel this, please.
Sir, how can l cancel it?
People are expecting you.
How dare he...
Mahi is a star!
l will not spare him.
l'll show that b******.
l am not over.
Yes, Mahi?
Where are you?
l'm at home. What is it?
Come to my place.
Now?.
Yes, right now!
Please.
That's not possible.
Pallavi, l need you here,
right now.
Mahi, what's the matter?
l will tell you when you get here.
Come here now.
lt's too late...
l cannot come.
Forget the damn time!
Pallavi, come here.
Right now!
Alright, Mahi, calm down.
l'll be there.
That b****** Aryan!
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
He has signed Shaheen for his film.
Pallavi, you have to do something.
l need 'Annie' to be a hit.
This film has to work, professionally
and personally.
l am sorry, Mahi.
There's nothing l can do.
'Annie' will hit theatres in two days.
Even if you start a publicity campaign
and spend on marketing...
it won't help this film.
You have to do it.
Please Pallavi.
Please!
You are my only hope.
Think of a gimmick.
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
You have to do it
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
'Annie' has to be a success.
At least on the day of release.
<b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b>
'Annie' is a small budget film...
centered around a woman.
Only a controversy can get people
to watch this film...
but, we have nothing.
l don't care!
You can do it.
l know, only you can do it!
l know...
l know, you can do it.
Do something...
please!
What can we do...
What will help to sell the film?
You don't have anything to sell
the film on.
l have something.
l have...
Will this do?
Genius, Mahi.
Yes, Pallavi?
Mahi...
the tapes have been leaked.
Listen... don't answer any calls.
And, don't react at all.
Hello?
Why are you screaming?
What is it?
Bollywood woke up to a furore as...
Mahi Arora and Aryan Khanna's
tapes were leaked online.
This clip has surfaced one day before...
the release of Mahi's film.
We still don't know if this video is real or morphed.
Bollywood is silent.
We've tried to reach
many eminent personalities...
but no one is willing to comment.
Nearly every one is unreachable.
ls this a tactic against Mahi...
or a cheap publicity stunt?
Mahi Arora's career is down but...
l don't think any girl would
do that to herself.
l am sure someone has morphed the video.
There should be an enquiry.
Mahi is in shock right now...
and she can't give a statement.
The video is doctored.
l request the media...
not to give this video undue attention.
But if people think that Mahi...
has done this to publicize her film...
then l feel they have lost their mind.
Thank you.
This clip has surfaced one day...
before the release of Mahi's film.
ls this a tactic against Mahi...
or a cheap publicity stunt?
Down with Mahi...
Oh shit!
Ma'am, shall l set the table?
No, you can eat.
Okay, ma'am.
Yes, Pallavi?
Mahi... it's a bumper opening.
Both multiplexes and
single screens are rocking.
Really?
We have done it.
l will keep updating you.
Bye.
Based on the crowd behind me...
it is obvious that either Mahi's video...
was a well orchestrated stunt or a fake.
Whatever it was...
it seems to be helping Mahi's film...
pull in the crowd.
The Mahi Arora CD controversy...
seems to have helped her dipping career...
as her latest film, 'Annie'...
shows the silver lining at the box office.
With a record breaking first day collection.
We are Mahi's fans and we will watch 'Annie'.
We love Mahi.
Due to the controversy...
people will watch 'Annie'
Even l will watch it.
What do you have to say about the controversy?
l can't comment on the controversy.
But the film is a super hit in our theatre.
You can't trust movie stars.
They will go to any lengths
to make their film a hit.
Mr. Prahlad Kakkar, what do you
have to say about this controversy?
Who will decide if the CD is real or fake?
There's no point in debating this...
everyone has their personal choices...
then why so much of drama?
After all it's a democratic country...
Rashid bhai, you don't look happy.
You think this is wrong?
How does it matter?
Your film got a bumper opening.
Both multiplexes and single screens
have reported 95% bookings.
As for right and wrong...
who am l to say.
All l know is...
the Mahi l had met ten years ago...
she...
would've asked this question
before anything could happen.
Not after.
Here is your calendar.
you don't need me anymore.
Sir...
Sir...
the media is waiting for you.
You have to say something.
ls Mahi's film a success?
With a scandal like this,
the film had to do well.
That's all l have to say.
Okay, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Tony!
Not right now. She is very tired.
She can't talk right now,
but l will convey your message.
Thank you.
Okay. Bye.
Mr. Vikram...
With the offers pouring in...
Mahi will be busy for the next two years.
Right...
l can only promise you
one film, not two.
But l will surely get her to talk to you
Alright, bye.
See you.
There Mahi...
this is the fact about our industry.
One success and they are all back.
Anyway...
have you thought about what you're
wearing to the success party?
A gown, maybe?
Mahi, this controversy will fade away.
ln a few days, people will forget about it.
You should too.
l'll see you.
Hello, Manish...
The media was trying to locate Mahi...
while she is here at
Shagufta Rizvi's funeral.
lnform them to send the team here
right away!
ln this film industry that
venerates the rising star...
no actor has come to attend the final journey
of beloved actress Shagufta Rizvi.
ldiot, Mahi is inside.
Mahi Arora! Come on.
- Cut!
- Let's run this later.
We fail to see in the glow of glamour...
how much we have lost.
When we realize it, it's often too late.
Hey Mahi.
Mahi, Please tell us...
has bollywood hit their own with you scandle?
What is the hidden story behind it?
ls it true that you leaked the tape?
Your PR company...
Excuse me, aren't you Mahi Arora?
No.
This answer simplified Mahi's complicated life.
For years she looked for happiness
outside the crowd...
and in the end,
she found it by being part of the crowd...
living an ordinary life.

In pre-independence India, Laxman Singh Bisht is a mentally-challenged child, who, although defended by his younger brother Bharat is bullied by his friends, who call him ""Tubelight"". A montage shows them grow up, showing the time when Gandhi visits their school, India's independence in 1947, Gandhi's assassination and the death of their parents, which brings them closer as they grow up.

In October 1962, the Chinese invade India, following which the Indian Army begins to set-up recruitment camps. From their village, only Bharat is selected and allotted the Kumaon Regiment. As they reach their post, war is declared and they come under heavy attack. Laxman anxiously waits for his brother to come back, running from post to post to find out about him.

He meets a magician, Gogo Pasha, who shows him a magic trick by making him move a bottle without touching. Pasha tells Laxman that the secret is 'faith', and that faith can do anything. Oblivious to it, he tries to repeat the trick to his villagers but fails. A village elder, Banne says ""Faith moves a mountain"" and explains how Laxman will find his faith.

Meanwhile, Bharat, while being evacuated after an injury, is ambushed and taken prisoner. He makes a plan with other prisoners to escape.

Laxman observes a woman Le Leing and a boy Gu Won, take a home nearby. Judging them by their appearance, he considers them to be Chinese and tries to report them to the authorities. Banne gets angry, and advises him to follow the wisdom of Gandhi, and befriend the woman and boy. After some attempts, he succeeds in befriending them and learns that are Assamese and not Chinese.

Meanwhile, Bharat's escape plan fails and his fellows are killed. He too is shot and finds himself unable to move. Having no hope of survival, he exchanges his shoes with another soldier who has torn his, to give him a chance to escape. The other guy however gets killed as well.

Laxman learns of his brother's capture and becomes heartbroken, but Leing consoles him and encourages his faith. Laxman's friend, Narayan tries to attack Won, considering him to be Chinese, but is stopped by Laxman. He attempts to convince Laxman to not befriend Chinese people or he will lose Bharat forever; Leing tearfully tells them that they are Indians too. As Laxman tries to explain his belief in 'faith', Narayan challenges him to move a mountain; Laxman apparently succeeds as an earthquake is felt.

With ceasefire declared, the Army begin bringing back corpses. They find a dead body, with Bharat's shoe-tag and declare him dead. Laxman is grief-stricken and believes that people were right about him now that Bharat has been killed. As the friends celebrate the end of the war, Leing's lost father returns. Leing and Gu comforts Laxman as they bid farewell to return to Calcutta.

Laxman, still having a little faith in him, learns of the mistake in identifying corpses due to the interchanged shoes. They receive the news that Bharat is still alive but has lost his memory. At the medical camp, Laxman is reunited with his brother who is able to recognise Laxman, possibly restoring his memory.",3133,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt5882970.srt","See this beautiful place?
It's our town, Jagatpur.
It was a small town then.
I was small, too.
This is me. Laxman Singh Bisht.
This is our headmaster,
Father Frederick.
There's another place, London,
don't know where that is.
He brought this long bulb from there.
It took ages to light up.
(Light up. Light up. Light up!)
The bulb was called a tubelight.
Don't know why, but the kids
also started calling me Tubelight.
Hey Tubelight!
Light up. Light up. Light up!
Laxman, what's three plus four?
The tubelight didn't light up
at once...
...nor did my brain cells.
My mother would say my mind
was like a tubelight.
It needed time to light up...
...but when it did,
it lit up the whole world.
The four brothers:
Ram, Bharat, Shatrughan, Laxman.
They enjoyed life.
But I had no brother.
On the first day of the Ramlila,
I asked God for a boon.
He heard me in a flash.
Lanka was in flames.
Ram and Ravan battled.
Papa emptied a bottle to celebrate
Good triumphing Evil.
It was a cold October night...
...out of pity, mother let him
sleep indoors.
He usually slept outside.
And exactly nine months later
my real story began.
When this little baby
appeared before me...
...he was soft as mountain grass.
My younger brother.
They had already named
me Laxman.
So they worked backwards...
...and named my little brother,
Bharat.
Bharat Singh Bisht.
I had only one friend:
my brother, my partner.
He did whatever I asked.
He trusted me blindly.
I was Tubelight to everyone...
...to my little partner,
I was his Captain.
Tubelight!
Light up. Light up. Light up!
Hey Narayan!
God be praised!
My Bharat got all the kids
standing at attention.
Narayan stood straight as a pole now.
One day a remarkable man came
to our school.
A true captain.
If I believe that I can do
what I set out to do...
...then I'll gain the strength
to complete my task.
Even if I lack that strength
at first.
Even in the terrible cold,
he was dressed sparsely.
I heard this captain bowed
before no British officer.
Namaste, Bapuji.
Bapu, where is true belief?
Belief is inside of you, son.
Right here.
Do not forget that.
Yes, Bapuji.
Where? Where is true belief?
Here. Inside of you.
Since that day, Gandhiji's words
became our catchphrase.
Captain, do you believe
you can do it?
Yes, brother, I believe I can.
Captain, do you believe
you can do it?
Yes, partner. I believe
I can do it.
We believed that together
we could do anything.
But slowly our world
began to change.
India got its independence,
but it was divided into two.
Father Frederick returned
to London with his tubelight.
Father consumed alcohol,
and one day it consumed him.
Alcohol killed my father...
...and grief killed my mother.
And we all killed Gandhiji.
The world turned upside down.
But we brothers could not be parted
You're the ace in the pack.
You're the sixer in my innings.
I'm Aladdin.
You're my genie.
Without you... I'm incomplete.
You're my first paycheck.
You're my true soulmate.
You're Aladdin.
I'm your genie.
Without you...
...I'm incomplete.
You never made me feel
less than the others.
You've taught me how to live.
Dance with abandon.
Leave all your buts and ifs behind.
Jump, Captain! Go on, jump!
No.
Do you believe you can do it?
I totally believe that...
...if I jumped, I will die.
Damn Tubelight, you chicken.
The moron fell!
You bum! Think it's funny?
So jump.
I'm not nuts like you.
When you die...
- ...they won't find your corpse.
- So what?
Your soul will wander about.
You won't know peace.
If my body goes missing,
then burn all my things.
My shoes and clothes.
Throw the ashes into the river.
My soul will be at peace then.
So jump with me.
You're crazy!
We are bound together like
kite and string.
Like kite and string.
Without you, I can't take
a single step.
Not a single step.
You put me on a pedestal.
You taught me how to live.
Play with the clouds like the wind.
Leave all your buts and ifs behind.
Dance with abandon.
Leave all your buts and ifs behind.
Jump high and touch the sky.
Leave all your buts and ifs behind.
All was well.
That's what we thought.
But beyond those mountains
events were taking place...
...that would change
our lives forever.
My Jagatpur friends...
...I am Major Rajbir Tokas.
As you all know...
...there's tension on
the Indo-China border.
So the government has decided...
...that the young men who
wish to serve their country...
...may now enlist in the
Indian army.
I am confident that every man
in Jagatpur...
...is ready to serve his country
at this difficult hour.
Hail to the Motherland!
Glory to the Kumaon Regiment!
How can I leave Laxman alone?
He's not alone. We're here.
- But Banne uncle...
- Listen.
Our Delhi legislator, Mr. Tiwari.
He says there shan't be
a conflict.
There's tension at the border...
...but Pandit Nehru does not
want a conflict with China.
The tension will soon subside.
Come back home then.
Bharat!
Another thing. If you enlisted...
...it'd be good for Laxman.
How?
In three years, you can leave
the army...
...you'll get a pension for life.
You'll have ample money
to look after Laxman.
Besides, how long can you
keep working in my ashram?
I know how little I pay you.
Don't say that, Banne uncle.
When our parents died,
you raised us both.
What happens after I go?
Wise decision.
Everyone's leaving.
Why can't I go?
Captain, try and understand.
How can I?
You're unfit to enlist.
What do you mean?
Unfit?
Do you think I'm a tubelight too?
No, Captain.
You know that isn't true.
So in what way am I unfit?
You're fine, my Captain.
You're just fine.
Catch me, catch me!
Next!
Narayan Lal Tiwari.
You're rejected.
Impossible.
Right! It's impossible.
What do you mean?
Not selected?
You have knock-knees.
Hindi, please.
Come here.
Stand at attention.
Will everyone pay attention?
See how his knees touch
each other?
No gap between his knees.
See how they touch when he
straightens his legs?
It's called knock-knees.
Four Jagatpur boys have
this condition.
When running your knees could
knock against each other...
...and you'd fall.
So don't make me run!
Armed, I can fight
the enemy sitting.
We do not enlist men with
knock-knees. Please go!
I've run without falling.
Wasting time here while
fighting is going on there.
Next!
Laxman Singh Bisht.
Sorry. Rejected.
How come?
See? There's a gap between
my knees.
Let me explain.
Bharat!
Captain! They'll enlist you.
Don't worry.
Will they?
Yes, Captain.
Some men will go to the front,
others will stay here...
...and protect the country.
You're a Captain, Jagatpur
regiment.
Jagatpur regiment?
Yes!
If the enemy enters Jagatpur,
who will alert the army?
You will of course.
A regiment here?
That's right.
Long live India!
Long live India!
Next!
Bharat, be confident!
Bravo! Next.
Next!
Don't worry, son.
Take care.
Laxman, new boots!
They'll get worn out with all
those parades.
Don't worry, brother.
Come back soon.
I'll get you those new boots.
Soldiers! Time to go!
- Hurry up.
- Let's go.
Even if...
...I stole the sparkle from the stars.
Stole the song from the breeze.
They could not ease the pain
of your absence.
Even if...
...I stole the colour from nature.
Stole blessings from the shrine.
They could not ease the pain
of your absence.
This world is full of strangers.
There's only you for me.
You're the dream that came true.
I will wait for your return.
God forbid something happens
to you...
Without you, loneliness stalks
my every step.
I am the moment that time
passed by.
Holi has no colour...
...without you.
Without you...
...the rainy season is dry.
Even if...
...I stole the rulebook of life.
Stole the cream off the profit.
They could not ease the pain
of your absence.
This world is full of strangers.
There's only you for me.
You're the dream that came true.
I will wait for your return.
God forbid something happens
to you...
Sit down! Settle down, folks!
The old, the young and
the little ones.
Some honesty, some trickery.
Everybody loves magic,
from priest to hermit.
I present the greatest King
who ever walked the earth!
Gogo Pasha!
Today I shall perform a miracle,
greater than magic itself.
This is no simple hand trick...
...it's a feat of sheer
willpower.
To perform this miracle...
...I need someone from the audience...
...who is all heart.
Who is that person?
Me! Take me!
You!
Yes, you.
Laxman, he's calling you.
Get up on stage.
You're going to witness a feat
greater than magic.
You'll see something move
that cannot move by itself.
I'm talking about self-belief.
Man's inner strength.
I won't perform this miracle...
...but my new friend will.
His name is...
...Tubelight!
No! They call me Tubelight
to make fun of me.
My name is Laxman.
Laxman, do me a favour.
Your zipper!
Don't worry...
...everyone has a magician
hidden inside.
""Make the impossible possible
Make all your dreams probable
Turn the parrot into a crow
You'll only reap what you sow.""
Now you have the power...
...to perform the miracle!
You will now move this bottle
without touching it.
No, they'll make fun of me.
No, Laxman...
...if you can move it...
...no one will ever make fun
of you again.
Do as I ask.
Concentrate. You can do it.
Just concentrate, Laxman.
Tubelight, light up!
Concentrate, Laxman.
This Tubelight never lights up!
No, Laxman.
Get rid of your fears.
Awaken the power of self-belief.
Laxman, do you believe
you can do it?
Partner, do you believe?
Do you believe you can do it,
Laxman?
I believe I can make
the bottle move.
I can't hear you.
Louder! Do you believe that
you can do it?
Yes. I believe I can make
the bottle move.
Louder! Have you faith?
I can make it move.
Do it through your belief!
Light up. Light up. Light up!
OK, sir! Over!
Soldiers! Take cover
in the mountains.
Sir! Laxman Singh Bisht.
Have you sent the supplies?
Have you increased the quantity?
Cpt. Laxman Singh Bisht.
Sir, when will my brother
return?
- Who?
- My brother Bharat. When, sir?
Are you crazy?
Have you no sense?
There's a conflict raging.
Wasting my time.""When will
my brother return?""
""Following growing tensions...
...China has attacked posts
in Ladakh and NEFA.
We do not know how many Indian
soldiers have been killed.
China has seized control
of seven Indian posts.""
Disaster!
The papers say there are ten
Chinese soldiers to one of ours.
Our forces are unprepared.
They have no guns or ammunition.
How can they fight?
Banne uncle!
Don't say anything that will
upset him.
Banne uncle, you said
there'd be no fighting.
But that's untrue.
- Don't worry, son.
- How can I not worry?
Believe me, it'll be fine.
Believing alone does not help.
It does.
Anything is possible
if your belief is firm.
When Gandhiji began his
non-violent resistance...
...everyone thought it would
not affect the English.
But we all know what finally
happened.
At first others didn't believe it.
But Gandhiji's belief was
so strong...
...that soon every Indian
believed it too.
Their belief shook the
foundations of British rule.
Like the bottle shook?
Like the bottle?
A soda bottle.
I made a bottle move.
Meaning?
Ask Gogo Pasha.
I swear on my mother.
Gogo?
Here's a bottle. Make it move.
You want to see it move?
All right.
- It didn't move.
- Try again.
Let me try from there.
There! The bottle moved.
That's unfair. You moved the bottle.
Because you made me.
That's how belief works.
Gandhiji did not perform magic.
His words were so convincing
that they moved everyone.
People who have self-belief
can move even mountains.
Where do I find belief? So much
that I can move mountains too.
- Not where. But how!
- How?
Follow Gandhiji's teachings.
Do as he did.
What must I do?
I'll tell you about
Gandhiji's teachings tomorrow.
Why tomorrow? Start now!
Go home. It's late.
I'll be back tomorrow.
He's naive, Banne uncle.
What can you teach him?
He's not naive, Maya.
He's just different.
The poor boy is lonely
without Bharat.
We'll keep him distracted
till the war is over.
Chinese!
The Chinese have come.
The Chinese are here.
What do you mean?
- The Chinese are here?
- Where?
There. Over there.
How many are they?
Do they have guns?
- Maybe they do.
- Are they coming here?
Maybe they are.
- Come on, take me to them.
- Let's go.
I'll show them.
Light it!
Careful. They may have guns.
I'll teach them a lesson.
Long live...
That's when I understood why
the army does not enlist...
...people with knock-knees.
Ridiculous!
I told you to follow
in Gandhiji's footsteps...
...and you pull this stunt?
- Not Gandhiji's way?
- God save me.
Absolutely not.
He didn't act foolishly like you
or that idiot Narayan.
So what did Gandhiji do?
Here. Read it.
What does it mean?
Feeling enmity towards others,
is being an enemy to yourself.
That's why you must regard
enemies as friends.
Understood?
Does it mean I must make
friends with the Chinese?
Gandhiji said...
...harbouring hatred will consume
your belief.
But how?
Think about it.
Think about it?
If I befriend the Chinese,
will my belief grow?
Yes!
Gandhiji never hated
the English.
Ok. I'll make friends and bring
my brother home.
Your brother?
My belief will help me bring
Bharat back home. Yes?
If God wills it.
Why would God not wish it?
Or not want it?
You're right.
When my belief is stronger,
I can move mountains, right?
Of course. Why not?
Son, what have you against
your zipper?
Pull it up!
Hey you Chinese kid!
You nuts?
You hit my head and chest.
What next?
I can't make friends with
those crazy people.
Gandhiji's ways are not easy.
Even if Gandhiji came back to life,
he could not befriend them.
Come forward.
You tried to burn their house.
How can they befriend you
so easily?
Think of something.
Want a cold drink? Here.
It's for you.
The Chinese boy smashed
the bottle into little bits.
Lost my 4 annas deposit.
My son!
You have no choice. Make friends.
Namaste.
I am Laxman.
Lax-man.
I am an Indian
and you are Chinese.
Indians-Chinese are brothers.
How to tell this fool?
Who are you calling a fool?
He speaks Hindi!
Now who's the fool?
No, not that. Please!
Put it away.
You hurt me the other day.
I still ache.
Why do you come here
every day?
You speak Hindi too?
Does everyone in China
speak Hindi?
I don't know. I've never been
to China.
We're Indians.
What do you want?
Nothing. I came to make friends.
Watermelon...
...it cools the mind.
I don't want a watermelon.
I want ice-cream.
Ice-cream?
My name is Laxman Singh Bisht.
What's yours?
Han Jian Guo.
Gu?
Gu is not a name.
Gu is potty. Means poo in Hindi!
Not Gu! It's Guo.
Again.
See that shop?
You can buy ice-cream there.
- Not coming with me?
- Don't want ice-cream.
Give me some money.
Go!
Narayan...
One softy, please.
- What does he want?
- A softy.
We don't serve the Chinese.
Get out!
Go, you rascal. Or I'll melt
you with your softy.
Laxman!
He'll get me killed.
Why is the Chinese boy
calling you?
Don't know him, he doesn't
know me. Swear on Banne uncle.
Watch where you're going!
Get down!
Laxman, did you make friends?
I bought him a softy.
We're friends now.
Where's uncle?
He's gone home.
He's off to Delhi tomorrow.
Listen...
He left this list for you.
List? What list?
A list of Gandhiji's teachings.
You must do everything
on the list.
OK!
Your belief will grow
even greater.
Myself Laxman.
Myself Liling.
Sorry.
Maya, look after Laxman.
Stay well.
Are we friends now?
Indians-Chinese, brothers!
How many times must I tell you?
I'm Indian, not Chinese.
Then say: ""Long live Mother India!""
What?
If you're an Indian say:
""Long live Mother India!""
Why?
If you're an Indian, say it.
Or else you're Chinese.
You go first.
Long live Mother India!
Long live Mother India!
I said it louder than you.
So I'm more Indian than you.
Long live Mother India!
Why are we here?
To report to the Major.
Report? Why?
Tell him you're Indian,
not Chinese.
Why?
If an enemy sneaks into Jagatpur,
reporting is my responsibility.
What?
Not even a mouse
would be scared of you.
Wipe your nose.
You have softy all over.
Fix your hair.
Talk politely to the officer.
- And your zipper.
- What?
Pull up your zipper!
- I said four.
- Yes, sir. Four.
- Move, please.
- I asked for four so why only three?
Long live India!
Who is he?
This is Gu.
He's Gu? I see!
Yes, sir. Gu and his mother
are living here.
He's not Chinese, he's an Indian.
He speaks Hindi well, but
trips up on some words.
Want to hear him?
Speak Hindi for him.
Go on.
Say something in Hindi.
Wiping your nose now?
You made a mockery of me.
Why didn't you speak Hindi?
Am I a parrot? You ask, I talk.
I will not speak Hindi.
Have you no shame, Laxman?
You were always a tubelight...
...but are you that dumb?
What's wrong?
The Chinese are killing our
brothers, your brother...
...and you're making friends
with them.
Guo is an Indian.
He can speak Hindi and Chinese.
He's not our enemy.
Shut up! You dumb traitor.
Teaching me who is an enemy
and who is a friend.
Why hit me?
If Bharat was here, he'd give you
a slap too.
No, he'd beat you up.
Drop that rock!
Guo, run!
Watch out! If I see you again
with him...
Now get lost!
Long live Lord Hanuman!
We'll destroy the bunker
with a hand grenade.
How will we throw it?
The bunker is too far away, sir.
Sir, let me.
I will.
Cover his back.
Let's move.
Liling-ji, where is Guo?
Come, I'll explain.
When Guo's papa passed away...
...we lived with my father.
My father, brother and uncle were
thrown in jail in Rajasthan.
My great-grandfather, Lee Tsu,
settled in India.
My parents, my husband and
I were born in India.
But conflict changes everything.
Now people look on us
as enemies.
It makes no difference
that India is our home.
Makes no difference that we
love India as much as you...
...and your brother do.
I brought Guo here from Calcutta
till my father is released.
Guo is safe here.
I heard what happened yesterday.
I don't want Guo mixed up
in all this.
I think it's best for us all
that you stop meeting Guo.
We're not friends?
We're friends, Laxman.
Are we?
Yes.
Guo and I are your friends.
Then my work is done!
My work is done, Liling-ji!
My work is done, Liling-ji!
Thank you!
The boots!
23 rupees, right?
Here's 15.
And the rest in change.
Total 23.
Bharat likes these boots.
They're for him.
- Is Bharat coming home?
- Yes! Very soon.
Really?
We're friends with the Chinese now.
Friends with the Chinese?
When did that happen?
This morning.
I heard nothing on the radio.
Switch the radio on!
The boy seems to know,
yet we know nothing.
Quiet!
The Major has called you.
News about Bharat.
- News about my brother?
- Yes.
News about my brother!
How wonderful, Bharat.
You're going home.
I wish I had been shot.
I'd be heading home too.
Laxman? You?
Where is Banne uncle?
Why are you crying?
Where is Banne uncle?
I told you he was
going to Delhi.
Why today of all days?
Don't cry. You can talk to him.
How?
We have a telephone.
You can call anyone.
How does it work?
With this cable.
It carries your voice there,
and brings his voice here.
- Can we talk to anyone?
- Yes.
- No matter where they are?
- Yes.
I want to call.
Not today. It'll work tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Telephone?
Yes, telephone.
Please call, sir.
- Call where?
- China.
Who do you want to call
in China?
An officer like you, sir.
Let's call him.
Why?
To get news of Bharat.
We'll talk to my brother.
Be quiet!
Look, Laxman...
This is our phone,
the number here is 3867.
Assume his number is 5678,
so you dial...
You dial like this.
5...6...7...8
The bell rings there.
Someone picks up the phone,
we talk.
But we do not have a number
there to call.
Who will have it, sir?
Maybe... The Chinese may have it.
I'll be right back.
Liling-ji, do you have a number
for China?
- What?
- A number for China?
Your great-grandpa's number
in China. Leechi...
Lee Tsu.
Yes!
- How many brothers did he have?
- Three.
- Did they all come to India?
- No.
Why?
You must have some family
back in China?
Laxman, we don't have any family
there.
You must have someone.
Grandpa? Grandma? Uncle?
Laxman, what's all this nonsense?
Liling-ji, I must get a number
in China.
What's happened, Laxman?
They took him away.
The Chinese have taken him.
They've got Bharat.
Have faith, Laxman.
Your brother will come home.
How can he?
The Chinese have taken him away.
When the fighting is over, all the
prisoners will be freed.
And if they kill him?
They won't.
How do you know?
People can kill each other.
Laxman, don't give up.
You must believe that your
brother will return.
Don't let fear fester in your heart.
There's some words like that
in Gandhiji's list.
Banne uncle's list.
""Fear is our enemy.""
It means...
...you must rid your heart
of your fears.
What do you fear most in life?
Partner, do you believe?
Yes, partner. I believe.
Partner, do you have self-belief?
How can you walk in those boots?
Walk? We had better run
for our lives.
Or else we'll all be dead.
Don't be crazy.
They'll shoot if we try anything.
He's right.
We must run...
...if we want to survive.
What's the next one?
This is short and sweet.
""Truth is my god.""
Do you understand?
This is really simple.
""Speak the truth.""
For how long?
Always.
""Always"" is a long time.
It goes on and on...
...till the very end.
Don't have that much time.
So tell the truth to those
to whom you have lied.
Smart! My work will be done sooner.
Let's go.
Teacher...
Go on!
Panditji...
Go on!
Aunty...
Go on.
Sir, remember when you
punished me outside...
...all day long?
Remember when I was a kid...
...you asked me to offer milk
to Lord Shiva on Shivrati?
Aunty, remember the night
of the flood...
...you sent me looking
for your husband?
I said I couldn't find him.
I was angry and poured water
into your bag. Remember?
Never mind, son. It happens.
I told you Lord Shiva drank
the milk before my very eyes.
- Remember.
- Yes, I remember!
Lord Shiva drank the milk...
...performing a great miracle.
I remember. The next day the
poor man came home exhausted.
That wasn't water, sir.
It wasn't water?
- What was it?
- It was...
It was pee, sir.
Panditji, that was not
the Lord's miracle.
A small boy drank the milk.
That boy was...
...me.
I did find him.
You damn Tubelight!
Your husband gave me a jalebi.
A jalebi? Why?
Because he was feeding
jalebis to Nattu's aunt.
So?
He wasn't using his hands,
but his lips...like this.
Run, Guo.
Laxman, stop!
Run, Guo.
You sinner!
""Truth is my god.""
They must have news of Bharat.
- Let's ask the Major.
- OK.
Bharat is not among them.
Go home.
And hurry! Get your friend
out of here.
There is too much tension.
Now go.
""Increased fighting is expected
in the Aksai Chin zone.
According to our reports...
...over 200 Indian soldiers
have died.
The enemy offensive has damaged
the morale of our soldiers.""
Oh no.
Did you know that Ghuman Singh's
two sons were killed?
Oh Lord Shiva.
This loser never learns.
My blood boils when I see
them.
Must you stay glued to him?
What's he to you?
He's my friend.
Get back!
You traitor. The Chinese
cannot be our friends.
Our brothers are dying
and you two...
I'll show him.
I won't spare either of you.
No!
No! Run, Guo, run.
I won't spare him.
You and your son had better
leave tomorrow.
Only Indians live in Jagatpur.
Who are you to decide who
is Indian and who is not?
We have as much right as you
to live here.
We're Indians because we believe
it in our hearts.
We don't need a certificate
from anyone to prove it.
Liling-ji is right.
Shut up!
If you befriend enemies,
your brother will never return.
Sure he will. I'll bring him back.
You'll bring him back?
Hear that?
Tubelight of all people!
This number one moron
will bring his brother back.
I will bring him back.
Wait and see.
And how will you do it?
If one has belief,
anything is possible.
Shut up! You and your ""belief!""
You moved one silly bottle,
now you lecture on belief.
What's a bottle? You can
even move mountains.
Move mountains, eh?
Your zipper is never zipped up.
And you'll move mountains.
A mountain, my foot!
There it is. Try!
Show everyone. Come on.
Make it move!
If you can move it an inch,
I'll shave off my moustache.
You don't have to do it.
He just wants to make
a fool of you.
Shut up! You've said enough.
- Stop!
- Maya, don't butt in.
- Enough!
- Make him see sense.
Why are you making a scene?
One minute...
That was no earthquake.
A great power moved
the mountain.
What power?
The papers say it
was an earthquake.
People need excuses
to believe in miracles.
OK. Let's assume it was
an earthquake...
...but how did it happen?
I don't know.
It was a miracle. I saw it
with my own eyes.
So build a temple in his name!
It was a miracle.
Children, you should
believe in science.
It was just an earthquake.
Laxman just happened
to be there.
Teacher, I saw Laxman
with my own eyes.
He moved the mountain like this.
Sit down!
For 35 years,
I've seen this mountain every day.
I swear it.
It seems to have shifted
to the right.
Am I wrong?
A little to its right... do you see it?
Goodness me!
Have you read this?
Yes. I heard there was
an earthquake.
No, not an earthquake.
It was Laxman, he moved
the mountain.
Get lost!
Don't even mention holidays.
Hey Laxman. Sit down.
I'll make you a drink.
No, sir. Alcohol consumed
my father.
A true miracle!
They say you moved
the mountain...
...by doing something
like this. Right?
Sir, my belief has really grown.
So find a way to stop this
cruel fighting, my Captain...
...so all our men come home.
And the Chinese soldiers can
go home to their children, too.
Sir, if the fighting stops...
...will all the soldiers
return home?
Yes, Captain.
And so will your brother.
We're here.
China is to the east.
Where is east, Liling-ji?
Where the sun rises.
That's where China is.
Why do you ask?
I must stop the fighting, Liling-ji.
Major Tokas said Bharat will not
return till it ends.
You'll stop the fighting?
You mean like this?
Yes, Liling-ji.
Look Laxman, you did not
move that mountain.
And you did not cause
that earthquake.
But Liling-ji, you saw it
with your own eyes.
Yes, Laxman. But no one can
move a mountain.
To move mountains is just
a saying.
Self-belief is a very
precious thing.
But it cannot perform miracles.
And if something happens that you
did not wish for...
...then do not think that
your belief did not work.
We must believe, Laxman.
Believe that Bharat will return.
I must believe that my father
will return too.
We must believe this cruel
war will end some day.
""Despite the bravery of
the Indian soldiers...
...they were forced to retreat
from Walong.
Heavy shelling at Chushul
was reported late last night.
264 Indian soldiers have
lost their lives.
The Chinese are bombing our
posts from every direction.""
It's getting from bad to worse.
It's impossible to even bring
their bodies back.
The fallen soldiers turn to ice
on the spot, frozen...
...with their rifles.
O Lord Shiva!
My broken heart...
...burns in your flame.
Wherever you may be...
...you live in my heart.
My broken heart...
...flows in your waves.
Wherever you may be...
...you live in my heart.
You may live in this world
or in the next.
You are everywhere.
This is my only belief.
You are everywhere.
Forever and ever...
...in every way you are
my only belief.
Each time I remember you...
...I gasp for breath.
I cry out in despair.
I pray to catch a glimpse of you.
Broken bits of my heart...
...stay in wait for you.
Wherever you may be...
...you live in my heart.
Whenever I feel sad...
...you make me smile again.
Wherever you may be...
...you live in my heart.
What's he doing?
Is he stirring up another
earthquake?
Hold on tight to the railings.
You may live in this world...
...or in the next.
You are everywhere.
This is my only belief.
You are everywhere.
Forever and ever...
...in every way you are
my only belief.
Laxman is back.
Laxman is here!
You've done it.
You've done it. Done it!
Look! Today's headlines.
The conflict has ended.
There is a LOC between
China and India.
You've done it.
Yes, son! You've done it.
You've shown us all.
Laxman has done what
he said he would.
I have done it!
I had the best news ever.
It made me leap to the sky.
My wishes were granted.
My prayers had that power.
Spruced myself up,
combed my hair.
Got my shoes polished.
Now I'm ready to dance.
My dear, play the Radio.
Play your music loud for me.
My dear, play the Radio.
Make them all wanna dance
with me.
He was that lost bit
of my heart...
...I knew that I'd find it
again.
I knew it in my heart.
I'd happily sacrifice my life
so he'd head home.
Sacrifice is OK by me.
Like an upright officer...
...sitting in a jeep, my soldier
will come home again.
My dear, play the Radio.
Play your music loud for me.
Listen.
Listen to me!
Wait a minute.
There's no news about
our men returning.
But the fighting is over.
I understand your plight.
The fight has ended.
But our units deep in the
mountains are out of reach.
We cannot contact them,
even by radio.
You should do your job.
Hear me out!
We hear there's still fighting
in some areas.
It hasn't stopped everywhere.
- Why did we spare the Chinese?
- Meaning?
Parading before our very eyes...
...while their soldiers
kill our brothers.
Brothers, calm down.
I will not spare them.
What's wrong, Guo?
Why are you crying?
Stop shouting! You nutcase.
Why hit him?
Who was hit?
He's talking rubbish.
I saw him with my own eyes.
You beat him up.
Who was beaten?
- What's Laxman talking about?
- Nothing.
He beat Liling-ji's father.
He's always been crazy.
Talking rubbish.
Liar! Narayan hit her father.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Shut up! Want another slap?
- Why did you hit him?
- He's an enemy.
No, they are not enemies.
Will someone stop him?
He's gone mad. Stop him!
No pulse, no breath...
...emptiness is all I see.
In a life without you...
...emptiness is all I see.
No tears, no sighs...
...emptiness is all I see.
Now even death is inviting.
Emptiness is all I see.
Why have I survived?
What am I without you?
In every hour, in every place.
Emptiness is all I see.
Your shadow no longer
follows me.
Emptiness is all I see.
In a life without you...
...emptiness is all I see.
The valleys look forlorn.
The empty paths send their greetings.
Lost in thoughts of you.
Stories of you
return to my lips.
Lost in thoughts of you.
Why have I survived?
What am I without you?
In every hour, in every place.
Emptiness is all I see.
Your shadow no longer
follows me.
Emptiness is all I see.
In a life without you...
...emptiness is all I see.
Two ice-cream, please.
Here.
My treat.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Can we sit with you?
We're going back to Calcutta.
Father must be admitted
to the hospital.
Is Guo leaving too?
They were right to say...
...I was a tubelight.
Lived by a list.
I thought I could bring
my brother back.
Tubelight!
That list was the love
you have for your brother.
You said your brother
always asked you:
""Partner, do you believe
in yourself?""
You proved that you believed.
You did whatever you could
for your brother.
If he knew what you've done,
he'd be proud of you.
The softy is melting.
Need some help?
Yes.
The boots...
Take my boots.
Record their names and unit numbers
from their tags.
He's dead, sir.
Which unit did he belong to?
Bharat Singh Bisht.
3rd Kumaon.
Sir, he's breathing.
He's alive.
Take him to the camp below.
- On the double!
- Yes, sir.
I'm going. I'm going to
bring my brother home.
I'll bring him back.
Listen, brother.
Sir! Don't forget your boots.
Knock-knees!
The priest said that God
would return Bharat to me.
Banne uncle said it was my
belief that protected Bharat.
Liling-ji said it was my love.
There's Bharat.
He's badly wounded.
He's suffering from trauma.
You must be patient.
My partner.
Brother.
I am your Captain.
Partner, the boots?
You wanted these boots?
Partner! See who has come.
Banne uncle.
This is Liling and Gu.
Not Gu. It's Guo!
The only thing that I have
understood...
...is that belief is powerful.
It takes time to light up...
...but when it does, it
brightens the whole world.
Just like a tubelight.",31515

Insia Malik, a 15-year-old girl, lives with her Muslim family in Baroda: her mother Najma, her brother Guddu, her paternal grandmother, and her abusive father Farookh, who often beats his wife. Insia is very passionate about singing, and her mother supports her, but her father is against her dream of being a singer.

She records a song wearing a niqab, so Farookh can't find out her identity, and uploads the video on YouTube under the name of 'Secret Superstar' using the laptop gifted by Najma. She becomes an overnight sensation and grabs the attention of Shakti Kumar, a talented but pretentious music director based in Mumbai. He requests Insia to record a song, but she refuses as she hears a lot of negative things about him. Due to her poor academic grades, Farookh rips out all the strings from her guitar.

The next night, after discovering that Najma sold a valuable necklace to buy Insia's laptop, Farookh thrashes her and tells Insia to throw out the laptop. Insia gets so angry that she snatches the laptop and drops it from the balcony where it falls and shatters on the street. After fleeing from school to record a song for Kumar, she is unable to sing a certain party song. Insia tells this to Kumar who reveals that it is a remix. He tells her about the original version which was launched ten years ago. After singing the original song, her fame grows and she is nominated for the Best Female Singer. Insia persuades Kumar to arrange a meeting with his ex-wife's lawyer. The lawyer prepares divorce papers for Najma to sign, and gives them to Insia.

Insia gives her mother divorce papers to sign, but her mother angrily rejects Insia's demand that her parents divorce. Insia becomes frustrated with her mother, but later forgives her, after her grandmother reveals how Najma struggled to keep Insia alive. Farookh is offered a job in Riyadh and he makes it known to Insia that he plans to marry her off to his friend's son. Devastated, Insia gives up her dream of singing and deletes her YouTube channel. Farookh confirms their departure on the last day of Insia's exams.

Their first flight goes well. However, during a layover at Mumbai airport, Farookh spots Insia's guitar case. Unwilling to pay the extra fee for the case, he demands that Insia throw the guitar in the nearest trash can. After initially holding back her emotions, Najma finally stands up for herself and boldly protests. She angrily warns Farookh that should he lay hands on her or her kids, he will face severe consequences and even lose his job in Riyadh. Najma then unpacks the divorce papers, signs them, and thrusts them into Farookh's hands. Najma says her goodbyes to Farookh's mother (Insia and Guddu's grandmother) and storms out of the airport with her kids in tow leaving Farookh as he tries to beg Najma and Insia for forgiveness. Najma borrows a stranger's cell phone and asks Insia to contact Kumar. All three ultimately end up at the awards ceremony where Insia has been nominated for Best Female Singer. Unfortunately, Insia does not win the award. But the winner, Monali Thakur, graciously offers Insia her award believing she rightfully deserved it. Kumar stands up and calls attention to Insia's presence in the audience. Once onstage, Insia reveals her true identity and dedicates her award to her mother and proclaims her the true 'Secret Superstar' since Najma supported and fought for Insia even before her birth.

The screen fades to a message dedicating the movie ""To Mothers And Motherhood."" Later, Shakti kumar releases a cheesy party song on YouTube dedicated to Insia.",3598,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt6108090.srt","Grow up.

Insia...
Is this a new song?
It's really nice. You wrote it?
What are you doing here?
I have an announcement to make.
These are the flyers of an inter-school
cultural competition.
In every category,
the winner gets a laptop
and one year of free internet!
Let me see!
And one more thing, all the best everyone.
Did you have fun, dear?
How was your trip?
I missed you so much.
Let me carry the bag.
You know, on the show Singing Idol,
a little boy auditioned.
Shakti Kumaarr was so hard on him...
it was terrible!
What happened to your eyes?
It's nothing.
I opened the kitchen cabinet,
and the door hit my eye.
You're right.
I'm really stupid.
So, I was saying,
Shakti Kumaarr was so mean
that the poor kid broke down.
I am right.
You really are stupid.
Insu!
Get away!
- Hello!
Hello.
- How was your outing?
Be quiet.
- Did you get me any gifts?
What gifts?
Two chocolates?
No.
- One chocolate?
Shut up.
- Not even one?
No!
- Insia!
Don't you have manners?
You didn't even greet me.
Greetings, Grand-aunt.
Greetings.
Why didn't you get me a gift?
- Get out of here!
Gift... gift. Go!
Why are you screaming at Guddu?
- Guddu...
Up to no good, this mother and daughter!
This one. No, this one.
So, judges, what's your verdict?
Ten points just for cuteness.
Are we judging cuteness?
This is a singing show, Monali. Singing.
I know my job. I'm a judge, too.
You are useless.
He can't sing to save his life.
Kiddo, you're an insult to talent!
You're an insult to talent!
What do you know about talent?
What are you looking at?
Now, get out!
<i>Friends, Mr. Shakti is well knownfor his anger.</i>
<i>And now it is rumoredthat his wife left him last month.</i>
<i>Obviously he's under stress</i>
<i>And frustrated.</i>
<i>Well, his marriage seems to be over,</i>
<i>after the break
our astrologer will predict,</i>
<i>whether Salman will finallyget married this year.</i>
Oh, I completely forgot,
Glamour Awards is on TV tonight.
I remembered.
Who do you think will win Best Singer?
I don't know. It's a tough one.
Best Music Composer?
Anyone... but Shakti Kumaarr.
He has never won an award in any case.
Earlier, he made such good songs.
But nowadays, when I listen to his songs,
it feels like he has remixed
some really nice song,
and that nice song never got made.
Mom...
Potty.
Wait for sometime.
Come.
<i>Let's proceed to the next award,</i>
<i>which isthe 'Best Female Playback Singer'.</i>
<i>And the nominees for this award are:</i>
<i>Monali Thakur...</i>
Sudha Venkat will definitely win.
No, Monali Thakur.
Bet?
- Bet!
Done.
- If I win, I can ask for anything.
Okay.
Mom, I'm done.
He's done.
I am coming.
Push some more. There maybe some left.
<i>Shakti Kummarr!</i>
<i>I'm tired of receiving awards.</i>
<i>I'm tired.</i>
He'll blabber on now.
<i>So, this time I called
Glamour Awards and said, </i>
<i>""Glamour Award, this year Shakti
won't receive the award, he'll give it.""</i>
Mom!
- Yes?
I'm done.
<i>So, here I am to give the award
for the Best Singer...</i>
<i>female.</i>
<i>To my protÃ©gÃ©, whom I launched.</i>
<i>Monali Thakur. </i>
<i>Come, Mona. Come, babes.</i>
Keep loving me this way
and I'll keep singing such lovely songs.
Thank you so much.
Babes, you're singing
quite well these days.
<i>But, you've been only screaming
at little children nowadays.</i>
<i>Why don't you write some songs?</i>
<i>Who are you to tell me what to do?</i>
<i>I've won the award, haven't I?</i>
<i>I think I've earned the right to speak.</i>
<i>Why are you giving a speech?</i>
<i>Have you won an award?</i>
<i>You used to sing jingles
for toothpaste ads,</i>
<i>I groomed you.</i>
They are arguing on television.
They have no shame.
By the way, I won the bet.
Yes.
So, what do you want?
There's an inter-school
singing competition.
Can I participate?
Okay. But, don't tell your father.
But, if I get selected for the finals
I will have to go to Mumbai.
No, Insu.
Then let it go.
Your father threatens to break
your guitar every now and then!
He'll never allow it.
You said I could ask for anything.
Insu, I said you can ask anything from me.
Not from life.
Listen, I have an idea.
What?
- Come here.
Stop being so gloomy.
Tell me.
Your father will be home late.
- So?
He'll be tired and hungry.
Ask him this question, when he's eating.
He may agree.
Good idea, Mom.
Which song should I sing?
Song...
- Do you know what the first prize is?
A laptop and a year of free internet.
So, think of a good song.
Sing any song.
You'll win for sure.
You're my favorite singer.
Even better than Monali Thakur.
Really.
Go to sleep.
Salam, father.
Can I expect to get some water
in this house?
Yes, Father.
How was your trip?
It was good, Father.
Did you learn anything
or did you just waste your time?
No, Father. It was good.
How are you?
Salam.
Father, there's this...
Father, there is a...
There's less salt.
What?
Come here.
Just coming.
Should I fill my stomach
with your apology?
Can a man not expect a decent meal
after working 17 hours?
Father...
Najma... Have you packed my bag?
- Yes?
Bag?
Are you Najma?
- I'm sorry, Father.
You are leaving day after, right?
What did I say? When was I leaving?
On the third.
What's the date today?
Today is the second.
What does that make tomorrow?
I'm sorry.
- You forget the salt. You forget to pack.
Is there anything you remember?
I'm fed up of you.
Say sorry once more,,
and it won't be the plate, it'll be you.
You go inside, I'll clean it.
Mom, I think you should leave father.
He's not the right husband for you.
Then who is?
Shah Rukh Khan?
Mom, why don't you get it?
I'm not joking.
Insu, I've told you a million times.
Who will take care of us?
There's your school fees...
We can't be depen on your grandfather.
Why grandfather?
Mom, trust me. I'll take care of us.
Really?
What's your plan?
Just trust me, Mom.
Tell me, isn't the destination
decided first and then the route later?
Did the chicken come first or the egg?
What?
Did the chicken come first or the egg?
It depends on the situation.
Meaning?
Meaning, if you want to eat chicken,
the egg comes first,
it hatches into a chicken, which you cook.
But, if you want to have an omelet,
the chicken comes first,
it lays the egg,
which you make into an omelet.
Oh God, Insu! You have
the answer to every question.
No, Mom.
But, we'll find it, won't we?
Insu, it's impossible to argue with you.
- Then, don't.
Promise me.
What?
If I make a good plan,
you will leave Father.
Insu...
Don't Insu me. Promise me.
Mom, promise me.
Okay... fine...
Go to sleep now. I promise.
-Like a definite promise?
-All right, I promise.
A real promise?
Yes!
Bye.
Come on... quick.
What about our journey?
I am afraid.
Insia.
Insia!
Give me one example of irony.
Did this witch have to ask me
a question right now?
I have just got a tune, If I think
about the answer I'll forget it.
Are you deaf?
Give me one example of irony.
Should I answer or stay with the tune?
Give me our hand.
I said, give me your hand!
Go on, hit me.
You are most welcome.
Guddu, open the door.
How long do you take to open the door?
Sorry... sorry.
Give it to me!
What's this?!
Mom, what's this?!
What?
I have no idea.
Where did it come from, Guddu?
Drama queen!
Mom, how much did it cost?
Thousand rupees per kilo.
Your laptop is more expensive
than mangoes.
Tell me. Where did you get the money from?
It doesn't matter.
Last night if I had added
salt in the food,
then perhaps you would've won this
in the competition.
But, I forgot.
Tell me honestly.
Did you borrow the money?
I can't accept it. Let's return it.
Are you crazy, Insu?
There are so many things in life,
I have not been able to give you,
and nor will I be able to.
Don't rob me of the joy
of seeing you smile.
It comes rarely.
Mom!
Yes?
Look, the world is so big,
and our Baroda is so small.
Is this Baroda?!
<i>Suddenly my eyes have learnt to dance</i>
<i>Suddenly my teeth have learnt to sparkle</i>

<i>Suddenly every little thing
Is bringing me joy</i>
Who is this?
- No idea, Mom!
Really?
<i>Suddenly every little thing
Is bringing me joy</i>
Why are you still awake at this hour?
Mom, I want to upload
my videos on YouTube.
How wonderful.
Upload your videos on YouTube,
and send it to your father in Riyadh.
You know what will happen next.
I know, Mom.
Insu, it's 3 am.
Stop dreaming and go to sleep.
How is that possible, Mom?
First you tell me to sleep,
then you ask me not to dream?
When I sleep won't I end up dreaming?
You tell me, why do we
wake up every morning?
So that we can realize our dreams.
Otherwise, what's the point
of waking up every day?
Mom, there is no point
to anything without dreams.
Neither to sleep, nor to wake up.
Neither to live, nor to die.
Mom, to dream is a basic right!
Everyone should be allowed this much.
- Insu, how much you talk!
Tell me in one line, what do you want?
Tell me, what is your dream?
What do I want?
Mom, I want the whole world
to hear my voice.
Not just school, or Baroda, or India.
The whole world should know me
as the best singer.
Not just you.
That's my dream, too.
And I'm sure it will come true.
Go to sleep now.
Let it be, Mom.
It's useless talking to you.
Insu.
I have an idea.
What?
What are you doing?
Wait.
Here.
What's this?
An idea.
It's not an idea, it's a burqa.
Exactly!
What do you mean?
I should wear this and make videos?
- Yes.
You want the entire world
to hear you, right?
Why do they have to see your face?
They should hear you.
It does matter, Mom. How absurd?
It's a horrible idea.
I want to be famous
and you tell me to hide my face?
No. You don't understand.
Listen to me.
I'm not telling you
to change your destination.
Just change your route.
You should allow that much.
No, Mom. It's a stupid idea.
It will never work.
To all those who are watching me,
this is my first YouTube video.

I can't tell you all my name.

I knew it was a stupid idea.
Your mother put me in a fix.
I already have so many children.
I shouldn't have taken you in.
Everyone knows that I don't take
more than 45 children.
I'm sorry, ma'am. It won't happen again.
Come, now.
Find a place.
Yes, ma'am.
- It's 1173K.
And 1973K.
Ma'am, there's no other place to sit.
What is it?
You came late to class.
So, if you want notes,
I can share them with you.
Okay.
Hey, Insia.
I added you on Facebook.
You didn't respond.
Are we friends?
- Are we not?
Chintan.
Tell me.
Do you have the trigonometry sums solved?
Yes, I do.
You can copy them.
I'll wait outside your house.
Are you a watchman?
No.
You can come inside.
Okay.
Insu.
Lay the table.
Mom!
Mom.
Mom.
Insu. Easy.
- Come here.
Calm down.
Look, Mom.
This is your video!
Yes, and guess how many people
have watched it?
11,470 people!
Seriously?
- Yes.
I have never even met
so many people in my life.
All thanks to this laptop.
Your idea worked, Mom.
I told you, didn't I?
Now I'll be a superstar, too!
Insu, listen...
everyone knows a superstar.
You'll have to remain a secret.
Or your father will throw us
out of the house along with this laptop.
Try to understand.
- Don't worry, Mom.
Insu.
I mean it.
Your father shouldn't get to know.
How will Father know?
Father doesn't watch YouTube.
Promise. Nothing will happen.
Alright.
Before your grand-aunt yells,
I'll serve dinner.
Listen. Come here.
What is it now, Mom?
- Your father will be back tomorrow.
He's going to be home all day.
Please keep this thing shut.
Mom, when will Father
get that job in Riyadh?
Once he does, he will be
out of our lives for 11 months, right?
Yes, and during Ramadan,
he'll be in the house 24 hours.
Only one month, right? We'll bear with it.
It's not a bad deal.
Hey, what's your name?
You are so talented.
Your videos are damn good.
Do you have a Twitter account
or a Facebook page?
So sad!
You can't show your face?
How does it matter
if she shows her face or not?
What an amazing voice this child has!
Otherwise, videos nowadays are short
on both talent and clothes.
You have such an amazing voice.
When do we get to see your next video?
Thank you.
You are not sleepy either?
It's 3 am.
I'm in New York.
It's 5.30 in the evening here.
Mom.
Mom.
Mom, people in New York
are watching my video, too.
Mom.
Salam.
All well?
Yes.
How's Guddu?
He's fine.
What's this?
Where did it come from?
Brother sent it.
No one was using it at his house.
Has your brother ever sent anything new?
He likes dumping his trash here.
Aunt.
Shah Rukh Khan's film is showing.
Do you want to watch it?
- Since your uncle passed away,
I haven't gone to the theater.
Shall we go, then?
- That's a great idea.
Insu, too, has been wanting
to watch a film.
Doesn't Insia have assignments to do?
Aren't the 10th grade exams important?
Films, television, guitar...
Stop everything this year.
And now this laptop...
What use is it?
Come here.
It is very difficult to find a match
for an illiterate, uneducated girl.
I got stuck. Not everyone will.
I'm sorry.
Be careful, Aunt.

Chintan.
Does ma'am yell at you?
Yes.
She yells at me more.
Hey!
Ma'am, I'm done.
So fast?
- Yes.
Show it to me.
Wait a minute, Insia.
What's this?
Teacher, I'll come prepared tomorrow
and take the test again.
Get your mom to sign this.
Your mom pleaded with me
to take you in this class.
Taking you in was a waste of my time.
It wasn't the pleading,
it was double the fees that worked on you!
Oh, really?
Your father is the one
paying me 'double fees'.
My fees come from his hard earned money.
So, get his signature too.
I'm so sorry, ma'am. I didn't mean...
Go, get the signatures.
I'm sorry, ma'am. Please...
Go or I will call your home.
Get the signatures.
Ma'am, I'm done too.
Insia, what happened?
I'm sorry.
Hey, this is you, isn't it?
What? What rubbish?
And what are you doing here?
I've seen all your videos.
I had a feeling it's you.
Because I recognize your voice.
Everyone at school watches your videos.
Who else knows?
I don't think anyone else knows. Only me.
Hey, just a minute!
You don't want anyone to know,
that's why you wear a burqa, right?
Insu?
Chintan, please take this newspaper
and leave.
And don't tell anyone about this, please.
Okay. Don't worry.
I keep everyone's secrets.
I never reveal anyone's secrets.
Thanks, Chintan.
By the way,
can I tell you one of my secrets?
Sure.
Well...
What?
- Not because you are a superstar.
I swear to God!
I've loved you way before that.
You must have felt it too?
Leave. I have to go home.
Should I go?
Go.
Najma.
- Yes?
Have you taken the newspaper?
The newspaper hasn't come today.
<i>Welcome back, guys.</i>
<i>Bollywood's news...</i>
Be sure to deduct his money.
Today's not a holiday.
Sure.
<i>- Secret Superstar. </i>
<i>- Anonymous, yet famous. </i>
<i>- Who is this mysterious girl
who won't show us her face?</i>
<i>- Is this a marketing strategy? </i>
<i>- If not, then who is this person,</i>
<i>who has taken the Internet by storm
in barely four months? </i>
<i>- Friends... you must've heard...</i>
Father, look at this dinosaur...
I'm sorry, Father.
Why are you always in a hurry, Guddu?
<i>- Coco Money Singh's song
has got one million views.</i>
<i>But our Secret Superstar
has got thirty million views!</i>
<i>Not just that,</i>
<i>her song 'Who Am I?' is trending
on number one on YouTube.</i>
<i>- And Superstar Amitabh Bachchan himself
has tweeted about this song.</i>
<i>This afternoon the All India committee
of the Singers' Association,</i>
<i>has boycotted music composer
Mr. Shakti Kumaarr.</i>
<i>The committee is deeply upset
with the way he yelled at a small child,</i>
<i>on the Singing Idol show.</i>
<i>The situation is such</i>
<i>that no singer is ready to singfor Shakti Kumaarr's new film.</i>
<i>- Now, the producer will have no choice
but to replace him. </i>
By the way,
it's Zahir's daughter's wedding tomorrow.
You have to come, too.
And there's no need to wear a burqa there.
They are very modern. They won't like it.
Guddu, you come with us too.
Hi, ma'am
I'm in love with you.
I haven't seen your face,
but I love your voice.
Bye!
Babes, I saw your video.
Hiding your face, eh?
Naughty... naughty!
You have a pretty good voice.
Not bad. You have potential.
If you want to make your future,
then call Shakti.
Yuck!
- My number is 98200...
Couldn't A.R. Rahman have emailed instead?
Go on, talk to him.
What happened?
Father, we had a science test.
The same? 50 percent again?
No, Father, this was just a test
at the private tuition.
I will study harder for the school exams.
How much did you score?
-Thirty.
-Out of?
Hundred.
You failed?
Yes, Father.
But this was a surprise test.
I was totally unprepared.
Had I known earlier,
I would've gone prepared.
I need your signature on this.
Father, look how strictly
she has assessed it.
Get me your guitar.
What?
Father, I'm sorry.
I'll study well for the school exams.
I will score 70 percent.
70 percent? You can't even pass!
I said, bring me your guitar.
I'm sorry, Father.
Don't make me ask you again.
Don't restring it till I tell you to.
How is this connected to my exams?
Even if I don't play, I could still fail!
Insu! Is this how you talk to your father?
Apologize to him. Listen.
- What did you say?
I'm sorry.
She's just a child. Let her go.
Are you doing me a favor by apologizing?
I'm sorry.
- Let her go.
Insu.
Why are you irritating me, Chintan?
Go away.
I'm sorry. Take care.
Say 'Who's there'.
I have a great 'knock, knock' joke.
Why are you bugging me, Chintan?
""Hi, Insia!""
""I see you're in a bad mood.""
""I'm a lollipop.""
""Why don't you eat me?""
Are you a pet dog?
Why do you always follow me?
Why are you so obsessed with me?
What's your problem?
I've told you off
four times since morning.
But you don't understand.
Because you have no self-respect.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm extremely sorry.
You're looking like a star.
Come on... hurry up.
How much longer?
I'm coming. Just a minute longer.
Insu, eat your food.
And serve grand-aunt, too.
We'll be late.
Shall we go?
- Yes.
Will you come like this?
What's wrong?
Something's missing.
Wear that gold necklace
your father gave you, the cheap one.
Otherwise, people will think
that this engineer husband
can't even buy his wife a necklace.
I don't know where I've kept it.
If I start looking for it now,
it'll get very late.
Let's go.
- It's not like we live in a palace!
It's a small house.
Look for it. I'll wait.
I remember now.
It's in the bank locker.
Have you taken sleeping pills?
We gave up the locker four months ago.
Don't waste time. Go... find it.
Actually, I forgot to tell you.
I left it at my brother's house.
You had worn it on Eid.
We haven't met your brother after that.
Don't bullshit me!
Go inside.
I said, find it. That's it!
Nonsense!
- Come, I'll help you find it.
I'll wait here.
Mom, you sold the necklace
to buy the laptop?
What else could I do?
There was nothing else to sell.
Why did you sell the gold necklace?
What should we tell Father now?
I don't know, Insu.
What should we do?
I'll say that I've kept it somewhere.
I can't find it.
Will Father believe you?
I don't know, Insu.
I don't know what to say.
I'll have to say something.
There's no other way out.
I'll say I've misplaced it.
Let's try that.
I'm looking for it. I'll find it.
Insu, look there in that box.
I must've kept it there.
Look in that box below.
Can't find it.
Sell the house next without asking me.
Father, listen...
- Did I speak to you?
Father, but...
- Did I speak to you?
I was going to tell you.
Father... listen...
Father, I had insisted... Listen, Father.
Stand here.
Father, listen to me.
I'll definitely sell the laptop tomorrow.
And we will buy a similar necklace.
Father, it's my fault, not hers.
Insia, take Guddu and go inside.
I'm telling you the truth.
Mom had nothing to do with this.
Didn't you hear me?
Take Guddu and go inside.
Father, it's not her fault.
I'm responsible for this.
Do you want your brother to see this?
Do you?
You should definitely be seeing this
because it's all your fault.
She really had nothing to do with this.
Father...
Insu.
Take Guddu inside.
Go. Go inside.
- Tell me, what else you have sold.
- Don't tell me later, you sold this
and that and forgot to tell me.
- What are you looking down for?
- Look at me. I'm asking you something.
- Yes? I'm asking you.
- Answer me.
- Tell me.
- Who am I? Am I a dog?
- Am I your servant?
- Put a leash around my neck
and tie me outside.
- Is this what I'm worth?
- Who do you think I am?
- Will you say something?
- Or have you gone mute? Mistake? How?
- How? Did it happen on its own?
- You must've planned it.
- So you didn't plan it?
- Was it involuntary?
- Tell me.
Father, stop it, please.
I don't want the laptop. You can sell it.
I'm admitting that it's my fault.
Right. The laptop.
Where is it?
Najma. Go and get the laptop.
Laptop.
Hurry up.
Throw it out.
Why are you looking at her?
Oh, right! It's your laptop.
And you are the one who wanted it.
So, you should throw it out.
Today, let's turn to page number 22
of our Gujarati textbooks.
We shall recite this beautiful poem called
<i>Mane Joine Udi Jata Pakshi.</i>
Which means,
the birds who fly at my sight.
You are angry, right? Because you
insulted me in front of everyone?
You are the one who should be angry.
I'm sorry.
Actually, that was my trick.
Yes, I do the same thing with my mom.
When she's in a bad mood,
I try to cheer her up.
Instead, she yells at me.
And when she does that,
she releases her anger.
Then she's back to normal.
So, I thought I should use
the same trick on you.
No problem. It's okay.
Flatbread?
It's the best flatbread in the universe.
Then I'll have to eat it.
You both are friends now, right?
You read his tweet?
I read all your tweets.
And the ones by your fans, too.
That music composer, Shakti Kumaarr,
has also sent you a tweet.
Call him.
You can be a playback singer in his film.
I won't call him.
Why?
- He's not a nice man.
Do you know him?
No!
Then how do you know
that he's not a nice person?
I've seen it on the news.
And his wife left him, too.
So, he must not be a nice man.
My mom left my dad, too.
But he is not a bad man.
My mom told me.
I'm sorry, Chintan... I didn't know.
It's not your fault.
Mom tells me, it's nobody's fault.
Will you do me a favor?
Sure, tell me.
My laptop broke.
Will you check my email?
And post on Facebook and Twitter
that I won't be uploading videos
for some time.
Due to some personal problem.
And, do you want to say anything
to Shakti Kumaarr?
Insia, what's your password?
Give me a pen.
Go... sit!
Chintan.
Chintan!
- Yes?
Your stop.
Oh... I see.
I'll get off at the next stop.
Next stop... for sure.
What's your mom like?
Mom is like a child.
What do you mean?
You know how children are cute
but so naive.
Always scared.
And very stupid.
You have to always explain
what's right for them, and what's not.
Yet they never get it.
Mom is exactly like that.
Absolutely stupid.
How do you know?
Know what?
About children.
Do you have any?
I'm sorry. I'm just joking.
There are two boys.
This one beats the other.
And he falls into the water...
Salam, Father.
Salam.
How are you, child?
I'm fine. Guddu, open your mouth.
What are we celebrating?
Aunt, I've got that job in Riyadh.
In one of the Sheikh's oil rigs.
As a senior engineer.
Very good.
Did you hear?
- Yes.
Here, have some.
That's such good news.
I'll make a thanks-giving prayer
tomorrow at the mausoleum.
Why not?
And tonight, we'll all eat out.
You come too.
Okay, Father.
Here, take it.
You've grown up so much.
In these last few months,
enjoy your freedom.
Then you'll have to start a new life
in a new country.
Right?
Did you know, Zahir's friend lives there?
He's the vice president
of the company I'll be working for.
He has a son.
Razzaq.
He has a travel agency.
He also has a license for Hajj tours.
He's a good boy. You will like him.
Look. He has also sent some photographs.
You knew all along, didn't you?
That if Father got this job, we'll all
have to move with him to Saudi Arabia.
I didn't think he'd get the job, Insu.
Forget it, Mom.
I don't want to talk to you.
At least listen to me...
- Mom, please.
Insu.
Everything will be okay.
What will be okay?
How?
Mom, I'm telling you let's run away.
Where will we go, Insu?
How does it matter?
Anyway, in this house,
no one cares about us.
He just cares about Guddu, doesn't he?
We'll leave Guddu behind.
What rubbish, Insu!
If we leave Guddu here,
he will grow up to be
exactly like his father.
So what's the point of our lives?
That we make Guddu
two percent better than him?
What about our lives?
Insu.
Some things are beyond our control.
Wrong, Mom. Wrong!
Everything is in our control.
There's nothing that we can't do.
I'm telling you, Mom.
I'm not going to Saudi Arabia.
I'll run away.
And you shouldn't go either.
Mom, I'll plan something.
Insu...
- Insu... Insu... Insu!
It's useless talking to you.
<i>Shakti Kumaarr's lifehas taken a new twist.</i>
<i>The Mumbai Family Court
has ruled against him.</i>
<i>And his wife has won the case.</i>
<i>His wife's lawyer, Sheena Sabavala,
has proved in the court,</i>
<i>that he has not one,
not two, but three affairs!</i>
<i>And that too, simultaneously!</i>
<i>Here's what Shakti Kumaarr had to say.</i>
<i>Sir, you lost the case. How do you feel?</i>
<i>Bullshit. It's all rubbish.</i>
<i>My wife's lawyer, Sheena Sabavala,has lied in court.</i>
<i>I will appeal to the Supreme court.</i>
<i>But are the rumors
about your affairs true?</i>
<i>Shut up, you...
- Sir, please, sir.</i>
<i>Now, let's meet the enemy
of such men, Sheena Sabavala.</i>
<i>Ma'am, tell us aboutShakti Kumaarr's case.</i>
<i>Shakti Kumaarr is an ill-mannered
and disgusting man. </i>
<i>I'm very happy with the court's decision.</i>
<i>It's important to teach a lesson
to men like Shakti.</i>
<i>If I'm not mistaken</i>
<i>this is Advocate Sheena Sabavala's11th victory this year.</i>
<i>Which means, she has ruined the lives
of 11 men in this one year alone.</i>
<i>Sheena Sabavala has a perfect
track record in family court.</i>
<i>Whether she's up against
a music composer or a mafia don,</i>
<i>So, all the menwho are watching this show...</i>
Chintan.
Come.
I have some work. You carry on.
Okay.
I've saved it. It's in 'contacts'.
But... there's a problem.
What's the problem?
I recharge the phone with my allowance.
There's no money left
on the phone, and I'm broke.
So, I can't call?
No. You can give him a missed call.
- A missed call?
Why will he call me back?
He will. Give it a try.
How do you know he will call back?
I have my fingers crossed!
Try once more, please.
I'm sorry. Tomorrow I'll take an advance
on my allowance.
It's okay. Forget it.
Chintan, go home.
Don't irritate me. I want to be alone.
I'm headed to your building.
My friend stays there.
Which friend?
Jignesh.
There's no Jignesh in my building.
Oh, sorry.
I thought every building in Baroda
would have at least one Jignesh.
Chintan, please don't try
your tricks on me again.
Go home.
- I'm sorry.
Insia... Insu...
He called back. Come quickly!
Hello. Mr. Shakti?
Insia Mallik...
My videos are on the internet
by the name of Secret Superstar.
Yes sir, the girl in the burqa.
Sorry, it's my friend's phone.
There's no calling balance on his phone.
So...
Sir, Baroda.
Today?
Not today, sir.
Tomorrow?
Yes, sir. Tomorrow.
But sir, I have one condition.
If the recording goes well,
then you have to help me.
That I'll tell you tomorrow.
Promise, sir?
A real promise?
Thank you, sir.
Sir, can I... can you call me back
in two minutes, please?
Thank you, sir.
He wants me to go to Mumbai
tomorrow, to record a song.
Chintan, how will I go?
By aeroplane.
Yes, I know.
He said he'll book the flight
and send an airport pickup.
You'll have to skip school tomorrow.
I'll give you the class notes.
And anyway, you don't do your assignments.
By the time school finishes,
you come back.
What if someone sees me?
You are the 'Secret Superstar'. 'Secret!'
There's one more problem.
I've never flown before.
- I'll make a plan by tomorrow.
Insu, wait...
- Mom, I'm getting late.
Bye, Insu.
- Wait for two minutes.
Hang on.
At least take your lunch box.
- Your mom drops you off at the bus stop.
So, you have to get on it.
- Don't worry about the ticket.
- Here's your ticket.
- I'll get its printout.
Come on, Insu. Hurry up!
- The bus drops us off
inside the school gate.
- So, you'll have to make
your escape from school.
- As soon as you reach school,
go to the girls toilet.
- And, jump out from there.
Oh, no!
- I know an escape route.
- I figured in case of a terrorist attack,
I must have an escape plan.
Chintan, there's a lock on this!
- Lock?
Now what?
I'll think of something.
I'll be late for the flight.
It won't break!
What are you doing?
Wait.
You'll have to jump the wall.
Have you lost it?
Do you have a better idea?
How will I get back inside?
I have eight hours to figure that out.
I'll think of something.
Come on, give me your bag.
Put one foot here.
And one foot there.
Yes.
Land on your feet
or else you will hurt yourself.
Are you okay?
Yes, and you?
I'm fine.
Listen...
Yes?
The airport, please.
Please drive faster.
- At the airport,
show your school ID and ticket.
Stop!
- If questioned,
say that your grandfather is unwell.
Are you traveling alone?
My grandfather is unwell.
Okay.
- At the airline counter,
ask for a window seat.
Mister, that's my seat.
It's a short flight.
Sit anywhere you want.
But the window seat is mine.
How does it matter?
I'm already sitting here. You sit there.
Mister, that's my seat. Get up!
- Don't forget to fasten your seat belt.
- When the plane takes off, you'll see...
- how big the world is
and how small Baroda is.
- Your bad mood, your father,
Ms. Sheetal...
- leaving everyone behind,
you will fly away.
- I'll wave to you from down here,
but you won't be able to see me.
Do you need an auto-rickshaw?
A taxi?
A hotel?
Where do you want to go?
Secret Superstar?
No.
I'm the airport pickup.
I'm Ranjeet.
Come.
Has Shakti Kumaarr sent you?
Yes, ma'am. Shakti Kumaarr has sent me.
Now, shall we? Or else we'll be late.
Come on.
Unions don't operate on relationships,
but money.
Give as much as you want.
I'll call you back.
What a voice!
My pleasure to meet you, kiddo.
What an interesting journey!
Baroda, Burqa, YouTube,
Shakti Kumaarr and then...
Superstar!
I'll host a launch event for you.
At a five-star hotel. Big time!
Industry, media, trade.
I'll buy the front page
of Mumbai Times for you.
Babes, don't mind,
but your name is low on glamour.
What does it mean? Your name? Insia?
It means 'woman'.
Oh! Woman...
Woman.
It sounds awful and it's meaning is worse.
What about Shabnam?
Too old fashioned.
Sunny?
- That name has been taken.
Natashha!
Natashha with a double H.
N-A-T-A-S-S-H-A. Natashha.
Sir.
I'm sorry but my identity
needs to remain a secret.
If my dad finds out, I'll be dead meat.
Look, sooner or later
the media will find out.
Whether I tell them or not.
Anyway, we are short on time.
The shoot for the song is in two days.
The album releases in two weeks.
And the film, in two months.
And you have to get back
to school in six hours.
Ali, play the song.
<i>I'll speak your words</i>
<i>I'll sing your praises</i>
<i>I'll adorn myselfWith the colors of your love</i>
<i>Oh, I dance wild and free</i>
<i>For you, my sexy lover!</i>
<i>My sexy lover!</i>
<i>My sexy lover!</i>
It's a superhit, kiddo.
Everything is by the grace of God.
On the mic, kiddo.
Ranjeet, take her to the mic.
- Okay.
Come on.
Ali, is everything ready?
- Yes, sir.
Okay, well done.
It's definitely a hit, kiddo. A superhit!
Just sing it.
Come on, go for it.
Sir, I need two minutes.
Let's start. Ready. Come on.
Go for it, kiddo.
Not like this, kiddo.
Don't you get it?
Do one thing. Start from the verse.
We'll patch the moaning later.
- Yes, sir.
<i>I'll speak your words</i>
<i>I'll sing your praises</i>
<i>I'll adorn myself with...</i>
This is not a hymn, kiddo.
Sing it with feeling.
Get the feeling of the song.
<i>I'll speak your words</i>
<i>I'll sing your praises</i>
You are making a mistake.
You are singing from your head.
Do you know where
you should be singing from?
Heart, sir. From the heart.
Doomed!
She wants to sing from the heart.
You don't have to sing
from your heart, kiddo.
You have to sing with your body.
Meaning?
- Body language.
Body language.
Okay?
You know what, you need
to loosen up. Open up a little.
Try jogging.
Jogging?
- Yes.
Where?
- Right there. Spot jogging.
Come on, I'll show you.
Yes, go for it. Knees up.
Yes, well done. Very good.
Come on. Very good, kiddo.
Buck up, India... buck up, India.
<i>I'll praise your words
I'll word your song</i>
Come on. Go for it.
<i>I'll...</i>
<i>I'll sing your praises</i>
<i>I'll adorn myself</i>
Listen, you won't be able to do it.
Ranjeet will drop you off to the airport.
There's a huge difference
between singing at home,
and singing in front of the mic.
It's not everyone's cup of tea.
You... go back to school.
Sir, I need to use the toilet.
- You know Insu, earlier,
he made such good songs.
- But nowadays,
when I listen to his songs,
- it feels like he has remixed
some really nice song,
- and that nice song never got made.
I told you, she's not good enough.
But you didn't listen.
As it is, no one wants to work with you.
Why are you trying to destroy my film?
I'll find someone.
- Who are you going to find?
Should I sing it by myself?
Please leave this film. Spare me.
- Sir.
Sir, can you step out
for a minute, please?
What is it?
I want to talk to you in private.
What's up? What's the problem?
Sir, I feel the problem is not with me,
it's with your song.
I see.
You mean there's no problem with you.
The problem is with my song.
Wow... wow! Amazing! I like it!
That's a new one. Amazing!
Sir, I'm not a professional singer.
- I can see that.
Sir, actually I'm a listener.
Ever since I was born...
my mom made me listen
to Bollywood songs... new, old, all!
So?
What am I supposed to do?
I've no interest in your nonsense.
But you should be interested
in my nonsense!
I read in the news,
that the Singers' Association
has boycotted you.
Who are they to boycott me?
I boycott them. Scram! Boycott!
Sir, let me finish.
Your song is a romantic song,
but the tune is upbeat.
The lyrics are good,
but you've ruined them with innuendos.
It feels like a remixed version
of a great song, which never got made!
My mom says that, too.
This song should be one
from the heart...
- 2007.
What?
I made this song ten years ago in 2007.
This is the remix version.
The producer kept asking for a party song.
I spun it around.
This isn't the original.
<i>Your words and thoughtsWill flow from me</i>
<i>In your praise and devotionWill I always sing</i>
<i>In robes weaved of your love
I'll dress myself</i>
<i>And merge into your colors</i>
<i>With ornaments bejeweled with your love
I'll decorate myself</i>
<i>And merge into your radiance</i>
<i>I dance wild and free</i>
<i>Adorned in you, my love!</i>
Sir, this is what I will sing.
Exactly this way.
Nowadays, everyone wants a fast song.
Sir, that's not true.
Have you heard the songs of Aashiqui 2?
There are no fast songs in the album.
Yet it was a super hit.
So sir, let me try it once.
I'll sing it just the way you did.
The producer won't agree.
Sir, let me try once.
Not with 'body language',
but from the heart.
Just once. For my sake?
I see.
For your sake?
Sir, it's a lovely song.
But can I remove the word 'sexy', please?
Shakti had added that word.
Remove it.
Ali, cancel this session.
Load the one from 2007. The old one.
I'm trying a new version. Check it out.
Sir, the slow version?
Why? Do you have a problem?
<i>Your words and thoughts
Will flow from me</i>
<i>In your praise and devotion
Will I always sing</i>
<i>In robes weaved of your love
I'll dress myself</i>
<i>And merge into your colors</i>
<i>With ornaments bejeweled with your love
I'll decorate myself</i>
<i>And merge into your radiance</i>
<i>I dance wild and free
Adorned in you, my love</i>
<i>I dance wild and free
Resonating with you, my love</i>
<i>I've lost my bearings
The world taunts</i>
<i>I'm beyond consciousness, beyond reason
I've lost myself, they say</i>
<i>I've lost my identity to you
They scorn me</i>
<i>But what do they know
The mysteries of this heart?</i>
<i>By losing myself</i>
<i>And realizing you</i>
<i>I've found myself, I'm complete
I'm one with myself.</i>
<i>I'll abandon all ties
And come to you</i>
<i>All evil aimed at you
Let it befall me</i>
<i>In robes weaved of your love
I'll dress myself</i>

<i>With ornaments bejeweled with your love
I'll decorate myself</i>

<i>I dance wild and free
Adorned in you, my love</i>
<i>I dance wild and free
Resonating with you, my love</i>
Wow!
You have no idea
how I'm feeling right now.
I feel as though
this was the first recording of my life.
You won't understand.
Sir, actually this really was
the first recording of my life.
<i>With ornaments bejeweled with your love
I'll decorate myself</i>
Sir, I want to discuss something with you.
Yes, tell me. What is it?
Sir, I want your help.
Your fees, yes. Sorry.
Your friend's name is... Yes, Chintan.
Should I send him your check?
- No, sir. I don't want money.
I just need your help.
Kiddo, once this song releases,
you won't need anyone's help.
Producers and music composers
will line up outside your house.
Sir, aren't you divorced?
What do you mean?
Your wife left you.
She's taken your kids, too.
Yes, so?
I want to meet your wife's lawyer.
I want to get my parents divorced.
What? Why?
I'm sorry. I can understand.
Don't worry. I'll help you.
I'll call my lawyer right away.
Kamlesh is a fantastic lawyer.
No, sir. Not your lawyer.
But your wife's lawyer.
Who? Sheena Sabavala?
She's crazy.
Sir, you promised.
Yes, and I'm not refusing you.
I'm helping you.
Hi, Kamlesh.
- Your 'fantastic' lawyer lost your case.
Kamlesh... listen... I'll...
I'll call you back.
What do you mean by 'Who?'
Don't pretend you don't know. Hello!
I know you're busy. I'm not free either.
I haven't called for small talk.
I have important work. Need to meet.
We'll talk when we meet.
No, this isn't about my divorce.
It's another matter.
It's about a girl...
Age? What's your age?
- I'm 15.
She's 15 years old.
How can you even think like that?
You've gone crazy. You're mad!
I will take you to the Supreme Court.
I tried. You saw me.
You saw what happened.
Hello, Sheena.
Listen to me.
I'm an ill-mannered person. You're right.
Listen to me, babes! I'm begging you.
Not for me. It's for this little girl.
This innocent child.
Please.
She just needs half an hour. That's all.
Can we come now?
Next month?
No, babes, that's too late.
Next week? It's an emergency.
Next week?
Next week, good.
Witch!
So, see you next week.
I'll send your ticket to your boyfriend.
What's his name? Yes, Chintan.
Sir, he's not my boyfriend.
- What?
He's not your boyfriend?
Then why are you blushing?
Chintan!
Mom, the materials I need
for my project are missing.
Insu. We bought it just a few days ago.
Where can it disappear?
Did you leave it in school?
Mom, how will I complete
my school project now?
Guddu, get ready for bed.
Guddu...
Have you seen my glue bottle?
And my brown tape?
No?
Do you want me to slap you?
Mom, tell him not to touch my stuff.
Guddu, how many times have I told you
not to touch her things?
I was making a gift for Insu.
There's no need to make me a gift.
Airport, please.
Come, kiddo.
Babe, tell Sheena that Shakti is here.
She's busy.
Please wait.
- Oh. Busy?
""Please wait.""
Come, kiddo.
Oh my... I'm heart broken.
No, thanks.
I'm better off ""thirsty"".
You go.
Ma'am.
My dad...
he beats my mother...
for every little thing.
Once, Mom forgot to turn on
the water heater.
He fractured her bone.
Babes, have you heard my new song?
Which one, 'Soft and Tender'?
No, that's old now.
The new song is...
'Rough and Ready'.
Look, Insia. This is a difficult case.
Firstly, Guddu and you are minors.
Furthermore, your mom's
financial situation isn't strong.
Anyway, I will prepare a file for you.
Take it home.
Read it to your mom
and tell her what's written in it.
Explain it to her. Okay?
And then get her to sign on it.
Alright, ma'am.
The lines on your palm tells me
that there's a new love in your life.
Here.
Ma'am, I can't afford your fees...
Don't worry. She's a very cheap lawyer.
I'll handle it. Come.
Listen.
No, dear. I was talking to him.
Perhaps you are not as bad as you seem.
Sir, may I ask you something?
Why are you helping me?
Kiddo, actually...
Our stories are very similar.
How's that?
You know, in the past ten years,
I've been divorced twice.
My brother sued me.
I pretty much have no family.
This film industry is my family.
It's my mom, sister., family..
And, this film industry too,
has never given me an ounce of love.
They nominate me every year,
but have never given me an award.
How does this make our stories similar?
Anyways...
how did you learn to play the guitar?
I was six years old.
My mom got me a guitar.
Sir, I want to relocate to Mumbai.
With my mom.
I want proper training in music.
Then, maybe I can be
a part of Singing Idol, too.
Kids like you don't need Singing Idol.
Then how will I become a superstar?
You will become one anyway.
Talented kids like you are...
How do I explain?
You are like bubbles in soda.
You see these bubbles?
It's rising one by one, right?
So?
Talented kids are like that.
They rise like this. On their own.
Nothing can stop them.
No problem, kiddo.
Just call me
if you have any problems, okay?
Tell Chintan to give me a missed call
once you've reached home safely.
Take care, kiddo.
Mom, get down, I want to talk to you.
Not now, Insu.
Hurry up and start chopping
the vegetables.
Mom, get down.
Not now. Later...
- Mom, it's very important. Get down.
Goodness.
What is it?
Sit.
Mom, I... I had gone to Mumbai.
Shakti Kumaarr, the composer,
had sent me an email.
He called me to Mumbai to record a song.
The recording went very well.
After that Mr. Shakti got me
to meet a lawyer.
She's a famous lawyer in Mumbai.
She has given me these divorce papers.
Please take a look at them.
Mom, please leave Dad.
Then we won't have to go to Saudi Arabia.
I'll become a famous singer.
And Mr. Shakti said that he would help.
You went to Mumbai?
When?
Last week. And today.
Mom, the plan is ready.
In a plane?
Alone?
And school?
Mom, I was going to tell you, but...
- Have you grown up so much,
that you'll go to Mumbai alone?
You'll get your parents divorced?
But Mom, I told you that I had a plan.
What were you thinking?
If something had happened to you,
how would I know?
You met a lawyer, too!
What were you thinking?
You thought,
you'll get your parents divorced?
Did you ask me
whether I want a divorce or not?
And what is this nonsense about divorce?
What has your dad done?
Don't you know what he has done?
He beats you up all the time.
He has a bad temper.
-He doesn't have control. Which man...
-Please, Mom!
What sort of a life are we living?
We aren't even allowed to breathe.
Now, he will take us to Saudi.
Marry me off to someone like him.
Without even asking me.
-I'll suffer the same fate as you.
-Insu.
Everyone has their limitations.
- But I don't, Mom.
Mom, trust me. I'll make everything okay.
What will you do?
My father didn't ask me
before getting me married.
My daughter didn't ask me
if I want a divorce.
No one cares about what I want.
Whatever, Mom!
I won't go to Saudi.
- That's it, Insu.
This is my world.
And this is your world, too!
And in our reality, I've given you
as much freedom as I could.
But, don't dream of flying beyond this.
Don't!
We are going to Saudi with your dad.
I won't let your education stop,
I promise.
But my dream of becoming a singer
will never come true.
Don't argue with me.
We are going to Saudi with your dad.
I won't go to Saudi.
I can't believe how you can be so stupid.
Doesn't it make any difference to you?
My life will be wasted, Mom.
You are such a coward that
you can't do anything for your daughter!
The gift?
It isn't ready yet.
Give it to me. It's not done yet.
Insia.
Now apologize to your mom.
I won't apologize to mom.
It's her fault. Not mine.
Her biggest mistake
is that she gave birth to you.
Your dad had said,
""What will you do with a girl?""
""Abort her.""
Najma was adamant.
Everyone beat her up.
They dragged her to the doctor.
Then?
The doctor said, ""It's late today.""
""We will operate on her tomorrow.""
They kept her in the hospital all night.
Didn't you say anything?
I constantly wonder
why my mother didn't abort me?
What good has my life been?
And mom? The operation?
The next day,
when we went to the hospital,
your mom had escaped.
Ten months later,
when she returned with you,
she said, ""Next time if it's a girl,
we could abort.""
""Let's keep her.""
""This is my Insia.""
Where was I born?
And where was Mom?
How does it matter?
After all, it's your mom's fault,
not yours. Right?
Why should you apologize?
Listen.
Najma never wanted you to know all this.
Don't tell her you know.
Do you understand?
But...
The joy I'm having in telling you this
is nothing compared to the joy
your mom gets in keeping this from you.

You don't need to waste your life.
Sir, my mom didn't give up on me.

Why are you wasting your talent?

<i>Secret Superstar!</i>
<i>Friends, a few months ago, </i>
<i>a mystery girl wearing a burqa,</i>
<i>uploaded her songs
on her YouTube channel. </i>
<i>These videos became so popular
that even celebrities and politicians</i>
<i>appreciated and shared them.</i>
<i>But a few weeks ago,
this YouTube channel went dormant.</i>
<i>No more songs!</i>
<i>There was silence on her
YouTube, Facebook, Twitter pages. </i>
<i>'Come Back Secret Superstar' pages

<i>Because our Secret Superstar
has set foot into the world of Bollywood.</i>
<i>Let's talk to Shakti Kumaarr about her.</i>
<i>- Sir, tell us something
about the Secret Superstar.</i>
<i>There's a pain in her voice
that stems from her heart.</i>
<i>Her eyes have a passion
that transcends into her voice. </i>
<i>She's blessed by Jesus.
She's a gifted child... gifted!</i>
<i>What's her real name?</i>
How does it matter?
Her voice is real!

Insu...
Mom, I don't want to dream any more.
Isn't school over?
No, Dad.
Today is the last day.
When are your exams starting?
From the fifth of the next month.
And when do they end?
On the 20th.
Alright, I'll book the tickets for 20th.
Start packing.
Don't leave anything for the last minute.
Okay?
I'll write it.
You wrote even the last time.
It's my turn now.
-My turn.
-No.
Shall I write something?
Are your tickets booked?
Insu.
Shall we go?
Ma'am, just a minute.
I'm Chintan.
Insia's friend.
The 'pav bhaji' that you sent
for lunch the other day was amazing.
I didn't let Insia have it.
I finished everything.
Will you have ice cream?
No.
Ma'am, today is the last day of school.
So, if you don't mind,
can Insia and I go for ice cream?
We'll be back in ten minutes.
Promise. Please?
Please?
Go.
- Thank you, ma'am. Let's go.
Go.
- Come.
Go!
- Come on.
Listen.
Your dad has gone to Ahmedabad.
He'll return late at night.
You can stay out longer,
but come back by evening.
Come.
Babes, your song has become a superhit.
Yes, sir. I've seen it.
It's always shown on TV.
And Mom has bought its CD.
- There's more good news.
What?
- Glamour Awards has nominated you.
Best Singer.
What? Really?
And me, too.
- Wow, sir.
I can't believe it.
When is it?
On the 20th. In Mumbai.
You should come.
No, sir. I won't be able to come.
You know that.
But you will surely win the award.
Fat chance.
No, sir. Don't say that.
I'm sure, you will win it this time.
Listen.
Don't forget me when you go to Saudi.
Keep in touch.
How can I forget you?
You have done so much for me.
God bless, kiddo.
Don't be sad.
You are anyway the best singer.
And you, a best friend.
Let's celebrate today.
What?
I read on twitter...
""Don't cry it's over, smile it happened.""
You read this on Twitter?
- Yes.
Who tweeted it?

How did your exam go?
Good.
I'm going to Mumbai.
To attend the Glamour Awards.
Mr. Shakti has arranged a pass for me.
<i>I love you</i>
<i>I love you</i>
Sir, load this too.
Careful.
I need to use the toilet.
Hold this.
Watch the luggage.
I...
Ma'am, my husband has gone to the toilet.
He'll be back in two minutes.
No problem. Please step out of the queue.
No... please check these.
Mom, don't worry. I'll take care of it.
From here to Mumbai,
then Mumbai to Riyadh.
You'll get the boarding passes to Riyadh
at the Mumbai International airport.
You'll have to check in your bags
again at Mumbai airport.
I have another request.
These three seats together.
And these two seats behind them.
Okay, ma'am.
Done?
Come on, then.
It happens every time.
Someone takes my window seat.
That's my seat.
Come, take the window seat.
<i>Monali Thakur, Sudha Venkat, Geet Singhal,
have been joined this time, </i>
<i>by our first-time nominee,
Secret Superstar.</i>
<i>For her beautiful song...</i>
Secret Superstar sings really well.
- Yes.
She'll definitely win the award.
Yes, she should win the award.
Where are the rest of the passengers?
Hello!
- Yes.
Why don't you dive into the television?
Come on.
Guddu, move to the side.
Stand here or you'll get hurt.
Sir, this needs a fragile tag.
- Okay.
On these two as well.
- I'll do it. Don't worry.
Sir, you have extra baggage.
You'll have to pay for it.
What rubbish!
Every bag is under 25kg.
I weighed them myself.
Sir, it is not about the weight.
You have an extra bag.
You are allowed to check in ten bags,
but you've checked in eleven bags.
How much will I have to pay?
Sir, 4,500 rupees.
What's this?
Where has this come from?
Tell me.
- It's Insu's guitar.
So? Are we taking her there
to play the guitar?
When will you both stop obsessing
over the guitar?
Insia.
Pick up the guitar.
Yes... and dump it in the dustbin.
Over there.
There is no need for a guitar there.
Do you think I'll pay 5,000 rupees
for that junk?
Listen...
Insu has nothing but her guitar.
There's so much luggage anyway,
so let's take her guitar too.
It's not a guitar, it's junk.
The same junk that's in both your heads.
It's not junk.
It's Insu's guitar.
If you say the word 'guitar' once more,
you have no idea,
how hard I'll slap you right here.
Get it?
In fact, it's not even a guitar.
It's Insia's dream.
And without dreams
there's no point to anything.
Neither to sleep, nor to wake up.
Neither to live, nor to die.
To dream is a basic right.
Everyone should be allowed this much.
- Hey!
Have you lost it?
I've told you once that
the guitar will stay here. That's it!
Alright.
The guitar will stay here.
Along with Insu,
Guddu,
and me.
We are not coming to Riyadh with you.
Hold it!
There are cameras everywhere.
If you hit me,
we'll take the footage from security
and upload it on YouTube.
Insu has a channel on it.
Haven't you seen it on TV?
The burqa clad girl.
The one who sings and plays the guitar.
She has millions of fans.
They'll all see you.
Before any of this happens,
it's best that you go to Riyadh.
Enough is enough! Stop this nonsense.
I'm your husband.
You can't move from here
without my permission.
Hold this, Insu.
What's happening? Can't you hear me?
Can't you hear or have you gone deaf?
Why are you opening this bag?
What's this?
What file is this?
Can't you hear me?
I'm talking to you. Look here.
What are you doing?
What file is this?
What are you signing on?
What are you signing on?
What's this?
I can't read.
You can.
It's written here
that if I complain to the police,
you'll be arrested.
You'll definitely lose the children.
I might get your house, too.
If you get arrested,
you'll lose your job in Riyadh.
And your life will be ruined.
Why take the risk?
It's best you go from here
and leave us alone.
Come on, Insu.
- Sir, are you checking in?
- Shall I give your boarding passes?
- You are blocking the queue.
Are you going to board the flight?
Excuse me, sir. I'm talking to you.
I can hear you!
I'm not deaf!
Najma!
Where are you going? Listen to me.
The passports and luggage are lying there.
Insia, explain to your mom.
It's all about the guitar, right?
We'll take the guitar along.
Listen, I'm ready to take the guitar.
Ma'am, once you step out,
you won't be allowed back in.
Nothing could be better than that.
Najma!
Listen to me!
But Mom...
What will we do now?
Where will we go?
Ma'am, may I use your cell phone
to make a call?
It's urgent, please. Just one call.
Thank you so much.
Insu.
Call Shakti Kumaarr.
It's the night of the awards, right?
Let's just go there for now.
We'll figure the rest later.
When will they be here?
Any minute.
How are you?
Insia's mom, I'm very happy to meet you.
Fantastic!
Shakti's entry.
Hold it.
Where are your passes?
Don't you recognize her?
No.
Wait.
She's the YouTube singer.
- If you are done with your nonsense,
can we do some important work?
- Yes, of course. Let's get on
with what we've been paid for.
Monali Thakur.
What rubbish!
It's all rubbish.
Ever since I was a little girl
and used to sing on stage,
I had just one dream.
To win these awards.
And every time I'm in the audience
and the nominations were announced,
I always wish that I win, not anyone else.
But, this time...
something didn't feel right.
Today,
amongst us,
there's a new star.
And compared to her voice,
my voice seems to pale.
Secret Superstar...
If you're here amongst us today,
please come up,
and collect your award.
Because I...
I can't accept this award.
Go on.
Go. They're calling you.
Insu, go.
Secret Superstar, are you here?
Is Secret Superstar there?
Secret Superstar...
Are you here?
The Secret Superstar is here.
Put a spotlight on her.
Give her a big hand.
Move the jib! Cameras on her!
Insu, go.
- Insu, go.
You should go.
- They're calling you. Go.
Go.
Claim your window seat.
You all think
that I'm the 'Secret Superstar'.
But I'm not.
I was six years old
when mom got me a guitar.
How?
She stole money from my dad's wallet.
She had a necklace.
Her last ornament.
She sold that and bought me a laptop.
Dad wanted to end my story
when I was in my mom's womb.
But she didn't let it happen.
My mom has written my story.
And she continues to write it.
Singing songs and winning awards,
have always been my dream.
But some people aren't allowed to dream.
The freedom to dream...
Well, my mom gave me that, too.
So, who's the superstar here?
Me?
Or my mom?
Mom...
You are not stupid.
You're a genius.
You are not a coward.
You're a fighter.
You aren't childish at all, Mom.
You are the world's best mom.
<i>She's my dearestMy mom</i>
<i>She's my dearestMy mom</i>
<i>She's my dearestMy mom</i>

Friends, this is Shakti Kumaarr's
first YouTube video.
And I dedicate it to the Secret Superstar,
whom I launched!
So, presenting my new song,
fresh off the block,
recorded just yesterday.
<i>I'll speak your words</i>
<i>I'll sing your praises</i>
<i>I'll adorn myself
With the colors of your love</i>
<i>I'll dance like you</i>
<i>I'll sway like you</i>
<i>I'll adorn myself
With the jewels of your love</i>
<i>I dance wild and free</i>
<i>I dance wild and free
For you, my sexy lover</i>
<i>Oh, my sexy lover</i>
<i>Oh, my sexy lover</i>
<i>Oh, my sexy lover</i>
<i>Go for it!</i>
<i>Let's go</i>
<i>Everybody in the house</i>
<i>Very hot, whiskey shot
Got me high without a sip</i>
<i>I'm doomed now
Left to lay in the fields</i>
<i>I've got cash, you have beautiful lips
Let's meet and party hard</i>
<i>Chicken roast, manchurian
I'll have a go at them both</i>
<i>I search for you</i>
<i>I search for you everywhere
My sexy lover</i>
<i>Oh, my sexy lover</i>
<i>Oh, my sexy lover</i>
<i>O, my sexy lover</i>
<i>Give it to me!</i>
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>
Superhit! It's a superhit!

What is this?

Earth.

Dev, our land is our identity.
Does this all belong to us?
It belongs to me, your father
after that it is yours.
We serve it, we worship it.
Only then does it yield.
Once you grow up, you will understand.
Don't grow up. Stay my little boy.

Come here, see this plant.
We will take care of this
little coffee plant...
protect it from worms, from the hot sun.
Then it will grow and bear flowers.
We call it the Bloom.
The color of the Bloom decides...
whether the plant will grow coffee.
If the flower turns out to
be pink, everything is lost.
So with growing up comes its share of pain.
Not this, I am not liking this..
It's good right?
No, Lets ask Dev, What
should we name our house?
Thaa Mane.
Really.
My darling
Dev.
Don't cycle near the well..
You will fall inside.
This time I won't pull your out...
Aaa! Aaaa! Aaa!
Damaged the gate.
Crashed into a bloody tree this time!
Birju (ELEPHANT) has been
gate crashing a lot recently.
Lever is damaged.
You should stop drinking sir.
Moron!
I'm talking about the gun.
Here. Oil it.
For now, go see if the fencing is intact!
Hey!
Who's that?
May I help you sir?
Welcome!
Looking for a homestay?
No..I've come from Bangalore..
..Actually my coffee store..
..who-who is your trader?
No one. We are awaiting our first bloom.
I am looking to start my own
chain of coffee stores.
Haven't thought about
selling it to retailers.
Since when are you in retailing?
By the way, what are current market prices?
You know, we don't have any
money left for irrigating.
We've spent everything
on processing machinery.
Processing machinery! Yeah!
Hey tell me this.
Instant coffee. Has it
affected your business?
S-sir..uh..I-I'll see you later.
We could discuss business.
Later sir.
OK.
Your name?
Dev.
Anand? (LIKE THE FILM STAR?)
Dev!
Its-it's really you!
What are you doing here?
Uh..i-it's a fam-family matter.
You live around here?
No no..uh..I've come from Bangalore-
I'm here to source coffee
from some of these estates.
Okay.
I'm in a bit of a hurry. See you.
Dev, wait.
Come to our estate and
have a cup of coffee.
You live-you live here?
I thought you were a tourist.
No no me and my husband..
My husband and I..we have an estate and..
We bought it 5 years ago.
Okay. Bye.
Sometime later.
Your fate hangs by a thread.
No one knows how it gets
tangled up with other threads.
This thread of yours is kicked around
in the field of space and time.
The great samsaric (WORLDLY LIFE)
disco is being played now..
.. now..
.. and now.
2 kilos coffee grind please.
Puja (PRAYER) without showering? Not good!
I'm clean on the inside. Unlike you.
You come from earth. You return to earth.
And in between, you are
just a speck of dust.
I'm running late. Have to get to work..
Why don't you?
Why does he hate? Caught between pairs
of opposites, desiring results-
How much?
2 kilos.
When you dwell upon objects
of fancy, attachment.
Did you book your ticket to Coorg?
No.
I'm reading.
I got a notice from the bank.
We have defaulted twice.
- The store will be gone...
- Someday I will be gone too.
I run the store so that I
leave you with something.
Right?
This is why I sold our estate.
With the money we could pay bank
instalments, run the house.
But no. You don't want to touch that money.
The store, the estate. What
is to be gained by them?
Now you will say the estate
was our family heritage.
All our ancestors have their
ashes scattered over there.
For a Coorgi, land is God and I don't
care for that sentiment. Right?
You think you own something,
but it actually owns you.
I have this clarity. When will you get it?
You are right.
Your clarity has not left
any places for my ashes.
Because you are unworthy
to even scatter my ashes!
Why didn't you show up
for dinner yesterday?
Everyone was there.
Would have been a nice change for you.
Who needs change?
I am going to Delhi in the evening.
To conduct interviews.
Do something man. Atleast manage the store.
Mom isn't well.
Anything else?
Yes. There's an opening in HR.
I can sneak you in.
Who needs a sneak in?
Thank you. Close the door on your way out.
Okay so go Coorg no?
Why you not go?
I know mom well. She just
wants to keep me busy.
Why will Poonacha uncle supply
to a small time retailer?
Nothing in it for him.
So you won't go?
Go for her sake.
Dhoni?
Yes! My Dhoni.
That businessman? His name
is Dhoni (CRICKET PLAYER)?
His name Rohit.
What am I? His keep.
So he is keeper. Dhoni.
Dark humor. Very good.
Meaning?
You are a nice girl.
How come you got into all this?
Why do you ask? You are save me?
You are save me?
You ought to ask me if-
Yeah tell me. How should I ask?
Get away.
God! Why do you come here?
You come, but you never
do me what Dhoni do.
I am a Sannyasi (RENUNCIATE).
It means I have nothing
to do with the world..
.. nor the world with me.
Oh? That explains why
you didn't get married.
Why you don't work but your mom does.
Why you sold your mom's
property without telling her.
I am gone.
Come on.
I don't dance your samsaric
(WORLDLY) disco, okay?
Disco dude, Sannyasi never get angry.
Oh, come on.
Is there ever a valid reason to grieve?
If there indeed is, then
there is no way out.
And if there isn't a valid reason to
grieve, then why do we grieve at all?
You grieve for that which
isn't worth grieving over.
Mom?
Death?
Is death not worth the trouble?
No. Not even death.
Like everything in this world,
death is not real.
Where are you going to do the rites?
In Coorg.
Amma had asked me to meet Poonacha uncle.
I brushed her off.
Fought with her.
Hello Ganesh, do you remember
Siddanagar, Biddanda estate?
I was the one who sold it..
..No, not Singh..Dev Anand Cariappa..
..no just like that..
Okay.
Thank you.
They sold it to some Singh
who sold it to someone else.
After I finish her rites, I will
source coffee for the store
from Biddanda,
which was our estate.
Here.
I miss my mother.
My mom..
..she just passed away.
I had nothing to do with the world.
It is doing me now.
I can't do the worldly dance.
I just can't.
So? You want to become a
Sannyasi (RENUNCIATE)?
Why not?
A girl dumped you?
Or is it something else?
You said your mother passed away.
Do what she would have liked you to.
Renunciation can wait.
Believe me
even I have had a lot of
piercings when I was young.
I mean injections. No pain, no gain.
Papa knows best.
Trust me, kid.
That's it. All done.
Did it pain? No Right?
My sweet baby.
They'll turn out rotten if
you pamper them this much.
Dev Anand Cariappa!
Anika did mention you.
You two were friends in college, right?
Hi again.
Srinivas Panicker.
Oh. I thought you were Coorgi,
when I saw you with the gun.
Everyone thinks so. But you
aren't totally off the mark.
Mother Coorgi, father Mallu, grew
up in Dubai, worked in Australia.
I am from nowhere.
But yes, being half Coorgi..
.. I am allowed to carry
a gun, without license.
So Anika tells me you are a coffee expert?
You know all about soil, seed,
weather, water, cultivation etc etc.
I do. But-
Why don't you inspect my plantation then?
Give me some tips, Mr. expert!
Well..I-
Hey come on.
Let me be upfront.
My love, you want to source
coffee at a cheaper rate and-
See how I just called you my love?
I hope you don't mind..
So I was saying, I will give
you free coffee for a year.
We will work out a
discounted rate after that.
But for now..
.. I will pay a month's salary,
that is, if you help me.
The work is simple..
..manage the plantation and
supervise the workers. Easy!
Okay, Mr Dev I think I'm intimidating you.
I am like this...
But you know what I say, the
coffee bloom is just a month away.
What rhyming!!
Mr Panicker there's no one to
manage the store back home-
Is that all? We'll work out
a better compensation!
Mr. Panicker, I don't know if I can-
Listen Dev..
We are on a coffee plantation.
We will have coffee.
Let's talk over coffee.
Ok look, I'm requesting you.
You can have anybody take care
of your store for one month.
- Mr. Dev - It's not that easy sir-
I'll take care of your food and stay-
- I'll have to think about
it... You think too much.
Hi.
Ani sweetheart, you forgot to tell
me your friend is so stubborn.
Why don't you try and save me the trouble?
If you have to emotionally
blackmail him, don't hesitate.
Mr Dev, I'll be out and back in 30.
Please don't leave.
Ani don't let him leave.
At least not for a month!
See you.
Bye - Bye
I told him you wouldn't accept.
He knows?
Just that we were friends in college.
Friends!
You can just say you won't do it.
Why me?
He was looking for a cultivation expert.
I knew you had a coffee plantation
and you had worked in it so-
Your husband is very irritating.
He is a bit enthusiastic but a good man.
It was his dream to own
a big coffee estate.
We've attacked our last penny on this.
Why?
We were tired of the corporate
life and it was Vas' dream-
Oh! Vas' dream! Wow! Anika
I'm so thrilled for you.
So in the end, everything worked
out just fine for you. Didn't it?
What do we do now?
What is this?
Poison.
Wait.
I go to America for a couple
of years and you take poison.
We were going to go together, Weren't we?
Little did I know dad would lose his job-
I can't live without you!
This long distance thing. It never works!
Okay but-
- It just never works Dev!
- Okay! What do you suggest we do?
Let's get married!
- What?
- Let's get married.
If they freak out, your dad
and mine, we'll drink poison!
- Please baby!
- We'll show it to them!
- No no no listen to me.
- Let's get married!
- Calm down baby!
- No let's get married.
If not, let's drink poison!
Baby no! No poison drinking!
Baby no please, please!
- Alright let's get married.
- Promise?
Sure?
Yes. Ok.
Hello..
What's up? Deal fixed?
Anika is here.
What? Where?
Here man! Where the deal is to be fixed.
Right here.
So what now?
She and her husband..
They want me to help them
with their coffee crop..
Look man, I would have fixed it but..
Anika is right in my face dude-
Listen Dev. If you try to
flee, I will beat you.
One month right? Do it..
Focus on Amma. Behave with Anika.
Till the time you are there..
Seal the deal, come back.
I'll buy you a drink.
Bye.
Listen-
Look, I should have
behaved better with you.
It's okay.
I'll take up the offer.
Dev!
You're still here!
Looks like you couldn't
escape Anika's charm.
So, what's your decision?
I'll do it, sir.
That's fantastic! Thank you so so much.
Ani, arrange for Dev's stay
in our guest room. We have a-
One second Mr. Panicker.
I want to live with the workers.
Why would you want that?
You are Ani's friend..Ani?
You sure?
I'm very sure sir.
There won't be a discussion on this.
Okay. Whatever turns you on mate.
Disco dude! Disappear?
Still in Coorg?
I need your help.
Tell me what I need to do.
I have to stay here a month.
Once the bloom happens,
the deal will be sealed.
Until then, will you
take care of the store?
Please. For me?
Alright.
Don't blame me if I mess up.
Come back soon!
Thanks Shondha.
Mention not.
So this is your room. You
need anything, tell me.
Reminds me of a similarly small room.
After ages, you and me..again, in a room.
Ashtray!
Posh workers huh?
It's for you.
I'm tired. Want to rest.
Who's that?
Go check.
You didn't call your father!
Shit! Shit!!
Anika.
Anika it's alright.
What are you doing?!
Baby, just trust me.
We have got each other and we can do it.
Let's do it!
Lets have it.
No!
- No!
- Let's do it!
- No!
- Let's do it!
You do it first. I'll follow you!
Dev, you do it first. I'll follow you!
Anika.
Anika.
Ani have it! Have it!!
Anika come out.
Aha! Hot coffee!
If the universe so wills..
..we will have our own coffee in a month.
Just the thought of it is so exciting.
Dev, you have had a look now.
In your expert onion..
..will we be waking up in a month's
time and smelling our own coffee?
Uh, Mr. Panicker, it is vital
for a good crop that..
..the bloom doesn't turn out to be pink.
It is too early to say anything but..
..I have made a note of the
areas that need attention.
The plants that are north
and east of the well..
..haven't been bushed and pruned properly.
The sunlight is too direct
and humidity very low.
The soil-
Dev, no offence but all this
is too technical too boring.
I don't understand a damn thing.
Just tell me what needs to be done..
..and you do it!
Just make the bloom happen.
Show me some magic!
Mr. Panicker, I will
create best conditions.
I don't know about magic.
I don't look for it.
Then you won't find it.
I seek it and I believe
seekers are finders.
Fortunately, these are my plants..
..so it is my belief that counts!
Mr. Panicker do you believe in the..
..magic of the universe,
signs and all that?
Absolutely. Karma Dev, Karma.
The universe speaks to us all the time.
Not everyone is equipped to listen.
Not me. I'm different.
When ill fated winds blow my way..
I smell them a mile away..
And run the other way!
Baby, if my poetry stuff takes off,
I'm going to sell this plantation..
..and concentrate on that.
Coffee..
What are you doing?
What?
What are you doing?
Pondering.
About?
Whether I should try jumping
into the well this time.
Anyway, how did you find this estate?
Vaas is crazy about coffee.
He was on the look out for an
estate just like this one.
I told you this was his dream.
And you?
This is his dream. Where are you in this?
Is this your dream too?
Sorry. Continue.
Our agent showed it to us.
Some..Singh guy, we bought it off him.
Vaas took one look at this place.
Didn't take him a second
to decide to buy it.
It feels as if the artist has
morphed into an artisan.
You were an artist Anika..and now?
Now just a woman filling water near a well.
Like one of your own paintings
Dev, go.
Why?
Why?
My being here is problematic to you?
That little episode, fading
away in your memory..
..me being here has
refreshed it, hasn't it?
What the hell are you doing here?
A dutiful housewife, are you?
An extremely supportive wife, helping her..
..husband live his dream
while her own rots away?
Sorry, sorry. Continue-
Sorry go ahead fill that water.
Clear it up quick.
There..there.
So you are still an artist.
Like I was.
Still a crappy one?
There's a cultural fest on.
Will you take me?
Listen, I'm sorry about
what I said at the well.
I didn't personify maturity either.
Sorry back.
It'd been a week since I showered.
I didn't mind it.
Does this feel weird?
A bit, yes.
How did you meet Srinivas?
I wasn't thinking about marriage.
Vaas' family became
family friends in Dubai.
My parents were after my
life..that I get married.
Vaas took a liking to me.
There was Vaas and my parents.
There was a lot of pressure.
So I figured..if I HAVE
to ruin someone's life..
Why not this fellow's?
How about you? Any girlfriends?
Girlfriends? Me?
When I woke up..
..at the hospital it was to a new reality.
I was told that your
parents took you to Dubai.
Everything had changed.
People were awkward around me..
..friends, relatives..and parents.
I would be stared at on the streets.
Mom and Dad who were
always very cool with me..
..started coming into my
room 5 times a night.
'Need anything? Are you feeling warm?
Should I turn on the fan?
Do you need a bottle of water?'..
..on some pretext or the other.
I knew they were coming in hoping
to find me alive each time.
To cut a long story short,
I dropped out of college,
stopped meeting people,
It's been 13 years.
At least you've had a happy ending.
Oh. I've come to my end have I?
Don't happy endings depend
on where we stop the story?
If we stop it right here, now..
Is this a happy ending or a sad one?
""Should I speak?""
""Or stay quiet.""
""The eyes...""
""are doing the talking.""
""Should I speak or stay quiet.""
""The eyes are doing the talking""
- Should we go?
""The one that smiles and deserts you.""
""What should I call this now?""
""Life is simple.""
""But emotions are complicated.""
""The silence reveals everything.""
""Is it what I think it is.""
""The forgotten emotions..""
""What union is this.""
Vaas! What are you doing?
Baby, the drinks are on me.
You bet they are.
Oops.
Baby.
Why don't you drink a proper drink?
Dev, kindly make a drinkable drink
for our malkeen (OWNER) here.
Vaas, stop with the malkeen business.
Hang on. Let's get to the bottom of this.
What is the name of this house?
The name man?
Thaa Mane.
Correct.
Why did we retain the
name when we bought it?
Because-
I'll say it. Because..
My darling wife Mrs. Anika Panicker..
..finds the name enchanting.
Though she has no bloody
clue what it means.
By the way, what does Thaa Mane mean?
Mom's home.
Really?
Who's mom's home?
Never mind.
Point is, this house is in her name.
Know why?
Number one.
She is my goddess of wealth.
Hello Wealth Goddess.
Number two.
Like number two, anything
I buy in my name..
..is separated from me.
Crap. Sheer bad luck.
Karma, Dev.
Mr. Dev, please excuse me, I have to pee.
Babe.
Baby.
Go
I'm high.
Go.
Can I do it in the bushes?
Go home.
It's my plantation man!
You own all this?
You know Vaas, he believes
in signs, omens and whatnot.
It is so stupid.
So yes, all of it is in my name.
Hey, didn't your family
own property in Coorg?
I remember you telling me.
Is it still there?
Had to sell it.
Hi.
Hi.
Can I have some cold water?
Sure. Come in.
So? What do you think?
Overdone. Too much decor.
You cannot not find fault, no?
You asked for my opinion. There it is.
Yes, Why did I? My bad.
Here.
You don't drink coffee now.
How is Amma?
And Prahlad? Rest of the gang?
Prahlad is an IT Manager now..
..rest of the gang are busy
leading their grown up lives..
..Amma passed away.
I'm so sorry Dev.
What happened?
She had her ailments and
her time was up I guess.
Just that..
..there must have been a
better way for her to go.
What do you mean, Dev?
It's nothing. Never mind..
I miss her.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't trying to take
advantage of your empathy.
I know.
No I'm sorry.
Dev, it's okay. It was just a moment.
Now I remember why I fell for you.
It's because I'm not a drama queen, right?
No. It's the way you kiss.
Dev-
Listen Listen please..Just.
No, don't say a thing.
I'm happy..after eons! In fact..
..I should be going now.
Dev-
No, don't say a word.
You're regretting the kiss now.
Yeah, you are.
Look Dev-
I know this isn't 1997.
I know you're married.
I know you'll be feeling weird.
But every time you happen to
even accidentally look at me..
..is a half-hearted, fake smile necessary?
- It's nothing like that.
- How would I feel?
What, you're thinking morals?
15 years ago, only I was in your life.
Now it is Srini, for the heck of it.
It can be me again. Anika,
morals are flexible.
Cannot happen.
Why? Don't you feel anything for me?
Anika, listen...
I don't have an issue with Srini, but
I like you and me better.
Give us another chance-
Anika, we have a history.
And I have a present. I love my husband.
And not for the heck of it . It is real.
And me?
I can't begin from the beginning, with you.
It's exhausting.
I care about you but..
..you and me together, we are poison.
Literally.
Did the kiss mean anything to you?
A left over reaction. Of
a time that and whatnot.
I'm sorry if you felt it was the
start of something, but it's not.
It'll rain soon, the bloom
will happen and you will-
Dev!
Get out!
Get out!
Ani!!
Ani.. Have it.
Ani!!
I can't do it!
I can't do it! I can't!
I can't do it!
Clamoring for love from
others, you forget..
..what your true purpose is.
To discover yourself.
Everything dependent on others
is the cause for misery.
You take yourself for granted.
The whole of existence hides inside you.
You do not need approval from others.
Own up to what is yours.
Get up and fight!
My dear!
Shondha!
Of course it's me Shondha. From Bangalore.
But you-you should have called.
Who's at the store?!
The bank people come every day.
You don't take my calls.
And Dhoni's family..
..moved to Canada. He threw me out.
So you came here?
So where should I go?
Wait, wait.
You may stay here.
Listen, if someone asks,
tell them you are..
..my friend from Bangalore. Okay?
Okay.
Really good you came.
Very good.
Still not worthy?
How much longer?
Let her go soon.
How long are you going to stay here?
The rains are arriving..
In a week, the bloom is awaited.
. On the 8th day, I will become worthy.
How?
This is so sweet!
Hey!
- What are you doing?
- Just a sec.
Step aside, mama!
Where are you off to?
To celebrate with Dev.
Take an umbrella..Dry yourself.
What the date today? 7th right.
On the 15th..
..at a plantation that is ours..
..there is going to be a coffee bloom!
What the hell are you up to Dev!
Dev!
Where are you Dev Anand? It's raining!
Let's celebr-Oh!
You're already celebrating. Sorry,
I didn't know you weren't alone!
It's fine Srini. This
is my friend Shondha..
..from Bangalore..to see me.
Oh.
I hope it's not a problem
if she stays a few days.
What problem, Dev?
Please sit Shondha.
I'm Srinivas Panicker, the
owner of this plantation.
Oh, hello.
Dev, the universe has given me a big sign!
Yeah. I saw the sign too.
Now it's just a matter of time.
Why don't you join us for tea..or coffee..
..that won't be our own, yet!
You could meet Anika.
She's trying out a new recipe.
If I'm going down I'm taking you two along!
Dev..Please come for sure.
Shondha see you later.
Oh..Forgot the sweets.
Meanwhile, carry on with
your 'celebration'.
Good one Srini... Good one...
Please have something.
Very good madam.
Thank you.
How do you know Dev?
I had been to this temple like thing..
..for a heart-breath discourse, right dear?
Art of breathing.
Yeah. We became friends there.
What do you do?
I keep.
What do you keep?
I keep of Dhoni, meaning Rohit-
Not now though. I'm looking for a job.
Dev is helping me with it.
Let's just have some coffee.
I'll pour.
Okay. So it's decided.
Once the bloom happens, we'll have a feast.
Which is bad news for the pigs.
Great idea. I'll just go to the kitchen.
OK, baby.
We'll all pig out.
Sir!
What's the matter Dasappa?
West side sir! Brown spotting on leaves!
Looks like a disease.
- Let's have a look.
- You wait in the room.
Right here, sir.
Nothing to worry. Looks
like a minor infection.
Quite common right after it has rained.
It's called Coffee rust.
Nothing a little brushing
and pruning wont heal.
Are you sure?
100 percent sure?
Of course. It's nothing.
Will this affect other plants as well?
Will the bloom be affected?
No, not at all.
Still, I'll make double-sure.
I'll look at it closely again.
Relax Srini, nothing to worry about.
Dasappa, keep an eye out. Let me know..
..or Dev, if you see more of this.
Damn.
Bloody Chinese shit!
Don't worry. Everything'll be fine.
Do I look worried to you?
Yes.
Yeah I'm worried.
Dev will manage everything, right?
You never mentioned Shondha.
Was I supposed to?
You are sure right?
Is there reason to worry?
About the Bloom?
No.
Are you not sure or should I not worry?
You don't know how much the
forthcoming bloom means to Vas.
Believe me, I do.
He has entered into equity partnerships.
Ordered machinery from South America.
In ten years, he wants to start
a chain of coffee stores.
Really?
He knows neither the 'C'
of coffee, nor of Crop.
But he has ordered machinery!
This is sacred earth.
It asks for service, care, worship.
Only then does it yield.
Not so easy...
What?
What would you do without me?
You guys are the limit!
No respect for the land.
No respect? What are you talking about?
I'm doing my job.
I came into this late, yet I am
working my ass off for you people.
That too in my own-
In your own what?
In my own area of expertise
you question me!
I know what I'm doing.
Brown, brown, brown! This,
and this, and this!
They're all dying!
What the hell is going on?
Some of them don't react well
to the rains. It happens.
Oh I need to move them indoors now?!
Some don't hold up well.
Due to the soiling, due to inadequate
moisture Could be anything.
Don't confuse me with jargon Dev!
And what do you mean 'could be anything'?
What kind of an expert are you?
Find out the damned problem and solve it.
Srini, you are overreacting.
You will lose 40% of the crop at most.
The rest will survive.
40%?! That's almost half of them gone, man!
I'll do something. Will try to
bring the loss down to 15-20%.
That is if the universe helps me out.
Will you? Will you show me some magic?
That's on the universe, no?
I'll do what I can. We'll see.
You..don't seem confident, Dev.
Thats what is killing me.
Baby, let's take a second opinion.
Good idea.
I'll talk to Shenoy. If he is
in town, he'll come inspect.
I need your photo.
Oh!
Take it.
Where's the camera?
If anyone stays for more
than 3 days in a homestay..
..we need their photo on record.
For police verification.
If not, they question us.
Meaning?
Passport, voter's ID..anything?
Will a ration card work?
I'm asking for a photo ID.
- Why?
- Homestay rules.
Did Dev give his?
I know Dev very well.
I too. Very well.
If you don't have one, you can't stay.
You have 2 hours to pack up and leave.
I'll leave when Dev tells me to, not you!
This is not your property!
- Oh? Is it yours then?
- It is Dev's.
If I tell Dev he will throw you out
with your joker husband even..
..if you show him your
entire photo album. Get it?
Who told you this is Dev's property?
He only.
This whole thing is his family's property.
So YOU pack up. Alright?
Oversmart woman!
What was your family matter again?
As I have said, to source coffee.
That is business, not family.
Why did you come here?
Because your husband begged me to.
But why this particular plantation?
B. Devanand.
B stands for..Biddanda, right?
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
So this was your family's property that
they had to sell. And you're here to-
I sold it. Without telling them!
I'm sorry about that but this
is legally our property now.
This is not mere 'property'.
Right where you are standing, is
where I learnt to ride a cycle.
Thaa Mane.. which you don't
even know the meaning of..
..is MY mom's home!
It is my identity.
I haven't been able to let mom go yet!
She died heartbroken because of me.
You know what she told me? That I'm
unworthy to even scatter her ashes!
What do you want?
Talk to him. Sell it to me.
I want this land back.
Sell it to you?
What do you mean sell?
And pack up and leave?
- Just like that?!
- Yes.
Can't do that.
You know what this estate means to
Vaas and you know how much he loves-
Loves coffee? He doesn't know a thing.
He doesn't want to either.
All he wants is magic!
And you? You're worse than him. You
think you're supporting his dream?
This is not his dream.
If this doesn't work, well,
there's always another..
..fancy idea, another crazy
adventure to sign up for. Right?!
- Get out of here!
- And if I don't?
I'll have to tell Vaas.
Oh really?
So will I.
- What do you mean?
- About us.
What?!
'What?!' I'll have to tell
him about our romance..
..about the hotel room, about the
rat poison, which was your idea.
Except you fed me but
chickened out yourself.
I have nothing left to lose!
He won't believe you.
He is mature enough to understand that
you and I, were done a long time ago.
Oh yeah?! But the kiss..that was now..
..atleast according to me.
Let's find out Vas' opinion.
He will forgive me.
Possibly.
But then again, the poor man has taken..
..huge loans, invested a
lot, ordered machinery.
The bloom could turn Pink.
He's under a lot of stress.
And to top it off, the kiss. So
it's possible he won't forgive you.
Convince him to sell the land.
It's up to you to decide
if you want to tell him..
..it's me you are selling it to.
Let's not let it get ugly.
Baby
I hope the bloom turns out well.
Really has to come.
If it doesn't, we'll have to
cancel all retail contracts,
carry all machinery on our heads
and flee from the loan people.
What happened to you?
What do you mean?
This is careless ambition.
Whoa!
I'll take that as a compliment.
You thinking I've ambition..
Is good enough for me.
Be it careless.
You want to destroy my life?
There is no destruction.
Just a change of hands.
From one to another
I'm just taking back
what's rightfully mine.
You're not the Dev I once knew.
You're the Anika I once knew?
They took me to the police station.
Asked me if I was kidnapped.
Dad, did not even speak to
me and sent me to Dubai.
He was ashamed of me.
You didn't even contact me even
to see if I'm alive or not-
Prahlad..
I contacted Prahlad.
It was not just you who's
reality had changed.
You were passing out and I
did not know what to do.
I was young and I was stupid.
I get it. I got the poison,
you took it, I didn't.
That explains all this, right?
What rubbish!
Why do women mix issues?
We were both equally stupid.
This has no connect with that.
You know I was hoping you'd say..
..Anika the poison was your
idea, I took it you didn't.
My life got ruined, so here is payback.
What?
I understand revenge, but this is worse.
Elephant on the loose... Elephant.
Hey, distract it there..
Everybody, please do not panic!
Please go into the bushes and stay there!
Dasappa, bring me my gun. Quick!
Stay in there..
Hey ..we are coming.
Quick Dasappa!
Vaas!
Vaas!
Vaas!
Vaas!
Vaas! What happened?!
Vaas..
Why are you here?
I came to see madam.
What are you doing, my dear?
I don't get it.
You haven't scattered Amma's
ashes, you lied to them..
..about the land, didn't tell
me the truth about Anika.
Is this right?
No my dear, it isn't.
You are lecturing me? You?
I shouldn't?
Because I keep?
I care you, my dear.
I don't know what is right,
but I know this is wrong.
You are a lovely boy.
You always respected me.
Think about what you are doing.
I have said too much.
I'll go now.
So you're the chief cultivator here.
Sannyasi sir!
I am speaking to you.
We have talked but not
introduced ourselves.
My name is Annappa, ASI,
Siddanagar Police Station.
B-but y-you-
Yes yes.
Vacation.
Vocation.
But I don't get this.
Mr. Panicker went into the
woods, gun in his hand.
But after the shot was fired,
the gun was in your hands.
Sir, how many times do I tell you?
The lever was jammed, it
misfired and went off by itself.
How did it come to be in your hands?!
Nobody saw the shot being fired.
You were with him and the
gun was seen to be..
..in your hands.
Sir, please ask Mr. Panicker himself.
He will tell you I'm telling you the truth.
Of course I will, when he comes to.
That is, IF he comes to.
You aren't getting it.
You are in trouble, my friend.
Until this clears up, you
will be in my custody.
I'm-I'm going to jail?!
Yes.
For now.
At least until the
investigation is complete.
If you're innocent, I'll
let you go of course.
We will then have a chat
at the temple where..
..you can ask me about Karma, destiny etc.
But if you've been up to some mischief..
..then you'll have ample time
to ponder over the truths..
..of life, and maybe even learn some of it.
Don't worry, everything will be alright.
Sign here.
Thank you, sir.
Anika, wait!
Get in the car.
Thanks for getting me out of there.
You didn't have to.
I did.
Vaas gave a statement as soon
as he regained consciousness.
You didn't have anything to do with it.
The gun misfired.
We are leaving.
I convinced him, pointed out all
the signs and omens to him.
I used his weakness against him.
Also emotionally manipulated him.
Moreover, we don't know
the 'C' of Coffee, do we?
Let's see where his next
fancy idea is going lead us.
Here's your stamp of worthiness.
Proof that you have made it.
It's a MOU.
We will complete all formalities
in a month and leave for Dubai.
Take it.
Anika..
You sabotaged the bloom.
Shenoy told me..
..there was clinically administered
wheat rust everywhere.
Only an expert could pull that off.
Anika, I'm sorry.
I broke Amma's heart. Because of me she-
I couldn't even express to her that-
Amma would be happy now?
This is not about Amma.
This is your need to get even with me.
You blame me for whatever
happened that night..
..and for your subsequent life.
You can't stand the fact that
I am happy with someone.
And you tell me that I mix issues?
Maybe Vaas doesn't know
a thing about coffee..
..but poisoning the trust of..
..that which depends
entirely on our kindness..
..only a true lover is capable of it.
We both have lived up to it.
And..
And I don't think we could
have done differently.
When you dwell upon objects of fancy,
attachment is born.
From attachment is born desire
and when that desire is thwarted, anger.
From anger comes delusion
and from delusion, the loss of
everything valuable you have learned.
From this loss of values, the
mind becomes incapacitated.
And when the mind is incapacitated,
the person is destroyed.
But the one whose mind is steady
he moves in the world of desirous objects
free from likes and dislikes
and attains the clarity of
what is right action, what is not.
There is nothing more
fascinating than clarity.
There is nothing more
fascinating than clarity.",32594

Dimple Chaddha, a spoiled and wealthy Delhi girl, falls for her fitness trainer, Sunny Singh, who charms her and pretends to be interested in marriage. He tells her about a disputed inheritance involving a property occupied by tenants. Dimple persuades her father to use his influence to evict the tenants, and they even lend Sunny ₹20 lakh to help him claim the property. However, it is later revealed that the inheritance was fabricated and the tenants were legal occupants. Sunny vanishes with the money, leaving Dimple heartbroken and embarrassed.

Meanwhile, in Mumbai, successful businesswoman Raina Parulekar purchases an expensive painting from Deven Shah, who claims to run an art gallery. Shortly after the transaction, Deven disappears with ₹60 lakh, and Raina learns the painting is fake. She publicly shares her story, which draws the attention of Dimple. They connect and are soon joined by Saira Rashid, a shy and trusting woman from Lucknow who was conned out of ₹10 lakh by a man named Iqbal Khan, whom she was romantically interested in.

The three women realize that Sunny, Deven, and Iqbal are the same man operating under different aliases. They nickname him “Bloody Kameena” (BK) and hatch a plan to con the conman. Raina, using her resources, finances the plan. They recruit Ishika Desai, a sharp-tongued and confident saleswoman from Mumbai, to pose as a wealthy NRI heiress and lure BK in.

Tracking him down to Goa, they discover he is now operating under the name Vikram Thapar, posing as the owner of a beachside water sports business. Ishika approaches him, pretending to be the daughter of a hotel-chain magnate looking to invest in a restaurant. Vikram quickly takes the bait and begins to court her, unaware of the setup.

To impress Ishika, Vikram offers to fund the restaurant’s launch. Meanwhile, the women feed him fake bills, cheap materials, and fake staff, slowly recouping the money he stole from them. As Vikram grows closer to Ishika, he genuinely starts falling for her. After a successful launch party, he and Ishika spend time together and share a kiss. The next morning, he discovers Ishika meeting with the other women and realizes he has been conned.

Determined to retaliate, Vikram manipulates the situation and sells Ishika a worthless property for the restaurant. The women, believing Ishika has betrayed them, confront her and ask her to leave. Later, they find Vikram waiting at their hotel. He confesses to his past cons and expresses remorse, claiming he now understands how it feels to be deceived. He offers to return all the stolen money and insists he wants to turn over a new leaf.

As the women prepare to leave, they notice Ishika is heartbroken over Ricky, and they decide to help reunite the couple. Ricky, now revealing his real name, proposes to Ishika and tells her he wants to learn how to live honestly, with her help.",2894,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt1954598.srt","Wow Dimple!

Hello uncle
- l have told her so many times.
Uncle, there's a lot of weight here,
Let me put her down
first then, you can scold me.
l think she can answer your
questions only in the morning.
Who are you?
Sunny. Boyfriend.
l am a trainer at the
Power house gym. GK branch.
Dimple and l met there.
Upstairs would be better?
Aunty
You are a body builder, right?
So body builder, now tell me,
what did you do to my daughter?
Had l done something l wouldn't
have brought her back in one piece.
Out here they are killed
and stuffed into an oven.
l respect you a lot Sir,
Dimple has told me
everything about you,
self-made man...
To start from a garage...
...and establish such a huge
property empire is no joke.
l wanted to meet you myself,
but not like this.
With a presentation of a plan for
a chain of All-lndia Gymnasiums...
anyway not now, you must be tired.
l'll make an
appointment and meet you later.
l am your daughter's boyfriend.
l won't do anything wrong.
Trust me.
Should l park the car inside?
How will you go home?
Bus, auto, l'll take anything,
l left my bike at the gym.
Take the car and bring
it back in the morning,
but don't get even a scratch on it.
l won't get a scratch on it,
Not on the car nor on your daughter.
Good night Sir, aunty...
Good night, son
l had to brush four times to
get rid of the Vodka smell.
What if papa had caught me? And you?
Walked out making a good impression,
and making me look like a fool.
Couldn't you stop me when
l was chugging the shot?
What happened? Why did we stop?
Should l get off?
What're you doing Sunny?
What're you doing Sunny?
Where you going Sunny?
Bloody murderers,
finished off my mother and father,
you will rot in this house.
Why are you throwing stones?
Broken all the panes, you die...
Shut up, you bitch,
Netarpal! Netarpal! Oye, Rawat!
Catch him, don't let him go.
Run Sunny Run
Start the bike,
go go go...
Where are you running? Stop.
Sorry.
Sunny, tell me the full story.
You've lost 3 kilos,
you deserve a chocolate.
l am leaving.
- Listen...
You have enough problems of your own,
why do you want to hear mine?
you call me your girlfriend,
can't even share your
problems with your girlfriend?
That house is mine
Yours?
My grandfather built it,
papa was born there...
when my grandfather got transferred,
he put the house up for rent.
And when he came back those Mother...
those MFs did not leave the house.
My grandfather filed a case.
Fighting the case, he died first
then my father and then mother,
along went the entire bank balance.
After three deaths the court
ruled in favour of the tenants
under the Rent Control Act of 1947.
Now, they pay only 1,500
rupees rent for such a big house
and l pay a property tax
of 60 thousand every year
and if l don't pay up then
l get an arrest warrant.
l am sorry, l didn't mean to grumble.
Your pain, my pain
No, you look best laughing.
Don't get involved in my tears.
We will all laugh together,
and make those MFs cry.
How?
Good evening Dimple ma'am
Papa help, there is big crisis.
Dimple? Mr. Kamal is here.
Uncleji, can you step out please?
Mr. Chaddha, what's this nonsense?
2 minutes please
Not nonsense! l am Dimple Chaddha.
This shop is named after me.
l am telling you
politely to wait outside,
once our meeting is done then,
you can have your's.
OK? Happy? Out!
Papa, help us.
Us? Means?
- Me and Sunny. Ours.
Get Sunny back his bungalow.
Sunny has a bungalow?
Yes, on Barakhamba Road.
Sunny owns a
bungalow on Barakhamba Road?
Where do you think you are entering?
Throw this out
Throw this out as well
Take this, break this, come on.
Uncle can l have a look inside?
Of course, it's your bungalow,
you are the landlord.
You are the king.
Dimple!
- Yes mom?
No issues, have a good look.
lt's a proper bungalow.
Nice, isn't it?
lt's cute. lt has an old world charm.
Come up stairs, there's more.
Ya lets go
From where?
- Come from here.
We are going upstairs.
Papa made this map himself.
He was born in this room.
Papa Sunny's father was born here,
it's so exciting isn't it?
But the condition of the
house is not very exciting.
That's not the point uncle.
l am sure, Papa and Papa's papa
are both thanking you from there
you made it possible for his son
and his grandson to stand here.
Son's son.
You won't be standing for long.
lt's best you sell this while
the market is still piping hot,
No uncle this house
has an emotional value.
Two crores, it will fetch,
just like that.
With a constantly leaking roof,
these seeping walls,
you will always need security here.
How will you manage on your salary?
Sell it.
Buy a 4 BHK flat for
1 crore in a suburb
Either in Gurgaon or Greater Noida.
and with the rest start a gym.
You can't be a trainer
all your life, can you?
lsn't it a plan?
Pamme, get the bag...
Now where will you run
around selling-buying?
Fine this will be on my own head.
No l can't trouble you.
Dimple's problem, my problem.
20 Lakhs advance, rest 180,
after the deal is done.
Done?
Done?
Done.
Superb!!
Will you keep staring at
the cash or will you hug me?
Not her, me!
Bye, Sunny
You don't care if it's
a friend or an enemy.
You've taken his 8 crore
house forjust 2 crores!
He is our Dimple's boyfriend!
So he's not going to be
a boyfriend forever...
Papa!
l mean, soon he will
become the son-in-law...
and everything will be his...
right Dimple?
What is this nonsense, Sharma?
lt's not nonsense, it's a warrant.
You entered my house
and beat up my people.
Arrest him.
You say it's yours and
l should believe you?
Mr. Sharma l've bought it, legally,
from Sunny Singh.
An advance has been paid,
the entire paper work is ready,
l even have the original
map made by poor Sunny's dad.
Only the registration is left.
- Registration is not possible.
Why is not possible? - Not possible
because, a family feud...
...has been going on
since my father's death.
A stay order has been
imposed on that house.
lf you have a map l have the
original documents for this property.
l don't see any Sunny Singh in these.
l think he's tucked you up.
Listen carefully.
- Yes sir.
Call Surti...
Tell him before sunset my bail
should be done before sunset.
lf l have to spend even
one night in jail, believe me
l'll have everyone
buried in this market itself.
Papa, where are you going?
Papa what happened ? Sharma Uncle?
The Urban Ministry's secretary
happens top be my brother-in-law.
He'll usurp my bungalow.
- Put him in there...
Papa, don't be scared, l'll
be there with Mummy and Sunny
lf you meet Sunny again l'll
break your legs. No meeting Sunny.
Let's go Sharma.
Why Papa?
No he was Anup's substitute.
He was to leave on Friday,
but he left three days early.
But Anup will be back on Friday.
But it looks like
Sunny really suited you.
You're looking fit.
What're you scared of?
Why don't you give your papa,
that picture of Sunny, you took?
Dad will kill me if l
even step in front of him.
Thank God he got out on bail today,
or else it would be my neck.
l am sure even your dad
wants his 20 Lakhs back right?
Give it. Your dad will find him.
He's not going to get us
married even if he finds Sunny.
Papa is going to kill him
in the centre of the market.
Now a Sunny-Dimple
match is impossible.
You're impossible.
Still dreaming of Sunny.
lt's Papa's fault as well.
Sunny hatched a clever plan...
...but Papa should
have been a bit smart too.
Why was he duped?
l love him Gurmi.
You are crazy Dimple...
At times, one has to lose to win,
and that player is

the price. Buyer is king.

The bosses will punish the culprit.
So be ready to be fired.

You look like the transport type guy!
Now move it, l am getting late.
lt won't move till
everything is off-loaded.
Keep honking
Careful! Careful! Careful!
lt's not a painting, it's a Hussain.
M. F. Hussain. lt's a masterpiece.
Do you know how much it's worth?
lf something happens to it then...
Carefully
- Yes Sir.
Just be careful! Easy does it!
One second. How much is it?
Five bucks for 100 grams.
Eat in or take away?
Okay, l know it's not peanuts.
lt's art, creative and all that,
but how much are you selling it for?
lt's an exhibition for art lovers.
Over here?
My gallery, lndigo. The
opening is this evening.
lnvitation. Come over if
you are interested in art...
lf you want to buy spicy peanuts
then the Mithibai
College has the best chutney.
ldiot!
lndigo... lndigo... lndigo...
Deven ldiot Shah...
Market value Rs. 80 lakhs.
Not for sale!
Why not for sale Mr. Shah?
Why not?
Looking for the price tag?
5 bucks for 100 grams, freshly baked.
Ninety lakhs... Deal?
And l thought you were
genuinely interested in art.
lt's to decorate the office.
What?
l like honest...
l hate fake.
lt's impossible to buy.
Nothing is impossible.
Honestly. The
painting isn't mine to sell.
lt's borrowed from the Suri
brothers for the exhibition.
Mr. Suri Steel and Power Suri?
- Yes.
Manoj and Maneesh Suri. Joint owners.
Couldn't you have said that earlier?
You wouldn't have been here then.
You would've found
someone else to flirt with.
l can set up your
meeting with the Suris.
lf you can convince them,
you can have your painting.
And you your commission.
lt's a hard-earned commission,
no cheating.
Raina Parulekar
Deven Shah...
Call me Dev.
Deven, if possible it would be better
to have a meeting
with the older brother.
His position is weaker,
he will surrender faster.
Surrender! To Raina the tigress...
The meeting should happen tomorrow.
The day after the painting has to
be up in office for the opening.
At such short notice, only a
phone conversation will be possible.
Phone is good... Bye then...
Sir, l need the financial
stats of Suri Power and Steel...
Buying-selling ratios...
last quarter...
Forget about the Suri's,
Raina, we are two days away.
Concentrate on the Hussain.
l am focused on that sir.
Hello?
- ls this Raina Parulekar?
Yeah. - l am calling from Mr. Manoj
Suri's office, to inform you that
Mr. Suri is not interested in
selling his Hussain painting.
Oh, but we are offering
more than its market value.
l don't know ma'am,
it's Mr. Suri's decision.
l am just conveying
the message. Thank you.
Wait, wait, wait... can you
let me talk to him please?
My boss's orders,
l have to get that painting.
Please
Okay...
only an employee can
understand another.
l will try...
Hello. Manoj Suri here.
We will not sell that painting.
Hussian is the pride and
glory of Suri Steel and Powers.
Hussain is the life of our company.
Mr. Suri, the market value of
the painting is Rs.80,00,000.
We are ready to pay 90.
You are ready, l am not.
One crore
lt's an insult to Mr. Hussain.
One crore twenty final.
You are insulting me...
lt's your younger brother
who is going to insult you.
What do you mean by that?
You and me both know
that your brother wants
to take 51 percent of the shares
so he can sideline and
eventually oust you.
There's bound to be a
spilt in the company
and its assets.
Will the Hussain be yours or his?
Who would've thought that one's
own brother would deceive them?
lf we pay you half in cash,
the rest 60 Lakhs by cheque...
with receipt,
which will officially
make the price 60 Lakhs.
Half of which will be your
cheating brother's part,
making his total 30 lakhs,
and your share 90 lakhs.
l hope causing him a loss of 90 lakhs
will be give you some
sort of... how do say it?
Peace...
yes it will give some peace.
So, deal?
Yes, but give the lndigo broker,
his commission on the full price.
Why should he incur losses
in my fight with my brother?
Mr. Manoj Suri... you
are a very nice man.
l know l know...
anyway, take the
painting from the gallery,
give the boy his commission
and also hand him my
suitcase with cash in it.
Get the cheque sent to
my office by speed post.
Are you sure?
Hand over 60 lakhs in
cash to that Dev guy?
He is a sweet simple chap,
he won't even open the bag.
Okay, bye.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Careful, guys please.
Tigress Parulekar,
so you made Suri surrender.
Worked that magic. Very nicely done.
There is no such thing as magic.
Honest, hard work.
A cheque for your commission,
-Thank you.
and this briefcase for Mr. Suri
lt will reach him.
All clear between us?
All clear.
Cheers to Raina!
To Hussain!
Since his death it's
become more precious.
Sir Mr. Suri...
Manoj Suri?
- Yes sir.
Please tell me, when
are you getting here?
Forget that, first tell me
how did you set claims
on my Hussain painting?
We never had any deal,
What rumors are you spreading?
Hello...
Call Raina... Now!
Yes sir.
- The painting is not a fake, Sir...
Mr. Suri is confused.
Mr. Suri is the owner
of Suri Power and Steel,
not a desperate manager level employee
who will use cheap
tricks to get ahead.
Not a cheap trick, Sir.
l only followed your orders.
The orders were to get a
genuine painting, not a fake.
How will l justify such a big scam?
Not a scam, Sir...
mistake
Really?
And who will prove
it's a mistake or a scam?
l'll prove it, Sir.
You'd better Raina Parulekar.
You'd better
At times, one has to lose to win,
and that player is
'The Ultimate Winner'
Raina Parulekar, someone
has conned your company
and sold a fake
Hussain painting to you.
How are you feeling?
There is speculation that
it's not a con but a scam,
and you are involved in it too.
Do l look like a scamster?
Am l a thief?
l have a B Tech degree
from llT, and an MBA from llM.
Raina don't, let the
lawyers handle it.
No, Sir, let me speak.
l am an honest employee of
Synergy Communications...
l love my job, this company.
l will never con my bosses,
l've been conned.
A man called Deven
Shah has conned me...
Surely this is not his
real name or his first con
For him it was just a
way to make a quick buck
but for me
my honesty, my identity,
my commitment,
my job, my future all is at stake.
l am going to track him down,
recover the company's money,
get him arrested and prove he
is the criminal and l am innocent.
Yeah?
Raina from Mumbai?
Who is this?
Dimple from Delhi.
You have the wrong Raina,
l don't know any Dimple...
Parulkar na... Raina Parulkar.
Paru... lekar.

got your number from the channel.
l have strong feeling
the guy who conned you
Conned me too.
Yes Raina
Yes, Deven Shah is Sunny Singh...
Did he also make you his
girlfriend and dump you?
l am stupid but not that much.
You mean l am stupid?
l didn't let it get to that.
But he conned me for 60 lakhs.
Lol! 60! He could only get 20 from me.
You are more stupid than l am.
OK, l am more stupid than you.
OK, listen l am getting another call,
l'll call you back.
Hello?
Hello? ls that Raina?
Yes?
Can we talk? l hope
you're not in the office?
No l am at home.
Have those horrible people fired you?
Who are you? Questions upon questions,
Where are you calling from?
Lucknow. My name is Saira...
Saira Rashid.
Six months ago a man named lqbal Khan
cheated me of 10 lakh rupees.
and he disappeared thereafter
l'm not sure if lqbal and
your painting guy are the same
but if you could tell me more...
Saira l am going to send you a photo.
Have a look and then we'll talk. okay?
Hello Raina...
- And Dimple Chadda...
Saira l am Raina, and on the
other line is Dimple from Delhi.
Dimple, did lqbal con you as well?
Yes, as Sunny Singh.
Did you get the photo?
Yes, it is lqbal.
l took it. lt's useful isn't it?
You are really smart Dimple.
Raina? Did you hear that?
Saira, tell me the truth,
did he make you his
girlfriend as well?
lf you give Saira a chance to speak
then she can actually
tell us. Tell us, Saira...
lmmediately after my
graduation l was married off to Adil.
You're married... love marriage?
Arranged.
After three years Adil
died in an accident.
His parents are just
as nice as he was.
l've been with them
for the last two years.
So when did you meet Sunny?
While going to my shop in the morning.
Stop stop.
No hell would break lose if you stop.
Hey, don't touch them.
l picked them.
l missed my bus, You can't enjoy them.
No way.
They look so sweet,
but taste like poison.
Ticket!
Pass!
Pass... don't say it, show it.
What happened? Has the pass failed?
l left my purse at home.
Show your pass, or buy a ticket.
l don't have money,
l'll give it you tomorrow.
l always take this route.
Madam get a ticket or else get off...
Should l buy one? Ticket?
l am already insulted,
l don't want to be a beggar now.
Return it tomorrow,
l will also take this route.
Hazrat Ganj.
Two for Hazrat Ganj.
Even my business is that side.
Thank you...
Mention not...
One for Hazrat Ganj.
Give it to him please.
And yours?
Take it
She bought it
Thank you!
Mention not!
He had done his research.
From which bus stop, and
at what time l take the bus.
Which area the shop is in,
what time it opens, everything.
By buying of the ticket,
and the thank you the mention not
he got familiar with me,
and soon reached our lane.
Hey listen,
Shambhu take the payments.
Hey Mr. Suitcase?
Blue shirt?
My mind had glazed over, l smiled
and led him right into the shop.
Royal Cloth Merchant. Our shop's name.
My name is lqbal
l am Saira.
What's the rate?
Rupees 450 a meter.
He even chose the right
time to enter the shop,
Greetings.
- Greetings.
he knew my father-in-law brings
lunch at that time. - Greetings.
Just as father entered,
he began showing off
his knowledge about fabrics.
Khan, lqbal Khan.
lt took him hardly ten minutes
to have my father
wrapped around his finger.
Tie-dye is popular here?
Yes. There's an entire
colony for the tie-dye.
Which way would that colony be?
Which way would that colony be?
lt's through the by lanes,
you'll get lost if go on your own.
l would've shown you had the
property tax guy not been coming.
Saira why don't you show him?
Me?
Ya go ahead. l'll manage here.
OK.
While he was showing his
fake sympathy and kindness,
l was melting like an idiot.
Cold drink?
lce cream?
Shall l show you something?
Allah... the Pandora's
box is opening today.
What is this?
Real intricate threadwork Zardozi.
l've never seen such
intricate work before.
We have our own workshop in Bareli,
traditional weavers.
As there are no
sales in smaller towns,
my friends said that
Lucknow would be the right place.
Now the dealers here
show interest but not cash.
l am almost through
with the money l had.
Back home my mother and
both my sisters are worried.
l'd better head back home.
lsn't it exquisite?
What are you quoting for this?
400 rupees a meter
No one is ready to pay
even 400. Such swindlers!
And they will sell it for a 1,000.
Your losses won't be a profit to us!
But 400 is too low my friend.
l'll give you 500 rupees a meter
And l'll place an
order for 5,000 meters.
10 lakhs advance... and the
balance of 15 lakhs on delivery.
Agreed?
Poor father, he struck
the deal blindly for me.
Hoping that this friendship would
turn into a relationship,
and end my loneliness.
Have some sweets to celebrate.
Wow
The following day father
gave him 10 lakhs, cash.
He promised to
return in two weeks time.
Wring the Zardozi
Saree around his neck
and hang him in the city centre.
That's provided we find him.
You guys have his photo why
don't you inform the police?
lf he gets to know the
police are looking for him
he will go underground, and
we will never get our money.
No police.
Look, l have a plan.
Everything will be
possible if we join forces.
Why don't both of you come down?
lt's impossible for me.
Papa has imposed various bans on me.
Fine then sit in your homes,
and let more Sunnys and
lqbals make fools out of you.
Bye.
Go
lt has been bothering me too.
But then l didn't say
anything thinking about Adil.
l was wrong...
But even if Adil is not
here anymore... you are.
No, you are not going on any trip.
Gurmi, Puchki, Choti are all going.
Well no bodybuilder in their
house has swindled them of 20 lakhs.
lf l have done something wrong once
it doesn't mean l'll
be doing it all my life.
Even you have made many mistakes.
Weren't you conned in the
Bhatia shop deal, for 12 Lakhs?
The Pancholi Bunglaow,
the Preet Vihar flats,
but did you shut down your property...
...business because of your mistakes?
You've grounded me!
l never thought you'd play such a
double standard game with me Papa.
Let her go.
Dimpy, will you travel
business class or economy?
Raina!
Dimple?
Come on, l've been
waiting for so long.
But l was right here.
But you didn't come in front of me...
Okay, sorry.
Nice glares...
Aren't they?
Are you still in mourning for Sunny?
No.
So why black-black?
l like black.
l like colour...
Suits you.
Saira's flight arrived before yours.
She hasn't even
switched on her phone yet.
l am Saira
You run a shop?
Yes Dimple.
Hello Raina
Hello
Let's go.
How did you guess l was Dimple?
You're very special,
people know you instantly.
Okay so how will we
get our money from Sunny?
From lqbal
Dev, lqbal, Sunny whatever
from that Bloody Scoundrel...
ldea. His name will
be Bloody Scoundrel
to avoid any confusion.
To extract money from
the Bloody Scoundrel
we will con that con.
Con what con?
Con means to cheat.
He cheated us, now we will cheat him.
We will plant a bait in front of him.
Our bait will pretend
that she has a great
investment proposal to multiply money.
Bloody Scoundrel will
invest his money in that,
and through our bait we
will get our money back.
Simple.
Simple? Who will be 'The Bait'?
There is one.
l have someone in mind.
Through the thorns,
pluck the roses

the tree of snoozes.

A month or two.
No way, l've finished my paid leave.
To do this l'll have to take time off.
l get paid 30 thousand a month.
Five lakhs... your fee,
and all expenses paid.
What if he is a psycho-rapist?
He is not a rapist...
actually he is very nice.
He is only interested in money.
Cold calculated unemotional...
What pain his con causes
is no concern to him.
l am doing my job well...

Let it be... Excuse me.

Amandeep Chandigarh. 9915682870

Hello?
Amandeep you're a guy or a girl?
You're an aunty or an uncle?
Your dad's the uncle!
- Dimple
No speaking. Just listen.
Takes all sorts
Next.
Hello? Who is it? (in Gujarati)
Shailen Sharma Bilaspur
Has the consignment arrived?
Diego Vaz. Goa.
l'll do it, she can't even dial.
Never gets through.
So what? You didn't get
through the first time either.
Next
Where are you hiding Scoundrel?
The fourth guy Dimple
called is calling back.
Diego Vaz.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
The Bloody Scoundrel is in Goa!
This is your planning?
Had we told Papa, he would've
booked us into a five-star hotel.
Miss Dimple, l wish your papa
had financed this entire operation.
We would've stayed
in a five-star hotel,
hired a Mercedes, thank you.
But l'm very sorry, this is all l
could manage with my small savings.
lshika's fee, food, transport,
everyone's tickets, chips,
cold drinks.
But it's not an obligation, right,
once we get money from that
Bloody Scoundrel? - Volume!
When we get the money
from Bloody Scoundrel,
you will take your cut first
and then give us ours, right?
lf we get and when we get...
and what if we don't?
Don't be negative.
lt's going to be fine.
God willing.
Wow... what a great bed.
The two of us can fit in easily.
That room.
Why? Aren't we roomies?
Sweetie, first you stop snoring
then you and l can be roomies.
Till then, Saira and l are here.
Okay, rules:
This is my friend
Sasha's house, not a hotel.
We have to leave it in a
better condition than it is now.
The maid comes in
the morning to clean,
but no one says
anything in front of her.
The rest of the work will be
divided equally between us.
Why didn't you specify earlier
that we'd have to be maids as well?
Change the SlM card.
Don't even know how to change a card.
That's why you're still
a Manager and not General Manager.
At times, one has to lose to win,
and that player is

Drive? l'll fly.

He seems lonely,
not even a soul to
share a meal with him.
How do we know there is no one?
No!
He's never getting into that trap.
So then what is he is doing
here alone with all our money?
Looking for another victim l guess...
had he found one he
wouldn't have been in Goa.
Hello lshika.
We found the Scoundrel.
Take the first flight out!
OK.

Hello... yeah my card

How can it be blocked you block-head?!

Twenty four hours!
What will l do without

You know l will sue
you for this... Raina!
He is not even looking at me.
Drunkard's just chugging it down.
l am paying cash and leaving.
Okay Bye.
Hi, so l'm just going to pay
you by cash, how much was it?
lt's ok ma'am your bill has
been settled by your friend
Which friend?
Excuse me!
since when have you become my friend?
Since the white shirt and
blue jeans became your enemy.
Listen l don't have time for this...
So just tell me how
much you paid for my bill
Blue and white paid, not me.
Bartender said you...
l pointed to the
blue and white's card,
the bartender was so hassled he didn't
notice whose card had l pointed to.
He presumed it was mine. Simple.
Very classy thief!
Classy! Thank you.
Thief?
He misbehaved with you,
l punished him.
That's no theft
That is theft.
Feeling guilty? Then apologise to him.
But if you want to
thank me for punishing
Him, then there's a
better bar in Colva.
Now l get it. l've known
guys to pay the bill and flirt,
but dude without paying!
Excellent.
But l am not in Goa to party
or see cheap tricks
from hunks like you.
Try it on someone else.
Excuse me
- Ya?
Sorry but there's been some confusion,
can you pay the guy
whose card was used,
l think they're over there...
ls he is a ghost
that he just vanished?
lf she gives so much attitude,
he will vanish.
lt was a perfect plan lshika,
you ruined it.
He was convinced that you
are a damsel in distress.
Damsel in distress!
No one gives a second
glance to damsels these days.
l can't play a damsel.
We've hired you! You have to
play according to our rules.
Miss director, l am the one who
has to deal with him face to face.
You can't press a remote and have fun.
l am not an actress, l
have to play it my way.
What if he were to
catch me acting, then?
The partnership idea has to
be sold to him, l'll sell it.
l've never let you go empty
handed from the mall, have l?
Ok but now we have to
think of a new move.
Don't worry the next
move will be made by him.
With hearty compliments
from Mr. Vikram Thapar.
Vikram who?
- Mr. Thapar, Goa's beach king.
Out of all the water
sporting between Varca to Anjuna
at least a dozen are owned by him.
lncluding the one at our hotel.
You met him last night at the bar.
That's Vikram Thapar?
Yes ma'am.
lnteresting name.
- lnteresting man.
lf you want to thank him, then
you can find him at the beach.
Have a nice day ma'am.
- Thank you.
This is finished.
How will we run the
business if he does this?
Tell him.
Grease.
Mr. Beach King, credit card trick
didn't work so you sent flowers?
They always work... here you are
So l was right.
Last night's drama was to attract me.
You are so attractive what could l do?
Thank you...
for the flowers.
ls it from your own
money or stolen cash?
Did they smell nice?
So how does it matter then?
l want to go for a ride.
Come, l will take you
- l will drive.
lf you are not here to party
then what're you doing here?
To prove that l can
also set up a business.
Prove to whom?
- To my Father.
l told him l wanted to set up a
chain of restaurants in lndia,
he thought it was stupid.
Do anything in the U.S.
but not in lndia.
After numerous fights
he has conceded that
l first set up the project
like land, licences, clearances,
staff everything, and then
he'll invest five million.
Five million dollars is...
- Twenty five crores
Right.
But do you know how much
he's given me for my trip?
Five lakhs including transport,
hotel food.
But l'll prove it.
l won't leave here till
my restaurant is set up,
even if it means
sleeping on the beaches.
l can help you set up your restaurant.
Really?
But why?
Oh lone girl, millionaire dad,
trap her, take her money.
ls this the plan?
Right! This was my plan.
But you're so clever,
you don't need any help.
Goa is waiting for you.
All the honest officers, land owners,
cops, collector, ministers.
They will help you honestly.
You have a good evening
Hey... Mr. Beach King!
Want to have a beer?
l don't want any favours.
Do you want an equal
partnership of sharing,
But profit sharing will be 60-40
You said equal partnership?
My idea, so 60 mine. Agreed?
Okay agreed.
You will also have to
invest in the partnership.
Oh.
Obviously.
Why do you think l am
letting you be my partner?
l'm not going to run
away with your money,
all the expenses will be
transparent and for the yacht party.
Yacht party?
See
whenever l go to meet somebody...
they don't take me seriously.
lf we organise a yacht party,
good food, music, wine,
invite all the important people
in Goa, put photos in the press.
Just see, the phone
won't stop ringing.
Entire Goa will help our restaurant.
That's how we promote in the states.
Had l the money, l
would've had the party,
and started the restaurant by now.
How much will we need for the party?
A crore perhaps.
As soon as dad
sanctions his 25 crores,
your money will be returned.
So partner or no partner?
Partner.
How much for this?
One can get shoes for 500 rupees here.
And that one?
Which brand?
Mango, Diesel ,
Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci,
What time is it?
Tripping on these Jalapenos
We have to leave now,
come on, come on, come on...
l'm not done eating...
- We have to leave, he is not going to
Wait for us all day.
What's the rush, is
it an American thing?
What happened?
- You have got to be kidding me man...
What're you doing?
Watch out, watch out. What the hell?
No price tag?
We'll put it when we get there.
Ya Gaurav? On our way.
Hey Gaurav what's up?
- You are looking nice.
Come, come, come.
Ok... that's Saira
- Hello
This is Dimple.
- Hi - Hello
Ladies on a mission huh? Come...
Like a fool l rushed here,
didn't even pack properly.
All the money is
going to the hotel bill.
l think l should shift from
Pallazzo to a cheaper one star hotel.
From the money l save, l
can buy a dress at least.
You won't be able to handle a one star
So what to do?
l don't have a dress for the party.
Let's go shopping!
How sweet...
This is what they are
wearing in New York now, like now.
lt's lovely.
- Prada!
Beautiful.
Ninety thousand only.
Only!
One dress is not good enough,
l mean atleast...
l need at least eight,
matching foot wear,
jewellery, accessories.
Take everything.
lt's an investment for our future.
l mean business future.
And its backless.
lts good.
Now thats nice.
lts nice.
Nice couple.
But the boy is short.
Why don't you get heels?
l can't believe we
have shopped so much.
Sixteen lakhs fifty thousand.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Mind blowing.
Thank you.
Ohh my God...
Okay okay enough hugging kissing...
Let's get to work.
Phase two!
Can you talk lshika?
Listen yachts are
parked at the Madovi Jetty.
One of them is my
friend Fardeen's Yacht.
He has explained
everything to the captain.
He is all set.
He will ask you for the
entire payment in advance.
Then you take over.
The yacht is Brown
in colour and called
Freedom. Freedom it is!
So?
lncluding food and beverages,
and 6pm to midnight
will be 20 lakhs in total.
Too much no?
That's 40,000 dollars.
ln the US this party will
cost at least a 100,000 dollars.
Actually it's a good deal.
Aye aye captain sail the boat.
Full advance payment in cash,
then booking, then sailing.
Done.
How much is this?
lnvitation card
Oh. Gorgeous.
Here you go.
Ninety rupees
ls this the cheapest?
Only mango juice will
be cheaper than this.
Forty bottles please.
How much?
20 and 50
l'll take all
A 200 bucks bottle
is now worth 90,000.
Thank you
So far we've earned 45 lakhs.
After lshika's fee and all expenses,
we are left with 35.
lshika Patel you are a genius.
There are at least 8 investors.
ln fact we might not need
your dad's money anymore.
No. l don't need anymore partners.
l am happy with one,
whom l can trust completely.
No really, for any
business trust is crucial.
Right,
trust is crucial.
Oh my god! Vikram.
Once more, once more.
We never had any in our childhood
so l go crazy when l see them now.
Papa got us 1 of each firework and,
they would be finished in seconds.
l would be angry with the
fireworks when they finished so soon,
wondering , why have they finished?
But why rationing on the fireworks?
Your father could've
bought an entire factory right?
Had my father not rationed in
the beginning of his business,
then how would he have
become the Motel King?
Let's go.
Let's go party
Haven't we just been to a party?
That wasn't a party, it was business.
lsn't it late?
ls someone waiting for you?
Alright Vikram Thapar let's party.
Let's party.
She isn't answering.
Booking was till 12.
Party must have
finished long time ago.
Real romance has happened
between the calf and the butcher.
Real romance.
Raina, if what she is
saying is true, then?
Then my dear,
we are screwed.
All night party!
While we've been
rotting in that hell-hole,
she is living it up in the 5 star.
Partying with Sunny all night.
l had to go with him
to build his confidence.
What other debaucheries did
you do to build his confidence?
Raina, please tell her to shut up.
l am not going to shut up.
You are in Goa for us.
We've hired you.
We are footing the bills.
Not for you to hang out with my
ex-boyfriend like shameless bitch.
That's enough Dimple.
You are always taking her side.
Dimple, just shut up.
Do you have any idea how
worried we've been all night?
Any idea?
l am really sorry.
Champagne, beer, yacht,
brain got a bit side tracked.
l promise it won't happen again.
l am on your side.
Now the focus is to
defeat the Bloody Scoundrel.
Down with the Bloody Scoundrel.
We haven't even
recovered half the amount yet.
We've a long way to go.
Don't ditch lshika.
l won't.
Dimple, come on.
Hi, you haven't slept?
l want to show you
something mind blowing.
OK, let's go
l know, even my mind
is completely blown.
Wow!!
This land is perfect
for the restaurant.
Very nice.
Actually it's perfect.
Let's make it here.
Let's talk to the owner.
Wait, wait, wait partner.
Before we go ahead l
want to share a few secrets,
after knowing them you might
want to break the partnership.
What secret can that be?
l'm not breaking the partnership.
You will also have to
tell me your secrets.
l don't have any secrets.
You can tell me yours.
- l am a conman.
l am a thief.
For the last 15 years,
l've conned 30 ladies.
You are the 31st.
Friendship, partnership...
...investment in your
project has all been for this.
My plan was to run
away after fleecing you,
but l fell in love with you lshika.
l am not lying.
l have lied a lot.
l've spent my entire life alone,
even if l wanted to be
friends with someone,
l would scold myself and restrain,
but since l met my
heart won't listen to me.
Do you...
love me?
Will you marry me lshika?
He proposed to you?
Liar. Look at her face.
He never proposed to me,
why would he propose to her?
lt's not a proposal,
it's a con silly.
The biggest con of his life.
After marrying her he
will have her, her father's,
the land's, the
restaurant's money in his pocket.
With an investment of 40 lakhs,
he plans to hit the
billion dollarjackpot.
That's why l was wondering
why is he buying her all
these dresses and shoes for?
He will marry for money.
Marry him.
No way. Are you crazy?
This is the best way to
get the rest of our money.
How?
Her father won't marry her...
...off to a thief like Vikram
Thapar without any security right?
And for that security lshika's
father will ask him to buy that land
in her name.
Before the wedding.
So will she get married to Sunny?
No, the plot will be
bought before the wedding.
We'll sell it
immediately after its registration.
Take our money, and get
on the first flight home.
Not bad Saira.
Can you clear one matter first,
will she or wont she
be married to Sunny?
No.
lshika will only accept his proposal.
Make him speak to her father.
Right we have to find a papa for her.
Let me figure this out.
l'll make tea.
l'll leave.
No, let Raina finish her call.
Did he give you flowers?
What?
When he proposed. Ring?
No
Plain?
Kiss?
You guys must have definitely kissed.
l am conning him,
and he is conning me.
Where did the kiss come from?
Kiss is a bitch. lt
creeps up anywhere.
Ok papa sorted.
lshika tell him l do, l do, l do.
Before that, let's find
out the value of the land.
lt's a fair deal ma'am,
don't worry.
Owner is settled in Dubai,
l have the Power of Attorney.
l'll do the formalities.
Final price 90 Lakhs.
No bargaining. Sorry.
Ninety Lakhs.
My gosh!
- Yes, yes.
Really?
Mind-blowing!
Papa call time!
Papa.
Hello Mr. Patel.
Vikram Thapar?
Yes sir, Vikram Thapar.
Let's come straight to the point...
What's the turnover of
your water sports business?
Not even 50 Lakhs annually.
lshika's shoes almost cost that much!
Sir, honestly l don't
have your kind of money,
but lshika's happiness
is most important to me.
l promise to always keep her happy.
My dear a promise has no value.
My dear a promise has no value...
bills cannot be paid by promises.
Moreover, how do l know you are not
marrying my daughter for her money?
Tell me.
Sir, l love lshika not her money.
l can't just believe what you say.
Trust needs proof.
lf you want to marry lshika,
then buy a land of her
choice registered in her name
for her restaurant.
l'll make the rest of the
investment in the restaurant,
but if you buy the land
then l'll be rest assured
that she has some security.
That's my condition.
What happened? Can't
give the security?
l'll give sir, off course l will.
For lshika l'll do anything...
The butcher becomes the calf.
l am telling you, the
scoundrel is in love.
He can't love anyone.
He is laying his trap
slowly and steadily.
He is getting caught up in it.
l am trapped.
l've made a promise but
l don't have 90 Lakhs.
l have only 45 left
after the yacht party.
So now?
Had l not met you, l could
have conned someone for it easily.
But now l can't do it.
l love you...
but how will l give your
father security? l don't know!
We will have to give
the rest of the 45 Lakhs.
Crazy? We've got it
with so much difficulty.
With our 45 and his 45,
he will buy the plot.
Hopefully when we sell it
we will get more than 90,
and we'll recover all our money.
Okay lshika, tell him you
raised 45 by selling yourjewellery.
Okay?
But Raina,
what if he has genuinely
fallen in love with me, then?
what's going on here?
Love what else?
l told you she's a traitor.
He is leading you on.
He can't love anyone.
He loves me... perhaps.
lshika waved the magic wand
and the scoundrel became
a caring, honest lover.
Believe me he has changed.
lf you look into his eyes,
you will see an honest man.
Enough lshika.
Even l've seen his eyes,
when he spoke to my
father-in-law about his poor mother...
...and sister and stole our 10 Lakhs.
lf you don't want to
carry on, it's ok.
But don't mock us. We're
stupid and you're clever.
When he vanishes after
breaking your heart,
that's when you will realise her pain
and know that we are your
well-wishers, not that rogue.
Raina...
the money for Vikram.
Are we crazy to hand over so
much money to a thief's girlfriend?
You will run away with it.
Aren't you in love with him?
l am.
l am in love with him.
But l'm an honest
sales girl, not a thief.
Less salary, tough life,
but l feel proud when my
bosses praise me for my honesty.
l wouldn't sell that
feeling even for a crore.
l won't cheat you.
Trust me.
l'll return all your money.
Promise me, no more lies.
l love you.
l love you.
Owner?
Mr. Abhay Salaskar.
He is settled in Dubai.
Power of Attorney is with me D'Silva.
Buyer?
lshika Patel.
Sign please.
Ma'am sign here please.
Hundred percent genuine!
lshika
Sorry, and Thank you.
lt's okay.
Sorry. Thank you.
l can't wait to see his face
when he sees us and
realises that he has been duped.
But where is the scoundrel?
This is fine. - Hello, hello
excuse me, what are you doing here?
Flood control.
Where's the flood?
lt's not here now, but it
will come after the monsoons.
Who gave you permission?
We are the new owners of this land.
Take our permission.
You? lsn't the owner Abhay Salaskar?
Was. He is in Dubai now. We bought it.
For 90 lakhs.
90! Lakhs!
- Cheap deal isn't it?
What would be its market value now?
3 Lakhs
with great difficulty.
This is a swamp. lt's under
water for 5 months. What value?
Check the deed, may be there
is an extra zero by mistake.
Even 9 Lakhs is too much.
David, Abhay
Salaskar has cheated them.
Ninety Lakhs.
What's your cut?
What?
How much will that
scoundrel give you out of the 90?
ls it a 50-50 or a 60-40 partnership?
Was it his idea because an idea
is worth more, or was it yours?
Shut up Raina.
- You double crossing bitch.
Shut up Raina.
- Liar, thief, bloody scoundrel.
Raina, shut up!
lshika...
- Shut up all of you...
l did it for you
and you are accusing me?
Calling me a thief?
To hell with you.
Raina!
Had lshika cheated us,
then why would she come here?
Don't abuse her for your defeat.
The scoundrel has cheated her as well.
First, he bought the
land himself, for 3 Lakhs
as Abhay Salaskar from Dubai.
Then he gave the Power
of Attorney to D'Silva.
lshika met D'Silva
who quoted 90 lakhs.
Out of which we gave 45 Lakhs.
After signing the deed
D'Silva gave the entire
money to Bloody Scoundrel.
Aren't l too good?
l had boarded the plane
after the security check,
but could not take off.
For the first time, it was no fun.
l conned girls because l
thought it was a game,
which l would win.
l never stopped to think,
that along with cash,
what else the girls lost.
Now that l know,
the game is no fun.
l thought l was
superstar Shahrukh Khan,
but this time,
even though l won, l have lost.
Your money.
lts 1 crore
You have straightened
this Bloody Scoundrel out.
l can't do con jobs anymore,
and l know nothing else.
Thanks to you all,
l will have to learn honest work.
l am not good at saying sorry,
so
Hats off boss!
Hats off
lf you ever meet lshika,
tell her my proposal was real.
l really fell in love with her.
But she turned out
to be a real player,
hats off to her as well.
Abhay Salaskar!
How does he come up with these names?
Sunny and l were dating seriously...
and l wondered why
isn't he going first base?
First what?
Kissing!
So l thought, l'd take him there.
l came on to him in the night club,
but he didn't kiss me.
He could have taken advantage,
l was ready,
but he didn't exploit me.
But he doesn't know how
much lshika loves him right?
No, only we know.
No, no, don't do that.

l went off track once and lost out
but now l won't make a mistake,
l want to mint money.
Not a good plan!
l've been there done that.
lt's no fun making money on your own.
Let's be partners,
same deal 60 yours, 40 mine.
No lies, no cheating.
Your brains, my courage,
world's best partnership.
You've conned 31 girls right?
l don't want to be 32nd.
l will constantly be
seeking the truth in your lies.
l was telling the truth then,
l am telling the truth now.
You were lying then,
you are lying now.
You might feign anger but
your eyes are saying, clearly,
that you are happy to see me here.
That's why we are made for each other,
we won't be able to lie to each other,
because we will be caught out.
A 100 % true partnership of two liars.
lf you are so in love with my lies,
then why did you leave me and go?
lt was my last con,
how could l have lost?
lshika Desai, l love you...
Marry me
Straight to marriage,
don't you want to test me as
a girlfriend or something?
l am the No.1 conman,

Ricky!
What kind of name is that?
l don't want to marry

better groom for you than Ricky.
l don't want him anymore,
l just want to go home...

"8","tt7471004","The House Next Door",2017,"Plot

The movie starts with the happy life of a mother and daughter back in 1934. In the present, 2016, Dr. Krishnakumar (Siddharth), a successful neurosurgeon, and his wife Lakshmi (Andrea Jeremiah) live peacefully in their beautiful house under the mountains in Rosina Valley. The D'Costa family moves into the next house, which belonged to the mother and daughter years ago. Jennifer D'Costa (Anisha Angelina Victor) is a troubled teenage daughter of the neighbors. Though she is rebellious, she deeply loves her family and her half-sister Sarah. Jenny and Sarah come to meet Lakshmi and make friends with her. Jenny is instantly attracted to Krish's charm.

The D'Costas invite Krish and Lakshmi for dinner. While exploring the house, Krish sees Jenny jumping into the well and saves her. Jenny's rebellious nature makes her do things like smoking. During one such time, when she sneaks out of the house for a smoke, she picks up some belongings of a dead person. Jenny starts to act weird soon and sleepwalks to the edge of a cliff, where her father Paul (Atul Kulkarni) and Krish save her yet again. Jenny's grandfather contacts a psychic, but Paul refuses to take any help from him. Krish refers them to his psychiatrist friend Dr. Prasad (Suresh), who gives Jenny a hypnotherapy session, and she tells him that there is someone telling her family to leave the house, and then Jenny starts speaking in Chinese. Prasad concludes she has developed paranoia with visual and auditory hallucinations and advices Paul to perform an exorcism since he is sure of some paranormal behaviors happening with Jenny. Paul calls Pastor Joshua (Prakash Belawadi) to perform the exorcism, and they find that their new house is haunted by three ancient Chinese spirits. One of them is a bloodthirsty man, while the other two spirits are the mother and the daughter, who want the family to get out of the house without trouble. The exorcism session cures Jenny, but the violent antics of the spirits injure Joshua, who falls into a coma, while Krish and Paul are also injured.

Things seem normal, and Lakshmi finds out that she is pregnant, but one day, Paul's housemaid disappears. Krish and Lakshmi also witness increasing paranormal disturbances in their daily lives. Paul finds some disturbing evidences in his house and agrees to call the psychic from earlier, and he reveals the presence of a mother and daughter spirit, asking them to leave. He also discovers their skeletal remains in the nearby cliff edge, along with the male spirit's remains.

Meanwhile, Prasad feels that there is more to the story of the spirits from Jenny's exorcism and upon researching finds that there is a witness who knows what happened in Paul's house 80 years ago, an old lady from the village. Krish and Prasad visit the old lady, who reveals that the man of the house, Lu Wei, was into black magic. He attempted to kidnap and kill her when she was a child, but his pregnant wife intervened and let her escape. It is shown that Lu Wei tried to perform the human sacrifice as a ritual so that his next offspring would be a boy. When his ritual was disturbed, Lu Wei heartlessly lures his own daughter and sacrifices her instead. Lu Wei's distraught wife witnesses this and stabs herself in the stomach, killing her and her unborn child and thereby ruining Lu Wei's plans. An enraged Lu Wei commits suicide by drowning himself in the well. The old lady further tells that all these events unfolded during a rare solar eclipse day, and a similar eclipse is bound to happen again the next day.

Krish and Prasad go back home and seemingly continue to discuss the events. The next day, Lakshmi calls out for Krish and asks him to help Jenny, since she is possessed again. When they go to Jenny's house, to Krish's surprise, Lakshmi locks him up in a room. It is then revealed that Joshua awoke from his coma and told Lakshmi that during Jenny's exorcism, he found that not only Jenny was possessed by the woman's spirit, but Krish was possessed by Lu Wei's spirit and the possession must have happened when Krish jumped into the well and rescued Jenny. Lu Wei now intends to continue where he left off and targets Sarah for his human sacrifice so that Lakshmi would give birth to a boy. It is shown that a possessed Krish had earlier killed Prasad too, since he found the truth. Krish breaks free and tries to kill Sarah and cause mayhem, but the Chinese mother-daughter spirits overpower him and destroy Lu Wei's spirit from Krish's body as the solar eclipse ends, and Krish gets back to normal.

A few years later, it is shown that Krish's family and the D'Costas are still good neighbors, while Lakshmi and Krish now have a son, with whom Jenny and Sarah go to play. The screen closes in on the boy's eye, which changes to show double irises, implying that he could be demonic, since he was conceived when Krish was possessed by Lu Wei.",4912,NA,NA,NA

Devki Sabarwal is a vivacious biology teacher who is popular with her students. However, her stepdaughter Arya rebuffs her attempts to build a relationship despite Devki's persistence and warmth, as she still misses her biological mother. One day in class, a student Mohit Chadda sends Arya an inappropriate video; Devki throws his phone out the window. When Arya is invited to a Valentine's Day party at Zodiac Farms, Devki and Arya's father Anand reluctantly allow her to go. Arya rejects the advances of Mohit and his cousin, Charles Deewan, at the party. Angered by the public rejection, Charles, Mohit, their criminal friend Joginder ""Jagan"" Singh, and farmhouse security guard Baburam Yadav ambush and kidnap Arya when she leaves the party. They brutally gang rape and strangle her, then dump her in a roadside ditch, leaving her for dead. Arya is found barely alive by a man walking his dog the next morning, and brought to a hospital; Devki and Anand are shattered. She suffers serious internal injuries, but recovers over the next month and names her attackers.

Inspector Mathew Francis quickly rounds up the perpetrators; however, the case falls apart when Arya is found to have consumed alcohol at the party, raising the possibility that her memory is unreliable. In addition, the tardily-collected semen samples are too weak to match those of her attackers. The four men are acquitted due to a lack of evidence. Arya, in shock and broken by the verdict, withdraws and tears away from Devki. The family's lawyer suggests appealing to a higher court, but Devki has lost her faith in the legal system.

Devki remembers a shady detective, Dayashankar Kapoor (""DK""), whom she had met at the police station on the night of the crime. Having a daughter himself, DK understands her pain and agrees to help her seek revenge for Arya's ordeal. Devki enlists her former students to attack Baburam, and they seduce and drug him. He awakens four days later, still drunk and remembering nothing, and discovers that he has been castrated. In a state of shock, he dies in an accident. Devki then breaks into Charles' home and mixes crushed apple seeds, a source of cyanide, into his powdered nutritional supplement. Charles is paralysed, and when Mohit visits him at the hospital, Devki (tipped off by DK) plants apple seeds and other evidence at Mohit's home; however, she leaves behind her glasses. Mathew quickly arrests Mohit and he is charged with murder since Charles is dying.

As Devki eliminates each of Arya's attackers, their stories appear on the news, which Arya sees. She starts to believe that a vigilante (perhaps her father) is at work, and is deeply grateful. Mathew also suspects Anand, since he had attacked Mohit in court; he has Anand tailed but learns nothing. Mathew finds Devki's glasses in Mohit's apartment and begins to suspect her. He warns Devki that the fourth man, Jagan, is a hardened criminal and going after him will endanger her family. Jagan visits Mohit, who is being physically abused by another inmate in prison and insists he was framed. Jagan then visits Charles, who tells him ""Mom"" before he dies, revealing Devki is the perpetrator. Jagan goes after DK and learns that Devki and her family are on holiday at a snow cottage in Kufri. He kills DK and tracks down Devki. Mathew later finds a hidden camera in DK's glasses and hurries to save Devki.

Jagan cuts the power to the cottage and shoots Anand. He corners Arya but has a scuffle with Devki while Arya flees outside. Jagan chases her, and Devki tries to save her stepdaughter. Jagan is about to kill Devki when Mathew tackles him. In a standoff, Devki and Mathew point their guns at Jagan; Matthew tries to dissuade Devki by telling her that Anand is alive, and she will go to jail if she shoots Jagan. Jagan angrily describes how Devki finished off the other attackers, which Arya overhears. Devki knows if Jagan is left alive, he will come after her again; Mathew then hands her his gun and urges her to kill Jagan. Devki hesitates, but when an overwhelmed Arya calls her ""Mom"" for the first time, she shoots Jagan dead. Arya and Devki share a tearful, tender embrace.",4173,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt5690142.srt","I haven't done anything, man!
Ma'am has come...
'Get your girlfriends along...'
Good morning, guys.
- Good morning, ma'am.
Good morning.
Early morning...1st lecture.
And that too biology...
Sad, no?
- Yes, ma'am.
But... it's important to study.
But waking up at
<i>6</i> o'clock in the morning...
Should be of some use...
Isn't it?
By the way, did you catch
the Sci-fi film 'Space Bound'?
Yes, ma'am. What a movie!
Is it good?
Have you seen it.
- I think I've seen the trailer.
Why don't you go with him?
- Why should I?
Blushing and all, huh!
Nice movie.
Well, today we'll study the different
muscle groups in the Human Body.
There are 639 muscles
in the Human Body...
...and each has a unique function.
Let's start with this portion here.
' Rectus us Abdominus I nus'.
Also known as...
Popularly known as the six-packs.
Mind blowing...
- Hello, guys.
This is still a biology class.
Concentrate.
The function of the
'Rectus Abdominus' is...
...flexing at the abdomen.
It runs vertically
across the stomach...
...and is separated from the
skin by a layer of fat and water.
You' re a pervert!
This is called the Transverse abdominus.
- What happened, Arya?
Look, what he has sent.
- And these here are the oblique's.
Yuck!
- They are...
What's going on there?
Nothing, ma'am.
What happened here?
Nothing, ma'am.
You both leave the class now.
Ma'am...it's not our fault.
Look what Mohit sent to Arya.
Everyone knows
'No phones inside the class'.
Give me your phone.
I am sorry, ma'am.
Your phone!
I won't do it again,
promise, last chance.
I won't repeat myself.
Tell your parents to come see me.
Now back to class.
Is my black suit
back from the cleaners?
Yes, it's in the closet.
Sis is coming.
- Okay, sit down.
Madam... what's in your hand, madam?
It's nothing, madam.
It's definitely something, madam.
Chocolate. Your sister
gave it to you, didn't she?
How did you know, mom?
Mom has 10 eyes...
She can see everything.
Even I can't hide anything from her.
Show me your 10 eyes.
Show me. Show me.
- No...it's a secret.
I can't tell you.
Come child.
How was your day?
- Ask her.
Cottage-cheese...
- It's alright, I'll help myself.
Anand, the kids
holidays are approaching.
Let's decide where to go.
We'll need time for
tickets and hotel bookings.
Last minute everything
becomes very expensive.
Dad, can I suggest where
we should go? - Where?
See...
- Wow! Beautiful.
See...
It's really nice.
Where is this?
- Show me.
Close to Kufri.
- Wow.
Fine...let's plan once I am back.
Devki, please handle the bookings,
etc.
Sure.
- I've figured out everything, dad.
I'll tell you everything
when you're back.
How long will you be gone, dad?
- 10 days.
What do you want from New York?
Eiffel Tower.
The Eiffel Tower is in Paris.
Then go to Paris instead,
why are you going to New York.
By the way, dad,
you're looking quite handsome today.
What do you want?
Don't you know how
to take a compliment?
The last time I looked handsome...
...I had to buy her a
mobile phone worth 40,000.
So, what do you want?
There's a party on Saturday night.
All my friends are going.
Do you know about this?
Saturday is Valentine's Day, right?
- So?
No... nothing.
Where's the party?
Can <i>I</i> g0. Papa?
But where's the party?
Zodiac Farms,
it's not too far from here.
No, that's too far.
It is very far.
Who else is going?
- Like I said...all my friends.
Is Sapna going?
- Hmm.
And Rishi?
- Hmm.
Any more questions, ma'am?
Arya.
- What?
I am asking for your permission.
Fine, we'll think about it.
What's there to think?
Don't you trust me?
Of course dear, we trust you.
- Then?
Do you need mam's
approval for this too?
Arya, behave yourself!
Arya. Arya.
It's no ordinary event.
It's the hottest party in Delhi.
Kabir's coming as well.
You should propose to him.
- Have you lost your mind?
I mean...
Catch you later.
- Bye.
Dinner.
I spoke to your dad.
He's agreed.
You can go to the party.
What are you going to wear?
Never vent your anger on food.
Finish your dinner.
Goodnight, dear.
I don't feel like leaving
you guys and going.
What do you think?
Arya was right.
You're really looking
handsome nowadays.
Really?
What is it that you want?
- I see...
Just finish your conference
and come back soon.
I know... you always handle everything.
But... I'll try talking to Arya again.
She just can't share you with anyone.
Actually,
it's we who need to understand her.
Rajender, Look after the house.
Yes, sir.
- Dad.
What's the matter? You didn't
Whatsapp your shopping list yet.
Don't you want anything?
Dad...
I am sorry for last night.
I know I hurt you and ma'am.
When will you stop calling her that?
She's your mother.
You've forgotten my mother...
...but not me.
What I did for us was right.
I could've never raised
you without Devki.
She has accepted us.
She never differentiated
between you and Priya.
I have accepted Piyu.
It's always the mother
who's blessed with a daughter.
And not the other way around.
I can't do it, dad.
I can't let her down.
I miss her.
I really miss her.
- My child...
Go enjoy your party.
Papa.
Mr. Anand.
- Yeah.
What good is your laptop without this?
Oh my, God...
Where's my passport?
Your passport and tickets
are in the right zip.
Right zip.
What will I do without you?
Okay, bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
- Bye.
Come soon.
- I will.
Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Mina, see who's at the door.

Hello, madam.
Niranjana, what brings you here?
Hello, madam.
- Hello. Come in.
Sit.
Sit, Rohini.
We just started a new business...
Tie and Dye.
And to share this joy please
accept these sweets from our side.
This is amazing... very good.
None of this was possible without you.
You educated us...
Gave us respect.
And as a result,
we're independent now.
No-no...it's all because
of your hard work.
Is that your elder daughter
you always talk about?
Yes.
- I see...
How about some tea or juice? - No need
for formalities. We'll be leaving now.
See you on Thursday,
keep your assignments ready. - Yes.
Dear. Sweets?
What do you talk to them about me?
Nothing.
Just generally...
Nice things only.
I've no objection
to your social service.
But you don't have
to talk to anyone about me.
Didn't you tell them?
What?
That I am not your daughter, ma'am.

Where is Arya?
- What, Ma'am?
Where is Arya? - Don't know.
She was here a while ago.
I can't reach her.
It's been two hours
since she left for home...
Wasn't she with Sapna and Rishi?
Yes, ma'am. - Rishi, has no clue.
He doesn't know anything.
Come on let's dance. - And, Sapna,
she doesn't know anything.
I am really sorry, ma'am.
- We don't know.
Sorry, ma'am.
I told Rishi to take care of her.
Sir...
Sir...sir...l need your help.
- Yes.
My daughter hasn't reached home yet.
Please help me.
I am tensed...
- Get a glass of water for the lady.
My daughter was attending
a party at the farm house...
I'm trying her phone...
What's the name of your daughter...
...and which farmhouse did she go to?
Arya Sabarwal.
Zodiac Farm.
Yeah... what's the problem?
Her daughter's disappeared.
She hasn't disappeared...
She just hasn't returned home yet.
Take a seat, ma'am.
- Sir, I am very worried.
I've been trying to call her...
...but it's unavailable.
- Please.
Sit down and tell us everything.
What's the age of your daughter?
- 18 years.
Give us her phone number.
Sure?
Get to work and trace
this phone number.
Sir.
Please try.
- Have some water.
You shouldn't be worried.
It's Valentine's Day.
She must be out with her boyfriend.
There's no way she'll tell you.
What are you saying?
Ma'am, kids these
days are just like that.
Don't worry... She must
be enjoying herself somewhere.
We deal with such cases every day.
- Sir, please.
You might have dealt
with similar cases before.
But my daughter isn't
like any of them.
She called me at 12:30 and
said she's coming home in 45 minutes.
That clearly means
she was coming home!
Look at the time now.
It's been 3 hours.
She isn't at her friend's place...
...nor at the party,
nor is she answering her phone.
In fact, no one knows where she is.
Do you get what I am saying?
I need your help.
Write down your details in this
register. And your phone number.
As well as the description
of your daughter.
Give me your number,

It's my official card.
I've quite a reputation in Old Delhi.

Come with me.
This side""
Oh, God!
Arya.
Oh, God!
How did this happen?
Arya.
She's had severe internal injuries.
She is still in a state of shock.
And...we might have to do
multiple surgeries later on.
Because of internal bleeding..
She is unable to eat.
So we will be feeding
her through her Iv.
In fact...somebody tried
to strangle her to death.
Because of which her
breathing is inconsistent.
If she doesn't stabilize soon...
her condition can get critical.
To be honest with you, ma'am...
...your daughter has
been physically abused.
It's possible that your
daughter has been raped.
Ma'am...
She's a strong girl, ma'am.
Behind me is the very hospital...
...where the assault victim
was admitted a while ago.
Sources confirm that
she is in critical condition.
We'll update you as soon
as we've more information.
This is Pankaj Sharma with
cameraman Sahil, Zee News, Delhi.
Sir, boss is calling you.
What's the update
on Sansar Singh's case?
Charge sheet's been
already filed, sir.
The victim at JP Care Hospital
is no longer an assault case.
It's rape.
Possibly gang-rape-
Go and take over.
- Yes, sir.
Mrs. Sabarwal.
Ma'am, please sign here.
Thank you, ma'am.
Mrs. Sabarwal.
Matthew Francis, Crime Branch.
I'm...extremely sorry
about what has happened.
I want you to know that...
...we've started our investigations.
We're interrogating everyone
present at the party.
Also...we must record
your daughter's statement...
...whenever she regains consciousness.
I'm sure you understand.
Anand... please come back.
We really need you.
Please come back.
Please!

Dear...
What do you want, dear?
Water? Would you like some water?

Please, dear.
Just one spoon.
I am sorry""
Did she say anything?
Tell us something, dear.
Who were they?
We know...
...how hard this is for you.
But only you...
can bring them to justice.
If you can...
- Do you know...
Do you know what he was screaming?
""Now call your mom""
I don't remember anything after that.
Sir...
The girl has given her statement.
Get up.
Leave my collar
- Come.
What have I done?
- Let go.
Bro.
- Come quietly. - Leave me.
Where you are taking me?
Come on, You...
- Let go.
What have I done?
Where you are taking me?
Leave my collar.
You will pay for this, inspector.
You will...
Sir, let me go.
- Sir, where you are taking him?
I haven't done anything.
- Where are you taking him?
Sir...
- Sir...
Sir... Stop hitting him.
Sir...
I haven't done anything.
I haven't done anything.
- What has he done?
Let me go.
- Sir, let him go.
We know he's your friend.
Say it clearly.
- His name is Jagan Singh.
Don't die before I return.
Where are you taking my son?
- I'll be back soon.
Get up...
Where are you taking me?
- Come on.
Where are you taking me?
- Come on.
Open the door.
- Take care, Uncle. I'll be back soon.
Get in.
I said get in.
I could've done that myself, Tara.
Then you should've done it by now.
- Okay...
Can I get a cup of tea?
The weather's playing tricks again.
No tea for you!
I'll get it.
What is English for 'Tara'.
- Star.
She's got starry tantrums.
'The Valentine Day rape case...'
Go back...
...post the victim's statement.
This is the gang-rape incident case,
where the victim was...
Kidnapped from Zodiac Farms...
No one's safe in this country anymore.
She was found next morning in
critical condition in a drain.
The victim has identified four people
through video conferencing. - Tea.
The case is now under Crime Branch...
...which is being lead
by Officer Matthew Francis.
Nothing's ever going
to change in this country.
Why not, mom?
The government will have
to take an action for this.
The people need to wake up.
Listen...you must come
home early from your tuitions.
Mom?
- Don't you see what's happening?
What are you saying?
- What am I saying?
Why don't you say something?
It always has to be me.
- All four are still in custody.
The case has been
forwarded to Fast Track Court...
...and the victim has sought permission
to depose through video conference.
""...And when they thought
I am dead, they...""
""...threw me...
...out of their car.""
Sir, we seek permission
for their forensic test.
Granted.
Thank you, sir.
Arya's injuries are
consistent with her story.
I am completely sure
she's telling the truth.
And the rest can be proved...
...after we receive
the forensic report.
Everyone says that
we'll lose this case...
...as soon as the
forensic reports arrive.
Please do something.
This is Arya SabarwaPs
blood report...
...on the 14th of February.
Blood alcohol content is 0.08.
Her statement is not reliable.
I am at the court.
I'll call you back.
Sir, this is the victim's phone.
The police recovered
it from the exact same location...
...where she claimed
she was kidnapped.
'Sit here, I'll call a cab.'
Sir, I was at that
pany from 10 pm to 4 am.
Charles and Mohit were with me.
They never left.
In fact, she left the party.
These are their phone records.
The triangulated positions show...
...that Charles was at the party.
And Baburam never left his post.
And Mohit's teacher broke his phone.
So...
The traffic signal cameras...
- Sir, verification.
It's verified.
- Thank you, sir.
Sir, we've recovered
footages of the car...
between the
farmhouse and the drain.
It's Charles Deewan's car, which
the victim mentioned in her statement.
Sir...the car was completely washed.
No prints, no fluids.
You two go back to the party.
And you, back to your post.
I'll go wash the car.
- Okay.
I was driving the car.
I borrowed the car from dude...
I mean, from my friend Charles...
...since it was Valentines Day...
...and I wanted to take
my girlfriend for a ride.
Sir, his phone's location
proves that he was in the car.
With his girlfriend, of course.
I called the police
immediately after I found her.
But I thought it was better
to take her to the nearest hospital...
...instead of waiting for the police.
Note down...victim was found
where she claims she was thrown.
Before I left,
Mohit was misbehaving with Arya.
By the time I got back,
Sapna was quite dizzy...
...and Arya's phone was unreachable.
After that, I dropped Sapna home.
And finally,
Baburam has confessed to the police...
Objection. inadmissible.
Sustained. Don't waste my time.
Don't you think your friend
Arya left with her boyfriend?
They had sex.
They had an argument...
He beat her up.
- Objection! Character assassination.
But unfortunately in our society...
...we cannot openly admit to affairs.
- Objection, sir.
So she blamed it on someone else.
- Sustained.
Stop this rubbish!
Show some sensitivity.
Sorry, sir.
Did you see Mohit when
you arrived at the party?
Yes.
And Baburam even
opened the gate for you?
'I'm here to pick up my daughter.'
Say it louder.
Yes, but...
I got there at around 2 am.
But my daughter Arya
was missing since 12:30 am.
So you admit that
they were at the party...
...but your daughter wasn't.
Objection, leading the witness.
Denied.
What's all this nonsense in the court?
According to the
Supreme Court's maxim...
...the victim's statement
is enough for a conviction...
...even I know that.
But this maxim is based on the fact...
...that people can lie,
circumstances cannot.
Shall we, dear.
You've been discharged.
Shall we go home?
Arya and Devki ma'am
always had a problem with me.
So it's quite obvious
they took my name.
And why will I do it, sir?
I am in love with Arya.
If I had been there that day...
...I would've never spared those guys.
Will you please introduce yourself?
I am Dr. Mohit Bhatt.
I'm a Grade 1 Senior
Scientific Officer...
...at the Central Forensic Laboratory.
Did you prepare this report?
- I did.
What's written in it?
The report is negative.
The accused's forensic samples...
...and the samples collected
from Arya's body do not match.
How is this possible?
Arya gave her statement 3 days later.
The swabs were collected
after 72 hours.
The sperms were destroyed by then.
But don't worry, we'll apply again.
This time it will be positive.
It's really unfortunate
that the prosecutrix was raped.
She has sustained severe
wounds on her body.
And there was an attempt
to kill her as well.
Since she was under
the influence of alcohol...
...on the night of 14th February,
her statement cannot be relied on.
Even the Prosecution has
failed to corroborate her statement.
The court believes that...
...even if thousands
of guilty go free...
...not a single innocent
soul should be punished.
It cannot be proven without a doubt...
...that Charles Deewan,
Mohit Chadha, Baburam Pande...
...and Joginder Singh
committed the rape.
And so the court acquits them.
Jagan...
- Dude.
What an amazing lawyer.
Leave me.
Take him out of the court.
Arrest him! This is contempt of court.
- Shut up!
Anand, what happened?
- Devki, this is really unfair.
Where are you taking him?
Hold on...
- This is not justice.
Waitmwhere are you taking him?
Anand!
- Ma'am please...
Anand!
- Devki.
Wait madam, please.
Anand!
Thank you, sir.
The court acquitted everyone.
- I can't believe it.
Sir punched Jagan in a fit of rage...
...and he was arrested
for contempt of court.
But don't worry ma'am,
we'll get him out.
He's here.
Sir, sign here.
I am so sorry about what has happened?
I can understand what
you'll are going through.
There's no way you can understand.
You can get away with
rape in this country...
...but you can't even slap a rapist.
The Police never discriminates.
Anyone who breaks the law is our enemy.
- Please...
I've no more expectations.
Not from the Police...
...nor the law.
Yeah, lndu.
Please open the door.
- What happened?
Arya saw her verdict on
...and locked herself inside.
- What was everyone doing?
Why did you leave her alone?
- Open the door.
I couldn't do anything.
- Open the door.
Arya...
- Arya, please.
Arya...
Arya, please.
- Arya, open the door.
Arya!
- Oh, God!
Arya.
Calm down.
Arya.
Indu, take her away.
Mom.
Arya.
Calm down, dear.
Arya...
No, Arya.
Calm down.
Arya.
Arya.
Calm down, dear.
Arya...
Calm down, dear.
Calm down.
Calm down, dear.
Calm down.
Calm down, dear.
She's asleep.
We can't give up, Devki.
We must fight.
We'll appeal to the High Court.
They will be hanged to death.
They will pay for this.
Arya's the one paying the price.
Living with this incident...
Nothing can be worse than that.
I always believed...
...everything will be eventually
fine between Arya and me.
But now it's all over.
She has gone so far...
...and coming back is...
I've lost her.
I've lost her, Anand.
You awake, dear.
I've decided that...
...we should go out somewhere.
How about that place you suggested?
It's alright.
But do let me know...
...once you change your mind.
When will sis come back to school?
Soon.
Stop bothering me, Mohit.
Your brother just got back.
- Bye, morn.
How many months into
pregnancy you have been?
How can you allow him back in school?
- The court's acquitted him.
He's innocent by law.
So you're saying that
my daughter's lying?
That's not what I meant.
But I can't take
any action against him.
What excuse can I
give for expelling him?
""That the court didn't
believe Arya...""
""...but we do?""
So you won't do anything.
His parents will sue the school.
Morning, ma'am.
- Morning...
Stop calling me all the time.?
Tell brother I am coming...coming
towards him only.
I had to bunk lectures because of you.
Now hang up, stop bothering me.
A lawyer like Bansal will
definitely benefit our case.
Go for it.
I'll call you later.
Devki, what happened
to the car... - It's nothing.
Just a small accident.
Accident? Are you okay?
Yeah, I am fine.
No wonder you're so late.
Indu also had to leave.
- Anand...
I cannot teach at
that school any longer.
And we'll shift Priya
to another school.
What happened?
He's back in school.
Who?
Mohit?
I suggest you find someone else.
He's not a nice guy.
What are you saying, DK sir?
- Exactly.
I wonder if my daughter
will ever get married?
I know of a guy.
Fresh in the market.
He'll be absolutely
right for your daughter.
Look...
Tell me something, DK sir.
Are you a detective or a matchmaker?
Just your well-wisher, Mr. Bagga.
Wait here.
Where to?
- Just check his profile.
Madam, where are you going?
Come in.
I came here by mistake.
You're holding my visiting card...
...and you claim to
have come by mistake.
How can I be of service?
I know everything about your case.
The court didn't
just make a mistake...
They have sinned.
I can feel what you're feeling.
No one knows what I am feeling.
I may not be a good enough
detective to deduce feelings...
...but I am a father nevertheless.
I have a daughter...she's
the same age as your daughter.
Look at this, it's very beautiful.
Thankfully she's
taken after her mother.
I can imagine what you're feeling.
But don't worry, I am a professional.
Client secrecy is my top priority.
Swear on God.
'Up-
I want information.
Done.
You'll get the information.
But...
From this moment onwards,
I don't know you...
...and you don't know me.
Welcome to Rajiv Chowk Metro Station.
Please stand clear of the door.
Thank you.
Monday nights Baburam
gets off early from work.
Every Monday night...
...he sits at the same bar
and drinks till it shuts down.
I don't know whether what
I am doing is right or wrong.
It's wrong.
But doing nothing isn't right either.
If you've to choose
between wrong and not right...
...then what will you choose?
The address of the bar.
Is the information a 100 percent?
Have faith in God.
He'll fix everything.
God can't be everywhere, Mr. DK.
I know.
That's why he created Mothers.
It takes only one lifetime
to be born as a woman.
But only after one thousand
and eighteen rebirths...
...does one get the privilege
of being born as a man.
Drunkard
Rubbish!
What?
- You're talking rubbish.
You've lost your mind.
Get lost.
- "" Lipstick...""
""Your waist... looks voluptuous.""
""Your waist... looks voluptuous.""
Don't be shy.
Show me your face.
<i>Rama...
- Why are you screaming?</i>
Where were you the last three days?
Why didn't you come home?
I am asking you something.
Who were you sleeping with?
Are you going to answer me?
Where had you gone?
I want to know...
- Shut up!
Why did you come back?
I even called at your office.
You haven't even been
to work for last four days!
I had made up my mind
to go to the police.
Why marry me if this
is what you wanted to do?
Why are you screaming?
I can scream too, you know.
What are you smashing in there?
Is that all you can do?
It's my bad luck.
""She called you four times...""
""...but you didn't reply.""
""And also...""
'He was the same security
guard who was recently arrested...'
'...in connection
to a gang-rape case.'
Piyu!
- Coming, mom.
'Security Guard Baburam
was acquitted...'
'...from the Valentine Day rape case.'
'He was found dead in his house,
in castrated condition.'
'According to sources,
he was missing for four days...'
'...and he was last seen on
Monday night at Vishwakarma bar.'
Some neighbors saw him
lying outside his house...
This is definitely revenge.
No, sir. They are decent people.
Really?
- Yes sir.
How can I help you?
You must have heard
what happened with Baburam.
He deserved whatever happened to him.
The problem is, Mr. Anand,
that this is no coincidence...
it was deliberate.
The question is who...
- I wish it was me.
My deputy Rashid, even he
believes this is revenge-killing.
But I said...it can't be you.
You're decent people.
Decent... but not stupid.
You're suspecting me?
You think I did it?
I think a man's capable
of doing anything when he's angry.
Yes...l am angry.
But I still have faith.
That we will get justice.
Nice to hear that.
See you...
Sorry for bothering you.
Keep an eye on him.
- Yes sir.
This is his new series.
It's an interesting take.
We're in a gallery,
Take off your sunglasses.
People will laugh at you.
I never leave home without
my mother's blessings...
...and my sunglasses.
Did you get the information
I asked for?
This must belong to an elephant.
It's a pen-drive.
I've already Whatsapped
you the procedure...
...for disabling CCTV.
You can go through it later.
Leave five minutes after I do.
Stay here for a while
and appreciate this painting.
What is this painting about?
It's when Draupadi washed
her tresses with Dushashan's blood.
Look around you.
This artist's theme is 'Mahabharata'.
The oldest revenge story.
Where is Draupadi?
It's modern art.
""Come out of this painting...'
I could've made this painting...
...with my hands tied behind my back.
Unbelievable.
If you get it, it's art.
If you don't, it's modern art.
Excuse me.
- Yes, sir. How can I help you?
How much for this red canvas?
5 million.
5...million?
- Yes, sir. It's already sold out.
Did you receive payment?
- Yes.
Draupadi.
'Charles Diwan.'
'The only son of an Indian
father and British mother.'
'His parents are no more...'
'...but they left everything for him.'
He live all alone in Greater Noida...
...Green Field society, bungalow 11
He's a partner in a nightclub.
'And every Saturday night
he parties at that club.'
'Even his servant takes
an off on Saturday night...'
'...and, returns on Sunday morning.'
'And his cousin,
Mohit Chadha, pet name Bunty.'
'Both his parents are pilots,
and they often travel.'
'So he spends most of his
time with his cousin Charles.'
'Both of them are very
frequent in each other's home.'
'By the way, Charles always has a
spare key to Mohit's house in his home.'
'Charles Diwan is a fitness freak.'
'From whey protein to creatine,
he takes every supplement.'
'Let me know if there's
any other information you want.'
'Well then...'
-okay-'
So what's the problem?
Can't you get a single
date for an appeal?
I don't think you're interested
in this case any longer.
Hold on.
Where are you going?
- We're out of groceries.
I'll be late.
Also, need to see the tailor...
I don't care if there
are other cases pending.
Now don't give me excuses, please.
He's still at home.
Do not lose sight of him, Rashid.
No chance, sir.
I haven't gone home
for 3 days myself.
I think he's very decent.
It's been <i>6</i> days.
Home to office,
Office to home...that's all he does.
He never even jumps a signal,
even at night.
He's a law abiding citizen.
- I asked you to keep an eye...
...and not for your opinion.
- Sorry sir.
Can you open it?
- Yes, madam.
The gardener...
I've told him a thousand
times not to leave it here.
The children can trip over.
It's open.
Come on...come on...
- Here you go.
The children will be home soon.
Keep this money.
Let's go...let's go..
It's okay, madam.
Here you go, mister.
Thank you.
Sir.
Hello?
Who is this?
What happened to bro?
Huh!
Which hospital?
Where to madam?
Hello...
yes, I'm just downstairs.
Coming UP-
Where are you going, madam?
Yes...
What?
- Who do you want to meet?
Mukesh Chabbra, 20-C.
I see...
- I'm coming.
Madam, your name?
- Mrs. Mathur.
Fine, go.
- Thank you.
What's wrong with him?
It's a case of poisoning, sir.
I never took my eyes off him, sir.
What's the poison?
It's cyanide, sir.
Made from apple seeds.
- Apple seeds?
Wait!
Reports say that Apple
seeds contain cyanide.
It only takes 1.5 g to kill a human.
And apple seeds contain 0.6 mg
At the moment he's paralyzed.
But the doctors are astonished
about how he survived?
Wait.
We've found traces of
protein shake and apple seeds...
...from his mouth and food pipe.
Bro.
- Is that what he ate last?
Yes, sir, that's what he ate.
And we've also collected
evidence from his home.
Who did this to you, bro?
And...
- It's not the father.
I think someone else is involved.
I want to know.
He cannot speak.
N ow!
Hello.
Yeah.
What? Fire?
You should've checked first.
- Even I heard the alarm, sir.
Look the police are here.
What's wrong?
- It was a false alarm, sir.
We checked the entire building.
There's no fire anywhere.
That was a close shave, mister.
Mom and dad would've killed me.
You can go. There's no fire, sir.
We'll put it out
even if there isn't one.
Let's go upstairs.
Rashid.
- Yes, sir.
Find out...what set off the alarm.
- Okay, sir.
Check everything.
Bedroom and kitchen too
You wasted your time once before...
...and you're doing it again.
What do you think
you're looking for, sir?
I said it's a false alarm.
Are you looking for buried treasure?
Go find the one who poisoned
my brother... - Shut up!
Otherwise,
I'll throw you out of the window.
It's just the bathroom.
Nature calls the police too.
So this is what was going on here.
Search properly, Rashid.
I want all his drugs in front of me.
Sir, this isn't mine.
My dad sometimes...
Sir, look.
- Sorry sir.
Honestly, sir, this isn't mine.
Where did it come from?
This is where the
cyanide was prepared.
Cooked enough to kill an elephant.
What are you saying?
Where were you last night?
At home, sir.
Isn't this your laptop?
Look at this, sir.
Jesus Christ.
He researched last night.
- Yes.
Son of a gun...it's been ages
since we had such a solid case.
Take all this into evidence.
- Yes, sir.
Arrest the bas***
Come on.
Hold on... wait...
What for?
Attempt to Murder.
He's my brother.
Why would I murder him?
Maybe you were scared...
...that one of you might
turn approver. Come on.
Please.
- Come on.
You know I haven't done anything.
- Come on!
Arya.
Arya dear, are you okay?
Dear...
Sorry.
He was my best student.
How did this happen, Charles?
How did it happen?
What happened to my
daughter that night...
happens every night.
After today, even you will never
forget that night.
You will think about
that night every day...
And regret it.
What were you guys
screaming that night?
""CALL YOU R MOM?""
Here's her mom.
What happened to him?
Poor boy got emotional seeing me.
- What happened? Are you okay?
See you.
Get well soon, Charles.
Yes, the meeting's on schedule.
Of course, of course.
Vinay, please be there on time.
I'm sitting in the car.
15 minutes.
Bye, mom.
- Bye.
Hello, Mrs. Devki. How are you?
What brings you here, at the school?
Is everything okay?
Of course.
I just came to see you.
What do you want?
I need your signature.
What for?
Well...the forensic lab wants
to dispose off Arya's samples.
If you want to get them
examined by your own doctors...
Then this is your last chance.
Dispose them.
L...need you to sign this.
Sure.
Sorry.
<i>Just one second.</i>
Are you...looking for this?
Do you...
...wear the same kind of glasses?
No...
I can see everything clearly.
Here... your pen.
The fourth guy, Jagan Singh.
He's Criminal class.
He's dangerous.
If I had two daughters...
...I would've never gone after him.
Why are you telling me?
Because he's the only one left.
Believe it or not, but when
the court acquits guilty people...
...it makes me really angry.
I believe you.
Then believe this too.
When someone does my work for me...
...that makes me very angry too.
I must go...l am getting late.
- You can go, Mrs. Devki.
But the moment I find evidence,
I will take you along.
Excuse me.
What's wrong?
You can't believe it either, right?
Charles can die anytime...
...and then Mohit will
be charged with murder.
Does Arya know?
I don't know.
But she told me that
she wants to go for a holiday.
That's really great.
Read the whole thing.
Lots of work to do.
Bookings are to be done.
I'll get to work, okay.
Anand.
- Yeah.
There's something I want to share...
- You are worried about Arya?
She's recovering.
Everything's getting back to normal.
We're going to have the
best family vacation ever.
I am so excited, so happy.
But l...
This is a new beginning.
It's what we've been waiting for.
""In this world...""
""...people...get deceived.""
You sing really well.
I always wanted to
be a singer like my mother.
Was she a singer too?
- No
She also wanted to be one.
Let's get to the point.
It'll take some time.
Jagan is missing.
I even visited his hometown.
His father passed away,
but he didn't show up.
The police are getting suspicious.
Please hurry up.
By the time you return
from your vacations...
...you'll have all
the details about Jagan.
With the grace of God,
everything will be fine.
I have my resources.
Mr. DK.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hail Bhole...
I've resources... setting.
Hail Bhole...
- Hail Bhole...
Do you know who I am?
Who doesn't know you, sir?
How about a cup of tea?
No, sir. I've acidity.
Acidity?
The tea served in my
station is quite sweet.
I've also got high sugar.
Really?
- Yes, sir.
Then how about some black coffee?
Then...let's have some tea only.
That's more like it.
What are you two planning?
Who, sir?
Speak up.
What was your plan?
Because what you're
doing is not the solution.
I'm saying this for your own good.
What were you telling Devki?
Devki who?
I don't know any Devki, sir.
Swear on Almighty.
Rashid, get the stick.
Stick?
- Sir.
What for?
What have I done to deserve a stick?
<i>Who is this, Mathew'?</i>
Rathore sir!
Myself Daya Shankar Kapoor...
...but, you can call me DK in short.
I am the best detective
in Dariyaganj area.
Enlighten him.
Sir, we're investigating
the gang-rape case.
How is he connected?
I've seen him with Mrs. Devki.
These two are definitely
planning something... - Devki?
The victim's mother?
Yes, sir.
Come out for a minute.
Forgive me, Lord.
It can't be anyone else, sir.
What proof do you have?
I don't have any goddamn proof.
If the word gets out to the media...
...then we'll be facing
harassment charges.
I'll be retiring soon.
I don't want any
kind of stress, Mathew
Sir, I just need a few days.
Let him go... and report to my cabin.
I've more important case for you.
Forget him.
- You say.
Will you do it.
- Yes, I will.
I've people on the outside.
""This moon and the moonlit night.""
""Listen to my heart's tale.""
Mohit, visiting time.
S*** you just ruined all my fun.
Hey handsome, come soon.
I am waiting for you.
He'll have to pay up at any cost.
I go there every day,
but he doesn't pay up.
Have the other guys paid up?
- Not yet.
Jaga"". you?
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
Why are you walking like that?
What?
- It's nothing.
Sorry.
Jagan, please get me out of here.
Find out who's behind all this.
- Shut up!
First, you poisoned Charles...
...and now you're begging me for help.
Why would I poison him
when everything was going fine?
He is my brother.
I never even sliced
an apple in my life...
...how can I make cyanide?
Think about it.
I've given this some deep thought.
Someone's trapping all of us.
And you're next.
Where are you going?
Jagan...
Jagan, please get me out of here.
JaQan!
Get me out of here, please.
- Let go.
Jagan.
Dude, I don't know what to say.
Whoever did this...won't survive.
Can you give me any hint?
Mo...
- What?
What?
Mo...
Mo...
Mo... Mohit?
Mohit can never do this.
That dimwit...
He's only good for taking
a puff and passing out.
I just met him.
He was in pain.
Yes, tell me something.
Mo...
Mo? Mo...Mother promise,
I will sc*** him.
At least tell me his name.
Who is it?
Huh?
Mom?
Mom?
Whose mom?

""Call your mom.""
The girl's mother.
She did all this?
Yes, dude? dude?

And how did you get in?
Where is Mr. Sabarwal?
He's out of town.
But who are you?
Friend.

Actually, dear,
I was busy all night.
Yes, Sorry-sorry...
Yes, we'll have lunch together.
Ask your mom to make
some salad as well.
Okay, dear.

Pick up the phone, Devki.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
- Hurry up, mom.
Sis and Papa are waiting,

Hello.
So, Mr. Bond, I've been observing
from the teacher's house.
You've been making a number of calls.
Who are you? What do you want?
School teacher.
School teacher?
Then go look in a school instead.
This is my office.
Where I come from...
...no one gets a second chance.
I don't care where you come
from or where you go.
We'll soon find out.
Now do you know!
What's the password, uncle?
Give me your thumb.
You're invading my personal documents.
I'll have you arrested
under section 378. - Quiet.
I won't stay quiet...remember that.
Hello, Johnson Cottage.
Can I speak to Mrs. Devki?
<i>They went sight-seeing.</i>
Thank you.
Johnson Cottage...
...that's where she is.
Now that you know, take my advice.
Surrender yourself.
I am not the kind of man
that gets intimidated by a woman.
Man? You think you're a man.
Men don't rape, you swine.
Not swine... Dinoswine.
Di noswi ne
You idiot, it's not dinoswine.
It's a dinosaur.
You're going to die by
the hands of that teacher.
You should learn some
English before you die.

What are you doing, Devki?
Drop the gun.
How dare he touch my daughter?
I'm telling you...drop the gun.
How dare he touch my daughter?
How dare he?
I've evidence, Devki.
I swear he'll be brought to justice.
But if you shoot...
...I swear, you'll go to jail as well.
How dare he touch my daughter!
Think about your family, Devki.
I'm just coming from the cottage,
Anand is alive.
The police are taking
him to the hospital.
Priya's with him.
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!
It will happen again...

If you want to kill him...

What are you doing, you bas***
This is illegal.
I am telling you...shoot him!
I surrender.
I surrender.
Please.
She...poisoned my best friend.
She framed Mohit.

shoot him.
No-no-no, please, madam.
Please...
I was scared.
Don't listen to his bulls***.
Shoot him.
I can turn over a new leaf.
It's now or never.
Just one chance...
Give me one chance.
I surrender.

I'll become a better man!
Pull the damn trigger!

Sooraj Singh Chaudhary is a stern patriarch from a respected Jat family in Haryana. On his elder daughter Renu's wedding night, she elopes with her boyfriend, Rakesh. Determined to retrieve her, Chaudhary mobilizes his men to track down the couple. They capture two of Rakesh's friends and force them to reveal Bablu's name, suspecting he knows the couple's whereabouts. When Chaudhary's brothers Bhuppi, Pappi, and Sukhi confront Bablu, he overpowers them but is eventually subdued. Bablu and his friends are held captive and interrogated but insist they know nothing. Meanwhile, Bablu confides in his friends about his love for a girl whose earring he found but does not know her identity. The group attempts to escape but is recaptured when Bablu is distracted by catching sight of the girl.

Dimpy, Chaudhary's younger daughter and Renu's sister, discovers Renu's love letters. Fearing exposure, Dimpy tries to protect her sister's secret but inadvertently involves Bablu and his friends. Using the letters, Bablu blackmails Dimpy into helping him find the girl he loves. Dimpy reluctantly agrees and later learns that she is the girl Bablu has been searching for when he gives her earring to her, but Dimpy stays silent.

During a trip to town with Chaudhary's men in search of Renu and Rakesh, Bablu helps them flee to Shimla. However, their escape is uncovered by Pappi when he accidentally overhears Dimpy, and Bablu and his friends are severely beaten and Bablu sees Dimpy, which she recognizes him and reveals that Bablu knows where Renu and Rakesh are. Under pressure and getting beaten, Bablu falsely claims the couple is in Delhi. The group, including Dimpy, travels to Delhi, where Dimpy is kidnapped but rescued by Bablu, earning Chaudhary's grudging trust. Dimpy realizes her feelings for Bablu but hesitates to confess. Chaudhary eventually locates Renu and Rakesh on a bus. Defying her father, Renu reveals her pregnancy to Chaudhary, who upon being shocked, spares their lives but disowns Renu. The family returns home, and Chaudhary arranges Dimpy's marriage to Rajjo, a wealthy suitor. Heartbroken, Bablu decides to leave but soon returns, determined to win Dimpy. Chaudhary, fearing another elopement, keeps a close watch on Bablu. Bablu tells him that he understands how Chaudhary felt when Renu ran away from home and promises he will not elope with Dimpy.

When Bablu and his friends are about to leave, Rajjo enters at this juncture and beats up Bablu, however, Bablu fights back and defeats Rajjo when Rajjo insults him and Dimpy. However, they are stopped at the last moment by Chaudhary, who, realizing that Dimpy will only be happy if she gets to be with Bablu, tells Bablu to take Dimpy away. Bablu and Dimpy unite with a hug, Chaudhary and the other Jat community people agree to permit inter-caste and love marriages, and Chaudhary accepts Renu back as his daughter. The movie ends on a happy note.",2937,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt3142232.srt","Official YIFY movies site:

When is he going

It will. It will.

Bachelors find their destiny
in the lane of love.
Son, this is Hekri village.
The Jat Land.
Here, love happens
after marriage.
We ask our wife's name
after having two kids.
Get lost.
Uncle, start with
our traditional rituals.
And that would be Pappi Jat.
DLF's famous goon.
That's Mr. Chaudhary's
younger brother.
The bride's first uncle.
But I read in the papers
he's supposed to be behind bars.
Technically, he's still in jail.
Who's he?
We've called him from Mumbai
to shoot the wedding video.
He filmed three movies
with Chunky Pandey.
Suspenders!
Wonderful!
Shoot a nice video.
Please book my plane ticket.
Economy will do.
And that's the famous
encounter specialist...
...Bhupender Singh Chaudhary
AKA Bhuppi Blackberry.
The bride's second uncle.
He has committed
42 murders to date.
And If I hadn't been suspended...
...I would've completed
my half century.
Get me suspended.
Get me a train ticket.
Bhuppi.
He belongs to the brick mafia.
Rajjo Fauji.
-Rajjo.
-Pappi!
So they all serve in the army?
No, they have their own army.
They supply bouncers to all
the discos of Delhi and Haryana.
And if any owner doesn't agree...
...Pappi and Bhuppi
raid that place.
Disco closed.
I'll take a bus.
Just tell me the number, I'll go.
-Tenne.
-Yes?
Sir.
Tenne?
-Sir.
-What about the booze?
As usual.
Grandpa, you're the eldest in the family.
You start.
Sukhi, he's my son-in-law.
How can I drink before him?
-So? Why aren't you drinking?
-No one respects me.
-What's wrong, brother-in-law?
-What happened?
What's this?
-I don't drink this.
-Then what do you want?
Get me Black Dog.
A beauty spot
On your fair cheeks
A beauty spot

Listen, dear.
Better change your shirt.
The guests are about to arrive.
I am wearing a shirt. Get lost.
If he was not
our sister's husband...
...I would've killed him.
Drink up, brother-in-law.
Have this before the Black Dog.
-You'll love it. Have it.
-Come on.
Fine. At least, say cheers first.
Say cheers.
Say cheers.
Cheers.
Mr. Chaudhary is coming.
Mr. Chaudhary is coming.
Hide it quickly.
It was a mistake, son.
It won't happen again.
Mr. Chaudhary.
-Mr. Chaudhary. Focus on him.
-Hello.
-Greetings.
-Bless you.
-Is everything okay?
-Yes, everything is okay.
Why is everyone
calling him ""Bapu""?
They are all orphans.
Mr. Chaudhary
pays for their education...
...and provides for their family.
Isn't he a generous man?
Actually, Mr. Chaudhary
killed their fathers.
What is this family?
Mukesh.
Wasn't there a bicycle
parked outside the main gate?
You know, Renu...
...the first time your mom
stepped in this house...
...she looked as beautiful as you.
Where's Dimpy?
Dimpy has donned Renu's jewelry
and has gone snap-happy.
Dimpy is thoroughly
enjoying Renu's wedding.
Go and call her.
Renu.
Brother, you're too much.
You can't stand her leaving,
can you?
You love her too much.
People from 36 villages
draw inspiration from you.
Why are you scared
of sending her away?
Renu, my dear.
Seek your dad's blessings.
What happened?
Don't be scared.
I have chosen you a fine suitor
after careful thought.
They are a reputed family.
You'll be showered with love...
...and soon you'll even forget
your father.
The wedding procession is here.
Time for the rituals.
Go on.
Get ready.
Close it!
Get lost!
Show her face!
Didn't you hear me?
Let's throw him in the fire.
How dare a teacher's son
elope with our daughter!
I didn't know Rakesh
would do such a thing.
If I had a clue...
...I would've killed him.
Get up.
Who is he?
Rakesh's friend.
Three years ago,
they studied together in Delhi.
-Come on!
-Whenever someone elopes...
...their friends definitely know.
-Who are you?
-What's going on?
-Hello! Who are you?
-Are you Jitesh?
Yes.
Bang, bang
Hi, I am Karan.
You must have heard my name.
I am an actor.
Bang, bang
Two serials, a few films.
Whoa, I quite like this music.
Nice club, huh?
What the--
Tell me, where is Rakesh?
-We don't know anything. Please.
-Tell the truth.
I beg you. Please hear me out.
Sir, please don't hit me.
Tell me, where is Rakesh?
-Speak up! We'll beat you.
-Please!
Tell us.
Tell me, where is Rakesh?
Speak up.
We don't know anything. Bablu....
Bablu knows.
Bablu knows.
Hold on.
Sir, please ask Bablu.
They said his name
so many times. Who is he?
That boy seems clever.
He's very cunning.
We sent our boys after him.
But he is never at home.
-Pick him up.
-Yes, brother.
Sukhi!
Get the cars.
Take a few more people along.
What did you say?
I said take a few more along.
Take a few more people along.
Is Bablu Superman?
No, he's an entire army.
Are you Bablu?
You didn't have to corner me
to ask that.
-Where can we find Rakesh?
-Which Rakesh?
Rakesh Gupta? Rakesh Tiwari?
Rakesh Roshan?
Which Rakesh?
The one who studied with you.
He eloped with our niece.
What are you saying?
Rakesh!
Rakesh eloped!
That calls for a celebration.
I must tell everyone about it.
Listen up.
This is Blackberry.
It doesn't miss.
It connects directly.
Don't push.
Mister, why use your hands
when we can talk?
Why? What will you do?
Will you hit us?
Hit us? Hit--!
I didn't think about it...
...but now I must.
So you want to be a hero?
Can't help it.
Others don't have it.
And I can't lose it.
Just tell us, lover boy.
Or else we'll waste you.
Fine.
Okay. I'll tell you.
Choose one.
Hold on. No one interferes.
I'll choose.
-I'll choose.
-Please.
Tenne, hurry up.
This one.
Where are you hiding those two?
Who hit me from behind?
Tell us, where's our daughter?
First, tell me
who hit me from behind.
Tell us.
Where's our daughter?
-Tell us where she is.
-Quiet!
Speak one by one. Or forget it.
Listen.
Your daughter ran away
from home, didn't she?
She didn't run away
to become a sprinter.
I'm sure she ran away
with the boy she loved.
She must've eloped.
She wouldn't have eloped...
...if you would've allowed her
to choose her groom.
He was showing
the same attitude back there.
I hit you in the head
from behind.
But here, I will knock your head off.
Enough.
Come on.
Give me Rakesh's address.
You want Rakesh's address.
Okay.
Let's do this.
Whenever he calls,
I'll ask him and let you know.
Give me your cell number.
What's wrong?
You don't have a phone.
Okay. I'll send a letter to you.
I'll leave now. Goodbye.
Wait!
Get one thing straight.
Until I find my daughter...
...you will stay here.
Get in.
Close the door.
Bablu.
Bablu.
You too?
With friends like you,
who needs enemies?
Who gave them my name?
He did.
He did.
Come on.
Bablu.
What happened?
Thank God you're here. Save us.
Don't be scared.
I am here now.
I won't let anything
happen to you, okay?
They ruined my face.
If you only get in touch
through Facebook...
...that's what's going to
happen to you.
-Darn it.
-You think this is funny?
-Darn you.
-Bablu.
Rascal!
We're in such a tough situation
and you're thinking about a reunion.
-Darn you.
-Let go!
Excuse me.
Can I join in too?
-Who are you?
-I am Kiki.
I live in London.
I came to India
for the first time.
I just asked these Jats for a ride...
...but they beat me up.
They brought me here.
It's all because of
his red trousers.
A shaman told the Jats
to find a man...
...wearing red trousers in the north...
...and that he might know
Rakesh's address.
Forget it.
-Kiki.
-Yeah?
-Do you know where Rakesh is?
-I don't know any Rakesh.
-How would he know?
-Yeah!
-We thought you did.
-I don't know.
-What?
-Darn it!
We are in big trouble.
I said so!
Back in college, I warned you
that he's a big flirt.
Fine, let's just
sit around here.
Listen. Listen.
You have to find a way out.
Please get us out of here.
-Yeah, please.
-Then choose one.
-Enough of you.
-Bablu, I've had enough.
May I choose?
No....
This one.
Good.
-Tomorrow, let's party at DU.
-He is at it again.
Like old times.
The same attitude again.
You know it, don't you?
Others don't have it.
-And you can't lose it.
-And you can't lose it.
-We know. We know.
-We know. We know.
But you don't know...
...that your hero
has found his heroine.
She was a moon-like beauty
But she was annoyed
She was a broken dream
And she was all yours
Somebody fulfilled
My shattered hopes
We met but you soon went away
Life seems dull
Without you
Without you
Who is she?
-What's her name?
-Where does she live?
That's all I don't know.
Everything else is all set.
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Darn it!
We were planning
to run away from here.
So, what is the position?
Simple.
There is a railway station
just outside this village.
We'll sneak out of here
tomorrow morning.
Next we get on a train.
We disappear and I'll tell you
the rest of the plan on the train.
-Listen.
-Yes?
Any plans on coming back here?
Are you crazy?
Why would we come back?
Some unfinished business.
Bablu, stop.
Who is it?
-You baldy!
-Darn it!
-Take this.
-Save me!
Move quickly!
Who hit me?
I won't spare you.
Who are you?
A drop of satiety's enough
To set my heart on fire
I missed you every moment
Somebody fulfilled
My shattered hopes
We met but you soon went away
Without you, life seems dull
Life seems dull
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Hurry! The train is here.
-Where is Bablu?
-I don't know.
-He was right behind me.
-Bablu!
-Where is Bablu?
-Bablu!
The train is leaving!
Someone stop it!
-Come on, Bablu!
-The train is leaving!
-Bablu!
-Bablu!
The train has left!
Bablu, the train is leaving.
-What is he doing?
-Oh, no!
Bablu! Bablu, come here!
-Bablu, hurry!
-The train....
-The train is leaving!
-Bablu!
-Bablu!
-Bablu, hurry!
-Hurry up! We'll miss the train.
-Please hurry!
Come on! Hurry up!
Oh, no! Gosh!
Get in the line.
Bhuppi, these are the fools
that escaped.
Fatso.
Scoundrel.
You....
Don't you dare touch anyone!
So you're the hero.
I'll burn you in the furnace.
No one will know
where you disappeared.
Rajjo, enough!
You're a big-time ruffian,
aren't you?
You were supposed to
watch over them, weren't you?
Am I right?
How did they escape?
These boys will die
sooner or later.
But I might end up killing you.
Darn it.
Don't ever think
of running away again.
Don't worry.
We won't leave
till you find the girl.
He has an attitude.
Let's see.
Enough of your big attitude.
Why did you stop?
I didn't stop. She stopped me.
-Who?
-That girl.
She lives in this village.
Bablu, this is the Jat Land.
It's forbidden to even think about
their girls.
I can find you one
if you come to London.
Now that I've met her...
...I don't need to meet
anyone else.
Have you lost your mind?
Maybe.
I don't know.
It feels like
everything has stopped.
You mean constipation?
-Will you shut up?
-Okay, okay. I'll shut up.
But what is the position now?
First, we must find out
who the girl is.
No.
This news shouldn't be out
in the newspapers.
Bless you, dear.
May you be successful
in your efforts today.
The teacher has relatives, right?
Keep an eye on them. Wait.
There was a shootout!
A few died on the spot.
It was fun.
Where is Daddy's
dearest girl going?
College.
To submit
my home science project.
Your sister submitted many
such home science projects.
Aren't you ashamed?
Your sister ran away
and you're going to college.
What nonsense!
Renu's the one who ran away.
Shut up!
Wild one. Go inside.
And no more college.
-Home science.
-No college....
Renu ran away and they stop me
from going to college.
Dimpy.
Listen to me.
Stop going to college.
Learn cooking.
Brother Rajjo,
don't you have a home?
-You always hang around here.
-Listen....
Don't call me brother.
Soon we'll be related
in a different way.
How's that?
Are you making me your mother?
I will make you
mother of my kids.
Dad, they stopped me
from going to college.
Everyone suspects...
...that I will run away like Renu.
No, my dear.
I trust you.
Renu wouldn't have eloped.
That boy misled her.
He seduced her.
How can my daughter elope?
Do you remember?
As little girls...
...both of you used to play
with my mustache.
I'd trim my mustache down...
...and you'd turn it up.
You couldn't stand to see
your father's mustache down.
I wish...
...my daughter had not eloped.
Dad, I'll never do
what Renu did.
Do you trust me?
So please let me
go to college.
What?
-Let's talk later.
-Dad, please....
Okay, Dad.
Go.
Yes, you were saying something.
Our custom says those
who indulge in love marriage...
...will be killed
by their own family.
My daughter didn't run away!
She was misled.
And if she has eloped willingly...
...I'll burn her alive.
You don't help me.
My uncles and aunts...
...had their fun
when it was their time.
But when it's my time,
they declared an emergency.
-Why?
-Why?
Don't you have fun secretly?
What do I do?
I just lie to go to college.
I don't lie
to go around with boys.
Exactly. Don't you want to?
I don't have time
for such nonsense.
I have two years for myself.
To enjoy my freedom.
I have to finish my education
and learn dancing.
I want to become Miss Haryana...
...and then marry
whoever my dad chooses...
...and have a kid every year.
If I stop going to college...
...my two-year plan will be ruined.
I hope Renu gets caught...
...and her husband leaves her
on the night of their honeymoon.
I hope she comes back crying.
She is a witch.
She ran away
and left me in a coop.
I can't go to college.
You can go to college
only after Renu is caught.
Those boys know where Renu is
and they will never tell us.
Of course, they will.
I'll deal with them.
So, what is the position?
Good.
There are just 300 houses
in the village.
Finding the girl
won't be difficult.
There's a crematorium as well.
Your cremation won't be difficult.
Excuse me.
Hello, listen.
-English in Jat Land?
-Excuse me.
A girl?
Although I never entertain boys...
...now I have no option.
Just tell me where my sister is.
I'm not talking
to your thin waist.
-Show me your face.
-You....
Please tell me.
I won't tell anyone. Honestly!
Okay, listen.
Yes? Tell me.
Your sister....
Okay.
And her boyfriend.
Okay.
The place
they are hiding is....
-We don't know.
-Gosh.
-You think you're a hero?
-I don't say that, but they do.
I can't stop everyone
from talking.
My entire family is in trouble
because of you.
Not because of me,
blame your father.
Don't you dare insult my father.
There isn't
a better man than him.
I see.
Why did your sister leave him?
Even if I tell you...
...you know what will happen
to them when they are caught.
So?
They ruined the family name,
so they'll be punished.
If they are wrong,
then who's right?
Me and my dad.
There's one more.
-Who?
-Me.
Then we should help each other.
I mean, both of us
are in trouble because of Renu.
Right?
-Then do one thing.
-Hold on. Please.
-Let me speak to her.
-Let him speak.
-Let's help each other. Tell me.
-Bablu.
Okay, I'll find your sister.
Okay.
-And you find that girl.
-Girl? Which girl?
He's in love with a girl
from your village.
Love?
Not yet.
But it could be true.
Who knows?
How dare you!
You want other families to be
ruined like ours.
Their families will even stop girls
from attending college.
-She is a radio.
-You're done for!
-You're a goner. I'll tell my dad.
-Fine.
-Go away.
-We'll deal with you.
-Stop!
-Hey, she is going.
It's not true.
You'll get us killed.
Paste this photo
on your chest
He's been here for just two days,
and already in love.
And look at his audacity.
He's asking for my help.
I felt like kicking him.
What are you doing?
Why did you fall on me?
-You kicked me.
-What's this?
-""My love, Renu.""
-Love letter?
""My lips found yours....""
""Kiss.""
""Love.""
""Two bodies, one soul!""
Oh, my!
""Yours, Rakesh!""
Why did she hide it here?
Gather this quickly.
Someone might walk in.
Switch off the fan.
They're scattering everywhere.
Darn it.
Oh, no! We're done for!
This is serious.
Uncle Bhuppi found the letter.
Hide them!
They even kissed each other.
""Touch me! Touch me! Touch me!""
""Kiss me!""
Now isn't the time to enjoy them.
Hide them quickly.
Quickly.
What are you doing?
Where's Dimpy?
She must be in her room.
Why? What happened?
Here. Throw them away.
No. Burn them. Burn them.
-Who, me?
-No, me. Go quickly.
-Dimpy.
-Oh, no.
What's this?
-What?
-Your sister's love letter.
I see.
So that's how they look.
I never saw one.
Wait.
What's in that?
Nothing.
-Tenne.
-Sir.
-Check what's in the basket.
-Okay, sir.
What's in the basket?
-Nothing.
-Nothing?
It's nothing, just rubbish.
If I find out someone else
was involved...
...I'll shoot them.
This is amazing.
Love letters in the age
of mobile phones.
-How romantic!
-Show us.
Did you see that?
Rakesh was really desperate.
-Time to show off!
-Forget it.
Kiki, we can get out of here.
See these letters?
Watch how I act.
Call Suraj Singh Chaudhary.
Quiet!
Call your father.
These letters clearly indicate...
...that you played a role
in your sister's love story.
Now we'll teach you a lesson.
We'll tell you....
You will do
whatever we say.
-Listen to me. Please--
-We don't want to see all that.
God!
Look....
Don't try to blackmail me.
I haven't thought about it yet...
...but I'll blackmail you now.
But I had no clue
about Renu's affair.
But it's clearly written
in these letters...
...that you watched
English movies with them.
Sometimes.
You were given your sister's
pocket money to keep quiet.
Sometimes.
But I didn't know
she would run away.
I see.
Honestly, I didn't know.
So you're saying...
...that falling in love is right...
...but love marriage is a sin.
I get it now.
Whatever tarnishes family honor
is a sin. Idiot!
So why did you help Renu
run away?
That's not in the letters.
That's not in the letters.
But what if I write it?
What nonsense!
God! You're such a rascal!
Liar, blackmailer!
But it's true...
...that you got a secret tattoo
on your body.
You also took modeling classes...
...to become Miss Haryana.
You also took salsa classes.
You were saying something?
Girl, village....
Can't we make a deal?
-What's the offer?
-Wait. Write it down.
I want a mirror.
I haven't taken a bath.
My face is ruined.
I have an audition tomorrow.
And I want a laptop
with Internet connection.
And--
-Three pairs of shorts.
-Shorts?
Ask for food.
Who cares about shorts?
Get some food
for this hungry dog.
Do we have Dominos over here?
And-- Do we--
Do we get to eat something?
And please give me my passport.
Please--
-Please get us free quickly.
-It stinks in here.
-Wait, one second.
-It stinks in here.
-Listen, girl.
-Yes?
Think of a scheme...
...so that I get to see the face
of every girl in this village.
What's this nonsense?
I mean, I have no experience
in such cases.
-Now you will.
-He'll get us killed.
If Dad finds out,
he'll kill me.
Forget your dad
and think about me.
Think about the one I love.
By the way...
...what does she look like?
Her little brown eyes
Her kohl-lined eyes
Her little brown eyes
Her kohl-lined eyes
When she smiles
I smile with her
I want to savor her
And I want to save her
From the evil eyes of this world
Oh, God
I plead to you
Show me a glimpse of her
Oh, God
I plead to you
I'll give up my life
For one glimpse of her
My friends
I don't know what's wrong with me
I am in and out of my senses
In a flash
I roam around
Lost and senseless
Please make me
Make sense of myself
My life has been
Meaningless so far
I've found a reason to live
I don't fall in love easily
Nothing can make my heart
Race so easily
Your eyes twinkle like stars
And you're like the moon
Who rises only at night
I want to burn and feel cold
At the same time
Under your burning gaze
Oh, God
I plead to you
Show me a glimpse of her
Oh, God
I plead to you
I'll give up my life
For one glimpse of her
Idiot, you make fun of my acting.
Why don't you try?
Okay, I won't. Stop hamming it up.
-What are you doing?
-Please.
Guys....
Choose one.
-I won't.
-Come on, please do it.
May I?
Okay. This one.
But what is the position?
-I am going.
-Where?
Chaudhary's house.
-Why didn't I think of it before?
-Listen.
Hold on.
What if we had chosen
the other one?
Then I would've talked
to Chaudhary directly.
You're crazy.
Why do you want to get us
in trouble all the time?
Let me tell you since
you're so desperate to hear.
I...
...love....
I love what?
I'm not in the mood.
Without Dimpy's love
Rajjo is sad
Shut up!
Dimpy was only in 5th grade
when I decided to marry her.
If her sister hadn't eloped...
...we would've been
enjoying our honeymoon.
I would be kissing her.
Mr. Chaudhary
has given his word.
What will I do with his promise?
Oh, God!
-Are we having a power outage?
-You're drunk, brother-in-law.
-Tenne.
-Sir, let me check.
-Are you done?
-Yes, sir.
The TV's switched off.
It was a nice song.
Without Dimpy's love
Rajjo is sad
Mr. Chaudhary
Doesn't listen to my pleas
-Where's the bottle?
-It's next to the glass.
Where's the bottle?
Empty.
The glass is empty.
Forget it.
Here. Have some cheese fritters.
Give me the fries.
Brother-in-law,
you're trying to fool me.
What are you saying?
There were some fritters left.
Right.
-Who said that?
-I did. What are you gonna do?
You slapped me.
Don't spit on me, man. Look
the other way when you talk.
-Nobody respects you.
-Go home.
-Brother-in-law, I'll teach you a lesson.
-Forget it.
Dear me
Baby
Hey.
Listen up, girl.
You didn't find that girl,
did you?
You're good for nothing.
I swear...
...I'll tell your father...
...that you had a role
in Renu's love story.
Now get up.
She couldn't even
find a girl.
-What are you doing here? Are you crazy?
-Who is it?
We had a power outage
at the wrong time.
Hey, Ms. Slim Waist.
Who was that?
You fool, that was Shalu.
Oh, yes.
Wait here.
Let me apologize to her.
What are you doing?
It's so dark in here.
You'll get us both killed.
Where are you?
You're drunk.
Maybe.
-Maybe? Where did you get it?
-It's fine. Come downstairs.
I'm coming.
Stay here.
-Don't move.
-Okay.
I'll be right back. Don't move.
I can't even see his face.
There's a power outage.
Did someone call the helpline?
We're the only ones having
a power outage in the entire village.
Sukhi, go check the meter.
Where did he go?
The water is chilly
What the...?
And the day is sunny
Shameless.
Come to the beach
And take my picture
Naked fellow, stop singing.
-I see.
-Gosh.
Sorry.
Did you come here
to take a bath?
I've been locked up in
that coop for so many days.
What if I find that
girl tomorrow?
He and his darn girl.
She won't like me.
Yeah, right.
What if she wants to take me
into her arms?
But you haven't found her yet,
you good-for-nothing.
Darn you.
It hurts.
Get away from here.
You'll get us killed.
-Here.
-What are you doing?
Here's something
that belongs to her.
-Find her in 24 hours.
-Fine, leave.
Or else I'll tell your father.
I know. Now, go
or we'll be in trouble.
I am going.
I don't know about her beauty,
but her figure is good.
Stupid fool.
Listen.
Put a lantern in Dimpy's room.
Sukhi. He was here.
-Who?
-That Bablu.
-Bablu?
-Yes.
He hit me again.
How? Like this?
The boys are locked up
in the shed.
You have been drinking too much.
Please, Lord,
help that crazy boy find the girl...
...and spare me.
Please. Please.
Please do it for me.
Take those guys out.
Throw them in the car.
Hurry.
Where are you taking us?
We're taking you to witness
your friend's death.
He had a knack
for eloping with girls.
How did you find out where he is?
The rascal called his mother.
He's hiding in Mohali.
Where will he run now?
Come on, move.
-Where are they?
-C Wing, 12th floor.
-Tenne.
-Yes, sir.
-Keep an eye on the boys.
-Sir.
Bro, I need to pee.
-What happened?
-Where did he go?
Forget it.
Let's take the stairs.
What are you doing?
-Where are you going?
-Who is he?
-Hey!
-Get down!
Bablu, what are you doing here?
I couldn't take the front door.
-Where's Rakesh?
-What's going on?
-Bablu?
-Bablu? What are you doing here?
We had a plan.
Why did you switch off
your phone at the last moment?
I didn't switch it off.
The guys from her family
broke it.
My family?
Sir, this side.
After you fled,
all of us were abducted.
Why did you call your mom?
Her family found out.
Reception committee's outside.
Open the door.
Open the door
or we'll break it open.
Renu, come on.
-Renu, come on.
-Renu, open the door.
You should go.
I will handle them.
-Bablu.
-Bablu, what are you doing?
You will fall down.
Bablu.
-Renu, careful.
-I will fall down.
Renu!
-Careful!
-Yes?
-Bablu!
-Go away!
-Who are you?
Pull her up.
Bablu!
Sir, this way.
Rajjo, search the balcony.
Where are they?
-I think they went to Goa.
-Quiet!
Come on, Renu, move.
Yes, sir?
Come on!
Stop! Stop!
Come on.
-Come on.
-Give me your hand.
Don't worry.
No need to be scared.
Just don't give up.
You two aren't wrong.
And yes....
Keep this.
Don't worry.
I'm here. I'll handle everything.
-Okay?
-Thanks, Bablu.
Listen....
Tell me something.
Are you two happy?
Yes.
Okay. No need to be scared.
I'll handle everything.
Okay? Don't give up!
Listen. Take care!
Take care.
He ran away.
He ran away.
-Sir, he ran away.
-I know.
-Why are you screaming?
-You know Bablu ran away?
Found an earring
Find those love letters.
Everyone is puzzled
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
By God, what a love story!
Have you seen him?
How does he look?
Is he handsome?
I am not interested.
And anyway, he's the same guy
who has made my dad's life hell.
Come on. Move it!
Lock them up.
-Shalu.
-Yes.
What are you doing here?
Nothing. Just cleaning up.
The place is so dirty.
No need. Get lost.
-Get out!
-Sure.
-Get in.
-Go on.
Bolt the door!
-Bablu, you cheat!
-Forget it.
You knew where Rakesh and Renu were
all this time!
You knew when they'd elope
and about their hideout.
You knew everything.
Why didn't you tell us?
Why should I?
You ratted on your friends
when they slapped you twice.
Another blow...
...and you would've told them
about Rakesh and Renu.
But, Bablu, try to understand.
That girl has a family.
They must be worried.
I don't care about them.
Rakesh is our friend, that's it.
I want to see him happy.
I'm not a hero like you are.
-We're your friends too.
-I know.
And when the time comes...
...I'll help you guys
like I helped Rakesh.
Bablu, that's not what we meant.
Try to understand.
Idiots, people would swear
by our friendship.
If you can help us all
escape from here...
...why are you risking
our lives for that girl?
Do you want to die for her?
I haven't thought about it yet.
You have gone crazy
over that girl.
Someone please explain to him.
Are you so crazy for that girl
that you don't care about us?
He has gone crazy.
You'll get killed
and you'll drag us down with you.
That girl....
-She heard everything.
-Really?
-Who was she?
-Oh, no.
-Where is she?
-Stop her.
You're amazing.
You got all the letters.
Actually, that boy is amazing.
He's been helping
Renu and Rakesh.
He's been helping them
all along.
He knew when they'd elope
and where they'd go...
...and he also knew
their address.
He knew.
Who is he?
-I don't know.
-Who is he?
I don't know, Uncle.
Didn't you hear me?
Who is he?
I don't know, Uncle.
Get those boys out!
Come on!
-Come on! Tell us.
-Uncle!
-Who is he?
-I don't know.
Speak up!
-Who among them is the guy?
-I really don't know.
-It hurts.
-What?
So what if it hurts?
You only care about your pain.
Look! Look at your father!
He raised both of you
with such love and care...
...only to be humiliated like this.
I really don't know, Uncle.
Tell us!
One of you knows
where Renu and Rakesh are!
Tell us where they are!
Who among you knows about them?
Speak up or I'll shoot
each one of you!
-No!
-Speak up. Who is it?
-Is it him?
-Speak up!
-Get lost.
-Take him away!
-Look at him!
-Sir!
-Speak up!
-Sir, I don't know--
I haven't done anything.
Please.
-Speak up!
-Sir, forgive me. Let go of me!
-I don't know, sir.
-Get lost.
Please trust me.
I don't know anything, sir.
Is he the one?
Speak up, Dimpy.
Look at him!
Is it him?
It's not me, sir.
Is it him? Speak up!
We've been wandering around
all these days.
We've been going crazy. Speak up!
Is it him?
I don't know, Uncle.
I really don't know.
You know everything. Tell us!
Speak up!
Come on!
Come on!
Is he the one?
Is he the guy?
Is he the guy?
Speak up, Dimpy!
Where have you hidden those two?
Speak up.
Speak up.
I swear, I'll skin you alive.
Where have you hidden those two?
Speak up!
Hey.
Why did you stop?
I was having fun.
He's so stubborn!
I'm still the same Suraj Singh
who murdered 18 people at night.
I'm helpless
because of my daughter.
If she'd been home,
I'd have killed her by now.
Have you thought about
why she isn't at home?
You're a good friend,
aren't you?
How much more beating
can you take for your friend?
How long can you beat me?
Kill him.
Not him.
So you want to be friends!
Let's see....
-Beat them up!
-Bablu, tell them, buddy.
Bablu knows.
Bablu, tell them!
-Bablu, tell them!
-Get up!
Bablu, they will kill us.
Bablu, tell them, buddy.
Sorry, sir.
Bablu, please, tell them, buddy!
Bablu, tell them!
Bablu!
Speak up!
They are in Delhi.
Delhi. Delhi, sir.
Life seems dull
Without you, without you
Without you, without you
Come on. Move it!
Move it!
Put them in the car.
-Tenne.
-Yes, sir.
Idiot, you had to fall in love
with Chaudhary's daughter?
Please don't look.
Please don't look.
Let him.
This love story's
going to end in two days anyway.
Come on. Hurry!
Yes.
We are leaving now.
Yes.
Start the car.
Listen.
Do you love someone?
Tell me if you love someone.
Someone else will get beaten up
because of you.
You are talking nonsense
in front of Mr. Chaudhary.
There's nothing wrong.
We're all going to Delhi.
What if she elopes
behind our back?
History will repeat itself.
Be brave if you love someone.
Speak up.
-Time to teach you a lesson.
-Rajjo.
He is trying to instigate me.
Put him in the car.
Come on!
This hero attitude only looks good
on-screen.
In real life,
the villain always wins.
Understood?
Stop the car.
Let's take Dimpy along.
-Take Dimpy along?
-We'll take Dimpy along.
Dimpy!
A hero wins, even in real life.
Now the love story begins.
Just whistle with me
Everybody go
Just whistle with me
Everybody go
Baby, come be my lady
Why do you make me crazy, beautiful?
I love you every day
I'll hold your hand and take you away
Baby, come be my lady
Why do you make me crazy, beautiful?
I love you every day
I'll hold your hand and take you away
I worry about the world
I won't let you hold my hands
I'm afraid you'll make
Some excuse and go away
Don't talk about leaving
I want to marry you
Come to me, bring your lips together
And whistle with me
Just whistle with me
Just whistle with me
Why are you so worried, baby?
I am your life, baby
It's your chance
So hold me tight
Or else you'll lose it today
Come with me
I'll teach you everything about love
Get a hundred out of a hundred
And bring your lips together
And whistle
-Just whistle, just whistle
-Yo!
-Everybody in the party, just whistle
-Yo!
-Just whistle
-Yo!
-Just whistle
-Just whistle with me
Dance with me
Keep my heart with you
My love
Girl, watch out
The boys are out to flirt with you
I won't give them a chance
I want to be yours
I won't find a crazy lover
Like you anywhere
If you want to do something
And move ahead in life
Come to me, bring your lips together
And whistle with me
Just whistle with me
Just whistle with me
Just whistle with me
God is great
Oh, my God.
We're in Delhi.
But what's the position?
Draft your wills, boys.
I didn't understand one thing.
You revealed their secret.
So now they will be caught.
They'd be caught
if they were in Delhi.
I lied to them.
You're such a scoundrel.
Friends are scoundrels.
And if they aren't,
they are not your friends.
They boarded the bus to Shimla.
These are the details received...
...from the other police stations
of Delhi.
Don't you want to confess?
Come on, tell me.
Inspector, this won't help.
Stop it.
-Hello, Mr. Chaudhary.
-Any information?
We've rounded up local
goons, gangsters...
...pimps, drug peddlers...
...from every nook
and corner of Delhi.
But we haven't gotten a clue yet.
-But we're trying--
-Trying?
Get lost!
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Please, just find my daughter
as soon as you can.
Otherwise I won't
be sorry next time.
Please.
I am really scared.
Bablu, can't we run away?
-Here.
-Very good.
We won't run anymore.
We'll make the Jats run
from one end to another.
-How much are you going to eat?
-This is the first one.
The first one's
just like the last one.
Try the green chutney.
Forget the green chutney...
...or else they'll get married.
Hey.
Get to the point.
If I know Rakesh...
...he'll go to a temple
to get married first.
What did you say?
Let's go to the temple.
Community wedding!
I want to get married too.
Do you have a mind of your own?
You always want
something or the other.
God.
Please bring Renu back.
I'll curse the day if I find out...
...that Renu eloped willingly.
I beg of you.
Renu.
Listen....
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
I haven't thought about it yet.
But I guess I'll go crazy now.
Do you know why
I brought you here?
Because no one dares
to tell lies here.
Honestly...
...I like you a lot.
And if you try...
...I guarantee you that
you'll start liking me too.
Are you showing me attitude,
even here?
I can't help it.
Everyone doesn't have it.
And I can't lose it.
Let go of my hand.
Okay.
-What's going on?
-Don't look at us.
Look at Lord Hanuman.
Wait, I'll tell Mr. Chaudhary.
-No.
-Tenne, come here.
-Why are you beating him?
-He's having a fit.
Then make him smell
leather boots.
-Do you have one?
-I do. I do.
-Then do it.
-No.
Search everyone properly.
Look at her face.
Please find someone else.
-I won't find anyone like you.
-Of course you will.
There are so many girls
in this world.
Make an effort.
That's what I am doing.
But I can't find anyone.
I am not handsome.
You are.
-Really?
-Yes. You're very handsome.
Really?
Look, you are tall.
-What are you saying?
-Your features are nice.
Anything else?
You have a good nose too.
What else do you want?
I don't have good lips.
They are fine.
No one's going to kiss me,
what's the point?
She will. Of course she will.
Will she?
Then what are you waiting for?
Darn this phone.
See! He held her hand.
Didn't I tell you
he held her hand?
What are you doing,
Mr. Chaudhary?
You left her all alone.
This place is teeming
with weirdos, you know.
Please hold on to her.
We couldn't find anyone here.
We looked everywhere.
If I know Rakesh...
...he might've gone to
the court to get married.
Let's check there.
Love commando,
you're acting too smart.
Stay within your limits.
I own brick furnaces.
Thanks for telling me.
You won't need a funeral pyre.
Brother, please sit here.
Sukhi and I'll go
and check inside.
Wait here. We'll go in
and make arrangements.
Please sit.
-Be comfortable, sister.
-We're comfortable, brother.
Why are you crying?
We'll be together forever
in no time.
The officer wants to know
where her parents are.
Tell him her father is busy
looking for us.
Don't cry.
Baby, it's no problem at all.
Excuse me.
Why is she crying?
She's missing her father.
Her father is a scumbag.
Sorry.
He makes millions,
drives a Mercedes.
But he is so narrow-minded.
Don't cry, my dear.
And who are you?
I drive her father's car.
I am her driver.
In fact, I was....
Her father used to
pay me peanuts.
He beat me up.
He said, ""Why do you love her?""
I eloped with his daughter.
Now let him search. Right?
-Won't your father be worried?
-He will, for a few days.
He'll look for us
and go to the police station.
We don't care.
We'll already be off to Manali
for our honeymoon.
Don't worry.
He'll come back to me begging.
Later on, he'll welcome me home.
Where do you get the courage?
From friends. Best friends.
Love you, buddy.
Haven't you heard that saying?
'""Ghalib, no one can control love.""
You must have,
it's a famous one.
By the way, what do you think?
Do you think the girl sitting next to you
will never fall in love?
Tell me, sister. Will you live
all your life with this man?
Is he your father?
Will you live with him?
Listen, her relatives
are looking for her.
Darn these relatives.
That's their nature.
They enjoy it
while the search goes on.
They snack till they drop.
Total fun.
Am I right, mister?
-Pull your stomach in.
-Rascal!
Do you think a court marriage...
...is the answer to your responsibilities?
Don't you have a conscience?
You eloped with the girl.
Didn't you think
about her parents?
And you? Do you like
hurting your parents?
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.
-And you--
-Brother...
...they are not in there.
Their application
isn't even in the register.
Shame on you.
Why are you crying?
Don't worry. That man's worried.
I love you.
Everything will be fine.
Without you, life is dull
Life is dull
Excuse me, mister.
Have you seen them?
No, sir. I haven't seen them.
Go away or you'll die.
Listen to me.
I told you. We have no future.
Thank God you told me.
Easy challenges don't excite me.
That's why I chose you
as my wife.
Here.
Marriage form.
I already signed it.
We're almost married.
Sign it and we'll be
all the way married.
What?
Mr. Chaudhary,
Renu is in that van!
Stop! You Idiot!
-Stop the van!
-Stop it.
Come out!
-Get everyone out.
-Out!
Get down! Hurry!
-You! Get down now!
-Keep moving. Keep moving.
Come on, get down.
Come out now!
-Renu!
-The last one, come out now!
Come on!
-Renu!
-Didn't you hear me?
-Get down!
-Renu!
Renu.
Get out of the way.
Why are you guys
forcing everyone to get out?
You just want to
trouble everyone.
Madam, forgive me.
I made a mistake.
It was a mistake.
Everyone makes one.
Let's go.
Dimpy. Dimpy.
There was a girl sitting here.
Did you see her?
-No, sir.
-Dimpy.
Mister, my daughter was sitting
right here. Did you see her?
She was wearing a blue dress.
-Dimpy!
-Look there!
Mr. Chaudhary,
it's your mistake.
Why did you bring her along?
You lost both your daughters now.
No! Let go of me! Save me!
Go away! What are you doing?
No! No! No!
Help! Save me!
Let go of my hand!
Save me! Help!
Leave me! Help!
God is great
Let me go! Help!
Let me go!
Save me! No!
Let go of my hand!
Let go of me! No.
Go away!
It's a small word.
Nahi  in Hindi.
""No"" in English.
And no means no.
Bablu!
Without you, life is dull
Life is dull
Dimpy!
Dimpy!
Search there!
Dad!
How dare you touch her!
How dare you!
Are you a kid?
Don't you know that
you should stay together?
What if something
had happened to you today?
-Stay within your limits.
-Rajjo!
Dress your wounds.
Come on.
Come on.
Listen....
It was an eventful day.
I didn't even thank you.
What for?
For saving me.
No one can save you, Dimpy.
Your life's already over.
I never got along
with my father.
He would ask me to do something,
and I always said no.
Have you ever said no
to your father?
No, right?
Have you ever lived
the way you wanted?
No.
Your family treats women
like animals.
Have you ever revolted?
You have to fight.
That's how you get equality.
You just get one life.
Do you get it?
-We only live once.
-Bablu, I want to live too.
-But--
-No ifs and buts.
Be brave.
Admit to your father
that you love me.
But you love your dreams,
don't you?
Yes.
So choose one.
Choose?
Go ahead.
Let's stay up all night
Let's not go home
Let's stay up all night
Let's not go home
You're with me
What's there to worry about?
Let's not go home
Let's stay up all night
Let's go wherever we want to
We might not meet
Each other again
Let's live our lives tonight
This night
Let's stay up all night
Let's not go home
I wonder why this night
Wants me to change everything
The night wants me
To touch the sky
And live in the moment
Tonight
So let's get up
And walk and falter
Let's get up and fly
I'll lend you my wings
Let's live our lives tonight
This night
-Let's stay up all night
-Up all night
-Let's stay up all night
-Up all night
-Let's not go home
-Don't go home
Let's stay up all night
Let's stay up all night
Let's not go home
Sir, this is the guest house.
Clean this mess
and leave Room 2.
Open Room 7.
Tell us where they have gone.
I never ask a man if he has eloped
with someone's daughter...
...or someone's wife.
I charge them by the hour.
That's all.
-Who are you guys?
-Hey!
Just tell us
where we can find them.
They ran out of money.
The girl pawned her
gold necklace.
After that,
she had nothing to offer.
But I asked her
to pay the rent first...
...or get out of here.
Who is going to pay me now?
Rascal!
Don't touch him.
How do you know it was them?
Did they look like them?
That's them.
It was them.
Now pay up.
Come on.
Do you want to die?
Come on!
-What's wrong with you?
-Come on!
What's wrong with you?
Sir. Sir, calm down.
-Come on!
-You should go home, Mr. Chaudhary.
-Everyone is looking for you.
-What home?
Yes.
The lodge where my daughter stayed.
You saw the lodge, didn't you?
This is where
he kept my daughter.
Is this why they eloped?
Is this what you call youth?
Don't we understand
their feelings?
Even I was young 25 years ago.
I was so arrogant.
I never listened to anyone.
No one. I never listened
to my parents or my wife.
But then I became a father...
...when Renu was born.
She was so small
when I first held her.
I quit all my vices.
I slogged away.
I became rich,
and people respected me.
I even learned English for her.
And then someone
took her away from me.
Love....
Is this what you call love?
They are broke.
That guy is not capable
of supporting them.
He got help from his friends
and eloped with her...
...and he thinks he is a hero.
Is this how you become a hero?
He sold her gold necklace
when he ran out of money.
And if they don't get along...
...will he divorce her?
But...
...I can't abandon my daughter.
I am a father.
I raised her,
took care of her for 20 years.
I've fulfilled every responsibility
of a father.
I wanted to get her married.
I wanted her to be happy.
But where's my daughter?
Where is she?
I have lost her.
My reputation is tarnished.
I've lost everything.
I want my daughter back.
Where's my daughter?
Where's my daughter?
Where's my daughter?
Where's my daughter?
The day I find her...
...I'll kill her.
I'll kill her
right then and there.
Listen....
Do you think
they will be caught?
I don't know.
You know...
...earlier even I wanted them
to be caught.
But everyone has a right
to make their own decisions.
I should too.
Because we only
live once, right?
Do we have to run away
like them?
I can't tell my dad...
...but I'll tell you.
I love you.
I love you, Bablu.
Renu!
Renu, stop!
-Start the car.
-Renu!
Renu!
Renu!
Stop the bus!
Renu!
-Dad?
-Renu!
Stop the bus!
Dad.
Renu!
Renu!
Renu, stop!
-Renu!
-Renu!
Renu, come on!
-Renu!
-Come on!
Beat him!
Let him go.
Leave him!
No, Dad, don't beat him!
-No!
-Move it!
Come on!
-Move.
-Try hitting me now.
Let go of them.
Dad, please spare him.
Move back!
Don't touch them!
Sir, please forgive them.
Mr. Chaudhary,
please forgive them.
-Move away.
-Dad, please!
Dad, let him go.
-Sir, please hear me out.
-Don't you dare!
Don't you dare touch him!
I'll file a complaint
with the police.
He's my husband.
Had I told you,
would you let me marry him?
Why don't I have the right
to make a decision for myself?
Why?
Dimpy....
Tell me, what was my mistake?
Is it a crime
to fall in love?
Why don't you let us
live in peace?
You've been chasing us like dogs.
Like dogs! Why?
-Renu!
-No!
She's right.
She's right.
I am a dog.
We're all dogs.
You ran away from home.
I was worried about you
the whole time.
I was worried whether
you were all right.
I've been roaming from one city
to another looking for you.
I fought with so many people.
I barked at them
and I snapped at them.
I am a dog.
Thank you for reminding me
of who I am.
I thought I was your father.
But I am just a dog
who is worried for his daughter.
I am a dog.
Dog.
Forgive me, my dear.
I was wrong.
I am a dog. Forgive me.
Enough, Renu.
Now apologize to him...
...and say that he kidnapped you.
Say it!
Your life will be spared.
Or else you know our law.
Say it.
Brother, please turn around.
Sit down. Sit down.
Didn't you hear us?
Lower your heads.
Look at your shoes. Look down!
Look down!
Dad...
...I am pregnant.
You are dead to me.
Now I have just one daughter.
Yes, we are about to return.
Dimpy, get in the car.
Bablu....
Sorry for the way
we treated you.
You are not my enemy.
I just love my daughter
too much.
Please don't say that.
If you get the time...
...do attend Dimpy's wedding.
Kiki, here's your passport.
Now you can go on
an adventure tour.
-See you, buddy.
-Kiki.
Goodbye.
Let's forget our differences.
I spared your life
because of Chaudhary's presence.
Otherwise I would've
burned you in a furnace.
Bablu, it's all right.
It's all right.
O, God
Why are you angry with me?
I wonder what mistake I made
My life went astray
When I got separated from you
I'll destroy myself
I'll destroy myself
I'll destroy myself
Kohl burns in my eyes
I can't wear my stubborn bangles
My bangles will jangle
Only in your presence, my beloved
I don't want to get decked out
Without my beloved
I wonder what mistake I made
My life went astray
When I got separated from you
I'll destroy myself
I'll destroy myself
Just tell us one thing.
Can you live without her?
Let's go, then.
Let's abduct her.
Come on.
Clitter-clatter
The train chugs along
-Hold on, stop the train.
-Red signal.
Where's Dimpy?
How many times are
you going to ask, Grandpa?
Let's go play.
Come on. Come on.
I always thought...
...that I'd be safe in my home.
But today....
Today I am feeling scared.
Dad took me to Delhi...
...because he didn't trust me.
But I was determined...
...to never do
what Renu had done.
But when I left Bablu,
I realized why Renu eloped.
In this family, a girl child
is killed right after birth.
Dad didn't kill us then...
...but he is killing us now.
What should I do, Shalu?
Pappi, the guys from Delhi
are back!
-Brother, look who's here.
-Wow!
We treated you badly,
but you guys are here.
Good, very good.
So far, you've only
witnessed our fury.
It's time you see our love.
That's what we're here for.
Come on, please come inside.
You look so happy.
Yes.
He is here now.
I am not scared anymore.
Bhuppi, where's that boy?
Stop him.
-The wedding procession?
-No.
Bablu....
Bablu? Why him?
Forget it. I'll check myself.
-Where are you going?
-Nowhere.
Where are your friends?
They must be around
here somewhere.
Are you looking for someone?
Actually, I--
You're free, aren't you?
Come on. Let's talk.
Bablu, how about a cold drink?
He'll drink it later on.
Offer it to someone else.
Come on.
Have a seat.
Sit down.
-I--
-What pleasant weather.
Everyone's really happy.
He is a very nice guy.
He comes from a reputed family.
-If you--
-What about your family?
-Parents?
-They are fine.
I didn't expect you
to drop in like this.
But you did the right thing.
Because everyone's busy
with the wedding preparations...
...and I am all alone.
Now that you're here,
I could use some company.
Stay with me till the send-off.
Till the send-off. Please.
Will you stay with me?
My hand.
My hand.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Listen....
-Is everything ready?
-Yes.
I've given the message
to Shalu the maid.
She'll deliver it to Dimpy.
There you are.
I've been looking
all over the place.
The guests are about to arrive.
Go and get changed.
And leave him alone?
The poor guy is alone.
He's here to attend the wedding,
not to chat with you. Come on.
Go, I'll just have
a chat with him.
You see...
-...the groom--
-He isn't going anywhere...
-...till the wedding is over. Come on.
-No, no.
The guests are about to arrive.
Come on.
-I'll be right back.
-Come on.
Not this one. Yes.
Brother, your turban.
-Do you know where he is?
-I don't know.
-Bablu.
-Where's Dimpy?
-We're looking for her.
-I have no idea.
Forget it.
Look over there.
I will. Relax. Just relax.
Bablu.
Has anyone seen Dimpy?
Remember you always said...
...that you stopped
because you saw me.
You inspired me to live my life.
I started flying.
I started living.
How do I tell Dad...
...that I want to live my own life?
He knows everything.
Oh, my God!
So, what is the position now?
Their position
is worse than ours.
-Dear, did we get laddus?
-Hurry! Let's go.
Hey....
What happened, Dad?
Why are you staring
at me like that?
Nothing.
You took such good care of me.
Yes.
You've always been there for me.
Today you're sending me
to a place...
...where you won't be with me.
But your decision must be right.
I can see my entire life, Dad.
But I will manage somehow.
Don't worry, Dad.
What happened, brother?
She has to leave someday.
Enough.
Get up.
Get her ready.
You know what's going on
in my house.
My daughter's getting married.
And you are also aware...
...that a boy eloped
with my elder daughter.
And now, you....
Why are you here?
Be honest.
You came here to elope with
my younger daughter, didn't you?
Eloping isn't difficult,
Mr. Chaudhary.
Nor am I scared.
When Renu ran away...
...I was amused
that you were troubled.
But when I saw you...
...I gradually realized
what a father feels...
...when his daughter runs away.
Today when I noticed
your plight...
...I was really scared.
I never thought
like this before.
I was happy.
I was always happy.
But today....
Today, I am sad.
There is no one.
I have no one
to share my pain.
No one can understand either.
But you can understand.
The other day Dimpy
went missing for 20 minutes...
...and I was worried to death.
Later I realized
Renu was missing for 20 days.
Do you know what's going on
in this house?
The girl I love
is getting married.
And she is also your daughter.
You want no trouble
at the wedding...
...and I want to stop
this wedding at all cost.
You want to save your honor...
...and I want to save my love.
We're sailing in the same boat.
No one loves Dimpy like you do.
But if there's anyone
who comes second...
...that would be me.
I came here to take her away.
But I'm not going to elope
with your daughter.
Bablu, what are you doing?
When it was time to act,
you got scared.
One needs courage to do
what I am doing.
Chaudhary knows Dimpy loves you.
Still he's getting her
married to Rajjo.
This is wrong.
Fathers are not always wrong.
Love commando.
Where are you going?
As soon as I got the news
that you were here...
...I came here to welcome
you personally.
You came here to attend
Rajjo's wedding, didn't you?
So you've got to have something.
Choose one.
What would you like
to have, this or this?
Please let us go.
This time, you won't
leave this place alive.
You've come unprepared.
You've got only
three boys with you.
Kill him!
Let him go!
Don't beat him!
Bablu!
Bablu!
Bablu!
Please spare him!
Please let him go.
Bablu!
-Bablu!
-Where's all the attitude you had?
That's it?
Where's all the attitude you had?
I'll put an end to you here.
And back there, it'll be
Dimpy's opening ceremony.
You....
-Bablu, kill him.
-Beat him.
-Bablu, beat him up.
-Don't spare him.
Beat him.
Bablu, kill him.
Finish him off.
Finish him off!
Stop!
Mr. Chaudhary--
What's so special about you?
Why does Dimpy love you?
I can't understand.
The wedding procession
is at the gate...
...but I'm standing here.
Why?
Because you love
your daughter a lot.
I don't want to
take away your right...
...to decide whom she marries.
If her future husband...
...troubles her in any way...
...I won't spare you.
If her future husband
troubles her in any way...
...I won't spare you.
Go on.
Take her away.
Brother, what about
our family honor?
I just want to see respect
in Dimpy's eyes.
You mean love marriages
are okay in the Jat Land?
If the boy is worthy,
then we don't have a problem.
Brother,
I am having an affair too.
-Me too, sir.
-Sukhi, you....
Bless you, son.
Please forgive Rakesh
and Renu too.
Yes.
So you got a hero attitude.
I can't help it.
Others don't have it
and I can't lose it.

Jai (Zayed Khan) and Naina (Dia Mirza) are almost ""settled"" in their lives but missing something or someone who will complete them. Jai feels that magic and serendipity have passed him by. Naina is a successful photographer and has taught herself that a less-than-fulfilling life is enough for her. But is it?

Govind (Cyrus Sahukar) has a colourful past and is on his way to another major, seemingly all-wrong relationship. But what if this 'mistake' is the love he has been looking for all his life? Sheila (Tisca Chopra) has stayed single for a long time, waiting for Mr. Perfect. When he does appear, will she take her chance at love and look beyond the odds that divide to see what binds them in a perfect whole?

Ritu (Umang Jain) lives on breakups and ice cream. Will she ever find a man and share a beginning and not just a closure? Arjun (Satyadeep Mishra) and Gayatri (Auritra Ghosh) are the perfect couple on the brink of a dream wedding. Will their love inspire others to listen to their hearts? Dhruv (Vaibhav Talwar) and Radhika (Pallavi Sharda) are driven workaholics, ignoring the small text of their lives. Will they wake up to see what they have missed in their desire for everything?

The characters try to find personal truths, shed illusions, laugh, cry, grow, and learn the biggest lesson of all: that even if you don't go looking for love, it will come looking for you.",1398,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt1877691.srt","I can't imagine the

Hi. Happy Valentine's Day.
Same to you.
This is for you.
Thank you.
This is for me?
- Yes!
Happy Valentine..
Hello.
- How are you, Jai?
Hi mom!
Well... do you like it?
It's a guitar.
Yes!
Naina you know I cant even
sing happy birthday in tune
I don't know how to
play the guitar, love.
I have ingestion today.
Mom, why aren't you having
those organic vegetables?
It's not available.
- At least wash it in potassium.
Nowadays it is very chlorine.
- Yes.
Listen, will you talk to your
aunt?
- Surely.
I have to take this.
As if you have the
time to teach me to play.
Hello. Yes..
Oh no, we're having dinner at
home.
Listen, talk to your aunty.
- Okay.
Sorry!
It's okay. Greetings aunty-ji.
How are you?
Very well, how are you?
What's the special gift?
Well... he has
prepared a fabulous dinner.
I almost forgot.
Your gift.
Oh my God! They are beautiful.
Next time you can expect a
necklace.
as soon as this deal comes
through.
But these must be very
expensive.
So? You're worth it.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
You've been saying it for
months.
Okay, I will talk to
you about this next time.
Put aunty on line, mom.
Hello aunty-ji, how are you?
You find it amusing, huh?
You know it's quite logical.
I don't think your mom is wrong.
Tell me, why aren't
you getting married?
You want the truth...
I haven't heard that
loud bell in my heart
Bell? What's a bell
got to do with marriage?
I know Radhika is great...
she is beautiful, smart,
intelligent.
And I guess successful too.
Actually, she is a lot
more successful than you.
Anyway.
- I don't know, man!
It takes a few years of
marriage
for couples to get to where we are.
You know what I mean.
Well... I mean...
for example, you and Nandini.
Remember that life?
What's the word for it...
it's...
boring?
- Boring!
Bland, regular,
like a routine, you know!
I understand.
But why do you understand?
It's because you did
things differently.
You priorities were different.
God forbid, Govind if...
I get... I get it, Jai.
It was my marriage,
I was there, I get it.
Sorry!
- That's fine.
That's not what I meant.
But just imagine. And trust me.
Its good she left you
I mean you left her
It's fine, dude.
It didn't work.
How does it matter who left
whom?
Well sometimes even I forget.
I miss the energy, the good
times...
The college days, the
single and ready to mingle days.
I wonder if I will
ever feel that way again.
The excitement, the magic
that fills up your heart.
Bell! Ding dong Bell bro!
Relax bro... You'll hear it
But when?
But Jai, it's your fault.
Why don't you talk to Radhika?
Talk to Radhika?
There is no talking to radhika.
There is only listening to
Radhika
And a discussion about this?
She could kill me.
She is quite psycho.
- Yeah, a bit.
What? Power failure in Mumbai?
Oh no! The rest of my
ice-cream will melt!
If the ice-cream melts
you will die, right?
Trust me, Naina. Ice cream is
the best cure for a break-up.
The best cure for a
break-up is also a patch up,
Ritu.
Why don't you speak with Kunal?
He has apologised a million
times.
Saying sorry comes easy but
being faithful is the difficult
part.
But what did he do?
One silly sms...
He did nothing
because I had read his sms.
I can't imagine what he
would've done otherwise.
And you tell me...
How long does it take these
days for an SMS to become an
MMS ?
The point is there is no mms.
You are overacting... a little
bit.
Don't you worry, Jai.
I tell you honestly, our
generation's
number 1 problem is this.
Radhika?
Relationships, man. - Yes.
- Relationships. - Right.
Everyone's in a mess. You know
that.
Now you want to smoke this?
No!
Throw it away. You'll die
if you continue smoking.
Come on. Let's go now.
Come on, our manager
must be waiting for us.
To hell with him! Project
report!
You know... can't live with
them...
Hello. - Hi. - Can't live
without them. - Correct. -
Let's go!
You know, yesterday she was
checking my nails. - Please.
You miss him, don't you?
A lot.
Well... it is said that
time heals everything.
Perhaps one day you will
forgive him.
Until then you have
ice cream. Indulge in it!
I hope I don't run out of
flavours!
Naughty! Stupid!
Are you taking guitar lessons?
It was a gift meant for Dhruv..
.. but I guess now
I'll have to take lessons.
Men are the same everywhere.
Yet we dream of
spending our lives with them.
That reminds me
Gayatri is getting married.
Really? Wow! What is
the name of the guy?
Arjun, really nice guy.
She is very happy.
Are you going for it?
- Of course!
You should come along.
Apparently you meet some
good guys at weddings.
Chandigarh. For marriage?
Come on, Jai.
I thought if you don't come
along,
it won't be half as fun.
Actually it won't be any fun.
Please Jai! Can you see how
much work I have on my head?
Tomorrow morning is the
seminar,
it's going to be very hard.
You mean you really can't...
you swear you can't?
Are you really going
to miss me that much?
I swear.
Fine, I'll figure something.
It won't be easy but
I'll try to make it.
Radhika, I think I'm putting
you under a lot of pressure.
You are so honest and hard
working and I'm plain selfish.
It's ridiculous.
No, Jai, it's fine. I'll sort
it out.
No, it's okay. I'll go alone.
Jai, listen to me...
No, Radhika, I
shouldn't bear on your work.
Please, I swear.
Really?
Yeah.
That's so sweet of you.
So, what is it?
Govind, Radhika is...
Damn! Here we go again.
Radhika-isn't-coming...
What are you talking...
you are joking?
You know I get stressed very
easily.
Keep it down or she'll hear us.
Touchwood! This is great news,
pal.
I was craving a vacation.
I need a break, it's too much.
We're taking a vacation,
brother!
What are you doing?
- I don't know. - Let's go!
I still need to pack the
magazines!
Good morning, ma'am. Your
flight
to Delhi is on time. - Thank you.
You expect me to carry
this bag? It's so heavy!
Naina?
Yeah!
How did you know?
Magic.
Just kidding!
Arjun said you'll be
travelling with us.
So he asked me to look out for
you.
And I've been asking every
single girl the same thing!
Naina?
The bus isn't here yet?
The bus is here and so are the
guests.
We were waiting for you.
It's over there.
Okay. Phone!
Yeah!
I am sorry, Dhruv.
You have to make it.
You can't miss the ""sangeet""
ceremony.
Okay, bye!
Sorry, they're heavy.
No, no, not at all. It's fine.
Come on.
""We don't start a fight.""
""Every day and night
we try to fight.""
Jai, would you please
look over my bag for me?
I will just come.
- Yes, sure.
Now we also know
each other very well.
I mean, your bags are
quite heavy... quite some time.
We spent quite some time
together.
Do you always crack such jokes?
Yes. Why? Would you
prefer some other type?
You could try.
Really? Any particular type?
For example, jokes
people can actually laugh at.
Dude! Beautiful girl-one,
Jai-zero!
By the way did you hear a bell?
Just sit down! Nobody
asked for your expert advice.
But your jokes sure
were a class apart!
""Look, the paths are
calling out to us.""
""We are walking without
thinking.""
""I am thinking this is
where I want to be.""
""Beloved, meet me someday.""
I can't wait to get
to Chandigarh, man.
Sir, the engine needs to cool
down.
We'll go and some water. Let's
go.
Why is he yelling?
Forget it. Here, everybody
yells.
What's wrong?
Nothing, the engine needs to
cool
down. Should take a few minutes.
Okay, I'll be right back.
Hello... where do
you think you're going?
The restroom in the bus is a
mess
So don't go alone.
We'll come along. Right?
No, it's okay. I am fine,
really!
Naina, it's a jungle.
It's not safe out here.
What say, Govind?
I mean... it's safe but...
we should go.
We should go!
Then you hold onto this.
Thanks!
What?
- Look at you...
matching!
- So?
It's amazing.
She made you a
porter as soon as you met.
And now both of us are
standing here as security
guards.
By the time we get to
Chandigarh...
Then what?
Come on...
You know Govind, I
just realised something.
You have become very negative.
Be positive, brother!
We are on a vacation,
remember the trip has just
begun.
There's lots of good
stuff in store for us.
Really? Good stuff... like what?
Guys, can please sing a song?
This is really weird!
Sing!
""Life is a beautiful journey.""
""Nobody knows what will
happen in the future."" - Louder!
""Understand what the gestures
say.""
""Listen. Everybody is
calling to us from the heart.""
""I am thinking this is
where I want to be.""
""Beloved, meet me someday.""
Start.
Come on.
Gayatri.
Great, you can take
them to the hotel.
If you need something call me,
okay?
Don't worry. I am there.
Arjun, I still can't believe
that..
..you and Gayatri
are getting married.
It's amazing! Time flies, man!
You know actually she's quite
hot.
Govind, have some respect.
What's disrespectful about that?
She is hot, so she is!
Shut up man, don't
talk nonsense. Keep quiet.
What's wrong with you?
If a girl is gorgeous you
can use other adjectives too...
like hot, sexy, cute... you
know.
Just shut up!
Are you mad? Have you lost it?
I'd rather not talk to you.
Let me ask Arjun. You
don't have a problem..
..if I refer to her as
hot and sexy, do you?
I mean, in a nice way.
But actually,
Govind, there is a problem.
Yeah! She is quite reserved.
You don't know her very well.
You know... besides Gayatri
is like your sister-in-law.
- Correct! - Gayatri?
Where did she come from? I
wasn't talking about her.
I was talking about her friend
..
..and Mr. Ding Dong
Bell here sang for her.
Drat! You mean Naina?
-Naina!
- She is hot.
That's what I said.
- Brother, she is hot!
- I told you so! - She is hot!
Guys... what do you
think of Gayatri? I mean...
Jai, tell him.
She's good, very sweet.
Aunty and uncle will
love her. Right, Govind?
Of course! Can I get some
water...
my throat's parched.
I know that. But do
you think she is hot?
I mean 'hot'?
Answer him, Jai.
She is sweet, she is nice.
What say, Govind?
Oh no, nice won't do.
What's his question?
Arjun asked if she is hot.
Do you think Gayatri is hot?
- Hot!
God Gayatri! We've been
discussing
your marriage for ages now.
We haven't, you have been.
You've been discussing my
marriage
since you were in the 6th grade.
So cute!
But just imagine.
Now each day will begin
and end with Arjun for you.
It's perfect.
I know!
So we've decided that
Naina is hot, right?
And Gayatri isn't
that what you're saying?
- Answer him! - Yeah!
He is speechless.
- Speechless.
Alok, how're you doing?
You look very smart!
Hello.
- Hello.
Where's Biji?
Sexy.
Bloody Mary.
Arjun, I want to see Biji.
Hurry up.
- Quick. - Thank you.
Nice, huh?
The combo is unbelievable.
Greetings Biji, guess who is
here.
How are you, Biji?
- Greetings to you. - Bless you!
I hope you are ready with a
sizzling
performance for the ""sangeet"".
Like the 'Infamous Munni'!
Idiot! This Munni isn't
infamous,
she is sick.
You are shameless. On the phone
you keep saying you'll visit me.
I got caught up with work, Biji.
Is it work or a beautiful girl?
Greetings Biji!
I can't help it. You helped
your grandson Arjun find a girl.
You don't care about me.
Well that's because I am sure
that
you will find a girl for yourself.
So, how's the lady of the house?
Have you'll decided on
something?
Well the thing is... you see...
I, what do you say?
- Biji, he hasn't heard the
bell yet!
That's good. There's still some
hope.
You are so naughty! Can't
wait for your performance.
I'd love to dance but the
doctor's advice is, 'Just
Chill'.
To hell with the doctor!
I would only if he
weren't Arjun's dad.
Arjun, my sweetie pie!
You look happy, Biji,
finally you are smiling.
This is Naina, Gayatri's best
friend.
She is gorgeous, just like
Gayatri.
Are you married?
No.
What's wrong with
the boys these days!
Such a beautiful girl
and she isn't married yet.
Biji, Naina has a boyfriend.
His name is Dhruv.
Is he here with you?
No, he is caught up with work.
What's the use of such a
boyfriend?
That's just like Jai.
I suggest you keep your eyes
open..
..you will find
someone as sweet as Naina.
Okay then! I think
you should rest now.
Let's freshen up, Arjun?
Let me show you to your room.
Bye, Biji.
- Yes, son.
Love you, sexy.
- Go and rest.
Fritters are ready.
Thanks.
- There is some..
You haven't changed a bit!
That's true.
Thanks pal for waking me up!
It gives me joy to wake you up,
to bring you tea in bed...
Obviously. - And probably
even massage your feet.
Correct!
- No problem, come on.
I'm starving.
Too late! Buffet is over,
but there's lots of beer.
Of course, I can see that
but it's also good to share.
What have you all decided
for the pre wedding party?
It's simple, dude
Vodka, Bacardi, some wine,
if you insist. That's all, bro.
Drinks apart other things are
necessary for an entertainment
value.
But thanks.
- Very well!
From the outside you are Dr.
Jekyll but you really are Mr.
Hyde!
What?
- What a pleasant surprise!
So, what do you have
in mind, like Russians?
Russians at home? Jai,
do something, please!
Ignore him! So what were you
saying?
Well, we were thinking that ..
..the 'boys versus
girls' competition is passÃ©.
I agree! But the boys'
side is always the best.
- Right, Arjun? - Absolutely!
What rubbish! You don't
stand a chance against us!
I see.
- What say, Naina?
Absolutely! You can
try us out anytime.
Probably another day.
And it's our favourite song.
No, no, Gayatri!
How filmy can you be! Come on!
I think it's rather sweet.
Exactly. - It's their
wedding and their performance.
I think we should do it. Let's
do it.
I think you should
call for some more vodka.
This is turning into
a ""Hum Aapke Hain Kaun"" sequel.
That's jasmine! Do you smell
jasmine?
It must be aunt Sheila.
Hi aunt Sheila.
Hello...
Welcome!
- How are you? - Great!
Nice to see you. Hello...
How nice of you to show up.
You're a day late!
About time you got married.
She's been waiting for years.
Anyway, you know how I
love weddings. I just love it.
The questions fielded by
the aunts and uncles...
it takes a while to prepare
yourself.
Everyone present here knows you
don't want to marry. So relax.
Where's uncle?
He needs even more time to
prepare himself, you know!
Now come on, I have to
show you something. - What?
- Let's go. - Okay.
Hello Soniaji, this is Sheila.
Hi.
- Hi. Very close to the family.
She's like a younger sister to
me.
Nice to meet you.
You teach Urdu, don't you?
- Yes. Yes.
I have heard a lot about you.
- Shall we go?
I'm really sorry.
I suppose you are
inconvenienced by my arrival.
Sorry? Of course.
Everyone's excited since
they are meeting after ages.
Govind.
- Sheila.
Aren't you performing with
the others at the ""sangeet""?
Dancing is fun.
Well... nobody asked.
Really? That's shocking!
Alright, this stuff is very
simple.
Everyone will take a
chit from this bowl.
Boys will take yellow and girls
red.
And what about green?
There is no green here.
- Okay.
People with the same number..
.. will be partners at
the ""sangeet"" ceremony.
Boys... girls... are you ready?
Yes, of course!
- Cool.
Good luck. Now pick up the chit.
Ladies first.
Yeah, what is this?
Oh, no.
- Oh, no.
These chits are scary.
I hoping for the right partner.
- I agree.
Boys.
- Come on. - What a masculine
colour!
Great, Pinku has taken two!
Two.
Now open your chits and
say the number out loud.
Nikki, we will start with you.
It's two...
Two.
- Two. - Tow. I've got two!
I'm a... four.
-Oh... I'm a...
- I'm four!
And that means you are three.
Correct! I am three.
Don't know what I was thinking.
I'm three.
Just imagine... partners!
Yeah.
- Naina, that means you are
three.
Yes.
- You are three. - Yes. - Okay.
How surprising... just imagine.
Yes, partners. Let's
begin the rehearsal.
No, that's for tomorrow.
It's all planned.
It will be fun.
- Okay. And now?
Now all of you can quickly
freshen up for dinner. Don't be
late!
Yes.
- Alright. - Yes. - Bye, aunt.
Dad, come on! Let's go.
""Your kohl eyes look beautiful.""
""An innocent boy got enticed.""
""When you turned and looked
behind.""
""I fell in love with you.""
""I fell in love with you.""
Naina... Naina, wait up!
- Hey partner! - Hi Jai.
You are looking very nice.
I know!
Where's Govind?
Getting dressed I guess.
Nice guy.
Since when do you know Gayatri.
We went to boarding school
together.
Best friends then.
And now?
We're still very
close but as you know...
- she's a Delhi girl. - And
soon to be a Chandigarh girl.
Right. And I live in Bombay.
So are you a Maharashtrian?
My dad was.
Sorry.
No, not about being
Maharashtrian,
of course. The ""was"" part.
It's okay.
Actually, you and me
have that in common.
Really? Your father
is also Maharashtrian?
No, dad was a Punjabi.
Was being the common part
I am sorry.
It's okay.
Hey... Jai wait!
- Hi... - There you are!
Are we practicing today?
The engagement isn't today?
- Let's go. - Yes, let's!
There are so many functions,
it's difficult to keep track.
Oh wow!
- Wow!
Wow! This is so beautiful.
I'm sure Arjun has nothing to
do
with this. He is colour blind.
We're going to have a great
time.
- Naina. Naina, come here.
Look. Okay, I'll see you later.
Bye.
- Hi... - Hello..
This one?
Tonight is going to be a good
night.
It's going to be a great night.
Which one do you think?
- I think this one.
Hi.
- Hold on.
Govind, she said hi.
Show me.
- See this.
Usually people wave back.
I should say hi...
Yes, I should reply.
Yes. I will have to see
when I find out. - Yes.
You like to..
Hello Sheila.
Hi.
How are you?
- I'm fine.
How are you?
- Good.
You're wearing a jasmine
perfume?
- Yes...
It's really nice.
- Thank you.
Okay.
- Okay...
Cool? Happy?
- I'm sure auntie Sheila is.
It's Sheila!
Auntie Sheila.
It's Sheila!
Are you and Arjun brothers?
- No.
Are you cousins?
- No.
Are you a distant relative?
- Of course not!
So then She is Arjun's aunt.
Why
should we call her auntie Sheila?
Have some respect
for her feelings, dude.
Will you like it if
everyone called you uncle?
Well no... not if I'm 40.
- She is 38. Thirty eight!
- What 38?
Sheila is 38.
Wow! Big difference.
It is a big difference, Jai.
A lot can happen in two years.
Two years ago, I was married...
while you were fluttering
around like a butterfly.
Two years later, I'm single...
Bro, according to your mom,
you should be married!
Radhika misses you. Think about
it.
Why are you getting personal?
- Thanks, uncle!
Asshole.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have you attention please.
Woo-hoo!
Thank you, thank you...
Thanks dad... sorry, dads!
No, go ahead Arjun,
this is your day.
I'd like to say something...
to Gayatri.
It was during my 7th grade
vacation..
..that I went to my
grandmother's place and...
..that's when I saw
Gayatri for the very first time.
She was in the home
opposite ours and...
..along with her friends she
was trying to steal ice cream.
I don't think she was
successful
and I know this sounds very filmy...
..but that day in her little
pink frock, she stole my heart.
Wow!
And, today after 14 years of
innumerable breakups and
patch-ups...
I'm going to return the favour!
I am finally stealing Gayatri
away from all of you. Forever.
Sorry everyone!
Congratulations!

Teach. Please.
One, two, three, four, five,
six...
Three, four, five, six.
Seven, eight.
Well done!
- And jump.
This is not a step. I can't do
this.
Govind, why aren't you
rehearsing?
You are dancing, who will watch
us?
Are you sure about this?
- Right!
Think about it.
I already did!
I think I hear the bell.
Bell?
Jai has this strange
theory but it's amazing.
What's the worst that could
happen?
Probably a slap or two!
Right! Life keeps slapping us...
We were slapped almost daily
when in college. - You mean you!
You know this is very special,
bro!
I can tell... she is special.
Do you know she is a
professor in a college.
No! I think this is too sweet.
Naina, you are very sweet.
- You're so sweet.
You are sweeter! - Shut up. -
Gayatri, here are some more
outfits.
You better decide what you
want to wear. It's too much now.
Mom, I can't decide, I
want you to do it, please.
I can't do it.
- This is beautiful.
Arjun, don't keep your
feet on the coffee-table.
Dad is calling you, come on!
Come on.
- Arjun!
Where does Sheila teach?
At ""Jamia Milia"". But why?
What does she teach?
- Urdu.
Urdu.
- Sheila teaches Urdu.
Good. But in which language?
English!
Great... now you should learn
Urdu.
Just a second...
Govind and Urdu, why?
Correct!
Correct!
- To hell with correct!
It's my wedding and you
want to hog the limelight!

an auspicious occasion.""

This stinks... it's pretty
but...see?
No, no I trust you.
- Me too, I think.
You can smell.
- No, he can smell. Smell...
Smell...
- Okay, just smell it.
It's horrible.
It's gross.
- Sort of.. - One second.
Hello.
- Hi, Naina.
One second. Hi Dhruv.
What?
- Nothing.
We're having so much fun.
That's great love.
When is the ""sangeet""?
Tomorrow night. And you have
no idea what we have planned.
I wish you were here.
- Well... you know...
I know you can't
make it because of work.
I understand, Dhruv.
Wow! Will you let me talk?
I'm in Delhi for a conference
and I'll be in Chandigarh
tomorrow.
I'll be there by noon,
understand?
Text me the address
and I'll see you soon.
Okay, smartie pants... good
night!
That was Dhruv.
He is coming tomorrow in time
for the performance. I'm
shocked.
But in a good way.
Yeah, of course, I mean... I
thought
he would make it to the wedding.
I'm just surprised.
That's great, right? Now he can
watch your world class
performance!
Oh no, I'm suddenly very
nervous.
I won't be able to sleep
tonight.
Come on, Jai, let's practice.
- Relax!
You will be able to sleep
and perform too. Just chill.
Trust me! Right?
- Trust him!
Why not?
- Trust him, I mean.
- Breathe... - Okay, okay!
'You will be able to sleep...
trust me!'
Idiot.
Now where's Gayatri...
It's me, Jai.
Jai, what are you...
What are you doing here?
I'm taking a walk, why?
But why are you all
covered up like a thief?
Because it's cold. Do you mind?
What are you doing here?
I was thirsty.
You had water? No go back to
sleep.
Go! Get lost!
- No..
I'm not thirsty anymore.
- Very good.
Very good, now go back to
sleep! Go!
But Jai?
Can't you talk
without screaming? Woman!
If you don't tell me what
you are doing over here...
I will scream like a mad
woman and bring down the house!
You better tell her!
Arjun... is that you?
Yes, it's me!
- Where is Gayatri?
Where are we going? What's this
for?
Naina, if you ask another
question,
you will be strapped to this.
You will be asleep and
we'll get some peace.
Get it?
but...
Sorry!
You're idiots! I
could hear you in here.
Why don't you take
morning tea to Alok too!
Sorry, Biji. Let's go?
No, I like being held
under house arrest. Let's go.
Gayatri, have you taken the
thermos?
Yes, Biji. Let's go?
Of course!
But where to go?
""I fell in love.""
""I fell in love.""
Use these yellow and white
flowers..
..to decorate the wall.
- Good morning, uncle.
Naina, where are you off to?
- I'm going to pick up Dhruv.
Good morning.
- Hi.
So, all set?
- Yup!
See you. Bye!
- Bye!
Where were you? Forget her.
We need to set the flowers.
Alok! Come on,
not the flowers for me!
Come on! The women are
finalising the jewellery and
sarees.
We are left with the flowers.
Come on. Quick.
Make it quick or Alok will kill
me!
Yes. We will do it. - Yes. We
have to decorate that wall too.
Yes, sir.
Madam, chair.
Thank you.
Hey partner...
Hey partner...
What's wrong? The train is
delayed?
No, a total delay.
Dhruv won't make it.
Something came up at work.
Ouch!
So are you waiting for the
decorator to show up with the
tent?
Come on... get up. Lend me a
hand!
I'm totally confused...
orange or white?
Yellow and white!
Yellow and white, sorry.
Come on... let's walk and talk.
So, do you also do this?
Make plans with your
girlfriend and ditch her?
Actually, that's Radhika's
nature.
Really?
Wow good! I'm glad,
here's to women's power!
Don't you feel hurt?
Do you feel hurt?
Of course, I do.
For a little while,
then I cheer myself up.
I think about all the good
things.
No relationship is perfect.
I guess you are right.
Nothing is perfect,
you get used to it.
I often think about the
direction..
..our relationship
is taking and then...
brain freeze!
So, it's best not to think.
Yeah... but you know Jai...
I've always believed that..
..our habits were once
something we could choose.
We have to choose right.
Interesting!
But let's say, just imagine...
..the choice is right..
..but what if a slightly
better option comes along?
Then?
Crazy!
Let's go and tell Govind.
The loser is still asleep.
Still asleep?
- Yes and it's one o'clock!
Let's throw water...
- Yes, water!
First water. And now, beer.
Arjun... you're not nervous
about getting married, are you?
Not really, why?
Because...
Let me have that.
Well if you have any doubts,
you can check with Govind.
He's done this twice!
Yeah man!
Starting today you are my best
man.
Just stay with me.
- Yes. I will.
You guys are devils! You
aren't invited for my next
wedding.
No problem, dude.
We'll attend the one after that!
Same old joke. Three
times a day! Like a routine!
Are you mad?
Just finish that.
What are you guys smoking?
What is it?
Think of it as a gift of
nature!
- Nature, huh?
He's getting married, he needs
it!
You guys are quite dangerous,
you know.
You want me to tell Gayatri?
- No, no way.
You've changed... everything
is,
'you want me to tell Gayatri?'
It's not rocket science,
just watch...
One, two, three...
Gayatri, I can't wear this!
What's wrong?
So what's the problem? You look
hot!
Arjun! I can't wear this!
Come on, you look good.
You're mad! I look like Santa
Claus.
What is their problem?
All they have to do is dance.
What's wrong with Santa Claus?
- It's all red!
What are you talking about?
- It's looking very nice.
Very nice!
You remember the steps, right?
Yes, every step. I
can't wait to dance.
I told you we were
going to have a great time.
Just look at you... matching!
Wow, this is fun!
I think I need to pee!
Come on guys! It's show time!
""Sound and disco. San
Francisco.""

Dhruv.
Wow, you look lovely. I made it!
My foot you made it!
- Why?
You missed the performance.
No... I caught the last part.
You were so hot...
so hot and I know you.
Let me introduce you to the
others.
- Okay.
Guys this is Dhruv.
Gayatri...
- Hi.
Arjun, congratulations guys!
Thank you.
- You must be so...excited?
Yes!
- It's like..
Just a second.
Jai...
Hey...
- Hi...
Too good, man. You
were amazing up there.
All thanks to you.
Thanks to me?
Yes, if you were here, you
would've been Naina's partner.
Oh that way, but let me
tell you, I can't do this.
Thank God for you!
That's true.
- Welcome.
Hope you enjoy yourself.
- Thanks.
Let me take you to Biji.
Okay.
- Take care, guys.
Bye.
- See you.
It's time to...
Bar. The bar is there.
The bar is..
Naina.
Naina.
Life can be so unpredictable.
Biji was so full of life and...
I can't believe she is no more.
Darling, I think..
..anything Arjun's
family decides will be okay.
But I think right now
you should be strong..
..at least for Arjun.
Gayatri, you should eat
something.
You should eat something.
I think you should.
I'll get something.
Hi Naina...
- Hi.
You okay?
- Yeah.
How is Gayatri?
I'll check on her.
Where is Dhruv?
- He is taking a shower.
Naina
..can I see you tomorrow
at six in the morning?
It's important.
Yeah... sure!
Bye.
You are late.
I know, sorry. I always
have a problem waking up.
The five minute snooze ends up
being more than ten minutes!
Sorry.
- I know that feeling.
So why did you call me out here?
Naina, I need to tell you
something.
What?
After Biji's death I
realised something...
life is too short.
Everything is here and now...
the chances, the moments.
And a delay won't change the
facts.
Yes, but...
- Now I hope he understands
this.
What's up? Why did you call me
here?
Arjun... don't postpone the
wedding.
Have you lost it completely?
At this moment?
Naina...I mean..
Listen to me, Arjun.
Do you think Biji would like
it if you postponed the wedding?
Of course not, never!
Biji always told us
that life is very short.
And that we should
celebrate every day...
..every relationship, the
love we share, our friends.
And this is your wedding!
She was so excited and happy..
..that you and Gayatri
were getting married.
Here... now...
I know it's tough, brother
but...
God knows I know.
Biji is with us.
She is here and she will always
be!
Make sure she is happy.
You know this is the
generosity and love of our
elders...
..even as they leave us
they expect us to be happy.
Do you remember in school I
always failed in English
spelling...
Biji would teach me...
after learning it herself.
But she always got it wrong.
I got Gayatri to meet
her before anyone else.
Without her how can I...
Exactly the
way she would want you to.
Happy and smiling.
Go and talk to Gayatri.
""Why do we meet when we
have to lose each other?""
""When heart has to wither,
why does it blossom?""
""Why do we meet when we
have to lose each other?""
""When heart has to wither,
why does it blossom?""
I'm so glad you did that.
Anything for Biji, Naina.
Her happiness is in this.
Why did you ask me to be here?
You know what it is to lose a
loved one and still carry on.
And I felt that if you are with
me,
I wouldn't be all alone...
Well actually...
- I know.
But I promise
whenever you need me...
..no matter what... if you need
me...
I'll be there...
silent but strong.
Sure?
Sure!
""Lord is the savior.""
""Lord is the savior.""
""Lord is the savior.""
""Lord is the savior.""
""Lord is the savior.""
""Lord is the savior.""
""Lord is the savior.""
Bye guys...
Bye.
- See you.
See you.
- Bye. See you.
Bye, Naina!
- See you. - Bye.
Shall we go?
Glad you made it. For a moment
I thought you're not coming.
Dhruv...
Take care, buddy.
- You too.
Congratulations.
- Thank you.
I'll get our bags.
- Yeah.
- Bye Jai. - Bye Naina.
If you ever visit Bombay...
Sure.
Dude, what's wrong with you?
Come on... cheers!
Cheers? For what?
Because we are free again!
Tell me, how was lunch?
And your mom?
Lunch.
It's too close to the kitchen,
do you have anything else?
This is too small, do
you have anything else?
I think this is fine.
Thank you.
What would you like to have,
aunty-ji? Some soup?
I'll have anything you call
for.
Your taste is the best.
Okay, no soup then.
One steam wantons without sauce
and a vegetarian noodles.
I don't like onions, carrots
and
mushrooms, so only add capsicum.
Yes ma'am.
What's up with you? Why so
silent?
China Garden is your
favourite restaurant.
Yes, mom, it is my favourite
but
Radhika is talking right now.
Idiot! Have you thought
about your wedding yet?
Come on, mom!
- Excuse me! - Yes?
Can I have one pepsi
with lots of ice. - Sure, sir.
Not aerated drinks again!
Excuse me, can you make
that an ice tea, please? Thank
you.
- And excuse me...
- Yes ma'am?
Please see to it that the food
is
very fresh and piping hot.
Sure ma'am.
And really hot! If it's not
hot, I won't accept it.
Excuse me, can you ask the
chef to use less ajinomoto?
Lunch! It ruined everything.
Any more questions, Mr. Govind?
No... so which restaurant was
this?
Govind... let's go
back to Chandigarh.
I can't get the wedding
out of my mind.
What are we doing here...
I mean what are we doing?
Bro, that wedding is over.
But more weddings will
happen I am sure.
But are you sure you can't get
the wedding out of your mind...
or is it 'someone' on your mind?
Do you think so?
I think so!
You know who?
You think I am stupid?
I know who! You want to know?
No!
So Jai is the guy from Delhi.
Stop it, Ritu!
I should stop it?
Okay.
I think you have a crush...
a little crush on him.
Dhruv still exists, you know.
He hasn't vanished.
Of course, that will be too
much to
ask. - Rubbish. You naughty girl.
Stop imagining things, Ritu.
The wedding is over.
I am back to my old routine and
he is back to his fun routine.
What were you saying, Jai?
Just a second...coaster..
..carry on.
Radhika, this isn't working.
What's wrong now? You want
to quit your job again!
No, this is not working.
You are frustrating me again.
What is 'this'?
This means us.
I am sorry. I know it's
coming like a surprise.
Why are we even together,
Radhika?
Because we want to get married,
Jai.
You want to get married or
do you want to marry me?
I don't understand... what
sort of question is that?
It may sound complicated but
it really is very simple.
At Arjun's wedding..
..I realised that though we are
together we really are far
apart.
It's because our priorities
are different.
Tell me..
..when was the last time..
..we really did something
together from our heart.
I just want to be honest..
.. that's it.
What are you getting at, Jai?
You mean the two years that...
I have invested into this
relationship are a waste?
Keeping track of your
21 family members'..
..21 birthdates and wishing
them is a waste?
Tolerating your annoying
habits is a waste?
Jai, to be honest, you are
ruining
my well laid out plan!
In the next two years I wanted
to have my first child...
now how's that going to happen?
Radhika, relax... calm down.
Probably the plan itself is
wrong.
I mean somewhere along the way
the plans scored over love.
But who knows... right? Perhaps
there's someone else for us...
Who will love us...
for the real reasons.
The right reason.
Someone else? You met someone
else?
I did!
But neither am I with her nor
is she madly in love with me.
There's no such thing like that.
She has nothing to do with
our situation.
I swear!
Have you told your mom?
She is sure to kill me!
I was hoping you could
break the news to her.
Coaster!
I guess you are right.
I mean, I am the strong type
but...
I thought something like
this would shatter me.
But I'm not.
Isn't that strange?
We could remain friends... I
mean,
if it's alright with you.
I need some time, Jai.
I'll call you.
Okay.
Jai..
.. if ever wish to pursue
the girl you've met...
please do it after you've
changed your habits.
It will create a good
impression.
- Hello. - Hi, busy?
Just working for the exhibition.
Any plans for tonight?
Just me and Arundhati Roy...
at the most some coffee.
That sounds exciting.
Don't rub it in!
I'll have you know, though I
may
not agree with her viewpoint but...
she is way more interesting
than ..
..your financial spreadsheets
and numbers...
with whom you spend every night.
Fine, let's change our plans.
Dinner.
Wow, sounds good.
- Tonight at 9pm. Don't be
late.
- Okay bye.
Weren't you afraid of her?
That was quite a risk.
I sure was but I figured that
it
makes sense to accept the truth.
As for risk, crossing the road
is also a risk. Isn't it?
Well that was it!
So Mr. Govind, now you and
I are in the same category.
Single... and officially
ready to mingle.
No, brother.
I don't belong to that
category anymore.
You know Sheila?
Sheila? God damn it Govind!
We are back in Delhi...
back to reality.
You took her number?
You basket, when?
What are you doing?
Come on bro, it's simple
technology!
FB... friend request.
I think I'll ask her
out for coffee today.
I think you should take
your sad story elsewhere.
I'm committed, man!
Committed my ass!
Being committed to the
idea of commitment..
.. doesn't mean you are
committed.
Have you lost it completely?
- Get lost.
Sheila? Facebook?
Loser.
- Give me a break!
Oh shit! Naina!
Hey Jai, how are you? Please
accept my friend request.
I want to tag you in
the wedding pictures.
Bye! Smileys!
Don't be silly! We were
all there at the wedding.
She wants to share the
pictures,
that's it.
Even I was there at the
wedding...
but nobody's sharing
anything with me.
Well Sheila is sharing...
her old age.
That was a good one. Let's
see the pictures.
Hey check out pinku... and
Gayatri!
Look at Arjun!
What now?
Now... back to work!
You like Naina, right?
Govind! Naina is with Dhruv
and she lives in Bombay.
Where do we live?
Jai.
Jai, we need to renew these
advertisement contracts.
Didn't you close the
endorsements
deal last time?
- Yes sir.
- Good!
So get ready, this time
you're going to Bombay.
- Here's the file. - Okay, sir.
Let's book your ticket.
- Hi... - Hello.
- Come... - Thank you.
So, I've ordered some wine.
The one you like?
Well done.
So, a dinner plan...
out of the blue?
Well, it has been a while..
..and there's something else.
What?
I'm leaving for Singapore
tomorrow for ten days.
- Great! - What?
That means you will
miss my exhibition.
Oh God! How could I forget!
I am so sorry... I feel so
stupid!
I have a very good reason for
it.
Go on!
The management thinks if I like
the set-up over there...
I could be the Vice President
for Emerging Markets.
Isn't that great?
That's great, Dhruv. I
am so happy for you.
You always wanted this.
- Thanks.
Don't worry about the
exhibition, really!
Will you marry me?
Your menu.
- Sir? - Thanks!
- Give us a few minutes? - Sure
sir.
Listen... I know that
everything
is happening very quickly.
But that's exactly how life
throws up opportunities.
I'll be back in ten days and
then you can decide...
the type of wedding, the
location,
the setting.
Toast?
Come on...
the future is about to unfold
with unexpected surprises.
Trust me.
Good morning, sir.
Have a pleasant flight.
Well, well... what could
have made my super..
..independent daughter
think of her mother?
Dhruv proposed to me.
He did? What did you reply?
Nothing.
What do you mean nothing?
He left no room for me to reply.
He was so sure I would
say yes that...
he didn't realise whether
I had said yes or no.
What's the matter, dear?
Aren't you happy?
I don't know, mom.
You know Dhruv and I have
been good friends.
I'm an emotional fool while
he is too practical.
I believed this would be a
good combination for us.
And that he would bring a sense
of balance to my life.
But now you know...
How did you know, mom...
that dad was the one?
Or uncle Ashu after him?
A sign, Naina.
A little sign and you will know
it.
You will feel him...
you'll feel that thrill that
just fills up your heart.
Mom, hold on a second. Hello?
If you ever visit Bombay...
- Jai! - Hi Naina.
Listen, I am going to call you
back!
Yeah, sure.
Bye!
Mom...
Idiot!
Call as soon as you land...
on the advice of a
two-time divorcee!
Jai... you are... fantastic!
Naina, just do what you've
always done in life.
Follow you heart, not your mind.
Trust yourself.
I know you will take
the right decision.
Love you, sweetheart.
I love you too, mom. Bye!
Jai... what are you doing in
Bombay?
Well... I thought I'd visit you.
Just kidding!
Work brought me here so I
thought
you could show me around Bombay.
I'm so bored here at
this guest house.
Your timing couldn't
have been better!
Really? My dad always
said my timing sucked.
How is that?
Well... my arrival into this
world
put an end to his honeymoon period!
Nothing has changed neither
you nor your sad jokes!
Please... before they
get any sadder..
- Coffee? - Yeah!
Thank you.
- Welcome, ma'am.
So, now your exhibition is
set...
anything else that's exciting?
Nothing actually. You know..
Gayatri's wedding was so high
on energy... You were there. -
Yes.
that now everything seems
lifeless.
I really get it.
I still sing those songs
in the shower and...
my mom thinks it's
a sign. Ridiculous!
Maybe it is! Is Radhika ready?
Not anymore.
We... we broke up.
But, why?
I've figured out a slightly
more perfect option, Naina.
Being single!
And to be honest, Radhika
and my future had..
..a question mark dangling over
it.
But my mom hasn't given up hope.
- You know how they are. - I
know.
I guess all mothers are
like that.
How is Govind?
Govind... he got himself into
an interesting situation.
Really? You mean, Sheila?
So what? A slap?
Not exactly...
Hello sir.
- Salesman?
- No, sir.
- Bank account?
- No, sir.
Sir, I am Govind, Sheila's
friend.
I'm not a salesman.
- You are Sheila's friend?
- Yes, sir.
- Well... in that case, come
in.
- Thank you, sir.
- Would you like some tea?
- Yes.
Vinod, a cup of tea, please.
What?
Nothing, sir.
Sit down.
Can I clean my gun?
Oh... yes, please.
How did you and Sheila meet?
We met at Arjun and
Gayatri's wedding.
Since then we've been friends.
Rubbish!
- Sorry?
Rubbish... dirt in the barrel.
Don't guns frighten you, sir?
Are you holding the gun?
No, sir.
- Then what's to fear?
No, sir. I mean there are often
articles in newspapers...
'Man shoots himself with gun.'
Fear creeps in when the
barrel is pointed at you.
In the army...
Vinod! Inform Sheila that a
certain
Govind is here to see her.
What are you doing here?
Nothing, sir.
Why are you creeping up
on me? - No, sir.
Are you alright?
Yes.
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.
Then what are you doing here?
Sir... view.
View?
- The garden.
What about the garden?
- Butterfly.
- Butterfly? You like
butterfly?
- Yes, sir.
Big one. - Yes. - Small one.
- Yes. - Red ones.
- All types sir.
- All types of butterflies.
You like butterflies?
I love...
- Butterflies... wow!
Hi...
Sheila, let's go, we're running
late. - Yes, come on.
Just a minute...
Is the coffee on a train or a
bus
that it will leave without you?
- No, sir.
- You will miss it?
Dad!
- Just a minute.
Sheila does everything
at her own time
We literally counted hours
before she was born.
She spent two years in
the second grade. - Okay, dad.
She will get married when
she thinks its time...
..it also takes a while
to understand people.
You get it? - Yes. - Do you
gamble?
- Sometimes sir.
Do you drink?
- Sometimes.
With guys?
Sometimes. - With guys?
- Oh no, no, sir!
I was married twice before.
To whom?
- To women.
Are you sure?
- Sir, you are welcome to check.
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. I love everything
about nature, sir.
I just want to have coffee
with Sheila, sir.
Okay, dad, that's enough!
Stop giving him a hard time?
Okay. That's it.
I am giving him a hard time?
- Yes!
He has been married twice
and he loves butterflies! - No.
No.
I am not giving him hard time.
Do you understand? Yeah. Okay.
Let's go!
Nine o'clock back home.
I'll make it, sir.
- I mean Sheila. Bye.
Okay, that's it, dad.
Bye, see you later. Come on.
Hey... see you later.
Okay, right, sir.
Come on!
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Your dad is quite
an interesting man. Nice.
I was just looked at my watch,
he
said we should be back by nine.
He said a lot of other things.
He said I do everything late.
- Right.
We'll be back late,
he'll understand.
- No, no... - Come on!.
- No. Really.
Oh, my God.
- Oh God! Butterflies!
It's too much pressure.
So when did they get back?
On the dot at nine.
This time Sheila finally gave
in.
It's amazing love makes
people do amazing things.
Yup.
11 o'clock tomorrow?
11? Oh, yeah. A tour of Bombay?
- Exactly!
Exciting. Alright, I'll see you.
Text me when you get home.
Jai, this is Bombay. Don't
worry.
Corrected again!
- Pink butterfly!
- Garden butterfly!

Have you wondered why your
previous
two marriages ended in a divorce?
Okay.
Suchitra and
I were classmates.
Back then I was in a band...
I was big John Travolta fan.
- Really?
you know 'Saturday Night Fever.'
Oh, how did if he's your love.
Dad said the same thing when
he...
learnt that Suchitra
was a Christian.
There was a lot of drama and
we ran away from home.
Jai sneaked out with his
dad's car and drove us.
We got married in the church
as well as the temple.
I was 23 and madly in love.
Anyway...
Then?
then we turned 24
and started thinking like
adults.
We didn't work out. And she
left me.
After that I was quite low
and working for my dad.
My dad manufactured ball
bearings.
You know...those small round
things
that are used in bicycles.
I guess throughout school
and college...
I was ridiculed about balls.
I mean, my dad was the
ball bearing guy.
My second marriage was like
a life insurance plan. - What?
Nandini, daughter of wealthy
guy.
Sweet girl but very boring.
We were so incompatible that we
hated spending time with each
other.
We would invite friends over..
..so we could avoid
spending time with each other.
That bad?
I decided that enough is enough.
Good for you..
Exactly!
I left home again and started
living in a rented place.
Now I'm earning 84,000
rupees a month.
Post tax.
- I see.
I mean, I'm responsible for all
the mistakes and wrong
decisions.
It's amazing!
What have you decided now?
Well... since this train isn't
going anywhere, let's go...
walking.
Okay. Coffee.
- Coffee. - Come on.
- So let's take it slow. - Sure

Naina, is absolutely right.
You are not like other girls.
Be a man! Stand up for yourself.
I mean be stern in life...
what's that word, Naina?
Confront. - Confront! Confront
all of them who have..
..broken your heart into
a million pieces.
Ritu, go on, be brave!
Sorry... don't you eat anything
apart from ice cream?
Come on, go for it!
- Okay.
Hey.
You?
- We!
Yes, I..
listen Bheem.
Bheem?
I just want to say, what
if I eat meat and eggs?
What if I have a couple
of bottles of vodka?
A couple of bottles?
Only sometimes, dude. Sometimes.
At the end of the day
I am a good person.
Bheem, what's going on here?
And I know the Hanuman Chalisa
too!
- Very good. Very good.
Father, it happened three years
ago, we were in college.
Yes, right but it's over today.
Finally I am dumping you,
never to get back again.
Bheem, shut the door!
We'll help you.
Very good, Ritu!
Thank God. I am actually good.
Now to the next one.
What are you doing here?
Honey bunny, is it the ice
cream?
Who are they?
Sorry... just carry on.
Yes, carry on.
He is not really...
I know! And I thought there
was something lacking in me.
It's alright. - Well...
technically you were lacking...
Okay, no over confidence.
One more to go.
Let's get the hell out
of here right now.
I guess God heard my prayer.
He's not at home, let's go.
Ritu!
- Yeah, I am getting it.
Ritu? Where have you been?
I called you so many times.
You neither take my calls nor
reply to the text messages.
That's true.
Sorry. Ritu, why didn't you
tell us?
You are doubting him
unnecessarily.
Look at his innocent face.
He could never cheat you.
- Cheat?
That's true, Ritu.
His eyes reveal his honesty.
He won't betray you.
Betray? What are you talking
about?
I had seen your text.
- Text?
Priya's. I'll see you soon.
Hugs and kisses!
Kunal.
See that... I was right!
You are Priyanka, right? - Yes.
Cheat and betray!
You don't get it, Priyanka is
my..
Priyanka is my?
I don't want to hear another
word!
Guys like you always take
girls like us for a ride!
Was it wrong that I love you?
Are you done? I love you too!
Can I say something?
Priyanka is my cousin.
That's right. He's told
me so much about you.
It's not good to doubt like
that.
Kunal, I'll leave now.
We'll also leave...
No, Naina, you and I
will leave. Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I am so happy for them, Jai.
So let's celebrate!
Just a second.
Timing.
Hello... yes, Riddhi.
What?
But... how...
I can't believe this.
What happened?
No.
I lost the venue for my
exhibition.
Some confusion about
the dates and now...
I can't even reschedule
my exhibition.
So change the venue!
Jai, this is Bombay and these
venues aren't easy to come by.
Mumbai.
Listen, I've got an idea.
Wait for my call.
I'll be right back, okay?
Jai, one second... hello?
Mr. Fix-it?
Yes?
What do you mean,
wait for your call?
Relax, I'm here, aren't I?
Jai..
..what's this?
Trust me, Naina.
All we need is a little more.
""My heart is singing a song.""
""When you are with me,
my heart is tempting me.""
""Look, you should be
in your senses.""
""Tell your heart to keep quiet.""
""The air is vibrant.
Conversations are fragrant.""
""The weather is so warm.""
""Why do we fall in love?""
""If you know, tell me.
I don't know.""
""Why do we fall in love?""
""If you know, tell me.
I don't know.""
You are right! All we
need is a little more.
""I don't know.""
""What is love?""
Thank you, Mr. Fix-it.
You are welcome.
By the way who calls
pani-puri golgappas?
Sorry, it was a mistake.
It's a Delhi thing.
Right. - Shall we eat? I'm
starving..
it's three in the morning.
Even I'm hungry. - Sorry.
- I've put in the hard work too.
Right... I forgot!
We'd like two servings of
gol...
sorry, pani-puris.
Pani-puri!
Let's have pani-puri?
Three servings of pani-puri!
Hey... there's a queue.
Relax dude!
Jai, don't mess with them,
we'll go somewhere else.
She is right. Next time let
her mess around with us.
Forget it.
What did you say?
Just go away, okay!
Jai... stop it!
Jai!!
I'll give you a piece of my
mind.
Jai, stop it. Stop it.
I give you a chance.
- Jai. Jai.
Is this good? Is
this also a Delhi thing?
Naina, they were talking shit.
Right, it was shit. Jai,
you could've ignored them.
Sometimes I just don't
understand what gets into you
guys.
A small thing and
you lose all control.
A small thing? It's
not a small thing, Naina.
And people who treat
this as a small thing...
should be slapped right and
left!
Because they are responsible
for encouraging such behaviour.
You think you'll
change everyone, Jai?
Yes, Naina, I will.
Merely complaining
about things doesn't help.
Then you should slap me too.
Oh God!
What happened?
Jai, look... how cute...
probably alone.
What now?
Let's wait, probably
someone will come.
I don't think anyone is coming.
Are you thinking the same
thing that I'm thinking?
I'm afraid I'm thinking..
..the same thing
that you're thinking.
What do you say?
Let's go.
Oh my God! What do we call him?
Starving Starvo!
How about Lucky?
That's a nice name. Lucky.
Lucky.
Okay, Naina, I should get going.
Hold on, I'll be right back.
He fell asleep... sit!
Naina, it's okay.
Not a word. Come on.
Better?
I'm sure it would be if
it were on the right side.
Then why did you make that
sound?
- Because it's cold. - Really?
Drama queen!
I feel better. I should leave.
I guess I'll call you.
I guess you will.
Jai, lunch?
I would love to but I have
an important lunch meeting.
Really? I forgot you
even have to work.
Something like that.
Is it interesting?
Well, it is nice to
see you again, Jai.
And it's really nice
to extend this contract.
Thank you, sir.
How are things?
Sir, D Decor is doing fantastic.
We are launch more
products next year,
so we're really excited.
Should be excited,
it's all about quality.
D Decor's quality and designs
are the best. So, thank you.
Thank you.
How did you get hurt?
Some guys said something
about a girl last night.
You fought for a girl?
Is she your friend?
Yes.
A special friend?
I think so.
Does she know that you
think she is special?
No, sir.
Why? You haven't told her?
It's complicated, sir.
It's always complicated.
Jai, relationships are
only as complicated...
as you want them to be.
Remember this, in real
life and in films...
there's always a happy ending.
So, tell her what's in your
heart.
Where is she?
Actually, she is right behind
you.
She's like a little monkey.
Hello...
You better tell her or
you'll repent it all your life.
Take care buddy... see you.
Ma'am... pleasure.
Thank you... so much!
It's okay.
Thank you God for fulfilling my
wish.
Ritu will die of envy!
Naina! I didn't know
you were this filmy.
I mean it's cute but --
Listen, of course I am filmy.
By the way, 99 percent girls
who
meet SRK react in a similar way.
Right.
- He's just so charming.
Don't wash the hand, by the way.
Of course, I'm not
going to wash the hand.
Listen, haven't you watched
DDLJ?
I have but it has been a while.
So what?
Nobody makes a love
story like Shahrukh Khan.
We're going to watch it right
now.
No, Naina... - I can't
watch DDLJ, I promise! Oh God!
What unexpected rain!
Seriously! I think my watch
stopped.
What is this? You made a mess
again?
What is this?
- Not really.
Really? Look at this!
Here take this towel.
Here.
Dry yourself before
you pour out your anger!
Look at this... it says Bura
[Bad] Kebabs, not Bara [Big].
You want jumping chicken?
No!
Take your pick...
there's Chinese, Indian...
Nothing exciting.
Now what?
Do you know how to make
the perfect Maggi noodles?
Heat water, add the noodles,
let it boil for two minutes.
That's obvious my friend.
You also add cheese..
..chilli and my special
ingredient.
Is that so?
Tell me Sheila... you are
beautiful,
intelligent, funny...
and you know how to make
the perfect Maggi noodles.
I don't get it... you
can get any guy you like.
So how is it that you
still aren't... married...
The marriage question!
I was waiting for it.
This I don't get...
I mean, as soon as a girl is
born..
..you start thinking
of getting her married
It doesn't matter whether it's
through an matchmaking website
or...
the nephew of a neighbour or
through a distant relative.
Get her married off so..
..the parents feel
they've fulfilled their task.
What's with everybody
wanting me to get married?
There's a lot more to life than
that.
You were married twice,
what did you get?
True!
Thank God I didn't
give in to the pressure.
My logic was simple.
When I'd meet someone who's
outlook was off center like
mine..
..I would, you know and
you know what, I was right.
Well, I'm very happy to meet
you.
Wait. The secret ingredient!
Fried noodles?
- That's right!
In 'Maggi'?
- Yes. Try it.
Oh my God!
This is so good, I
think I want to marry it!
Hi Jai...
- Hello Naina.
Oh shit!
- What?
Sorry, I'll call you back.
Okay.
Hi Jai...
- It's Gayatri, darling.
Who is this Jai you were
expecting?
Gayatri? When did you get back?
Don't tell me you're set to
make me an aunt in nine months!
Shut up! I'll become an
aunt after you get married.
So is it Arjun's friend Jai?
Oh my God, Arjun was right!
About what exactly?
Just that there was some
connection between you and Jai.
It's not like that, Gayatri.
But you can make it like that,
Naina.
Dhruv proposed to me, Gayatri.
You know Jai and me...
..maybe in another lifetime.
Anyway, you know... just a
second.
It's your life, honey. Think
about it.
You want me to talk to Arjun?
Gayatri, it's Dhruv.
- Hi. - Hi.
- I'll call you back. - Okay,
bye.
What are you doing here?
- May I come in? - Of course,
come in.
Seven days are more than enough
to fall in love with Singapore.
Got done with my work and came
back.
When I landed I remembered
that...
I had forgotten my key back at
home.
So I had to come. I
would have called you. But..
What the hell? Why is this dog
here?
It's not a dog, Dhruv, it's a
puppy.
His name is Lucky.
A puppy is also a dog.
Where did you get it?
On the street, she was alone.
And you brought it home.
Naina, I am sure he
has 200 infections.
She!!
- Alright, she!
You are over reacting, Dhruv.
I'm not over reacting,
you know my allergies.
I have to take a shower.
Fine, you take a shower
and I will go to the studio.
I'm taking Lucky along.
I'll see you in the
evening and we'll talk.
Yes.
- Hi Naina... - Hi Jai.
Can I leave Lucky with
you for a few hours?
- Sure. - Thank you.
Everything alright?
Yes, I'll call in the evening.
Okay?
- Okay. - Thanks. Bye. - Bye.
Lucky, today I want you
to prove lucky for me.
Come on. Let's go.
Lucky, be my lucky mascot today.
So you will ring the bell.
Jai?
Dhruv?
Lucky... with you?
Well, Naina...
Naina gets everyone
involved in her social service.
Anyway, come on in.
So, can I get you something to
drink?
Coffee, beer, Bacardi?
No, thanks, Dhruv. Thanks a lot.
Hey babe, guess who is here!
Jai is here with Lucky.
Hi Jai.
- Hi Naina.
Actually, sorry, I should've
called.
That's not a problem.
Give me a second, I'll be back.
She's a little frisky, but
don't worry, I've fed her.
Thank you.
- She should be fine.
I guess, I should leave.
You just got here.
Yes, but I came to Bombay on
business and now it's over.
I should prepare to return.
You know what, spend
the evening with us.
Naina, I forgot to
tell you earlier that
I've invited some of my friends
over.
Now what? - Now we have to
organise dinner and drinks.
Why don't you invite
some of your friends?
Jai, you must stay, it will be
fun.
Thanks, Dhruv, but I should
leave.
No problem.
- Naina, he's your friend, tell
him.
Please stay, Jai.
Come on, guys. Let's play.
Each team has two players.
One player has explain the word
written on the top of the card.
So that's simple.
No, not simple.
The five closest
words used to explain...
that word are at the
bottom of the card.
And you have to get your
partner guess that very word...
without using those five words.
Ready?
Wait. I'll explain.
Say the word on top is Ritu.
The five words below is will
be...
- irritating, child, ice cream..
..silly and gorgeous.
So smart, Dhruv.
Let's get started. Now come on!
Naina, I think you
should partner with Jai.
But Dhruv --
But he doesn't know anyone.
He only knows Lucky and he
can't play.
And Ritu and I will referee,
okay?
Okay.
Okay, come on quick. Hi... I'm
Jai.
Okay guys, your time to starts
now.
Okay, Riya...
when we were in school...
your teacher ask you to
do this but you couldn't.
Maths?
Something else, come on...
Science!
Add them altogether, more...
Studies.
Okay, on to the next card.
You have this for your
breakfast.
Cereal.
No, something else!
Eggs. - No, not eggs,
something else, come on.
Okay, Scotch.
Whiskey!
- Move out of alcohol. Scotch.
I don't know.
- Time is running out guys!
Come on, Riya!
- Next!
Taxi?
Luggage?
Bags... where we first met.
Bus stop... bus!
Right! Okay this is very simple.
I said yellow and you said
orange.
Decorations... wedding...
flowers!
Right! Okay, go down.
Boxes?
- Jai, emergency!
Hospital.
- I'm here, aren't I?
Art gallery!
- Right! Okay.
Was...
Father.
Times up! That's a strange
clue but amazingly played.
Wow.
Well played guys, the
others still can't believe it.
Naina, dessert?
Yes, I'll come.
- Jai, join me for a smoke?
Yes. Come on.
You know, investment
banking is very stressful and...
to take the right decision at
the
right time can be very difficult.
Just like life.
And that's how I got this
habit of social smoking.
I get it, Dhruv. Sometimes
even I do it, bad habit, bro.
Yeah, what do you do?
I'm in marketing.
- Family?
Just mom.
You aren't married, yet? I
mean..
Well, even you aren't married.
Yeah, I guess didn't get
the time. What's your excuse?
I guess, I didn't get the right
girl.
Dhruv... they're
leaving after dessert.
Is this right?
What?
- Dessert plan!
Yeah.
- We'll leave too and we'll
drop you.
Good idea.
- Yeah.
Let's go.
Alright, Jai. It was a
pleasure meeting you again.
Stay in touch.
Bye Dhruv, all the best.
""There is loneliness.""
""I don't know why.""
""Why this punishment?""
""Who knows?""
""Paths are lonely.""
""Arms are lonely.""
""Eyes are lonely.""
""Why do we meet when we
have to lose each other?""
""When heart has to wither,
why does it blossom?""
""Why do we meet when we
have to lose each other?""
""When heart has to wither..""
So that was a fun party.
Thank God, you had the spare
keys.
Thank God! Alright, Dhruv, see
you.
Naina, hold on.
What have you decided?
About what?
Destination or local? Big or
small?
The type of wedding, my love?
You always wanted to have a
beach wedding, didn't you?
Yes. I knew it, you know me so
well.
Before I forget...
Naina, surprise! We're going
to Singapore for the weekend.
Dhruv, but...
Don't worry, it isn't the final
move.
You just have to come
and finalise the house.
Don't you think this
is happening to fast?
Why so scared? We'll be fine.
I'll see you.
Bye.
- Bye.
""Why do we meet when we
have to lose each other?""
""When heart has to wither,
why does it blossom?""
Loser! About time you called!
Yeah... how are you?
I'm doing great. Absolutely fit!
I guess Sheila is the reason.
Coffee, Sheila and I...
it's amazing, dude!
Caffecino, frappecino, latte,
black coffee.
Tell me, are you in love
with coffee or Sheila?
I mean, both!
I am so happy for the
both of you, brother.
So how've you been?
I'm alright. Packing
things to come back.
Coming back? How is Naina?
Naina... is fine. She is with
Dhruv.
Anyway, I'm taking the night
flight tomorrow. So, see you
soon.
Jai, did you tell Naina
how you felt about her?
Govind, I've got to take this
other call. I'll call you back.
See you in Delhi soon.
""Look. Look.""
""Things have changed
completely.""
""You were graceful.""
""I was not.""
""Heart was blossoming.""
""Those eyes filled with love,
and sweet talks.""
""I don't know where it is lost.""
""Why did my dear one go away?""
""Why did we separate?""
""Why do we meet when we

""Paths are lonely.""

""Eyes are lonely.""
""I don't know why
there is loneliness.""
""Why this punishment?""
""Who knows?""
This one is better, it has A/C.
Arjun! Govind!
So champ, game, set, match?
What are you doing here?
You're in a bloody problem
and you can't even tell us?
What problem are you talking
about?
Everything is fine.
Bloody liar!
Naina and Gayatri are like
sisters.
And Gayatri shares everything
with me.
You really thought we wouldn't
know..
..what's going on
between you and Naina?
There might be
something between us but...
..there's something
between Dhruv and Naina too!
Let's not complicate things.
In the same way that you
and Radhika had something.
You had realised this
a long time ago that...
you and Radhika aren't
meant for each other.
That is why you
weren't confused about Naina.
But Naina realised this only
after she spent time with you.
She needs time.
But what else can I do?
What do you mean, what else can
I do?
Tell Naina the truth!
If you don't tell Naina the
truth..
..your life will be
one big compromise.
And every girl you date
will always be second best.
He's right, Jai.
You remember what Biji would
say...
Have the courage to
say what's in your heart.
And be willing to understand
what's in another person's
heart.
So, do this for Biji.
Just go for it, buddy!
You think she'll say yes?
Jai, Naina and Dhruv are
going to Singapore today.
So you really don't have time
to
wonder and ask stupid questions.
We should get going.
Let's go.
- We have to go!
Let's go.
- Come on!
Okay, I think we should. - We
better make a run for it, let's
go!
Ritu, I hope you could be...
I am hopeless.
I've checked that
the flight is on time.
Shall we go? I'll call the lift.
Naina, you're sure
you want to do this?
Yeah... I can't do this to
Dhruv.
""Why do we meet when we
have to lose each other?""
""When heart has to wither,
why does it blossom?""
""Why do we meet when we
have to lose each other?""
""When heart has to wither,
why does it blossom?""
""The paths are lonely.""
Jai.
- Come on, they've left...hurry
up!
Slow down, dude.
It's Jai who has to talk to
Naina,
why are we running? - Listen.
""There is loneliness.""
""I don't know why.""
""Why this punishment?""
""Who knows?""
Dhruv!
Jai?
Do you mind if I speak with
Naina?
Sure.
If ever in the future
and no offence to Dhruv..
..you have the perfect option..
..and you also realise it...
..can we go for it without any
fear?
Do you think we can hope..
..that no matter how confusing
and irritating relationships
our story could turn
out a little different.
Jai...- This is the
right time to take a stand...
This is the right chance.
All I need is your answer.
That's it.
Jai is crazy.
He thinks even guys should
be decked up with henna.
It's because of him that
we ran out of henna and...
it's also because of him..
..that Gayatri's henna
ceremony was so much fun.
I danced a lot today after ages.
There's still more...
I'm back after the wedding..
- I'm back after the wedding..
..and everything seems so
different.
Life seems incomplete, as
if I left something behind.
I even turned my bags upside
down.
I guess the change isn't about
things and places, it's about
me.
Gayatri was right, and
perhaps so was Ritu.
The change is Jai.
How I wish I had met Jai years
ago!
I'd have all the
courage and the liberty..
..to express my feelings to him.
But Dhruv...
..he is a part of my life..
..and I'll have to face him.
What will I tell him?
You silly girl!
The truth, first to
yourself and then to me.
Naina, you and I were always
friends.
It was much later that we
decided to be with each other.
But it doesn't mean
the decision was right.
I wanted to tell you, Dhruv...
but... it all happened...
A little too quickly, right?
I get it... I get it.
Jai, I saw this diary the
day I met you at Naina's place.
When I spoke with Ritu..
..she told me what I
probably didn't want to hear.
And then that evening
you spent with us, Jai.
Sorry, Naina, but I
had to see it myself.
I've got used to looking out
for you.
Jai, do you remember I'd said...
to take the right decision at
the
right time can be very difficult.
Just like life.
Well, this decision
isn't an easy one.
But it's very
important for all three of us.
On that note, I have
a flight to catch.
Naina, I didn't book a ticket
for you, so don't worry about
it.
I love you so much, Dhruv.
I love you as much, Naina.
Now, you guys take care of
each other.
Yeah.
You are a great guy, man.
Take care of each other.
See you.
Naina... I...
Couldn't you have said this
earlier?
Naina, I...
- Naina, I... what?
Tell me it's a Delhi thing!
You didn't hear your bell?
Naina, I love you very,
very, very much!
I swear!
I have never heard a louder
bell!
I swear!
Hey baby... yes, it's done. Bye.
""Your wishes will be
fulfilled.""
- I love you too!
I love you more.
You are right, brother.
- ""Know that dreams come true.""
""I am thinking this is
where I want to be.""
No.
""Beloved, I am yours.""
It's my diary.
""Understand what the gestures
say.""
""Listen.""
""Everybody is calling
to us from the heart.""
""I am thinking this is
where I want to be.""
Life is complicated, people.
Try to keep it simple.
Settle down with a
like-minded partner...
and be happy... simple!
Jai make it quick... first
time I'm meeting your mom.
Oooops not so simple
Coming.

conversations make me go crazy.""
""With you I think I'll be
alright.""
""Oh, yeah. Sometimes one
wrong can make a right.""

Aashika wakes up frightened in a hospital and goes into a flashback. A group of friends - Prem, Jacks, Diya and Vivek - decide to travel to Mumbai to celebrate New Year's Day. While travelling, a patrolling cop halts the car and interrogates them on the account of driving under the influence of alcohol, to which Prem bribes him into letting them go. That night, they encounter weird situations and a baby's cradle, which they avoid. Prem accidentally hits a car; while figuring out who they hit, they come across a man who warns them to back off or else they will all be killed. The friends try to take the man to the cop they bribed earlier, but find the cop brutally murdered. The man suddenly disappears.

The friends sense danger and find a way to get back off the road but the road, seems to be endless. They encounter a girl and offer her a lift. The friends assume that she's a mental patient and try to take her to a hospital. Leaving to find the asylum in the jungle, they leave Jacks in the car with the girl. Jacks is murdered. Prem and Vivek later come out of their car and have an argument. Splitting ways, Vivek discovers an abandoned house where he gets brutally killed by the mysterious girl. Prem, Aashika and Diya are now the only survivors. Prem orders the girls to stick together but a scared Diya runs away and gets killed. Scared, Prem and Aashika run and Prem ends up in a graveyard. He witnesses his deceased friends' souls and gets killed by the girl.

In the present, Aashika in the hospital finds out about the girl from a nurse. The girl's name is Poonam. She visits Poonam's house and witnesses Poonam's husband's and mother-in-law's souls. The mother-in-law explains that Poonam was eccentric and wanted a child. She argued with her now-dead husband for a child and her mental condition worsened after her delivery. The doctor advises Poonam's husband that she needs counselling. It is also revealed that Prem and his friends crashed Poonam's car and killed her, her husband, and her child. Poonam returns as a ghost and swears vengeance upon the friends for murdering her child. Aashika was only saved because she was pregnant with Prem's child. Aashika's parents call her and reveal that her child was aborted. This angers Poonam, and she kills Aashika.",2293,NA,NA,NA

But, can you think of a reason

This place is beyond reason.
This is Bakrapur.
O' Lord!
May the Lord bless you
with his grace.
How are you?
May the Lord bless you
with his grace.
May the Lord bless you
with his grace.
How is business?
- Good.
My Lord!
May the Lord bless you
with his grace.
O' Lord!
Don't hoard.
Share what you have.
You can't take it to your grave.
You brought nothing.
You'll take back nothing.
Right?
Let's drink to it.
May the Lord bless you!
Not a penny more.
But the deal was for 3000!
3000 bucks for incense?
No. I was talking
about Shahrukh.
Suraiyya finalized
everything with Mr. Usman.
Fine, take a seat.
Come on, boy.
Zulfi, are you dreaming again?
Memorize the entire
lesson by tomorrow.
Yes, teacher.
Concentrate.
No more mischief!
Keep studying..
Suraiyya!
Suraiyya!
Greetings, Ms. Nooran.
- Greetings.
I was on my way to the city.
Did you arrange for the money?
He left for the city just this
morning, along with his uncle.
I will somehow get the
money to you by evening.
I guess you aren't
tired of making excuses.
But I am tired of
listening to them.
I bought imported
shoes for myself.
I'll elope with you in a trice.
I see.
- What?
I've things to do here.
That's why I say
talk to your father.
I'll treat you
like a movie star.
Star!
This cheap mobile
that you bought me
can't even take
decent pictures.
Forget the mobile.
I'll bring you a
laptop this time.
The big one.
One with a camera.
Listen.
- What?
Naaz.
How about a kiss?
Don't laugh.
Have you seen yourself
in the mirror?
Asking for a kiss!
- I have. I look nice.
Naaz. What are you doing?
- Who was that?
Listen, I need to get going.
I am not done yet.
Are you still there?
- Coming, mother.
Cut your crap, I have to go.
Mother's here. Goodbye.
- Naaz..
Why don't you all just kill me?
I was working, mother.
I hope you didn't get blisters.
An incompetent husband
and two good-for-nothing
children.
There's just no end
to my problems.
What the heck is that?
- Mother, must be a bee..
Please go inside,
I'll be with you.
Come soon.
- Yes, mother.
Naaz!
Zulfi!
Zulfi!
Hey, hot shot!
What's wrong with you?
Zulfi!
Why so sad?
Say something.
- It's nothing, Mr. Jaffer.
Nothing?
Then why do you look
like a sacrificial lamb?
Zulfi!
I was looking for you.
Wait.
Get on my bike.
How can a man be so stupid?
Suraiyya. Is it my fault
that Usman's mother-in-law
broke her back?
No, it's entirely my fault!
It's my father's fault!
For getting me married
to a penniless man.
And what was the point
of you going along?
You two are just useless.
Teach her some manners.
If she continues
yelling this way
we'll soon rot in inferno.
Right. Just sit here and rant
about heaven and inferno.
A woman has to do the chores
as well as amass money
by selling eggs and hens.
The men of this family,
lazy to the core!
Arrange for the money somehow.
Otherwise, I'm going
back to my mother's.
I won't stay here
a minute longer.
Come in, Mr. Munna.
I am free.
Come in.
I want to style my hair.
Is Mr. Jaffer in?
Greetings.
- See you later.
Go on in.
- Take a seat.
Ever since you returned from the
city, business has been slow.
Everyone asks for Jaffer.
And for free.
Father, why be sad?
They come here
because they've faith in me
as I've learnt
new techniques.
How can I charge them money?
In fact,
I should be paying them.
I'm getting a chance to practice.
Look at this new style.
Shall I teach you?
- Shut up! What faith?
A beggar asking for alms
is happy with what he gets.
They are here for freebies.
- Father.
Yes.
- Chill, dude.
How about I thrash you..
- No, no, remain seated.
Haven't you finished yet?
Just a little longer.
I see.
- Yes.
What are you doing here?
I was running an errand
for my mother.
You know,
I soaked henna yesterday.
Come tomorrow,
and we'll apply it together.
And, is everything okay?
Naaz.
What are you doing here?
Come on, go home.
Your mother's looking for you.
Didn't you hear it?
Go home.
I am going, there's no need to yell.
Go on. Go home.
Did he have to drop in now?
Greetings.
- Greetings.
No, no.. Leave.
Majid,
you were really brave today.
Give me a smoke.
Zulfi. What do we do
with your hair today?
What style would you like?
Aamir? Salman?
Or Shahrukh.
- The children these days..
What can a poor mother
do all alone?
Majid wants to get romantic.
But his wife's just
not playing along.
Go ahead, make fun of me.
Can't help it when
I'm ill-fated.
Are you Majid?
Yes. Is something wrong?
Is Suraiyya home?
Suraiyya..
She is.
Let's go.
Mother.
- Yes.
Mother. They are here!
- Who?
Them! - Them?
- Yes.
Your father didn't exactly
leave behind a fortune!
Tell them I'm not at home.
Go on.
But, mother.
They met father on the way.
Oh God! I'm tired of this man!
Go on, I'm coming.
Yes.
Is everyone here?
Start collecting.
Shakuntala!
Vidyavati.
Saraswati.
I hope you're making
sure their payment's right.
Mallika.
Yes.
- Is it all there?
Greetings, ma'am.
- I see.
So, you're finally here.
That's not it, ma'am.
Why wouldn't I come to meet you?
I won't be fooled
by you anymore.
And your leader, Nooran..
She's been taking your side.
- No, ma'am.
I visit her on your behalf.
Ma'am, my circumstances
are such that..
It's no secret, everyone
knows about my situation.
Zulfi's father's aunt, who
lives in Sultanpur, fell ill.
I wonder what sort of
an outbreak it was
and half my poultry
succumbed to it.
And then..
- Stop.
In the last three months
you haven't paid the
loan or the interest.
Ma'am, try to understand.
I swear on my child.
I'm not lying.
The circumstances..
Just give me a little more time!
Look, Suraiyya. All these
women have repaid their loan.
If you don't repay
the money in a week
I will stop everyone's
loan in this group.
No one will get anything.
See that. Helping you has
landed all of us in trouble.
What do I say?
I was honestly coming
to the office to pay you.
But just then, Mr. Usman's
mother-in-law broke her back.
We're in a lot of trouble..
You should've thought
about it before.
I explained the rules
in the beginning.
Didn't I?
- Yes.
Look, Suraiyya.
If you don't return the money
in a week, then be ready
to face legal procedures.
Everyone!
Let's go!
Hocus-Pocus!
Abracadabra!
Run away!
Leave this kid alone!
Go!
Go away!
Ma'am, the kid's being
haunted by a spirit.
But don't you worry.
I've chanted a strong mantra
and got rid of it.
Here.
Make him wear this
in the morning, after bath.
Everything will be okay.
May the Lord bless you!
What's wrong?
Why are you upset?
Have you eaten
or are you fasting?
No..
Why would he fast?
All the villagers
are humiliating me.
And all you two care
about is stuffing your mouths.
I want the money
before Thursday..
Otherwise, I won't
stay here a moment.
Spare me!
How can we get
the money so soon?
Who will lend us the money,
uncle?
Of course.
Who will lend you the money?
The only one who could,
gave you his daughter instead.
Mother, I am hungry.
- Why did you bring him inside?
Naaz, take him outside.
- Come in.
Don't worry, I know a way.
What is it, uncle?
Tell me.
Don't worry,
we'll get the money.
Where will we get it from?
Is there a lottery running
for mendicants now?
Stop taunting me.
I was talking about Shahrukh.
- Shahrukh?
I can never make
sense of what you say.
The animal fair of Malshapur
is quite popular.
We'll take Shahrukh there.
Many buyers come there.
We'll get a good price.
Usman offered better
than that, for sure.
You're right, uncle.
Zulfi, catch the ball.
Zulfi. Could you not have
caught the ball?
Oh God!
The Lord had
answered my prayers
and blessed me with a son.
And now, he's gone as well.
Uncle. I looked everywhere,
but Zulfi's nowhere.
Oh God! My son.
He's just a child.
Where can he possibly go?
He didn't go alone,
he took Shahrukh along.
What were you doing?
Uncle, they left quietly.
Even that animal
didn't make a sound.
Stop crying like a girl!
My son!
I told you not to call.
Everyone's so worried.
Sweetheart, I'm worried too.
In your love.
Listen. I had a wonderful
dream this morning.
You and me, by the seaside.
It was beautiful.
Naaz..
Naaz. Why are you crying?
What's the matter. - Zulfi ran away
from home.. - What?
What are you saying?
When did this happen?
And, with Shahrukh.
Hey!
Wonderful.
Everyone's worried back home
while you two
are having a ball.
And, with biscuits.
I knew this is where
I would find you.
You know,
when father would beat me
I too would hide here.
It's a nice place, right?
Listen, let's go home.
No, I don't want to go home.
Where else do you want to go?
- Take us to the city.
We will work with you too.
Come along,
and bring Shahrukh too.
He will make for a great barber.
Shahrukh that is..
Let's go.
We'll go to the city later,
let's now go home.
Can't we stay here until Sunday?
What's on Sunday?
They're taking Shahrukh
to the Malshapur fair that day.
So, you want to hide
here till Sunday? - Yes.
Great.
What will you do next Sunday?
The fair's just once a month.
- You're smart.
What will you do next month?
I don't know, Mr. Jaffer!
Just take us along.
I don't know, Mr. Jaffer.
Come along with me.
You've my word
that nothing will go wrong.
We'll go to the city too
tagging Shahrukh and you along.
Let's go home now.
- Why did you run away?
Do you know how worried we were?
If you ever do it again,
I'll break your limbs.
That's great, ma'am.
That's a nice way
to teach him a lesson.
Break his legs.
- I don't like saying it either.
A child never understands
a mother's heart.
May the Lord bless you
with progress in your work.
Work's good, ma'am.
Just bless me so that
I find a nice bride.
That's it.
- Of course.
Any girl would be
fortunate to marry you.
I see.
So, sir..
Are you sure about
the Malshapur fair?
Yes, I..
- There's no other choice.
These children have
never had to starve
so, they will never
understand our condition.
They will have to understand,
ma'am.
The food's begging to be eaten.
But, the boy's still stubborn.
Fine. You want to starve,
don't you? Then go ahead.
Zulfi. Don't infuriate me.
Mother. Leave him alone.
I'll console him.
Oh my!
You never cared so much
about your mother before.
Why, mother?
Can't I console him?
He's my brother after all.
Yes, he is.
I am the only enemy
in this house.
You two can do anything
you want to. Just spare me.
I don't have the will anymore.
Mother's just impossible!
Zulfi. Get up.
Come with your sister.
- No. I don't want to go.
Hear me out.
Let's go sit outside.
- Leave me alone, sister.
I said, don't be stubborn.
Come along. Come on..
Come on.
Mother's always scolding him.
And he isn't eating either.
Talk to him.
Who is it?
- Here.
Zulfi.
- Mr. Jaffer!
So, why aren't you eating?
No, I don't want to eat?
Why?
They are taking Shahrukh away.
Don't you want to save him?
Yes.
Then do as I say.
Go inside and finish your meal.
And come, meet me an hour later..
At the old fort,
along with Shahrukh.
And, don't tell anyone about it.
Understood?
Do you attend school?
Yes.
Why?
Read this aloud.
What's written..
Alif..
Laam..
Zulfi!
Are you going to take
that long to read it?
Tell me now.
What's written in it?
Lord!
It says Lord.
That's it.
Now,
only Lord can save Shahrukh.
How?
Like this.
""A mighty goat escorted
by two courtiers.""
""A mighty goat escorted
by two courtiers.""
""Appreciate the irony.
Indulge in the ruckus..""
""Be it the household merchandise,
the prices have gone sky high.""
He won't even give 10 kilos of meat.
What are you saying?
Nothing less than 4500..
- That's too much.
2500 is all we can give.
2500 is too less.
Go find someone else.
11,000!
- 11,000!
How about 3000?
4000 is too much!
That's not possible.
It's a fine goat.
Take a look.
How much?
How much?
- 5000!
Quote reasonably!
He's stuck at 5000!
How much did you offer?
- Leave him.
How much did you offer?
- 2500.
Let's settle for 3500.
That's it.
Give me at least 4000.
- No, 4000 is too much.
Hear me out!
Just 500 more.
We've brought him from far.
Even I have to go a long way.
Let's settle for 3500.
That's it.
Fine. How much are
you willing to offer?
3500, that's it. Nothing more.
Greetings, sir.
Greetings, lad.
What brings you here?
Nothing, sir.
A friend of mine from the city,
lives here.
So I came here with him.
That's good, lad.
How are you?
How are you, Shahrukh?
So, you're leaving us
today, right?
Fine, hand over the rope to me.
I've got to leave.
Just 500 more.
I'm offering you
a reasonable price.
Okay, like you say.
Sir.
How much did you sell him for?
3500. He's sold, at least.
What do you mean?
You sold an animal worth
3 to 4 lakhs for few thousands.
3 lakhs?
- He's a prankster.
Always playing pranks.
- I see.
Don't listen to him.
He's not covered with gold.
- Right.
He's better than that,
sir.
He's blessed with
the grace of the Lord.
Don't joke about this.
What? What are you saying?
Be clear, what are you saying?
You're a mendicant.
How could you miss this?
- What?
Look here. Carefully.
Here.
This. Take a good look.
Look at the crescent shape.
Have you seen the
Mecca-Medina calendar?
You must have.
The crescent shining,
on top of the dome.
It's the same thing.
You're a wise man.
And you didn't see it either.
You didn't go on Haj, but
you've a world of experience.
Don't you?
It's true.
- Yes.
Child, it says Lord.
Hail the Lord!
My service has been accepted.
He's an angel, child.
Don't sell it.
- This is no ordinary goat!
I don't care.
Just handover the animal to me.
I'll be on my way.
Don't call him an animal.
He's an angel.
Apologize to him.
We didn't take any
money from you.
So, I am not refusing to pay.
Take it.
Didn't we make a deal?
Look.
My nephew's not so wise.
Look. We don't want to sell it.
Just leave. - Leave..
But, uncle..
- Dear, didn't you see that?
It's Lord written on him.
We cannot sell him.
But, uncle,
what will we tell Suraiyya?
We cannot set foot in
the house without the money.
Henpecked husband!
Don't you understand
what Jaffer's saying?
Lord is written on him.
- Yes.
And, a Sheikh from Saudi
paid 52 lakhs
for a similar goat.
52 lakhs!
52 lakhs.
- 52 lakhs?
He took it home on an airplane.
Airplane?
Of course.
It requires special permission
from the government.
But, how do you know?
I read the newspaper.
And I can show you
the news as well.
Even the kids from
Delhi's Jamma Masjid area
know about it.
Do you want to read it?
Child, even I've heard
the Jamma Masjid story.
Indeed.
- Let's take him back.
He's been blessed
by the Lord!
How could I trust that man?
He's good for nothing.
I wonder how father spent
so many years with you.
Yes. We'll see.
How your husband tolerates you!
Mother. Father's back.
Didn't I tell you?
This man isn't
capable of anything.
Stop.
Stop right there.
Listen. Listen to me..
Why don't you try
telling our creditors?
Maybe, they will listen to you.
I'm trying to speak.
Let me speak!
Look, dear.
Shahrukh' s no ordinary goat.
He's blessed by the Lord!
He's special.
He's our golden goose.
Are you two drunk?
You could've brought
me some poison.
God forbid.
Explain it to her.
Suraiyya.. You tell her.
He's right, ma'am.
Jaffer says Shahrukh' s
not worth a few thousands
but he's worth millions.
And,
if we can find an Arab merchant
he will definitely
pay millions for him.
And, the story about 52 lakhs is
famous in Jamma Masjid. - Right.
Even the kids know about it.
Right?
I see.
Tell her.
- Yes, tell her.
He's right.
- But, what is he saying?
Child, you're the educated one.
Why don't you explain it
to me?
Ma'am, an angel
has descended in your home.
Take a look.
Look at the crescent formation.
Have you seen the
Mecca-Medina calendar?
You must have. The crescent
moon, shines atop the dome.
It's the same thing.
Right?
- Yes.
Yes.. It's something.
What do you mean by something,
ma'am?
It's time to celebrate.
That's alright, child.
But, what about the creditors?
Loan!
Stop worrying about them, ma'am.
What's the amount?
- 3000!
3000! Come on now, ma'am.
Here you go.
What's he doing?
How can I borrow from him?
Take it. But..
- I.. I'm family too.
I mean.. I am not an outsider.
Just take it..
- What!
Ma'am. You can return it once
you find an Arab buyer.
With interest.
- Yes..
Let's get him some water.
- Let's get him some water.
Ma'am, a golden goose.
Come.
Brother,
you'll get a chance too.
Don't worry.
Everyone will get a chance.
God's watching over everyone.
Everyone will get a chance.
What's going on here?
Yes, come forward.
Get the blessings.
Keep the money.
Yes.
O' Lord!
Wear this talisman, in the
morning after your bath. Okay.
Goodbye.
Keep moving.
All in line.
- What's going on?
Don't interfere.
Come on. Keep moving.
Put your money in this.
Take the blessings..
- What's this?
It's the grace of God.
Let us work, leave.
The Lord will bless you!
O' Lord!
Keep coming.
This way.
Come on.
Slowly.
Put the money in here.
My beautiful, gorgeous Suraiyya.
Each time she decks up,
my heart skips a beat.
I'm totally fed up!
I should..
Listen to me. I'll just
wait for five more minutes.
I see.
Five for you and five for me.
How about me coming
in 10 minutes?
10 minutes?
I'll grow old in 10 minutes.
Would you still love me
if I get grey hair?
I will still love you.
And, if your hair turns grey,
I'll paint it black.
I'm an expert at it.
Right, painter.
By the way, painters command
more respect than barbers.
I see.
- Of course.
Just imagine,
Jaffer Super Barber.
Hair-cutting, massage,
and all that.. All free.
I see. You've been getting
too bold these days.
Aren't you scared of
your mother any longer
that you're being so audacious?
Wait, I'll come right now
and teach you a lesson.
I..
I..
- Okay.
Who do you think you are?
- Sorry.
By the way,
where's your mother?
Doesn't she ask you..
Naaz, where are you?
Naaz, where were you?
Only if she gets some
time off from Shahrukh.
By the way, Shahrukh' s a little angel.
- I see.
Tell me something.
Don't you think
we should get blessed by
Shahrukh' s grace as well?
Why?
Don't you think,
the mark on Shahrukh
is a stamp of Lord's
approval for our love.
Right?
Isn't it?
You see..
We meet so freely these days.
What are you thinking about?
- No. Nothing.
Right?
- Yes. You're right.
There's a dialogue from actor
Shahrukh' s movie..
If you want something
from your heart..
The entire universe conspires
to unite you with it.
Or something like that.
Shahrukh' s a part
of our world too.
So what if he's a goat.
Right?
Universe.
You're talking about the universe!
- You touch me a lot these days.
You're getting audacious.

Greetings, Majid.
Greetings.
You look really nice.
I guess sister Suraiyya's really
pleased with you these days.
It's the grace of God
that he sent Shahrukh to us.
With a little contribution
from Suraiyya as well.
Mr. Jamal, you should get a share too.
- How?
Because your son
spotted the goat first.
Mr. Sohail
my son can spot
all the problems in the world.
Except those of his father.
Don't say that, Mr. Jamal.
- It's true, Majid.
Not at all.
Mr. Majid,
the police is at your home.
Police?
- Yes.
Go on.
- Let's go, child.
Suraiyya. Are they here
to take Shahrukh away?
Can't you ever think positively?
Better be ready for
what's going to follow.
Whose goat is it?
- Who made the money?
Whose goat is it?
Tell him.
Whose goat is it?
We never cheated anyone.
Please don't arrest us.
- Yes.
I never said
that I'm arresting you.
We thought so,
looking at your uniform.
He is Legislator
Syed Suleiman's brother-in-law.
He's opening a new showroom
in the city.
He was really impressed
by your goat.
Send him over on the
day of the inauguration.
Lotan.
- Yes.
Send the jeep in the morning.
- Yes, sir.
Greetings, sir.
Are you on your way?
Of course, we've made
all the arrangements.
Okay.
I think the minister's tied up
with something important.
No, that's not it.
He's on his way.
And,
I don't see your brother-in-law.
He's with the minister as well.
They will be here.
I see, so Mr. Suleiman's
with the minister? - Yes.
That's good.
This is the right opportunity to show
brotherly love. - Are they here?
They were held up
by a punctured tire.
I don't want to hear anything.
Arrange for another car.
He should be here before
the minister arrives.
Yes. Yes, sir.
Is there another guest of honor
other than the minister?
No, that's it.
Long live..
- Minister.
Long live..
- Minister.
Long live..
- Minister.
Congratulations, Mr. Rizwan.
How are you? - It's all
your grace, Minister.
Hello, Minister.
You too, Singhania.
You never like this ambience.
Things change with time, sir.
And, when you're personally
visiting my area
then, it's my duty to attend.
Rizwan, hurry up. The minister's
got other engagements. - Yes.
I was supposed to attend
a cabinet meeting.
But I made it clear.
I am committed to Mr. Suleiman.
I can't attend the meeting.
Of course, you've to please
the alliance partners.
It's the law of
coalition politics.
Pass me the scissors.
Let's not delay this
auspicious event.
Just a few more minutes.
Is it the auspicious hour?
- No, no, just..
Here they are.
- Them?
Come..
You've planned a sacrifice.
Honestly, Mr. Suleiman
I don't get the
time anymore
but I really miss your
homemade kebabs.
No.. That isn't the case.
It's for warding off the evil eye.
- I see.
Come.
Please..
Look.
You're taking the Lord's
angel out for a stroll.
You sneaked him out, didn't you?
People keep coming to see him.
No one lets me play with him.
That's a problem.
You should be thankful
that he's still alive.
We haven't yet been exposed.
Can you believe it?
I am waiting in a shady village.
For a bloody goat!
I swear.
I'm going to blow a fuse.
But you can't argue
with your boss, right?
Can you?
Hello! Hello?
Are you there?
Darn! Network!
Icing on the cake.
Ma'am, please sit down.
Be patient, he'll be here soon.
Get some cold sherbet for ma'am.
Yes.
- No, it's okay. Thanks.
Can I tell you something?
It's about Shahrukh.
You know, he was born
right before our eyes.
It was a peculiar night.
Strong winds blowing..
Storm..
Heavy rains..
Lightning struck
in our courtyard.
And right then,
Shahrukh was born.
He's the angel of God.
A miracle of nature.
Wow! Sounds straight as
if from the twilight zone.
See, he..
They are here.
They are here.
Ma'am. They are here.
- Come quickly.
Come on.
Come, Zulfi.
Bring Shahrukh.
Come on, son.
You've been playing in the mud.
Madam. This is Shahrukh.
Look at this.
He is Jaffer. Jaffer.
You can tell him too. He lives
in the city, just like you do.
Child, what was that..
That cup..
- World cup.
Yes.
- Cricket World Cup.
Cricket.
She's here to pray for them.
Yes, ma'am.
I understood everything.
Myself Jaffer, hair-stylist.
In town.
Hi!
The texture of your
hair is really nice.
Thanks.
Sachin. I'm a huge fan of him.
Sachin's a client of our agency.
- I see.
In fact, our agency handles
half the Indian team.
What are you saying?
Minister Rawat spoke with
our boss, about Shahrukh.
So, our boss decided that
Shahrukh' s going
to bless all the jerseys
and kits of all the players.
That's great.
He's the lucky charm
of the Indian team.
Right. Of course.
By the way,
Shahrukh' s got scope.
In fact, he can endorse
local brands. Right?
Money's money after all.
Yes. Money's money after all.
Yes, ma'am.
Money's money after all.
""The game begins""
""The game begins""

the ghat of Ganges..""
""We met a man by
the ghat of Ganges..""
""Upon inquiring,
it said it's India.""
""Waiting with patience..""
""Waiting for the opportunity..""
""Waiting for the opportunity..""
It is not going to
be easy this time.
We need to play the
communal card carefully.
They have also chosen
a candidate from our own.
Votes are bound to be split.
So be prepared.
It will be tough. All of you
will have to work hard.
Mujibur Rehman has a good hold
on this area. - Indeed!
We will have to do
something to ensure
that our votes
don't go to them.
Mr. Suleiman,
do you have any solution?
Yes. I have.
Here it is.
Hello.
- Hello.
How is your goat?

""The votes are being asked for
in the name of the Lord..""
""The goat shall reign

You kept insisting on coming.
Jaffer is here.
Jaffer. Jaffer.
Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.
Ma'am,
how did you come here today?
She wanted to go shopping.
You know I hardly have the time
to spare, from household chores.
She kept pushing me.
And now it's raining.
It's raining, ma'am.
I'd come for some salon work.
It was raining,
so I thought of shopping.
Yes. Why not? It's your
age to enjoy. Let's go.
Ma'am, are you hungry?
Let's eat something.
No. No. Do you get any
hygienic stuff in this city?
No. No. Let's go.
- No. No, ma'am.
What are you saying?
Of course, you get.
Tea. Tea is not unhygienic.
We can drink tea.
I will take your word for it.
Let's drink tea.
Hurry up. Come on.
Ma'am, can I come under the umbrella?
It's raining. - Yes. Come on.
""We can communicate
through our eyes.""
If not for you
we wouldn't be
where we are today.
What are you saying, ma'am?
God has done all of this.
I am just a medium.
That's true. The tea is still
not here. - Hey! Bring tea!
You know what they have come from the village.
They are my close acquaintances.
They have journeyed for 1.5
hours to taste your strong tea.
Isn't it good?
God should fulfill
one more wish of mine.
I should find a suitable,
employed boy.
He should always
keep my daughter happy.
Is that so?
You know what ma'am
my father is also
worried about this.
That we should find a girl.
You are right.
Yes. But he worries
without a reason.
I have told father many times,
ma'am
to look in the village.
That there is no shortage of girls.
That we will find someone.
Ma'am, you also look around.
You will find a boy.
Right?
- Yes. We will see.
The party won the elections
because of Shahrukh.
Mother.
How do I look, mother?
- Very pretty.
My sweet mother.
Mother, will you buy me
gold bangles on Eid?
I have been telling you
for so long. - Yes. Fine.
Save some money for
the motorcycle too.
Motorcycle?
- Yes.
We have to take
Shahrukh to the city.
A motorcycle would save time.
And we will earn more.
Right, Majid?
Yes.
No. It's not important.
Why?
- Okay. Fine.
Don't be so greedy.
Be patient.
Let's finalize the soap and
biscuit deals for Shahrukh.
Then we will see.
Motorcycles and airplanes.
Suraiyya!
Suraiyya!
Two-wheeler or three-wheeler?
- What?
Let's buy a bicycle.
Not in front of the kids.
- Henpecked husband.
Hello.
Everything is fine?
- Hello.
Yes. We are
managing somehow.
My Shabbo is getting
engaged next Friday.
I need some money.
Ask the lady at the NGO.
Now we don't owe them anything.
Where do I go
when I am in debt?
You have never differentiated
between Naaz and Shabbo.
Help us out.
That is fine. But you can
see that we barely manage
to make both ends meet.
It's difficult to
spare anything.
Tea.
Here. A 500 rupee note.
Give me the change early morning.
What is this Rs. 500 for?
Should I tear it?
I should have the change to
give you. Right, Jamaal?
Go and check.
- Pay me later. It's okay.
Why are you inviting
my curse early morning?
Have I ever had tea on credit?
- Let it be, priest.
He does not know how to speak
to a person of your stature.
Here, take this.
Get going.
God will bless you.
What will the Lord bless me with,
priest?
Our goats are hardly messiahs.
Only fit to be cooked and eaten.
- You always joke.
Whose car is this?
Jamaal, seems like a big shot.
Is it the real Shahrukh?
Maybe, he wants to get
clicked with our Shahrukh.
It happens before the
release of a new movie.
Where does Shahrukh live?
- Yes.
Yes. Come.
Who is it?
Can someone tell me
where Shahrukh lives?
Shahrukh?
- Who are you?
Everyone calls me the priest.
Shahrukh belongs to our family.
My name is Rayeez Ahmed.
- Okay.
I am Saudi Sheikh Abdul
Rehman Bakhtiyar's PA.
Saudi?
Praise the Lord!
O' Lord, thanks a lot.
Come..
Another treasure-trove.
- Come.
Have tea.
- No. I don't drink tea.
So shall I get something
cold instead?
Go and get a cold drink. - Yes.
- No. Thank you.
Do you know Mr. Pandey?
- Mr. Pandey?
Mr. Pandey.
His company PML Consultants
manages your
Indian cricket team.
The lady with the kit.
- Yes.
Yes. We know her very well.
We were discussing our
new company logo with him.
What logo?
- Nothing.
Actually, Mr. Pandey advised
Sheikh to use
Shahrukh' s photograph
for the logo.
Yes. - Mr. Sheikh said,
not just the photograph
he would buy Shahrukh.
- It's good.
Can I see him?
- Sure. Look. Come. Look.
Zulfi.
Zulfi, move.
Zulfi,
show it to Mr. Sheikh yourself.
Wow! Wonderful.
Good.
Good.
He is an angel.
We were facing tough times.
But now, we earn no less
than Rs.20,000 a month.
Sheikh is coming
to India in a month or two.
We will finalize everything
when he arrives.
A month or two?
- Will it take so long?
A month or two.
A merchant paid 52 lakhs for
a goat in Delhi. - 52 lakhs.
If the Lord wills,
our merchant will pay more.
Yes.
You see,
there is only one angel.
If there is another buyer, the
price can increase too. - Yes.
No. I am just telling you.
You talk to him.
Yes.
Will you see him off
from the door?
Invite him in.
Come, let us go in.
Come.
- Please come.
Come on.
- Come on.
We will talk inside.
- Let's have tea.
What a change in two weeks,
sir!
What prosperity!
- It's a boon. - Here. Eat.
Ma'am, I was thinking..
- Don't think.
Majid, I was thinking..
I will ask Mr. Sheikh
to book my ticket for Saudi
along with that of Shahrukh.
He is used to this place.
Who will look after him there?
I thought I would accompany him.
- Can't my husband do that?
I am thinking about
earning 50 lakhs.
But if my husband also
accompanies Shahrukh
I am sure they pay goatherds
not less than the officers here.
Am I right?
And when you go there, find
a suitable groom for the girl.
After that, we will go on Haj.
Did you hear that?
You will go abroad.
All thanks to this kind fellow.
Yes, ma'am.
Hello, Mr. Swaran.
- Hello.
Where were you?
I haven't seen you in a while.
I had gone on a pilgrimage
with my wife.
Okay.
What did you ask from God?
No need to ask.
- Why?
I found out on my return.
It's his divine play.
I will leave now.
- Okay.
Take this, Shanti.
She is working so hard.
Let Sheikh come.
She will go to Saudi
and live like a queen.
Wear this after a bath.
Everything will be fine.
How are you?
- Sir?
All is well.
How is the boy doing?
Come on, go.
Go!
God made my
pilgrimage successful.
Great!
Where were you for so long, sir?
You were not to be seen.
I returned yesterday.
- Okay. - From my pilgrimage.
As soon as we came back,
my wife urged me
to check on my grandson's
wellbeing.
What is the news?
When is the Sheikh coming?
What?
- 55 lakhs is not a small amount.
Since a long time,
I wanted to buy some land.
But you know.
Property prices are rising.
And our earnings
are at rock bottom.
Now all my hopes
are pinned on the child.
What is this about your child?
As if you begot the goat.
His mother might belong to you.
But his father is
from our family.
We have a right.
We do have it.
Am I right?
What father? What right
are you talking about?
My Kalia is Shahrukh' s father.
- Kalia?
What new story is this?
Majid. - Yes.
- You were there.
When Kalia and your goat..
What is her name? - Salma.
Yes. Salma.
When Kalia and Salma united.
Disgusting. Even after
undertaking a pilgrimage
you don't have the sense
to talk in front of women.
Why? What did I say? All of
you were at the vet's clinic.
When Kalia and Salma united..
- Stop it.
Both of you just keep
listening like useless fellows.
He is talking nonsense in
front of your wife and daughter.
And both of you just keep quiet.
Nobody came when we
were cleaning the goat feces.
Now everyone wants
a share in the 55 lakhs.
She is right. Mind your tongue.
Fine. Fine.
Let's settle the money issue..
Look, Shahrukh is ours.
- His father is ours.
And 55 lakhs are ours.
- Yes.
Hello.
- Come. Come, Shyama Prasad.
God bless you.
Come. Take the offering.
Come, Shyama Prasad. Come.
How are you?
- Fine.
Everything is fine? - Yes.
I have some good news for you.
Is it that you have become
a father for the sixth time?
You always tease me.
- Tell me. What is it?
I have brought
someone to meet you.
He could be our trump
card in the elections.
Sir, touch his feet.
He is my elder brother.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
Whom have you brought,
Shyama Prasad?
Sir. Sir, it's enough.
- Shyama Prasad, you are..
Come. Stand up.
He is Swaran Singh.
He is from my village Sirauni.
Mangori and Sirauni are in the
vicinity. He is like my uncle.
Come to the point,
Shyama Prasad.
The thing is that
magical goat Shahrukh..
The one that cost us
the municipal body elections.
The father of the goat..
It's Kalia, right?
- Yes, Kalia.
His name is Kalia.
He belongs to Swaran.
How is this relevant?
Sir,
if the father is a Hindu..
How can the diabolic
lay claim on the goat?
Now you see the relevance?
What about the Arabic
lettering on his body?
What about the Arabic lettering?
Sir,
so what if there is no symbol?
But his blood is of a Hindu.
You can get the
medical test done
in front of the whole village.
- We can do that as well.
The child will clear the exams.
Make the offering. Leave!
How are you, priest?
- I am fine. Hello.
Hello. Is Suraiyya at home?
- Yes.
Shall I call her? Suraiyya. Suraiyya.
- Yes.
How are you, Suraiyya?
- Fine.
With God's grace, we've
repaid all your money.
What brings you here?
Isn't this Shahrukh?
- Yes.
It is so adorable.
Ask, sir. You can ask
for whatever you want.
Come. Come.
- Yes.
Come. Come.
Don't be scared.
He is God's messiah.
Give whatever you want.
Keep it.
Suraiyya, he is the bank manager.
Gupta sir.
All the accounts of
our NGO are with his bank.
He has come especially
to meet you guys.
Hello.
Pleased to meet you.
These..
These are the account
and fixed deposit forms.
You can't keep 50 lakhs at home,
can you?
We don't have 50 lakhs.
No. You will get it.
Look, ATM
locker, fixed deposits,
net banking
phone banking..
You will get all the facilities.
Without charges.
How are you, Majid?
- Fine.
He is Suraiyya's husband.
Hello, sir. Pleased to meet you.
Myself Vibhuti Bhushan Gupta.
Manager of BMZ bank.
Why are you panting?
The village council
has summoned us.
With Shahrukh.
- Oh Lord! Why?
I don't know.
Chief, we are waiting
for your decision.
It's a clear-cut case.
How come?
We raised him like a child.
And today,
people are laying claim on him.
You did it for your benefit.
Otherwise, you guys
would have sacrificed
him on Eid.
- Sir, hold on.
Chief, understand one thing.
It's the question
of our religion's honor.
If the need arises,
we will move the Parliament
leave alone the Supreme Court.
Get that straight.
So what are we here for?
So what are you waiting for?
As far as the truth of
Shahrukh' s birth is concerned
Majid has also confirmed it.
Why don't you speak up, Majid?
What? - If you need more proof,
if you want more truth..
Check with the Sirauni
veterinary hospital
about Shahrukh' s bloodline.
We don't know about
Kalia and Salma's ancestors.
If a Catholic comes
in the future
and we get to know that
they are Christian by birth
it will complicate
the matter further.
Another thing.
There is no greed in us.
Because Mr. Swaran
has promised
that he will donate more
than half the money he gets
to the Goddess's temple.
Glory to the Goddess!
- Yes. So what's the big deal?
On the first day itself,
Majid had said
that he will give more than half
the money to the
mosque and school.
You are behind all this?
Look, chief and gentlemen.
This sacred symbol
is the proof of our claim.
So the money earned from him
will be used in the
name of the Lord. - Yes.
Our Gods will have
to go empty-handed?
Because of a symbol..
Lord! Lord!
Lord!
Glory to Lord Shiv Shambhu!
Lord Bholenath.
It's Lord Bholenath himself.
What happened?
- What are you doing?
I will offer my head to Goddess.
If anyone swears
on Lord Bholenath
and says that this symbol
is not Bholenath' s trident.
What nonsense!
- Glory to Lord Shiva!
Glory to Mahadev!
Say, glory to Mahadev!
Glory to Mahadev!
- Glory to Allah! Glory to Mahadev!
Glory to Allah!
- Allah is great!
Glory to Allah!
- Allah is great!
Silence. Silence.
Silence. Silence.
What is this?
Is this a council or a joke?
Glory to Allah!
Glory to Mahadev!
It's a complicated matter.
So the decision can't
be taken in haste.
So..
The council has decided that
until the Sheikh comes here
or some other
decision is taken
Shahrukh will remain
in the council's custody.
Chief.
- And neither of the parties
will exercise
their right on him.
This is the council's decision. Enough.
- Chief, he is our child.
We don't accept it.
- It is the council's decision.
Silence.
The council ends here.
All of you go. Go home.
We don't accept your decision.
- It is our goat.
It is our goat. - It is ours.
Allah is written on it.
Come on. We won't leave.
We won't accept it.
- Silence.
Naaz,
I have told you so many times.
Don't call me
while I am working.
What is going on?
Nothing.
Everything will be fine.
When?
And how will it be alright?
Such things happen
in the council meeting.
Don't be afraid.
Nothing will happen.
Nothing will happen?
This betrayer also
had to show his color now.
We don't even know whether
he is a Hindu or a Muslim.
That's not true.
He is a messiah.
The entire village
accepts his powers. Right?
So what do we do?
Nothing will happen.
Don't worry.
I will do something.
Look,
you will have to do something,
Jaffer. You don't understand.
Or else..
What will happen of us?
Everyone is burning
with jealousy.
The things they said
in the council meeting.
What happened?
The shopkeeper has
refused to take eggs. - Why?
He says these are infernal eggs.
- What?
He said those who eat
them will incur a curse.
They will be born as
Muslims in their next birth.
All are scoundrels.
Let it be. Don't worry.
We have made the arrangement.
We have found a solution.
Got it?
We are trying to
call up the Sheikh.
Once he finds out, everything
will be resolved. - What?
What? Are you crazy?
You want to ruin everything.
- Give the phone back.
We have to call up Mr. Sheikh.
What are you doing?
Get the phone out. Get it out.
You have burned the phone.
Majid! Majid!
Majid!
Hello, Majid.
- Hello.
You know that assembly elections
are round the corner.
The party has
always stood by you.
This time you have got a chance
to show your loyalty.
If you had got money
from the Sheikh
and the people had
not been confused
by the trident symbol claims
we would have had
great expectations from you.
But seeing your situation
we have fixed the
amount of Rs. 25,000.
Rs.25,000? - Rizwan has
especially instructed that
Shahrukh' s absence
doesn't matter.
The priest's hands are blessed.
So we are to take
the money from him.
Chief, I was saying that you
have still not found a solution.
We have to pay for
Shahrukh' s upkeep every day.
So.. - Why?
Until now you have enjoyed
Shahrukh' s earnings.
Swaran Singh is waiting
with cash in hand.
He is ready to pay
for Shahrukh' s maintenance.
If that weakens your case..
- No, chief.
Our child is not a burden on us.
We can afford to
take care of him. Yes.
Chief,
don't worry about the money.
Feed him well. Feed him well.
Majid, there is a call
for you at Shastri's place.
What?
- Call for you.
Okay.
- Bye. Bye. - Come on.
Pick it up..
Hello.
Yes..
This is the priest.
Yes.
Who?
Give it to Majid?
Majid is unwell.
He has diarrhea.
Yes.
Mobile?
It got burned.
Yes. Okay.
What? Yes.
Bye.
Hello.
Junior Sheikh was very angry.
With great difficulty he got
the number from
the telephone exchange.
What did he say?
Sheikh is coming next week.
What?
- Yes.
The council members
will have to be quick.
To heck with them!
Even if they declare
Shahrukh to be a Hindu
Sheikh would still not care.
Who better than
Sheikh to spot a messiah?
The Quran originated from there.
Am I right, priest?
Let's go home.
- Yes.
Come on. Come on.
- Let's go.
Hello, ma'am.
Sir..
I am also there.
Hello, priest.
- Hello.
Are you going somewhere, ma'am?
Yes, child.
I am going to my mother's place.
It's better than
going to prison.
Prison?
What are you saying, ma'am?
I have brought sweets
for all of you.
I have got a job in
a big salon in Mumbai.
That's great news, child!
Child, take me along with you.
- Yes. Everyone can go.
I am here to get
beaten by the police.
Police?
What's the matter?
Sir, what is the matter?
Mr. Sheikh is coming.
Now what to do?
We can't stay here.
But why to leave the village?
What if he finds out
Shahrukh' s truth?
Shahrukh' s truth?
That his father Kalia
is a non-Muslim.
Now they are saying, he is
the incarnation of Lord Shiva.
Trident. God forbid.
Who knows what decision
the council will take, and when?
Priest, that's a good thing.
What's the worse
that will happen?
Mr. Sheikh won't take
Shahrukh with him.
The matter will end.
It's good.
Yes. And then we
will go to prison.
Why prison?
Sir, the claim not being
proven is not an offense.
But not returning 50,000
is a crime, isn't it?
You took money?
We asked for an advance.
And he immediately agreed.
Ask them where the money went.
Ma'am, where is the money?
Only Rs. 5,000 is left.
- What?
Forget that.
No one cared for me here.
You hardly will, when
I go to my mother's place.
But where did such
a hefty sum go?
The party workers took
away half as donation.
Okay. I am going.
I won't stay here.
Come on. Pick up the bags.
Pack your bags.
Yes. Go to the city.
Fine. If this is the matter
let's leave together.
What?
- What?
Yes. Come on.
Why is it taking so long?
Where are they?
Did that boy run away again?
Where will he go?
As it is, Shahrukh is not..
Don't take that wretch's name.
We are in trouble
because of him.
I am sure something is wrong.
- Yes.
Why are you worried?
He will come.
What do you mean?
We need to get away.
You don't understand. - We will
leave. Everything will be fine.
With God's grace everything
will be fine. Don't worry.
Look, a vehicle is coming.
- They are there.
Stop. Pull over.
- Look. Get up.
See whose vehicle it is?
It's ours!
Come on. Let's go.
Pick up the bags.
Pick it up.
- Has everyone come?
Come on.
- Let's go.
The luggage.. Ma'am,
all of you get into the vehicle.
I will load the bags.
Okay.
- All of you sit comfortably.
Okay.
- Sit. Sit. Come on. Let's go.
Wait. - Why are you sitting
in the front? Let him sit.
Priest.
- Come on.
You sit.
Ma'am, I am there.
Let him sit. We youngsters
will sit in the rear.
He will manage. Let's go.
- Hurry up. Come on.
Get in. Get in.
- Sit comfortably.
Sit. Come on.
Come. Come, lad. Very good.
May God bless you
with prosperity, lad.
Not prosperity.
Just a beautiful girl. Yes.
Get that bag too.
Okay. Come on.
Come on. Let's go.
Murli, what happened?
I don't know. The vehicle is not
starting. I need the tool box.
Is that so? I will give you.
I know where the tool box is.
Wait.
Take this.
The goat has also come along?
What happened?
- What's going on?
Repair the vehicle. Repair
the vehicle. Repair the vehicle.
Why did you bring him?
Why did you bring him?
Say something.
What have you done?
Oh, God!
Zulfi, are you crazy?
- Don't scold Zulfi.
You have put us
in serious trouble.
People think he is God.
We had to flee at night
because of this wretch.
Don't scold Shahrukh.
- Beware!
If he had not been there,
we wouldn't have been slandered.
He didn't do anything.
We did it.
What?
- What did you do?
Zulfi is right.
We made this symbol on Shahrukh.
I made it.
- What?
You made this symbol?
Yes. I wrote 'Lord' on him.
Oh God!
What else could I do?
You wanted to sell Shahrukh.
Zulfi didn't want him
to go anywhere.
Zulfi wanted Shahrukh.
All of you wanted money.
Why didn't both of you tell us
for so many days?
What will happen now?
Nothing will happen.
Everyone knows the truth.
Let's return to the village.
Shut up!
- What? You are a fool!
What do we do now?
- What else?
We will do what we were doing.
Let's flee.
Murli, did you fix the vehicle?
Yes, sir. The vehicle has been fixed.
Come on. Sit in the vehicle.
Let's go. Hurry up.
Zulfi, come on.
Come on. Sit in the vehicle.
Ma'am.
- Come on. - Sir.
Get him in.
- Yes, priest. You sit as well.
Let's go.
- Hurry up.

I am opening it, sir.

Sir, it is a goat.

Who is behind this? No.
Sir, are they going

We can't take a chance.

The minister is expected
to stay there for two hours.
Meanwhile, let them remain here.
They will stay here until

Arrest everyone

We will verify later who is
innocent and who is guilty.
Provide them with all the treatment.

Look, how he is reclining. If
you could give him some drug..
I mean, medicine.
That's the medicine we offer.
Look. Take a good look.
This man is a smart chap.
He has gone to sleep.
Listen, find yourself a corner.
Come on.
Something is fishy.
I have an experience
of 30 years.
I can sense it.
No, sir.
- Sir
we had a doubt when
we opened the door.
We thought we would
find RDX, bombs.
Instead, we found a goat.
All are fools.
If they are fools,
we will let them go
once the minister leaves.
We have got orders
from our superiors.
Can't afford to take risk.
That's it.
Sir, we need to frisk the goat.
Frisk the goat?
- Of course.
Oh my!
Must weigh 15 kgs.
What is the market rate?
I don't know.
I asked my wife to make
'biryani' once.
She said, she would
break my bones.
We can't afford eggs
with our salary.
Mutton is beyond our reach.
Here is your chance.
Biryani. Kebab. Curry.
First, frisk the goat.
You don't know,
they fit it anywhere.
You are right.
Shinde, shove the stick inside.
See if it explodes.
Hold him.
- It is running.
Yes. - Wait. Come here.
- Stop.
What is this?
Oh my! Seems to be
some secret code. - Yes.
What is going on?
- See this.
Can you crack this code?
Code?
Oh God!
You all will be cursed.
Whom have you tied?
Why? Any problem?
Have all of you gone blind?
You have tied the Lord.
The Lord?
- What nonsense!
Not nonsense. A manifestation
of the Lord himself.
Look. Look carefully.
Yes. There is something.
- Yes.
Really.
- Oh God!
And you wanted to eat biryani?
O' Lord, I made a mistake.
I didn't know God
would come here like this.
How did you not see
such a big trident?
Oh God! All will be cursed.
God, forgive us this time.
We won't do this again.
Glory to the Lord!

Praise the Lord!
Keep this Hindu-Muslim unity

Glory to the Lord!

Glory to the Lord!

Why reverse circumambulation?
We do reverse circumambulation

This is how we will

'Sanju' (Emraan Hashmi) is an expert- master safe cracker who maintains a casual lifestyle with his wife Neetu (Vidya Balan).

He meets two criminals, Pandit and Idris and they offer him a chance to assist a bank robbery. If the heist is successful, they will ensure that he never has to worry about money again, so he accepts the offer.

The three thieves make off with 30 crore inr.

After the bank robbery, Pandit decides that Sanju should keep the suitcase of money hidden (as Pandit and Idris already have record with the police, coupled with the fact that Sanju is married, and will be the least suspected by the police ) and that they will meet after three months and then they will split the money.

After three months, Pandit and Idris discover that Sanjay lost his memory in an accident with head injury and hence, Sanju is suffering from retrograde amnesia.

Pandit and Idris decide that they can not trust Sanju anymore, they need to keep a close eye on him in case he runs away. They stay at Sanjay and Neetu's house until Sanjay remembers where he hid the money and to make sure they're not cheated. They give him a week to do so.

Sanjay tries to remember where he hid the money but he can not.

When Sanjay learns that his college friend Uttam Nagpal (Parvin Dabas) has become an overnight millionaire, apparently by winning a lottery, he suspects Uttam.

Then, he suspects his wife Neetu of knowing the hiding place of the money because she has a joint account with him and also sole-access to their bank-locker. He accuses her of conspiring with his friend.

Later, Sanju finds out that Uttam has moved to London after being confronted about the money and he also finds out that Neetu has purchased a one-way ticket for London. So, he goes to buy a gun to kill his wife Neetu in anger.

While he is doing this, an unknown person contacts Sanjay and urges him to divulge the location of the money.

Under pressure and now frustrated, Pandit and Idris kidnap Neetu and ask Sanjay to meet them in a train station by writing a note and attaching it to the screen of his TV, on the third platform at 1:30am.

When both Pandit and Idris confront Sanjay and demand the money, Sanjay claims that he doesn't even recognize the two.

When Sanjay tells them that Neetu knew where the money was, Idris begins to lose control. When he pulls the trigger on his pistol, he is shot dead by the unknown person and thereafter, he kills Pandit in a rage in the train.

The unknown person tells Sanjay that the bank robbery plan idea was his which he shared with Idris and Pandit but never got his share ...and after persistently questioning and trying to blackmail Sanjay, the unknown person shoots frantically in frustration and Neetu is injured—hoping that the traumatic vision of his wife's suffering will make Sanjay reveal the truth.

However, this fails since Sanjay has in fact lost all his memory by now, stressed by trauma.

The original mastermind of the bank heist searches Sanjay's pockets, only to find a banana. In retaliation, he shoots Sanjay in the shoulder and then Sanjay's phone rings.

It is revealed that the caller is Sanju's mother who calls her son like every other day out of her motherly affection and concern. However,during the conversation, she subconsciously reveals that the suitcase has been kept at her home while remaining implicitly oblivious as to what is in the suitcase and further questions Sanju whether he will be coming to take the suitcase or not. She further expresses her desire to sell the brief case off if in case Sanju does not turn up to take away his belonging. Meanwhile, the heist's mastermind overhears this and jumps on the train out of excitement but he slips on Sanjay's banana skin and impales his neck on Sanjay's fork. Disillusioned, confused and tired, Sanjay throws his phone out of the train while Neetu smiles. Sanjay has no idea what's going on, but the train goes on its way with the dead bodies of the mastermind, Pandit and Idris.",4004,NA,NA,NA

The movie starts with Tasha confronting Aryan about their intimate photo, which had been sent to her phone anonymously. Aryan's girlfriend Rishma appears with a gun to kill him. In a tussle, Rishma is shot and dies.

The story moves back, introducing Aryan and Rajveer, the sons of London based billionaire and politician Vikram Khurana. Looking for a fresh face to represent their company, Rajveer goes to a bar, where he is smitten by Tasha. He woos Tasha by promising her to make her a star and hires her for their company. In an attempt to lure her into bed, he pays some goons to attack her so he can swoop in as the hero. As he is paying the goons, someone takes a picture of the transaction. Aryan too is captivated by Tasha's beauty and is able to get her drunk at a party. That night, he sleeps with her, and she wakes up regretting the event. This is when their photo is sent to her phone.

In the present, Aryan convinces Tasha to quietly dispose of Rishma's body. They dump the body in a river. Tasha then reveals to the audience that she herself is the person behind all of this – the mastermind behind all the events thus far. She had known that Rajveer had hired goons and had bribed them as well; she also spiked Aryan's drink at the party, and after he passed out, she took photos with him in compromising positions to make it look like they slept together. She then sent the photos to Rishma.

Tasha continues to avoid Rajveer, making him desperate for her. Playing the brothers against each other, she publicly rejects Rajveer's proposal, telling him that Aryan told her about how Rajveer lures girls into bed and then leaves them. She also reveals that she and Aryan are involved. Aryan receives a video clip of him dumping Rishma's body.

Vikram is baffled by Rajveer's behaviour when he receives the compromising picture of Aryan and Tasha and the video of Aryan dumping a dead body. He gets a threatening call in which the blackmailer (Tasha) demands that his sons confess to the crime they committed two years ago in India. It is revealed that two years ago, Rajveer tried to force a girl named Bhavna into his car. When a passerby named Ashwin came to help her, Aryan shot him. Overcome by rage, Rajveer shot him multiple times, killing him. In the hospital, Ashwin is declared dead as his sister Natasha (Tasha) and his mother arrive. Bhavna's family is threatened by Vikram to keep silent, with Natasha vowing to avenge her brother's murder.

Presently, Rajveer, heartbroken, is unable to overcome the pain when he is informed that Aryan is the one who kidnapped his love. He confronts Aryan and threatens to reveal that Aryan killed Rishma. In the struggle to stop him, Aryan ends up killing Rajveer, then dumps him in a grave as suggested by Tasha. Rajveer's ex Monica discovers the truth about Tasha and tells Aryan. Aryan tries to kill Tasha but she successfully knocks him out and injures herself, acting innocent in front of the police, who then arrest Aryan.

In the ending credits, Tasha blames Vikram for being a bad father. At Natasha's home, Rishma, revealed to be alive, stands in front of Ashwin's picture; she had been his fiancé when he was alive.",3195,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt5325684.srt","'We are capable of both,

You don't need to go anywhere!
Tasha, stop it!
What's the use of stopping me now?
You should have stopped me that day.

So do you.
Me? How?
Like every other human being..
..65 percent of my body

Oh.

Yes. But not 65 percent..
100 percent.

face at such a short notice.
You don't seem to be satisfied.
What else do you want from me?
You know what I want, Rajveer.
I want to be the face of Senorita.
Don't worry, senorita.
You shouldn't worry about such
minuscule things in big countries.
You will be the face of this campaign.
Bye.
A new face?
But why do we need a new face?
Because this is what
the client demands.
And we have committed
to fulfill their demands.
But bro, I too have
made a commitment to Monica.

face of this campaign.

We are here to show you the way.
- She is damn hot.
- I know, I know, I know.
I did come to the
club to watch you dance.
But I neither have the desire
to make you dance to my tunes..
..nor do I have desire
to dance on anyone's.
Anyways, good night.
I am sorry.
Instead of thanking
you for helping me..
I got suspicious of you.
You know there is
no cure for suspicion.
Or there is.
What?
Hot, streaming, strong coffee.
If you are work two shifts
then when do you sleep?
Wait a second.
I hope you aren't a vampire.
Don't worry I won't suck your blood.
I prefer coffee.
Anyway, staying alone I have
learnt to make stellar coffee as well.
You stay alone?
Yes, I am alone but not lonely.
And as far as sleep is concerned..
I do sleep, and I dream too.
And sleep anyway tends to elude you..
..when your dreams remain unfulfilled.
Well, if you don't mind, can I know..
..which dreams make you sleepless?
Dreams of touching the
sky and shinning like a big star.
I want to be a star.
But..
But?
Before helping you in touching
the sky, people wanted to touch you.
So, I preferred to stay on the ground.
Well, in that case, you are in luck.
Why?
I don't have dreams of my own.
But I do fulfill dreams others have.
I didn't get you.
If you give me an
opportunity to explain..
..that I guarantee you
that you'll touch the sky.
Smile..
Okay, side ways..
I've provided you with the sky.
Now it's your turn to shine.
Aren't you tired of
stars pretending that..
..they like a particular cola drink
or need a certain fairness cream?
I don't think normal public believes..
..that stars really use
the products they endorse.
Normal public will
believe in a new face..
That is beautiful as well as fresh.
And with her endorsement,
they will surely buy our product.
Yeah, we totally agree.
But have you found such a fresh face?
I am sure we will.
We have it.
Well, people usually
apologize when they are late.
But I am not sorry that I am late.
Because the reason I am late..
Or rather,
the beautiful reason I am late..
Lies in this envelope.
And if we don't sign
this reason at the earliest..
..then according to me,
it will be too late.
She is a star.
And we should sign her at the earliest,
before anyone else spots her.
Are you sure?
I am so sure that I will guarantee it.
What if it doesn't work out?
If it doesn't work
then the loss is mine.
But if I am proven right,
you will have to pay me double.
Done.
We don't have any risk in this.
And if the product works,
we stand to gain.
- Then gentlemen, we have a deal.
- Okay.
Great.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Well done.
- Aryan..
You should keep business
and pleasure separated.
You have taken a risk worth millions
in business for Rajveer's pleasure.
People shed blood for blood ties.
This is just money, Rishma.
You are the best, bro.
And come on,
Rishma.. don't be so grumpy.
Come on.
You need a hug.
- Stop it Rajveer.
- Okay, I'll take you out for dinner.
- No.
- Dinner is on me.
What will you have?
India, Japanese, Thai.
- Come on Rishma smile now, please.
- Okay.
That's like you.
What do we do now, Aryan?
We cannot call the police either.
No one will believe
that this was an accident.
I am so scared, Aryan.
I feel as if Rishma's
dead eyes glaring at me.
They are accusing me.
Don't be crazy, okay?
She is dead.
We are alive.
We have to survive this.
We will have to dispose her body.
We have to get rid of it.
No one should find her dead body.
Do you understand?
If I knew that..
The price to live my dreams
was someone else's death..
Then I would never have such dreams.
Never.
Hats off to you.
You've handled this really well.
This girl is magic.
For the first time in my life,
I'm happy to pay double.
Trust me you still got a good deal,
my friend.
Time will tell her true value.
Only time will tell her true value,
my friend.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
I can't believe it, Rajveer.
It all feels like a dream.
Fulfilled dreams always
feel like a dream.
I just made you a promise.
And your talent and beauty
helped fulfill that promise.
I too make you a promise.
One day I shall repay
you for all you have done.
You have changed my life.
Ladies and gentlemen..
Can I have your attention please?
It's always said that behind
every successful man there is a woman.
But I am really-really lucky because
behind my success..
..there is not only one, but two women.
Rishma, thank you so much darling.
- Pleasure.
- Without you..
..this ad launch would
have not been possible.
Your welcome.
And now there is no heart
that is not ruled by Tasha.
So Tasha, welcome to the family.
Thank you.
Oh yes, and speaking of family..
I want to share another
big news with you.
And that big news is that my father,
Mr. Vikram Khurana..
..one of the most affluent
tycoons in the city..
..has been nominated
for the mayoral election.
So please,
join me in raising your glass to him..
And his victory.
How are you son?
- Wonderful to see you.
- Hi, dad.
Hi!
How are you son?
If you don't mind..
Won't you introduce
me to that beautiful girl?
Of course, dad.
Please come.
Dad, this is Tasha.
And Tasha, this is my dad.
Mr. Vikram Khurana.
See how unfortunate I am.
After such a long time, I am being
introduced to such a beautiful girl.
And that too, as dad.
Thanks for the flattery.
Today, after meeting
you for the first time..
..I have realized that
your sons have taken after you.
As the saying goes..
The apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.
You are smart.
- I like it.
- Thank you.
Tasha, media is waiting.
Oh yes, you should go.
- Please carry on. Yes.
- Excuse me dad.
- Thank you.
- Fine Mathew
Apple reminds me..
Adam was thrown out of
heaven because of an apple.
I don't want your brother to suffer..
..the same consequences
because of this girl.
Be careful.
As a kid,
playing with toys is acceptable.
But if an adult obsesses over a toy,
he behaves childishly.
Keep an eye on him till
the mayoral elections aren't over.
You understand?
Got it, dad.
I'll make sure that you don't
face any problems because of Rajveer.
Hey Steve..
Let's discuss, come.
What are you doing?
Bro, you.. I want her.
I am crazy about her.
Be crazy, but don't do crazy things.
Win over her heart..
And her body will
automatically be yours.
Just look at Rishma and me.
Boardroom or bedroom..
There's not one thing
she won't do to satisfy me.
Make Tasha your Rishma.
It will not just benefit you,
but the company as well.
I hate it when you are right, bro.
Ok, who wants another drink?
Today I feel as if I have taken
the first step towards my destination.
I am so happy I found you.
You didn't find me, I found you.
And now that I have found you,
I won't let you go.
But you will have to let me go today.
My bed is calling me.
Really?
What a coincidence.
I think your bed is calling me too.
Sweet dreams.
You give me sleepless nights
and wish me sweet dreams as well?
Not fair.
Try to sleep.
Who knows,
we might meet again, in your dreams.
Alright. Good night.
Take care.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Well.. well..
well, what do we have here.
You look gorgeous tonight.
- Maybe you got tired.
- Leave me.
Oh my god! Go away.
Wassup.. Wassup..
Relax.. Relax..
Let me finish.
- Oh baby just come with us.
- Please.
We just wana talk to you.
- Come with us.
- Leave me.
Let her go.
Hey who is this guy?
Are you okay?
You shouldn't have.
Thank God,
you forgot your purse in my car.
Otherwise, I am scared just thinking
about what could have happened.
If you keep coming to my
rescue then I'll get used to it.
If you stay in such an area, then I'll
have to keep coming to rescue you.
If not here, then where will I stay?
Rajveer, I cannot afford this place.
Please try to understand.
You should just accept presents..
..without worrying
about the affordability.
Are you crazy?
I cannot accept such
an expensive present.
Fair enough.
Don't worry then.
One day,
I'll surely take a gift in turn.
Really?
So, you are giving with
an intention to take something.
No.
I am giving it with an
intention to attain something.
Anyway, when something
is so priceless..
..it has to be kept
both safe and close.
Tasha, I..
What, Rajveer?
I..
Yes, I was saying that it's late.
I should..
I should leave.
I'll see you.
Tomorrow?
No.
Tonight.
In my dreams.
Goodbye.
Rajveer..
Thank you.
Here he is.
Wassup' brother.
Thank you so much for your help.
Anything you need bro.
Let us know.
- We are leaving.
- Thank you.
Someone has rightly said:
Easy come, easy go.
I was easy..
That's why I lost you.
I think you've lost the plot, Monica.
Such kind of a behavior
doesn't suit you.
No, baby.
I am the twist in the plot.
And I'll make sure.. you lose.
You were right.
About Rajvir and Tasha.
Keep an eye on them.
Sure.
It's your money.
Hi!
What are you doing here?
I mean, how did you come in?
You should always keep
your house and your heart locked.
Otherwise,
thieves can sneak in easily.
There is nothing worth
stealing in the house.
And the heart is needed
for only two things.
To stay alive.
And to be stolen by the
one you wish to live with.
But there is a difference
between lovers and thieves.
Thieves don't return the stolen goods.
And lovers leave their heart behind
in exchange of the stolen heart.
Anyway, this is for you.
What is it?
One year's contract for
you and an advance cheque.
Thank you so much.
And this too is for you.
And that's a key to what?
To your new car.
It's parked outside.
Ah, now don't be a party-pooper and say:
I cannot accept it, blah blah blah.
Just take it and enjoy yourself.
Have fun.
I was going to say no such thing.
Because I know, both you
and your brother are the same.
And I will have to behave
the same with both of you.
Ah, excuse me.
Sure.
Yes Rishma, tell me.
Rishma..
You are neither answering
my calls not replying to my messages.
Tell me what the problem is.
Aryan, the problem
is that I know the truth.
And truth hurts.
Truth?
Truth about what?
Why are you being melodramatic?
I am being melodramatic..
Because you have
stopped being romantic.
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
forgotten the first anniversary..
..of the proposal you made to me
at this very place, on this very day.
Rishma..
""We were together, one day..""
""Lost in each other.""
""What you had whispered
into my ears that day..""
""Don't say it to anyone else.""
""You are mine, always stay mine.""
""You are mine, always stay mine.""
""Always be there for me.""
""You are mine, always stay mine.""
""There is one place in this world..""
""Which I find safe.""
""There is one place in this world..""
""Which I find safe.""
""Your arms..""
""That's how big my world is.""
""Keep me in your arms.""
""You are mine, always stay mine.""
""You are mine, always stay mine.""
""Always be there for me.""
""You are mine, always stay mine.""
""If not for you this heartache
would be unbearable.""
""If I wasn't crazy about you,
in love with you..""
""I would have been long dead.""
""You have more right over
me than I have on any given day.""
""Make me a promise today.
""Goodbye..""
""Never say goodbye..""
""You are mine, always stay mine.""
""You are mine, always stay mine.""
""Always be there for me.""
""You are mine, always stay mine.""
I'll tell everyone that she's gone
on a retreat, like she often does.
Get in the car.
No, I am not going to.
Tasha, we cannot change what happened.
But what happens
now is in our control.
Let's just finish this.
No.
Oh come on..
Come. Just get in the car.
Get in the car.
'There's an old saying:'
'If you want to make God laugh,
then tell Him your plans.'
'But even before we could tell Him,
God was laughing perhaps..'
'..when we had just
thought about them.'
British Tourism's campaign
today should be perfect, okay?
- Rishma! - Our agency will also
get promotion along with them.
Rishma!
Yeah.
I'll call you back, okay?
Rishma!
Rajveer? What are you doing here?
Hi.
I need to discuss something
important with you.
And the topic of this
important discussion is Tasha?
How do you know?
Now if you keep following her 24/7,
like the mobile network's doggie..
Won't it become obvious?
So, you know.
Then you tell me, what should I do?
Look Rajveer, Tasha has an X factor..
..but she isn't like your Exs, okay?
She's a simple Indian girl.
And she needs a commitment.
But I don't think so you
are ready for a commitment.
Wait..
What makes you say that?
I am ready to make any
kind of a commitment. I love her.
Then tell her.
You mean..?
I propose that you go and propose.
See, today we are doing the campaign
shoot for the British Tourism.
And she's the face of the campaign.
I think today's a perfect
day for double celebration.
Do you think she'll say yes?
When the right guy proposes,
no girl rejects it.
Like I couldn't say no to Aryan.
He has eyes only for me.
It's not going come in to play,
there is no way.
What is your advice
to aspiring models?
If you think you are beautiful,
so will the world.
Britain once ruled India..
Today, you are now the
face of British Tourism.
As an Indian,
what have you got to say about this?
You just ruled our land.
As an Indian,
I am here to rule your hearts.
And you have started
that with my heart.
Last question.
What's your biggest dream in life?
I'm already living my biggest dream.
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you.
I too have a dream.
Will you fulfill it?
The dream you had
with your eyes open or..
..closed?
Both are the same.
When I open my eyes, I should see you.
And before I close my eyes,
I should see you.
I have a great news.
Rajveer is going to propose to Tasha.
What?
I have been in love with
you since the time I first saw you.
And from the time, I've been
in love with you, I see only you.
I love you, Tasha.
I love you too.
Rishma, I forgot to tell you.
You and Rajveer will have
to leave for Leeds tonight itself.
For Roy's meeting.
But wasn't that meeting
scheduled for next week?
It was, but he called
and rescheduled it.
I forgot to inform you.
Oh.
I would have gone..
..but I have to entertain
the officials along with Tasha..
At tonight's party.
Okay.
Work comes first.
Oh, I love you baby.
- Okay, come.
- Yes, come.
Mr. Roy, can we reschedule the next
week's meeting and have it tonight?
I won't be able to make it
but Rajveer and Rishma will be there.
Thank you.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
I am so happy for both of you guys.
Thank you so much.
I am sorry, Tasha.
Here I have you alone on
the very day I proposed to you.
It's okay. I can understand.
I'll see you.
Come on.
'I thought we will finally
get together tonight.'
'Never mind..'
'I'll wait another day for your love.'
- Hello Mr. Aryan.
- Hello Tasha.
- You looking beautiful.
- Thank you so much..
- Ah, pleasure to see you again.
- Hello Mr. Aryan.
- Hello sir.
- Hello Mr. Aryan.
- Tasha you looking stunning.
- Thanks.
Come.. come..
- Ah, Simond.
- Mr. Aryan.
Congratulations on
bagging this campaign.
And it is our pleasure..
..that such a beautiful lady will
be representing our British Heritage.
Thank you.
It's my pleasure, sir.
I must say, Aryan, the gorgeous
lady that is by your side..
..everyone else in the room
is burning up and dying of jealousy.
Now that is the hallmark
of a beautiful woman.
She always has men
ready to die for her.
Stop it.
You are making me blush.
Okay, I will stop.
You can make me do whatever you want.
Cheers.
Thank you.

Tasha!
What have you done, Aryan?
Tasha, I wasn't in my senses.
I was sloshed.
You used me!
I did no such thing!
I swear, it was an accident.
What has happened will
break your brother's heart.
Rajveer and I, we love each other.
He proposed to me yesterday.
I am really sorry.
How will I look into his eyes?
How will I tell him that
I spent a night with his brother?
You don't need to tell him anything.
You want me to lie
and break his trust?
No, I want you to not to
break his heart by hiding the truth.
No one knows anything
other than the two of us.
It will be our little secret.
It's never a secret..
..when more than one person knows it.
Tasha..
I will not do anything
that would hurt you.
I have been in love with
you since the moment I saw you.
What are you saying, Aryan?
It is the truth.
I'm crazy about you.
But you are with Rishma.
Yes, I am with Rishma.
But since quite some time now,
in spite of being with each other..
..we are drifting apart.
It hurts a lot when
a relationship breaks.
But it hurts even
more when it shatters.
And right then..
You entered my life
to relieve me from the pain.
Now look, I am really-really
sorry for what happened.
I will set everything right.
You just handle your guilt, okay?
I'll protect your dignity.
I swear, trust me.
Good morning..
Hello, hello.
- Good morning..
- Good morning..
Well, I spent the last night
without you because of the assurance..
..that I will be spending
the rest of my life with you.
This morning is
questioning you and not me:
""Madam, where did
you spend the night?""
What happened? Everything's okay?
Well..
Rajveer, last night..
What happened, Tasha?
- Actually..
- You are scaring me.
Last night at the party..
What happened at the party?
Nothing.
I am not feeling well.
I have a headache.
I got so excited about
your proposal that..
I had a little too many
drinks at the party last night.
I have a hangover. It's nothing.
I need to rest.
- Hi, darling.
- Hi.
- How was yesterday's meeting?
- Great.
- All set for today?
- Yes, all set.
So how was last night's party?
You know, same old, same old..
Nothing special.
Actually, I wanted to show
you the presentation pictures.
I am sure they are good.
Still. Have a look.
What is this?
How did you get these pictures?
Someone messaged me.
Look Rishma, it's not as it seems.
Okay!
You mean, this is not you?
And this isn't Tasha either?
We never got such
interesting pictures clicked.
But I am sure I can recognize you.
Look Rishma,
I had a little too much to drink.
- I..
- You know what, Aryan..
You are an a**hole.
You purposely send Rajveer
and me for the meeting last night.
So that you can have
a good time with Tasha.
That girl played a very good game.
First, she trapped
the younger brother.
Then the elder brother.
Hats off to her.
- Bloody b*t*h
- That's enough!
You can abuse me all you want,
but don't say a word against Tasha.
Damn!
To hell with you and
your company Aryan Khurana!
Yes, Tasha?
Aryan, where are you?
Come here right now.
What happened?
Don't waste time, damn it!
Get here now.
I am coming.
You have destroyed my life, Aryan.
Just give me some time.
I will set everything right.
So, I was right.
Leave the gun, Rishma!
What have you done, Aryan!
Tasha, we cannot change what happened.
But what happens
now is in our control.
Tasha..
Tasha..
Tasha..
Tasha, take care of yourself.
Don't do this, Aryan.
We can't do this to her.
Tasha, she is dead.
We are alive.
Think about that.
Just a few more steps.
After that,
we will get rid of this problem.
- Alright?
- Okay.
I have put so much weight on it
that her dead body will never surface.
Tasha..
Tasha, she is gone.
It's just the two of us now, okay?
Let's leave before anyone shows up.
Let's go.
Yes, it's just the two of us.
Aryan, what do you think..
This is a love story?
This isn't a love story..
It's a hate story.
The game has just begun.
There's a saying in my mother tongue
Shrouds come without pockets,
so the dead don't take bribes.
The dead don't take bribes..
- But you're alive..
- That we are.
Rajveer will bribe you to harass me.
And I will bribe
you to take his bribe.
Suits me. I get double.
You get double and he gets trouble!
Keep giving updates to
Monica about Rajveer and me.
Her love for Rajveer
will be my strength.
Okay.
She is damn hot.
I know.. I know..
Come in..
These photographs should change
the fate of the Khurana family.
After I am done dealing
with the Khuranas..
..not just they, but the whole world
shall always remember their fate.
Why aren't you shooting, Tasha?
Wherever I look,
I see Rishma's dead body.
Her dead eyes accuse me.
How can you remain normal after killing
someone and disposing off the body?
Stop this nonsense!
What do I do, Aryan?
I am scared!
Tasha, even I am scared.
But I am scared of your fear.
Look, everyone thinks she
has gone to a retreat for a week.
No one will have any doubts.
No one will mention her or
worry about her at least for a week.
And what happens after a week?
After a week..
After a week, I will file
a missing person's complaint.
No one will find her dead body.
The case will die and become cold.
And that blackmailer..
Who had sent us those photos?
A person's intention
displays his weakness.
As soon as he makes a demand, I will
know his intention and his weakness.
Then I'll find him
and I will deal with him.
Everything will be fine.
But don't do anything
to catch everyone's attention.
Okay?
What's happening here?
Nothing, Rajveer.
Tasha wasn't in a mood to shoot.
So, I was explaining to her..
That the client has
given us a deadline.
But doesn't Rishma do all that?
Why are you doing it?
Where's Rishma?
She..
It's funny that Rishma
is still not here.
As far as I know Rishma,
she lives and dies for her work.
Wait a second, let me just call her.
Rajveer, you know her..
When she wants a break,
not even work can stop her.
I got her message. She has
gone to the retreat for a few days.
She will be back.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.
Tasha..
Tasha, enough is enough.
You avoided interacting
with me during the shoot.
You didn't even look into my eyes.
In the green room,
you were crying in Aryan's arms.
Ever since then I have
been asking you what is wrong..
..but you are not giving me a reply!
Just tell me what is wrong!
Just tell me!
Okay!
I will tell you!
Or better I will show you!
Look carefully, if you cannot
recognize her face then look carefully..
..I am sure you will
remember her body.
Suzanne, your ex-girlfriend.
She lasted for four weeks.
Anita, three months.
Rochelle, four months.
And Monica, she lasted the longest.
Six months.
And these are the black guys
whom you had bribed to harass me..
So that you could trap me.
You are not trying
to understand, Tasha..
Whoever has sent you these
photographs wants to separate us.
They want to break us up.
Only the things which
are intact can be broken.
Thank God, I know all these things
about you before we got together.
You think I cannot
give you a commitment?
Fine, now I'll show you how one gives
his heart and commitment to someone.
This relationship will only last
as long as your short life, Rajveer.
I will kill you if you
try to separate Tasha and me.
This is the first
time a UK based Indian..
..is on the verge
of becoming the mayor.
All polls show that his
win is now a foregone conclusion!
How do you feel, sir?
Overwhelmed.
Humbled.
As the exit polls indicate
my victory is certain..
..all I can say is,
I am very touched..
..by the love given
to me by people of England.
And for people back home:
When I came to England
a long time ago..
..I had never thought I'd get
such love, respect and status here.
And to people of England,
all I can say is:
Your magnanimity..
Your graciousness..
- Hello Aryan.
- How are you?
Good to see you.
Tasha..
I cannot find Rajveer.
After what happened yesterday,
I am not surprised.
Why?
What happened between
the two of you yesterday?
Only a discussion that nothing
can happen between us now.
Why did you need to tell him that?
So, what should I have told him?
Come, let's be together.
So what if I have slept
with your elder brother?
Draupadi was a common
consort of the five Pandavas.
There are just two brothers here.
You..
Oh God, who is calling me?
- Damn.
- What happened?
Come with me.
What happened, Aryan?
What's wrong with you?
Look at this!
Oh my god.
What will we do now?
We are surely going to be arrested!
If someone wanted us to get arrested..
..we would have been
behind bars by now.
The blackmailer who sent
this clip is the same blackmailer..
..who had sent those photographs.
He doesn't want to get us arrested.
He wants something else.
We have to be very very careful.
And come what may,
nothing should hamper dad's campaign.
Aryan, we had forgotten
that there is no perfect crime!
Ladies and gentleman.
Good evening, everyone.
- Good evening hello, hi, how are you.
- This is Rajveer.
Attention please.
Hello.
Hi!
My name is Rajveer Khurana.
Before I say anything dad..
I just want to thank you.
And I just want tell you..
..how lucky I am to be your son.
And how proud I am.
And I know dad,
that I have not been a good son.
I am sorry.
But I wanna confess..
In front of you,
in front of this whole world..
- No, bro..I won't stop.
- Rajveer.
So please don't try to stop me either.
Sorry.. I am sorry,
ladies and gentlemen..
As I was saying, if a girl
has more than one relationship..
..then she is labeled
as a characterless woman.
And if a boy has relationship
with more than one girl..
..then he is praised.
They call him a player, dad.
But I don't get it.
I don't get this.
A boy who plays with someone's heart,
her body, her emotions..
How can he be a player?
He is an animal, isn't it..?
Just like me.
But I am a changed man, dad.
And..
And the girl who has changed me..
Who made me realize that
the union of two bodies is not..
..as important as
the union of two hearts.
And dad, that girl is Tasha.
I love you, Tasha.
I love you.

Tasha!
You shouldn't have created
a scene there, Rajveer.
You have jeopardized
your dad's campaign.
To hell with his campaign, Tasha.
You matter to me.
We matter, Tasha.
Rajveer, why don't you understand..
We can never be together.
Why can't we be together?
Because at a time, there
can be just one man in my life..
And not two!
What do you mean?
There is someone else
in my life, Rajveer.
And here I thought
that you were decent.
But I was so wrong.
You're such a sl*t.
Who's that son of b*t*h
who came between us!
What is his name!
You really wanna know who he is?
Then I'll tell you.
- That son of b*t*h..
- Rajveer!
What the hell are you doing?
I have tasted blood, bro.
Now I am a scoundrel
as well as a monster.
Come what may, Tasha will be mine.
Anyone who comes between
us will die such a horrific death..
..by my hands that even his own family
won't be able to recognize his dead body!
You are not in your senses.
Just go home. Now!
Congratulations.
Today you did what
no one could ever do.
You took my heart from me..
And then you broke it.
What the hell were
you going to tell him?
I was about to tell him about us.
I can't be with him, Aryan.
If there is anyone I can
spend my life with then it's you.
Only you.
- What?
- Yes, Aryan.
I have started to realize
that I only keep thinking about you.
We should tell Rajveer the truth..
That we are together.
Tasha, we don't have
time for all this.
Blackmailer has a video
clip of Rishma's murder. He..
I love you, Aryan..
I love you so much.
I can't live without you..
'There are many who backstab
others while pretending to be close.'
'But I'll slab your
back in such a way..'
'..that it'd come
out piercing your heart.'
Rajveer!
Where the hell is Rajveer!
Dad, what happened?
What is wrong?
Where is Rajveer?
And you..
Don't you get it?
You don't understand!
You don't get it!
I asked you to keep
him away from that girl..
..till the mayoral
elections don't end!
You cannot handle a girl!
Just calm down, dad.
I'll handle everything.
Calm down?
What did you say?
Calm down!
I am sorry, son.
I was mistaken.
You have handled that girl so well.
I had asked you to make sure
your brother keeps his pants up.
But that didn't mean I gave
you the permission to drop your pants.
Dad, it was a mistake.
It all happened in a drunken stupor.
You got drunk and I am
suffering from its hangover.
Interesting.
Very interesting.
My younger son wants
to marry a girl..
..that my eldest son
slept with before marriage.
Interesting.
Does Rishma know about this?
Yes.
And she let you live?
Because you killed
her before she could.
Dad..
Look, someone is
trying to blackmail us.
If these photographs
and video clip leak..
..then your death
won't be an accident.
You'll be hanged by law!
I will only lose the elections,
but you..
Who is this blackmailer?
What does he want?
I don't know, dad.
He has so far made no demands.
He hasn't made any demands?
But he keeps on sending messages.
Check what it is.
I cannot tolerate
these beeps any more.
Mr. Khurana,
I am sure by now you know that..
..I am not playing some childish game.
Tell both your sons to confess
the crime they committed..
..two years ago in
India on this very day.
Otherwise, I will handover these
pics and clips to the local police.
And soon as these get downloaded,
your sons will get uploaded.
Two years ago.
That means..
Ashwin Chaudhary.
So let's go to other club.
- I love this place.
- Guys, I am so tired!
- I want to go home.
- Listen, so what if one club is closed?
- Other clubs are still open.
- Yes.
- Someone please reason it with him.
- No, exactly, Bhavna.
You should come with us.
And what will I do
with the two of you?
Enjoy?
I'll enjoy tomorrow.
I'm very tired.
Bye.
I have to go, I have to go.
I am very tired.
- Bye bye bye..
- Okay bye.
- See you tomorrow.
- We'll miss you.
- Bye!
- Miss you too.
- Come.
- Let's go.
You are too hot to go home alone.
Shall I drop you home?
No, thank you.
Thank me after you
start having fun, baby.
Just get lost, okay?
Really.
Let go!
This is what people
have stopped being nice.
Because in the end its
being rogue that always works.
Let me go!
I still haven't even
held you properly.
I am somebody who can get anybody.
But I want nobody
other than your body.
Let go of me!
- Let go of me!
- Come.
No, leave me!
- Hey!
- What?
- What's happening?
- Please help me.
- Let go of her hand.
- I won't. What will you do?
Let go of her hand.
Don't worry about it, okay?
I'll handle this.
Hey, don't interfere, otherwise..
I wouldn't have interfered if I were
going to get scared of your otherwise..
Understand?
Don't worry.
She is your sister?
No!
But she must be someone's sister.
No, no, no!
No please!
Rajveer, get in the car!
Rajveer, I said get in the car.
You should have thought
twice before using the gun.
Guns don't require safety,
but your mind does.
How many times have I told
you to keep your brother in control!
Okay, were there any witnesses?
There was a girl.
Look dad,
we cannot change what happened.
Now please tell us what we should do.
Get out of India.
Come back to England immediately.
I will handle the rest.
Ashwin!
Thank God,
you regained consciousness, dear.
Your dad and I were so worried.
Okay.
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.
Mr. Shrivastava..
Yes, speaking.
Please pay attention
to what I am about to say.
Who are you?
Forget that.
Don't bother about it.
Your daughter Bhavna
who is in the hospital..
..don't try to find the reason.
The cop standing behind you..
..has already received
his bonus this month.
The rest is up to you.
So madam, you mean to say that
there were no street lights there..
..and hence there
was a lot of darkness.
And that's why you couldn't
take a good look at those two boys.
This is what you want to
say in your testimony, right?
I have given no such statement, right?
You are right, inspector.
Bhavna didn't see them.
- Papa, I saw..
- You didn't see anything.
- But..
- Please?
Try to understand.
Inspector,
it happened just as you said.
Good.
Madam!
Why are you wasting
your time as well as mine?
- How many times have I told you..
- That girl is lying.
That girl didn't even see
the faces of those two boys.
How can we file a
case against just anyone? Right?
You are right.
What can you do?
Now whatever needs to be done,
will be done by me.
Do it, do it on your own.
But let me tell you something.
I cannot get you justice
without that girl's testimony.
Go, okay.
Bhavna..
If you don't tell me
the truth then no brother..
..will never consider an unknown girl
as his sister and risk his life for her.
My brother has given you a new world.
A new life.
And you are supporting
those who killed my brother?
I too have a right to
know who killed my brother.
My daughter has already
spoken to the cops.
You should leave, please.
Bhavna, please? Bhavna?
Bhavna, please tell me.
- Bhavna, please?
- I said you should leave, please.
Bhavna..
Madam, there's a parcel for you.
'I was a coward hence
I lied to the cops.'
'They have bribed the
system and the police.'
'No one can do them any harm.'
'Except for a sister.'
'She is neither scared of the
system nor does she need the police.'
'The names of the boys
who brutally killed Ashwin are..'
'Aryan and Rajveer Khurana.'
Someone from Ashwin Chaudhary's
family is targeting us.
Find out who it is.
That person doesn't know
how powerful Khuranas are.
And listen..
Don't be an ideal brother and confess
everything to your younger brother.
If the devil in him rises then his
stupidity will ruin everything for us.
Does he know everything
about you and Tasha?
No. He doesn't know.
""Love has given me..""
""A never-ending ache.""
""The sky reflecting..""
""In my eyes, too, is wet.""
""I had never imagined..""
""Whatever that happened.""
""Love makes you crave.""
""What kind of a punishment is this?""
""Heartache too gives you
a strange kind of pleasure.""
""My complaints..""
""Are expressed in my eyes.""
""I object to your callousness.""
""My complaints..""
""Are expressed in my eyes.""
""I object to your callousness.""
""If you get upset..""
""If that happens..""
""My heartbeat disapproves..
My heart refutes.""
""Without you, for me..""
""Love is full of forlornness.""
""Love makes you crave.""
""What kind of a punishment is this?""
""Heartache too gives you
a strange kind of pleasure.""
- Hello?
- Hello.
Who is that?
Wouldn't you like to know who replaced
you in Tasha's heart and bed?
Who's that?
After your stint of being a hero..
..I had decided that I
wouldn't spare either of you.
And then I started keeping
an eye on both of you.
And imagine my joy when I hit jackpot!
Just tell me the name of the
person who stole my Tasha from me.
Let me take that first.
Two brothers,
one better than the other.
What a great family you have!
Just like the movie
'Hum Saath Saath Hai' type!
The family that eats together,
lives together, sleeps together!
You cheated me with my own brother!
Yes!
With the same brother who told me..
..he had fallen in love with
me the moment he saw my photograph!
With the same brother who showed me the
photographs of all your ex-girlfriends!
Who told me how you bribed those ruffians
to harass me so that you can have me!
I was just a toy for you.
You wanted to have a little fun,
play with me.
If Aryan hadn't stopped
you on the day of the launch..
..then you would have spiked my drink!
This is your true love?
That b**tard!
He instigated you against
me so that he can have me, Tasha!
Rajveer, I had really started
to fall in love with you.
But Aryan made me realize
that I had always loved you..
..but you were always
after only my body.
He told you all my attributes.
But perhaps he forgot to mention his.
Didn't he use Rishma?
He pretended to be in love
with her and manipulated her.
You know what?
Let Rishma get back from the retreat.
Rishma knows everything.
What?
You mean Rishma knows about you two?
Whatever you need to ask..
Go and ask Aryan.
I will surely ask Aryan..
But you should start talking
now or else I will kill you!
Rishma is dead..
Rishma is dead.
Aryan..
You will have to
pay.. for your betrayals.
When the younger one will
go to kill his elder brother..
.. it won't be an epic
of love but an epic of war!
So make sure we file the papers today.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Aryan, Rajveer knows everything.
The blackmailer has
given him all the evidences.
He's gone mad.
He kept repeating that he'd kill you.
I am so scared, Aryan!
He is coming to get you.
And the Oscar goes to..
Rajveer..
Rajveer, I..
This is the place..
This is the place where I
brought Tasha for the first time..
To fulfill her dreams.
And today..
Today, the same place holds
nothing but my broken dreams.
You know what hurts me
more than my shattered dreams?
The fact that someone
close shattered them!
My own brother.
Look Rajveer..
I can explain everything.
A girl shouldn't come between us.
Which girl are you talking about?
Oh, you mean, Rishma!
You killed her because she
came between you and Tasha, right?
No!
Whatever that happened with Rishma..
That was an accident!
Really?
Just like Ashwin's
death was an accident?
Right?
The bullets got fired
from the gun on their own.
Your hands begged to
the trigger to use it, right?
What nonsense!
You very well know that
I killed Ashwin so that you live.
I shed his blood so that
I could save my flesh and blood.
Ever since childhood, I have
given you whatever you asked for.
I have valued your
happiness more than mine!
So you are using this
excuse to settle the score?
Or are you tired of pretending
to be a great elder brother?
- Rajveer!
- Enough!
If you had asked,
I would have even given you my life!
But you didn't ask..
you just snatched it away!
Rajveer, you very well know
that I am ready to even die for you!
Are you ready to tell the truth?
Then let's do one thing.
Let's go to the cops and confess.
We will tell them that
we both killed Ashwin in Mumbai..
..and here,
in London, you killed Rishma.
Okay? Let's go!
Rajveer!
Have you lost your mind?
We will lose everything if we do that!
I have nothing left
to lose after I lost Tasha!
The truth is that you don't
want to confess and lose her!
Anger and stubbornness
has blinded you.
Not blind, I am ruined in love!
And now it's your turn to get ruined.
I am going to the cops.
Rajveer! You cannot!
Let me see who will stop me.
Rajveer!
Let go, Aryan!
Rajveer, don't force me.
She was my life!
She was my life!
No! No! No!
Rajveer..!
Rajveer..!
Rajveer..?
Get up, Rajveer!
Rajveer..!
Get up, Rajveer! Get up!
I killed him, Tasha..
I killed my own brother.
- It was an accident.
- No!
Rajveer!
Rajveer..
What should we do?
What should we do now?
Dad.. should we call dad?
Listen, no.
No one should find out
what happened here, okay?
'It's said that we
are just a clay puppet..'
'Made by God.'
'But your sister made him bite
dust and sent him to God, Ashwin.'
'One down..'
'One to go.'
I don't know when he left.
I was with the client..
Officer my son Rajveer has been
missing for the last two days.
You know he left right
after my nomination party.
We've.. tried everywhere,
his cell's off..
He has never done
anything like this before.
Mr. Khurana,
we'll make sure the information..
..gets to all relevant authorities.
Don't worry. We'll track him down.
Really appreciate it.
I am worried about Rajveer.
Don't worry, dad.
We will find him.
Hi, Ron.
How have you been?
Dude, that girl has become a star..
Which girl?
What do you mean which girl?
The one that was so desperate
to get my place at the club..
..that she paid for me
to go on a year long vacation?
- Alia?
- Yeah.
I have a deal for you.
Deal?
I don't know what
you are talking about.
Are you talking about
this girl, right?
Yeah! Tasha!
Show Ron as well.
The star maker seems
to have forgotten the girl..
..that he helped become a star.
This is a once in a lifetime offer!
For the next one year, you don't have
to show anyone your face or your body!
Thanks.
Looks like destiny is smiling on me.
Yes, it is.
And destiny's name is Tasha.
Bro, she is hot!
I know, I am very much sure that
she is gonna burn the dance floor.
Yes, she's out to burn the world!
We have the recent photograph..
- ..then I just forward to you.
- Yes, we got it. Don't worry.
We will circulate it
all around the authority..
Thank you, officer.
- Aryan?
- Listen, it's a bad time.
I don't have time if you've called
to cry about Rajveer's shenanigans.
Aryan, listen to me.
I tried calling Rajveer
but his cell is switched off.
That's why I am calling you.
I didn't call to talk about myself.
I called to tell you
something about Tasha.
Tasha?
What do you want
to tell me about Tasha?
What are you doing here?
Tasha, you have been
a great support to me.
And everything will soon be fine now.
So I want to gift you a story.
A story?
But you'll have to close your eyes,
to hear and feel it.
Once upon a time,
in a kingdom far far away..
There was a king who had two sons.
They were the princes of that kingdom.
The elder brother loved
his younger sibling.
He was ready to do anything
to fulfill all his whims and fancies.
He was the apple of his eyes.
One day,
both the brothers went to India.
And there they met a boy..
..whose parents had given
him tad too many good values.
And because of those good values..
..that poor guy lost
his life too early.
That boy's name was
Late Ashwin Chaudhary.
And you turned out to be his sister.
Soon to be Late Natasha Chaudhary,
a.k.a. Tasha!
You cheater.
If I don't send you
to your brother then..
I don't know whether I
should applaud you or pity you..
..for this incomplete story of yours.
Okay!
I will do one thing!
Let me tell you a story
to complete this incomplete story.
And listen, you don't need
to close your eyes to feel my story.
Keep your eyes open and hear it.
Because I am going to really
enjoy narrating this story.
So this is a story of a sister..
Who had made herself a promise..
..that she would take such a
revenge from her brother's murderers..
..that they would be scared
to come into this world again.
Brothers have fought an epic war
against each other earlier as well.
It is known to everyone
as Mahabharata.
And that war was also fought
because of a woman, Draupadi.
And this Draupadi is the
cause of this Mahabharata..
..in the lives of you two brothers.
I danced at the club
that day so that..
..I could make both of
you dance to my tunes in future.
Your biggest weakness
became my biggest strength.
The lure of my body and my
face made both of you lose your mind.
I played such a game..
..that both the rules
and the game belonged to me!
I am not done with the story.
If I wanted,
I could have killed Rajveer.
But the feeling I got by
making one brother kill another..
This revenge felt like nirvana.
""I killed him, Tasha!""
""I killed my own brother!""
""What should we do?""
""Should we call dad?""
As soon as Ron told me
that Monica knows everything..
..I decided that I should
tell everyone everything about you.
By now the video clips of Rajveer's
murder must have gone viral, everywhere.
Police too must have
found Rajveer's body.
The information is right.
We found the body.
In fact, the police will soon be here.
You will get arrested
for your brother's murder.
And with that, both the game
and the story will come to an end.
Calm down. Calm down.
- Please save my life.
- You are fine. It's okay.
Calm down,
you're going to be fine. Okay.
Okay..
- See what he did! So much of blood..
- We've called the doctor.
It's gonna be absolutely fine.
It's gonna be fine.
Madam, you are safe.
You are absolutely safe..
Okay madam, you are absolutely safe.
- Please take him away.
- Get up!
Alright. Let's out of here.
Officer..
I'm arresting you on suspicion
of the murder of your brother.
What? I haven't done anything!
- She's.. she's responsible!
- Alright.
Just listen to me.
- You speak to her.
- Just calm down, sir.
Come with us.
You can explain it all later.
- No!
- Come.
- I haven't done a single bloody thing.
- Sir!
- Let's go.
- Come on.
- Move.
- Calm down.
- Move. Move out of here.
- Come on!
- Come on.
- Come on. We have place for you.
'The nomination for the mayoral
election of business tycoon..'
'..Vikram Khurana has been cancelled.'
'The decision has been made on the bases
of the murder case in his family.'
'His elder son Aryan Khurana
is currently in police custody..'
'..charged for the murder
of his younger brother Rajveer..'
Aryan hasn't killed Rajveer, you have.
A father's job is not to fulfill
all whims and fancies of his sons.
It is to being them up right.
You are a father..
..who has given both..
life and death to his sons.
It is a father's duty
to protect his sons.
But I helped them for
my own selfish reasons.
And today..
I lost everything.
Name, fame, status..
And my sons.
You took revenge for a relationship.
And I chose myself over relationships.
Both a war and a game of chess
cannot be won without soldiers.
So Ron will be our
soldier in this war.
Yes, he's a soldier and a friend.
He will stay true to
his friendship and his duty.
Tasha, she is dead. We're alive.
Think about that.
Everything will be fine. Okay.
I couldn't spend my
life with your brother..
..but because of you, by helping you..
..I could finally take
revenge for his death.
No, Rishma.
If by taking advantage
of your education in UK..
..you hadn't made a place for yourself
in Aryan's company and his life..
..then our plan would
have never succeeded.
The bullets in that gun were fake and..
The move of Rishma's fake death
got Rajveer dead for real..
..and gave Aryan
a life worse than death.
Whatever you did,
you did for your brother, as a sister..
And I did it for my love.
And I am proud of him.
I am happy..
..that I gathered courage
to help you that day..
..by giving you their
names and identities.
That night Ashwin had said..
That I must be someone's sister.
And today, I say..
That every sister should
have a brother like Ashwin.
And every brother..
Should get a sister like you.",51425
"16","tt10324144","Article 15",2019,"Plot

In the village of Laalgaon in Uttar Pradesh, two Dalit girls are seen trapped in a school bus by some men. Ayan Ranjan, a St. Stephen's College, Delhi graduate and an Indian Police Service officer, is assigned to Laalgaon as the Additional Superintendent of Police and is warmly welcomed by officers Brahmadatt Singh and Kisan Jatav. Ayan encounters various forms of caste discrimination as soon as he arrives in the village, and periodically shares what he observes with his wife, Aditi, over the phone. Local villagers come to Ayan's reception asking the officers to find the missing girls but are turned down. Ayan reunites with his college friend Satyendra Rai, also a state government employee, who behaves suspiciously throughout the night.

The next morning, the girls are found hanging from a tree, while a third girl, Pooja, is reported missing. Ayan orders Brahmadatt to file an FIR and to obtain the postmortem report for the deceased girls. The girls' autopsy yields evidence that they were gang raped, but Brahmadatt prevents the release of this information and instead pushes a narrative suggesting that the girls, who were cousins, were lesbian lovers in an incestuous relationship and thus hanged by their fathers in an honour killing. Meanwhile, Jatav and a junior officer are threatened and their vehicle set on fire by followers of Nishad, leader of Bhim Sangharsh Sena (BSS), a group of activists within the village who seek speedy justice for the crime. Ayan questions Jatav about this the next day and becomes determined to solve the case.

Gaura, Pooja's sister, informs Ayan that the girls used to work for a local builder named Anshu Naharia. He slapped Pooja after the girls asked him for a raise in their salary of 3 rupees. Ayan decides to call Anshu for inquiry, even though Brahmadatt tries to persuade him not to do so, as Anshu is the son of local Minister Ramlal Naharia. During his interrogation, Anshu says that he slapped the girls in order to remind their entire caste about their place in society. Ayan, disgusted by the moral corruption of the village and its police force, posts on the police bulletin board a copy of Article 15 of the Constitution of India, which prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, caste, or birthplace.

Ayan meets with Dr. Malti Ram, a member of a scheduled caste and the assistant coroner who performed the autopsy, and finds out that contrary to her official report, the girls were raped and then murdered. He asks her to go to Lucknow to examine the DNA samples and to contact only him, realizing that local law enforcement is conspiring with Ramlal Naharia to cover up the case. Meanwhile, Mahantji, a Brahmin politician contesting in the local election, has formed an alliance with the head of the Laalgaon Dalit community in a show of inter-caste unity, but Nishad sees the display as a disingenuous political ploy and plans to protest it. Ayan tries to persuade Nishad to call off the protest, so he has men to help search for Pooja; Nishad refuses, but allows some of his men to aid Ayan's search.

Ayan soon gets a call from Malti, who confirms that Anshu was among those who gang-raped and murdered the two girls. Ayan gets an arrest warrant for Anshu and raids his house, but Anshu is not present. However, Ayan spots a school bus that was seen by local villagers around the time of the girls' disappearance, and investigates the nearby school (which is owned by Anshu), where he finds evidence from the scene of the girls' torture and rape. Elsewhere, Anshu is staying under protection from Brahmadatt, who is revealed to be one of the rapists. Brahmadatt kills Anshu to save himself.

Panikar, a high-ranking CBI officer, arrives in Laalgaon and suspends Ayan from the case. Ayan refuses to give up and tracks down Satyendra, who admits that he was at a party hosted by Anshu the night of the crime, and that he witnessed Anshu, Brahmadatt, and police officer Nihal Singh (who works closely with Ayan) rape the girls while severely drunk and later hang their dead bodies. Ayan confronts Nihal, who commits suicide out of remorse.

Jatav arrests Brahmadatt on Ayan's command. Panikar attempts to threaten Ayan into dropping the case, but Ayan reveals he has already submitted all his evidence to the Home Minister, and sharply criticizes the bigotry and injustice against people of lower castes among Indian law enforcement. Ayan then leads other officers through a large swamp in search of Pooja. They emerge on the other side in a jungle where they find a severely dehydrated Pooja hiding inside a pipe. They rescue her, and with her statement, Brahmadatt gets eleven years of imprisonment as punishment. Mahantji wins the election hands down.",4743,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt10324144.srt","Official YIFY movies site:
You'll get offended if I tell the truth
Rich people live in palaces
With a shining chandelier hanging
From their roof
We live in a hut
It's just a small hut
Just a storm is enough to blow it away
Rich people enjoy delicious food
They even buy mineral water
We make do on chutney and bread
We drink unfiltered water
Rich people's kids go to big schools
And colleges
They also take extra classes
While our kids toil hard
They say studies won't help them

When Lord Rama was
journeying back to Ayodhya
the villages on the way were lit
with lamps to welcome Him.
Except one village. It was dark.
My mother told me
that Lord Rama did notice it.
He stopped and asked the villagers:
""Why is it so dark?""
The villagers replied:
""We lit lamps to welcome you.
There was a sudden storm
and all the lamps went out.
We noticed
how Your palace shone in the dark.
So we embraced the darkness.""
The Indian countryside
is beautiful, Aditi.
Perhaps it's sucked
all the oxygen in Delhi.
Pull over, Chandrabhan.
Get me a bottle of water.
This is a Pasi village, sir.
-So?
-They're lower caste, sir.
They breed pigs.
We don't drink water they touch.
We can't touch them.
Even their shadows can't fall on us.
Nihal Singh, get me one.
My driver says even their shadows
are forbidden to fall upon us.
A scheduled caste village.
What's funny?
Our moms had separate dishes
for the maids not so long ago.
They're looking at me
like the British are back.
Yes, page 7.
But it's just a slice of India.
Here we go again!
The right turn takes you to Ayodhya.
Lucknow is straight ahead.
Turn left at the freeway
and it's straight on to Kolkata.
A lot of development here.
Are they building a mall?
No, it's for Mahantji's ashram.
A multiplex ashram!
Circle Officer Brahmadatt.
In fact, Brahmadatt Singh, sir.
This way, sir.
Hail India, sir.
SI Kisan Jatav, sir.
Ajay Singh, sir.
Rajesh Mishra.
Pramod Yadav.
She's Nihal Singh's younger sister.
A great cook.
If you don't mind, sir,
she'll serve you.
He is... Yadav. And he is--
Greetings, sir.
Welcome to Laalgaon.
Anshu Naharia, sir.
He's a respected contractor.
Your toilet needed repair.
I suggested we should get a new one.
He does a lot of work for us,
government roads, railways, etc.
Anshu has built many nice
public toilets for us.
The SP has a party planned
for you this evening.
Why not freshen up, sir?
You'll get to meet everyone
before he leaves Laalgaon.
I do declare
the Neem tree is no less than
the sandalwood tree.
Our Laalgaon police station is
as good as the city of London!
-Nihal Singh, is this party for me?
-Yes, sir.
Welcome, Mr. Ayan Ranjan.
I'm Mayank.
He got the idea of buying single malt

-Same thing.
This way. Come, come.
Sisters and brothers,
we have with us our new

Mr. Ayan Ranjan.
Ranjan. Ranjan. Ranjan.
Applause!
I declare...
The moon shines after years.
The fun starts
now that you're here.
Cover it properly.
I'm a fan of his book.
Is your father a writer, sir?
A very senior IFS officer.
He wrote a book after he retired.
Ayan, you must've studied abroad?
No, sir. I graduated in Delhi.
St Stephens.
I was in Europe and then Dad ordered
me to return. So I came back.
Your first posting? Laalgaon!
-Sir, it's a punishment.
-Punishment?
-Did you fall out with someone?
-No, sir. It was out of affection.
I said: ""Cool, sir"" to Shastriji.
Madanlal Shastri.
The Home Secretary in Delhi.
You said: ""Cool, sir"" to him?
He said something
at the graduation party
and I replied:
""Cool, sir.""

He paused for two seconds then said:
""Cool!""
Here's 20 rupees from Bachchu Rai

I thank you all.
There's a canteen behind the station.
They serve amazing food.
SP Subodhji never needed food

Your office is over there.
Is that Satyendra Rai?
Yes, sir. Do you know him?
Of course. He's a good friend.
We studied together in Delhi.
Was he in the IAS too? He's an officer
of the Pollution Control Board.
-Shall I call him?
-Let's go.
Satyendra.
Don't you recognize him?
You should thank him for the drinks.
I recognized him, sir.
Congratulations, Additional Commissioner.
How are you?
He is talking to you.
I'll be back, sir.
-He's had one too many.
-He was a good friend.
Oh no, they're back again.
Excuse me, sir.
-What?
-You will find them if you try.
-You mean right now?
-At least lodge our complaint.
What's going on?
I must work on Shastri.
It's like Bollywood in 1980s.
Wait for a couple of days.
If you could talk to the CBI...
Buzz off! You don't belong here!
Okay, Ayan.
I'm off. My flight's at 5 tomorrow.
Laalgaon is in your hands now.
I'll do my best, sir.
Thank you. Thank you.
All the best.
Look after Mr. Ayan.
Oh, Brahmadattji!
-Who are they?
-They're from a nearby village, sir.
They skin animals and sell the hides
to the tannery.
What's the problem?
Nothing. It's the usual, sir.
They say three of their girls
have been missing for two days.
-Have you filed a report?
-We're making enquiries, sir.
Happens all the time.
Their girls run away
and then come back.
-What's their nearest police station?
-Ours, sir.
Not from my dish, sir.
I'll get you another dish.
Bring some ""mangauri"" for sir.
Hurry up!
This fool, Satyendra.
I'm fine.
Let me drop you.
I haven't driven a bike in years.
Jatav, look here!
-Don't you go!
-Tell Chandrabhan to follow them.
Make it quick!
He's leaving on the motorcycle.
Follow them!
Hurry!
I worked very hard too.
But you did better.
I knew you'd clear the tests.
Stop!
Where are you running away?
Hey!
-He's drunk.
-Stop!
Stop!
Rascal, come here.
Are you Bulan's son?
What's this?
Go on! Squat!
It's nothing, sir.
He's the confectioner's son.
He had a kitchen knife on him.
-Let's go, sir.
-Okay.
I didn't think you'd recognize me.
Why wouldn't I?
We're home.
How is Aditi?
Does she still call you a foreigner?
She doesn't say it, but thinks it.
She does good work.
Gender equality, human rights.
Her articles get published.
We talk often.
Talk often? What do you mean?
These days,
we argue more than we talk.
She still thinks of me
as her college boyfriend.
Listen. Don't let Aditi go.
You'll never find another girl
like her in your lifetime.
Here we go!
Greetings, sister-in-law.
-I'm Ayan.
-Greetings.
She knows you.
Archana, you heard us?
-Please come inside.
-Some other time.
See you later.
Listen, sonny!
We haven't even hugged!
Oh, shucks!
Sorry to wake you up so early, sir.
You must've slept late last night.
We've photographed them.
The missing girls?
They've been missing for two days,
since the 12th.
They were cousins.
The third girl was a friend
from Laalgaon.
The villagers said
the cousins were intimate.
Lesbians.
-Their fathers hung them.
-Where are the fathers?
We're investigating.
-Has anyone given a statement?
-No, sir. But they will.
-The third girl?
-No sign of her, sir.
We've called an ambulance.
We'll send the bodies
for the postmortem and file a report.
-Nihal.
-Sir.
Careful, sir!
Jatav, can't you untie the knot?
Pull the body up and undo
the knot around her neck.
If you pull her up,
you can't untie the knot.
Shall I cut it?
Then she'll drop to the ground.
Don't you know physics?
What shall we do?
Shit. They were children. Only 15.
One girl is still missing.
It's just like the wild, wild west.
Hello, are you there?
Yes. Last week a girl's body
was found in Rajasthan. In Sikar.
Looks like rape, but they claim
it was a case of honor killing.
-Are these girls Dalits?
-Yes.
Why isn't this news reported
with the GDP headlines?
It does get reported.
Remember the Nirbhaya outrage?
But why can't the Laalgaon
or Sikar cases hit the headlines?
Why should you decide about Laalgaon?
We'll only know
after the investigation.
You can't just publish
that it's rape based on rumors.
That's not what I was saying.
You're defending the system.
Don't honor killings happen?
I thought I could share it with you.
But you don't believe in moderation.
You want me to be an activist,
but law-abiding.
You want a hero, Aditi.
No, Ayan. I want someone
who doesn't wait for a hero.
Glory to India.
Sir, will your lunch come from home?
We've ordered something
from the canteen for you.
Pramod and Mishra want to see you
for a briefing, sir.
Mayank!
Chandrabhan, hurry up.
-Mayank!
-Sir.
Why is the fan so noisy?
I'll get it fixed, sir.
Why didn't you register their complaint?
-It didn't seem serious, sir.
-When is it serious?
These people keep reporting
false cases.
In January a boy ran away
and we had to report it
as a kidnapping.
-Then these people...
-""These"" people?
File the missing girl's report. Now.
Yes, sir.
-Ask Pramod and what's his name?
-Mishra.
Send them in.
Move back!
She was from Laalgaon.
Step back!
Move!
Move it! This isn't a circus.
-Get Dr. Awdhesh on the line.
-He's down with malaria, sir.
Who'll do the postmortem? You?
His assistant Dr. Malti Ram will do it.
Oh God! Long live
the reformer Dr. Ambedkar!
-Mr. Navin of Prabhat News is waiting.
-OK. Go.
By hanging the girls
he's just attracted the media.
Come!
Good boy.
There you go.
My sonny!
Write.
It's a case of honor killing.
The girls were cousins.
They were too close.
Bad influences everywhere these days.
Their fathers found out. They could not
take it, so they hung them.
Listen.
I'm not saying this.
Other people have made statements.
Get it?
Got it.
Very well.
The village is calm, sir.
Tomorrow's papers will say
it was a case of honor killing.
-You talked to a journalist?
-No, sir.
-What about the postmortem report?
-Soon, sir.
But it won't tell us anything new.
I want to avoid delays, sir.
Or their leader, Shanti Prasad,
will start a strike.
In power, they build statues
of themselves.
Out of power,
they turn into lower caste Dalits.
-Tell me when you get the report.
-Okay, sir.
-We must find that girl.
-What girl, sir?
How many villages besides Harimanpur
are there near the tree?
Two, sir. Bichhiya and Chhatni.
Find out if anyone saw anything.
You two meet me at home.
Stop the car.
Nihal Singh, listen.
I can't get through to Satyendra Rai.
Go to his house.
Phone me when you know what's going on.
Okay, sir.
Come on, move back!
Sir, the older girl, Shanu,
was my daughter.
And the younger girl, Mamta,
was Mahendar's daughter.
Our daughters were killed, sir.
And they're framing us.
-I'm sorry.
-You should be, sir.
What's your name?
Gaura.
Pooja is her sister, sir.
Please find Pooja.
We beg you.
Don't we have a glass?
They won't drink from a glass
in your presence, sir.
Had they kept our girls all night and...
freed them later, it would've been okay.
But they hung them from a tree.
If someone had listened to us,
our girls would still be alive.
Let me see the postmortem report first.
Anshu Naharia slapped Pooja.
That's why Brahmadatt
didn't file a report.
Shanu and Pooja were working
on a road construction project.
They asked for a three-rupee raise.
-How much?
-Three rupees.
The daily wage was 25.
They wanted 28.
The other children then refused
to work for under 28 rupees.
When Anshu slapped Pooja,
the others stopped working.
They worked at the tannery instead
for 28 rupees a day.
Did any kids work for 25 rupees?
After he slapped her, a few kids left.
Amali.
The curtain's the wrong way round.
The print should face the room.
Everything will look
white in the office.
Yes?
Gaura used to study at our school.
I studied in Harimanpur till class 9.
My father worked at the school.
That's how I know her.
-And yet you didn't report it?
-I was busy with the Kanpur case.
-And Brahmadatt told us...
-Is it filed now?
Yes, sir.
Jatav, we must find the missing girl.
Get the details from Gaura.
Check Pooja's phone records.
Take statements from her neighbors
and family.
Talk to the tannery supervisor.
What time did she leave work
on the 12th? Who with?
Where was Anshu on the 12th and 13th?
These girls and boys
return home sometimes.
To be honest, sir, whatever
we do for these people...
Who are ""these"" people?
Are they from Jupiter?
""They"" this, ""they"" that.
Who are ""these"" people who come and go?
Or hang themselves from trees?
Sir, I was...
Come. Let's go.
What did he say?
-Was he swearing at us?
-No. He asked us to go.
Let's go to the tannery. It's late.
Please come.
Put it on the table.
Yes, brother.
Shall I make okra tonight?
Or marrow? Cottage cheese?
-Make whatever you cook well.
-I cook everything well.
-Are you Nihal Singh's sister?
-Yes.
-Did you go to school?
-Till class 8.
Now I'm learning Inglish.
Not Inglish, it's English.
Call it what you want, brother.
Understanding is what counts.
Anshu Naharia has sent
a mutton curry for you.
I'm making marrow with parathas.
Yes, Nihal Singh?
Satyendra is out, sir.
His wife is here. Shall I put her on?
Okay.
Hello! Where's Satyendra?
He left home early.
His phone is switched off.
-Did he say anything before he left?
-No.
He got up at 4 a.m. and just drove off.
-But I dropped him home at midnight.
-He slept for awhile.
He got a call and then he was gone.
Long live India!
Nihal Singh
What are you doing here?
The boss sent me to Satyendra's house.
And?
He hasn't returned home.
I see.
How much longer for the
postmortem report?
The Addl. Commissioner keeps asking:
""Where's the report?""
-Not long now, sir.
-It doesn't look like it.
-It'll get done, sir.
-Come on!
Doctor, the CO.
Mr. Brahmadatt Singh.
I'm making a provisional report.
The final one will take time.
What's in the report?
Rape, gang rape.
They were raped repeatedly for days.
Two or three days.
Then hung alive.
Have you spoken to Dr Awdhesh?
-Yes.
-And?
I can't do what he's asking.
You're reacting emotionally, Maltiji.
I advise you to write a few poems
on your Facebook page.
You'll feel better.
But don't write anything here.
I'm just doing my job.
-Your work is amazing.
-Dr Awdhesh on the line.
Doctor, what's this?
The women's movement
has taken over here.
Now will you write up
the postmortem report?
How will we control this district?
If the Additional Commissioner
sees the report,
your malaria will be replaced
by jaundice.
You'll die a mysterious death.
Understand?
Get up! Enough of your malaria.
Get well soon.
This is the quota system for you!
The girls were from scheduled caste.
And so is the doctor.
Our taxes paid for her education.
-Yes.
-Get it?
I told you to disappear
for a while.
Come back in four months
when all is calm and the case is closed.
But you people never listen.
Okay.
Come.
You kept me away from you, my love
What mistake did I commit?
You know the trouble
with the lower caste?
I'm an insider.
I've watched them for 40 years.
As soon as one of us becomes a cop,
they take us for their
action hero, Ajay Devgan.
""The rascal cop will help us now.""
Gaura's got it in for you.
If you live in the slums where you shit
and eat in the same place,
where animal hides rot
-can girls be safe there?
-No way.
Look at history.
Have girls ever been safe?
These people never change.
Must I risk everything and become
a reformer like Raja Ram Mohan Rai?
Mayank, you know how I've struggled
to get anywhere in our society.
Yes, I know.
You saw me sweeping the school floors.
Jump, Jatav!
You scum!
Who is it? Come out.
Nokhai! You dare attack the police?
Now you're the big cop!
Not one of us now?
-There's been a murder.
-So you want to kill me?
We don't believe in killing.
And you won't kill me.
Put your gun down.
Take the shortcut through Bichhiya.
The bridge has been reopened.
Sir, Pramod said you wanted
to see the old police files.
Who's Anshu Naharia's friend here?
He's rich and the councilor's friend.
So he's everybody's friend.
His father was a politician.
He's powerful, sir.
He was close to Subodh Lal,
the officer before you.
And Brahmadatt?
-Him, too.
-And Jatav?
Jatav!
He's a zero.
He doesn't count for anything.
He may not do the right thing,
but he won't do anything wrong.
I'm sorry. I think I was overreacting.
You wear fancy clothes,
speak good English, traveled the world
maybe that's not the real you.
You became a civil servant
because of your Dad.
You may become an activist
because of me.
You don't want to discover
your true self.
If you don't know yourself,
how can you know me?
You were right.
I will do my best.
I look at everyone's face
Hoping someone will call out to me
Don't leave me
My little girl please come back
To your father
Your fight is over
Oh, lord
Your father is crying his heart out
Nanku!
Mahendar! Let's go.
Your mother is stunned
Like she lost something precious
Let's go.
-Let's go.
-Where are you taking them?
What have they done?
What have they done?
Where are you going?
We were returning from the tannery
after enquiring about the missing girl.
When suddenly a fireball made of jute...
No, no, write:
We were bombarded by fireballs
and the jeep caught fire.
So we jumped out.
I told Mayank to run.
We ran in all directions.
Who was the rascal? Sorry.
We looked everywhere. It was dark.
No one was there. We saw no one.
We kept running through the fields.
We had no torch.
I reached for my cell phone.
If the fireball was thrown at the jeep,
they must've been very close, Jatav.
But you saw no one?
Sir, their faces were covered.
So?
You had a gun.
They had a gun, too.
Did anyone fire?
No one fired, sir.
Why not?
You've made a false statement.
Sign it.
Sign it.
Go on!
One minute.
-Anything else?
-That's all.
-Sir, Nishad...
-Shut up!
They were Nishad's men, sir. BSS.
-Who's Nishad?
-A member of the Bhim Sangharsh Sena.
They said the police
asked the villagers
to make false statements
against the girls' fathers.
Did you have a hand in this, too?
Which side are you on, Jatav?
Whichever side you choose for me.
Bhim Sangharsh Sena, sir.
They were Nishad's boys.
He's their leader, sir.
He thinks he's the Dalit Robin Hood.
He was jailed last year.
There's a national security case
against him. He's on bail.
He's gone underground.
Let's close the case, sir.
The girls' fathers have been
granted custody for seven days.
Four villagers have made statements.
The fathers beat the girls.
That's why the case closed, sir.
-Where's the postmortem report?
-Coming, sir.
-The bodies have been buried.
-Buried?
Yes, sir. They usually bury girls
if they are minors.
I'll bring you the report this evening.
Case closed, sir.
Who is Anshu Naharia?
You've met him, sir.
He built the bathroom.
Call him to the office.
I want to talk to him.
You want to talk to Anshu?
About what, sir?
Let it go, sir.
Why get mixed up in all this?
If Anshu is implicated,
it'll lead to Ramlal Naharia.
The government's in his pocket, sir.
I beg you, sir,
don't disturb the balance.
Till I see the postmortem report,
I won't sign this.
I'm your well-wisher.
I beg you, sir.
I'm your well-wisher, sir.
It's like quicksand.
Don't probe too much, sir.
If you probe too much...
If we stir things up,
we won't be spared. I beg you, sir.
They won't spare us.
Are you crazy?
You really enjoy playing
the detective, don't you?
You didn't think you should
clear it with me first?
Why didn't you ask me?
He'll leave.
He'll be here for
a few months then he'll leave.
But you and I?
We have to live here. Survive!
Do you get it?
Haven't you heard of Ramlal Naharia?
Do you know what'll happen
if he's implicated?
Want to play the honest cop?
-Go, stop him!
-How can I?
If he questions me,
I'll have to answer him.
Did I speak to his predecessors?
I've stood by you all my life.
How can I say no to him?
You talk to him.
Take me to Harimanpur.
My mother used to say...
our society is built upon certain laws.
There's a king and his subjects.
Attendants and servants.
Society has a balanced order that was
created by Lord Brahma. In Sanskrit.
We have no right to upset
this balance.
And, sir if everyone is equal,
who'll be the king?
If everyone is equal,
who'll be the king?
Why have a king at all?
Who knows Nishad?
Maatadeen, Shishupaal,
Lachcha and Deenu Daama.
They have all given statements.
Where are they?
We haven't seen them since yesterday.
Stop!
I know Nishad.
Mayank and Jatav could've been killed.
They didn't mean to kill them.
Do you work with Nishad?
I was going to marry him.
If they didn't mean to kill the cops,
why attack them?
""It takes a loud voice
to make the deaf hear.""
Bhagat Singh said that in 1929.
I studied civics till ninth grade.
Nishad understood it better
than he should have.
We're looking for your sister Pooja.
The police don't even have her photo.
Morning, sir.
Sorry, sir.
They'll fix it tomorrow.
Satyendra's wife is here, sir.
-Has he left home like this before?
-No.
I'm very worried.
Any friends or family nearby?
He hardly meets anyone.
And Anshu Naharia?
They meet sometimes
for some work or other.
Mayank, take her number.
Find out who called at 4 a.m.
Tap the caller's number.
Find his location.
You'd better go home.
I'll call you.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Easy.
Tap her phone as well.
It happens every day, sir.
Brahmadatt's at the hospital now.
He can take care of it.
Good excuse to go to the hospital.
Meet the doctor too.
Did you perform the girls' postmortem?
Yes.
Dr Awdhesh will write the report.
I'm going on leave.
Were they raped?
It was a gang-rape.
Over two or three days.
What difference does it make?
It makes a difference,
but if you go on leave.
Have you the courage to stay?
I'll stand by you.
Give me a provisional report.
Keep the girls' DNA samples.
We'll have them tested.
You'll come to no harm.
It hurts!
Shut up!
Why are you shouting?
-So you dare sit and eat in the temple?
-We did not eat there, sir.
It's the truth, sir.
We did not eat in the temple.
Sir!
Any names?
No, sir. But they described
the boys who hit them.
-Round up the suspects.
-Sir.
Take their statements. I'm coming.
Too sweet! Chandrabhan has diabetes.
-It burnt my tongue.
-Sir.
Sorry, sir.
What about the temple?
-Aren't Dalits allowed to enter?
-Right, sir.
Who beat them up?
-Boys from Mahantji's ashram.
-Who is Mahantji?
Mahantji is Mahantji.
-He's upper caste?
-A Brahmin, sir.
-And those young men?
-Scheduled caste, sir.
-What caste is Brahmadatt?
-Thakur, sir.
So are Thakurs considered to be
Brahmins, Kshatriyas or Vaishyas?
They're Kshatriyas, sir.
What are you?
I am a Jat.
Now called OBC, ""Other Backward Class.""
So why are you still protesting?
I'm not, sir.
The Haryana Jats are protesting.
They're still considered Jats.
-Jatav, aren't you a Dalit?
-Yes, sir.
-Same caste as the injured boys?
-No, sir.
I'm a Chamar. They were Pasis.
We're much higher than them.
We have nothing to do with them.
We don't eat the food they touch.
-And I can't eat the food you touch?
-Right, sir.
Right?
-And what caste are you?
-A Kayasth, sir.
What's a Kayasth?
We're different. We don't fall into
the four main castes.
-And me?
-A Brahmin, sir.
-So am I Mahantji's equal?
-No, no, sir.
He's a Kanyakubja Brahmin, a top Brahmin.
You're a Saryuparin.
-What the fuck is going on here?
-Okay, sir.
Just a second!
Jatavji, what's wrong?
Why did you leave?
-Didn't he tell us to go?
-When did he say that?
Didn't he say ""fuck""?
-Doesn't that mean ""go?""
-Come on.
Jatav!
How far is Harimanpur?
There, sir. About two kms.
And the tannery?
Just beyond Chhatni village.
About 5 kms away.
What's that?
Ignore it, sir.
Sir!
Dead animals are brought here,
skinned and sold to the tannery.
Their work used to run smoothly
but now there's the strike.
Because those boys were beaten,
Nishad has stopped the men
from his caste from working.
They've alerted everyone on WhatsApp.
You and I are invisible to them.
Though they depend entirely on us.
We work on their farmlands.
We clean up their shit.
We deliver their babies.
We burn their corpses on funeral pyres.
Now we're done with begging
for justice.
Stop working now!
You won't find her in the fields, sir.
It's been three days.
The fields may look big,
but a farmer knows every foot of his land.
Will we ever find her?
We must keep looking.
That's the tannery.
The girls went home this way.
This is called the ""pig swamp.""
It's filthy.
Pigs used to wallow in it.
They were three girls.
Why kill only two?
Pooja!
Pooja!
Pooja!
A pink slipper was listed
in the report.
Can the swamp be crossed barefoot?
It's deep in places, sir.
No one would dare cross it
at night.
What's on the other side?
What's on the other side?
Fields are on this side.
Jungle's on the other.
-How big is the jungle?
-About three or four kms, sir.
How does one get there?
Why go there, sir?
-How does one get there?
-We don't go there, sir.
Long live Bhim!
Who did this?
Glory to India.
The cleaner didn't show up.
They're on strike, sir.
They're dumping waste
outside government offices.
Yes, sir. He's here.
I'll put him on.
Ramlalji!
Himself, sir!
Sir?
Yes.
Of course, sir.
So shall I close the case, sir?
How are you?
You're up early.
I couldn't sleep.
Did you feel again
that you had landed on Mars?
What do three rupees buy, Aditi?
What?
Can three rupees buy anything?
What's wrong, Ayan?
The girls were raped
and murdered for three rupees.
When I was growing up in Europe,
people would say:
""India, India, India.""
I'd sell the Taj Mahal or Khajuraho
as though it was my family property.
Two girls are dead. One's missing.
No one's bothered.
People here think it's happening
in some other country.
Everywhere, on TV, in cities,
life goes on. We ignore reality.
We must find new words, new ways.
Because this mess is ancient.
As per the Indian Constitution,
Article 15
the State shall not discriminate
against any citizen
The Constitution of India, 1950
on the grounds of religion, race,
caste, sex or birth place.
The use of wells, tanks,
bathing places, roads
and the access to
any public property
will not be subject to any disability,
liability, restriction or condition.
Mother, I bow to thee!
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams
Cool with thy winds of delight
Dark fields waving Mother of might
Mother free
Mother, I bow to thee!
MISSING
GIRL MISSING
The three girls used to take
this road from the tannery.
They stopped at the shop,
bought some snacks
and left.
Did you see anyone after that?
-A bus drove by later.
-What bus?
A yellow bus, sir.
Which bus line's yellow?
No buses come here, sir.
Brothers and sisters, everyone!
Join us at the Brahman-Dalit Unity Rally.
And you will hear Mahantji
and Shanti Prasad
share their thoughts about this unity.
Mahantji is doing it
for his personal interests.
Nishad opposes this rally.
These girls have become
the main issue in this election.
-May I?
-Go ahead.
Hello. Yes.
Yes, all right.
Okay, okay.
It was Bachchu Rai
who called Satyendra at 4 a.m.
-He repairs bikes.
-Get him in at once.
-Mahantji!
-Long live!
This is the new Uttar Pradesh. A Brahmin
and Dalit eating off the same plate.
I bow to you, Goddess of Plenty.
It helped heal the village's grief
when Mahantji shared a meal
with the Dalit leader
Shanti Prasad in Harimanpur.
He ate with the girls' family
and reassured them.
The rapists are being protected
by the politician Ramlal Naharia.
Instead of arresting the culprits,
our government
is framing the girls' fathers.
Because they're Dalits
and the government is against Dalits.
If we are to save
Hindu traditions and religion
and save Hindus, we must unite.
Dalits and Brahmins must unite as one.
This is just the start.
-To our union!
-Long live!
-Jatavji!
-Sir.
-How long will it take?
-They've been working for two hours.
The more we drain the gutter,
the more filth pours out.
-How many men work here?
-Here, sir?
How many men work for us?
With the cleaners, we're 20.
-And at the Haulpur police station?
-About 12 or 13 men.
-In Chhatni?
-About 20, sir.
-Tomorrow at 6 a.m.
-Yes, sir.
-I want to see everyone at the swamp.
-Yes, sir.
We'll make our way into the jungle.
We'll search from the tannery
to Harimanpur.
Yes, sir.
Anshu Naharia is here, sir.
Sir, you guys get transferred,
but we get killed.
All we need is your signature.
Are all the Delhi files above board?
Ramlal Naharia asked for your number.
He'll be calling you.
Why did you hit the girls?
They wanted a raise.
So you hit them?
First, I refused them.
So why hit them?
They were going to quit working.
So you hit them?
The others would've demanded
a raise or stopped work too.
All work would stop.
Your milk would not get delivered.
You'd have to clean the sewers.
Cobble your own shoes.
If we didn't keep them in their place,
no work would get done.
What is their place?
The place we give them, sir.
And what I earn tells you
my place in society.
Everyone has their status, sir.
Where were you on the night of 12th?
At home. The 12th, 13th, 14th.
I'm home every night, sir.
Friends drop by.
I have many friends.
Everywhere.
Malti, examine this man.
We need a medical report.
Or Ramlalji might claim
we beat Anshu. Right?
We must maintain the balance. Right?
Very well, sir.
Please go to Lucknow.
Test the girls' DNA samples.
My man will accompany you.
Will you go?
Yes, sir.
Call me, no one else.
Jatav, do you know any journalist
who'd write against Ramlal Naharia?
Yes, sir.
Leak some news to the press:
""Anshu is our prime suspect.""
The headlines tomorrow must say
Anshu is Ramlalji's close ally.
Doable?
It'll be done, sir.
The local papers are publishing
an article tomorrow.
Try and get it published wherever you can.
Are you okay?
Sir, Bachchu Rai.
Come inside.
You called him at 4 a.m?
He owed me money, sir.
Satyendra used to get his bike
repaired by him.
He owed Bachchu money.
So you call him at 4 a.m?
My family was leaving for Lucknow
on the 6 a.m. train.
He promised to pay me
the night before, but didn't.
That's why I called so early.
But there was no sign of him.
Keep an eye on him.
-There must be CCTV in Anshu's house.
-No CCTV in Laalgaon, sir.
-Only banks have it.
-Is there one near his place?
-I'll check, sir.
-Get me the footage if there is.
Amali, can you make me some tea?
Amali!
Tripathi.
-Tripathi!
-Yes, sir.
Where's Amali?
Out shopping, sir.
-Where?
-At the market.
-Vegetable market?
-Yes, sir.
Phone her.
-I tried. She didn't answer.
-Why didn't you tell me?
I thought she'd be back.
Don't you know what
this place is like?
Call her brother Nihal.
Ask if he's heard from her.
Call Nihal Singh. Now!
Get the car out.
I'll look for her.
-I'll go, sir.
-No, I will.
Where were you?
Sir, we had to submit
a form for her exam.
Today was the last day.
We went to get a photo taken.
Will anyone show up?
The upper caste will never
step into this swamp, sir.
And Nishad has asked the lower caste
workers to go on strike.
I thought the villagers would come.
-Are you all scheduled caste?
-No, sir.
I'm a Yadav. We await your orders.
No orders. We need your help.
We need many men.
We must break the strike.
I want to meet Nishad.
Nishad? He's gone underground.
Find him.
I've swept this place for ten years.
When we were 11,
the principal caught Jatav
with a love letter.
We kids watched as Jatav's father
ran after him with a stick.
I'll never forget that day!
It was a just a plot!
But his father made delicious porridge.
It's Malti, sir.
Anshu raped the girls.
His DNA is a match.
I'll be back tomorrow with the report.
Send it to me on WhatsApp.
Call when you're here.
Let's go to bus station.
We were taught a bunch of lies.
Maybe that's why the school
didn't last.
Here I am, sir.
Send the men back to work, Nishad.
We need people to look for Pooja.
Why bother looking for her?
Just find Pooja's father and frame him.
Nishad, aunt has sent halwa for you.
It was his birthday the day before.
The boy was a gem, sir.
No one would believe it if Nishad
was given 90 out of a 100.
Because Nishad could never score
below 100.
If he was a gem of a boy,
why he's rebelling now?
You've become so negative.
If you were negative,
would they accuse you of being
a threat to national security?
There's a right way of doing things.
Jatav's father was a sweeper
in our school.
And my father was a teacher.
Today we're equals.
We earn the same wage.
Hasn't Jatav made a place for himself?
-Has nothing changed in 70 years?
-Yes, it has.
Sometimes we're called Untouchable
citizens or scheduled caste citizens.
But we're never counted as just citizens
so we would be counted as equals.
You've studied too much.
I may not know a lot.
But every community
has its problems, Nishad.
Gaura was hired to cook at a school.
The very first day the kids refused
to eat the meal she made.
Food for 150 kids was thrown away.
Did anyone throw away the food you touch?
Or wash their hands
after they shook yours?
Every community has its problems,
but your bones aren't broken
if you enter a temple.
Mahant was invited by Shanti Prasad
to eat with all the villagers.
But the food and plates came from
his home. They didn't say that on TV.
Does Shanti Prasad do nothing
for you all?
He did once. That's why I worked
with him for so many years.
But I soon realized
power is a creed in itself.
He rose in politics by stepping
on our shoulders.
Now he thinks of us as dirt.
So I started to rebel.
Last year,
Shanti Prasad's men attacked us.
My guru's return gift.
This rally is to manipulate our votes.
I won't let that happen.
Nishad, I'm doing my best.
At least as much as I can.
-Will I win or lose? I need your help...
-They won't let you succeed, sir.
They ignore the Constitution
though they swear by it.
That's the fight, Nishad.
They must follow the Constitution.
That's the only way.
That's what Dr Ambedkar said.
Dr Ambedkar also said:
""If I find the Constitution being misused,
I shall be the first to burn it.""
We found Pooja's slipper
near the swamp.
I've got to find her.
We won't stop the anti-rally protest,
but your men will be there.
Look at this filth.
-Glory to India.
-Glory to India.
She must've eaten something bad.
Animals don't understand.
Give her an injection.
Jatav, we're going to arrest Anshu now.
Excuse me?
Mayank! Get me the warrant.
If you don't mind, sir.
We just heard from Lucknow. The case
has been transferred to the CBI.
Good, sir. You'll be rid of it.
-They'll manage the case.
-The warrant, sir.
Let's manage it ourselves first.
He's not at home, sir.
Search the house.
Yes, sir.
He's gone, sir.
What's that?
A school, sir.
-Who does the school belong to?
-Anshu Naharia.
-Come on.
-It's vacations, sir.
The school reopens in two weeks.
Here.
Unlock all the doors.
The keys to this room?
Sir has them.
-Who's got the keys?
-Mr. Anshu.
-Break it open!
-Sir.
Ten men will cross the swamp
and search the fields.
Ten men will search the jungle.
And the others will comb
every inch of the swamp.
Not so fast!
Some villagers are coming to help.
Come on! Let's start.
Get on with it.
Anshu has been named prime suspect
in the Harimanpur case
I've seen it.
Ramlalji must be angry.
He won't spare him.
Suspending him isn't enough.
We'll have the rascal arrested.
-Have you spoken to Ramlalji?
-No. His phone is switched off.
The CBI is involved now.
Yes, that's to be expected.
-Have you had your breakfast?
-No. They're making parathas for me.
The wheat crop is fantastic this year.
-You didn't have to kill them, Anshu.
-What?
You could've let the wretches go
after ten days.
They were causing trouble, sir.
Remember how the girl struggled
when Brahmadattji lay on her?
He dared to say I was on top of her!
I'll be finished if you get arrested.
We must close the case.
-Ramlal won't spare you.
-But he's let go of you.
You don't get it, do you?
Let's do it, Anshu.
Long live India!
-Mr. Panicker from the CBI is here, sir.
-Get him some tea.
Yes, sir.
Central Bureau of Investigation
Mr. Panicker
Dr Awdhesh?
Dr Awdhesh Laktakiya.
Dr Awdhesh, how long has Malti
worked as your assistant?
She's not an assistant, sir.
-Meaning?
-She's an assistant.
Though I'm in charge, sir.
You speak Hindi and English.
She has to type everything twice.
I went to arrest Anshu, sir.
He was hiding in his farmhouse.
He took a shot at me.
You were right, sir. He's a bad sort.
How are you, Mr. Ranjan?
It's been chaos since you arrived.
You are not familiar with our
complicated Indian customs, are you?
Are you uncomfortable in Hindi?
You prefer English.
In Hindi-speaking states
it would be preferable if you could
speak the local language.
You'd understand local customs
better that way.
A girl is still missing, sir.
Every minute's important.
The prime suspect is dead.
-Are you on meds?
-Sorry, sir?
Are you on medication?
You seem agitated.
-Sir, young girls were raped.
-Raped?
What makes you think that?
The doctor's first postmortem report.
The senior doctor's report
does not mention rape.
She did the postmortem
and the report says rape.
The girls' DNA samples were tested
and they matched the suspect's DNA.
Anshu Naharia's, sir.
The DNA test results
are not in my report.
Sir, I had the samples checked
personally.
WhatsApp messages can incite
lynching and riots too.
They say you're biased against
the scheduled caste.
When you arrived you asked
about everyone's caste.
Sir, I was trying to understand
why we follow a 2000-year-old system
in 2019?
Asking people their caste is an
offence under the SC/ST Act.
-You must know that?
-Yes, sir.
I suspect, Mr. Ayan Ranjan,
you're motivated by a personal agenda.
You want to disturb the peace here.
What do you think of the
Brahmin-Dalit Unity Rally?
Upper caste and lower caste
standing together against
the state government?
Do you want them to succeed?
The rally has nothing to do
with these people.
It never has.
They're very innocent, simple people.
They get influenced by sloganeering and
become part of the crowd in rallies.
Okay. Stop working on this case.
At once.
Anything you wish to say
in your defense
you may tell me tomorrow.
I know where Satyendra is.
I'm going to see him.
I'll stop after that.
Ayan, you've only just started.
-Are you arresting me?
-I must talk to you.
-Don't lie! You want to arrest me.
-No, I want to talk, Satyendra.
Let go. Leave me alone!
I just want to talk.
Why were you at Anshu's house
on the night of the 12th?
Do you know a IPS officer was beaten
to death in this very state?
I saw the CCTV footage from
the bank opposite his house.
You arrived first,
followed by a police jeep.
-What happened that night?
-You want to be Superman?
Where did you go at 4 a.m?
Why did Bachchu call you?
Why are you hiding now?
I'm being suspended,
but I'll do what I can now.
If that means arresting you
or shooting you.
I got a call at 4 a.m.
Anshu's car broke down.
He needed booster cables.
When I got there, they had just hung
the two girls from the tree.
I was told to lie low.
And on the 12th?
There was a party at Anshu's house.
I was there.
So were Brahmadatt and Nihal.
The girls were there, too.
They went into the school,
one by one.
Anshu raped them. So did Brahmadatt.
Rape.
Nihal Singh did, too.
I left.
Where's the third girl?
I don't know.
I thought maybe the three girls
had escaped that night.
Ayan, I won't make a statement.
Ask me in front of anyone
and I'll deny everything.
You'll stand witness.
You'll soon be suspended and sent away.
They'll kill me.
That's the way it is here.
And always will be.
You don't get it.
I'm leaving.
Shoot me in the back if you want to.
Finish it for me!
Where's Pooja, Nihal Singh?
I don't know, sir.
You did it, too?
He got us very drunk.
I was with Brahmadatt.
I did a bad thing, sir.
I sinned, sir.
I committed a shameless sin, sir.
Did Brahmadatt rape them?
Yes, sir.
Where's Pooja?
There were three girls, sir.
It's the truth, sir. I don't know.
-Where's Pooja, Nihal Singh?
-I don't know, sir.
Please forgive me.
I made a terrible mistake, sir.
Please forgive me.
Forgive me, sir.
Don't tell Amali.
If there's news of a rape that's
taken place in Badaun and Buland,
it feels far away from us.
But distance means nothing, sir.
Nihal used to...
sit a foot away from me.
For 12 long years.
Arrest Brahmadatt, Jatavji.
The Lucknow officers are waiting
with my suspension orders.
If I accept them,
my hands will be tied.
Mayank will bring the arrest warrant
to your house.
Sign it before you go in
and I'll manage the rest, sir.
I make a great potato curry.
And bitter gourd,
but it won't taste bitter.
My brother Nihal thinks
I make better kheer than our mother.
Tell me what you'd like to eat.
I'm not really hungry.
You and sir are never hungry.
Who can I cook for?
Sir does not sleep.
And what about you?
Brother's here.
I thought you might need me.
I do. A lot.
One minute.
Amali.
Do you know what rape is, child?
Ayan.
You know Shanu and Mamta were
hung from a tree?
Your brother Nihal raped them too.
He told me.
He's not coming back.
He told me not to tell you,
but you would have found out.
I don't know if it makes
any difference
but your brother knew
he'd done a bad thing.
We're here for you.
They can't stomach
our anti rally protest.
They're capable of anything.
I have to go away for a few months.
Before leaving, I'd like to see you.
Can you come?
Long live Bhim, Brother Binayak!
Nishad just got here.
Nokhai, take him to Patna
for a few days.
They're sending me to jail again.
They'll wear you out, Nishad.
They wear everyone out.
Sometimes I think it's hopeless.
But you can't admit that.
Because so many get strength from you.
But you can tell me though.
Sometimes I think about all the things
I wanted to do.
I wanted to bring you flowers.
But such terrible things
were happening around us.
It felt like a sin
to even smile at you.
There were so many terrible things
going on around us. I never got
five minutes to sit quietly near you,
with our feet dipped in the river.
I've never stared at the moon
for five minutes.
Or known five minutes' peace.
-Sir!
-Stop!
You've shown
where you truly belong, Jatav.
You're wearing a uniform
and working in an office because of me.
Scum! You should've stayed a sweeper.
You should collect garbage instead.
Move back!
How long must I be a sweeper?
Take him away.
Whenever Gaura speaks of Nishad,
there's a glint in her eye.
I felt sure
I lacked something because you
did not look at me like that. Ever.
Drive.
Move.
MISSING
-Mahantji!
-Long live!
This is the land of Shabri's Lord Rama.
This is the land of Kevat's Lord Rama.
I wanted to be a writer.
And a scientist.
I thought I'd write about science.
But it came to nothing.
Because the place I was born into
was a terrible accident.
Whatever caste you belong to,
it's time for Hindus to unite.
Time to recognize the true enemy.
Men martyred at the border
are outnumbered by those
who die cleaning the sewers.
No one mourns for them.
We made a terrible mistake, sir.
Our daughters became wayward.
We tried explaining to them but they
didn't listen to us, so we killed them.
If anything happens to me,
it'll enrage you.
Make that anger your weapon.
But make sure you use
no other weapon.
Because the day we take
the path of violence
it'll be even easier to kill us.
Friends! A few young anarchists
in our own community
are spreading fake rumors
on WhatsApp and Facebook
in order to malign our unity.
We must be alert.
If anyone tries to raise their voice,
they're accused of being
a threat to national security
and killed.
The poet Paash once said:
""We all stand in danger
from this kind of threat.""
Pull over.
We are not the last ones.
Many will follow.
-Mahantji!
-Long live!
Long live Shanti Prasad!
-Mahantji!
-Long live!
I beg your forgiveness, Gaura.
I'll ask you again and again.
But don't forgive me.
If there's more violence,
they'll be the ones to pay for it.
Who is being violent, sir?
You must've heard their slogans.
Long live Bhim!
Sometimes the quiet persistent violence
behind such violence is overlooked.
It becomes part of our culture.
We don't call it violence then.
We call it law and order.
You can't be neutral, can you?
Staying neutral when a fire is raging,
is standing with the ones who lit it.
Who has lit the fire?
The man who's been calling you
repeatedly for the past 12 hours
he has lit the fire.
Your phone records.
Anything else to add?
Otherwise it's an open-and-shut case.
A clear-cut case of honor killing.
Sir, the three girls were only asking
for a three-rupee raise.
Three rupees.
Enough to buy you...
a couple of sips of mineral water.
That's all they wanted.
They were raped because
of this mistake.
They were not mature enough
for sex.
They were gang raped to remind them
of their place in society.
Their bodies could've been hidden.
Instead they were hung from a tree to
remind the scheduled caste of their place.
I've got the evidence, sir.
Their feet were tied with this rope.
They were gagged with this cloth.
The stained bed sheet found
at Anshu's school.
Anshu, Brahmadatt and Nihal
raped the girls.
Anyway, sir.
I'll submit the additional evidence
in due course.
In the near future,
I shall present all the hard evidence
in court, sir.
This case could've been dealt with
by my police station.
But no.
They said: ""This is what happens
with these people. This is just them.
""Don't touch the food they touch.
Don't let their shadows fall on you.""
In English,
they're called the scheduled caste,
scheduled tribes,
Other Backward Classes.
But in Hindi, their caste names
are used as swear words.
These castes, OBC, SC, ST represent
70% of our population, sir.
They've been marginalized and regarded
as minorities for eons, sir.
And we, the 30% of the population,
regard them as lesser in status.
We let them do
the jobs we don't want to do.
Nowadays our toilets have jet sprays.
But even now they still go down naked
into filthy sewers to clean them.
Unprotected and naked.
We know all this, we see it every day.
We just ignore it.
Sir, this is the ninety-pager.
My report.
I know you'll bin it.
I became a civil servant for my father.
You love Hindi so much.
I'm sure you love India very much.
But in all these years you haven't seen
what's happening. When in two days I have.
Or maybe ""these people"" do not exist
in your idea of India.
In Delhi, instead of saying
""Yes, sir"" every time
if you just once said ""No, sir.""
What's the worst that could happen?
You'd be done for, right?
That's already done.
You just don't know it.
Handle the case and the rioting.
I'm going to look for the missing girl.
She's waiting for us.
I hope you remember you're suspended.
No one remembers anything here.
Except for one's power.
I'll do whatever it takes to save Pooja.
If it's illegal, arrest me.
In life, there's a 50-50 probability
between yes or no.
And a positive outcome of 50% is a lot.
Long live India!
-Careful!
-Mind your step.
She's not in the fields, sir.
They're giving up the search
in the jungle.
You're entering the swamp, sir?
Someday even Brahmins have to descend
from on high.
Your clothes will get soiled, sir.
Has your mother any tips
on washing dirty clothes?
Not my mother, sir.
But the ads on TV say
stains are a good thing.
Let's go.
Careful!
She's not in the fields, sir.
They're giving up the search
in the jungle.
She must've crossed the swamp.
That's our only hope.
Let's search beyond the swamp.
We'll find her, Jatav.
-Chandrabhan.
-Yes, sir?
Aren't you a Rajput?
But I'm not brave like Rajputs.
I'm in the Ahir caste
because of my job, Yadav.
I have the same job as Lord Krishna.
Driving, I mean.
Who do you vote for?
The Bicycle Party?
No, sir. Before dying, mother said
always vote for the Flower Party.
-And you, Jatav?
-The Elephant Party, sir.
But once Flower and Elephant
joined hands.
-Then who did you vote for?
-The Bicycle Party.
Sometimes the Bicycle Party backs
someone from the scheduled caste.
And the Elephant Party backs Muslims.
-It gets so confusing, sir.
-So then?
We don't vote, sir.
I always vote for the Hand Party.
Madanlal wasn't
their candidate this year.
So I voted for the Candle Party.
Hi, Ayan. Shastri here.
Sir, I've been suspended,
in case you didn't know.
Just carry on.
Continuing, sir.
Are you deep in mud?
Many people are helping, sir.
Sir!
I've found the other slipper.
Pooja! We're here.
Pooja, the police are here!
It's the police, Pooja.
Pooja!
There's an old pump house ahead.
It's been shut for years.
-How far is it?
-A couple of kilometers.
Pooja!
It's me! Pooja.
Jatav, I want an ambulance here
in five minutes.
Following Pooja's statement
Brahmadatt was found guilty and
sentenced to 11 years imprisonment.
The court found the girls' fathers
had confessed under pressure.
They were exonerated
and released at once.
Mahant won the election hands down.
But for irreconcilable differences
over Ministerial berths
the Brahman-Dalit coalition
is in danger.
What have you cooked?
Bread and vegetables.
-Give it to everyone. We're starving.
-Yes.
Here you are.
-What caste are you, mother?
-I am...
My India is great

The story revolves around three characters — Ram Bharose, Sarabjeet, and Nimmi. Nimmi is the daughter of a bridal shop owner. Bharose works in a shop named 'Singh & Singh' and his friend Sarabjeet (aka Cyberjeet) dreams of creating another Facebook. A flashback to their school days reveals that Nimmi got pregnant by an acquaintance, and she ends up asking her close friend Bharose for help. Cyberjeet helps her by creating a fake school application for a sports tournament, which Nimmi uses as an excuse to go out of town for a night. Then Bharose poses as her husband and helps Nimmi get an abortion.

Time passes, and Bharose loses his job at Singh's shop due to a disagreement with him. During this time, Bharose's uncle has set up Bharose's marriage with his friend's daughter, Neha.

One evening Bharose and Cyberjeet are having tea at a stall where they witness a man being beaten up for eloping with his girlfriend. Upon witnessing this incident, Bharose and Cyberjeet brainstormed a website that will help needy couples to elope.

They successfully help 49 couples to elope and wait to help the 50th couple as their platinum achievement. Nimmi drops by and says that the doctor who had performed her abortion had visited her father's shop. Her father finds out about the abortion, and he decides to fix her marriage. She says that she needs Bharose's help in eloping with her friend Shunty, who had gotten her pregnant.

Bharose decides to help Nimmi and plans her escape even after repeated warnings from Cyberjeet. After everything goes according to plan, Nimmi informs Bharose that she planned to run away with Bharose and not Shunty. She admits to lying and blames Bharose for ignoring her repeatedly.

Bharose, now completely shocked, asks Nimmi to return home. She says that she has already written a letter addressing her parents, and they must be looking for her. They end up at Nimmi's aunt's house, but Nimmi's family finds her there and begins shooting at her. Nimmi gets hurt in this episode, and Bharose brings her to a hospital. After that, they travel to Dalhousie, but her family finds her when Nimmi posts her location online.

They plan to go to Patna, where Bharose's uncle lives. Bharose meets his to-be bride, Neha, in Patna. She reveals to him that she has a boyfriend and wishes to marryhim,m but her father is against their marriage. Bharose and team find an opportunity. They convince Neha and her boyfriend to comply with their plan to get hitched.

Finally, Neha's marriage day arrives. However, Neha's boyfriend and Cyberjeet end up at a police station. Nimmi tries to help Neha run away, but Neha's family finds her and brings her back to the mandap. Bharose goes to the bathroom and finds a man whom he had helped to elope. This man helps him with Neha's elopement.

In the end, Bharose gets tired of running along with Nimmi, and he decides to confront her family and get married with their consent.",2946,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt6296236.srt","Encoded by mAck | @ mAck Encodes |

<i>for every problem.</i>
<i>Coming to the problem... </i>
<i>The biggest problem</i>
<i>amongst youngsters these days</i>
<i>is getting married </i>
<i>according to their will.</i>
<i>But there's a quick-fix for that too.</i>
<i>A website... </i>
<i>and it's called Running Shaadi.</i>
{\an8}Love marriage only lasts
for a couple of months.
{\an8}Soon after they get fed up,
file for divorce.
{\an8}It's not advisable.
{\an8}It's spoiling the society.
{\an8}Parents always do the right thing.
{\an8}It's upsetting the apple cart.
{\an8}No, no. Running away
and getting married isn't right.
{\an8}<i>Why would anyone want</i>
<i>to run away and get married?</i>
{\an8}<i>Because their parents aren't allowing them</i>
{\an8}<i>or there are problems in the society,</i>
{\an8}<i>like caste and creed problems.</i>
{\an8}So I feel Running Shaadi is a good thing.
{\an8}At least they understand our problems.
{\an8}Parents will never agree.
{\an8}So, we'll have to run away
and get married.
If someone wants to run away,
they will run away.
So why not do it in a systematic way.
This is exactly why
Running Shaadi was created.
It's a great site.
I'll use it if I have to.
Have you lost your mind?
Don't you understand
what I am trying to say?
Don't worry about the price, madam.
We'll give you a good deal.
Just choose one.
Their entire wedding was ruined!
The driver didn't know the way.
Nimmi, come here.
What kind of skirt are you wearing?
Is this the way to go to school?
-Chotu.
-Yes.
Take her to the tailor
and ask him to stitch
a longer skirt for her.
Yes.
Uncle is in a really bad mood today.
He even gave a hard time to Tanny brother.
What's wrong with you?
That Jobanmeet Bajaj.
Did he tease you?
He proposed to me on Valentine's Day.
I went on a date with him.
I...
-I missed my period.
-Cover it up in the tuitions.
We had sex!
You're still too young to be doing that.
-But I--
-You're still in school!
Listen...
Listen, please...
If my father finds out,
I'll get in big trouble.
Please do something. Please.
What?
We're supposed to go play a match
on behalf of the school.
We leave in the morning
and come back the next day.
How many weeks has it been?
Ten.
I don't understand,
what do you boys have against condoms!
<i>There's something.</i>
<i>Because the winds have changed</i>
<i>There's something</i>
<i>Because I can feel a restlessness</i>
So Nimmi,
which course did you finally choose?
English Honors.
It's got the most amazing crowd.
<i>Life is smiling</i>
<i>The paths are tranquil</i>
<i>The dawn and dusk</i>
<i>Are meeting over the horizon</i>
<i>Something's definitely special</i>
Get down here. I'll go from here.
-I'll drop you.
-No, only students are allowed inside.
<i>Please stay, don't go</i>
<i>Don't let me spend my evenings alone</i>
<i>Please stay, don't go</i>
<i>Don't let me spend my evenings alone</i>
<i>What is life trying to convey?</i>
<i>These moments are going away</i>
<i>My desires are scattered</i>
<i>And I'm trying to count my blessings</i>
You're obsessed.
You keep calling me every minute.
When I call, you goddamned pick up.
What do you want from me?
-You want me to sit on your lap all day?
-I...
Don't I have friends, don't I have a life?
-I just want to know who I am.
-What?
-Exactly, who am I?
-What?
-Yes, what?
-Let me tell you what you are.
You're an illiterate idiot,
that's what you are.
I think we should remain just friends.
That we already are.
Fine, then let's stay that way.
Fine!
-Kartar.
-Yes, brother.
Did you deliver Mrs. Dhillon's order?
It's ready.
-Are you okay?
-Absolutely fine.
-It's my birthday tomorrow.
-I know.
Dad's throwing a party
at Kings Retreat tomorrow.
I know.
Are you coming?
Are you asking me or inviting me?
It's an invitation.
You must come. I'll be waiting for you.
-Chotu.
-Uncle.
Where were you?
There's so much to do.
Hey, mister, you wanted
sauce and ajinamoto, didn't you?
Chotu...
I don't know what I was thinking.
I forgot to pickup the cake.
Excuse me, we had ordered for a cake.
-Is this the one?
-Yes, that's the one.
The catering guys didn't arrange for ice.
Uncle's screwing me for the goof-up.
Nimmi.
Happy birthday.
-Finally, you found time to come.
-I... I...
Nimmi, come on, it's your birthday party.
What are you doing?
-Just a minute, I'll--
-Everyone's waiting.
What's wrong with you? Come on.
Yes?
-Greetings, uncle.
-What is the matter?
Remember that girl from
Patna you spoke to me about.
-If she's still interested...
<i>-Then?</i>
It's a yes from me.
I'm hanging up now,
talk to you later. Bye.
Why are you calling me?
You guys mess up everything
and I have to face the music!
Mrs. Dhillon's been calling me.
This is not my job, get it?
Do you know to do your job or not?
What the hell are you doing out there?
Stop arguing and hang up.
The embroidery is just pathetic.
Even the delivery isn't on time.
This isn't the first
time we got it done from you.
Your earlier work was impeccable.
What happened now?
It's such a shabby job!
This is not even wearable.
I'll call Ratni.
How much is it going to be?
You guys don't do your job
and I get blamed for it!
Call the guy and tell him
to take his stuff back.
-What is this?
-You tell me uncle what's going on here.
You appointed a stupid supervisor
for quality control.
And cheap workers at half the rate
are not doing their job.
The order was bound to get rejected.
How did the order get rejected?
Were you sleeping?
This is your responsibility.
What are you saying, uncle?
What responsibility?
Even you know that you do what you like.
What are you saying?
There's no planning at all.
No one knows what to do.
I wonder how you're still in business.
-Nothing is happening.
-What planning--
You couldn't even
organize a birthday party properly.
-Birthday party?
-Of course.
What about the birthday party?
-Why not?
-What was the problem in the party?
What was your plan?
You employed a stupid caterer
only to save a few bucks.
It was your daughter's birthday after all.
You could've celebrated grandly
by spending a bit more.
But you had to be such a miser.
Everything was fine. Everyone enjoyed.
You guys were enjoying,
because I was slogging
like a donkey until midnight.
Get it. It was 1:00 a.m.
I brought the slab of ice at 1:00 a.m.
while you were drunk and dancing.
If I don't enjoy, then who else will? You?
Just because I give you a little credit,
you think you're my boss now.
If I hadn't picked you up
from the streets,
then you would've been out slogging
driving a rickshaw.
Get back to your work.
I said go.
We'll discuss this at lunch-time,
there are customers now--
Shut up!
I said go.
If Singh 'N' Singh can do without me,
then even I can do
without Singh 'N' Singh.
Then do it.
After working hard for so long,
he says drive a rickshaw.
Did I come here to drive a rickshaw?
Whatever happened was for your own good.
What was good about it?
What could you have possibly
achieved in Singh 'N' Singh?
You think he would've
made you his son-in-law?
You were treating them more like family.
This is exactly why I asked
you to join me two years ago.
But you were so loyal to him.
""They're like family.""
Now you've to pay.
Try to understand, son.
It's a small city.
Everyone knows everyone here.
And if Ratni Uncle
isn't positive about you,
then no one will be willing
to support you in this market.
That's fine, uncle,
but why did you have to say all that?
You see son, that Sinha...
He was making such tall claims
about his daughter.
<i>And I didn't exactly lie to him.</i>
I just told him the truth.
After all, my nephew works
in Amritsar, Punjab.
So, what date did you fix?
The date is nine months later,
<i>-when she turns 18.</i>
-Eighteen?
There should be a decent gap in the age,
<i>for things to go smooth.</i>
You know what,
just add the girl on Facebook
and send her romantic messages.
-Understand?
-Okay, uncle.
This hand too...
Okay, I must take care of your cousin now.
He's messing things up.
I mean...
-You must show this--
-Show what?
-You couldn't shoot a small--
-Just one spoon at night,
and everything will be clear
in the morning.
All clear in the morning.
-Cut it!
-Constipation relieved. Stomach cleared!
Just one pill at night
and all clear in the morning.
Cut! Cut.
Very nice.
Hey, empty-hard disk.
Why is that guy
from Patna giving you his girl?
Don't they prefer IAS guys.
Now you're screwing with me too.
I am hungry, let's go eat.
There's a wedding, would you like to come?
-Whose?
-What do you care?
It's a non-veg party.
Free meal for us.
Isn't that guy from Patna
giving you a car or something?
I don't want anything.
What's your fetish with Russian salad?
I'll go get us a soft-drink.
So finally you got the time to call back.
I was a little busy?
Of course, I know where you've been busy.
You just got your wedding fixed.
Well, I can't be taking
your permission for everything.
Show me her picture?
I hope we're still friends.
If you ever need anything... call me.
Take care.
What?
Ran away!
How did she run away?
How did she run away?
I have invited over thousand guests.
And you're telling me she ran away.
Stop...
Stop the music!
Don't just stand there, go find her!
Go!
She shouldn't have run away so soon.
She did the right thing.
At least she had the courage
to keep her commitment.
Her guts made me miss my Russian salad.
Come on! Get down!
Who do you think you are?
Why are they bashing him up?
Wait...
How dare try to elope with the girl?
You don't need to get involved.
They were so close.
If only they had planned this out,
they could've run away and got married.
Well, the mind doesn't think
straight in such situations.
It's totally screwed.
How will they plan it out?
Well, see you in the morning.
Cyber... listen...
What was the name of that Windows guy?
Actually, he's still around. Bill Gates.
I have a really great idea, like he did.
Remember last night's incident?
If someone had provided a quick-fix
or planned for that boy and girl, then...
Then what?
They could've eloped successfully
and got married.
Meaning?
Meaning we provide a kind of a service
for those who want
to run away and get married.
Then all the problems will be solved.
Dot com!
Look, I have been thinking about
building a website like Facebook.
Let's combine both the ideas,
and make a website.
People make websites
for arranged marriage.
We'll make one for running marriages.
RunningShaadi.
Give me your card.
Card.
My card got stuck in the ATM last night.
Forget this ego.
Go and meet him once.
-What are you doing here?
-It's my father's shop.
But what are you doing here?
Trying to call Tanny,
but he isn't answering.
Papa sent him to Jalandhar for some work.
What is it?
I want to buy something from the internet,
I just needed his credit card.
-Buy from the internet?
-Yes, so?
-You?
-So?
I am sure you can.
After all, even you have
14 friends on Facebook now.
-Take my card.
-How can I take your card?
Do you want it or not?
What mess are you
two are getting into now?
What website is this?
-Mind your own business.
-Shut your mouth.
Will you be quiet?
Done?
-You should say thank you.
-Welcome not.
It's Bhangara-night (dance night) in my
college tonight.
Would you come?
What will I do there?
You'll be busy with your friends.
Fine. I'll go with Shunty instead.
He's been chasing me for a long time now.
Bye.
Dance nights with Shunty.
What do you care?
Make the website.
But first we must know
how will we help them elope?
I had to cancel my afternoon
date with Shunty for you.
Even we took a big risk
for you in the Jobanmeet case.
Shut your mouth
and mind your own business.
Control him.
Even if you don't take a bath,
-at least use a deodorant.
-She's right.
What's this now?
It's for our safety.
Aunt Neetu has seen me
many times at the shop.
What if she recognizes me?
Start.
Doesn't matter if it's 2013 or 2063,
parents never change.
Take Nimmi for instance.
Do you know her dad?
He's not going to ask
for her advice for her marriage.
Ratni's going to think
that he's the only smart guy around.
And that's why these lovers
run away and get married.
You know, Sweety and Ashu
from Sandhu colony,
their's was an internet case.
From chatting on Facebook,
we moved on to Skyping each other.
And without even a single meeting,
we knew we were made for each other.
-But our parents were old-fashioned.
-We were from different caste.
And so, we went to the Gurdwara in Ambala,
spoke with the priest and got married.
Later, the priest gave us a certificate
and we got the marriage registered.
So how did your family react to it?
Tell us...
How do you think
the family was going to react?
They sent Raje Mama after us.
The local gangster.
And he troubled us a lot. He was insane.
Chased us all over!
-Your sister-in-law is from Himachal.
-I see.
-Yes, yes.
-And I am from Punjab.
So that's an inter-state
and inter-caste problem.
But we booked our marriage
under the Special Marriage Act.
The lawyers do the maximum job.
If you can find decent lawyer,
he gets the job done for you.
Who's it going to be?
-How about him?
-He looks more like the bad guy.
Definitely not him.
Let's keep looking.
Is the guy local or NRI?
-He's local.
-And the girl?
You might say she's local too.
Well then, let's just say
she's local then.
You see, local's easier.
Lasts longer, you see.
Tell us the procedure.
Just get me the age proof
for the girl and boy.
Along with their photos and two witnesses
who should be their relatives as well.
That's all.
What if they don't have relatives?
No problem.
What are we here for?
We'll get the witnesses.
But... it will cost you extra.
Brother, what's the Special Marriage Act?
Special Marriage Act is an act
made by the Parliament of India,
according to which any girl of caste,
creed and color,
can marry any boy of any caste,
creed and color.
It is a very Orthodox
and ortho-modular law,
made by the parliament of India.
Sanctioned by Parliament of India.
I mean to say, for those special cases.
He looks greedy, he'll definitely say yes.
-Brother...
-Yes.
What's the matter?
That is a big matter,
it's a really big matter, brother.
Tell me something, brother.
How many cases do you get every day?
Summing up an average is difficult.
But I do see the judge twice a week.
What if we make you see him every day?
Every day?
You get an average of two to three cases.
How do you survive with that?
Who says it's enough to survive.
It's barely enough
to afford one square meal.
Exactly our point. We'll make sure that
you can't just afford full square meals,
but throw in a feast every day.
In fact, we'll make sure
sister-in-law enjoys it too.
Don't drag her into this! It's a very
touchy issue, I am warning you.
I won't do your job.
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
You just have to get us earlier dates
under the Special Marriage Act.
-And some priority.
-Yes.
Fine...
Deal... done!
Take their blessings first.
We're no less than Mark Zuckerburg
ourselves now.
What now?
Wait for people to upload their profile.
But how will the people
know about our site?
Hey, intelligent couples...
Whenever there's a sale at shop
Papa would go to that Popular Press guy,
for printing the pamphlets.
Yeah, I know.
I would take the design to him.
So do just that.
-She's right.
-I am always right by default, you fool.
Well, see you.
It's Shunty's birthday.
Best of luck for your ventures.
She's got only one thing on her mind.
""Shunty! Shunty! Shunty! Shunty!""
You've got work to do, don't you?
So stop doing Shunty!
Shunty! Shunty! Shunty!
Happy birthday to you.

{\an8}<i>When Shanty elopes with cute Minty</i>
-Password?
-MilkyShonku21.
-No, thanks.
-Get in.
Sit, sit.
Monkey caps?
Actually, our job is a little risky.
So this is for safety.
Intelligent, sir.
Cyber.
It's a Bengali and Punjabi case.
Thing is, when I was doing
my engineering from Delhi.
I met her for the first time.
And since then were together-together.
Great.
But now her family knows everything.
Her family has arranged her marriage
with a NRI person from Canada.
Tell me something,
what date is your wedding?
Tenth of next month.
By the way, madam, are you sure
that you want to marry him?
-I mean...
-What do you mean by this?
Shonku is the most brainiest person
I have ever known, okay.
-Stop racking your brain.
-Good mental, good mental.
-It's a good thing.
-Well, madam, tell me
why does your family have
a problem with such a brainy guy?
I don't know what allergy
does mom have against Bengalis.
But I have made it clear,
I am not going to marry any NRI.
-That was wrong.
-What?
Look, first go home,
and patch up with your family.
And assure them,
that you're ready to marry the NRI.
And then from tomorrow morning,
start jogging.
-Jogging?
-Yes, jogging.
From tomorrow, every morning
at 7:00 a.m. you must go jogging
in the park near your home.
Your parents will think that
you're trying to get healthy
for the wedding.
Preparing yourself.
They will relax.
And maintain this pattern
for the next couple of days.
And on the fourth day,
you'll see our red i10
parked next to the park.
Just go and sit quietly in the car.
<i>Run, Milky</i>
<i>Run, Milky</i>
<i>Run, Milky</i>
<i>Run, Milky</i>
<i>You're destined to be made for someone</i>

<i>You're destined to be sent off one day</i>

<i>Run, Milky</i>
<i>Run, Milky</i>
<i>Run, Milky</i>
<i>Run, Milky</i>
<i>Run, Milky</i>
{\an8}It's completely a filmy case.
Raj is Hindu and Shaziya is Muslim.
So it's the Special Marriage Act case.
My family is getting me
married forcefully.
Very big mess management package.
Believe that you're the real police.
Sit straight.
Bravo.
Now go.
Go on.
Straight
I'll slap you.
-Why is he sneaking in like a thief?
-Because he's stupid.
<i>All your troubles and love problems</i>
<i>All your troubles and love problems</i>
<i>Will be settled</i>
Have you seen a girl here, with a guy?
Cyber, get those two out from the back.
They seem like her brothers.
-Come on, come on.
-Hurry up.
Quickly, run. It's a bigger problem.
-Come on.
-Where are you taking them?
This is Hindu-Muslim problem.
It's a sensitive matter.
Do you have a place
to hide the boy and girl?
<i>When Dimpy runs away with Bunty</i>
<i>When Shunty elopes with Minty</i>
<i>When Dimpy runs away with Bunty</i>

-Bro...
-Yeah?
-Hear me out. I have a request.
-Go on.
I want a runaway wedding as well.
Your future sister-in-law's
children are such rascals.
They don't agree to our wedding.
But I want to marry her.
Actually, we can't live
without each other.
But our parents,
they just don't seem to agree.
Can you do something?
Well, love doesn't
distinguish between genders.
{\an8}It just happens.
{\an8}<i>Nothing to worry</i>
<i>The roads are ready</i>
{\an8}<i>And the cops have been dealt with</i>
You're still a minor.
You two want to get married, don't you?
Come back next year.
Now go.
{\an8}<i>One day there will be screaming</i>
<i>And shouting and full on worry</i>
{\an8}<i>People will brandish their swords</i>
<i>And fire in the air</i>
Shit!
Brother.
Brother? But who told them where we are.
There's no time to think about that.
We must first think about their safety.
Or else they will kill us.
Here's the marriage certificate.
This is the marriage certificate.
Show it to this gentlemen as well.
Take a look.
So legally they are husband and wife.
You guys must stop fighting now.
And if you resort to any kind of violence,
they've already been
given police protection.
I think it's better that you two parties
reach a compromise.
Great.
Come on, stand up and shake hands.
Bravo, bravo, come on.
Do it.
A round of applause everyone.
Have sweets. Eat it.
He who utters the name of Guru,
victory is his.
We've a new problem.
Some Simran, who wants
a musical nite before she runs away.
Stupid.
These things are very important for girls.
They are right to demand
for a Bollywood style musical nite.
What to do?
Stop staring at me.
<i>The biggest problem </i>
<i>amongst youngsters these days</i>
<i>is getting married</i>
<i>according to their will.</i>
<i>But there's a quick-fix for that too.</i>
A website, and it's called RunningShaadi.
<i>Welcome to our studio.</i>
-Hello.
-Hello.
My first question, why a website?
You see, we never think why,
we think why not.
Marriage is a huge business
in our country.
There's already a number
of matrimonial websites.
This could be the only
new variation in matrimony.
RunningShaadi.
The youngsters are very
happy with this website.
At least they understand our problems.
Parents will never agree.
So we'll have to run away and get married.
If someone wants to run away,
they will run away.
So why not do it in a systematic manner.
But elders, they are not very happy.
It's not advisable.
It's spoiling the society.
No, no, running away
and getting married isn't right.
Get me some water.
And some fritters.
Hello, sir.
-Password?
-Sukhi31.
Hello.
So it was you guys
who helped Jaspreet elope?
Jaspreet Dhillon?
Yes.
I guess she referred you to us.
She is my sister.
Lucky, come out, guys.
-Brother...
-Run.
Take off their caps.
Let's see who they are.
Police.
Little.
Little, wake up.
Wake up.
What happened?
-There's a big problem.
-What happened?
Remember that lady doctor
from the Jobanmeet matter?
<i>The stupid wretch came to my shop.</i>
<i>Madam, she's my daughter.</i>
<i>-Your daughter?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>She told dad everything.</i>
<i>My dad lost his mind.</i>
<i>There's some Gurwinder Bhatti</i>
<i>and he's fixed my marriage with him.</i>
I don't want to marry him.
What do you want to do?
-Love marriage?
-With whom?
With you.
Stop joking with me in the morning.
Yes, I was joking.
Who's going to marry you, stupid?
Have you seen your face?
I want to marry Shunty.
-Shunty?
-Yes.
You two have come this far,
you didn't tell me.
You want me to take your
permission for everything.
It's not about permission.
Your love's always too instant.
I can see that
Jobanmeet matter repeating again.
Stop lecturing me now.
Then why did you come here?
To invite me to your wedding?
Shunty is Tejpal uncle's son.
Great. Then uncle will
definitely get you two married.
How intelligent! That's exactly
why I came asking for your help.
-What can I do?
-RunningShaadi.
Help me run away.
Are you crazy? What can I do?
Stop behaving like that.
Didn't I help you out?
Try to understand, I can't do this.
Uncle will think I am just taking revenge.
And your brother, he's my friend.
Don't get me
involved in this mess, get it?
I don't get all this.
You're worried about uncle and my brother.
And I am trouble?
Great.
Nimmi, try to understand.
I understand.
Fine.
-Listen...
-What?
Even you ended up using me.
Fine, I understand. It's okay.
I'll handle it.
But, yes. Do me a favor.
Don't tell Tanny anything.
Can you do that much?
Thank you.
<i>That girl is like a virus in your life.</i>
<i>Don't be a fool.</i>
Don't let this fan the fire
between Uncle and you.
And isn't Tanny your friend?
You want to help her sister elope?
You're a weird guy.
And what about your own wedding?
You're supposed to leave
for Patna in two weeks.
Don't get in to this mess.
Dad misses you too.
You should meet him once before you go.
It'll be the right thing to do.
Tell me more.
How can you think like that, Nimmi?
Just quietly marry whoever
your father wants you to.
You'll automatically fall in love.
Stop lecturing me on love.
You said yes to that Bihari girl
out of desperation.
And now you're advising me.
I wasn't desperate.
I just didn't see a future with you,
so I quietly moved on.
Fine, so let me move on too.
I asked for a small favor,
and you couldn't do that either.
-Tanny is like a brother.
-Am I your enemy?
No attachment with me?
That's exactly why
I am trying to explain you.
You just recently met that guy.
Get to know him first.
-You're being hasty.
-How can you say I don't know Shunty?
You want to know?
-Have you met him?
-I don't want to meet him,
-you're the one getting married.
-But you're going to help me elope.
Let's meet him. Meet him once.
Now you're forcing me.
-Come on.
-But--
Let's go meet him.
He's here.
Hi, baby.
Hi. Myself Daljeet Kapoor,
also known as Shunty.
I have told him everything about you.
Don't let us down.
We want to elope day after tomorrow.
But where will you go?
We'll settle down in Delhi.
He's already got a job in an MNC.
And tomorrow is his induction.
He's an MBA.
Fine, I...
-I'll do something.
-Thanks.
Really appreciate it.
Don't worry, everything will be fine.
Sure?
Thank you.
Didn't I tell you he'll help us?
Even I am marrying someone else, right?
So even she has a right,
to move on in life.
Right.
Martyred lovers look good only in cinema,
in real life they are called assholes.
Fine, then I am an asshole.
-Asshole.
-I am a big asshole. Now what?
You're a bigger asshole.
Hey, asshole.
So, when does she want to elope?
Speak up.
Leave for Ambala tomorrow.
Why Ambala?
It's just too risky out here.
There's a court right next
to the Gurdrawa.
We'll get their marriage registered there.
Shunty has some introduction in Delhi,
he'll come directly.
And your virus Nimmi...
I am sure her father
is keeping a strict watch on her.
How do we get her out?
Hey...
Where?
Hen-party.
What's a hen-party?
Just like boys have a bachelor party
before their wedding.
This one's for the girls.
-Like a bachelors party.
-We don't want any party.
Please, uncle.
-Please, uncle.
-She will go to Ludhiana.
Please, uncle, we won't get
another chance.
If you want to party, then do it here.
No, no, no, uncle, it's not that.
It's a girls party, just us only.
Please, uncle, please, let us go.
-Tanny.
-Yeah?
Go with them.
Tanny? Uncle, what will he do with us?
It's a girls party, yeah, please.
No Tanny, no party.
-Fine.
-Come, Tanny.
Am I going to sit on your lap?
Tanny, let it be.
What will you do amongst girls?
Pick me up in the morning
from Arshi's home.
Papa asked me to keep a watch on you.
You don't trust me either.
Isn't that it?
Great.
Papa will screw me over,
try to understand.
I only have two days,
after that I'll go away.
Let me have some fun.
Please, brother. Can't you
do this much for your sister?
I'll pick you up at 7:00 a.m.
Fine.
-Go.
-Thank you.
Go carefully.
Bye.
Bye.
Be careful.
Thanks, thanks.
And, call me as soon as you get there.
Couldn't you park a little further?
But I told you,
I'll be sitting in a red i10 car
outside Avtaar Singh's flourmill.
They all look the same to me in the dark.
-What if someone had seen me?
-But no one did.
Are you waiting for someone
to see me? Let's go.
{\an8}You're with RunningShaadi,
{\an8}I am eloping you.
{\an8}-We are fool-proof.
-Shut up and drive.
Let's get a beer
on the way, stress-buster.
Are you crazy?
We're gonna drink a beer now?
Only crazy people drink beer?
Weird.
Did you run away to get married
or to have fun?
It's not every day
that I run away from home.
Let's enjoy all the way.
-Well, consider it a party from me.
-Great.
We'll reach drunk at the venue
and scare your groom away.
Shunty isn't like you, he's broadminded.
Fine, I am taking you to him.
Did you wash your hands?
Always wash your hands
after peeing, Little.
Learn some good manners.
Rascal.
What are you doing, Ratni?
Slapping your son.
I asked him to keep a watch on her.
How did she run away?
Nothing, the client's demand
is to eat first.
And we cannot refuse the client.
It's the consequence
of taking up a glutton like her.
Stop blabbering.
<i>-Is everything set out there?</i>
-Yeah.
Everything's set here,
but your brother-in-love Shunty's phone
is switched off.
He'll get there directly. Keep trying.
<i>And stop stuffing your face </i>
<i>with those fritters.</i>
-How did you know?
-Hang up.
Nimmi, Shunty isn't answering his phone.
He's got his Accounts exam today.
What kind of exam after a job?
Shunty is my senior in college.
And he put up this charade for me.
Meaning?
Meaning, I wanted to elope
with you, stupid.
You're joking, right?
Fine, I admit my mistake.
I got too carried away
by my college friends.
You were right.
But you know how they are?
-Are you mad?
-You lost your mind.
And you fixed your marriage
with that Bihari girl.
As a result, even I made up
a fake story about Shunty.
I thought I'll make you jealous.
I'll go with Shunty.
I had to cancel my date with Shunty.
It's Shunty's birthday.
Tell me something, you think I am crazy
to be running around with cards
and pamphlets of your Running Shaadi.
Don't I have better things to do?
I thought I'll spend some time with you.
Maybe you'll learn some sense
and cancel your wedding.
But you turned out to be
more stubborn than me.
Well, if I didn't have big ego,
I would've apologized myself.
Then why didn't you?
Why put up this charade?
I did.
-Love marriage.
-With whom?
You.
Did you see your reaction?
See your face?
It was a complete turn off.
And I made up that Shunty story.
You've lost your mind?
Why are you being so emotional? Chill.
The plan still remains the same.
We'll go to the Gurdwara and get married.
And then the registry.
All set. Don't worry.
Great, all set.
What a great plan you made.
How will I face uncle?
What about uncle?
He must know by now.
I left a letter before running away.
I wrote ""I am running away
with Bharose and getting married.""
Look, Little, I cannot go back now.
Father is so dumb.
Why will I answer his calls now?
And you're so smart, aren't you?
You couldn't think of a better idea.
I don't understand why
you're getting so emotional.
You should be happy.
I went through so much trouble for you.
Actually, it's bigger than you think.
And the timing is even worse.
It's a feeling.
It doesn't give you a
warning before it comes.
Yeah, great. Only you have
all the feelings, don't you?
Are you even aware of the consequences?
Where are you? I don't care.
Sit at the airport and check
who's coming and going.
The actual root of this mess is Youtube.
Great, man.
Uncle will have to change
the name of his shop,
from Singh 'N' Singh to Singh 'N' Bharose.
Let it be. That's never going to happen.
Your friend is a sissy.
If only my father
was the programmer at ETC Punjabi,
he would've definitely married me.
What's ETC got to do with this?
Shut up!
-You don't get it, do you?
-No, I don't.
I wasn't ready for such a big mess.
I have a commitment in Patna,
you know that.
Fine, go.
Go marry that illiterate Bihari.
She's fit for you.
-Fine.
-Great.
-Fine, go then. Go!
-Fine.
Relax, lovers.
Tell me clearly, do you
guys want to get married or not?
The priests are waiting.
No one's getting married.
Call your home now
and tell them everything you did.
Shut your mouth, you fool,
and lower your voice!
I am not calling anyone.
-Hello.
-Hello, mom.
What's all this charade, dear?
-Where are you?
-What difference does it make?
Let's not get into details.
I am coming back.
<i>No, no, no, don't come back right now.</i>
Papa and Tanny are in an awful mood.
<i>I suggest that you two go </i>
<i>to Aunt Neetu's airport manor.</i>
Stay there tonight.
I will try to convince your father.
I'll wait outside.
Nimmi...
Nimmi, I...
Best of luck for your commitment, Bharose.
Me?
-Where will you go now?
-Home!
Are you crazy?
If anyone spots you in the city,
they will beat you to a pulp.
-You two stay here tonight.
-It's all right, we'll manage.
Hey, management, you've nothing to lose,
but he'll get into deep shit.
Stay here tonight.
-Think of something in the morning.
-I'll tell him.
Let's stay. It's safe here today.
We'll think of something tomorrow morning.
Nimmi, are you okay?
Thank God.
How are you, son?
Come, come in.
Give me the car keys.
I left my moisturizer inside.
Like I said, she's the virus in your life.
I am leaving here.
What more can I do?
Fine.
Happy, look.
Run, Bharose, run.
-Nimmi, give me the key.
-What?
Catch him.
Come on, hurry!
Keep looking.
There...
Come on, let's go.
Look behind.
I think we left them behind.
-I think we're safe.
-What safe?
I told Nimmi this plan won't work.
Shit!
I told you don't be a stupid lover.
We're in big trouble now.
Nimmi, come out.
You'll get me killed too.
She's been shot!
Nimmi. Nimmi.
Shit! Get in the car.
Get in the car, quick.
Go, go, get the doctor!
Was it one of those Haryana Roadways bus?
-Yes.
-They drive pretty rashly.
Is it serious?
Some glass pieces
were lodged in the shoulder.
She bled a lot, so she will have
fever for few days.
How many bullets?
Sorry, man.
I was worried.
Try to keep calm.
Yes. The differential's
been damaged as well.
Nothing serious.
Tanny.
Inspector.
Shit, I wonder why they
had to involve the local goon.
Let's get out of here.
This way, come on.
Mister.
Nimmi, eat something.
You've to take your medicines.
There's a bus that leaves
for Dalhousie in ten minutes.
What to do?
<i>I want to run away with you</i>
<i>I want you to always be in my destiny</i>
<i>The hearts set out on the path of love</i>
<i>O Sun, illuminate my path</i>
<i>I will patch these bonds</i>
<i>That are separate</i>
<i>You will find me always</i>
<i>Standing behind you</i>
<i>If you feel cold</i>
<i>I'll shield you with my warmth</i>
<i>I feel lost along with you</i>
<i>I want you to always be in my destiny</i>
<i>What dwells in my soul is your love</i>
<i>Like the sun</i>
<i>Sailing in a boat over the river</i>
<i>Don't waste your luminance</i>
<i>Your sorrows are a burden to me</i>
<i>My heart wants to keep beating for you</i>
<i>I want to run away along with you</i>
<i>I want you to always be in my destiny</i>
<i>The hearts set out on the path of love</i>
<i>O Sun, illuminate my path</i>
<i>The fire that burns in our bodies</i>
<i>Is also fragrant like love</i>
<i>My tresses are drenched</i>
<i>And the drops are like fire</i>
<i>I can spend a lifetime like this</i>
<i>With you, I feel complete</i>
<i>Even the dust in my hands</i>
<i>Turned to vermillion</i>
<i>I want to run away along with you</i>
<i>I want you to always be in my destiny</i>
<i>The hearts set out on the path of love</i>
<i>O Sun, illuminate my path</i>
<i>I will patch the bonds that have withered</i>
Where are your manners?
Sorry for disturbing your activities.
But I just saw Raje mama
and his gang in the market.
He was showing your photos
in every shop and inquiring.
Sorry, man.
I...
I uploaded pictures
of Dalhousie on Facebook.
Sorry.
Now, we'll have to run from here too.
How long will I keep
running with my Nimmi?
My Nimmi.
Rascal, you're marrying one
and running away with another.
What do you want?
Right now, I want everyone's safety.
We can get safety in Laloo's country.
-Patna?
-Yeah.
It's a stupid idea.
You know his wedding's been fixed.
But that's his area.
No one can touch him out there.
That's a fact.
And will you take me there
as your wedding guest?
Nimmi...
I... I'll think of something.
Stop, stop, stop here.
Uncle.
Bharose.
-How are you?
-Just fine.
You were supposed to come after a week.
You could've at least informed me.
Doesn't matter.
Mukundi would've
picked you from the station.
Well, I wrapped up work soon,
so I came early.
Nimmi. Cyber. She's Cyber's sister.
-Brother and sister?
-Yes.
Very nice.
-I am heading to the studio?
-Are you shooting something?
I am making an ad for phenyl.
Cockroach Clean Phenyl.
Fine, uncle, you leave, we'll take a nap.
See you in the evening.
Why evening?
Come in the afternoon,
we'll have lunch together.
-Fine, then I'll freshen up.
-Take a bath?
No, no, no, it's okay.
Of course we will, we'll take a bath.
It was a long journey, we'll take a bath.
Isn't there any water?
Of course there's water.
The geyser's working too.
But it blows up after 10-12 minutes.
Fill up a bucket and use that for bathing.
Uncle, you're just...
I am waiting there, okay?
Nice.
Get some rest, enjoy.
Should I give it a push?
-Push?
-Yes.
You're still hogging this piece of junk.
Why don't you buy a new one?
I will, this is just for now.
I just fueled her up.
It's runs really smooth.
Just watch it sail smoothly.
Yes... yes... yes...
Bravo...
Bharose... thank you.
Ujala Babu.
Ujala Babu.
Who could that be at this early hour?
It's so dark in Ujala Babu's house.
Ujala Babu.
Ujala Babu.
Ujala Babu.
Ujala Babu.
Brother-in-law.
Oh, my God. I can't believe.
Brother-in-law, when did you arrive?
You were supposed to come after four days.
-Well, work finished early, so...
-But, this is not done.
We would've come to pick you up,
with special arrangements.
Sit, sit. Calm down.
-How about some water?
-This is bad.
You should've informed me before.
-Water?
-Yes, yes, water. Give me some water.
I can't believe it.
Nimmi, stay inside.
-Water?
-Yes.
Who is the lady?
She's my friend's sister,
here to attend my wedding.
-Any problem?
-No, no.
-Any objection?
-No.
My friends can attend my wedding,
can't they?
What's to object?
I'm just see a new face,
that's why I am telling you. No big deal.
I came to tell you, that the DJ...
-Mithilesh?
-Yeah, Mithilesh...
He's just awesome.
When he plays his music,
even the dead start dancing.
-That's how good he is.
-Is he?
Yeah.
I'll get you something to eat, wait.
I won't eat.
I want you, your family.
along with your friends
to come over for a meal.
Why friends? It's a family matter.
We'll come.
Your friends will come,
we'll get to know each other.
We'll maintain a relation with her.
If uncle finds out,
he'll say why I didn't invite them too.
-Okay?
-Okay, I get it.
-I'll get them too.
-You get it.
Can I leave now?
-With your permission?
-Of course.
Okay. I am so happy to see you.
Great.
Do come.
-Okay.
-See you.
Savita, when I say action
pour a capful in the bucket.
This phenyl company,
hasn't paid me
for my last four ad campaigns.
His phenyl isn't selling
and he blames my ads for it.
But that's not my fault.
Back home you would
drink even ground water
and out here you want mineral water.
Go sit in the cow-shed.
What's your scene with that girl?
-What girl?
-That girl who came here with you.
-Nothing.
-Did you two do it already?
-What are you saying, uncle? Why would--
-No, even if you did, just leave her.
I don't know you.
Mistakes happen.
Soon you'll get married, son. Right?
Take care.
Uncle...
I have submitted a pilot episode
in DD Patna.
Now it's in Sinha sir's hands.
But you're in my hand, aren't you?
Your aunt has made
a heavy investment for the Pilot.
Look at that, you're piling on weight.
You won't be able to work properly.
Look at your aunt.
How she's cutting corners
on the Unit member's lunch.
You two are brothers, right.
Eat together, come on.
Uncle... I...
-I have a doubt about Neha.
-What?
What doubt?
She is a very beautiful, gentle lady.
I knew it right away,
that she is made for you.
Only.
Think only about Neha,
otherwise the entire family
will be out on the street.
I beg you.
How are you?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Swine.
Never pays on time.
Just act smart.
See the guy in the black coat?
I am sure he alone drinks up
all of the phenyl.
Nothing must be left for the company.
I'll go meet the swine.
Yes, I'm coming.
You wait here till then, I'll be back.
Have your tea.
Yeah, sir, I am waiting for you.
You're looking a little weak.
You didn't tell your uncle, yet.
Speak softly, he'll hear you.
It's a very complicated matter.
Muktiyar, this will go in
""the Very Big Mess"" package.
Are you taking me along
to be a part of your happiness?
Try to understand.
If you don't come, they will
ask me couple of more questions.
Let's go, please.
Tell you what, you pay for everything now.
We'll settle the accounts
when we get back.
Do what you want?
Just don't go get married to that girl.
Next, you'll see me
dancing in your wedding.
Is she coming along... that girl,
Nimmi and that boy, her brother?
Why are you so interested?
I am not.
The more the people,
the better the impression.
Let's cheers. Come on.
Now that way, this way.
You're gonna bump someone.
I am driving an ambassador,
it's not a joke.
Left...
-Two-two-two-two...
-What's two-two-two-two.
If you would have played
you would have lost two kilos.
Turn this way, this way.
I have had enough of you.
Why should I turn that way?
I'll follow the road.
You guys should stand aside.
You see, he's not too good
with the steering.
-Is he driving himself?
-He's already been in three accidents.
He broke the Doordarshan wall.
Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.
Bantu... Bantu, put a brick under the car.
-Prakash, you're so naughty.
-Come, come.
I am naughty.
Put a brick under it.
-How are you?
-Great.
Just great.
Come, welcome.
Come in.
Hello, Nimmi.
Come in, please.
Nimmi, help yourself with the sweets.
Nimmi, it's special sweet, please.
Slowly.
Now that's called love.
He's my nephew,
but I have always treated him like a son.
After all, he's my sister's son.
Great.
Well, I think the boy
and girl should meet now.
Dear, if she's finished decking up,
then call her out.
-Look, here she is.
-There she is.
-She's here.
-Very nice.
Seems like an angel
descending from heaven.
Take blessings, dear. Go on.
-Take your shoes off.
-It's all right.
-Bless you, dear.
-Take your shoes off.
-Bless her properly.
-It's done.
We're modern people,
we don't believe in these things.
They are modern too.
Let Neha sit there.
Sitting there like an ox.
-Whose son is that?
-I told you, he's...
-It's their family matter.
-There's a history behind it.
I'll tell you some other time.
You're being shy, how does she look?
It's their first marriage, after all.
Just beautiful. Who chose her after all?
She's my choice.
-And Neha sings so well.
-Yeah.
She sings almost like a nightingale.
Come on, sing a song.
What would you prefer?
-Classical, folk, western--
-Modern.
-Sing a modern song, dear.
-Yes.
Dear, sing a modern song for them.
Artists always need freedom.
Artists always need freedom.
Go ahead, sing.
Sing.
I'll play and you sing.
Come on, start.
<i>One-two-three-four</i>

<i>Bum-shake... Bum-shake</i>
<i>Gilli-gilli-gilli-gilli dumbo</i>
Clap.
Great, wonderful.
-So, she's done?
-Yeah.
Let Neha and Bharose
get to know each other.
Let them talk.
Just talk.
Go on, go on...
There's a big garden up ahead.
Just go take a look.
Go on, son.
He's a bit shy.
Go, talk openly about everything.
Tell him about your education too.
-Send two cups of tea for the children.
-Yes.
<i>One-two-three-four</i>
<i>Get on the dance floor</i>
<i>Bum-shake... Bum-shake</i>
Neha's so talented, isn't she?
I am really confused.
Is she better or her?
Even I am confused,
should I slap you, or give you a whack?
You're jealous, that's all.
I am not jealous at all.
You guys don't know anything.
Did you see her face?
She was sad.
She's right, something's wrong.
That Sinha looks over-exited
and his daughter doesn't even talk to me.
See.
Let's investigate this case.
Let's find out everything,
like where she goes,
when and who she goes out with.

She needs it.
How about a cup of tea? Come.
At least her brothers

-They are bored too.

Why are you so late?
My UPSC coaching.
It's a guy.
More hidden qualities of your Neha Sharma.
Please try...
Look, your wife's kissing him.
No, Cyber, this is something serious.
No wonder Sinha's getting
his daughter married to me,
as soon as she turns 18.
Stop!
Rascal, where do you think you're going?
Where are you going?
Look, my father is just
a fourth grade government officer.
You won't get any ransom, please...
Do you love Neha Sinha?
-Neha? Neha who?
-Neha who?
Rascal...
-My future wife.
-Wait!
Wait, don't scare him.
Don't scare him.
Do you love her or not? Tell me.
-I do, a little.
-What? Little...
-No, no!
-Little...
You love her a little?
I love her a lot.
That's exactly why
I went to see her one last time.
-Will you marry her?
-How can I marry your future wife?
We're not asking, we're telling you.
You're going to marry her.
Don't worry, come on.
Don't worry, I said I won't hit you. Come.
What's your name? Tell me your name?
You're sweating. Wipe your sweat.
-Amit Kumar.
-Look, Amit Kumar.
She's a nice girl, marry her.
-That's fine, but, Neha's father...
-Yeah?
That old man has taken her phone,
internet connection, Twitter, everything.
How will I get there?
Don't worry, I am there.
I'll arrange everything.
Are you crazy?
Why take the risk of eloping her
from her wedding?
Let's do it before that.
You don't get it, don't you?
If the wedding procession doesn't
get there, uncle will be ruined.
His serial will be scrapped.
Why are you so concerned
about your uncle's serial?
What about our life that's
turned into a daily soap?
When I was a kid, I had no parents,
uncle was everything for me.
He always stood behind me.
And now that he needs me,
I must stand with him.
I will have to help him.
I can't just leave him alone.
And Neha...
Nimmi, we'll need your help. Understood?
<i>Go to Neha Sinha's home tomorrow morning.</i>
<i>It's her 18th birthday.</i>
<i>Go meet her under the pretext </i>
<i>of wishing her</i>
<i>and show her Amit Kumar's video.</i>
<i>Convince her that sissy</i>
<i>is ready to marry her.</i>
<i>Okay?</i>
<i>And at any cost...</i>
<i>And at any cost,</i>
<i>convince her for our plan.</i>
When the wedding procession leave,
you and Amit Kumar will disappear.
You two must get there
before we do with the guests.
<i>Neha Sinha will be waiting for you in </i>
<i>one of the rooms in Pataliputra Heritage.</i>
<i>Pick her up from there.</i>
<i>I'll hire a white ambassador</i>
<i>and tell him to park downstairs.</i>
Take the taxi to Bodh Gaya,
<i>where Dadua will get you</i>
<i>two married and get it registered.</i>
And when we arrive with the guests,
things would've already gone awry.
After Neha Sinha disappears,
Sinha will be embarrassed.
Okay? He'll quietly approve the serial.
Uncle will be happy too,
everything will be fine.
And anyway,
it's only for a couple of months.
Sinha and Family
will finally accept Amit Kumar.
-Just like Milky-Shonku case.
-Wow, Little, proud of you.
What a plan.
Here... have a peanut.
-Mithilesh?
-Yes.
Uncle, I have finished
all the arrangements.
-Everything is okay.
-Okay.
It's going to play,
it will blow everyone out.
Look here, I have finished
all the lighting as well.
Take a look, see, it looks so beautiful.
What happened?
No connection.
So after all you made me
a guest in your wedding.
-Shall we?
-Come.
Let's deal with this.
<i>I am your better and you're my best</i>
<i>You're my bird and I am your nest</i>
<i>So why do you keep taking my love's test?</i>
<i>I don't keep taking your love's test</i>
<i>Get it</i>
See...
RunningShaadi's made such
a grand arrangement for your wedding.
Get in the feeling.
<i>You're my east, you're my west</i>
<i>You're my prayer and you're my request</i>
<i>You're my ludo, I am your chess</i>
<i>You look like new and I'm so fresh</i>
<i>So why do you keep taking my love's test?</i>
<i>I don't keep taking your love's test</i>
Nimmi!
Something's not right, Little.
Yeah, even I don't understand
what's going on here.
Everyone looks happy.
You know what, go inside
and check whether Neha ran away or not.
Go. Call Cyber.
-Call Cyber.
-Yes.
Quickly. go on.
I wonder what happened?
Uncle? Uncle? Uncle?
Uncle?
Uncle, why's everyone so excited?
Is everything all right?
It's their daughter's wedding, after all.
-They are bound to be excited.
-Right.
Mr. Sinha is giving 5,100 and a really
cozy blanket as a welcome gift.
Unbelievable!
Seems like uncle just robbed an ATM.
Yeah. But only 20 rupee notes.
Garland, garland.
-Ujala.
-Two hearts uniting.
Uncle, you too.
Take this garland.
-Blanket, give me the blanket.
-Blanket.
Here's the blanket.
-Why spend so much?
-It's done now.
Come, come, come, sit.
A bit more ahead.
Photographer?
We've paid him in full.
Look here.
Look here, look here.
You too, come.
Let the children sit closer.
Look here, children.
-Smile.
-What's going on?
Thank you.
Nimmi, what happened?
Neha is still in her room,
she didn't run away.
-What?
-What now?
Did you talk to Cyberjeet?
Some girl keeps calling
continuously on your number.
One of my constables was doing his duty,
but he bribed him with
50 rupees and said share it.
Firstly, he was driving that
antique piece, without any papers
or driving license either.
And then bribery.
I had to push that heap of junk
all the way to the station.
-Well, what's plan B?
-Nimmi, plan A never failed.
So we never had plan B.
Do this, go tell your uncle everything.
And tell him to forget
all about his TV serial.
What are you saying, Nimmi?
How can I do such a thing?
My uncle and his company will be ruined.
You'll have to do something, Nimmi.
You're stepping into your new life now.
-Life isn't easy after...
-Neha!
-What have you done to her?
-What happened?
What happened, madam?
-Are you the beautician?
-Yes, I am.
What kind of makeup is this?
-What is this hairstyle?
-It's fine.
-Is this how she's going to get married?
-I chose this hairstyle from a magazine.
It's really awful.
Sister, I have been trying
to tell her since morning,
that it's an awful hairstyle,
but she doesn't listen.
She just finished doing your makeup.
-How can you tell her since morning?
-Brother,
please don't interfere in female matters.
-Listen to me--
-Nimmi, listen to me.
Everyone's waiting out there,
we're losing precious time.
Her photo and video,
everything will be ruined.
I'll fix it.
-I'll be back soon, don't worry. Okay.
-Oh, God--
-Please go, please.
-Listen--
-Go.
-Stop pushing--
It's her wedding,
what have you done to her?
-I kept telling her that, but--
-We don't have time.
You did what you had to do.
But everyone's waiting.
Stay here, I'll be right back.
Everyone's waiting.
Unbelievable.
Sister...
Tell me something,
why did they shift you to the third floor?
There was some
electricity problem out there.
Sister, think of something.
-How do I get you out of here?
-Think, think, think...
It took me four hours to do her makeup.
I know you did, you're an artist.
I can see that in your eyes.
Are you thinking of something?
Come here. Climb up.
Look... walk on these bricks, till there.
Then jump down from there.
I'll bring a ladder
and help you climb down.
What if I fall down?
You will only break your back.
But if you get married to Bharose?
-Eat some...
-No, no...
-Come on, you'll feel better.
-I don't want to eat.
I apologise on her behalf.
-You know what, just do as I say.
-Yes.
-Go get some sweets.
-Yes.
-And ice-cream.
-Yes.
-Keep the tools down. Keep it.
-Now go, and hurry up.
Sister, I am scared.
-Come on, one, two, three.
-No, hail Goddess.
Fine, that too.
Quickly.
Don't waste time, or I'll push you.
Wait, wait, wait, sister.
-Hail Goddess.
-Yes.
Fine, I am doing it.
Careful, see you downstairs.
Here, eat it.
Eat... please.
See...
-Are you guys done?
-What done?
I mean, If you guys are done setting,
let her hair set in.
Don't disturb her for 10-15 minutes.
Why won't we, why not disturb...
Don't disturb her.
You act like you're the queen
or something.
You play with someone's sentiments.
Just too much.
-Let it be, let it be.
-I...
She will make her look like a movie-star,
I would like to watch too.
Hail Goddess!
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!
Save me! Save me!
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!
Hail Goddess!
-Where's the back gate?
-There?
Thank you.
Hey, is your name Ramkhilavan?
Why are you sleeping? Get up!
Didn't I tell you?
She's looking really beautiful.
Priest...
I must go to the bathroom.
Of course, you can go,
but after completing the nuptial rounds.
But I must go now.
Hold it for a minute, it's almost done.
Breathe easy.
Concentrate on your belly button.
Hello...
-He's busy on the phone, I must go...
-You can't get up like this.
He's busy on the phone, see.
I'll throw that phone in the fire.
Nonsense.
Listen, brother-in-law.
Bloody Cyber. Why isn't he answering
the phone? Bloody fool.
Get done with it...
What the...
What can I do if he has to pee?
It's almost time.
Now start...
Come on, you're delaying everything.
What are you two whispering?
-What happened?
-What happened to the light?
Curse you.
Must be a blown fuse.
No electricity.
What kind of arrangement is this?
Find out.
Where's the generator guy?
What insolence is this?
What arrangement is this?
Calm down, please.
Buntu, go check.
Sinha sir...
you knew your daughter had an affair,
yet, you were so hasty
in getting her married to my son.
What are you saying, Ujala?
Youngsters always do such thing
before marriage--
What nonsense!
The last time I felt this bad was
when Laloo sir was jailed.
No need to worry. Prasad, what happened?
I spoke with them, we'll know really soon.
I spoke with the CA... the PA...
-Yes, we'll know in ten minutes.
-Ten minutes.
Not a single train will leave
Patna station without my permission.
-Listen--
-Brother-in-law!
-Listen, don't call me brother-in-law.
-Please...
-Your daughter ran away.
-Yes.
-Get it.
-Uncle, let me make it clear.
I won't marry a runaway bride.
It's a matter of my reputation.
Listen, do one thing, return his serial.
We don't want any kind
of relation with such people.
How can we return the contract?
We don't want your favor.
-What favor? I trust Shanti Productions.
-Yes.
Why drag the serial in all this?
And anyway I already signed
the contract in the morning.
It's already been passed.
Look, it's our mistake,
my daughter ran away.
Forgive us.
Look, son.
He's the girl's father after all
and he's trying to atone.
Get it.
Sit down everyone...
and tell the MLA to stay in ICU.
-Yes, of course.
-Yes.
Tell him, tell him.
Now get some rest,
and get some tea for my son.
Get some tea... some ginger tea...
-Cardamom too.
-Cardamom tea.
I have a headache from wearing
that headgear for so long.
-It's possible.
-Massage his head.
Get some tea, spiced tea.
Cyberjeet Singh.
First time in the history
of RunningShaadi you failed me.
All because you tried
to be over smart with a cop.
He showed you, didn't he?
Thank God I ran into Shonku.
Brother, glad to meet you.
So the guy,
getting married outside, is you.
Forget it.
What are you doing here?
Basically, I have come for a...
you know, conference.
Can you do me a favor?
I can lay down my life,
without any condition.
Tell me what to do.
You're not needed anymore...
And what's funny is,
Sinha uncle, he's searching
all over the city for his daughter.
Searching, searching...
But his daughter is right here.
All that's fine,
but what's the plan ahead.
Plan remains the same.
We'll call a taxi
and you two go straight to Bodh Gaya.
And you two?
Beyond this is outside my coverage area.
You got to handle it.
If you make it out alive,
then come see me in the evening.
We've a meeting with Muktiyar.
I remember.
Hey antivirus,
don't take it too seriously.
Thanks.
No virus.
Well, see you then. Take care.
<i>Bars... that don't break</i>
Think again... I say it's a bad idea.
<i>Love breaks it all</i>
Nimmi, I am tired of eloping with you.
Now that we're here, let's deal with it.
Nimmi.
That double barrel
which hangs on uncle's wall.
Does it work?
Papa would clean it every Sunday.
I guess it works then.
Doesn't matter, uncle is a big miser.
He won't waste 80 rupees bullet on me.
Yeah, but he will definitely kick you.
You can take it for me.
So that's your love, I should take
the beating for you.
No...

In the labyrinthine lanes of Old Delhi resides Khuddoos (Manoj Bajpayee), a reclusive middle-aged man who spies on his neighbours through hidden cameras. His only companion is Ganeshi (Ranvir Shorey), a friend who checks in on him and manages his daily needs. Khuddoos, a mechanic by profession, immerses himself in the routine of his solitary existence until one day when he is visited by his estranged brother, Shaukat. Shaukat requests an old necklace of their mother for his daughter's wedding.

That night, while finding the necklace, Khuddoos overhears someone in a nearby house engaged in domestic violence. Shocked, Khuddoos tries to use his cameras to find the house but fails. The house belongs to Liakat (Neeraj Kabi) and his wife Saira (Shahana Goswami). Liakat works as a butcher and regularly beats his son, Idris (Om Singh). Idris is a curious boy who runs around exploring the neighbourhood and peeping into other's homes and loves his mother more that anything else.

Khuddoos explains the situation to Ganeshi, who advises him to stop meddling in others' business and to focus on his job. Shaukat returns and expresses disgust with Khuddoos' solitary and unhygienic lifestyle. Gradually, Khuddoos becomes fixated on finding Idris but is unable to do so consistently. This affects his sleep and health, eventually causing him to default on his shop's rent, leading to its closure. Meanwhile, Liakat becomes more lenient with Idris, refraining from punishing him and showing a sudden change in attitude, even though Idris remains uncomfortable due to his father's true nature.

One day, Idris catches his father involved in an affair with another woman, he plans to run away with his mother and baby brother. Idris accuses his father of the baby's death and is severely beaten by him. Subsequently, Idris goes to the railway station, attempting to run away, but is found by Liakat and beaten again.Meanwhile, Khuddoos, still unable to find Idris, scours the streets in an attempt to identify his house, but his efforts are futile. He eventually ends up drunk and arrested after neighbors complain, feeling unsafe around him. However, he is bailed out by Ganeshi, who advises him to stop fixating on finding Idris' house and to move on with his life.

That night, Idris suffocates Liakat to death. A shocked Khuddoos, hearing the struggle, breaks the wall to reach Idris' house, only to discover water pipes on the other side. As he dusts off an old photo, it reveals Idris, Liakat, Saira, and the baby. The revelation unfolds that Idris was Khuddoos' younger self, and the traumatic incident led to his estrangement from the family. After many days, when Ganeshi and the neighbors enter the house, they find Khuddoos missing, and Ganeshi learns the truth upon seeing the photo.",2799,NA,NA,NA

Hello.
Hello.
Sweety. - Hello, Pammi..
Hello, Shammi.
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.
Have you seen Aditya's father around?
I've been looking all over for him.
If a Punjabi is missing for a long time..
..then you should go look at the bar.
That's where one can normally find them.
It's the pride of Punjabis.
Absolutely right.
I'll go take a look.
You enjoy yourself. - Yeah.
Go find him.
Make a large one.
Mr. Sodhi. - Mr. Khurana..

Have a look at the best looking bike ever to hit the Indian roads.
Four-Stroke, Single Cylinder. DTSi Engine.
450cc Displacement.
It's the lightest and most powerful bike in its segment..
..and the most economical.
With a mileage of 45 km/L.. in city conditions.
And to top it all.. it's the most affordable thing.
It's not a bike, it's a phenomenon!
And that's what we call it.
Phenomenon.
Wow Adi, that's amazing!
Did you understand anything?
Yeah. - What?
You're the luckiest guy in the world.
You've a hot bike.. and a hotter wife.
Sir; there's a conference-call for you.
Excuse me. - Bye.
Riya. - Yes.
I just want to say thank you.
You fulfilled all my friend's dreams. - No, no, no..
Don't thank me.
It's all because of you.
Because of me? - Yes.
Why?
Well.. Adi told me, that you locked him in his room..
..on the day of his MBA exam.
Are you serious? He told you that.
If you hadn't done that..
..then he would be doing some boring job right now.
He wouldn't have designed the bike.. or come in my life.
So thanks to you.
Are you two going to share all the credits..
..or leave something for me too?
Papa.
Hi, dear. - Hi, uncle.
Hello.
The entire credit goes to you.
You gave Adi the biggest opportunity of his life.
Well..
Hello, sir. - Hello, young man.
By the way, when is the bike's launch date?
This bike will be launched right after Adi and Riya's marriage.
And this will be my wedding present to both of them.
You're coming to the wedding, aren't you?
Uncle, if I don't dance in front of his mare..
..he won't get married.
Funny girl.
Enjoy yourselves. - Okay, bye.
It's a message from mom.
She wants me to have lunch with her.
Do you have to go? - Yes, Adi.
Mom's here only for few days.
I'll have to go. I want to go.
I'll see you later.
Bye. - Bye.
Adi.
Don't be so sad.
She's going to be yours forever.
Listen.. how about we go get some?
Come on.
So what's new?
So good, dude.
Another one.
Did you like Riya?
If I say no, will you cancel the wedding?
Of course I like her.
She's beautiful, she loves you.
And most importantly.. she's fulfilling your dream.
Really?
I am very lucky.
What?
Riya's turned you into a dude.
You're eating roadside snacks in a tie.
Hero..
What did you do?
You spoiled my dress.
I bought this especially for today.
Brother, please give me some water.
Sweet or sour?
Idiots, don't laugh.
It's my birthday dress.
When was your birthday? - Today's my birthday, you fool.
Why do you think..

Girls are losing their sense of taste.
They don't like decent boys.
Forget girls, even boys are losing taste.
Better be careful. - Thank you.
Or some boy might fall for you.
Oh granny..
All the oldies think about God in the morning.
And listen to the things you're saying.
Who are you calling old?
I'm in my golden years.
Golden years.
Come on.. come down and have your breakfast.
Congratulations. Get up.
Good morning.
I don't want your wishes. - Why?
Why didn't you and granny show up?
Two days ago granny had too many kebabs for starters.
She had a bad stomach.
How could I have left her?
By the way, dude.. I've heard that the girl's really cute.
Gulabo.. my girl's really cute, but your girl's spoilt.
Last night she was so high that..
..she was telling us about her boyfriend.
She was right.
Didn't you tell them about Jay?
I was about to tell them, but then..
Fine, tell them later.
Now get up.. I made stuffed bread for everyone.
Come down and get your breakfast.
Get up.. come on, hurry up.
What's..
I mean.. what's all this about?
So.. I and Jay have been dating for few months.
You really have a boyfriend? - Yeah!
Wow!
Why are you so excited?
Do you guys want to meet him? - Yeah.
Come on.
Oh no.. I can't face Jay like this.
I haven't even washed my face yet.
You won't look any better even if you do.
Just shut up.
I'll just be back.
Hello.
Well, I was expecting Anushka.
So you're the gang, right? - Yes.
Anushka's told me about everyone.
So wait.. you're Petha. - Of course.
Batlu. - Yes.
And you're the gorgeous Nikki, right?
Oh.. thanks, Jay.
We were all really excited to meet you.
You know.. - Where's Adi?
Hey, brother. How are you doing?
How was the engagement?
It was nice. - Good.
And Batli.. still a virgin.
My virginity's famous in London as well.
I haven't found anyone yet, Jay.
You will..
Jay, are you done with?
No, no, stay there.. I'll join you in a minute.
Okay.
Move.
Hi, baby. - Hey, sweetheart.
How are you? - I am good.. and I'm having a blast with my friends.
But I am really missing you.
I miss you too.
When are you coming back? - Really, really, really soon.
Alright, Sweety.. I got to finish some work.
So I'll talk later, okay? - Yeah, no problem.
Love you. - Love you too.
Bye. - Bye, darling. See you.
Come on, guys, let's go.
So how was Jay?
I know.. he's not exactly Tom Cruise, but he's really nice.
And.. - There was a nude girl in his room.
What? - Honestly.
We all saw it. - Yes, Lambu. She was nude.
I mean she was completely nude.
She saw her too.
On one side.. he was saying ""Love you baby, miss you baby""..
..and on the other side ""Wait I am not finished yet"".
Why are you all laughing?
Tell them.
Guys, just chill.
Jay is a painter. - So? So?
And his specialty is nude paintings.
The girl you saw in his room.. must be some model.
Ohh.. I see.
Granny, do you like a guy.. who paints nude girls?
Son.. we're satisfied that he's a boy.
Why are you over-reacting?
That's Jay's profession.
And anyway, he's Lambu's boyfriend, not yours.
And she's not married to him.
Well.. I haven't yet, but we're going to?
Really? Are you serious?
Adi, why don't you invite Jay to your wedding?
We'll have loads of fun.
I say.. let's get Anushka and Jay married as well.
She barely likes any boy.
Now finally she likes someone.
If we delay.. she'll change her mind again.
Granny.. what are you saying?
This isn't the way to get married.
You never planned for anything before. - Of course.
Adi, it's a very good idea.
And we're all going to be there.
And.. we'll invite Jay and his family.
You don't worry.
Yeah, no need to worry.
Son, Jay doesn't have a family.
Then talk to Jay directly.
Talk to him now..Talk to him now.
Nice.
Talk to him now.
Riya.. there's a slight change of plan.
What? Are you marrying someone else?
You won't get away so easily.
You know, Anushka has a boyfriend.
Jay.
You know, these guys are so crazy..
..they're saying call Jay here and get married.
Crazy.. idea.
Yes, Adi, I think it's a fabulous idea.
But it's not a bad idea. - Jay.
In fact, it's a great idea.
If you were in front of me..
..then once again I would've gone on my knees..
..and asked you..
Will you marry me, Anushka?
Hey listen..
Riya loved the idea.
Congratulations. - Awesome.
Congratulations.
Guys, Jay didn't like the idea. - Why.
In fact, he loved it.
Really?.. Yes!
So Adi and Anushka will tie the knot..
In Thailand!
Granny.. in Thailand.
Granny.. move.. it's an emergency.
Drink.
All the way you kept saying ""it's an emergency"".
And now you're drinking.
It's a welcome drink.
You're just.. - What?
You're too much. - What?
Forget it. - Why?
Carry on then.
Wife's angry.
Now that's Thailand.
Vodka.. at the arrival.
Oh my, God. Let's go for shopping.
Ohhh.. it's a virgin.
Granny.. can you tell by looking at it? - No.
It's the smell.
I think I'll have to arrange for myself.
The rest of the arrangements are in your room, ma'am.
You will find the best liquors in the world in your mini-bar.
I am General Manager of the Hotel, Luvinder Kapoor.
You can call me Luv Kapoor. My card.
Gulabo. - What?
My name.
Welcome to the JW Marriot, please.
Thank you.
I hope there are no chances of Tsunami. - No, no.
I am so happy you came. - I'm so happy to be here.
Excuse me, sir.
You must be the groom, Aditya. - Yes.
Nice to meet you. - Same here.
And of course, you must be the bride.
She's a bride, but of a different groom.
I am Adi's bride.
I am sorry. I am terribly sorry.
I was deceived.
It's okay.
Actually, we're best friends.
My groom Jay will arrive tomorrow. - Lovely.
Well, I hope you have a comfortable stay till then.
Sure. - Thank you.
Right. - Thank you.
Sir.. - Yes.
Do you have sandwich massage?
Excuse me?
Well young man, we've sandwiches in the room service.
And we've massage in the Spa.
So.. enjoy.
Stupid. - It was just a thought, so I asked him.
Come in.
Please keep it here. - Okay, sir.
Hey.
Hi.
Wait, wait, wait.. what are you doing?
Taking a bath. - Meaning?
Taking a bath.
You can join me.
Why are you taking a bath in my room?
Why not?
Are you thinking you will stay in my room?
Of course.
No way.
Take your luggage and get out.
But, Riya.. - Are you crazy?
Mom and dad will be here any minute.
I am going to marry their daughter. - Yes..
We still have a few days left.
After that, you can stay as long as you want.
But now just go.
Why are you behaving like this with your future husband?
I am behaving the way I should.
Adi. - Fine, I am going.
At least give me a kiss before I go. - No, Adi.
Just go.
What's this? - What?
Adi.. !
You're so.. cute.
Where is it?
Sweety, where's the flush?
These days they've sensors.
Wave your hand under the tap and the water comes out.
But what do I wave here?
My head.
Oh, God.. what did you give me?
Coming.
You're just.. - What?
Too much.
Sensor. Sensor. - Yeah, sensor.
What are you two doing in the bathroom together?
We're playing a game, but you should've knocked before coming in.
Why? You two are not on a honeymoon here..
..that you'll get disturbed.
Listen to that..
He isn't even married yet, and he's already got questions.
I wonder what's going to happen after the marriage.
He's my son.
He'll do good even after the marriage.
Look, Adi.. your father-in-law might be..
..a big manufacturer of motorcycles.
But we Sodhis are no less.
Your father's absolutely right.
Don't be scared of Riya.
Mom.. I am not a coward like papa.
Naughty. - Adi, you're feeling really brave now..
..but by the time your honeymoon's over, you'll be tamed..
..or else you can change my name.
By the way.. this is a really romantic place.
So.. - I say we should not waste any time.
It's the modern age..
Bed her.. before the marriage.
Riya doesn't like these things, papa.
This means you've been thinking about it.
That's like a Sodhi. Give me a hug, son.
What are you teaching your son?
I am teaching him something I couldn't learn myself.
Come on, family hug.
You're too much.
Gulabo.. - What are you doing?
I am so excited, I never thought I'll get married so quickly.
Yeah.. looking at your actions, it's hard to say you're getting married.
Tell me something.. have you finished preparing.
You're missing mom-dad too, aren't you?
I am missing them too.
You know.. if they were here, they would've been so excited.. - Why?
Did I leave any void, dear?
No, Gulabo?
So tell me.. do you remember..
..who was your first childhood friend?
You!
And who endured your tantrums?
You did, Gulabo!
And remember, who made you taste whiskey first?
Of course, it can only be you.
I am sorry.
You're the best.
Look, don't ever say such things again and hurt me.
When my heart aches, I need my medicine.
What? What medicine?
Oh my, God.. Gulabo, you're too much.
You want.
Punjabi folk song.
I love all this, so pretty.
Listen.. was your Ravinder always like this..
..or did he become like this now?
What do you mean?
Don't mind.. but he looks a bit lusty to me.
I doubt.. he troubled you a lot on your first night.
Tell me the truth.
No, no.. he couldn't do a thing. - Why? Was he drunk?
No, no.. when he came to me at night, I started crying.
I said 'I am missing my mom'.
He kept cajoling me all night.
No wonder he's been venting his wedding night frustration till now.
Granny, you're just..
Granny, it must be different during your time, isn't it?
I mean.. did people go on honeymoon?
We never went anywhere.
We would do it at every opportunity we got.
You're too much, granny. - She's just too much.
Oh my, God! They're so openly talking about their honeymoon.
Like.. I'm not going to tell them.. what will happen on my honeymoon.
Oh really.. as if we don't know..
..what's going to happen on your honeymoon.
Sorry.
Sweety. - Yes.
Where did you go on your honeymoon? - I went to Goa.
What did you see?
I didn't see anything in Goa? - Why?
I just saw the ceiling fan and came back.
Guys, I've a really exciting plan for today. - What?
What are you planning without me?
You're also part of it.
We're all going.. deep-sea diving.
Wow.. - Nice.
One minute. I can't come.
Why? - Why?
I'm scared of deep water.
I am scared of the sea, Adi. - What?
Adi, you didn't know Riya's scared of deep water.
We don't bathe together that I would know.
I am sorry, Riya.
Come on, we'll be together. - No, no, no.
Are you sure? - Yes, baby.
You guys go. And you guys have lots of fun. - Yes.
I'll see you later.
Bye. - Bye.
Come soon, I'll get Anushka and see you guys.
Done.
Anushka, where are you?
I've just come into the lobby.
I am in the lobby as well.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Then hang up.
Ma'am, your car is ready. - Thank you.
Anushka - What?
Are you going somewhere? - Yes.
I made plans for deep-sea diving, with you.
The entire gang's waiting.
I can't come. I'm going to pick up Jay.
Oh..you're looking really hot. - Thank you.
Yeah, Anushka..you're looking like a woman. - Hey..
But how are you going to jump in the water in these clothes?
She isn't jumping in the water. - Why?
She's not coming with us.
What? - Why?
What do you mean? Jay's coming.
I am going to the airport to pick him up.
Let's send a car to pick up Jay.
Jay's coming here to marry me, not the car.
Anushka isn't coming either. Nor is Riya.
Idea! Why don't we all go pick up Jay?
What an idea?
Anushka, do you mind?
Of course I mind.
We don't care. - Come on, guys, let's go.
We'll never break this friendship.
We'll give up..
What's that?
Anushka, turn left.. turn left.
What's that board? - I don't know.
It has your name written on it.
Are you guys playing some kind of prank on me? - No way.
What can be a bigger prank than you getting married.
I think we should find out.
Yeah, let's go.
Something's definitely wrong.
First left, now right. What's going on here?
Anushka, turn left.
So many balloons.
Something's definitely wrong.
Jay! Oh my God.
Get down.
Batli, get down.
Jay. - Anushka.
When did you get so filmy?
My God..this is so special.
It is for my most special lady.
My most beautiful.
How sweet. But how did you arrange all this?
With the help of a genie.
That I should've guessed.
Thank you.
Oh..this is called love.
This is called love at first sight.
Not first, it's second sight.
She's the girl we saw on Skype. - Yeah.
Why are you guys standing there?
Come meet Jay. - Hi, Jay.
Hi, Jay. How are you?
How was the flight?
Hi, Jay. Finally. - Yeah, finally.
Well, those are my friends.
Derek, Paula and Roxie.
Hi.
Hi. - Roxie.
Hi. - I love you.
I knew it..
I love you.
How's Gulabo? - She's good. Let's go meet her.
Let's go to the hotel.
Yeah..
Nice guy, huh.
What do you say, sir?
Your arrangement was fantastic. - Well, thank you, sir.
Excuse me.
Sweety, what song did you select for our dance?
I was thinking about that old number.
Everyone's been talking about our love.
Sweety, what a selection.
Thank you.
You remember. - Why wouldn't I?
I would always stare at Mumtaz's hairstyle.
And I was looking at her tight sari.
What? - It was too tight, that's why.
See that.
She's teaching her father to dance.
You know..she's going to make you dance to her tunes as well.
Forget about me..tell your partner to rehearse for the dance.
Jay doesn't need to rehearse, okay. - I see.
When Jay and I come on the dance floor..
..we're going to be so awesome, everyone will be mesmerized.
I can't do it. I can't do it.
Papa, mom has already learned all the dance steps.
If she dances better than you, will you be able to take it?
What? Your mom's going to dance too? - Yes. With you.
This must be her idea.
She always wants to make me dance to her tune.
Papa, it's my idea.
Dear..I thought you're smart..like me.
Papa, please. Enough talking, and start dancing.
Come on, like this.
Since mom's dancing, I will have to.
3.. 4.. 5.. 6..
Very good.
Again.
Batli, teach me properly.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
First of all, let's begin with applauding for the two lovely couples..
..whose wedding you're here for.
Adi and Riya.
Congratulations, guys.
Thanks.
Anushka and Jay.
Jay..
Thank you, people.
A poet once said that marriage is like an old wine.
Well said!
The older it gets, the more high it gets you.
Yeah right.
Well, according to me, Mr. Kapoor..
..marriage is like a chewing gum.
In the beginning it tastes sweet.
But later it tastes like rubber.
Maybe you're right, Mr. Sodhi.
Let's see how sweet your chewing gum..
I mean your marriage still is.
This is the theme of the party.
How well do you know your partner?
So..Mr. Sodhi, do you remember your first meeting with Sweety?
I do, Mr. Kapoor, I still do.
Sweety was wearing a red color sari.
I should've understood that..
..it's a sign of danger. - Oh, Lord!
Mr. Kumar. - Yeah.
When you met Amrita for the first time, how was she looking?
Mr. Kapoor, what did you just ask?
You should've asked him something business related..
..and he would've replied promptly.
But he won't remember our first meeting.
Well..she was looking beautiful.
She was wearing a white dress.
Her hair was untied, 'bindi' on the forehead..
..and a red purse in her hand.
Wow!
Well said.
Well..okay.
If you don't mind, ma'am.
Do you remember your first love? - Forget my first love.
I remember my latest.
Just some time ago, a very handsome guy..
..whispered something into my ears.
The black suit on his fair body looked just dapper.
And his brown eyes..like two pegs of whiskey.
And the print on his tie.
Mr. Jay, what were you saying? - No..nothing..
Luv, I haven't finished yet.
Yes, but..Mr. Jay, what were you saying?
Tell us something about Anushka we don't know.
I am not good with words. - Come on.
Speak up, son.
I am just a painter, Gulabo..
..but I would like to say something today.
Wonderful.
It's not easy to make a place for yourself..
..in Anushka's heart.
And no one knows it better than me.
But if she gives you a place in her heart..
..then you're locked there forever.
Brilliant.
I love you. - I love you.
Well, Ms. Riya. - Yes.
Do you know anything special about Adi..
..which you would like to share with us?
Me? No, no, no..
Come on, Riya.
Please. Come on.
Speak up.
Adi..
Adi has many special qualities.
He's..very polite.
He's..very generous, very helpful.
And most importantly, he's very intelligent.
In fact, he's a genius.
Wow!
Great. Good going, thank you madam.
Listen, listen..attention please.
We all know that about Adi.
Right? - Yes.
But there's one thing that only I know.
Which one. - Tell us.
Tell us..
We should know about Adi's hidden talent as well.
You're going to love it.
Okay.
So..we all know that Adi is a fabulous dancer. Right? - Yes.
But, Adi is not a regular dancer.
He is the best cabaret dancer.
Cabaret.
I will kill you.
Cabaret dancers are really cute.
Right. As if you've seen cabarets.
Honestly.
You know, whenever Adi would get ragged in college..
..he would do this amazing cabaret.
Come, show us.
No!
I am not going.
Come on.
Why not?
Come on, yes.
Adi! Adi! Adi!
Cabaret! Cabaret! Cabaret!
Come on, son.
Come on, show us.
Come on, Adi.
Cabaret! Cabaret!
Since I saw..your rosy eyes.
My heart's on a high.
Hold me..O friends.
As I am out of control.
Since I saw..your rosy eyes.
My heart's on a high.
Hold me..O friends.
As I am out of control.
You said you don't know cabaret.
I can watch and follow.
My heart's filled with your dreams.
Like a wall filled with images.
Why did I fall for you?
I am angry over love.
I am ruined..after losing my heart.
I am no longer good for anything.
What do I say..beloved.
Your bewitching eyes..pierced my heart.
Since I saw..your rosy eyes.
My heart's on a high.
Since I saw..your rosy eyes.
My heart's on a high.
Hold me..O friends.
As I am out of control.
Amazing, son.
Hi.
If you're not waiting for someone..
..then..can I sit here?
I stopped waiting a long time ago.
Please, sit.
Looking nice.
I always look nice.
Maybe you just noticed it.
No, I mean it.
Maybe you started looking more beautiful after we parted ways.
Thank you.
You don't look bad either.
I guess you have put on some weight.
Why? No one to control your diet?
When I had you, my diet would stay in control, and my life too.
But you wanted total control over everything.
You even wanted to run our family like a corporate organization.
And how could a progressive woman like you..
..endure someone else taking decisions around the house.
Right?
Like your decision to send five year old Riya to boarding?
While doing that, you didn't realize that..
..while your business and Page 3 status was important for you..
..Riya was important for me.
You were responsible for driving me away, Kumar.
Amrita, please.
After you two left, I realized..
..that a home is not made of bricks and stones.
But..
But your ego stopped you..
..from calling me back home, right?
I don't know, Amrita, but..
I missed you.
I missed you terribly.
Did you miss me?
Maybe even more than you.
Scarlet. - My favorite color.
And the name of our daughter too.
Why daughter?
Because she will be as beautiful as you.
Jay, am I really that beautiful? - Of course.
From head to toe.
You've the most beautiful feet in the world.
I love you, Jay.
What happened?
What happened?
I am sorry..but that Adi..
Crazy.
You know, that day when he did the cabaret.
He came and said to me..
You know, if you marry Jay..
..you'll see nude girls in your house all the time.
What the hell..
I will do this every day after marriage. - What?
But I love you.
Please, go. - But..
What's wrong? You look really happy.
Batli just proposed to Roxie for the ninth time.
Eleven. - So what?
Roxie baby, I love you.
I am sorry.
I am really sorry.
It's okay.
Where's Anushka? - She went with Jay to the waterfall.
Guess they want to spend some time alone.
Hi, Jay. - Hi, guys.
What are you guys doing here?
What are we doing here?
We're here to disturb you two.
We thought Jay's making some obscene painting of you.
Rascal.
Wow!
It's an amazing place.
Don't think, Adi, let's go.
One.
Two.
And three.
Come on, Lambu.
Batli, you too.
Run, run.
Jay, come on. - No, no, you carry on.
Petha, come on.
They are all crazy.
But that's what I like about you.
Come on, run. - I am not coming.
You go. - Come on.
Come on.
Adi, you're going to lose.
Come on, Lambu.
I won!
Oh my God!
Mom.
Riya.
Come in.
Mom, what are you doing in dad's room?
Dear, I..
Just listen to me.
Amrita, I was thinking..
You two..kept meeting and never told me.
No. - Dear..how this happened, even we don't know.
What do you mean, mom?
Look, dear..relationships are strange.
Even if you stop holding hands, doesn't mean the relationship is over.
You know what, your mom and I came here for your wedding.
We met..and we realized..
..that we lost the best years of our lives, because of our ego.
But..we love each other.
If you two had seen through your egos earlier..
..then I wouldn't have received your love in bits and pieces.
Sorry, dear. We're so sorry.
Don't be sorry.
I am happy.
Just come here.
I love you. - We love you.
Tell me..do we still look good together?
The best couple on earth..
Ever!
Love you.
Punjabi folk song.
Punjabi folk song.
No.. no.. - Please..
Days just flew by so soon.
You had just arrived from London.
And now..it's time for you to go back to London.
You're marrying a guy from London.
But don't forget our culture, our tradition..
..and the promises of marriage.
Mom, what promises are they talking about?
The seven promises of the seven nuptial rounds, dear.
Where the husband and wife promise each other..
..to be each other's strength, support each other in every situation..
..and..not just husband-wife, but they will be best friends forever.
But Adi's best friend is Anushka.
Before his marriage.
After the marriage, Adi will be your best friend.
And Anushka's best friend will be Jay.
Understand.
I'll be right back.
Okay. - Okay, mom.
I'll just come.
Punjabi folk song.
Punjabi folk song.
Punjabi folk song.
Anushka. - Two minutes, I'll be back.
I want to talk to you. - Yes.
For the first time in my life..
..I am observing a fast.
Of Karva Chauth!
Riya, you actually believe in all this?
Yeah! I want Adi in every lifetime.
Okay, listen. Don't tell Adi about this, please.
I want this to be a surprise for him.
In fact, I told no one about this. Not even mom.
But listen, I need your help.
Will you please bring Adi at the poolside when I break my fast?
Riya, oh my God, no.
I'm sorry, I can't do this.
Anushka, please.
Please don't refuse.
Adi will go anywhere with you.
Come on.. - He never refuses you.
Riya, this is so silly.
Anushka, come on. For our sake.
Please, please, please, just say yes.
Yes. - Okay.
Thank you.
I'll call you when we're ready, okay. - Yes.
Thank you.
But Adi's best friend is Anushka.
Before his marriage.
After the marriage, Adi will be your best friend.

Everyone's been talking about our love.
Everyone knows..
Everyone's been talking about our love.
Everyone knows..
Riya. - Hi.
Good morning.
Listen, I am really sorry about last night.
You know, actually I slept early.
And missed your calls.
It's a good thing you didn't receive my calls.
You know what happened? - What happened?
When I couldn't talk to you..
..I went to Adi's room looking for him.
And he was shocked to see me all decked up.
Nice. - Nice?
Nice happened after that.
When I told him that I was fasting for him.
He was so happy to hear that.
He made me drink the juice and broke my fast.
Can you imagine Adi doing all of that?
It was the most beautiful night of my life.
And all thanks to you.
I am so happy.
Girls, you can plan your honeymoon later.
First come and play this singing game with us.
Yamma Yamma... Yamma Yamma O the beautiful ambiance.
Tonight's the night to..
Anushka, you're on the wrong side.
You're on my team. Come on. Fast.
Come, come, come.
Sing something starting from 'H'.
I can't live without you.
I don't exist without you.
If I separate from you, I'll lose myself.
Because it's you.. it's you.
You're my life.
Wait, wait. I know this one.
I don't know how much I truly love you.
But I know that I can't live without you.
That's a really romantic number.
But I know that I can't live without you.
I wonder what path..my crazy heart's heading down.
Some broken dream's still pricking in my eye.
The fake assurances..make me cry.
What's this punishment..O Lord.
Tell me..what fate wants.
Tell me.. why are our paths separate?
O fate..
The moments immersed in darkness.
How do I bring them in the light again?
Do I burn like a passionate lover?
Or like the candle.
But I've to burn all night..in any condition.
What's this punishment.. O Lord.
Tell me..what fate wants.
Tell me.. why are our paths separate?
O fate..
O fate..
Batli. - Yes,
Your Sweety aunty. - Yeah.
Wonderful person.
But she gets angry over small things.
Last year, exactly a month before my anniversary..
..she got angry over a really small thing.
What happened?
I had an affair with someone.
And I thought..she's my wife, I love her.
So I must tell her first.
And so I did, and she got angry.
I wonder why.
Cheers, Mr. Kumar. - Cheers.
She can't see me happy, I don't know why.
Jay, come, come. - Hi.
Hello, Jay. - Hi.
What do you do? - I..
Uncle, Jay is a nude painter.
Nude painter? - Yeah.
Come closer son, don't just stand there.
Son..half nude or full nude?
No, uncle..he means I paint nude models.
Oh.. - There's Jay.
Gulabo. - Jay, sweety.
Come here.
Congratulations, he's a nice boy. - Thank you.
And the best thing is he's a painter.
Wow!
Really?
Jay, why don't you paint me some day?
Curse you.
What happened?
Go get ready, don't you want to go to the party?
She wants her painting made.
Go.
Come on. Let's go. - Painting..
Hi. - Hey. You're looking nice.
Thanks.
Anushka said you're going to set the dance floor on fire.
I am not too sure about that.
Why?
You must have made many girls dance to your tune in London.
Well..that's true, but the situation here is different.
First time in my life I met a girl..
..that makes me dance to her tunes.
Jay, Adi..what are you doing up on the stairs?
This is a musical night.
Someone play the music.
Dance. - Right.
Wow!
Welcome, son.
A beautiful girl walks by..
A thorn has pierced your feet, damsel.
A beautiful girl walks by..
A thorn has pierced your feet, damsel.
Don't lock..lock horns with love.
Or it will be a big mess, beloved.
Don't lock..lock horns with love.
Or it will be a big mess, beloved.
Know who I am..
I am a really nice boy.
I am a really nice boy.
I want to lock..lock horns with love.
Let there be a mess..I don't care.
Move aside.
You're a really bad boy.
You're a really bad boy.
The thread of the veil is stuck in the door.
Brother-in-law quarrels with his sister-in-law.
Younger brother-in-law, you will be blessed.
Don't quarrel with her, you have only one sister-in-law.
You've got no say, but you make tall claims.
Take a look at yourself in the mirror.
Why do you fight with me?
Why are you upset with me?
My love's really deep.
Take a dip in love.
My heart's totally crazy about you.
You know..
You're a really bad boy.
You're a really bad boy.
You follow me around..or you stare at me.
Your actions are so cheap.
I turned into Romeo only for you.
Let's start our very own love story.
Let's set things straight.
May our companion be super-hit.
Stay away from me
You're a really bad boy.
I am a really nice boy.
You're a really bad boy.
I am a really nice boy.
You're a really bad boy.
I am a really nice boy.
You're a really bad boy.
The thread of the veil is stuck in the door.
Brother-in-law quarrels with his sister-in-law.
Younger brother-in-law, you will be blessed.
Don't quarrel with her, you have only one sister-in-law.
Brother-in-law quarrels with his sister-in-law.
Let's go.
You think there's something between them..
No, no, it's nothing.
I didn't say anything.
So how did you know what I was going to say?
Excuse me, ma'am. May I get you a chair?
No, thank you. - Well..sure.
Pardon me, ma'am.
This is the only aspect of the moon we've seen.
Have you seen the other aspect of the moon?
No.
I didn't either.
And I never saw the bride thinking all alone..on the Musical Night.
This happens..when there's a twist in the love story.
I'm trying to understand whose love-story is it.
It's so funny..
..but what are you doing here at this hour?
Why aren't you asleep?
Two kinds of people don't sleep at night.
Those who are in love..
And those..who never got love.
But..only one kind of people say such philosophical things.
Someone who don't get their love.
Am I right?
You know you're beautiful, and intelligent too.
And that's a lethal combination.
You didn't answer my question.
And stubborn.
Well..
There was a time when I was in love. - I knew it.
And did she? Did she love you?
Yes, of course.
So why was your love-story incomplete?
I was too late.
By the time I could confess my love..
..her parents got her married.
And then I realized, that love isn't enough.
One should have the courage to get your love.
Have a good night, ma'am.
The number you've called is not answering.
The number you've called is currently unavailable..
Hello. - Good morning.
Hi, could you please connect me to room 550, Aditya's room.
Sure, ma'am.
Ma'am, the number is busy.
Hi, aunty.
Where's Adi?
Thank God you're here.
Come in, quickly.
Things are in a mess since morning. - Aunty..
Do something. - We are. We are.
Here you go, dear?
What's this?
These are Riya's nuptial ornaments.
Aunty.. - Did you pack the sweets?
Hurry up. - Aunty, where's Adi?
Why would he be here?
He's downstairs in the lawn, the functions are about to begin.
Come with me, quickly.
No, aunty..I won't come.
Why?
I mean..I'm not ready yet.
You don't need to get ready.
These are not your ornaments.
Hurry up..we're getting late. - Coming.
Decorate the palanquin, the wedding procession has arrived.
It's the night when the bride leaves.
It's the time..when the eyes shed tears.
Dreams are turning into reality.
Decorate the palanquin, the wedding procession has arrived.
It's the night when the bride leaves.
O Wanderer..don't go.
O Wanderer..don't go.
Who are you looking for?
O Wanderer..don't go.
O Wanderer..don't go.
I don't want to let go.
Please stay with me some more.
I don't want to let go.
O Wanderer..don't go.
O Wanderer..don't go.
Why did you stop?
Adi, are you happy?
What do you mean?
Aren't you happy? - I am very happy.
All my dreams are coming true.
If you're happy, then smile.
I am confused.
I don't know who to share my confusion with.
Sir, pardon me if I say so.
You should share these things with Riya ma'am.
After all, you're going to marry her.
Why? What happened?
You're not comfortable with Riya? - No, that's not it.
Then what is it?
You like her, don't you?
Of course.
She's beautiful, caring, from a good family.
My parents like her.
I can't find a better girl.
But do you love her?
Yes..I think so.
I mean..I thought so.
I don't know, I am really confused.
Tell me one thing.
Which are the most memorable moments in your life?
Mr. Kapoor, I'm trying to understand what's going on with me right now.
And you're playing games with me.
Sir, I am only trying to help you find your answers.
Tell me..which are the best moments in your life?
Think.
Well..I can't forget that day..
Happy birthday, Adi.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday, Adi.
And after cutting the cake..
..the moment when I tasted beer first.
Come on.
Adi! Adi! Adi! Adi!
Only Anushka can be so crazy.
He's gone, Batli.
Adi! Adi! Adi!
You drank around three liters..just tasting.
Wow!
Let's move on, what else?
The moment..when I bought the first bike.
Thanks to Anushka.
So, friends.
Welcome to the boxing competition.
The winner gets a brand new car.
If you lose, you get the bike.
And friends, hold your heart.
Because the loser gets a beating..
..as well as a new motorcycle.
And the first bike-ride after getting beaten up.
Yes!
Come on, let's go.
And the moment when Anushka..
She turned all my moments from a dream to a reality.
And suddenly one day, she fought with me over a small thing..
..and went to London.
Anushka. - There you are.
Now you know it. - Yes..Anushka.
Absolutely.
I've been wondering..what's wrong with me.
Everything seems absolutely new.
O beloved..what condition is this?
Feels a lot like love.
What have you done to me?
O beloved..what condition is this?
Feels a lot like love.
What have you done to me?
You're the tune..that struck automatically.
You're a secret..that unveiled by itself.
O beloved..what condition is this?
Feels a lot like love.
What have you done to me?
My dreams pleaded and my eyes complained.
But I couldn't sleep.
Each breath recommended and the heart became audacious.
It was the limit.
The heart fell in love.
The heart fell in love.
Just like a soft smile that spurted on my lips, but..
..my eyes were filled with tears.
You're that tear, beloved.
I am na ve, surprised..and a little troubled.
What do I explain to myself?
Do I laugh or do I cry, beloved.
How do I suppress my desires?
How do I hide whatever's happening?
O beloved..what condition is this?
Feels a lot like love.
What have you done to me?
O beloved..what condition is this?
Feels a lot like love.
What have you done to me?
My dreams pleaded and my eyes complained.
But I couldn't sleep.
Each breath recommended and the heart became audacious.
It was the limit.
The heart fell in love.
The heart fell in love.
Hello.
Hi..what are you doing?
Getting ready. Jay's invited me for dinner.
Okay..can you come meet me?
Adi, I just said I'm going for dinner with Jay.
But I must meet you urgently.
Please. Please. Please.
I don't have the time. - I don't either.
Please, I want to say to you.
Please. Please, listen, Anushka.
It's important.
I wonder what path..my crazy heart's heading down.
Some broken dream's still pricking in my eye.
The fake assurances..make me cry.
What's this punishment..O Lord.
Tell me..what fate wants.
You're looking really beautiful.
Adi, whatever you called me here to say, it better be important.
There was a confusion between my heart and mind for a long time.
The heart wouldn't agree with what the mind said.
And the mind says..
But now.. - You have to listen to one of them, Adi.
There can be nothing more important..
..than what I want to say today.
Anushka..when two people fall in love, and can't be together..
..they either blame the stars or the society.
Or the situation.
But the problem is somewhere inside them.
I realized today, when two people are in love..
..they should say it immediately.
Otherwise..
Otherwise.. - Otherwise what, Adi?
Otherwise they lose that moment..
..and it never comes back.
Anushka, I..
I..
Hello. - Hello.
Yes, Kumar sir.
Where are you?
I am with my friends. - I hope I didn't disturb you.
No..no..
I wasn't doing anything special. - Adi?
Adi..
One second. - Actually, I want to talk to you.
So come see me.
Yes, of course.
I'll come right away. - Good.
Okay, sir.
Tell me..what fate wants.
Okay, sir.
Anushka!
Anushka!
Anushka!
The fake assurances..make me cry.
Hi.
What's this punishment..O Lord.
Champagne?
Tell me..what fate wants.
It's over.
I finished it while waiting for you.
I made you wait really long. - Not really.
Anushka, I won't ask you why you took so long to come.
Or what's been troubling you.
Because I know.
Anushka, when we love someone..
..it's really difficult to hide.
And the problem is..
..neither can you hide it, nor can I.
What do you mean, Jay?
I've lived you.
I have..lived you.
I love with all my heart, and..
Happiness came to me..with its back turned towards me.
As I shook hands, it started crying.
All my support..are helpless.
What was my mistake, O Lord?
Tell me..what fate wants.
Whiskey? - No, sir.
Sir?
How long will you keep calling me sir?
Get used to calling me dad.
Yes..Dad.
Did you call me for something important?
You see..we'll soon be related for life.
I know a lot about you, but..
..I want you to know few things about me.
Look, son..I achieved everything in life.
Everything.
But there's just one thing I regret.
Amrita and I couldn't give her the love she deserved.
I realize my mistake.
And so..the goal of my life is Riya and her happiness.
And her happiness..is you.
She thinks..you'll love her all her life and keep her happy.
You do love her, but I've noticed..
..that you love your friends little too much.
I..didn't understand.
Adi..
I want you to give Riya so much love..
..that she forgets her past.
Yeah.. - And Riya gives you so much love..
..that you forget your friends.
I hope you understand what I'm saying?
Yes, I do..
Good..I knew you would understand.
Anushka!
Anushka, what's wrong?
Dear, open the door.
Anushka!
Tell us what's wrong.
Anushka, for my sake.
Come out. - Open the door.
Open the door, dear. - Don't do this, dear.
Open the door, dear.
Anushka, for my sake.
Come out, come out, dear.
Open the door, dear.
Anushka. Come out, quickly.
Anushka.
What's wrong?
Be honest, dear. What's wrong?
The truth is..I'm getting married tomorrow..to Jay.
Yes.
Yes, dear.
Don't cry.
I know..
The truth is..you love Adi. Right?
What's the point, Gulabo?
That's not it, dear.
I know.. Adi loves you.
It's not too late, dear.
Go and tell him.. - What's the point, Gulabo?
He should say something too.
Don't worry, dear.
You will get what you're destined for.
Don't cry dear.
Where are you headed now?
It's almost evening.
I've lost the address..
Everything I wrote down, was erased.
Adi.
Where were you? I was looking all over for you.
Why? What happened?
You're still awake. - No. I am scared.
Feels like something is not right.
You look.. - Me?
What, Riya?
Just tell me that what I'm thinking is wrong.
Just tell me it's my imagination.
Just tell me it'll all be fine, Adi.
Just..just tell me that you love me.
Just that..
Please.. - Adi, tell me.
Adi. - Please calm down.
I am sorry. I am really sorry, Riya.
I am tired.
Go get some sleep.
I need some rest.
Good night.
Excuse me. - Yes, ma'am.
I said satin curtains in this section.
These are not satin.
Okay, rosewater, welcome drink and..
And these flowers? - Ma'am, you said white flowers.
I said white orchids.
Riya. - What?
What are you doing?
Forget all this, and get ready.
How can I?
I specifically said I don't want florescent color.
I just want soothing colors. - That's okay.
Relax, dear. It will all be fine.
When will it be fine, dad? After my marriage.
Everything's wrong here.
Everything's wrong in my marriage.
Dad, everything is going wrong in my marriage.
Nothing, nothing, nothing will go wrong in your marriage.
I am right here.
Look at me. Nothing will go wrong.
I will make sure everything goes right.
Oh my..what kind of a place is this?
You can't find a single thing.
Back in India, you make one call..
..and the shopkeeper delivers the goods to your doorstep.
Here's the telephone.
Call room service and tell them what to get.
I see..I can't find the drawstring of your pajamas.
Call room service and ask them to get it.
Hello, drawstring..
You don't get drawstrings here.
Exactly, I can't find anything.
And since the time you got here, you've been behaving like a tourist.
As if only my son's getting married.
And son..
Why are you so upset?
It's not good.
Now go get ready quickly.
You.. - And listen.
Listen..
The list which the priest gave us also has betel leaves.
They should be here by the nuptial rounds.
Oh Lord..what is this you gave me?
I can't believe this is the same woman I married.
If I am lying for a minute, it makes her mad.
Crazy woman.
What are you up to?
Adi..
Don't think I don't know what's going on in your life.
I know it all.
I am your father.
Seriousness doesn't look good on my face.
But all I would say..
..do what your heart says.
My son.
There's no place for dreams in reality, Anushka.
Get ready quickly.
Jay's waiting for you.
Just excuse us, please.
I'll be right back, Anushka.
Anushka, I invited you and your family over..
..and gave them a lot of respect.
Would you agree?
Yeah!
So isn't it your duty to..
..to think about Adi and my family's respect?
Uncle, I didn't understand.
What are you trying to say?
Alright. I'll be direct.
Adi isn't just getting Riya's love from this marriage.
He's getting a opportunity to fulfill all the dreams that he saw.
I know.
Who would know about Adi's dreams better than me?
But you don't know that..
..there's a thin line between friendship and love.
And it's hard to say when you cross it.
The friendship that you and Adi share..
..keep it till that.
You got that?
Because only Riya has a right to Adi's love.
And love is for the one that has the right to it.
I hope I've made myself..amply clear.
Yes.
Yes.
Uncle, you made everything very clear.
You are right.
And love is for the one that has the right to it.
Yes.
Good!
I said I'm not in the mood to talk.
By the time you're in the mood to talk..
..it will be worthless.
Why are you yelling? - So that I knock some sense in you.
Forget it, Petha.
He can't see what everyone can.
So how can he hear your voice?
Have you two lost your mind?
Stop yelling at me and go get booze. - Booze?
Should we drink on the occasion of your marriage..
..or to drown your sorrows?
Mind your tongue. You're talking about my marriage.
You're not the only one getting married.
Anushka's getting married too.
And whether you think about her or not, but we do.
What do you mean by I don't think about her?
You do?
Then go tell Riya that you don't love her.
You love Anushka. Tell her.
Forget it, Petha. It's not his cup of tea,
He's a coward.
Who are you to tell me?
It's my life. - Leave.
No! It's not just your life.
Leave him. - Understood.
You're ruining Anushka, Riya as well as Jay's life too.
Seems like you love your bike more than their lives.
Leave him.
There's no point talking to him.
Let's go. Come on.
You do what you want. Come on.
Take the bride's hand in yours.
I am in love..what to do?
Sprinkle water.
I am in love..what to do?
I am in love..what to do?
Now pour clarified butter in the fire.
I can't live..or die.
Adi. - Yeah.
The priest is asking us to pour clarified butter in the fire. - Yes.
I am in love..what to do?
I am in love..what to do?
Adi, where are you lost?
Petha, Nikki, Batli..I don't see anyone.
Adi, we're getting married.
And you're still thinking about your friends.
Where are granny and Gulabo?
Adi?
Adi?
Where is everyone?
Petha, where's Anushka?
Where's Anushka?
She left.
She went back to London.
Adi, we're getting married.
You're still thinking about Anushka.
Anushka's gone. - Yes, she left.
Because she can't watch you marrying me.
She loves you. - I love her too!
Move aside.
I love her.
How dare you?
Hold on!
Mr. Kumar, we can retaliate with violence as well.
But we can't solve this problem with hitting each other.
Because this matter concerns the heart..
..and I think it's beyond your understanding.
Let him hit me, papa.
But even though you hit me..
..I will be honest with you.
The truth..that took me really long to understand.
That I love Anushka.
Why you.. - Papa, please!
What?
Even I realized this truth.
My heart knew that he loved Anushka.
But maybe I took too long to realize this truth.
But how the hell can he do this?
You once said..
Even if you stop holding hands, relationships don't break.
Pardon me, Mr. Kumar.
I know this is your personal matter.
But when few lives are at the stake of ruination..
..then I can't keep quiet.
What do you want to say?
Just think, sir.
When will your daughter be happier?
If Adi doesn't marry Riya..
..or if Adi marries Riya, but keeps loving Anushka in his heart?
Everyone falls in love, Mr. Kumar.
But only a few have the courage to get their love.
Today Adi told the truth in front of everyone.
But somewhere everyone's betterment lies in his truth.
The rest is up to you to decide, sir.
Mr. Kapoor is right, papa.
Even if you get me married to Adi.
He won't be happy neither will I.
Because he loves Anushka.
I am really sorry, Riya.
Thank you, sir.
Anushka!
Anushka!
Adi! Adi!
Anushka!
I am still wondering..what just happened.
Everything feels new.
O beloved..
How? How can you leave me?
What else could I do, Adi?
Throw flowers at your marriage with Riya?
I thought you left me.
I almost died.
I love you, Adi.
I love you more.
O beloved..what is this condition?
Feels like love.
What have you done to me?
You knew that I would come.
Yes, I did.
Me too.
Jay. I am sorry, buddy.
There's no justification for love.
Love is just..love.
Thanks, Jay.
And by the way, I've booked your honeymoon tickets.
Adi..don't you think..
..we should get married before the honeymoon.
Yes!
Lambu, come down.
Come down.
Decorate the venue. Eat some sweets.
Shake a leg with the guests.
Anushka's married, now I can drink in peace.
Invite all your guests.
That Luv Kapoor's looking so hot.
I am looking hot.
The Wedding Pulav.
The Wedding Pulav.
Come on, kiss..
Lambu, kiss him.
Come on.
Come on. - What is she doing?
What are you doing? Come on.
Hurry up.
Sweety. - Yeah.
The son's going for his honeymoon. - Yes.
What about the father?
You are just. - What?
Too much. - What?
Forget it. - Why?
Carry on then. - I am.
I am not doing it to you.
Did you two break up?
No, she said yes.
Play this song again.
Thanks, Jay.
This love story wouldn't be complete without you.
It's not complete yet.
This is just the beginning.
Aren't you a bit overdressed?
Of course.
It's my could-be would-be husband's wedding after all.
We're together!
Selfie!
Decorate the palanquin..and the horse.
Play the music out loud.
Get a picture taken with the bride-groom.
Raise the volume..and make everyone sway.
Play this song again.

The film centers around the life of Taran (Neha Sharma), who loses her fiancé Amar (Aashim Gulati) in a skiing accident. Her life changes when she meets Shekhar Malhotra (Aditya Seal), whom she initially sees as a good friend but soon develops feelings for. Eventually, she shares a kiss with Shekhar, marking the start of her process of moving on with her life.

The plot takes a sudden twist when it is revealed that Amar has survived the accident and has been in a coma as an unidentified patient for the last eight months. He returns home after regaining consciousness. On learning of Amar's return, Shekhar decides to distance himself from Taran and her family. Eventually, Taran realizes that she continues to have feelings for Shekhar and tells Amar about what happened when he was away. Together they decide to break up and stay close friends. Taran goes back to dating Shekhar. What Amar does not tell Taran is that he is only pretending to be okay with the breakup. In reality, he is miserable without her. In the meantime, Shekhar starts to notice that though Taran is dating him, she too misses Amar. When he speaks to Taran about this, she confesses to having chosen him over Amar because ""it was the right thing to do,"" especially after all Shekhar had done for her in Amar's absence. Once, when Taran runs off to help Amar, Shekhar gets very upset and refuses to speak to Taran for a number of days. Eventually, he calls Taran to inform her that he's leaving the country.

The plot takes another twist when, trying to find Shekhar, Taran, accompanied by Amar, and his father (Kanwaljit Singh) discover that Shekhar was responsible for Amar's accident. In a further twist, Amar's father confesses that he knew this all along. He also tells of Shekhar coming to him seeking forgiveness for the accident. And how he not only forgave Shekhar but also started seeing him as a son. He also confesses to having intentionally introduced Shekhar to Taran and her family in the hope of helping Taran overcome her grief.

On learning all of this, Taran, along with Amar and his father, hurry to the airport, where they spot Shekhar about to board a plane. Eventually, Shekhar prevails over Taran, explaining that dating him because ""it was the right thing to do"" is not enough and she should be with the one she loves the most. He eventually hugs both Taran and Amar and departs tearfully.

Nope!
Our resort is on that mountain.
I'll be going further ahead to ski.
Higher up.

Yes, dad?
Has Amar returned?
No, dad.
The weather's getting worse too.
I'm his father.
I've put up with his
habits since he was a kid.
Now it's your turn.
I'm a little scared now, dad.
I'll call you later.
Ok.
It's just a stupid mountain.
Why can't they find him?
Though he doesn't say it,
but dad's worried too.
Taran, don't worry.
It's Amar after all.
You know him, nah!
He may come late,
but he'll definitely come.
Papa..
No need to worry, Manpreet.
He will come back.
Where else will he go?
Yeah, of course. Where can he go?
I am going only because
Taran's all alone out there.
- See you.
- Ok, call me.
Yes. I will.
Ok. Bye.

When you feel like crying,
cry out loud.
And when you feel love, give a hug.
These are the only
two realities of life.
Years later..
..I went to office today.
Got some work done too.
In the beginning, when I started the
gallery there were many instances..
..when I thought I might
have to shut down the gallery.
Thank you, papa.
Like it often happens in any business.
But it's been 30 years now.
The gallery is still up and running.
Nothing stops..
..if it's done with a good intention.
That's enough, thank you.
How is it?
Delicious, like always.
For 6 months, I sat
alone in this house..
..and thought about Amar.
Sometimes I would cry.
As a kid,
when he was just learning to walk..
..he would often fall down,
like all kids do.
I would rush to pick him up,
as if I had hurt myself.
And Urvashi would laugh at me.
She would say, 'let him fall'.
'He'll learn to walk..
..and to deal with his pain.'
I would often quarrel with her.
Saying..
'We can at least
save him some of the pain'.
But she was very sensible.
Do you know what she would say?
'Every life has its
own share of pain.'
'The sooner you learn to conquer it,
the better.'
'How long do you
think you can help him?'
She was right.
For three months, she battled
with her pain in the hospital.
I couldn't save her from her pain.
And I couldn't save
Amar from his pain either.
Anyway..
..he must have dealt with his pain.
We need to deal with
our pain too, dear.
I've thought of something, dear.
Look dear..
..we can either keep crying
for years to come and wait for him.
Weave thousands of stories,
saying, 'maybe this..or maybe that'.
Or we can admit the truth.
Admit the truth, dear.
I've already given
up all hope regarding Amar.
That's what I called
to tell you, dear.
And I wanted to request
you personally, dear..
..that let us together, let Amar go.
Let him go.
He was supposed to be
with us for only this long.
Hi, dad.
Come, son.
I thought I'll take you out.
Come, dear.
This is Taran.
Shekhar.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'll take your leave now, father.
You didn't bring your car.
Shall I call a cab?
No, papa. I brought my cycle.
Can I drop you?
No thank you.
I'll really be fine, papa.
Okay.
See you, papa.
- Bye.
- Bye.

to have vanished in thin air..""

Enough, Gurpreet.
No girl from our family
is going to Pakistan.
Who's going to Pakistan?
He lives right here in Edinburgh.
But he's a Pakistani after all.
But I like him.
You even liked that stupid guy.
- What was his name, Taran?
- Randy.
Enough, whether he's
Pakistani or Afganistani.
You won't find someone like him.
You should be worrying about
yourself, I've plenty of options.
I see..
Then what about him?
He's too cute.
By the way, my guy isn't just cute.
He's good looking too.
I said no means no. Twisty.
Don't call me Twisty.
You're always hitting me.
Twisty. Let's see you escape today.
Take that. And that.
Move.. Move..
Take that.
Twisty! Twisty!
- Hi, papa.
- Hello, papa!
Hi.
This is how life should be..happy.
- Hello, papa.
- Hello, dear.
I am sorry, but I brought
a guest along uninformed.
He's the son of my friend.
His father passed away.
Since then he's been lonely,
always wandering around.
- How are you, dear?
- Fine.
Come, Shekhar.
Hi!
Meet the charming Kaurs.
Manpreet, the eldest of the lot.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Gurpreet.
- Hi.
- Taran.
- Taran, of course.
Hi, Taran.
- You've met her.
- Yes.
And this is Navjot.
For the past three
years, he's convinced..
..that he'll marry Manpreet.
It was Manpreet's birthday yesterday.
But we've been invited
to dinner today.
I see..
- Wish you a belated happy birthday.
- Thank you.
Sorry, I didn't know.
I showed up empty-handed.
I owe you a gift.
Not at all, please.
Have a seat.
Take a seat everyone.
I'll finish up first
and then we can chat.
Yeah..
I've already finished my chores.
I'll be done with mine in 10 minutes.
Navjot and Taran,
you guys go get the cake.
Let me first pour papa a drink.
Then we can go.
Can I go get the cake?
And you guys can finish up by then.
Actually, I'll come along too.
These guys are such drama-queens.
They're very choosy about the flavour.
No-no..what are you saying, Gurpreet?
How can our guest go get the cake?
A guest should get a gift too.
- Come, Gurpreet.
- No-no, I am pretty much done here.
I'll go get it.
I haven't done any cycling today,
I'll go get it.
I'll order one.
This way we'll have five cakes.
Actually, I can bake
a cake in 15 minutes.
That way we'll all stay at home
we'll have the cake..
..and it'll be my gift to you.
Ohh, so sweet.
But please,
no need for such formalities.
I am going to invade your kitchen.
And you're speaking about formality.
Well I'll need an assistant.
Gurpreet, would you mind helping me?
Sure.
The blender's here, fantastic.
Gurpreet,
chop these fruits please.
Sure.
Manpreet, can you pass me that bowl?
Thank you.
I also need some flour
and some baking powder.
- Sure.
- Thank you.
By the way..
..I've an old association
with the name Gurpreet.
Meaning?
My best friend when
I was a kid.. was Gurpreet.
We would call him Guru.
He went to India.
Later, on my first trip to New York..
..the name of my first
taxi driver was Gurpreet.
And you won't believe this.
When I was returning from New York..
..my taxi-driver to the airport,
was another Gurpreet.
And just see this..
There are seven Gurpreets
in my phone diary.
Seven.
My last girlfriend's dad..
Sardar Gurpreet Singh Dhillon.
Thank God for him.
If it wasn't for him..
..I would've been married by now.
But it's unbelievable.
All seven Gurpreets were men.
Oh really!
Until 10 minutes ago, I thought
only guys name can be Gurpreet.
Here are your fruits and your knife.
Make it yourself.
- I haven't finished yet.
- What?
After meeting you today, I felt..
Only girls should be called Gurpreet.
Whatever.
- Thank you.
- Take some more.
Thank you, sir.
- Manpreet, the food is fabulous.
- Thank you.
You should taste Manpreet's
kidney-beans and rice.
- It's out of this world.
- Is it?
So Shekhar.
- Yeah.
- How long do you plan to stay here?
Don't know.
Honestly, I don't know.
And anyway I believe,
we never decide the time.
Life does.
We just pretend.
One day, papa passed away suddenly.
He wasn't that old or sick.
One day he was leaving for office..
I was having my breakfast.
He turned around and said bye.
I saw..
..something unusual.
But before I could ask.. he..
..just collapsed.
We had..
..so many plans together.
Some for the next vacation,
some for 20 years later.
Later, I decided
I won't plan anything.
Just take life as it comes.
I see life..differently.
Remember how your cousins would
come home during summer vacations.
We would make plans at night.
We would plan 14 days
of fun in just 7 days.
We'll do this..we'll do that.
And then one day..vacations
would get over.
Everyone would go back to their homes.
That's how life is..
Ends suddenly..like summer vacations.
We make plans for many
lifetimes in one lifetime.
And then cry over
things we couldn't do.
I still do things that papa liked.
He's always around me.
Sometimes as papa,
sometimes as Gurpreet.
Sometimes he's
warm..sometimes furious.
And sometimes..
..he just watches me sleep all night.
I never stop myself.
I just embrace happiness
wherever I get it.
Because who knows..
..when the vacations might end.
You're absolutely right.
Nice thought.
'Life is a summer vacation.'
Here! Your cake's ready.
Let's see this.
We'll know when we see it.
Bravo.
- Let me help you.
- Yes.
- Facing down?
- Yes.
We'll soon find out.
Happy birthday, Manpreet.
- Thank you so much.
- Happy birthday.
Make a wish.
Okay.
""Happy birthday to you.""
""Happy birthday to you.""
""Happy birthday dear Manpreet.""
""Happy birthday to you.""
Thank you.
Not bad.
Taran, I think you've found
the consultant for your patisserie.
- Seriously, it's really nice.
- Thank you.
Taran and I,
we're starting a patisserie.
You will be our consultant.
No-no, very bad choice.
Why?
I only know
how to make few things.
But a very dear friend of my,
François.
He runs the best patisserie in London.
Come along,
and I'll introduce you to him.
And he'll give you the best advice,
and that's for sure.
""O beloved..""
""Life has offers both
happiness and cure. ""
""What do I do..
my heart grieves for you.""
""As if, every breath of
mine chants your name.""
""As if, every breath of mine
chants your name.""
Taran, it was a pleasure meeting you.
Be ready, and I'll see you at 10.
Sure.
Manpreet, can I give you a hug please.
Of course.
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.
- Keep coming as long as you're here.
- I will.
Shekhar.
Shekhar.
God..
Hi. Good morning.
I've been calling you for so long.
I thought I'll turn
around when the song's over.
Very funny.
It was hard to notice the headphones.
You're up early.
- We didn't sleep all night.
- I see.
The three of us were
chatting all night.
And brother Navjot.
He doesn't live with us.
He just comes over sometimes.
His father is quiet old.
So he feels lonely.
- That's sweet of him.
- Yeah, he's really sweet.
Coffee?
Okay.
Come.
She thought she loved me.
But she didn't?
- No, she did.
- Then?
- Then she found it.
- Who?
- What she always wanted.
- Then who were you?
She just loved me.
That's esoteric.
It's practical.
- Sugar?
- No.
Between our desires
and our choices in life..
..lies our weakness.. ..or our strength.
That's even more esoteric.
And now?
No love or anything
of that sort until 2019.
Just free as a bird.
Why 2019?
Just like that.
- Hi. Morning.
- Hi.
Wow. So you'll open the
door and all for me, huh?
That's my dad.
He would teach me about chivalry
and respecting women since I was nine.
And he even managed to
imbibe some of the habits in me.
Shall we get something
for you for the road?
Some coffee/sandwiches.
It's a long drive.
No-no, I am good.
By the way, what do you do?
I mean..what do you want to do?
Me..I travel.
Meet people.. see new places..
But, mostly alone.
I mean professionally, what do you..
Professionally.. sorry..
You see Taran, about 6
years ago I had a Chinese friend.
Zhi.
He had a financial mind..and
I was the software kind.
So together we designed an app.
We had a small office, in a garage.
Just the two of us.
Soon it grew bigger..
We had around 20-25
people working for us.
I always thought we can work
harder and expand the company.
But one day Zhi..made
a deal on the company.
The money offered was huge,
so we thought..
Doesn't matter how much
money you were offered..
- ..you worked hard to build that company..
- 62 million Dollars.
We each got 30-30.
- 62 million Dollars?
- Yeah.
Then why work?
Exactly.
But no..I wanted to work.
But Zhi said let's
take a break for few years.
And we'll start something new in 2019.
What is so special about 2019?
I guess Gurpreet's told you a lot.
Why did you love Amar?
- What do you mean?
- I mean..
I want to know why someone
loves a person so much.
I don't know.
You know..like he was a part of me.
A part of my body.. part of my soul.
If I can separate him from myself..
..then maybe I can
think why I loved him?
I guess..love isn't reasonable.
It's beyond reason.
Beautiful.
Listen to me, right.
Shekhar, oh my God!
Come here you..
And this beautiful lady, Taron..
- Taran.
- Taran.
Come here. Come here.
So this is my boyfriend, Daniel.
- Nice to meet you.
- I know, right.
You know, I used to have
a crush on him back in college.
But he's so grossly heterosexual.
And boring. So..
You show him the cakes.
Only the cakes.
And you and I Taran,
we're going to have a chat. Okay.
- Yeah.
- Come on.
- Okay.
- So, what are we trying today?
Francoise says you might
like some of the carrot cake.
I was going to cut you a slice,
if that's okay.
- Please do that.
- Okay.
Try..
Good choice, no?
So darling, you want to open up
a pattisserie, don't you?
This is a very, very, very hard..
I never, never helped anyone.
Because nobody helped me, so I
don't do this. But he vouched for you.
So I..
I will help you.
- And that is..
- So..set!
I will help you..
..but you've to do it together.
And you've to do it
with your heart, okay?
- Yes, I will.
- Okay.
So, you let me know
if you change your mind.
I will let you know
if I change my mind.
Liar.
Bye.
Bye, I'll see you.
- Bye Daniel, I'll see you.
- Bye.
I feel like taking to
the skies and tell everyone.
You see Taran, the time that
will take us to get to the airport..
Amar!
I was happy.
Maybe I would've told him first,
if he was alive.
The first person you
think of in a happy moment..
..is the most valuable
person in their life.
You know..
Most people turn their back on life.
Actually..we're used
to carrying our past.
And no matter how many
options life sends our way..
..we don't see them.
There can never be an option
for someone we love, Shekhar.
Of course not.
How can there be an option for humans?
Then?
What do you want from life?
Just a little happiness.
And for some reason,
even you don't know..
..that you were
happy with Amar, right.
But Amar isn't here anymore.
So what now?
Maybe not Amar, but you can
surely search for happiness.
You just..need to look ahead.
Happiness is right in front of you.
Go get your share of happiness
through your options.
What options?
I don't know.
Only you can see your options.
Maybe that lamp-post.
What about that lamp-post?
Maybe you'll find happiness
by just leaning on it.
Or maybe that..musician's music.
Or a cup of coffee
or a glass of champagne.
I don't know.
Taran..
..every minute.. a moment is
passing-by right now too..
All you need to do is..make
every passing moment happy.
And you decide what makes you happy.
That lamp-post, or that music or..
..coffee,
or the champagne or something else.
It's your life, your moments,
your happiness.
And so are the choices.

You were right!
You were right!
Life should be like
this road, straight-ahead!
Life should rush into your lungs,
like this weather.
Life should get entangled
in your curls, like this wind!
Are you okay?
Shekhar didn't know and..
..she gulped it down
like a professional.
She is asleep anyway.
You can overact when she wakes up.
Don't worry Manpreet, she is fine.
She was quite happy,
and this happened.
It's a good thing that she was happy.
Thanks.
See you.
Hey, Gurpreet.
I need to meet you, urgently.
Okay.. is everything okay?
No-No-No!
This is a very serious matter.
After all he is Gurpreet's boyfriend.
He's invited us to dinner.
And Manpreet's refusing to go.
Now that will be very
embarrassing for her.
She hasn't even met him yet.
You mean she rejected
him without even meeting?
Exactly.
Just because he's a Pakistani.
- So what if he's a Pakistani.
- Exactly.
They should meet once.
I can understand if
she rejects him later.
But she will never meet him!
You know how.. how stubborn she is!
Look, dear. I can talk
to her and she might even go.
But I can't guarantee you
what she will do when she gets there.
Let's take it one by one.
First we must get her to go there.
Well.. let's call her.
Why aren't you answering the phone?
Taran!
Must be papa..calling for you.
He always calls on the landline,
for you.
Yes, dear. How are you?
Hello, papa.
I am not fine.
You already know about Taran.
And that Gurpreet's
acting like a real 'twisty'.
Yeah dear, she did call.
Poor girl was crying a lot.
But we can't exactly
tie her to a pole.
How is it 'tying her to a pole'?
What are you saying?
The boy's a Pakistani.
You know the situation.
What situation, dear?
The kind that Pakistanis have.
Blasts here.. explosions there!
Dear, we'll consider
all that when we talk to them.
But I feel we should meet them once.
I talked to Shekhar as well.
He has the same opinion.
Anyone will have the same opinion.
You're too naïve,
you don't know anything.
There's no point in going
to any Pakistani's home.
Out of the question.
Talk to him, dear.
And I'll do as you two say.
- No.
- And..
Talk to her.
She should feel that
someone's on her side.
If we try to corner her,
she will never agree.
Talk to her.
Yes, Manpreet.
What do you say, Shekhar?
Well..a Pakistani guy
is out of the question.
What?
Isn't it?
Yes.
And anyway,
there are no boys in Pakistan.
What?
Why? Are there no boys in Pakistan?
Well, half of them
are busy playing cricket..
..and the rest are unpredictable.
But there must be some guys.
Yeah..there must be a couple of them.
We'll come along to
see the guy if you say so..
..but our lives could
be at stake in Pakistan.
No Shekhar,
he lives right here..in Edinburgh.
I see.. so he moved here!
I am telling you very
clever these people are.
No he didn't move here,
he was born here.
But Manpreet, we must check whether
he's got a local passport or of Pakistan.
What difference does that make?
Even we have a local passport.
Unbelievable.
Well, that's true.
Passport doesn't matter.
He should be a nice
guy..and keep our girl happy.
But..what do we do about Pakistan?
I don't know..Gurpreet
likes him a lot.
But my heart doesn't agree at all.
Honestly.
Can I give you an advice?
Meet him.
And what if I like him?
Then don't tell Gurpreet
that you like him.
That's the problem Shekhar,
that's just it.
How will I say no if I like him?
He even has a local passport.
No Manpreet,
I don't trust these Pakistanis.
Who cares about their passport?
I see.
Well..we can at least go meet them.
At least we'll get some good food.
Pakistanis make really good food.
Yes..I think that sounds logical.
Let's go meet them,
we'll get to eat some good food too.
It's been so long I
haven't seen a Pakistani.
They are very handsome.
But remember Manpreet..
..we've to say no.
Of course we do.
But there's no harm in seeing one.
Come, dear.
The house looks okay.
- How are you?
- Fine.
- Hello.
- Hello. Please..come in.
Come, dear.
Your house is really beautiful,
Inshallah.
That's Mashallah.
Mashallah?
Isn't Inshallah and
Mashallah the same?
Not at all.
Inshallah is when you
want to say 'God Willing'.
Like 'You will like my
house 'Inshallah' (God Willing).
And Mashallah when you want
to say 'save you from evil eye'.
Like 'You're looking so beautiful
'Mashallah'.
Please come in.
I'll call my mother..
Your mother's still alive?
Of course..may God bless
her with a long life.
Mashallah! Mashallah!
My house looks lively again.
Otherwise he's always
busy-busy and more busy.
After meeting Gurpreet
I had some hope.
- Your sister is really amazing.
- That she is.
- Come, I'll show you around the house.
- You take a seat, mom.
I'll show them around.
Do you know the way around the house?
- You're mostly at the hospital.
- Hospital? Why?
I am a doctor, Manpreet.
- Come, we'll show you around.
- Yes.
- This is our drawing room.
- I see.
That's the kitchen.
We'll show you upstairs later.
This is the guest room.
And this is..
..our temple.
- Temple?
- Yes.
But Gurpreet said you're Pakistani.
We are Pakistanis.
Do you have any objection?
Of course not.
We don't if you don't.
But doesn't your
family have a problem.
Being a Pakistani,
you pray like Indians.
Manpreet dear, we're all Hindus.
But you're Pakistani.
There are Hindus even in Pakistan.
Just like there are Muslims in India.
- Please come..
- Thank you.
Gurpreet,
couldn't you tell me this before?
You never let me say
anything beyond Pakistan.
I get it, there's a little confusion.
Why do you wear a sherwani,
and not pant and shirt?
I always wear a pant and shirt.
But I thought of wearing
this today so I could impress you.
Too much confusion!
There's a different between
religion and culture.
We're Hindu by religion..and
our culture is Pakistani.
And we're proud of our culture.
See..
Such a simple theory,
made so complicated by the world!
Things are always simple..
..but when you don't understand,
it gets complicated.
- Yes.
- Leave it.
I'll serve dinner.
I hope no one's vegetarian.
Wait a minute.
There's another surprise
in store after dinner.
- Harry sings really well.
- I see.
And so does mom.
So how about you sing
a song today for me.
""The moon's very proud..
""..about its moonlight.""
""He hasn't met you yet,
hence the arrogance.""
""Is there a secret in your heart..""
""..or are you high on love?""
""There's definitely
a reason for such praises.""
""The crazy heart..""
""The crazy heart..""
""My beloved's come home today.""
""My heart's really elated.""
""As I caught a glimpse of
my handsome beloved.""
""My eyes feel bewitched.""
""My eyes feel bewitched.""
I am sorry we didn't
get a chance to talk.
I just wanted to say I am
so sorry I got so drunk that day.
You were happy, weren't you?
A lot.
Nice people.
Yes. Very nice.
They will keep Gurpreet happy.
- Can I say something?
- No.
Shut up.
You know, Shekhar's plans
for 2019 will soon get cancelled.
He's always looking
at Taran so secretly.
- He thinks we don't know.
- That's true.
But she's no less either.
She was whispering
to him on the terrace.
I wasn't whispering, only apologizing.
Oh my..apology.
You never apologized to us.
Go back to sleep,
it's not morning yet.
Someone's calling.
What are you doing?
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
- Let me guess..Francois called.
- Yes.
The bank's sent a mail,
he's leaving from London.
He wanted to start work today itself.
- Alright, sounds good.
- I thought we could have coffee together.
I wanted to tell you first.
Nice house.
It's a mess, I like it like that.
Thanks.
For what?
A lot.
Not at all.
Francois is a dear friend.
We wouldn't have to go at all.
I could've called him
instead and he would've come.
But I thought you'll
get out of the house..
..see few things, think over things.
Yes, thanks for that.
Not for Francois.
I mean for that too..
But mostly..for all the
concern you've shown for me.
You've done so much.
You told me so many
things..about happiness.
About finding happiness.
Thanks.
See you.. I must go get ready.
I would really like it..if
you stay around me for this project.
Be with me.
See you, bye.
Taran!
Wait a minute.
When Zhi and I started our company..
..I used to wear this watch.
This watch changed my time.
I want you to have it.
Why are you doing all this for me?
I don't know.
I don't..
""Blessed love..!""
""Blessed love..!""
""Blessed love..!""
""I'm drenched by your shower of love.""
""Your breath makes me soar high.""
""The world shifted beneath my feet.""
""This never happened before.""
""Congratulations,
dear heart, this is love!""
""Congratulations,
dear heart, this is love!""
""Blessed love..!""
""Blessed love..!""
""Blessed love..!""
""Blessed love..!""
""Why does it feel like..""
""..your gaze lingers in my eyes!""
""Expressing things
that I never knew of.""
""You are everywhere I see..""
""..then how can I go away from you?""
""Congratulations,
dear heart, this is love!""
""Congratulations,
dear heart, this is love!""
""I still stand where I met you first.""
""Your heart is the city,
from which I never returned.""
""I'm lost somewhere, do let
me know if you happen to find me.""
""Congratulations,
dear heart, this is love!""
""Congratulations,
dear heart, this is love!""
""Blessed love..!""
""Blessed love..!""
""Blessed love..!""
""Blessed love..!""
""Blessed love..!""
What happened?
Nothing.
Taran, something's wrong.
It's not like I don't miss him.
You know, some nights..
..I feel like I am plunging
thousands of feet below.
And I wake up suddenly.
What's wrong, Shekhar?
Shekhar?
What's wrong, Shekhar?
Whenever you're scared
of anything in life..
..then you must face it.
Fear is a coward.
If you stare directly in its eye,
it runs away.
You know, people have woken
up from coma even after 10 years.
Sometimes they lose their
memory..or something else.
Amar will be fine, so papa was saying.
And that French doctor
doesn't speak English.
But she was saying that he's fine.
But didn't papa talk to Amar as well?
- Yes, they spoke briefly.
- Yes.
Did papa leave from home?
He sounded okay on the phone.
He was saying he often
forgets few things.
But it all comes
back if you remind him.
I hope he's fine.
He will be absolutely fine, papa.
You know, sometimes
when you wake up from a nap..
..you often forget things.
And poor guy was in coma for 8 months.
But don't worry.
He'll be fine.
God bless that doctor.
She was saying.. someone
found him in a small river.
They kept treating him for 8 months.
How are you, papa?
Where is Taran?
Amar.
This is the fourth time
we crossed this statue.
Being a drifter has its own perks.
Being a drifter has
its own benefits too.
If you pass-by the same road..
..you often notice new things.
- Doctor, do you drink?
- Of course.
The martyrdom of the grapes
should never be in vain.
This is important.
""Mix some love with alcohol.""
- No-no-no..
- Why?
- Go on, and take him too.
- Dance..
Papa..take papa along.
- Go-go-go.
- What will I do?
There-there-there.
Guys.. I am absolutely fine.
- And papa..
- Yes.
Don't worry at all.
From tomorrow I will resume office,
I promise.
No need to go to the office.
Do you know the state we were in?
Please sit next to me for a while.
I'll obey all your orders.
Do exactly as you say.
And I promise, I will get well soon.
Absolutely fit, like before.
Cheers to Amar's return!
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Cheers!
Come.
You're really late today.
It's time you hit the bed.
Manpreet and everybody
are waiting downstairs.
Amar.
Amar.
You need to sleep.
But you look so beautiful.
Get changed, get into bed and call me.
Manpreet and everyone are waiting.
What?
Fine.
Hi.
You didn't show up?
You know what,
just as you guys left..
..I ran into an old friend.
He said let's have some
coffee and ordered beer.
Then we just went on.
I am so happy for you.
For everyone actually.
Are you driving?
Yes. Why?
Nothing.. just go home.
Of course.
You take care. I'll see you soon.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Go on..go on.
- Okay?
- Yeah..alright.
- Yes-yes-yes..
- Good morning, Shekhar!
- Hi, good morning.
Good morning.
It's okay, I've got it..
You guys are so early today.
- Could've shown up a little later.
- Yeah.
Actually, we went out for breakfast.
Pete's.
We go there every
Saturday for breakfast.
It's about an hour
and a half from here.
They sell the best pancakes
in the world.
Sure.
Amar really wanted to go
there..so we left as early as 7am.
- Daniel, Françoise..pancakes.
- Coming.
Come fast.
- You know Jasleen..
- Who?
The girl beating the drums
at the airport.
Oh yes, right.
She is throwing a party today.
She has invited you as
well as Francoise and Daniel.
Listen guys, you guys have to come.
All of you.
Okay.
Sounds nice, but I hardly know her.
- You know..doesn't make sense.
- What? No, please.
Come on, it will be so much fun.
- Please-please-please.
- Okay.
Thanks.
Well, we've to get ready,
so we're leaving.
Guys, see you at 12..sharp.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye..
You won't come, will you?
No.
I knew you wouldn't come.
That's why I didn't
go with the others.
Why are you complicating life, papa?
Complication is life's problem, son.
Life will decide its course.
But we must give life one
fair chance atleast.. isn't it?
Hello?
Hello!
Yes?
Hello, yes?
Greetings!
""Greetings! How are you?""
""I'm dumbstruck by your looks.""
""I've done the unspeakable.""
""You're dumbstruck by my looks,
you've done the unspeakable.""
""Seeing you groove..""
""Seeing you groove,
I want to get on the floor.""
Yes?
""I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!""
""I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!""
""I wanna dance with you..

""I wanna dance with you..

""I wanna dance with you..

""I wanna dance with you..

""He looks into my eyes when flirting.
Doesn't let any chance pass.""
""My heart skips a beat
when it hears your golden voice.""
""Touches me here and there..
enjoy the feel of it!""
""When I tell him to stop stalking me,
he doesn't relent.""
""I have come only for you,
only for you have I come!""
""I'll walk into these clubs for you.""
""Yes.. yes.. yes!""
""I wanna dance with you..

""I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!""
""I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!""
Gurpreet was saying
you're going somewhere.
Yes.
I was thinking..
to my father's hometown, India.
This watch doesn't suit me anymore.
It's showing me some
very strange times.
What did Shekhar say?
Nothing, that he's happy for me.
Is he leaving?
Yes..he was saying,
that after the opening..
Don't think anything..
..just leave it for a while.
- Hi..
- What are you wearing?
- How is this?
- Black is such a night colour.
This one.
Hey, this one we got
from Switzerland. Remember?
This one fits nicely..and..green..
This white shirt will go with green,
and it also suits you really well.
- I think brown-green-and white.
- Perfect.
What would I have done without you?
Thank God I have you in my life.
What's wrong?
Tired?
No, it's nothing.
You get ready quickly, I've to run.
Two people..without whom
I didn't know where to begin.
Francois and Daniel.
Can I have you guys here please?
And one..
..friend..
Without whom this would've
never been possible.
Shekhar.
Can I have you here please?
I don't want to thank him.
I just want him to stand next to me.
The more you share,
the happier you feel.
So I just want to
say thank you guys..
..for coming here,
to be a part of my happiness.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
""Whom should I anger.. who
should I be upset with?""
""Both are my reflections..""
""..who should I break away from?""
""As if, your eyes ask me something.""
Shekhar, I want you to meet Amar.
- Hi, Amar.
- Hi, Shekhar.
Thank you so much for everything.
Taran can't stop talking about you.
It's great to meet you.
I am so happy for you.
Okay, I need to take Amar home,
with papa.
Because he needs
to turn into bed early.
- Shall we?
- Yeah.
And I'll call you, there's
something we need to talk about.
Sure.
Bye.
See you.
You okay?
Yeah!
Are you sure?
Yeah, I am sure.
Goodnight, Amar.
Be ready on time tomorrow.
We've to visit the temple.
I'll come, pick you up.
Taran..
Congratulations.
Goodnight.
Come here.
Always concerned
about others happiness.
Are you happy?
No, papa.
I am very sad.
A lot.
- A lot, papa.
- No, dear.
Be happy.
You must find your happiness first.
Otherwise how will
you spread happiness?
Even if it means making someone sad.
Do what is right.
Do what you feel is right!
There's nothing more you can do.
Right?
You said 'meet me for breakfast at 9'.
I was there at 9.
But you didn't show up.
I looked around, asked
people if anyone had seen you.
But no one had seen you.
By the time it was
12, I was getting scared.
I asked papa to come down.
You didn't show up all night.
Nor the next day.
The people who were
helping us look for you..
It was clearly evident from
their faces, that we've lost you.
Amar..
..I never even dreamt
about a life without you.
I didn't know what to do.
Then I mustered a lot
of courage and stood up again.
Thinking that I had
to continue without you.
But then suddenly, I
bumped into this fool.
Shekhar.
As soon as I took my eyes off you..
..life swept me off my feet.
Today, I want to confess to you
in His presence, Amar.
No matter how much I love you..
But now there's someone
else in my life.
I am always late, right?
Shekhar.
- Hi!
- Hi!
Buddy, I can never lie.
She knows.
It's not my fault..nor is it yours.
The only difference
is that I was her past..
..and you're her present.
You know, when I woke
up, I didn't know who I was.
I couldn't use my hands or limbs.
For two days they
taught me how to walk.
Later I remembered papa..then Taran.
I vaguely remembered my accident.
Then God.
Anything could've happened.
But no..
I came back.
Papa's absolutely fine, he's happy.
Gurpreet, Taran..they are all fine.
They are all very happy.
But if there's anything
I've lost in this entire incident..
..then that's my right on Taran.
What..
..more can I give you?
Take good care of her, Shekhar.
At least she will still be my friend.
Maybe you can call
me someday to scold me.
See you.
Taran, he's your friend.
You love him.
You've seen many dreams with him.
Waited for him.
Who am I?
Where did I come from?
How long have you known me?
Let me go to hell.
I will fly away again.
Why are you doing this, Taran?
Why?
Don't you always say,
'do the right thing'.
It wasn't your fault.
You just came in our
lives without a reason.
You didn't do anything wrong, Shekhar.
You supported papa. You
did so much for me.
What do I do?
Tell you to leave,
because Amar's back.
Your job's done.
It's his fault.
It's completely his fault.
Where was he?
Where was he for 8 months?
Where was he?
""The night was spent such that..""
""..I couldn't find dawn.""
""As if, the soul
left the body quietly.""
""As if, life moved on fast..
very fast.""
""As if, life moved on fast..
very fast.""
""How do I walk away..""
""..if he lives somewhere in me?""
""I try to walk past
without her noticing..""
""It feels as if..""
""..her gaze quietly follows me.""
- Hi, Shekhar.
- Hi, Amar.
Please..
Shekhar, I am really sorry
that I came here to talk about this.
It was Taran's decision
that she wants to live with you.
And she's my friend,
and I would always want her to be one.
Of course.
Shekhar, Navjot,
Manpreet, Gurpreet, papa..Taran..
..they all love you.
And there must be
a reason why they do.
I am relatively new, and I am sure
I'll start loving you just as much.
But give me some time.
But Shekhar, believe me..
..I'll never do anything
to hurt you or Taran in anyway.
Never.
Yeah, I know that Amar.
I only came here because,
that day Taran told me what she wants.
I thought I should
tell you what I think.
'It wasn't your fault.'
'Don't you always say..
'Do the right thing'.
'Amar.'
'It wasn't your fault.'
'It wasn't your fault.'
- Taran, please..careful.
- Shekhar.. Shekhar..
I am okay.
- Shekhar..
- I am okay.
Doctor.. I love you.
I am okay.
So..goodnight.
Goodnight.
- I'll see you.
- Shekhar!
Nighty-night.
You don't know how
much I love you, Taran.
Hey, good morning.
Good afternoon, really.
- I just woke up.
- I know.
I knew you will call
as soon as you wake up.
You slept well?
Where are you? At home?
Guess where?
Patisserie?
No, I am driving back from London.
London? Why?
You dropped me home at 5.
You know we all forgot.
Amar had an appointment today,
with the doctor.
I remembered just
after I dropped you home.
I went straight to Amar's house.
Papa was supposed to drive him there.
Thank God I made it in time.
Hello.
Hello.
Sorry..bad network probably.
Yeah, the mountains.
You know, there's amazing news.
Now Amar only has to go
see the doctor once in six months.
He's recovering so well.
Taran, the network is really bad.
But congratulations,
I am happy for you.
And Amar.
Anyway, I'll speak to you
later..whenever you get the time.
Yeah, okay. Bye.
Yeah, bye.
Taran..
..let's not meet for few days.
It's not Shekhar's fault..
..but, anyone can feel bad.
See you..
I am so happy you're
recovering so quickly.
This isn't done.
If you're angry,
call up..talk..fight.
This is absurd.
His phone's switched
off..and he's missing.
She hasn't slept all night..and now,
we've to go look for him.
I can't reach him.
Maybe his phone's not working.
It's not the phone,
but his mind that isn't working!
Even last night..
Let's talk about this later.
When? He's been missing for two days.
You know..
Let's not speak in front of her,
it'll upset her.
Hi, Taran.
Hi.
- Gurpreet..come on.
- Sorry..
Sorry, my friend came over and..
..we went out to watch the game.
We had some beer.
Where is Amar?
Where's Amar?
Aahh..he sleeps early.
Did he take his meds?
Did he?
He must have.
Anyway, I think it's quite late,
we should get going.
I am okay.
I am fine.
- You're not fine.
- I am fine.
- Not fine.
- I said I am fine!
- I am fine.
- Shekhar, enough.
Enough what, Taran?
Enough what?
I want to tell you enough.
Did I tell you to love me?
Did I tell you not to love Amar?
But..you told Amar, that you love me.
Yes.
I did.
Yeah..
Come on,
Shekhar..let's talk tomorrow.
I don't want to talk.
I am going.
Forever.
- Shekhar, let's..
- I said I don't want to talk.
Enough, son.
That's enough for today.
You want to go home, go home.
You can speak with Taran tomorrow.
Shekhar.
Brother..
He's not that kind of a guy.
I can't believe this.
I know.
Who is Shekhar, Taran?
He's not the son of my friend.
I lied.
He suddenly showed
up one day out of nowhere.
Both of us were in a place
where we shouldn't have been.
It wasn't his fault either, sir.
Nor was it mine.
I was right behind you two
when you were looking for him.
Waiting..
I was waiting too..
..for Amar to be found.
And get this big load off my chest.
Truth takes up a lot
of space in your heart, sir.
There's no way to accommodate it.
I couldn't take it anymore.
I thought I should tell you the truth.
Unwillingly..
..I snatched the most valuable thing
from yours and Taran's life.
I have no one..
..so I'll do whatever you say.
Take me to the police.
Kill me.
Make me your slave.
Or make me your son!
He had no reason to come here.
To tell the truth.
But from what I saw in his eyes..
..I felt he can be trusted.
All of us were..
..trying to deal with your accident,
in our own ways.
He wanted to deal with it too.
He wanted to help me.
But in a way,
he was asking for my help too.
In the beginning,
I would take him to the office.
In the evenings,
he would drop by for some coffee.
'Shekhar.'
- 'Hi.
- Hi.'
I didn't realize..when he
became more like a son to me.
You can't find him now, son.
You're ok, you're fine.
Careful.
It's just this wound over
my left eye that hurts, otherwise..
Do you have any clue
how drunk you are?
And who drives after getting so high?
Are you a doctor or a cop?
Just do your job.
What are you doing?
You're hurting that poor girl.
A little pain now..
..will save her from
a lifetime of anguish.
Let me go, please.
You don't love her?
Love is not some relationship.
It's a ray of light
which offers a glimpse of God.
And I am listening to my God now.
- Hello, sir.
- Hi.
The aircraft is ready, sir.
Should be able to take
off in about 15 minutes.
I want to meet him.
I want him to tell
me what my fault was.
And then he can go
wherever he wants to.
- Taran..
- I want to meet him.
He can't do this. I want to meet him.
But..
He will take off in 15 minutes.
I don't know where he is going.
There's no chance of
getting there in 15 minutes.
- Traffic..
- Harry..
Can't make it.
Taran's question is important.
I will get her there in 15 minutes.
But I need your help, please.
Shekhar.
Don't do this to her.
First she grieved for me..
..now she will grieve for you.
Please..what is her fault?
I know..
..who you are.
We all do.
But we still love you.
That's the problem..
..everyone loves me.
Otherwise it was so easy.
I would've quietly escaped..
..to my world.
Why did you show up again?
You made this all the
more difficult for me to leave.
Why do you want to go, Shekhar?
You had your own
world before I arrived.
And now you have that back.
And there's no place
for Shekhar in that world.
Will you decide whom I love?
Only I have that
right.. me.. not you.
If I had that right..
..then you could've
never loved someone else.
Not now..or in the next
lifetime..or after that.
Then why?
I just want to tell you..
What you're doing is completely
different from what you want, Taran.
You didn't do anything wrong, Taran.
The other day, in the temple,
when I asked you why you chose me..
..you said 'I am
doing the right thing'.
It's true that it's not my fault.
Also true that I love you.
Maybe more..
..than you know.
But not more than you love Amar.
Love is not some
responsibility, Taran.
Love is not reasonable.
It just happens.
Only compromises are reasonable.
Fine, I won't go.
Look into my eye and say..
..that you don't love Amar.
Say that every day you didn't
feel something shatter inside you..
..after you told Amar about me.
Say it Taran, and I won't go.
Say it..
Don't do the right thing, silly..
..fall in love.
It's my turn to do the right thing.
See you.
Smile..laugh..be happy..
Love..!",44670

Mukti Bhawan follows the story of a reluctant son who must take his father to the holy city of Varanasi, where his father believes he will breathe his last and attain salvation. When a 77-year-old man, Daya, wakes up from a strange nightmare, he knows his time is up and he must get to Varanasi immediately in the hope of dying there to attain salvation. His dutiful son, Rajiv, is left with no choice but to drop everything and make the journey with his stubborn father, leaving behind his wife and daughter. The two of them check into Mukti Bhawan, a hotel devoted to people hoping to spend their last days there. Rajiv finds himself having to take care of his father for the first time in his life. While Rajiv struggles to juggle his responsibilities back home, Daya starts to bloom as he finds a sense of community in the hotel, and a companion in the 75-year old Vimla. As the days go by and Daya shows no sign of dying, Rajiv is faced with the dilemma of whether to remain there with his father or fulfill his duty back home.",1038,NA,NA,NA

Rohan Bhatnagar is a kind young man who has been blind since birth and works as an animation voice actor for a living. Through his friends, he meets Supriya, a working woman who is also blind, but proudly independent. The two fall in love and get married. One night, on their way back home after dining out, they are interrupted by Amit Shellar, a local goon and younger brother of Madhavrao Shellar, a well-known politician. He and his friend, Wasim, drunkenly misbehave with the couple, enraging Rohan. The next morning while Rohan is at work, Amit and Wasim sneak into the house and assault Supriya. A horrified Rohan immediately calls the police; officer Chaubey advises him to get his wife medically examined in 24 hours to prove the assault. While Rohan and Supriya are on their way to the clinic, they are kidnapped by Shellar's men and held captive for 36 hours.

After being set free, Rohan and Supriya are criticized by police for the delay in getting Supriya clinically examined, and are accused of being liars. Heartbroken, they return home. Supriya attempts to live normally but Rohan becomes silent and introspective, which hurts her. One morning, Rohan returns early from work to apologize to Supriya for not being as supportive as he should have, only to find her corpse, hanging from the ceiling fan. Madhavrao visits Rohan and reveals that his brother Amit assaulted Supriya not once but twice. Rohan finds Supriya's suicide note, which ascertains that Amit had assaulted her a second time; this second assault led to her suicide. Shattered, Rohan implies to officer Chaubey that he will avenge his wife's death, mocking Chaubey that he will know who did it but will be able to do nothing about it, just like he did nothing about Supriya's case.

Rohan uses his voice-modulating skills to lure the culprits to places that Rohan knows well. First, he tricks Wasim and hangs him, leaving Amit's handkerchief behind to frame Amit. He then lures Amit to the warehouse where he and Supriya were held captive for 36 hours. He finds Amit by scent, tying him down to be burned alive in an explosion. Chaubey suspects Rohan of Amit and Wasim's murders and puts him under house arrest. Rohan gets past the police with the help of his friend and calls Madhavrao to a building under construction that was to be Rohan and Supriya's new home. There, Rohan kills him and makes it look like a suicide. Rohan later relates the story to Chaubey: he made it look as if Amit killed Wasim, then Madhavrao committed suicide due to the pain of Amit's death. With no evidence against Rohan, a blind man, Chaubey stands helpless. After this, Rohan scatters Supriya's ashes in the sea.",2683,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt5460276.srt","Hello, Rohan. Good morning!
Mrs. Mukherjee, good morning.
-How are you?
-I am fine.
So? Excited?
Can't you hear the excitement
in my voice?
Rohan, please be there at 10:45.
I will be there on time, don't worry.
Ok.
But, it would be better if
you could be there, Mrs. Mukherjee.
I mean, since you've set up everything.
So, if you could make it,
it would be very nice.
Why, Rohan? Are you
scared of a girl?
If I had to lie, then no.
But, honestly, a little bit.
I guess it's probably because
it's the first time.
Rohan, is someone going along with you?
Yes. The one and only, Zafar.
Oh ok... good!
All the best, then!
-Yes, Mrs. Mukherjee. Thank you!
-Ok, Rohan.
-I'll see you. Bye.
-Bye.
Hey Percy, what happened?
-Has the chain come off again?
-Yes.
Your old cycle will
never get a new twist!
Yes.
So what do we do?
Fix it, please.
Tell your dad to buy you
a new cycle now.
Rohan uncle, you know my father.
He hasn't changed his
father's vintage Lambretta yet.
-My cycle stands no chance.
-Your father is a typical Parsi.
-Hold the bike.
-Yes.
Good.
It's high time you learnt how to fix this.
-Yes.
-I've shown it to you so many times.
Let's test it.
All set.
Yes!
Thanks, Rohan.
-You are welcome.
-Wow. You are the best.
Tell me, how do you ride a bike?
With faith and confidence.
When you have these, you don't
need to see the road ahead. Remember that.
-Yes.
-Papa is here.
Good morning, Cyrus.
Son, how do you catch me everyday
without even seeing me?
Do you have a code locked
in your nose for everyone?
Mutton curry, Cyrus.
Your code.
-See you in the evening, Percy.
-Yes.
Mutton curry.
Is she here?
Tell me.
Brother...
You are quite fair.
But, she is even fairer.
Your kids will look like foreigners.
Here...
-Hello. Hi.
-Hi.
I am Rohan Bhatnagar.
Sorry, I am late.
It's all right.
This is Supriya... Supriya Sharma.
Hi.
And I am Geeta Sanyal.
Hello.
It's best if Rohan and
Supriya sit here,
you and I can sit there.
One particular snack
is very famous here.
Rohan, shall I ask for
an extra helping for you?
No...
I'll order some for you too,
my dear sister-in-law.
You come, please.
Ok.
I am so sorry.
Sometimes Zafar speaks nonsense.
I hope you don't mind.
It's all right.
By the way, every time
Mrs. Mukherjee mentions you
she's all praises.
Has she said anything about me?
Yes, so often that I could not
think of anyone else but you...
if I wanted to get married.
What do you mean?
I owe a lot to Mrs. Mukherjee.
I am here because she insisted.
Actually, I don't ever
want to get married.
Please turn down this proposal.
Any excuse will do.
Like?
Like... you didn't like me.
That means...
I have to lie in spite of not wanting to.
Rohan, I work.
I earn a living.
I don't depend on anyone.
But, in real life how can two negatives
make a positive?
Actually,
it's funny because...
I don't want to get married either.
Then... why?
The same... Mrs. Mukherjee's pressures.
Yes.
But...
in just this meeting,
I have learnt that...
you are not just confident
but also very independent.
And I think that's...
that's really amazing.
Thank you.
Can I say something, Su?
A man's self-confidence is his strength.
You and I... we are not weak.
Then why are you so afraid
of walking with me?
Because darkness cannot
 light up darkness, Rohan.
Right.
But having someone
with you in the darkness...
can make it seem less daunting.
I am confused.
Do you want to get married or not?
I do.
But, not yet.
I want to give you some time.
Just to be sure.
Of you... of me.
Of us.
So, you know...
Let's... let's just see.
Would you like some tea?
Yes.
My friend has done it.
Look at their approving smiles...
it's a yes!
Congratulations on the wedding!
Welcome the Lord Ganesha!
Welcome this beautiful Lord!
Oh sweet Lord... welcome!
Lord Ganpati!
Welcome!
Oh sweet Lord...
Welcome!
Welcome the Lord Ganesha.
So, shall we meet tomorrow?
When? Where?
Why?
If you want to be sure,
it's important to meet every day.
Isn't it, Su?
Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday
I am at the dance studio.
You dance, too?
I play the piano and
students dance.
You literally make people
dance to your tunes.
I get it now.
Rohan...
bye!
Bye, Su.
-Shall we go?
-Handsome!
Hey, is it your birthday today?
New clothes and all?
Shall I send you
some cake and wafers?
Yes, send them.
Son of a...
I've heard that love is blind.
But, the blind falling in love,
now that's new to me.
That was nice.
I know it's simple but I couldn't.
-Yes, please?
-Is Supriya here?
Yes. There she is.
-Can you...?
-Sure. I'll take you.
You guys go. I'll come.
-Supriya?
-Yes?
Your friend is here.
Hi.
Rohan!
Surprised or shocked?
Pleasantly surprised.
Thank God.
Sit.
There's... There's a stool...
Good... thanks.
How are you?
I am good.
So, till what time is this dance class?
I think this is the last session.
Coffee afterwards?
Yes. Sure.
Ok.
Let's take a five-minute break.
Su?
-Yes?
-You don't dance?
I dance.
You dance well?
I think I dance quite well.
-Really?
-Yes.
And you?
Actually, I...
Su, what is the size of this dance floor?
40 by 40.
So, square.
Any levels?
One.
And...
why do you ask that?
Because I feel like...
we should try.
-What?
-Yes.
Are you asking me to dance with you?
Yes, I am.
Rohan, are you mad?
What will people think?
If we start thinking
what people will think...
then, what will they think of us?
Su, come.
-Rohan, you are...
-Come.
Er... where are you going?
Oh, sorry.
Where is the floor?
Here.
I thought you were joking.
Hey, Supriya.
Where are you going?
That's my friend, Rohan.
He wants to explore the dance floor.
Oh, cool.
Shall I play the track?
Yes. Yes, please. Thanks.
Where does the level start from?
Right here.

Rohan, enough.
How many shoes are you
going to make me try?
One more, Su.
One more.
Su, this is the one.
Why?
What is right about this one?
This one has the right tone.
When you wear this,
I will know how close you are.
Or how far!
Come, I think we should
 buy this one.
Yes, please.
Rohan, it's a lot more crowded today.
Just a minute.
-What happened?
-It is very crowded.
Su, there is no need for this.
Ladies and gentlemen!
I am with you.
Come.
-Su, I feel hungry.
-Yes?
-Yes.
-Let's go to the food court.
It's on the first floor.
-Excuse me, where's the escalator?
-There.
Put your hands together
and please welcome
none other than... Mr. Vikram Khanna!
Thank you!
Rohan!
Excuse me, sir.
Su!
Guys, hold on one second please.
Stop pushing guys, please!
Rohan...
What are you doing?
One second, please.
What happened?
I need to go down.
Wait, you cannot go down.
Su!
-Give me some space!
-Su!
Rohan!
Excuse me.
Excuse me, is there a lady here?
She is blind too, just like me.
Why don't you go
to the help desk, please?
-Let's go.
-Where is the help desk?
-Move aside.
-Excuse me...
Excuse me...
Sorry... excuse me.
Excuse me, sir, can you help me?
I need to get to the help desk.
Sorry, buddy. I have no idea.
Excuse me.
Tell me.
Excuse me, I cannot find my friend.
Like me, he too cannot see.
Please help me.
Sorry, madam.
There is no one here.
Please call a security person.
Security...
Let me look... hang on.
-His name is Rohan. Hello...
-You wait here.
Here we have Vikram for you.
Come on, Vikram.
We are dying to hear you.
Tell us about your new film.
Every love story has
action and emotion.
But, this love story has such a twist
that no one here would've ever seen it.
Excuse me.
So, let's hear it for Kahaani Pyaar Ki.
Excuse me, is the stage this way?
Excuse me!
Excuse me.
Can you help me, please?
Excuse me!
Can you help me?
Just a minute, guys.
Security.
I have been looking for my friend
for a very long time.
She is lost.
Can you help me?
You have a mic.
If you announce her name on the mic...
It will help me.
Get him on stage.
-Thank you.
-Please come.
Such passion.
Is she a friend or your girlfriend?
Please, if you could take her name...
Make the announcement yourself.
Your love story comes first,
then mine.
Here.
Turn around.
Su...
Where are you, Su?
Can you hear me, Su?
I am sorry, Su.
I don't know how my hand let go.
I am on the stage
at the center of this mall.
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Yes?
Will you take me
to the stage, please?
Sure, please come.
Su.
Rohan.
Su.
Are you ok?
I am ok.
I am sorry, Su.
Let's go.
Come on.
Thank you!
All the best, buddy.
Have a good life.
Thank you!
Were you crying?
-Not at all.
-Really?
Rohan,
you can let go of my hand now.
I am not going anywhere.
Su.
Yes.
There was never light.
But, I felt true darkness
for the first time today.
I've always lived alone.
But today, I felt loneliness
for the first time.
What are you doing?
I am looking at you
by touching you.
I've seen you without touching you.
-What?
-Yes.
How so?
That day... at the restaurant.
And, to tell you the truth,
it was love at first sight.
Rohan, please tell me.
You are scaring me now.
Where are we going?
Home.
What?
Our new home.
We've reached.
Come, come.
-Hello.
-Yes, darling?
-Where are you?
-Where am I?
Floating high above the ground...
-but just below the skies.
-What do you mean?
I've come to show sister-in-law
the new house.
But what will she see?
That's what I want to see.
-Zafar, what are you doing?
-What happened?
Where's your attention?
Look down!
What happened?
What is this?
The elevator shaft.
Service lift.
Sixteen steps and then this hole.
-Remember.
-Yes.
It's a construction site.
Be careful.
If I had fallen from here who knows...
whether I would reach heaven or not.
Thank you, bro.
I suggest you wear this.
A harness.
It's perfect for you.
Rohan...
Su, this is our main door.
Welcome.
Come sister-in-law, come.
This is your living room.
-Which is the size of my entire house.
-Shh...
Rohan,
we won't put a lot of furniture in
our living room. Ok?
Ok. Yes.
Just basics.
And a swing in the balcony.
-Perfect.
-Isn't it?
And lots of candles.
-Candles?
-Yes. Scented ones.
I love scented candles.
Really?
Come here. I think you will love this.
-Come.
-What?
The sun...
wait... I think...
in the evening, the sun sets here.
And every time, a sweet breeze blows...
-There.
-Yes.
-Feel it.
-Yes.
It's beautiful.
Wow.
Su,
it feels as though in real life too,
two negatives are
going to make a positive.
Really?
Using my own words against me?
But actually, Rohan.
I have never even dreamt
of such things.
I was afraid.
No, Su.
Dream them.
Dream more.
Make them big, Su.
Don't hold yourself back.
Because now my goal
in life is just this;
to make myself capable enough,
to fulfill every dream of yours.
""All our dreams""
""All our dreams""
""Locked behind shut eyes""
""Where do we find the key?""
""It's in the chalice of the moon""
""And yet, if I make dreams come true""
""Will you tell me""
""Am I worthy of your love?""
""Or am I not?""
""Am I worthy of your love?""
""Or am I not?""
""This mischief, this fun""
""This is our way""
""How do I explain?""
""For it is life's secret!""
""This heart doesn't beat here""
""Just your voice echoes here now""
""This is the beginning
Of all our joys!""
""All our dreams""
""Locked behind shut eyes""
""Where do we find the key?""
""It's in the chalice of the moon""
""And yet, if I make dreams come true""
""Will you tell me""
""Am I worthy of your love?""
""Or am I not?""
""Am I worthy of your love?""
""Or am I not?""
""When my fingers draw a heart
In the soft sands""
""It will call your name
These bangles will quiver""
""Your charms are like
That of soaring butterflies""
""These colors of joy
Will not fade""
""All our dreams""
""Locked behind shut eyes""
""Where do we find the key?""
""It's in the chalice of the moon""
""And yet, if I make dreams come true""
""Will you tell me""
""Am I worthy of your love?""
""Or am I not?""
""Am I worthy of your love?""
""Or am I not?""
Parveen knows all your
rituals and customs.
She has even decorated
your bedroom.
Zafar... thanks!
Don't be silly.
-Listen...
-Yes?
I've got a special gift for you.
What?
Balloons...
Condom.
Not in front of everyone.
What are you doing?
No one is watching.
You are insane.
-Don't worry, everyone's busy eating.
-You're crazy!
Listen, anyway...
in India, whether it is
an election or a marriage,
everyone wants results
in the first year.
But, you don't rush.
There are a lot of children
in the colony already.
You take your time.
You are absolutely mad.
How long?
Hang on. I am coming.
Hurry up.
The siren has gone off?
The party will leave now?
Yes. Where to?
Amit has planned a party.
Son, Wasim,
your best friend,
Amit, is the legislator's
younger brother,
and we are butchers.
If we cut meat every day, we eat.
You have to come to the shop
tomorrow onwards.
-No excuses.
-I will come.
I am leaving now, father.
Where did brother go?
He has left with his childhood buddy.
Wasim, tell me something.
In the blind couple's
first night together,
will the lights be on or off?
Bro, I don't know about the lights.
But, the fan will be turned on for sure.
Why?
It's going to be very hot.
Amit, how do the blind...?
What?
I mean... without seeing...
Simple... by touch and feel.
Candles.
You remembered?
No.
Are there candles?
I don't know how they got here.
Really? Liar!
Su, you've completed me.
How can I leave
any of your desires unfulfilled?
I can't see but I can feel.
Everything is so beautiful.
What are you doing?
I feel ticklish.
I won't let that happen.
Hands up, Romeo!
Who is that?
Don't worry, baby.
Save me!
No! No!
You can't do that, Romeo!
It's a sin... a sin!
If you do that, I'll have
a heart attack, Romeo.
I... I...
I've got a heart attack, Romeo!
I've got a heart attack now.
Aunty, control your emotions.
Mumma...
Game... ha-ha... over!
-How was that?
-Fantastic.
Ok.
Amazing.
How does he dub
without seeing the video?
That too, while switching
between so many voices.
Are you sure he is blind?
He listens in English
and speaks in Hindi.
-You know...
-Brilliant!
-Hello.
-Su, Hi!
Guess who's in the studio today.
If you don't tell me,
how would I know?
Who is it?
Talk to him.
And guess who it is.
Hello, Supriya-ji.
How are you?
Who is this?
I am Amitabh Bachchan.
Rohan's friend.
How are you?
Amit-ji... is that you?
Namaste.
Ever since Rohan has met me,
he has been constantly
praising your beauty.
He hasn't said any such thing to me.
All men are the same.
They never say anything
to their wives.
Jaya-ji has the same complaint.
Yes, thank you. Thank you, Amit-ji.
Bless you.
May you have a
happy married life.
I take your leave
with these good wishes.
Rohan, did you hear that?
Amit-ji has blessed us so generously.
Does Aamir Khan come to your studio?
Not just Aamir, I'll get all the
Khans for dinner tonight.
Ok?
But, listen,
we are eating out tonight.
-Ok?
-Bye.
Bye. See you.
Do you know, Su?
I now know how it feels
to feel hot even
when it's air conditioned.
You gave me such
a huge love bite last night.
Huge?
I am a dubbing artist.
It's the first time a dubbing artist
was left speechless.
Ever since Anup pointed it out,
I've been walking around
with my shirt buttoned till the top.
Can you imagine?
But, who started it?
You.
Me?
Oh God. What lies!
Oh, lies?
You know, Dastoor auntie
met me in the morning
and took all the details.
No way!
And then she related
the history of her love bites
that she got 15 years ago.
Mrs. Dastoor?
Love bites?
-Can you imagine?
-Oh God.
By the way,
I've been wearing a scarf
around my neck since this morning.
Su, please give me your hand.
Your left hand.
The time is nine o'clock p.m.
I bought it with my first salary.
I will wear both.
One watch will tell me the time,
and the other, your love.
How much?
80 rupees, sir.
-80 rupees?
-Yes, sir.
Here's a 100.
Thank you, sir.
Are you fooling me
or testing me?
What happened, sir?
-It's 80 rupees, right?
-Yes, sir.
Why are you giving me
back just 10?
Give me 20.
Sorry, sir.
It happened because I was in a rush.
Here.
-What happened?
-It's fine now.
Let's go.
You know, Supriya-ji...
That auto rickshaw driver
was trying to fool me.
I knew it was you as Mr. Bachchan!
Mr. Dubbing Artist!
Using my words against me?
No, seriously.
You are quite smart,
I better watch out.
That, I am...
Who is it?
Amit?
It's you, right?
What is it, Rohan?
I am scared. Let's go.
There is no need to be afraid, Su.
I know him.
Don't play hide-n-seek, Amit?
If you want to say something,
come forward.
I have to hand it to you, Rohan.
How do you know who it is?
You have a dangerous nose.
Get out of the way.
Make up your mind.
Sometimes you tell me
to come forward.
Sometimes you tell me
to get out of the way.
Get out of the way!
Ok. I've moved out of the way. Go!
Listen buddy, I have to ask you
something very important.
Even after trying really hard,
I am unable to score with a maid.
You've managed a fine target
even in the dark.
Show some respect.
She is my wife.
Get it?
Rohan, let go of my collar.
Oh! What's this?
Look, Wasim.
Looks like our handsome man
enacted an entire porn film last night.
You don't say!
Did you give her a love bite too?
Where did you give it?
No, don't tell me.
I'll find it myself.
Rohan!
Rohan!
Don't think I am weak.
I am telling you this once.
Don't ever forget!
Don't think I am weak.
Shilu auntie, sister Mhatre,
Mrs. Shirke, come everyone.
What's wrong, Supriya?
Why are you yelling?
These boys are
misbehaving with us.
But there's no one here
besides the two of you.
They were right here.
Rohan?
Where did they go?
They've gone, Su.
They've gone.
Let's go home.
-Look, I don't care.
-Yes...
What did you tell me
while booking the flat?
Yes... I remember.
-That you will hand it over in December.
-Yes, I did.
Then how can you tell me
that I'll get it next year?
The papers are still being processed.
-What paper, Rajesh?
-Listen...
Rajesh...
I don't care.
Either give me possession of the flat
in a month or return my money.
That's it.
-I'll... talk to the boss.
-Yes.
Don't worry. I'll sort it out.
Yes, thank you.
What are you doing, Su?
What I should have done last night
when you slapped that man.
Then why didn't you?
Sorry. Sorry.
Supriya, good morning.
-Good morning, auntie.
-What's this?
Actually, auntie,
our fridge isn't working.
Can you keep the milk
in your fridge?
Sure.
Su!
Where are you?
I tried calling you
so many times today.
Do you know who came
to the studio today?
Aamir Khan!
I wanted you to talk to him
but you didn't answer the phone.
Unbelievable.
It was a fabulous chance.
You missed it.
At least answer me.
Su.
What happened?
Su.
Su?
Su, are you ok?
What happened, Su. Tell me.
What happened, Su. Tell me!
Tell me what happened.
Tell me.
Based on your wife's statement,
we've taken Amit and
Wasim into custody.
But, in such a case, a medical report
is necessary, Mr. Bhatnagar.
And it is important to
get it done right away.
Within 24 hours.
Because we can keep them in custody
only on the basis
of the medical report. Or...
Please prepare her.
Her family?
No... I am her only family.
I'll...
There is no case, sir.
She can't identify them.
And the smart asses didn't say
a word during the rape,
so she can't even identify their voices.
The entire case rests
on her sense of smell.
Will she go around sniffing
everyone in the courtroom?
And will the judge accept a
testimony based on smell?
That's why exactly I am sending her
for a medical test.
Hello.
Yes?
Ok.
The call has come?
At such a time,
it's usually what happens.
So what? Calls keep coming.
Don't worry about my calls.
-Do your duty.
-Yes, sir.
Take her to Masina hospital
for a medical test.
Yes, sir.
Listen, Inspector Chaube
has sent a car for you.
I apologize for the delay.
Let's go to the hospital.
And, Inspector Chaube
has called you to the police station.
Yes, sir.
Open up!
You said we were going to the hospital.
Where are we?
Open!
Is anyone there?
-Who is it?
-Hey!
Stop irritating me with
this constant knocking.
Look, we will keep you here
for 24 hours.
-After that, you can go.
-But, why?
Quiet.
If you bang the door again,
your wife will be--
Rohan!
Rohan?
Rohan?
Rohan.
Are you ok?
I am fine.
Rohan!
Supriya!
Rohan!
Rohan.
Rohan.
-We've reached the hospital, sir.
-Thank you.
Your report is ready.
The doctor is asking for you.
Mr. Bhatnagar,
don't expect a lot from this report.
The 24 hours from the
time of rape are critical,
from an evidence point of view.
You came here after 30 hours.
And that too, drenched.
All evidence seems to have been
washed away.
What?
Kidnapped you?
Locked you up and
threw you in the sea?
Yes.
Do you have a witness?
Witness?
Do you think I am crazy?
I've got you figured out.
You are extremely cunning.
Madam.
Have you really been raped?
-Or are you just...?
-What are you saying?
You don't seem to understand.
You'll be put away
for a long time.
For trying to frame the legislator.
Defamation and fraud.
You will be charged with both.
Where is Inspector Chaube?
I want to talk to him.
Sir is on duty.
And what will you speak to him about?
Talk to me first.
Look...
'No clinical evidence of rape.'
It is clearly mentioned.
You are frauds.
First, you lodged a complaint for rape
and then, you disappeared for 24 hours.
You thought you would
cook up a story in 24 hours.
Am I right?
What sort of person are you?
You want to make a quick buck
using a woman?
-Have some shame.
-You...
If it weren't for your uniform,
I would've broken your jaw.
This is rubbish.
I don't believe this report.
I will redo the medical test.
Come on, Su. Come.
I don't want to go anywhere, Rohan.
-But, Su.
 -I don't want to go anywhere.
-Su...
-Why don't you understand
what these people are doing to us?
Please.
I have been raped.
And ever since then, that's what
 they are doing to you.
Please, Rohan, take me home.
I am very tired, Rohan.
Please...
I feel disgusted here.
Please, Rohan.
-Please take me home.
-Ok, Su.
Let's go home.
Rohan.
Dinner is ready.
Eat.
I am not hungry, Su.
You eat.
Rohan, if you don't want to eat,
then come to bed.
I will sit here for a while, Su.
Su, please... go to sleep.
Rohan,
I understand...
Now I am not the same person I was.
If you don't want to stay with me,
I have no problem.
I have my NGO job.
I will go back there.
I know that things will never be
the same for us again.
I will assume that...
everything before yesterday
was a dream.
The food is on the table, Rohan.
Eat a little.
Your wife is so gifted
that she can stay without food
she can stay without water...
Sorry.
Rohan, I don't want to force you.
But, we have a deadline.
You have dubbed the voice earlier.
So, I don't have a choice.
Ready.
Great.
Let's go again.
Your wife is so gifted
that she can stay without food
she can stay without water
but she can't stay without talking.
Su...
The time is five o'clock p.m.
I am really sorry for yesterday.
I was silent because
I didn't know what to say.
Yesterday, for the first time,
I felt weak.
I was angry with myself.
So angry, that I forgot
to wipe your tears.
I am really sorry, Su.
But now, everything will be ok, Su.
We will go back to how
we were before.
You and...
Su... Su...
Su... Su...
What have you done?
Speak to me, Su.
Tell me...
Say something, Su.
Su!
You can't do this, Su!
No... no!
No, Supriya, no!
You can't give up, Supriya.
No!
""I am with you, burning in this fire""
""All my dreams, burnt away""
""Those moments I spent with you""
""My beloved engulfed in flames""
""The ashes of our yearning rise""
""To ask me""
""Am I""
""Worthy of your love?""
""Or am I not?""
""Am I worthy of your love?""
""Or am I not?""
Listen,
I'll go to the garage for a bit.
I've left some rice in the fridge. Eat it.
Let's go.
Your wife was pretty.
I am legislator Madhavrao Shellar.
Amit's older brother.
I don't know why I feel that...
you won't vote for me
these elections.
Youth is like a racehorse.
It sprints at the sound of a gunshot.
They have more spirit than
blood running through their veins.
I was once young like Amit.
I too, fell for Mhatre's wife...
from the colony.
But, I couldn't do anything about it.
I didn't have the support.
My father was a poor mill worker.
But, Amit does have support.
Mine.
Which means, what I couldn't do,
Amit can.
I own the cops.
I got Amit released.
Mr. Bhatnagar, I feel sorry, too.
You were newly-weds.
It was still the honeymoon
and she left the world.
But...
you were the first to be with her.
Amit got nothing special.
Don't talk to the media.
Don't talk to the people in the colony.
The more you talk,
the more it'll give rise
to defamation.
For Amit.
I have to send him to Delhi.
People in the colony
will forget in a few days.
You should forget, too.
Delete it from your memory.
All right.
Mr. Bhatnagar,
I didn't get one thing about your wife.
If she wanted to commit suicide,
why didn't she do it after
she was raped the first time?
Why wait till the second time?
Bye.
""Rohan,
I know that neither you
nor your love is weak.
We would've been fine in a few days
and would return to our normal lives.
But if what happened today,
continued to happen,
you would have broken.
And I wouldn't be able to bear it.
Today, when you went to work,
I was cooking in the kitchen.""
Who is it?
Percy.
Sister, I found the ball.
Good, and don't worry about the glass.
I will clean it.
Sister, have you made flatbreads?
Yes. Stuffed with potato.
Will you eat some?
Tomorrow, flatbreads stuffed
with cauliflower?
All right. Done!
Thank you, sister.
-Ok. Bye.
-Bye.
Even we will eat flatbreads.
That day you...
you didn't hear my voice.
That's fine.
Hear it today.
And get used to hearing it.
Because from now on,
we will keep visiting.
I will come whenever I feel like.
Let's try something new today.
""I know how much pain you are in.
And I love you so much.
I couldn't let you go through
this agony repeatedly,
I have to go.
I regret that
I am leaving you alone.
I have one last wish, though.
I am leaving these two watches behind.
If it's possible, cremate one...
and bury the other.
Yours, Su.""
Rohan,
these are the ashes.
These are not ashes.
It is my Su.
You will have to bid
sister-in-law goodbye.
Come, let's scatter them in water.
No, Zafar.
I have bid her goodbye with fire.
Water will have to wait.
Here.
What is it?
Have you come to mourn your wife
at the police station?
I want to meet Inspector Chaube.
Sir is on duty.
You have his mobile number.
Give it to me.
What do you think?
That everybody is sitting
idle for you?
Do you know what a large area
falls under him?
There are so many cases.
You don't even have a case.
You are a fraud.
Don't come back here.
I won't.
But, I won't leave without meeting
Inspector Chaube today.
Will you hold a demonstration here?
Can't you understand?
Sir is out on duty.
""Inspector Chaube... Inspector...""
Inspector Chaube,
I want to talk to you.
Hey!
Inspector Chaube.
Get out... out!
I told you to get out.
We've given you enough respect.
Now, get out.
-Nalawde.
-Sir.
Yes, sir.
Tell me.
Everything happened very fast, sir.
My Su's departure,
the closing of this case
and their release.
Mr. Bhatnagar,
we had to release them because
we didn't have evidence against them.
And your wife committed suicide.
We can't see him but he exists.
Behind every suicide the killer exists.
My Su was not weak.
And even she understood that
there is more darkness in your law
than in our world.
She would've lived
with this truth,
but after the second time,
she broke.
Second time?
What do you mean?
They came back, sir.
They raped my Su, again.
What?
He's talking nonsense, sir.
Don't worry, Inspector Nalawde.
I won't make the mistake
of filing a complaint again.
And anyway,
neither I, nor Su have
any hope for you now.
I only came to tell you that
if your system had helped me a little,
I wouldn't have to do anything.
Now, I will have to.
For my Su.
What do you mean, you will have to?
What will you do?
Will you take revenge?
A reply, sir.
I will respond to them.
And you won't need an FIR
or a medical check-up.
You may only need a post-mortem.
And you will go scot-free?
Yes, sir.
Like they did.
Perfect crime.
And what do you think?
That our eyes will remain shut?
No, sir.
Your eyes will be open,
but you won't be able to
see anything.
Your ears will be open but
you won't be able to hear anything.
You will want to say something
but you will not be able to speak.
And most importantly,
you will figure it all out,
but you won't be able to
explain it to anyone.
Are you playing a game with us?
Giving us four options,
A, B, C, D.
They started the game.
You enjoyed it.
I will end it.
-One more thing.
-Say it.
Say everything today.
There won't be
any lifeline in this game, sir.
I'll take your leave.
Amit...
-Yes?
-Where to?
There's no fixed plan yet.
I will call Wasim.
Do you know
why Nalawde is here?
We've already paid him four lakhs
 to cover things up.
Plus, the news has reached
the party headquarters.
And, you don't care.
You mess around and
your brother has to pay for it.
Enough.
No more hanging out with Wasim.
Concentrate on the campaign.
There are only two months
for the elections to begin.
If I hear about one more stupid thing,
I will send you
to our sister in Pune.
Do you understand?
Yes, I understand.
I am going.
Will he listen to you?
What can I tell you, Nalawde?
We have the same blood
running in our veins.
He won't listen.
He won't understand.
He will go over to Wasim's and party.
""Some desire me""
""Some are intoxicated with me""

""Some yearn for me""

""Then, why does the world say,
it's wrong to fall in love?""
Look, Wasim.
So what if the dance bar has closed?
Our bar is open 24 hours.
Let's have a couple.
-Come.
-How much will you drink?
-How much?
-I will drink.
We will have to stop meeting anyway.
Why?
Father is very angry.
Yes.
Even brother is very angry with me.
He says, ""You mess around
and your brother has to pay for it.""
""No more meeting Wasim.""
""Concentrate on the campaign.""
Bloody...
if I concentrate on the campaign,
who will concentrate on alcohol?
-Isn't that right?
-Let's go.
We've had enough.
Go? Ok.
So, we'll leave now.
Come on, Wasim.
Be careful. You drink so much.
""The whole world revolves
around a beautiful woman.""
Brothers and sisters, it's not pride,
but everyone knows what
our party has done for the locality.
Putting an end to injustice.
And progress for everyone.
This is our party's mantra
and this is its goal.
Victory to Maharashtra!
""Putting an end to injustice.""
""And progress for everyone.""
""This is our...""

Rohan.
Why are you listening to
the voices of people that I hate?
These voices have
silenced our love, Su.
But, very soon...
no one will ever hear
these voices again.
Hello.
Figure out a solution
for Wasim quickly, Nalawde.
He is always stuck like
a magnet to Amit.
Tell me, sir.
What is the order?
You guys detain people temporarily
during festivals.
-Yes... yes.
-What is it called?
Preventive arrest.
What an idea, sir.
I'll pick him up today.
Sir, I am... a little short.
Don't worry.
I am right here.
Meet me later.
-Ok.
-Yes. I'll come. Victory to Maharashtra!
Victory to Maharashtra!
Hello, sir.
What have I done?
You haven't done anything.
Neither will you.
-What?
-Rest inside for three days.
I will release you after that.
Take him.
Sir, please listen to me.
Come.
What disgusting behavior
is this, Amit?
What happened?
Who is it?
Hear me out.
My love, don't think so much.
No one will even know.
I am not calling you for free.
I will pay you.
Tell me, should I book a room?
Come, we will have some fun.
You are so dead.
You are dead!
So what if you are my son's friend?
You are dead now!
By tomorrow, this note
should reach every home.
-Sure.
-Each and every home.
Everyone should be
talking about brother.
Got it?
Come.
Shakeel uncle?
But, why did you slap me?
-What have I done?
-What have you done?
You are asking me what you have done?
-I will stick your phone into you.
-What?
For the rest of your life,
you will neither be able to walk nor sit.
-If you call again.
-But, call who?
Stay away from my daughter.
The old man has lost it.
-Hello.
-I made a mistake.
I thought I was talking to Payal.
Think about it.
Have I ever spoken to you
this way in so many years?
No.
Meet me once.
We will meet face to face and
clear this misunderstanding.
I don't want to meet.
Look, Lubna.
We are childhood friends.
Don't sever our friendship like that.
I want to meet you once
and apologize. That's it.
Meet me once.
Please, come.
All right.
Where do you want to meet?
Sorry for what?
Why did you lie to Shakeel uncle?
When did I call you?
You unnecessarily
got me slapped in public.
He was a college friend.
What if father found out?
Can't you take a slap for me?
I am sorry.
If you don't believe me,
I will apologize in person.
Shall we meet?
Mind your tongue, Shellar.
She is my daughter.
And don't forget that
we are butchers.
Hey... chicken thief!
There is no need to scream.
There is no need to scream!
Look, your son enjoys
his drinks with Amit's money.
Now, even your daughter has
started enticing him.
Shellar!
Be quiet.
Don't scream.
Go.
Go behind the mosque.
And see it with your own eyes.
You will understand.
You will know who called whom.
Go right now.
Lubna...
apologize now!
You seemed to be in
quite a mood on the phone.
What are you looking at?
Apologize.
Shut up! Enough.
-What?
-Are you mad?
You aren't going to change.
What are you saying?
On the phone you said that
you wanted to apologize.
And now, you are back
to your ways.
Why would I say sorry?
I think the entire butcher family
has lost it.
-No.
-Father?
It's not our family,
but yours that has gone mad.
And the biggest lunatic
is your brother.
-Hey!
-You get out of here.
I will deal with you later.
First let me cool him off.
Put the knife away.
Shakeel...
That day you slapped me,
I didn't say anything.
You play with my daughter...
Put the knife away, Shakeel.
Put the knife away.
Father!
How dare you file the complaint.
Is he dead?
Mr. Shellar, there's
Inspector Chaube above me.
What do you mean?
Your hand is first to reach
the wad of notes.
Am I wrong?
Then do the work.
Tear up the complaint.
I'll figure out what the problem between
Amit and the butcher's family is.
Send Wasim to me.
So, should I release him?
Who?
Mr. Shellar, on your order
I put Wasim in jail for three days.
Are you drunk?
When did I tell you
to put Wasim in jail?
Do I own your jail?
Do I?
No, sir.
Remember, Nalawde.
Even a dog is loyal to the one
that feeds him the bone.
Don't try to bite that hand.
Clear? Do you get it?
Yes, sir.
Leave.
Send Wasim here.
Go. Out!
Rohan, enough.
How many shoes are
you going to make me try?
This one has the right tone.
When you wear this,
I will know how close you are.
Or how far!
Hi.
You're awake?
I haven't slept.
What?
Then what were you doing?
I was waiting for you to wake up.
Good morning, Mrs. Bhatnagar.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Bhatnagar.
""Since a few days""
""I've become accustomed to you""
""Since a few days""
""I've become accustomed to you""
""Since a few days""
""You've become my necessity""
""I smile through your lips""
""I flow in your rhythm""
""I cannot live without you""
""I promise""
""I soar in your breeze these days""
""These days""
""I only walk""
""With you these days""
""There is nothing remaining of me""
""Everything is yours""
""Since a few days""
""I've become accustomed to you""
""Since a few days""
""You have become my necessity""
I didn't get a chance to get
used to them, Rohan.
They won't get time either, Su.
Don't bother.
Sit.
What's going on, Wasim?
What's going on between
Amit and your father?
Brother, Amit misbehaved with Lubna.
Have you lost it?
Amit considers your sister his own sister.
Do you think he could do this?
And your father brought
a knife to kill Amit.
Chaube has filed a complaint.
Now, what I am saying is...
I have sent Amit to Pune.
Tell your father to
rescind the complaint.
Do you remember,
I got you out in the
blind girl's rape case?
Do you remember or not?
I will bear your father's
medical expenses.
You rescind the complaint.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Go.
-Hello.
-Wasim, this is Amit.
You are calling from Mumbai, right?
The number is from here.
And your brother says that
you've gone to Pune.
Are both brothers
making a fool of me?
Wasim, I never called Lubna.
At least meet me.
I want to meet you and
clear everything.
Where will you meet me?
Amit?
Come, Wasim.
Look. I've got you
the best whiskey today.
Scotch.
I have to make
peace with my bro,
so I thought the whiskey
should do the trick.
Isn't it?
You stabbed my father.
Misbehaved with Lubna.
Do you think
I'll have a drink with you?
Forget the bad behavior.
What respect did you show
the blind girl?
Hey.
Lubna is my sister. Get it?
And we both had fun
with the blind girl.
And that too, twice.
And what's with this
new concern for the blind girl?
Who is she to you?
Everything.
She was everything.
How did you manage
to sound like Amit?
It was you on the phone,
wasn't it?
I am blind
but I can hear.
And I can make you hear
what I want.
Enough.
The lights are on now,
and you are off!
""We can't see him but he exists.""
""Behind every suicide the killer exists.""
Sir, has the blind guy
started playing his game?
Are you crazy, Nalawde?
Look at the preparation.
And he cannot see.
He is incapable of this.
What is that on his shoulder?
Sir, a handkerchief.
A. S.
Amit Shellar.
Nalawde, animosity runs
just as deep as friendship.
Find out where Amit Shellar is.
Yes, sir.
This is not a suicide,
but a murder.
How are you, Chaube?
Amit was in Pune yesterday.
Do you have proof of
Amit being in Pune yesterday?
Are you questioning me
or doubting me?
Both.
Look, Chaube.
The number of years
you've been playing cop,
I've been playing politics.
Do you think I'll allow
something so stupid?
Amit is a rascal
but he's not stupid.
Do you think he'll commit murder...
and then leave his handkerchief
on his shoulder to get caught?
For now, circumstances and evidence
are both against your brother, Shellar.
And if my investigation
leads me to your brother,
I will not step back.
Did I ask you to step back?
Remember, I support my brother.
Madhavrao Shellar.
Go.
In the name of Allah
who is merciful and benevolent.
All of you, please pray
for the soul of the deceased.
Who is it?
Are you crying?
One day you too, will have to cry, sir.
The day you cut onions at home.
Come, Inspector Chaube.
Will you have vegetables
made in the Kolhapuri style?
What do you do?
I am self-employed, sir.
I know a bit about sound
and I make do with it.
Where were you last night?
At home, sir.
People stay awake
because of the noise,
and the silence doesn't
let me sleep.
Yet, I am trying, sir.
Is there a witness who can confirm
you were home last night?
What sort of question is that, sir?
Does anyone keep a witness
while they sleep?
But sir, why are you asking me
 these questions?
Because Wasim was murdered last night.
And you think that I did it?
At first, I didn't think so.
But, seeing you at Wasim's burial today
got me thinking about it.
Then, I remembered your challenge.
Did you forget?
Sir, I said that in a fit of rage.
And why would I murder Wasim?
Because he raped your wife.
For which you found no evidence, sir.
Then, why did your wife commit suicide?
Sir, what are you here to investigate?
Wasim's murder or my wife's suicide?
An eye for an eye makes
the whole world blind, Mr. Bhatnagar.
A perfect world, sir.
If everyone is blind,
no one will need the police.
Sir, have you ever arrested a blind person
in a rape or murder case?
A perfect world, sir.
Where everyone is blind.
By leaving behind
Amit's handkerchief next to Wasim,
you've tried to mislead the police.
But, the road ahead won't be so easy.
-I know that now Amit--
-Will burn, sir.
The food, sir.
Please let go of my hand.
It will burn.
Thank you, sir.
It doesn't feel right to use
the third degree on a blind man.
But, if needed, I won't hold back.
The next time we meet,
it won't be in your kitchen,
but in our interrogation room.
Remember that.
If only you can find evidence
against me, sir.
-Did you call, sir?
-Yes.
Did you get Amit
and Wasim's call records?
We'll get them by tomorrow.
Did you get Shakeel's statement?
Yes, sir.
He is very angry with Amit.
He said that he would avenge
his son's death
before the mud in his
grave dries off.
Amit is going through a bad time, sir.
-All right.
-Thank you, sir.
-Hello.
-Hello, this is Nalawde.
Tell me, Nalawde.
-You are in Pune, aren't you?
-Yes, where else will I go?
They found your handkerchief
on Wasim's body.
Have all of you gone crazy?
I did not kill Wasim.
I know.
I even know who killed him.
It's your turn next.
Tell me his name.
He will be next.
Not on the phone.
Meet me.
You know where to meet, right?
How would I know if you haven't told me?
What warehouse did you
keep those blind people in?
The one at Madh. Why?
Exactly! There.
And listen,
I don't want anyone else there.
We have to meet in utmost secrecy.
All right.
Rohan, are you ok?
Blind guy, you?
But... Nalawde's voice?
How did you manage his voice?
Rohan, you are quite the artist.
What a plan?
Blind fellow, I am not Wasim.
I am not going to die so easy.
Avenging yourself?
Will you take revenge?
Now?
Do you have a plan B now?
You want to play the game
of revenge, right?
Let's play.
Here.
Pick it up.
Up!
You hit me once... I'll hit you once.
Hit me.
Hit me.
It's my turn.
Give it.
Give it to me.
I have to hand it to you.
You are blind, but gutsy.
Handsome! Are you dead?
Your wife was stronger than you.
I had to try very hard to
 bring her under control.
Especially the second time.
Here.
I am giving you one last chance.
Pick it up.
Come on.
If you had continued to wear your shoes,
you may have survived.
Even a dead man can
smell your socks.
Now, you tell me...
do you have a plan B?
You were right.
-I am taking my revenge.
-Hey!
You didn't kill Supriya.
No.
I won't kill you either.
Do you know who will kill you?
No.
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you.
Tell me.
Brother, it's Amit.
He has tied me up
in the Madh godown, brother.
Please come and save me.
I'll tell you everything.
I am coming, Amit.
I am coming.
Please, brother.
I am an artist.
I agree.
I am good.
-Rohan...
-I am so good.
Rohan, let me go.
Rohan...
Rohan, what are you doing?
Rohan, don't do this.
I said I was sorry, Rohan.
Let me go.
Rohan, what are you doing?
Amit!
Amit!
Amit!
Amit!
Don't you worry.
Don't worry, I am coming.
I am coming!
Sir...
Where is the body?
The body is completely burnt, sir.
He didn't burn himself,
he's been burnt.
Shakeel has burnt him.
Shakeel is still in the ICU
in the hospital.
Find out who did this.
Or the whole city will burn
just like my brother did.
Let's go.
Sir, I am sure the blind guy
is playing his game.
I suggest taking him in.
Are you crazy?
We don't have any evidence.
To top it off, he's blind.
All the social organizations
and the media will hound us.
Rohan, you did as promised.
Enough.
Get back to work.
Get back to your life, Rohan.
No, Su.
There is still work to be done.
This episode is not over.
Rohan, who were you talking to?
How did you get hurt?
It's nothing.
Listen,
are you bunking school again?
There is a football match between
our colony and Navjivan society.
I am going for practice.
Percy, you are a lost cause.
And what now?
Now, speak to the principal or
I will get a scolding.
And one day, if your father finds out.
Then what? You and I.
Don't worry. Nothing will happen.
Please. For the colony's sake.
All right.
But, this is the last time, Percy.
Yes.
Percy Dastoor.
Percy Dastoor's father.
Hello, Father Rodrigues.
Good morning, Father.
This is Cyrus. Percy's father.
I am so sorry, Father
but Percy has fallen sick again.
We tell him so much,
but he eats so much junk.
From today, we won't let him
eat junk food even by mistake.
Nor will we let him miss school.
Yes, Father.
Of course, Father.
Don't worry.
So, the secret is in your voice.
I kept wondering why Wasim went
to that closed theatre to meet Amit?
It was their drinking spot,
but Amit was in Pune.
Why would he come
to Mumbai from Pune...
when he was safer in Pune?
Who called him?
Why did he agree?
Whose voice did you mimic to call him?
You are very talented, Rohan Bhatnagar.
Remember...
you told me there would be
no lifeline in this game?
But, you have given me
a lifeline on your own.
24 hours.
And this case will be closed.
Thank you, sir.
For what?
For the 24 hours.
Nalawde,
get me Rohan Bhatnagar's
call records and keep them ready.
-It's urgent!
-Ok, sir.
Get Amit and Wasim's call records too
and keep them on my table.
I'll check them myself.
-How many men are at the police station?
-There are four, sir.
Get everyone to Guru Kripa
colony immediately.
Ok, sir.
-We have to keep a watch on someone.
-Yes, sir.
Yes... now.
I am giving you 24 hours.
But, we won't take our
eyes off you for even a second.
Inspector Chaube...
will you answer a question for me?
Truthfully.
If you were in my place,
what would you have done
to Wasim and Amit?
I am in no hurry for your reply, sir.
But, the day you answer me truthfully,
I won't lie to you.
Hey, WhatsApp club.
Yes, sir...
Be alert.
You slack, and there will be trouble.
Switch off the mobiles
and keep a watch.
-Yes, sir.
-Fools...
The time is 10:20 a.m.
-Sarmalkar,
-Yes...
I am messaging you
four landline numbers.
Give me their addresses.
It's very urgent.
The time is nine o'clock p.m.
-Sarmalkar.
-Yes, sir.
-I gave you four numbers.
-Yes.
You've messaged the address
for only one number.
-Where are the rest?
-Sir, all four have the same address.
-What?
-Yes, I did a thorough check.
-They all have the same address?
-Yes, sir.
That's why I sent one message.
All right.
Hey!
Where are you headed
this late in the night?
Sir, in Mumbai, this time is not late.
And, even if I want to go somewhere,
do I need permission?
Hey!
Don't get smart with me.
You are Bhatnagar's friend, aren't you?
Yes.
Is that a problem, too?
Which of them is Rohan?
Sir, this is my family.
But, I'll show you their faces.
Because you are mistaken.
Come to the side.
-Come.
-There.
Parveen.
Are you satisfied?
Can I go now?
Go.
What time does this open
in the morning?
7:00, sir.
-Hello, sir.
-Nalawde.
Is everything ok there?
Yes, sir. It's all ok.
Just be alert.
This case will be closed
 by tomorrow morning.
Yes, sir.
Sir, Chaube is here.
I would've definitely
offered you a drink...
but you won't drink with me.
I will, today.
Why?
Are you feeling sorry for me today?
It's not that, Shellar.
You never understood...
but I've always helped you.
After the rape, when you called me...
I handed both of them over to Nalawde.
Knowing, that he would
 hand them over to you.
In Wasim's case,
if I wanted to, I could've arrested
your brother from Pune.
But, I didn't.
Why?
Because I call for a show only when
I have all three aces in my hand.
Now, neither you; nor this city
has to burn.
Because we've found the person
who burned your brother.
Tell me the name.
Name the price?
Take as much as you want.
Tell me his name.
I will hand him over to you
tomorrow morning.
Not in the morning.
Right now!
If I tell you right now,
you won't believe it.
I will get him tomorrow
with a witness and evidence.
The thing is...
I will take a promotion
from the government,
and money from you.
Cheers.
I would've killed them both.
Amit and Wasim.
Remember, you asked me a question?
How did you kill him?
Wasim?
Amit?
No.
Shellar.
How did you get out of the colony?
-Zafar.
-Yes, Rohan?
Listen.
I need yours, Percy's and
Sakharam's help.
Sakharam, who?
The one who fumigates in the area.
Where are you headed
this late in the night?
-Speak.
-Brother, it's me.
Amit.
What?
Amit?
Brother, we...
we made a huge mistake, brother.
I received my punishment for it.
But, now it's your turn to be punished.
What rubbish.
It's not rubbish.
I am telling you the truth.
Who is this?
I am the same person who called
your brother to the godown.
If you have the balls,
tell me your name.
Rohan.
Rohan Bhatnagar.
Wait. Wait right there.
I'll come to your house and kill you.
There's no point in going there.
The police are everywhere.
Tell me where you are!
You will come, right?
You won't chicken out?
Take down the address.
Shellar!
Do you know,
why I called you here?
This is where Su and I
were going to make our home.
But you people did not let that happen.
Hey, Bhatnagar!
Enough is enough.
If you wanted to hide,
why did you call me here?
Come on out.
Sir!
Get him.
Anna!
It's your turn now.
Now what?
You already played your card.
I have a plan B for you.
Your brother asked me
the same question.
I didn't have a plan B, then.
I do now.
Come.
Drop it.
It's over Bhatnagar.
A press of the trigger...
and your story ends.
But, that's too easy.
You killed my Amit in such a way...
I could not even perform
 his last rites.
So, I am going to make you suffer.
Get up!
My Su didn't have an easy death.
You will not have an easy death, either.
I won't die alone.
We will both fall.
We will both fall.
But, only one will die.
Su committed suicide.
But, it was a murder.
This is a murder,
but it'll look like suicide.
So, Amit killed Wasim,
and Shellar, Amit.
And repenting on killing his brother,
Shellar committed suicide.
Very good.
That's very smart, Rohan Bhatnagar.
But, every criminal leaves some
trail behind after committing a crime.
You've left a whole witness.
Just one more hour.
Don't move.
Do you remember the fourth option, sir?
What do you mean?
It's ok, you'll figure it out...
but you won't be able
to explain it to anyone else.
Did this man make calls from here?
Mimicking different voices.
Sir?
If I could see,
I would've surely told you.
A perfect world, sir.
Where everyone is blind.
No.
I see peace on your face
after many days.
So what if I am not with you
in the world?
I'll always be with you, Rohan.
Walk on.",51713

Ek Thi Rani Aisi Bhi is a story of conflict between righteousness and autocracy, between modesty and pride, between idealism and opportunism. It is the saga of the king who loved his people and died of a broken heart when separated from them. It is the legend of the queen who never compromised with her faith and became the mother of millions of propagating love. The merger of the princely states with the Indian Union after Independence had left several kings and queens disheartened. Especially when those monarchs considered their subjects as their own children and whose objective was to improve the lot of the people. It was a difficult situation to cope with.

Maharaja Jivajirao Scindia of Gwalior was one of those unfortunate monarchs. He died prematurely, leaving his wife, Vijaya Raje Scindia, at the mercy of a political party. She struggled hard but, in the process, lost her son in the war of ideology. She was never reconciled to the fact that her son would join hands with those who brought hardship to the people. It was the beginning of the end of a relationship between a mother and her son. It was a difficult situation for the mother. But she had never bowed down to those forces and went her own way. It was a road that finally led to the triumph of truth, faith, and human values.",1310,NA,NA,NA

In 1995, Prem Prakash Tiwari is a young owner of a video cassette shop in the local market of Haridwar, who subscribes to a nationalist organisation. One of the key values of the organisation is abstinence, although senior members are married and there are no restrictions on the marriage of junior members. However, it is expected that their members should not indulge in their married life at the expense of service to the nation. His father is keen on getting him married to an educated overweight girl Sandhya. In spite of not liking her, the school drop out Prem agrees to marry her. In addition, as Sandhya is trying to be a school teacher, his family asks him to think of this alliance for financial help too. Eventually, in an elaborate community-wedding ceremony, Prem and Sandhya get married.

Prem visibly shows his disinterest in the marriage and does not consummate the marriage on the wedding night. At home, Sandhya tries to get Prem attracted to her. But he is too embarrassed to even walk with her on the street. Prem and Sandhya's relationship remains strained although they share a kiss and have sex on their second night together. The branch manager advises him that since he could not uphold his oath of abstinence he should rather focus on his married life. Over time, Sandhya's frustration shows; when Prem's aunt brings up a petty topic, the two have a heated exchange of words and she tells them how he does not treat her well.

Amidst all this a close friend of Prem, Nirmal gets married. Prem and Sandhya go for the ceremony where due to his excessive drinking and jealousy over Nirmal's pretty wife, he tells everyone that sleeping with Sandhya feels like hell. Sandhya hears this and slaps him in front of his friends and he slaps her back. The following morning, Sandhya reflects on what she's been through, feels she has had enough and decides to leave Prem. Meanwhile, Prem decides to channel his energy into studying and to take his English paper again; he enrolls for the examination. His friends give up on him; after a verbal squabble, they throw him out of the group. He studies sincerely for the exam, but at the time of his exam, he is overwhelmed by the emotional turmoil and is not able to write a word. Ultimately he plainly writes an emotional message to the person checking his paper that if at all he feels any pity for his state he should not award him with a zero or else his family would be reduced to zero (indicating his suicide attempt).

Soon, Nirmal's father opens a shop selling music CDs in the same market, clearly affecting Prem's family business. Prem's family talks to Nirmal's family and the discussion ends with Nirmal challenging him to participate and win the ""Dum Lagao"" contest, which entails him carrying his wife on his shoulders and running an obstacle course. Meanwhile, Sandhya and Prem reach the court to file for divorce. Prem's father pleads the judge that divorce should not happen on petty issues and his family is more than happy to take her home, Sandhya's parents too feel the same and support him. The court decides that the two must spend six months with each other and try to salvage their marriage. Both decide to live together just as a formality, but they soon begin to get on, as they both start understanding each other. Meanwhile, Sandhya is coerced into the contest. They start getting close with each passing day, but according to Prem, they lack co-ordination and are a total mismatch.

One day as Prem returns home, he is disgusted to see that his family members are pretending Sandhya's terrible culinary skills. He finally snaps and expresses his anguish over this pretense, and attempts suicide. A police constable arrives at their home, owing to a complaint regarding the emotional letter (attempt to suicide) he had written in his English exam. Sandhya is moved by this, and they have a deep conversation with each other. Sandhya gets a teaching job in Meerut, which she gladly accepts since she feels that there is no one who cares about her anymore. When she tells Prem about it, he cannot come to terms with losing her and realises that he is in love with her.

On the day of competition, Prem's aunt successfully convinces him to participate in the competition and the couple takes a last chance to save their marriage. Surprisingly, Prem shoulders the weight of his wife and surges past all other contestants. In the last lap, Sandhya confesses to Prem that she does not want to go to Meerut and wants Prem to let her stay. Prem knows winning this competition is the only way to do this and pushes himself further to eventually win the race.

Prem does not let Sandhya get off his back even after the race is over. He takes her back all the way to his house where they seal their love with a kiss.",5017,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt3495030.srt","Official YIFY movies site:
HEAVE-HO, CARRY THAT LOAD
Three things in this world...
...bring tears to my eyes
Papa's shoe
English exams
And singer Kumar Sanu's voice
All painful
You...
You are the answer to
my every question
You are the heart
of all my stories
Didn't I tell you?
Don't record with headphones.
You'll burst your ear-drums
- What did you say?
- What did I say?
The Rishikesh priest asked us
to see the girl
He wants us to come to
the temple tomorrow
Finish the recording today
What is this mess?
Throw this out
Yes, Papa
Here's 20 rupees
Yes, Papa
Don't let the cows get into
the shop
Yes, Papa
Jaya! Did you bring the lemon pickle?
Have you got money
for the temple?
Prem, get in the back.
There's no time
Hurry up!
Ma, my saree is untying
I told you to tie it with a pin
Hold it
Let your father pass
Hold your breath in
Tuck your saree in
Cover your head. We're going to
a temple, not to your college
I can't find the saree end
- What are you doing?
- Why didn't you oil your hair?
Tell him...
...to sit with confidence
No need to misbehave
You're our only son, our pride
Don't chomp on your food.
Don't spit when you talk
You talk as though I'd
never seen a girl before
You want some water?
How far is the temple?
Someone's getting restless
to see the girl
Let's introduce ourselves
The girl's father, Madan Pal
The boy's father,
Chandra Prakash Tiwari
His wife, Subhadra Rani
Boy's mother, Shashi Tiwari
Boy's sisters, Jaya and Hema
and their husbands
She's my younger sister.
Prem's aunt, Naintara
I think the boy and girl should
introduce themselves
Absolutely
Sandhya
Sandhya
Prem, introduce yourself
You've done it, Papa
One person missing, Samar.
Sandhya's younger brother
He has exams,
so he isn't here
- Is Sandhya educated?
- A degree in teaching
She's wanted to teach
since childhood
She even taught her dolls maths
Ask him yourself
She asks if Prem is educated
Prem has a degree in Commerce
He's always been keen
on accounting
He's more interested in
bank notes than books
Think it over and tell me
I already have
What do you say?
The girl is lovely. Did you
notice her good nature?
She didn't speak.
You talk of her nature
Being silent in front of her elders
is a sign of a good nature
So you prefer the girls who
waste time in your shop...
...recording songs?
You listen! She's a nice girl.
That's it
A nice girl! And her appearance?
What's wrong?
Is she blind, deaf, mute, crippled?
Saw her size? Huge
You're no movie star,
you high school dropout
It's the food these days
Your sister put on pounds
after she got married
Her husband still loves her
They chose each other.
What choice do I have?
To hell with your choice
Your choice will turn your parents
into paupers
Papa, talk to him gently,
he'll understand
So, you try
Listen, son
If she was attractive, we'd have
to buy her cosmetics
She'll earn money. She's going to
be a teacher
- It'll help us
- I will not marry her
- That's it
- How dare you!
Do it, Prem. For the family's sake
I'll look for a lovely special girl
Not temporary, someone permanent
I'll look for a big earner,
sober and sweet
Not temporary, someone permanent
Eyes like a golden fairy
A magic wand in her hand
I'll look for the perfect bride
He'll have a bike and a car,
good manners too
I'll consider him,
that's if he's faithful
She'll go with me to visit Shimla,
Kullu Manali
But not forget to buy veggies on
her way home from work
That's the one for me
I'll look for a graduate, a lively,
cheeky type
Not a fellow who looks old and grumpy
He's a man who masters
household chores
No, no ordinary type, you see
A deluxe model will suit me
Are you ok?
My head is about to explode
Take a pill. You'll feel better
You want to die at your
own wedding?
I told you - don't drink milk
after Chow mien
Papa, it's his allopathic meds.
He's throwing them up
No one stops him
Give him some soda,
he'll be ok
I really like the scent of marigolds
Welcome
See how beautiful the room looks
Prem's aunt hand-picked the flowers
- Prem loves them
- She sneezed
You have a cold?
I'm allergic to flowers
We'll get rid of them
in the morning
The room is decorated
with a lot of love
Remove all the flowers
Where is it?
Don't rush things in bed
Let her get a job first.
Babies can come later
On paid maternity leave
You feeling ok?
The bathroom?
Change here
Ok
Wait. I'll go out
You can come in
Sandhya
- A call for you
- Coming, Mummyji
Hope I didn't wake you
- How did you get this number?
- So, how was last night?
He behaved like a child...
... abandoned somewhere
He slept in one corner of the bed,
me on the other
Listen, I'll call you later. Bye
Wake the Prince of Celibacy
out of his slumber
Don't talk so loud
She can hear you
You worry about being overheard.
But not about your son
Don't blame him. She could've
made the first move
She's arrogant
Just because she's educated
She didn't even greet me
at the wedding
Giggled away with her family
Sure! We aren't in her league
Why blame the poor girl?
Think of how she must feel
Our son is work-shy.
He's so arrogant
A boy like him should be
taught a lesson
Good morning, Mr. Groom
- Where to?
- The Youth Club
The Youth Club will ruin you
You want to become a freedom
fighter. Can't kill a fly
- We'll talk later
- Wait a minute
Yes, we'll talk later.
Look at me
Look at me. Well?
You can hit me if you want.
I'll do as I please
One whack will sort you.
Where's my shoe?
Don't hit him
How sweet! She's made us tea
Prem is at the Youth Club. He loves
working out, since childhood
Is your family into fitness?
Only Papa. I do yoga at home
It shows
We salute those great men
The great men who have given us
the wisdom of life
We bow a hundred times to
those great men
Remember the martyr Bhagat Singh
The leader Subhas Chandra Bose
Shivaji Maharaj and Vajpayeeji
Do you think any of these great men
lacked focus?
No
So, let's promise ourselves
To let their lives inspire us
To follow in their footsteps
Of course!
- I have news. Prem is married
- Congratulations!
- That calls for a party
- Yes
Papa is against inviting riff-raff
I agree with him. I'm against
parties too
So be it!
Study hard, ok?
Give it to Jaya
- Take care of our Prem
- Sure
Give us a missed call.
Ring once, and you ring twice
Go safely
I don't know what's
happening to me
So run away
Who is stopping you?
I couldn't make high school
The computer course was in English.
I'm zero at it
Papa pushed me into marrying
And you're saying I must run away?
Mom, it's the first day.
Things take time
I woke up late today
The alarm didn't ring
No action and you wake up late
If this goes on, your in-laws
will send you home
Mridula can't keep anything
to herself
God has been kind to you.
You married a video tape guy
Ask him to show you an erotic film
It'll give you ideas
Rebel
Rebel until you find a way out
I can't rebel. But in the bedroom
I can
It's my battlefield
If he is a little shy,
make the first move
Pleasing your husband is
your responsibility too
Walk slowly, please
I've finished engineering.
Have some sweets
Prem!
Straight and first right. You'll see
Vijay's shop. I have work
Aren't you coming?
Just take one piece - not
the whole box
You know Vijay. What will I do
in a ladies' store?
- See you later
- Listen!
Namaste, sister-in-law
- Will you have some tea?
- No, thanks
Where's Prem?
He's busy
I need some stuff
- These bangles are lovely
- Not bangles
Something like that
See this
No. Next to that
- This one?
- The one above
Sister, show them to her.
I have work
Can I help?
A nightgown?
- Sure. Any undergarments?
- Only the nightgown
It will really suit you
That's fine
And this is the inner...
All right. I'll take it
Tell me when you're done
inspecting them
I was looking at their handbags
Sure you were
Hey Prem, is that your wife?
Yes
- You brought your wife shopping?
- I'm Sandhya
That's Pervin
Very pretty. Visit me some day
I live nearby. Drop by sometime
- Hurry!
- Just shut up and wait
Tehmina, get my purse
- Let me talk
- Why do you want to talk to her?
Have some sweets. I've just
finished my engineering degree
Easy. I have to give some
to the others
What was the big hurry?
You didn't let me talk
Why are you getting angry?
What have I done?
I am talking to you
Take me to the government library
Ok, I'll walk home
- I'm telling you straight
- This is a library
I don't like talking to people
Who asked you to talk?
I was talking
What's your problem?
I don't like chatting with
all those shopkeepers
I don't like being interrupted either
Does it bother you if
I talk to someone?
You don't know these people
When I am alone, they will
get after me
Where's the celebration?
My father was right
People here like keeping
their money locked up
Sandhya wants to see a film. Papa
is setting up the VCR
She should've got her own TV.
Why must we miss the soap?
Nothing happens in those soaps.
You won't miss anything
I'm hanging up. Ask Hema to call
Can I please close the window?
Sure. Lock it
Listen
Please close the window
The window
Can you set up the VCR?
Are you ready?
""Martyrs' Day""
Aren't you watching?
Not in the mood
Send the TV back
- I'll tell Papa...
- Why tell Papa?
We'll watch it together
Put the light off
Quilt?
Water?
Our child just became a man
Bless us, Lord
Where are you going?
I want to share the good news
with my daughters
Tell them tomorrow
Did you see the whole film?
I don't get tired halfway like you
I saw it till the end
Who heats the water at your place?
We have a geyser
- Did you have breakfast?
- No
How did your exams go?
Maths was tough as usual
Make sure you pass
No one in our family has failed.
I want top marks
You talk like your family inherited
the world's brains
She is Prem's aunt
You leaving?
She's going
- Let your brother eat
- I've eaten
They don't eat much.
But every grain shows
It's called metabolism
My respects
Where's Prem?
What are you doing?
Help her with the luggage
Give my regards to your father
Travel safe
I left a list of songs on the table
- Record them for me
- If I have the time
Come on the 4th
- Why?
- Why do you think?
Let's go, Samar
I couldn't say no to Papa
about marrying
I couldn't stop myself last night
Domestic life is going to
drag me into quicksand
What can I teach a person
who has no will power?
I feel suffocated. What will
power do you mean?
Don't live in denial.
Just accept the reality
How can I accept someone
I am not attracted to?
How do I look?
Do whatever, you will always
look a witch
Want a slap?
This is my life now
A gravitational pull is sucking me
Accept defeat then
It's not gravity
The pleasure in bed
is pulling you
Don't be ashamed of pleasure
It is not pleasure.
It's compulsion
So enjoy your compulsions.
Why else are you on earth?
All objects in this universe
are drawn to one another
The law of gravity
So why do some objects
not meet...
...and stay fixed in their place?
Although...
...they want to reach out to
one another, they cannot
Play
- From here?
- Press
Listen to the sound
Son, is this a CD?
A CD - a compact disc.
This is the future
Give up the old stuff
Listen to the sound
Really good
I'll get you a good deal. About 150K.
Plus a CD player
How much for this lot?
There are no buyers for this
Cassettes are only sold as scrap
No one cares for them
We'll have to start the business
from scratch
Why can't we get a loan?
I haven't repaid the loan I took
for my daughter's wedding
I told you
No borrowing money
Suggest something then
I suggest you put the radio
under your pillow
Listen to Kumar Sanu's love songs
We'll manage somehow
- When do you get Sandhya?
- On the 4th
That's today
She's waiting for him
and he's busy hogging
Give him more food
Why don't you call him?
He could call me
Are you keeping score?
Anyway I'm better than he is
Papa, please eat
Samar, come and eat
Don't give me too much.
Leave something for Prem
There's no need
I'll go check
Prem, welcome
We were expecting you
- God bless you, son
- Get him some snacks
Hello, brother-in-law
- Give him a plate
- No, thanks
- I have an early start
- Eat something
No thanks
Shall we go?
Prem, keep this money
No, please no
Take it. It's for good luck
Keep it. Buy something for me
Hold on to your bag
- What's wrong?
- I'm hungry
But you said you ate
Sit here. I'll sit over there
Give me some kachori
with onions
You eat onions?
- Yes. But my family don't
- My family eats onions
Must you go on about your family?
We eat onions. We don't sleep
before 12
What can I do if you all lie?
At least I know something
about you now
You smoke?
And drink. No one drinks
in your family?
No
Don't tell anyone
Will your father hit you?
I am not scared of anyone
You're the fearless
warrior of the family
Eat up
- Want some?
- No, thank you
The threads of endearment...
...are entangled in your fingers
I cannot find a way...
...to untie the knot
My life is like that star...
...that passes through the clouds
You must be a little crazy
To have chosen me
How did you hear...
...my unspoken words?
What's wrong?
I want some water
I'll get it
The girls today know everything
What's good or bad for them
Good or bad... they also
enjoy their youth more
But what does Prem know?
Weren't you excited when
you were young? Wasn't I?
It's their time to have fun
Need something?
He was feeling hot
You're shameless! Hush
Here
Did you record my songs?
What?
The spices are on the top shelf
- Sugar and tea down below
- Where's my medicine bottle?
I threw it out. The meds had expired
You threw it out?
I bought it two months ago
Expired pills are not good
for the health
Don't show off your education.
I know what expiry means
I was trying to help
Why do you keep taunting me?
I asked about my medicine bottle
If you must, here it is
Answering back, eh?
We'll talk later
The way you talk. Making
a mountain out of a molehill
You should be grateful
Without me...
Prem wouldn't have married
a fat girl like you
As if Prem was some movie star
If you made him marry me...
...you should've taught him
how to treat me
Listen to her!
I was married too
I ran a house, but I never
answered back
Don't talk to your elders like that
No one cares about me. They only
think of themselves
- What is it?
- Ask your dear aunt
Where are you going?
Just ask me to unpack
Why did you marry me?
Get my clothes. I'm late
Here. I'm late
Greetings
- Raghubir, what brings you here?
- For you
- What is it?
- Sweets
And an invite
A wedding invite?
Nirmal's wedding?
Congratulations!
Listen, everybody. Prem
They met at college? So that's
what they teach nowadays
She's a dentist
Prem got left behind because
of English. Otherwise...
Stop it! Call Sandhya
She is busy. Why call her?
I called out for you
But Prem took you away
You must come to my party
Ok
Saying okay won't do
Sandhya, he won't listen to me,
so...
...grab him by his ears
and bring him there
Have your tea. It's getting cold
I told my father-in-law...
...to hire a community centre.
We'll have 500 guests or more
A 21-gun salute for my family
They agreed. Their gift.
Made in Japan
Amazing sound
What song do you want hear?
- Any song
- Which song?
I am a cut from the
old matrimonial school
Prem is the new generation
I fancy matrimony, but my
girl's father doesn't fancy me
Our Youth Club leader said
we must avoid domesticity
Why think now? You're halfway there
Marrying Deepti is not wrong
Show her photograph to Prem
That's Deepti. Fresh as a rose
Anyway, tell me how's married life?
Can't you tell?
- If Sandhya sees you drinking...
- She can go to hell
Prem, you're drunk.
Give me your glass
Sir, I respect you...
I listen to your advice. Don't
say anything now
Leave me alone
My father ruined my life.
I stood no chance
None of you help me one bit
Control yourself, Prem
Nirmal, my friend.
You got it right
You worked hard. You're
a gentleman. I'm illiterate
And your Deepti - she's perfect
- She'll make you happy
- I know
No one asked if I wanted a life
like this
Papa hitched me up. We're like
oxen under a plough
Wait, Prem
Sandhya is a good girl.
Looks aren't everything
Then why show me
Deepti's photograph?
Why do you love Suman?
You're like my brother
Drop it!
She's so fat. I don't feel
like touching her
Sleep with Sandhya one night...
...you'll know what hell is
Stop him!
I'll kill him
You hit me
I hit my sister, thanks to you
Stop him
Where to?
Let's sit down
and sort things out
Papa has hit him enough
Prem's father knows what's best
for him
- Take my shoe and beat him
- Never mind, Papa
It's not his fault. It's yours
You should've helped him study,
instead of getting him married
Don't go
What are you doing?
Tell me, will you?
You gave my room to Samar
No phone. No letter.
How come you're back?
I've left Prem. No more questions
Left him? Are you crazy?
Did he hit you? I'll sort him out
Look! She tore up my school files
How will I get an A+?
Don't eye my room! I'll fix you too
Why are you waiting?
Call her in-laws
- Ask her what happened
- Don't dare call them
Over my dead body
As if you were sparkling with life.
Why are you here?
He does not need me.
I do not need him
He wanted a wife
He has no manners
He insulted me in front of
the whole neighborhood
He called me a fat cow,
and other things, mother
But you are a fat cow
Men are men. They talk nonsense
when they're angry
Why argue with him?
Even if he was rude, you're smart.
You should've kept mum
Kept mum?
I gave him a tight slap
He won't talk to a woman like that
for the rest of his life
This is what too much education
does to a girl
No need for your tears, mother
Nothing happened. I am intact
Have some shame
Be modest in front of your father
Explain to her
Listen, women have to...
That's enough
Please listen
The warhorse Chetak galloped,
setting the earth on fire
When Chetak rode into the battlefield,
the enemy was destroyed
Now it is time for you to run.
Fly with the wind
Enough
Time is short and the task is hard
We have to win
Sure
Being sure will not make you win
Sure
Ok
Use your brawn and brains
to win this race
How?
Hop on, son
That's it
This is how you'll win
Son, get off now
Start exercising
Why, sir?
Are they avoiding me?
Nothing of the sort. We're busy
preparing for the contest
Am I not invited?
We wanted to invite you but after
what happened
Yes, sure
You hypocrite. Lecturing me
and licking Nirmal's boots
Mind your language
Just because my wife left me,
everyone is ignoring me
Calm down. Let's talk
I know you people
They're enjoying my predicament
Stop talking nonsense
Let go. I'll slap you
You'll hit me?
Scum
- Showing me your pretty wife's photo
- Don't drag her into this
I'll drown you
What's all this?
Go
He's upset. I'll talk to him
I've had my eye on him
No unruly boys here
- He'll be ok
- Take him away
Throw cold water on him
He's too hot-headed
Aunty, you don't worry at all
These days the law is with women
You should believe in yourself
and the power of women
You know there are many amendments
favouring women these days
Sandhya's case is super strong
- Will they stay together?
- She's talking about divorce
- Then why is she smiling?
- Must she cry?
Water
Move!
Did you change your surname
on your passport, or...?
No
Did you give any dowry?
Any TV, VCR, sofa scooter,
anything?
- Who is giving us a TV?
- She asks if we gave anything
Let me talk
We spent about 20,000
Jewelry, clothes, etc
Madam, we spent very little cash
- Her jewelry is still with her mother
- In the bank locker
What about my humiliation?
Who pays for that?
Sandhya, that's not how you speak to
your parents
They also want your good
Say sorry
Stop stirring up my daughter.
We educated her
She wants sister to apologise
- To whom?
- To you, for being rude
Sandhya, don't lose heart, ok?
Just concentrate on your exams
Aunty, don't take tension
Divorce is very cool these days
It's the means to a happy life
I did not study law
But I know we had a happy marriage
I am sure
Come with me
Are you drunk?
Don't be stupid.
Go, get your wife back
Like hell. I won't
I'm won't be a loser anymore. I'll
make something of my life
Good movie lines, that's how
film heroes talk
People like us must live
connected to reality
I'll re-sit my high school exam
I will not live with my gloomy family
Are you nuts? You're a married man
Your wife will soon be a teacher and
you want to carry a school bag?
Look at me
Don't I dream of becoming an actor?
Look at the ham actors today
My father forced me to live here.
I'm wasting my life
My only hope is that Suman's father
accepts me
Then life is set
You love Suman, right?
If her father marries her to someone
else, would you do nothing?
There's a big difference between
reality and the movies
Do you know the truth of my life?
""36B""
""Sister, 36D. The elastic is strong
and long-lasting""
Dog! Siding with my enemies.
I'm better off alone
Do as you please
- Saraswati Coaching Centre?
- Yes
I want to re-sit the high school
exam
Show me your certificates
She's made bland food
Don't interrupt.
Let me see the recipe
She'll make us sick, dieting
I won't stop you. Eat what you like.
This is for me
This is the last straw.
First she left her husband
Now she's dividing the kitchen
- What are you cooking?
- Poison. Want some?
No. You go ahead
Papa?
- A new CD shop is opening
- Whose shop is it?
It's here
- Isn't this Nirmal's shop?
- Let's see
How can one market have two
recording shops?
Is this Nirmal's shop?
Yes, it is
When does it open?
The opening ceremony is over
We're in trouble
What will happen to our business
if you open a music store, Nirmal?
You have everything
A decent wife, too
He misbehaved at the Youth Club.
I came because of my father
Be polite, Nirmal
Don't act pious, Nirmal. It took you
no time to ruin us
Have pity. His wife dumped him
Not surprising
You got him married to that hippo
against his will
I'll break your head
See how he behaves!
- Think before you talk, sister
- What did I say?
The shop is our bread and butter
We are not here to do charity either
You must be happy. Bankrupting others
You're just jealous.
Jealous of our success
Success? My foot!
We know your father paid a bribe
to get you into college
Who is stopping you from using
your brain cells?
The only thing that's free is whining.
That's all you do
Stop taunting me
Have some cake first
It's her birthday. Some respect
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
I'll give you a chance to save
your shop
Take part in the wife-carrying
contest
Win and the shop is yours
Nirmal, don't talk rubbish
This is too much
I'm serious
You'll never learn.
Go, open your shop!
We have 15 years of experience
recording tapes
If I was married...
- ...I'd take part in the contest
- Naina, keep quiet
That's enough from them
Take part in the
wife-carrying contest
I will not. Let my father carry you
You will carry your wife and run
It's your birthday, but don't talk rot
I have told him. He'll run
- I won't
- Yes, you will
Has she gone senile?
Haven't we been humiliated enough?
What's wrong?
Why is she lying down?
- She tripped
- How come?
Are you ok?
What's wrong?
The divorce notice
The bet is off
No
Yes, we get it
Hurry! The judge is leaving
Hope I don't leave this world
before him
What is it?
I'll sit in front
- What shall I do?
- Take my hand
Push me
Going to bring the girl back?
You must wish us bad luck,
right?
Drive carefully
Sinister man. He curses everyone
Your sister's husband went to
the mountains looking for God
Pervin's husband is in jail
The bra seller can't convince his girl
And Prem has a divorce notice
Chant in the name of your mother,
not God
She keeps talking nonsense
What did I say wrong?
There'll be lots of crying
Stay calm
So cry once and for all
I'm very proud of you, Sandhya
Is everyone here getting divorced?
- Is that right, Prem?
- It's a divorce court
Stop talking
Is there anything I should know?
- What's that?
No need to beg Sandhya.
Papa will carry you and run
No way
Why is God punishing us?
A disaster
Don't cry. We're the guilty ones
Who wants a ""divorced"" sign
outside their house?
Look what happened to me
Sandhya Varma, Prem Prakash
Tiwari. Divorce Petition
Tiwari is accused of insulting
Sandhya Varma in public
Hurting her physically
and emotionally
She asks the court to grant
her divorce
The Tiwaris must pay a divorce
settlement of 50,000 rupees
But she filed for divorce.
Is it mutual consent?
Yes
Was it a love marriage?
Just a marriage, no love
Then why did you marry him?
I liked him
And you?
Financial pressure. Sandhya
would teach and earn
Papa wanted a bride
who earned a salary
So I agreed
Anything happened -
kisses, intercourse, etc?
- I won't discuss private matters
- He loves humiliating me in public
- Hitting me made you proud?
- I am ashamed of that
- You humiliated me
- As though you didn't do the same
And what's this ridiculous
settlement demand?
- Don't you know our situation?
- What about me?
Did you think before slapping me?
Quiet, please!
Do the family members
want to say anything?
Your Honour, what can I say?
You're wise. Misunderstandings
are commonplace
That doesn't mean separating.
Just come home
Prem's father and I fought too
Once I added extra salt
in his mother's food
He hit me hard with his shoe.
But I didn't leave home
Am I talking Greek? I'm asking her
to come back
Do only men have the right to talk?
Must we just cook and clean?
This is your chance. File a case
of domestic violence
Discuss your emotional
matters outside the court
As per the Marriage Act, the court
asks you to live together for 6 months
If matters are not resolved by then...
..the court will approve the
divorce papers
Sandhya, come back.
We're pleading with you
I'll get my room back
Forget the law. Just come back
- Ask him to say sorry
- Prem, come here
The one who slapped first,
apologises first
Who insulted me in public?
Apologise!
All right
Sorry
She's your new mother.
You'll look after her now
Hold this
Please come
I'm already feeling better
The time has come to carry
your personal load
Right here in the heart of Rishikesh
All husbands! Flex your muscles
All wives, lose some weight
The winner gets 10,000 rupees
""Heave-ho, carry that load""
The wife carrying contest
Can I say something?
It's not ""of"" Monday.
It's ""on"" Monday
And we say ""in"" August.
Not ""on"" August
The preposition is used differently
Why did you touch my book?
I was just...
But why? Don't show off
your education
Ok. I know you're very smart.
I know nothing
I'm a fool and uneducated
But stop putting me down
Listen, bear with me
Better we accept the farce
happily
I'll go in six months
""In"" and not ""on""
Leave this in room 12
I am a student...
Roll Number 317
- Take a seat
- Thank you
Dear Teacher...
I am 25 years old
This is my third attempt at
the English exam
My father was right. I'm a loser
My struggle to make something
of my life ends here
If you feel any pity...
...or this letter moves you,
or your eyes moisten...
...or if you're unmoved and want
to throw away my letter
Or give me a zero
Remember you are zeroing
the fate of a family
Today I accept...
...that I have failed my family,
my wife...
...and myself
Prem Prakash
Start serving
Give Prem some of this tasty
steamed food
Why the long face? Sandhya has
made a delicious meal
We'll eat together
- I am not hungry
- We've been waiting for you
Papa closed the shop early today
Have you already eaten?
You're drunk?
Freshen up. He is coming
I must say boiled vegetables
taste delicious
Spices cause acidity
Sandhya has made great food
Lentil broth
- It's really tasty
- I forgot to add carom seeds
It'll taste even better tomorrow
- It's fine
- Have more then
Let Sandhya have the cottage cheese
No, Papa. Let him have it
Eat up
I was thinking - Prem and
Sandhya should partake...
...in the wife-carrying championship
Great idea
No, Papa
It's embarrassing. It's too strange
What's strange about it?
Prem's father carried me
and ran four times
That's another thing we didn't win
Prem is very keen to participate
in the contest. Right?
Sure. Why do you think that
I brought her back?
He's always had a sense
of humour
See that?
Couldn't you have played along
and had your meal?
I can't pretend
You all know the tricks
You must know me by now
I know nothing of the world
You must think I am blighted
- Come here
- What are you doing?
My family's affections are a sham.
Lies!
They are eating what they prefer
We were hungry
It's my fault. I tricked her
into coming back
She'd run the race, save our shop,
get a job too
It's all my fault
Let me end my life
- What are you doing?
- I'll kill myself
You've been sweet-talking Sandhya,
she doesn't care about us
Where are the matches?
Sandhya, diet or exercise...
makes no difference
Someone will love you
as you are
It's all a sham
The whole neighborhood
can watch me burn
Where are the matches?
Prem Prakash Tiwari -
Roll No. 317
What happened?
Well, he wrote his English exam
in Hindi
He had planned to commit suicide
This is all family matters. It's ok
Suicide? He couldn't even kill
a mosquito
Did you really want to kill yourself?
Did you really love me?
You never gave me the chance
To express myself or to feel
I am unworthy of being loved
You know...
I was very keen on marriage
But no one told me what
marriage really is
As if anyone told me. I was misled too
Be smarter the next time
Will you invite me to your wedding
if you found someone?
Who will marry me?
I'll find you someone...
...who loves and respects you,
cares for you
That's what I thought you'd do
Sorry
It's all right
I'll find you someone you are not
ashamed of
Who doesn't brag about her education
Where's a girl like that?
As if there were dozens of suitors
for me
Papa, let's sell the shop
Your call. You wanted a music shop
I'm off, aunt
- Bless you
- Wait
I'm coming
See that?
They wanted you back
for their selfish reasons
A team spirit is needed
True. We aren't a team
nor are we as one
Never mind
Listen
Best of luck
Go straight
Namaste
Sandhya Varma?
Documents, please
My file? I had it with me
You came for an interview
and forgot your papers?
I can't understand. I had the file
Can I come back tomorrow?
The interview is for today,
not tomorrow
Namaste
You forgot your file
Your file
Who is he?
My husband
Your husband?
My papers
Quite impressive
Have you gone through them?
We have no vacancy here
But there's a job in Meerut
If your family allows you,
you could work there
I'll persuade them. Don't worry
- Is it possible?
- Yes
12 feet
Business is bad
I've been saying that for a while
I know. Put the shop on sale
at once
Inform us soon
""Wife-carrying contest""
I've made your song tape
I've left the tape here
Welcome
Did you hear about the interview?
No
I'm sure you'll get the job
How do you know?
I just know
May I say something?
You can leave whenever
you feel like
No one will stop you
My family is jinxed
There is no point suffering
on our account
Think about your future
Ok?
It'll turn out fine
I have the job
In Meerut
So you've decided?
There's no one here to stay for
There are very few buses
to Meerut from here
If someone wants to see me,
they'll find a way
Have you lived alone?
No
Never had a broken marriage
either
I am Siddhesh, your husband's
brother
Yes? How come you thought
of me after so many years?
Sister-in-law? Sorry, I didn't
recognise your voice. Bad news
Your husband has died
He went to the Himalayas on
a pilgrimage. He died in a landslide
He died the day he left me,
15 years ago
Can you come for his last rites?
What connection do I have
with your family anymore?
Did he ever call or write to ask
if I was dead or alive
I thought I should at least inform you
Who was it?
Siddhesh
What did he say?
I am a widow
I've been a widow for years anyway
Meaning?
Greetings, uncle
Where's Prem?
Are you ready for the race?
As long as you race when you
carry my funeral pyre
What's wrong?
That's enough
Come
Can I come in?
The door's unlocked
Vijay came to take you for the race
Your Papa told him to go
Look, I never got a chance...
...to be a wife
To have a family.
I've just lived as a widow
This is your time. You both
should make the most of it
No one is running in that race
What's the use?
Thinking of what's useful has done
nothing for us
Doesn't matter if you win or lose.
Do it for yourselves
Forcing never achieved anything
He doesn't want to
As if you do
Why ask if you don't want to race?
Haven't we lost enough face
in the town?
We've lost everything
Nothing left to mock
If there's nothing to lose...
...then why not run for yourselves?
Can't you carry me?
Of course I can
I didn't go to the Youth Club
for nothing
Shall I ask your mother
to phone your sisters?
Why not?
""Heave-ho, carry that load!""
I'll be back
You're here!
I've signed you on
Our honour is in your hands
God bless
Make sure you win
Don't pressure us. It's enough
that we're running
Why are you negative?
Look who is here
Can you carry her, Prem? Or do you
need your Papa's help?
Well, sir?
- What are you doing here?
- To hell with...
...my father and her father too
We got married this morning
Well done!
Brothers and sisters
The time has come to shoulder the
responsibilities of marriage
Let's see who makes it to the end
You'll face many obstacles
Who will win 10,000 rupees?
To inaugurate this race
we have with us the voice...
...that has captured
the heart of millions
I request Kumar Sanu to ring
the bell and start the race
One...
Run, Prem Prakash Tiwari!
Open your eyes, tie your shoelaces
Fire your breath like a bullet
Be careful
Both feet in one tyre, then the next
It's not easy
If you were in my place you'd know
Hold tight
I knew the Youth Club leader
was a fraud
The flying horse was no help
Prem Tiwari and Sandhya Varma...
...are advancing slowly
You look good together
- You too
- Can you talk later?
You never learn
Run like a true man,
kick up a dust storm
Will you make it?
Aren't I doing ok?
- Don't let go
- I won't. Look ahead
Scale all walls, cross all rivers
- What's wrong?
- It tickles
Ok?
Are you ok?
Deepti
- Here
- I'm hurt
You crazy?
- Hurry
- What the hell?
What happened?
- What's so funny?
- Just look at you face
As if you looked lovely
If people are jealous, so what?
No need of modesty
If anyone tries to sneak away,
show him up
The thing that knows no end,
soak forever in that madness
The ground trembles
wherever your foot treads
I don't want to leave.
Keep me with you
There! The winners
of this year's contest...
...Prem and Sandhya
Looks like they're not done yet
My heart was never as carefree
as now
Like a letter...
...that found a new address
We walk on empty roads
With our eyes closed
Ending up in a faraway place.
Aimlessly
The threads of endearment...
...are entangled in your fingers
I cannot find a way...
...to untie the knot
I don't care about my tears
But there is someone whose
tears I cannot see
Sandhya
Now you will see a song
composed by Anu Malik

"30","tt1980970","Gandhi to Hitler",2011,"Plot

The film is set during World War II and centres upon the letters written by Gandhi to Adolf Hitler, and around the relationship of Hitler with his long-term lover Eva Braun, whom he married in his final days in the Berlin bunker in which they died. The film depicts the difference between the ideologies of Gandhi and Hitler and claims the superiority of Gandhism over Nazism.

Another plot within the film concerns a young Indian couple who, while both dedicated to gaining independence for India, turn to greatly different paths to achieve that goal. The wife chooses to follow Gandhi, while the husband ultimately joins the Indian Legion, leading to dramatically divergent outcomes. Even though the wife's ultimate fate is not clear, the scenes towards the end show that the husband fails to return to India alive after trying to flee the collapsing Third Reich. The film concludes with the Indian flag flying high and a note stating, ""15 August 1947: India wins freedom"", demonstrating the superiority of civil disobedience and nonviolence over militancy and terrorism.",1079,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt1980970.srt","'Dear friend,'

CaII Dr. GoebbeIs.
What happened?
Why do you Iook upset?
I think Fuhrer's enemies are
attacking notjust from outside..
..but from inside as weII.
You mean traitors?
Such peopIe have no
sympathies from me.
Everything wiII be fine.
Everything wiII be fine?
I have to go and meet Deh Fuhrer.
'21st ApriI 1945..'
'..the Russian Red Army
had virtuaIIy surrounded..'
'..the city of BerIin.'
'To save their Iives, the civiIians
had started moving out..'
'..Iooking for safe havens.'
'The hapIess German
army graduaIIy started
surrendering itseIf to
the Russians.'
God bIess you, Amrita.
May God be with you!
How are you?
Fine Bapu.
Did you receive any Ietter
from your husband BaIbir Singh?
No, Bapu.
It's been three months
since I Iast heard from him.
I am certain it wiII come soon.
It is just that,
I'm a IittIe scared.
Be brave, dear.
Have faith in the AImighty.
Amrita, Iisten up. Listen up.
'Indian Legion soIdiers..'
'..after Subhash
Chandra Bose Ieft Germany..'
'..these soIdiers were
forced to fight onIy for Germany.'
'These weary soIdiers
now have onIy one wish..'
'..which is to somehow
cross the European border..'
'..and reach their motherIand India.'
- Go. Go. Go. Run.
Dr. GoebbeIs, you Iook afraid.
You did not get the Ietter?
Yes, Iast night.
I'm reading Shakespeare.
I may be in the fouIest of moods..
..but reading
Shakespeare aIways cheers me up.
Danger knows fuII weII that
Caesar is more dangerous than he.
We are two Iions Iittered
in one day.
And I, the eIder and more terribIe.
And Caesar shaII go forth.
My Fuhrer, there is no power in
this worId that can defeat you.
Our victory is certain.
What was our intention of
coming here?
What are we actuaIIy doing?!
We are fighting a battIe.
- Against whom?
Against whom?
Against our impending death!
Hey! My name is Himmat.
Himmat (courage).
OnIy on paper.
You must have the power too.
Go surrender to the
British army if you are scared.
Go Iick their boots!
Hey!
- Shakir.
If you guys shut up,
then perhaps you wiII not feeI
the urge to fight each other.
And if you cannot do that,
and shoot each other.
Murder one another!
And if you can't even do that, then
go to jump off the nearest cIiff.
Everything wiII be easy then.
The Russians are now
and I am being
informed about this now?!
Were aII officers
snoring untiI now?
They are watching the
drama unfoId Iike cowards.
I never beIieved that my officers..
..wouId turn out to be
so pathetic and weak..
..under the present circumstances.
It wouId have been better
if I had just Iike StaIin did.
At Ieast Germany wouId not
have had to bear the burden..
..of such wretched and
puny officers!
My Fuhrer, this is
done by those traitors..
we have received
information on who they are.
They are Ieaking aII
our secrets to the enemy.
Find the traitors and shoot them!
Carry their bodies to the square
so that the worId knows
what the consequences..
..of betraying Germany are.
The things that threaten me..
..never Iook, but on my deck..
when they shaII see the face
they are vanished!
KeiteI's report is here, My Fuhrer.
The Russian convoy has raped..
..one thousand five
hundred of our heIpIess women.
They wiII pay for this.
Prepare every singIe woman
for the protection of our country.
I want an eye for an eye!
An eye for an eye makes
the whoIe worId bIind.
I pray to God to grant
wisdom to those
who agree with this ideoIogy.
We have Ieft the barbarity..
..of the past far behind.
Yet, a few
disiIIusioned peopIe aIways take..
..the decision to wage war,
and the hapIess
citizenry of a nation..
..has to bear
the consequences of it.
No side wins in a war.
Both the sides Iose
to a certain extent.
And there are other
ways to conduct a fight.
My dear feIIow Germans,
it is Fuhrer's 56th birthday today.
I had just been there,
and no arrangements for
the party have been made yet.
And what about the band?
Where can we find a band
in this war situation?
Dr. GoebbeIs said that
he'II arrange for the band.
Oh wow! That is fantastic.
Whatever you seen on the
streets is a part of our strategy.
BerIin is absoIuteIy safe.
Don't go by the rumours,
and what a few journaIists..
..bought over by
the enemy are saying.
The government machinery wiII
naturaIIy be affected during a war.
But these smaII obstacIes
cannot break our moraIe.
We have to face the
enemy under aII circumstance.
Our victory is certain.
Happy birthday.
Yes.
Okay, everyone. It's aIright.
Music.
My Fuhrer, it's been
three months since..
..we have been in the bunker.
You can't stay here anymore,
it is fraught with danger.
We have aircrafts at our disposaI,
And enough fueI to get us to Japan.
I am not Ieaving BerIin.
But your safety is necessary.
You'II be abIe to handIe this
war better from outside of BerIin.
I am Germany's Ieader,
not some coward.
I can't Iive covertIy in jungIes,
settIements and hiIIs.
Dr. GoebbeIs, Speers,
you two stay back,
the rest of you can attend
the party.
So the Russians are using our
bridges and buiIdings to destroy us.
Here, aII these bridges..
..bIow them up.. and aIso,
bIow up these buiIdings.
But my Fuhrer,
We wiII have to do this.
I know you buiIt this
whoIe city with great effort.
But our enemies are
using the same to destroy us.
Have you gone mad?!
You are betraying the Fuhrer!
Eva, peace is the onIy soIution.
If we surrender, our
and the Fuhrer wiII be safe too.
Your words stink of betrayaI.
Had my sister not been pregnant..
..I wouId have toId
Fuhrer the truth about you.
I am very much obIiged, Eva.
The Fuhrer is purposeIy
pushing us towards death!
Fuhrer wiII get a terribIe shock,
when he discovers
that he trusted a coward Iike you!
But our death is certain here.
Just shut up, and Ieave me aIone.
Dr. GoebbeIs.
Dr. GoebbeIs, pIease
stop this destruction.
Did you think about
the civiIians even once?
Are you worried about the
or your architecture?
If we continue to erode Germany,
it wiII never progress in future.
Germany is not so weak, that a few
war damages wiII hamper its growth.
Our enemies have attacked.
We have Iost some wars,
and won some wars.
What was our condition
during the First WorId War?
We have seen great destruction.
But we have come back stronger,
each time.
Why don't you want
to face the truth?
The truth is: I won't aIIow
my country to be defeated.
I have just one request to make,
pIease save this city
from compIete destruction.
It has taken thousands
of years to deveIop..
..our civiIisation,
and it wiII onIy take few
minutes to destroy aII of it.
Some peopIe are doing the same..
..by acting in an emotionaI,
irrationaI manner.
I agree, the enemies have
or they are trying to do just that.
But, this doesn't mean that
we shouId
deIiberateIy destroy ourseIves.
We shouId fight with the enemies..
..using 'Ahinsa'
(non-vioIence) as the weapon.
'Dear Amrita, by now you
may have received the news
that the battIe is
in its Iast phase.'
'Even today, I distinctIy
remember the day I joined..
..the British army, and
Ieft India to fight against..
..AdoIf HitIer and Germany.'
'I...I didn't Iike it one bit.'
BIess you, my brave son.
'Because we are ensIaved
we had no other option but to come
and fight the war on their behaIf.'
'But when Netaji
Subhash summoned us..'
'..and we Ieft the British Army and
a new enthusiasm took
birth inside each one of us.'
'A feeIing to fight was aroused,
to fight for India's freedom.'
'But destiny has cheated us.'
'Netaji had to Ieave,
I don't know why.'
'And we were forced to
join the German SS force.'
'And our dreams to attain freedom..
..for India were
buried by the Germans.'
'But we took an oath that we
wiII not accept defeat. Never.'
'We have to fiII a new enthusiasm
in this accessibIe heart.'
'We have to repay the
favour of our MotherIand.'
'The paths on which the martyrs
we have to scatter under their
feet in disguise of fIowers today.'
'We had decided to
return to India at any cost.'
'The paths which we
tread upon are periIous.'
'After passing through jungIes,
and crossing many seas,
one day I wiII meet you
where I first Iaid my eyes
upon this I promise you.'
Brother, what happened?
You were about to go somewhere,
weren't you?
Let's go.
Do you know the
meaning of the word 'wife'?
This is your famiIy now.
Try to adopt the ways and
vaIues of this househoId.
You know, once a woman
gets married..
..she goes through a rebirth.
She forgets aII the
memories of her previous birth.
ChiIdhood reIationships,
friends, reIatives, aspirations,
they now appear to her in fIashes,
nothing more than a pIeasant dream.
Amrita..
..if you wiII waIk on the
principIes of Mahatma Gandhi,
you won't be abIe to fuIfiI any of
your responsibiIities compIeteIy.
Do you want me to shy away
from my responsibiIities?
'I hope that mother and father are
not worrying too much about me...
... pIease don't be upset
when you think about me.'
'I wiII return. We wiII aII return.'
'Take care. Yours, BaIbir.'
Some music, My Fuhrer?
No.
Sorry. I was just...
I can't stand seeing you so upset.
AIright..
..pIay some good music.
'Henrick HimmIer, minister
for internaI security..'
'..and externaI defense.'
'Considered one of
the most powerfuI..
..and cIosest
associates of AdoIf HitIer.'
'During the finaI days of the war..'
'..this miIitary
commander tried to compromise..
..with the Western AIIied Forces..'
'..hoping to be the
ChanceIIor of Germany.'
I have decided..
..there is no other way out.
Very soon before the aIIied forces,
I am going to offer a
proposaI for compromise..
..to the aIIied forces very soon.
But...
There is no question of
ifs and buts now, Herman.
What we are Ieft with at the moment
is the Fuhrer's stubbornness.
So I have decided,
whatever is needed to be
done now, I wiII have to do it,
I mean we have to do it.
By the way, Eva Braun
is your sister-in-Iaw.
Get her to understand, if you can.
ExceIIent news, My Fuhrer.
I am sorry. I am sorry.
Never mind. TeII me.
We have received the
inteIIigence report that the war..
..between the Russian and
American armies has begun.
I know. Extreme
marxism and high capitaIism
can never unite with each other.
The worId needs nationaI sociaIism,
and nationaI sociaIism is my gift.
These are the signs of
your victory, My Fuhrer.
I knew it is bound to happen.
You are very cIose to Eva.
You make her understand.
This pIace is not safe for us.
AII of us wiII be kiIIed.
My Fuhrer, BerIin is
surrounded from aII sides.
Let them come. No
one wiII return aIive.
But My Fuhrer, we don't
have enough arms and fueIs.
You don't aIways fight
with arms and fueIs;
sometimes you fight with your mind.
TeII Steiner,
he wiII handIe everyone.
My Fuhrer, Steiner has
a shortage of soIdiers.
Then force every citizen
to enter the battIefieId.
Every chiId, oId man and
teenager wiII fight for Germany.
But My Fuhrer, civiIians
don't even have anything to eat.
Excuses! Excuses! Excuses! You
have excuses for everything.
PeopIe of Germany haven't died yet.
This is my order.
Yes, My Fuhrer.
This is the worst war in
the history of mankind.
Our peopIe are
fighting for a something..
..that is far removed from truth..
But the reaI dharma is
the dharma of truth.
He who is honest
to himseIf is great.
Doctor, there is stiII time.
Fuhrer can be taken
out of there safeIy.
Your Iife is very
dear to you, isn't it?
What do you mean?
Fuhrer has decided that we wiII
stay here, and fight from here.
Everyone is not a coward Iike you.
Doctor..
..if Fuhrer is
stubborn about it, Iet him be.
Why shouId we risk our Iives?
Doctor, your wife
and chiIdren have come.
No one is in their senses.
Everyone has gone crazy.
WeIcome to the bunker.
Now this pIace wiII become IiveIy.
- Thank you.
Where are our rooms?
- Over there.
HeIIo? How are you?
The pIace is that way, and
you are going to Iove it.
See how beautifuI the room is.
How is it?
And how is that?
Dr. GoebbeI's wife
and chiIdren are here?!
Have you brought your toys?
Yes, I have brought my car.
Very good. And you?
I have brought my books,
because I Iove reading.
ExceIIent! You know what;
the Fuhrer Ioves books as weII.
He reads one book everyday.
You aII enjoy yourseIf..
..I wiII arrange for your
snacks quickIy. Okay?
Dear, your earrings are reaIIy nice.
- Yes, yes.
Where did you buy them from, dear?
I bought them in a fair in Amritsar.
Are you keeping good heaIth now?
- Yes, I am fine.
Come here.
What is your name?
- Veer Singh.
What is your father's name?
- BaIbir Singh.
What wiII you become
when you grow up? - SoIdier.
He is so sweet, isn't he?
'Veer Singh. What is your
father's name? BaIbir Singh.'
'What wiII you become
when you grow up? SoIdier.'
Your son has taken after you.
He reminds me of our first HoIi

''The season of festivities is here.''

I am stiII fuIfiIIing aII the
responsibiIities of the famiIy.'
'And I now feeI that

..has reaIised the strength of

'Without shedding a drop
of bIood we have proved
that wars aren'tjust fought
with guns and cannons aIone.'
'We don't want to

instead, we want to
hurt their conscience.'
'They wiII have to bow down
in front of 'Satyagraha'.'
'They wiII Ieave India
heIpIess and powerIess.'
Stop them.
Come on, pick it up.
Come on. Just take it.
Go.
LittIe higher.
CIose. My turn.
WonderfuI.
Thank you. Thank you.
Now Russians can't escape us.
Cigarette?
- Ya.
Did they onIy Iearn how to
handIe spoons and forks..
..in the miIitary academy?!
I have never been to
any miIitary academy.
I rose up from the
rank of a smaII soIdier..
..from the rank of a
smaII messenger to this post!
I am trying to turn
timid mice into Iions.
Where are my taIented officers?
Is everyone hiding out of fear?
My Fuhrer,
Goering has sent a Ietter.
'My Fuhrer, things are
getting out of controI.'
'I think inside your bunker,
you are either cIueIess about..
..what's going on in
the outside worId or,
some peopIe are creating
misconceptions in your mind.'
'I have aIways been
your IoyaI officer,
I request you grant me
the authority..
..to compromise
with the aIIied forces.'
'Germany's betterment Iies in..
..handing over the command to me.'
'PIease understand
that teIephone and..
..other modes of
communication have been severed.'
'So, if I don't
receive any answer from you..
..by 10 o'cIock tonight,
I wiII assume that
I have been given authorization.'
'Yours sincereIy, Goering.'
That's so funny.
HeIIo!
Aunty, she says that
butterfIies are green in coIour.
And what did you say?
I said grasshoppers
are green in coIour,
and butterfIies are bIue in coIour.
But I have seen green
butterfIies in the garden!
WeII, butterfIies are both
green as weII as bIue in coIour.
So both of you are right.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Bye.
Dr. GoebbeIs' chiIdren are so sweet.
You never taIked to Fuhrer about it.
What couId I have said?
That I want chiIdren as weII.
How couId I have toId him that?
I am not his wife, I'm his mistress.
But you two have been
together for 12 years.
So for him you are more than a wife.
When he first saw me, I was young,
right out of schooI.
We instantIy feII for each other.
After that, he never
expressed his feeIings.
About chiIdren, famiIy,
he never said anything.
Nothing.
And then...we never
taIked about these things.
But you couId've asked!
- He never gave me a chance.
I am dismissing him from his
post right now, this instant.
Germany is Iosing
because of traitors Iike him.
We don't need outside enemies,
when our own men are betraying us.
Go. There must be other
traitors Iike him, doctor.
Find them aII.
HeIIo, heIIo, pIease
controI Dr. GoebbeIs...
There is a message for
the Fuhrer. HeIIo, heIIo!
ShameIess swines!
AIbert.
I had received a
message that you are coming.
I came to say goodbye.
Magda, I can take
you to a safer pIace.
We have boats.
- Boats?
May be you don't know,
but my husband and
I have decided to stay here.
I was thinking about
the chiIdren, Magda.
The chiIdren wiII stay here,
AIbert.
And what about their future?
They don't have a
future without the Fuhrer.
That means they don't
have a right to Iive?
You can Ieave if you want to.
I don't need your advice.
Okay.
AIbert.
- Eva.
I knew you wouId come.
Fuhrer thought you have Ieft.
Fuhrer doubted my IoyaIty.
Fuhrer thought that
you are against him.
But I was sure that you wouId come.
Thank you, Eva. Thank you very much.
WouId you Iike something to eat?
Biscuits? Anything
eIse I can offer you?
Something to drink?
Champagne?
- Yes.
The very best of course.
- Thank you.
I know this room is sIightIy smaII,
but it's exactIy Iike I wanted.
- Thanks.
And have you noticed
I have brought aIong aII the
furniture that you designed.
Oh, reaIIy!
It's beautifuI, thank you.
- Thank you.
Eva, I am Ieaving.
Oh yes.
Can I say something?
I am very happy here.
At Ieast I am with him.
- Sure.
Fuhrer wiII feeI good if

To the Fuhrer.
- To the Fuhrer!
And your beauty.
Okay, goodbye.
My Fuhrer!
AIbert. Happy to see you.
During our Iast meeting
I feIt maybe it's our Iast time...
But I appreciate that
you came here to me.
My Fuhrer, I came
here to bid you goodbye.
I didn't carry out your orders.
I couIdn't destroy BerIin.
After aII, how couId I
destroy my own creation?
PIease try to understand me.
You are betraying me
at this fragiIe moment.
You wiII be punished for it.
Yes.
I know that.
Here is my resignation.
You feIt bad.
Look, you are tired of working.
You need some rest.
Sit down.
You can dismiss me,
I don't want speciaI treatment.
I thought you are a smart..
..IoyaI and an optimistic person.
My Fuhrer.
You want to Ieave?
Yes. I...I wiII have to go.
You too, Speer?
- Yes.
Look after yourseIf, My Fuhrer.
Goodbye.
My Fuhrer, this is the
new modeI of BerIin City.
It's been designed just Iike
the way you envisioned it to be.
ReaIIy, it's very beautifuI.
Just Iike I wanted.
Do you know, Speer,
why you are my best architect?
My Fuhrer...
You aIways turn my
imagination into reaIity.'
Thank you, My Fuhrer.
This is the centraI haII.
Its piIIars are 50 feet taII.
- This one?
Yes. And this is the dome.
It starts at 100 feet and
wiII extend up to 240 feet.
Unique and styIish.
- ReaIIy.
Our city wiII be very beautifuI.
More spectacuIar than Paris.
Just Iike I wanted!
But My Fuhrer, this
construction wiII be expensive.
Don't worry about that.
Just start the work.
Great, My Fuhrer.
'It seems Iike you are
not receiving my Ietters.'
'I feeI compIeteIy Iost
without you.'
'I am IoneIy.'
'Strange thoughts poIIute my mind.'
'It wouId be so nice if you
couId come back to India..
..before something
terribIe happens.'
'Everything is fine back home.'
'We had a good harvest this year.'
'And yes, I am
trying to get Mr. Rehmat..
..to fix the back waII of
the house before the monsoon.'
'It compIeteIy coIIapsed
Iast year during the rains.'
'Your son doesn't eat anything..
..without cIarified butter
and miIk.'
'Mother and father
are absoIuteIy fine.'
'They have grown sIightIy weak.'
'Dear, can't you come back soon?'
'I can't force you,
after aII, you are my husband.'
'I don't know what to write next.'
'I pray to the Iord
for your safety.'
'Yours, Amrita.'
'Yours, Sarita.'
If this wouId have been some Zeenat,
Tarannum or KhaIida..
..then you wouIdn't have
abandoned her Iike this.
Brother Himmat,
it's best that you..
..keep your nonsense to yourseIf.
Nonsense!
It might be nonsense for you,
but it is the truth.
Look, brother Himmat,
I won't toIerate it again.
What can you do?
What can you do?
Are you threatening me?
Enough!
Enough.
What is going on?
What is going on?
With great hopes,
with great expectations,
I had joined the Azad Hind Fauj.
I thought I wiII Iiberate India.
And when I wiII return
to my country,
my peopIe wiII be proud of me.
They wiII be proud of us.
An abIe Ieader Iike
Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose
wiII meet our peopIe.
This, that and what not.
But aII my hopes were shattered.
And what did we get?
What?
This dangerous jungIe,
this trodden path.
Hunger, sickness, anguish!
I was born with such iII-Iuck.
Am I not fiIIed with rage?
I am fiIIed with rage as weII.
But this doesn't mean that..
..you point your gun
at your own brother!
Stop! Hey! Stop!
- HeIp.
Stop!
- HeIp.
HeIp!
- Take her away. - HeIp.
Go. Go. Go.
Go.
Himmat. In the front.
Here, Shakir.
Is anyone in there?
- There is no one here, brother.
That way.
PaI, they were
supposed to be very rich.
But why were they so
stingy in regards to food?
This is not India.
I reaIIy feeI Iike
eating some fish and rice.
It's been ages.
But we can't heIp it.
We are so far away.
Not even the aroma of
our food reaches here.
Brother, onIy if I couId my hands..
..on some corn
fIatbread and mustard curry!
I swear, you can make
me do anything you want.
Brother BaIbir, you heard that?
You can make him do
whatever you want to.
And as far as your
wish of corn fIatbread..
..and mustard curry is concerned,
I wiII fuIfiII that, Hanuman.
HeIp.
HeIp.
HeIp.
Hanuman. Shakir.
Brother BaIbir, Vivek?
Brother BaIbir, it's...weII...
What happened?
Himmat is nowhere to be seen.
Go to sIeep, foIks.
He must be sitting here
somewhere among the rocks,
with a pot in his hand.
This is not the time to joke.
Look over there. That way.
Himmat!
Himmat!
Himmat! Himmat! Himmat!
What happened?
- French soIdiers kiIIed him.
And with me...
Himmat.
'Dear Amrita,'
'Today I feeI Iike I am
compIeteIy shattered.'
'Now I am just fighting
with myseIf.'
'This is reaIIy tough.'
'It is notjust me.
The rest of my friends too
are going through the
same circumstances.'
'I am the eIdest of them aII.'
'That is why it tougher for me
to deaI with these circumstances.'
'I just hope to reach India.'
'My beIief is compIeteIy shaken.'
'On one hand I see
your face, our chiId.'
'And on the other hand
I see my five friends.'
'I shouIdn't be caIIing
them friends, but brothers.'
'I just don't understand
what I shouId write further.'
'Just pray to God.'
'Yours, BaIbir.'
Brother BaIbir.
Brother BaIbir.
How did this happen?
Brother BaIbir.
''Those who are gone don't know..''
''When they wiII return
after achieving victory..''
''..they won't find anything.''
''When they wiII return
after achieving victory..''
''..they won't find anything.''
''There wiII be empty Ianes.''
My Fuhrer, the Russians are at a
distance of 500 meters from us.
We don't have the ammunition
or the manpower to fight them.
We wiII fight back.
TaIk to HimmIer.
- Yes, My Fuhrer.
Check on Steiner.
What situation is he in?
Inform Wencke.
We wiII fight back.
''There wiII be empty Ianes.''
''There wiII be broken homes.''
''There wiII be terrified chiIdren.''
''There wiII be grieving mothers.''
Sorry to disturb you, My Fuhrer.
But this is an urgent news.
HimmIer, my most trusted man.
He is making a deaI in
coIIaboration with the enemy.
He wants to become the Fuhrer!
Go. Bury him aIive, wherever he is.
Go!
HimmIer has gone missing,
My Fuhrer.
Hermann. Hermann
FegeIein must know. Go.
He too hasn't been in the bunker
for the past few days.
He too is not there.
What do you mean?
He is aIso missing.
Go. Go, shoot him down.
Go find him. Go.
He is a traitor.
And I aIso know that
your sister is pregnant.
PIease spare Hermann.
What wiII happen to my sister?
I have no mercy for traitors.
PIease, My Fuhrer.
This is my order.
How dare you?!
CarefuI. CarefuI.
Hanuman, you guys move on.
I'II be right back.
- Where to, brother?
I too want to take a Ieak.
No. No. Move on with them.
But brother, I too need
to take a Ieak urgentIy.
Hanuman, who is oIder between us?
You, brother. You.
Then..
- Okay, brother.
Hanuman? Hanuman?
Hanuman? Hanuman?
Hanuman?
Speak up.
GopaI,..
PIease Ieave me
aIone for some time.
No.
Babu...
Why isn't Steiner attacking?
Why isn't he attacking?
I want the information.
My Fuhrer, the Russian
army is very Iarge in number.
Large in number?!
Those who fear defeat are afraid
of an army which is Iarge in number.
The person who has a
fervour for victory within him,
he aIone is equaI to miIIions.
Go and teII this to Steiner.
Steiner has refused to attack.
Because he is onIy Ieft
with a few starving civiIians.
He has refused?!
My orders have not been
carried out.
Now my orders...
I am caIIed Fuhrer, but no one
shows me respect, obeys me!
My orders were defied!
I was deceived!
You aII have cheated me.
AII of you!
My army, my officers,
everyone has cheated me.
You aII are worthIess,
useIess, good-for-nothing feIIows!
You didn't take any
action and now those
Russians have reached BerIin.
Our Iast man is
fighting tiII his Iast breath.
A Iie! A big Iie!
Your man wiII fight
tiII his Iast breath?!
You aII are worthIess, useIess,
and cowardIy!
My Fuhrer, you can't
caII my soIdiers cowards.
Of course! Of course I wiII! You
are aII impotent. Good-for-nothing!
The worst army of the worId!
- My Fuhrer!
Don't caII me Fuhrer!
Don't caII me that.
You may aII go wherever you Iike.
Anyone may do whatever they Iike.
If you aII are thinking that
I wiII run away from BerIin,
then it is your misunderstanding.
I wiII die. I wiII commit suicide,..
..but I wiII never Ieave BerIin!
Two...two at
a time wiII go that side.
Shakir!
Hey! You aII run from here! Run!
Go!
Go!
Cowards die many
times before their death.
The vaIor never cares of death.
But once, of aII the wonders,
that I get hurt.. It seems to me..
..most strange that men
shouId fear.. seeing their death..
..a necessary end, wiII
come when it wiII come.
Okay, kids, it's time to go to bed.
Take them to their room.
I heard about Steiner.
I want to remind my
husband about our decision.
My Fuhrer, Magda and I have decided
to stay with you aIong with..
..our chiIdren tiII the Iast moment.
Thank you, doctor.
Papa.
Oh yeah!
I wanted to go out, but soIdier
uncIe didn't aIIow me to do so.
There is big danger outside,
son. There is big danger.
I am not scared. You too go out.
My brave son, if it was in my hands,
I wouId have pIayed with
you here the entire day.
Why can't you be with us?
I have a Iot of work.
Come on, go to sIeep now.
I am not feeIing sIeepy.
I wiII make you go to sIeep.
Come on, sIeep now.
Come on, go to sIeep.
At Ieast you Iove the kids.
I Iove you too very much, Magda.
You must've Ioved once..
..but now you don't get much
time away from actresses..
..and others' wives.
If you hadn't tried to cage
me I wouId've tried to escape.
Love can't tied down, Magda.
Say you can't be tied down.
You are getting me wrong again.
And for this very reason
your first marriage broke off.
Thanks for reminding me that,
Joseph.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's not your mistake.
Anyway, I am happy that we are
aII together at the Iast moment.
Goodnight, Joseph.
Goodnight.
Cheers!
- Cheers!
Cheers!
- Cheers!
Eva..
Everyone has deceived me.
I am there with you, My Fuhrer.
Do you know..
..why I didn't marry you?
No.
Because my first Iove
was my country.
Germany.
I didn't want to
give you her pIace.
I don't have any
compIaints from you, My Fuhrer.
I can understand.
Eva, wiII you marry me?
'Dear friend, That I address
you as a friend is no formaIity.'
'I own no foes.'
'We have no doubt
about your bravery,
or devotion to your fatherIand.'
'Nor do we beIieve
that you are the monster,
described by your opponents.'
'But your own
writings and pronouncements
Ieave no room for doubt that
many of your acts are monstrous,
and unbecoming of human dignity.'
'Your humiIiation of CzechosIovakia,
the rape of PoIand, and
the swaIIowing of Denmark
are acts degrading humanity.'
'Our resistance to it does not
mean harm to the British peopIe.'
'We seek to convert them, not to
defeat them on the battIefieId.'
'The ruIers may have
our Iand and bodies,..
..but not our souIs.'
'If not the British, some
other power wiII certainIy
improve upon your method, and
beat you with your own weapon.'
'You are Ieaving no
Iegacy to your peopIe of which
they wiII feeI proud.'
'Your sincere friend, M.K. Gandhi.'
'I..
..had joined this army as a soIdier
during the First WorId War.'
'It's been more than
30 years since then.'
'AII my actions,
aII the decisions which were taken..
..were done keeping the weII
being of my countrymen in mind.'
'The peopIe of Germany
have given me the strength..
..to Iive, serve and
fight for them.'
Do you accept Miss.
Eva Brown as your wife?
Of course!
'I never wanted this
war to take pIace.'
'This war has been forced upon us.'
'I know..
..that after my death,
historians wiII paint me as..
..a predator
in the pages of history.'
Now I pronounce
you husband and wife.
'It is my thinking..
..that European countries
are being traded Iike stocks,
and the Jews are responsibIe
for it.'
'I had aIready said that
if this war takes pIace,
miIIions of men, women and
chiIdren of Europe wiII be kiIIed,
and the criminaIs wiII
go unpunished.'
'Germany wiII be
divided into two parts,
so that it can never
raise its head again.'
You hoId my gIass. Oh,
'I want to thank aII those peopIe..
- God, I am so happy.
Hey!
- ..who have supported me...'
Cheers, everyone.
Everybody!
'After my death,
I appoint Dr. GoebbeIs
as the chanceIIor of Third Reich.'
'Instead of bowing my head,
I wouId Iike to be beheaded,
for the sake of my country.'
Of course, how can I forget?
There's a secret
passage to get out of here.
PIease Ieave as soon as possibIe.
Dinner was good.
We don't have much time.
We have been
surrounded from aII sides.
I don't want to
surrender myseIf to the enemies,
and make a mockery of myseIf.
I can run.
But I won't run.
If I run I wiII
stay aIive physicaIIy,
but what about my souI?
Your decision is my decision,
My Fuhrer.
Just one request.
When your soIdiers..
..carry my body out,
I don't want to Iook ugIy.
I just got married
just a few hours ago.
And bIood stains on my face...
I am sorry, but...
Gunsche.
- My Fuhrer.
After I die...
burn our dead bodies.
I won't be abIe to do that.
I don't want my enemies
to Iay their hands
even on our dead bodies.
But, My Fuhrer...
- That's my order.
Yes.
My Fuhrer.
This fur coat is for you.
Fuhrer personaIIy gave it to me.
It wiII suit you weII.
I can't Ieave you
peopIe in such a condition.
Dr. GoebbeIs and his wife
and chiIdren are aIso there.
I am not an outsider that I wouId..
- Shut up!
Go, enjoy your Iife.
And be happy.
Just go.
You are Germany's bravest mother.
- My Fuhrer.
You have made this the most
beautifuI moment of my Iife.
''..then what are we crying for?''
''Lost the kingdom.
Lost the throne.''
''We Iost 'yesterday'.
We Iost even 'today'.''
''A dream has shattered.''
''A sense of power has crashed.''
''What you sow is what you reap.''
''This is the ruIe of the nature.''
''There wiII be terrified chiIdren.''

''There wiII be grieving mothers.''

Chirag comes from a wealthy background and assists his father, Siddharth Mehra, in managing and maintaining their land. Chirag's parents have been divorced due to incompatibility arising mainly due to his businesswoman mother, Shalini's hatred of tennis, a sport that Chirag wants to play professionally.

Shalini and Siddharth would like to see Chirag married, and accordingly, Shalini picks London-based Kamiah, while Siddharth picks Bathinda-based Manjeet Ahluwalia. Chirag, who sneaks off to practice tennis at night, is asked to make a choice but informs them that he is in love with a model named Anishka. The displeased couple decides to confront and put pressure on a struggling and unknowing klutz-like Anishka to leave their son alone, but they fail.

In the end, Chirag's parents realize their mistake and together attend Chirag's tennis match and give blessings to Chirag and Anishka.",902,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt2104937.srt","We're standing outside

This noise, this crowd and

Today's match might
just be a game for viewers.
But I know...
...today my
competition is with my own fate.
I can not win till my aim
comes true related to this game...
...which I've started 16 years ago.
Chirag! You didn't sleep yet.
Come on, come on.
- Good shot.
Chirag, you come and stand
here after school?
You've a lot of
interest in this game.
Yes, sir.
Want to learn?
- Yes, sir.
Good. Get your racquet.
It's kid's nature...
...if you stop them from
something they'll insist to do that...
And maybe that was
happening with me too.
Chirag, very good.
Back hand swing.
Very good.
After each day my
game was improving.
Everyone was happy, but my
destination was very far.
What's the big deal?
If I'll try 10-15 times then
I'll make 8-10 shots, correct.
Okay, come.
What?
- Quiet. Stand straight.
Chirag! You're being
serious, I was just joking.
But I'm serious.
If you'll hit the ball
somewhere else then I'll be in trouble.
Do you understand?
- Shut up and don't move.
It's just a game for you
but it's a matter of my life.
Stand straight.
Okay. Aim at that can.
Good shot!

How did it happen?
He didn't sleep well nor

If he'll work in 2
shifts then it will happen.
It's not his age

Then what else he'll do?
He's doing because he want

You'll marry with
that illeterate girl.
Chirag! If it will

But there is nothing like that.
What the...
Mom. Dad.
Why did you call me here?
If you wanted to talk to me
then you could talk to me at home.
No! Because I wanted to
talk both of you together.
And it's not possible at your
banglow nor at your farm house.
You can keep any guest in
your house for the lifetime...
I've no problem with that.
But please don't
attach them with my life.
I don't want to get married now.
I've to make my career first...
...as a tennis player.
I know everything...
You supposed to go for practise...
You went to play the
match, You lied to me.
I was helpless.
I can understand
what problem has occured...
...between you because of tennis
But I love this game.
I want to play tennis.
Fine. On one condition.
Say yes for Kamya.
What?!
- Not at all.
He'll only marry with Manjit.
My son will take this decision.
Don't listen to her.
She'll ruin your life.
Don't spoil your life like this.
I didn't come
here to insult myself.
And even I've not
come to see sunset.
Will you both stop
and listen to me.
To make both of you happy
I can't marry with both of them.
I would've some
girl in my life whom...
Whom I loved.
Do you love someone?
There is some girl in your life.
Who is she?
Who is she?
That...
She's that girl.
I love this girl.
You've created a nice blunder.
Do you think your problem will
be solved if you shit in hotel?
I don't know.
But at least we'll be rid
of Kamya and Manjit's matter.
I can't handle this anymore.
Chirag, suppose if for your
happiness your parents...
...agree to let you
marry the girl you love...
...what will you do?
Where will you find that girl?
Forget address, you don't even
know the name of that girl.
First of all, it won't happen.
Do you think they'll
agree for something?
You can keep anyone as guest
in your house all your life...
...but don't try to
link them to my life.
There can be a girl
in my life whom I love.

and came to Mumbai.
And since that day you're
working in small ad films.
Excuse me?
Either it's modeling
or film industry...
...here girl's careers
are very short.
That's why they keep trying
to have relationship...
...with a successful man...
...that's why you've chosen Chirag.
Chirag?
Shalini Mehra's son Chirag Mehra.
He's the only heir of
Multi Millionaire Empire.
You already know that.
What are you saying?
Cut the crap, young lady.
I'm giving you an advice...
Stay away from my son's life.
Or else you and your career...
I'll wipe it off like this.
Okay?
Who was she?
Shalini Mehra!
- Who is Shalini Mehra?
I don't know.
- And why was she scolding you?
I don't know.
And who is this Chirag Mehra?
- How would I know that?
Madam, we're out of gas.
- Get it filled.
But money...
- Does money grow on tree?
My mood is ruined.
I'll phone later. Yes, I'm home.
Madam, some sir came to meet you.
Sir? Who?
I don't know. He said he
has important work with you.
Give me water.
- Okay.
He didn't tell you his name.
- I forgot to ask.
But he's waiting
for you in the lobby.
Excuse me.
Yes.
- You're here to see me?
Yes.
Please. Sit.
Tell me.
I don't know how to start...
...actually I learnt
about Chirag and you...
...when decision of
his life was made.
Hmm!
Chirag?
Chirag is my son.
Oh... okay. Okay.
So what were you
saying about Chirag?
I've fixed Chirag's marriage
with my friend's daughter.
He won't go against my decision.
So I came to request you...
To get out of his life. Right?
I won't...
I won't get out of Chirag's life.
You can do what you want!
Chirag.
Good Chirag! Very good.
- Thank you, sir.
I'm playing but you're panting.
Play... play more...
Look at the result of your game!
Aunt created a commotion
on Anishka's set.
And media published
the news adding gossips.
You're stuck! Mr. Chirag!
Why are you smiling?
Tara.
No. I don't know
anything and you won't...
...phone me about this. Please.
Great.
You're on laptop and I'm
tired of answering the phone.
It's becoming a big scandal.
This Chirag and Shalini
Mehra... who are they?
This is just the half story.
- Meaning?
I mean his father reached home.
- What?
Mother is threatening
and father is requesting...
...to get out of his son's life.
When I'm not in his
life, how can I get out?
Point.
Hello.
- Hello, Anishka.
Chirag Mehra speaking.
I wanted to meet you.
I see. So now you want to meet me.
- Yes, why?
I've met your parents and I'm
not interesting in meeting you.
But Anishka...
- Listen carefully, Chirag Mehra.
If you try to harass me,
I'll be severe on you.
What do we do now?
I don't understand.
We're homeless because
of Kamya and Manjit.
How can do you intend
to stay in this hotel?
I don't know.
Master...
What's the next move?
It's the same.
I've to meet Anishka.
It's his phone.
- Wait. Listen. Relax.
Listen to me carefully.
Just meet him once. Talk to him.
You should know the real story.
Come on now...
Papa, my birthday cake.
Oh no...
Hi.
Whenever we meet something
goes wrong. Right?
And you're the reason for it.
Can I know why you and
your parents after my life?
I'm sorry, Anishka.
It wasn't deliberate.
But now I feel everything
is happening is fine.
Meaning?
I mean...
...I don't know how to say.
Okay, I'll say it straight.
What will you take to spend 15
- 20 days with me?
Anishka. What happened?
Will you tell me?
What does he think of himself?
He might be rich but...
Anishka. Listen.
What's the problem?
It's a matter of 15-20 days.
He's ready to pay you price.
I think it's a very good deal.
You should make some money.
Page 3 for women.
Cut it. Fantastic. Very good.
Next shot, Anishka.
Make up.
I don't need any white spots.
Sir. Sir.
Sir has phoned to
pack up the shooting.
I'm ready for the shot.
Anishka, shooting is cancelled.
Why is the shooting cancelled?
What's the problem?
Shalini Mehra.
What does she has to do with my shoot?
- Anishka.
Shalini Mehra gives us business...
...of 200 Crore rupees every year.
We campaign for her 12 products.
You got involved in a
controversy with her son.
Sir, media writes anything. They...
Anishka. I'll have to replace
you from all my ad campaign.
You can not do that.
Your agency has a
legal contract with me.
Mr. Batra, you can't do this to me.
I'll drag your agency to court.
I won't spare you and
that Shalini Mehra.
Answer the phone.
No use. Some shoot must
have been cancelled again...
...or some agency must've
phoned to cancel your agreement.
Anishka. All this is happening
because of that Chirag.
You've no choice.
So listen to me and
accept his offer.
Yes. He said he's very rich.
He's ready to pay any price.
So let's fleece him.
Ah...
What happened?
Nothing. I'm tense.
Don't be tense. I'm here
to handle everything.
Really?
She's here.
Hi. Nice to see you again.
Hi. I'm Avnit.
Her business manager.
Hi.
- So you can talk to me.
Okay.
Please.
So what's your proposal?
Actually...
Proposal is that for 2-3 weeks
she has to be with Chirag.
Meaning?
I'll tell you...
For a few days she
has to do a drama...
...to pretend that we're
lovers. That's all.
But why?
There are two problems.
Okay. How many days for the days?
I think...
Be precise.
20 days. From tomorrow.
What will be your fees?
20 Lakh rupees.
- 20 Lakh...
...for 20 days.
Per day.
It's okay.
No problem.
I've to get used to it.
Anyways, I agree.
Often we get oblivious.
The heart shouldn't be lost.
Who knows when desires
will be kindled?
Who knows when
seasons will change?
Hearts knows not
how love happens.
When eyes are locked...
dreams are woven.
When someone accompanies us,
he seems to be a dear one.
When eyes are locked...

We've reached your house.
Thank you for the lift.
- You're welcome.
See you tomorrow.
- Okay. Anishka, I forgot...
This is a gift for you.
You got a gift for me.
Band aids.
You keep needing them.
It happens only
when you're with me.
But I'll keep it.
I didn't do anything.
I'm fine.
When we keep talking
of each other...
...the aura is filled with bliss.
When you'll be in love,
you'll be restless.
Who knows when desires
will be kindled?
Who knows when
seasons will change?
Hearts knows not
how love happens.
When eyes are locked...
dreams are woven.
When someone accompanies us,
he seems to be a dear one.
He'll come closer
one day, believe it.
The heart is crazy
and unrestrained.
Trust it.
Who knows when desires

Hearts knows not

When someone accompanies us,
he seems to be a dear one.
Are you fine, Anishka?
Be careful!
- I'm already careful!
Did I get astray?
I didn't know that...
...I'll enjoy this affair act.
I even forgot that there
is an end of this drama...
But there is a problem.
- What?
I practised with you.
Now where can I
find a boy like you?
Yeah...
- Anishka.
Mom.
The work for which
I was here is over.
Yes, mom. I'm all set to leave.
I'll call you when my return
ticket will be confirmed.
No, mom. I'm absolutely all right.
Just missing you. That's all.
I love you, mom. Okay. Bye.
You've decided to go back.
And you didn't even tell me.
There is no more
reason to stay here.
What are you doing?
I've applied in Multi
National Company for a job.
So I got my appointment letter.
Which address you've told them?
It was my mistake
that I thought that...
...this house will
be your new address.
I really don't want to...
But I'm staying for that friend...
Whose own son left the house.
I can't leave him alone like this...
And I won't left my dad alone...
And won't go anywhere.
Hey... let's celebrate.
Come on.
Oh... relax, Pratik. Take it easy.
No. Today is the celebration day...
Today we've booked
the entire hotel.
Our friend got freedom today,
Kamia and Manjeet's
chapter is closed.
Your all problems are
solved, Congratulations!
Why you're sitting so quite?
Please smile.
Cheers.
Anishka, the credit goes to you.
You've done great acting
of being his girlfriend,
Superb.
Once I felt she's
actually in love with him.
Nobody could think
she was only acting.
Everything looked so
real. Everyone got fooled.
You both looked so much in love.
What a performance!
That's a good performance.
You're great. Superb!
Excuse me.
Why did you come here?
Just like that.
Pratik is a crazy guy.
He says anything.
By the way, only I know the truth.
I know. You've tolerated me a lot.
I'm feeling addicted to you
after living so long with you.
I really enjoyed your company.
Anyways...
Can I call you sometime?
Will you come with me
for coffee or dinner?
Can't we extend this agreement?
Till the end of this life!
The one I found... the one
who dwells in my eyes...
The one I found... the one
who dwells in my eyes...
...she has come in my arms.
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.
Maybe we had to meet.
We had to write this
exciting love saga.
Wait and watch what
will happen now...
When you're with me,
we can reach the sky.
Your words are magical.
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.
Songs echo in the air.
The season is romantic
and the world seems new.
This is the effect of love.
When heart is in love,
everything looks beautiful.
In moonlit night...
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.
What are you thinking?
First time my parent's
fight gave me something.
And that's you Anishka.
So that means I should
be thankful to them.
Yeah.
But it's my bad luck...
...I can't share my
happiness with them.
Next week I'm going to
play my final match...
I'm very close to my life goal.
But this time my family won't
be with me to appreciate me.
Will you listen to me, Chirag?
Sidhu.
- Pal.
Ask him what he came to prove?
I didn't come to prove anything.
I just came to apologize
to uncle Dharam and Manjit.
You all are responsibility
for all this.
Anishka.
The girl I didn't even
know is everything for me.
I love Anishka.
I want to marry her.
But I won't do it
without your wish.
I don't want after marriage...
...we should have only
court's marriage certificate.
I want blessings of
my dad and mom too.
I'm sure you won't refuse.
I want to share my
happiness with both of you.
With my mom and dad.
For me... for your son...
...will you make mom agree.
Please.
Friend, where are you going?
In life your son has asked for
something for the first time.
Won't you listen to him?
You don't have to
go to any stranger.
She's your wife.
Please go, friend.
It's possible, this is the
way for estranged to unite.
Friend, don't worry about us.
We don't choose
destiny and matches.
It's made in heaven.
Correct, father.
Anyway, they look so nice.
Made for each other.
Come.
Come, son.
Don't look like this.
Won't you bless them?
Enough.
Come, son.
Thank you, Dharampal.
Come in.
- Madam, it's sir.
Who?
Your sir...
Make him sit. I'm coming.
Okay.
Please. Sit down.
Shalini. Didn't I
disturb you at this hour?
The reason for your arrival
can disturb, not you.
Shalini, we've passed our lives,
whether it was good or bad.
But now it's question of our son.
Chirag came to me...
...with Anishka.
He loves Anishka and wants
to spend his life with her.
She's a nice girl.
I'm glad to hear that.
So go ahead.
You don't mind?
Sidharth, will you use
my son to win against me?
I never thought that.
What?
Are you the same who brought his...
...friend's daughter seeing Kamya.
And when Chirag rejected her too...
...now you've accepted
that soap called...
...model your
daughter- in- law.
Great.
Actually you're favoring my
son to make him go against me.
You're getting me wrong.
Absolutely not. I'm not wrong.
I know my son, his
nature better than you.
And that girl doesn't
deserve my son.
But Chirag...
- I've given my decision.
Would you please excuse me now.
Chirag.
I tried my best.
But your mother...
didn't agree for it.
Don't worry, son. I'm with you.
Chirag.
Chirag, everyone
is looking for you.
Why won't you answer my phone?
Chirag. Phone me urgent.
Call me back.
Chirag, where are you?
You won't answer any
phone or reply my message.
Everyone is worried. Where are you?
Please phone me.
I'm waiting for your call.
Sidharth, where is Chirag?
He won't come for practice.
Only 2 days are
left for Final match.
All the formalities are left.
Doesn't he want to play the match?
Do you hear me?
I don't know anything.
What are you saying?
The truth. Chirag
isn't to be found.
He won't answer mine,
Anishka or uncle's phone.
He didn't go for
practice for a week.
Aunt, he did everything
to reach this Final.
And today when it's the time...
Aunt, please. Do something.
Chirag.
Yes. Why did you call me?
Chirag, you know everyone
is worried for you.
Why are you doing this?
I don't know.
You've the right to take
the decision of your life.
If your happiness
lies with Anishka...
...so be it.
I don't mind, Chirag.
But how can you take the credit
by giving what's not yours?
Chirag.
Of course. I'm tired.
I'm tired of thinking
who is right or...
...who is wrong between my parents.
Who loves me more
and who loves me less.
Chirag.
What are you saying?
Yes, mom. This is the truth.
But you never realized it.
You're happy thinking you've
given everything to your son.
Dad was always worried that
your luxuries will ruin me.
I've lived two different
lives because of you.
But it's enough.
Let's end it.
I want nothing.
Neither you nor dad nor tennis.
Just think that dad
lost in the arena...
...and your son lost before.
I won't tell you to sit, Shalini.
Because I'm sure that
our meeting won't be long.
Don't waste time.
Sidharth, what's time...
...we've ruined our lives.
But today our son is on
the verge of destruction.
Our son... you're saying this.
You've fought a battle all
your life to make him yours.
What is lacking that only a
father can provide not a mother?
Talkin Cinema with Karan Adarsh.
People of India and UK...
Chirag.
If you'll play and lose
so you'll be a winner,
But if you'll give up and lose...
Then you'll never
forgive your self.
Do you know Anishka?
Why did I play Tennis?
Because my dad give up.
And I've decided that...
I'll make him win from my victory.
And I'll show my
victory trophy to my mom.
Now for who I'll play.
Chirag! For those people with
whom you've no relationship.
But they still came
to watch your game...
They feel happy,
they applause for you...
In those viewers where
your parents aren't there...
But there are many
parents over there...
...who are watching you playing...
And told their kids...
That play like Chirag.
Good evening to you,
ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Pune Tennis stadium.
You're about to witness
the final of the...
Yes, Vikram. Audience are
impatient for this match.
It's between defending
champion Mahesh...
...and upcoming star Chirag Mehra.
Vikram, this match has
been in controversy...
...because of Chirag Mehra.
Before the match there were
questions is he'll play or not.
Ladies and gentlemen
the wait is finally over...
and the players make their way
from the dressing room to the court.
And listen to the crowd as
they cheer for both the players.
We see the first sign of
competition as Mahesh Singh...
...and Chirag Mehra give
each other a cold flare.
Players come on the
court for the toss.
Just look at Mahesh not taking
the eyes of the opponent.
Telling Chirag Mehra the
challenger to the crown that...
...you've to bring out your
best game or you're done.
Chirag wins the toss
and choses to serve.
What should Chirag
do to win the match?
I think Chirag will have
to be more aggressive...
...take his chances
and hope for the best.
Most important, he should be
confident and mentally strong.
And Chirag ready to serve.
Mahesh smashes the ball
into Chirag's body...
...and Chirag is unable
to handle the ball.
First blood! Champion Mahesh
Singh gets love 15.Iove
What a good passing shot!
Mahesh looking come to the net.
And finish the point... Chirag...
The Chirag comes out with
answer with his own.
The first game goes
to Chirag Mehra.
Again Chirag changes
the direction of...
...the ball and Mahesh
can't return it.
Chirag Mehra is playing with
innovative and aggressiveness...
...and leading the first set by 52.
Chirag has started
strongly and he has...
...to maintain his momentum through.
A great passing shot by
Chirag of his back hand.
Chirag Mehra. 60. 15.
That's a commendable job.
And I think if he
continues in this spirit...
...there is nothing stopping
him from winning this match.
We got a nice set to watch...
Chirag had an answer
of every short...
And Chirag won the
first set of the match.
And here it begins the second set...
Mahesh Singh serves.
What a serve!
Mahesh Singh has started
the set aggressively.
Chirag. Focus.
Chirag has to do something
or else he'll lose this set.
He's not able to
concentrate the way he...
...was concentrating
in the first set.
Why we felt that something
is bothering Chirag...
It seems he's losing his focus.
I think he needs to get
his focus back again.
And he's already trailing 1-4
in the second set.
One more...
What are we seeing here?
I think this is
absolutely uncalled...
...for in the good game of tennis.
It reminds me of John McNore when...
...he used to argue with the umpire.
It's not like him.
Chirag is very calm by nature.
It's not good to argue with umpire.
I think he should just
focus of his game...
...take control of himself
and just move on with it.
That's double fault. The
second set goes to Mahesh Singh.
And we're not level
with one set a piece.
If Chirag plays with the
form of his first set...
...things can turn.
Maybe the change of racket
will bring him some luck.
Chirag is lagging in
the third set as well.
Never double fault.
Chirag needs to improve on his serve
which has gone from bad to worse.
Chirag!
You can do it, son.
Oh God! Chirag can't handle
Mahesh's forehand pace.
Third set is 4-2 to Mahesh Singh.
And Chirag is making
come back in the match.
Everybody is looking for a
fight and a competitive match.
Quiet please.
That was a bad ball.
I think Chirag was wrong footed
and he has twisted his ankle.
We hope that won't be very serious.
Physio is there at such an
interesting point in the game...
...you know I mean...
- The score is levelled at 6 all.
Injury is on the
deciding tie break.
Chirag is up. He'll
begin the tie break.
7 points will win. The tie
break will decide the match.
Quiet please.
1 to Mahesh Singh.
One more body shot. Mahesh
started aggressively in tie break.
Exciting match. Chirag is
making a comeback in this game.
That's another second hand by
Chirag. Match point to Chirag.
What an amazing turn
around to the game!
It's a nail biting finish.
Now we've reached to
that moment where...
...we'll get our next champion.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the match point.
I understand the
differences between...
...you and dad because of tennis.
But I love this game.
I want to play tennis.
I'll make them win with my win.
I'll show the trophy to mom.
We've a new champion
ladies and gentlemen.
Our new all India tennis
champion. Chirag Mehra.
Well done, son.
Mom...
I love you, son.
Congratulations.
Anishka!
Congratulation!
Chirag won the match.
I've won both the games.
I have found the one
who dwells in my eyes.
I have found the one
who dwells in my eyes.
...she has come in my arms.
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.
Slowly and slowly it
happens, this is love.
Maybe we had to meet.
We had to write this
exciting love saga.
Wait and watch what
will happen now...

Aakash Rana is an illegal immigrant married to British-Indian citizen Nikita, who lives as a successful engineer. He is eventually caught and deported from the UK, thus crushing his dreams of an ideal life.

Four years later, Aakash returns with a vengeance on his mind and teams up with his former employees Aadil Khan and Megha to wreak some havoc. What follows is a bomb threat on a train and a tense railway control officer, Sanjay Raina, and anti-terrorism officer, Arjun Khanna, trying every trick in the book to avert the disaster and to apprehend the culprits. Sanjay Raina tries his best to save his daughter Piya, and the passengers in the train who are thrown in the mix are police officer Shivan Menon and his team of police force, who are escorting a prisoner on the same ill-fated train. Aakash demands 10 million euros to tell them how to disarm the bomb. The ministry does not want to give the money, but Khanna convinces them that the money will be given back and is a way to lure the terrorists.

After following Aakash's instructions and dropping the money in a river, he walks away. Megha gets the money and tries to get away. She evades the cops after a vicious chase, but unfortunately, she is killed by a van in an intersection. Khanna finds out that Khan is one of the bombers and chases him. Khan is shot in the leg, but he gets away after jumping from the bridge and landing on a jet ski driven by Aakash. Aakash once again demands money and asks it to be left in a dustbin. The dustbin falls inward, and Aakash runs away with the money even though the police attempt to pursue him.

Khanna and his team find out where Aadil is and go to arrest him. Aadil commits suicide with a bomb, almost killing Khanna. Aakash calls Raina and tells him that a note has been left at a restaurant called Delhi Darbar that tells how to defuse the bomb. However, the restaurant catches on fire, and the letter is burnt. Aakash visits Nikita and his son, and they arrange to fly out of the UK that night. Khanna visits Nikita and tells her who her husband is. After changing the plan (that they should leave the UK via train because the police have found out about his plan of leaving via plane), he goes to the train station. There he sees a video of Raina asking the bomber to call again as the letter was burnt.

Aakash calls Raina and tells him that the bomb was not connected to the wheels and the train will not explode if stopped. Raina stops the train and everyone disembarks safely. Nikita, who is helping Khanna now, goes to the train station and sees Aakash and the news that the bomb threat was a hoax. Khanna pursues her and demands she tell him where Aakash is so that he can catch him. Nikita convinces Khanna that it was not Aakash that she saw. Khanna refuses to believe her lies and convinces her that Aakash is a bomber and this is the only time she can save the passengers. She tells him that he is lying to her again because the bomb in the train was a rumor and everyone is safe. Khanna tells her that she is actually helping a criminal, but she doesn't believe him because so many people's lives have been ruined by that law. She lets Aakash go, but Khanna finds out as Aakash's son calls him Daddy. Nikita tries to convince Khanna that it's not Aakash, but Khanna, knowing that she is lying, refuses to listen to her and chases him, and they fight. Aakash tells Khanna to let him go and explains why he took such drastic actions. Realizing that Aakash was a victim of deportation and wants to just be with his family again at peace, Khanna stays silent (hinting he will let him leave scot-free). However, the police arrive; after seeing that Aakash had a gun, they shoot him.

In the end, Nikita receives a letter Aakash had written. It stated that the money (which Aakash asked for to defuse the bomb) was in Aakash's bank locker. He also states that she should give half the money to Megha's brother and Adil's mother. He asks her to tell his son that what he did was to get justice. Finally, Aakash tells Nikita that if they ever meet in the next life, the end of their love story will be much better and bids her goodbye.",4164,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt1706317.srt","The jury finds Mr. Aakash Rana
guilty on all accounts.
I just want to present my
side of the story to the court.

Our marriage is not illegal.

returning to UK ever again.
See, I am not a criminal.
I want to take my wife along.
I want justice.
Hi.
Good to see you, sir.
How are you?
Still alive, sir.
But we faced really terrible
days since you left.
Did you get any news?
I've been looking for
it since a long time, sir.
God willing, we'll soon succeed.
Taxi!
This is a garage?
A garage of stolen vehicles.
They don't come here to
get repaired, but disappear.
Steal a car from a
posh locality in London.
Remove the parts and
sell them in the gray market.
All in two hours.
Hey.
Hey.

So far whatever you
did for was for us.
Now it's our turn.
Nowadays,
you don't get respect easily.
You have to snatch it.
I hope we'll get
our share by tomorrow.
He's a combination of
a statesman and a film star.
He's companionate,
enthusiastic, humorous...
...and has a strong
sense of public duty.
That my friends, is Arjun Khanna.
Arjun, I personally feel that
you've decided to retire too early.
It is truly a loss for us, Arjun.
You'll be surely missed
by us and our community.
To Arjun Khanna,
policeman extraordinaire.
Thank you.
Thank you, Levi.
Thank you for saying such
wonderful things about me.
Now, can I have a copy
of the speech, for my in-laws?
In my entire life,
I've realized that...
...there are three things
you should never try to do.
First, never try to kiss
a girl leaning away from you.
Second, never climb a
friend leaning towards you.
And third, never try to
keep such a wonderful gathering...
...away from drinks and fine dine.
So, ladies and gentlemen,
please join me in my memories.
Let's party.
Yeah!
Packed your books?
- Yes.
All of them?
- Yes, of course.
Packed your lunch?
- Yes, Daddy.
Make sure you have it.
Did you call your mother?
Yes.
- What is the pickup time?
I have done it!
Where is your ticket?
Daddy, don't worry.
I'm a big girl now.
I am all grown up now.
Okay, big girl,
I've a surprise for you.
Surprise?
Wow.
A new cell phone.
Thank you, Daddy.
- Here's the charger.
Thank you.
I have added all the contacts.
Just in case. Okay?
Bye, Daddy.
I love you.
- I love you, too.
Go. Go. Go.
- Bye. Yeah.
If you could tell Suzan
to mail final presentations, too.
Come on.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is your co-driver,
Sean Sadler...
...welcoming you to
112 Virgin Train service.
It's this one, sir.
- Thank you.
On our journey today
we will calling at Wigan...
I'm late. Don't say it.
Good morning, sir.
- Morning.
Morning.
- Good morning.
Morning, Rita.
Morning, Leno.
The forces tell me it's
time for me to go home to sleep.
Any updates?
I had a problem on
a train that had stalled...
...under Southampton country line.
I had to diverse some
passengers via Northampton.
Good morning,
Railway control security.
May I help you, please?
Just a moment.
Hello, this is the Railway
Security Chief speaking.
Hello.
There's a bomb on
London-Glasgow 112.
If the speed drops
below 60 the bomb explodes.
Do not stop the train.
Do not stop the train.
Excuse me, sir.
- Yeah?
You are needed inside, urgently.
Yeah. Thanks fine.
Hi, guys.
- Good morning.
Hello, sir.
- Hey, Radhika.
How is your cold?
- Absolutely fine, sir.
We've a situation.
Okay.
Good morning, gentlemen.
So, what's happened?
There's a bomb threat.
- Trigger station?
London-Glasgow.
Train 112.
Did you say the
London-Glasgow express?
Radhika,
there's a bomb threat on 112.
The bomb can explode
if its speed goes below 60.
Perhaps someone is playing a prank.
But I'm not taking any chances.
What?
Okay, listen up, everyone. Guys.
Guys. Guys. Come on, listen up.
There's a bomb threat on
London-Glasgow Express, No. 112.
I want each and every
one of you to concentrate.
Radhika, keep the track
of 112 clear. - Yes.
John, get me the
driver on the line.
Sir. You're needed inside,
urgently.
I told you there's
a bomb on the train.
If you think it's a hoax then...
You...
Give me the phone.
Hello. Hello.
Just rewind. Quickly.
Stop. Play.
'It's a hoax then... '
'You... '
Hello. He's on line.
Who are you?
I just heard you abuse.
What do you want?
Who are you?
My name is Sanjay Raina.
Railway Traffic Controller.
My name isn't more important
than 500 passengers' lives.
But your good sense
could save their lives.
Hence, listen carefully.
If you this is a hoax then
I have planted a similar bomb...
...on London Manchester
Goods Train 509.
It is currently running
at the speed of 15m/hr.
In a while the train will ascend.
While ascending its speed
will reduce by 5 miles.
And the bomb will explode.
If you want to save the drivers...
...then they should jump
off it before the bomb explodes.
Hello.
A bomb. Come on, jump.
All the exchange points
that I am concerned about...
Sir, he hasn't lied.
Goods train just blew off.
There was a bomb on that train.
What about the drivers?
Sir, they jumped off
before the bomb exploded.
But there were minor injuries.
Find out the exact position
and speed of the train.
Right, sir.
- Fast.
And John, I want the position
of all the trains coming
in the opposite direction.
Bring it over.
- Yes, sir.
Sir, it has just crossed
Chelsea on the North Line.
And the speed is 90m/hr.
Good. Ask the driver
to maintain the speed...
...and not to reduce it at
any cost, unless I say so. - Sir.
John, inform all stations, 112
will not be making scheduled stops.
Okay, sir.
Radhika, check all lines,
crossings and signals.
There shouldn't be any
obstructions on the track.
Right, sir.
Hi, sir. It's Richard speaking.
Sir, I've got the
train driver on the line.
What's his name, John?
Give me the headphones.
- Richard. - Richard.
Richard.
- Sir.
We have reason to believe
there is a bomb on your train.
We have no official
confirmation yet.
But we are not taking
any chances, Richard.
Richard. Richard.
Richard, get a hold of yourself
and listen to me very carefully.
What is your speed right now?
110 miles per hour, sir.
We should be reaching
our next station in 20 minutes.
We could stop and do checks there.
No. No. No. No. No, Richard.
You'll do nothing of that sort.
If you reduce your speed to less
than 60m/hr the bomb will go off.
Do you hear me?
Radhika, how long will it take
to reach Glasgow at this speed?
Sir, approximately 10 hours.
Okay, Richard, now concentrate.
You bring your
speed down to 70m/hr.
That will make your journey
to Glasgow to about 12 hours.
Wish you luck.
- Sanjay.
Sanjay.
This is Sanjay Raina.
Our head traffic controller.
Detective inspector Allen fisher.
Senior investigative officer.
Good morning.
Has the bomber called again?
- No, not yet.
Well, he might.
So, we need to be prepared.
Where's the control room?
- It's this way, sir.
Sir, sir. Excuse me, sir.
Can I have a quiet word?
Sir, we've an emergency situation.
And this is an emergency
joining call for you.
When we go to Jammu
we'll do a lot of shopping.
You two will have
to go to India alone.
Why, is everything fine?
There's an emergency, Alka.
The department has called
me to the office for an urgent job.
I am sorry, Alka.
I think I will have
to work for another day.
Mamma was right.
You can never retire.
Why aren't we stopping?
Are we supposed
to be stopping here?
How can this be?
My ticket is valid to this station.
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Where's the train manager?
Excuse me.
Could you tell us what's going on?
Yeah. Why haven't we stopped?
Please, be calm.
There is nothing to worry about.
You sure passed our
station without stopping.
How can you tell me not to worry?
Sir, please. Sit down.
- No. No. No.
Shut up and tell
us what's going on.
Calm down.
Excuse me.
Why didn't he tell
us why didn't he stop?
What's going on?
This is Chief Inspector
Shivan Menon, narcotics branch.
Please open the door.
Is there any problem?
Yes, sir.
The metropolitan police
have confirmed a bomb blast...
...that occurred this
morning on a Northern Railway.
That a Manchester bound
goods train exploded...
...this morning near York.
I am currently standing outside
Platform 10 at Euston station.
That a similar bomb
has been placed on...
...the London-Glasgow train
112 that left this morning
Police suspect this is
where the bomb was planted.
Sir, is there some sort of crisis?
Many trains have been stopped.
Sir, there was a blast on 509...
- No comments.
Are all the tracks
ahead of it clear?
Sir, they are clear
for the next three stations.
A lot of trains are getting delayed
because of these diversions.
There cannot be any issue
greater than this, at the moment.
See, I don't care.
- Sir...
Even if I've to cancel every single
train in the whole of England.
Yeah.
If you do what I say...
- Sir, but... Sir.
Just do what I say.
- Arjun Khanna.
Counter Terrorism Command.
Sanjay Raina.
Railway Traffic Controller.
I heard that you spoke
to the bomber. - Yes.
You handled the situation well,
Mr. Raina.
In spite of you talking
to him he didn't blast the train.
Otherwise police's job
would have gotten easier.
Sir.
Excuse me.
Mr. Raina, how long will
it take the train to reach Glasgow?
About 101/2 hours.
Yes, Miranda?
These are the trains that were
diverted to the south-east line.
And which is this one?
It's alright. Just give it to me.
Who could it be?
Not a terrorist.
If he would've been one,
he couldn't have called to inform.
He would've called after the
incident to claim responsibility.
If he is not a terrorist
then what does he want?
Get me that.
You spoke to the bomber, Mr. Raina.
It's your job to give
me the details. - Fine.
Was he an Indian or a Pakistani?
I think an Indian.
- Why do you think so?
Because he was talking
in Hindi and not Urdu.
Which accent was he talking in?
Gujarati, Bengali, Punjabi?
Look,
-Sir.
Sir, we have a huge problem here.
Train 308 is on our track
coming from the opposite direction.
Oh, God.
We diverted all the other trains,
except this one.
How far is 308 from the other one?
10 minutes.
- Change the track.
We can't do that, sir.
- Why?
Because there are only
two tracks in that area.
And there is already a stopped
goods train on that track.
There should be an exchange
line before the station.
Ken, get me your aerial
feed on the large monitor.
Okay. This is our train.
And on the same track
308 is coming towards us.
And on this track there
is just one exchange line.
Sir, this is the maintenance line.
You cannot change the track
with the speed of more than 50m/hr.
The train will topple.
- Even I know that.
Railways, as a safety precaution,
sets the limits 15-20 miles lower.
We'll have to take this
turn at the speed of more than 60.
We have to take that chance.
- But sir...
We have to take that chance,
Radhika.
How long it will take for our
train to reach the exchange point?
Three minutes.
And 308?
- Sir, five minutes.
Sir... - If both the trains
have to cross safely then...
...both have to reach their
exchange point at the same time.
Radhika, tell the driver of
308 to come towards us at 97m/hr.
Are you sure, sir?
- Just do it, Radhika.
John, give me the headphones.
Richard, hear me carefully.
There's an inbound
train coming your way.
You have to reduce
your speed to 65m/hr.
Do it now, Richard.
But 65m/hr is too close
to the trigger point.
Damn it, Richard. You have
to take that risk or it's over.
Do it now.
Kevin, you be on your toes.
You make the change when
they give you the signal.
You hear me, Kevin?
Three. Two. One.
Now.
Now.
It's time not for celebrate.
This is just the beginning, guys.
Please get back to work.
Thanks. Thank you.
Yes, Vikas?
Sir, I've checked the database of...
...all Indian and Pakistani
history-sheeters.
All of them are under the
watchful eyes of our officers.
I don't think he
is one of them. - Okay.
That means he's a new scoundrel.
Okay, do one thing.
Reach Railway's goods station.
I'll meet you there.
""Without you...""
""Without you I feel restless.""
""I feel restless.""
""Without you...""
""Without you I feel restless.""
""I feel restless.""
""You are my life.""
""You are my happiness.""
""You are my prayer.""
He's get a British citizenship
if he marries you.
And also be the
proprietor of my wealth.
And yet, you want to
make him my son-in-law.
Whether or not you
make him your son-in-law...
...I surely want
him to be my husband.
Oh, shut up.
What is his stature, after all?
Father, show some respect.
He's better educated than you are.
He's an engineer.
Nikita, if you want to
spend your life with them...
...then you'll have
to leave this house.
Aakash, come on.
""I swear.""
""I swear, beloved.""
""I am...""
""I am crazy about you.""
""How do I live?""
""How do I live, tell me.""
""I can't die either.""
""I swear.""
""I swear, beloved.""
""I am...""
""I am crazy about you.""
""How do I live?""
""How do I live, tell me.""
""I can't die either.""
""You are my life.""
""You are my prayer.""
""Without you...""
""Without you I feel restless.""
""I feel restless.""
""How do I say it?""
""Where do I go?""
""Who do I worship?""
""Who do I worship?""
Excuse me. Manish Solanki.
He's in Ward A, bed four.
Okay. One moment.
The payment has to be
made before the operation.
Sir, I have checked
the entire CCTV footage.
I couldn't see anyone.
Okay, when did
the goods train come?
Here, sir. On this track.
This area, sir.
Forceps.
Vikas.
I want the footage of the
past 24 hours from this camera.
Is this your bike?
Yes, it is.
- How many bikes do you have?
Five in total.
And all five of them
were with you last night?
No, three of them were with me.
Two of them are in the
garage getting repaired.
Where's the garage?
The Alfa point center.
Over on Richard Street.
Thank you.
Railway Control Security.
May I help you?
I want Sanjay.
Sanjay here.
Stay close to the phone or this
train won't stay close to the ground.
Okay.
What do you want?
10 million euros.
Old currency.
Why this silence?
You aren't paying from your pocket.
10 million isn't
much for 500 lives.
Listen...
You have one hour.
Exactly.
Yes, Vikas?
Sir, the bomber has
asked for 10 million euros.
Then the bomb will surely blow.
The ministry won't
pay up so easily.
What's the ministry's take on it?
They haven't taken
any decision as yet, sir.
Will they take a decision
after the bomb explodes?
Anyway, keep me posted.
The smoke meter's diaphragm...
Greetings.
Welcome.
What happened? Your car stalled?
Police.
Look, sir, I will tell you.
I am sure Mrs. Khanna
must have lodged a complaint.
Mrs. Khanna on purpose
wears skimpy clothes...
...and passes by my window.
I get compelled to whistle. I...
How many people work in here?
Here? Only six.
Everyone has a permit.
Everyone?
- Two don't.
It will come. I am trying.
Where are they?
- Here.
Novice. Come here.
Come here. Come here.
Hurry up.
Say hello to sir.
Hello.
Where's the other one?
The dark egg?
Sir, he didn't come today.
- He didn't?
I look at their innocent faces
and give them work and get trapped.
Where were you last night?
- I was with Mrs. Patil.
My wife, sir.
Where were you?
I was here, at work, sir.
- Alone?
Tell him.
- No, sir. Aadil was with me.
Who is Aadil?
The one I told you about.
The boy working without a permit.
The other mechanic.
He was with you the entire night?
Yes. No.
He had left to test the bike.
What time?
At 10 or 11pm.
Which bike?
Chip Shop's owner's bike.
Fish and chips' bike?
- Yes. Yes, sir.
Do you know Aadil? His whereabouts?
Where does he stay?
Do you have his address?
Sir, he didn't have a permit.
I just appointed him.
So, now we don't have documents.
One day you too will go
to jail along with such boys.
Vikas. Immediately send
a sketch artist to Alfa Garage.
We need a sketch
of a boy named Aadil.
Yeah!
- I guess we have got our guy.
What? There's a bomb?
What? A bomb on the train?
- There's a bomb on the train.
Listen, everybody.
There's a bomb on the train.
Oh, my God.
- Are you sure?
You lie to us.
Everybody, there's a bomb
on the train. - What?
How do you know it.
- It's all over the news.
There's a bomb.
Get inside.
Why don't you tell us.
Why don't you tell
us that we're in dangerous.
Shut the door.
- And get inside.
Leave him alone.
- There's a bomb on the train.
Don't push it.
Go back to your seats and sit down.
Everybody.
Stop it.
- You...
I'll blow your head
off if you touch anybody.
Okay? Go back to your seat.
Go.
Yes, there's a bomb on this train.
We can't stop or even
reduce the speed below 60m/hr.
Or the bomb will explode.
We can either panic right
now and make things hard...
...or we can stay calm and...
...trust the government
to get us out of this mess.
The position of the
British government...
...on terrorist acts is very clear.
There will be no
negotiation whatsoever.
Let's make it official.
All in favor raise your hands.
Mr. Khanna doesn't seem
to agree with our opinion.
May I ask you exactly
what do you have in mind?
I think we should
have the money ready.
Sir, all I am asking you
to is make the money visible.
It will be a tool
for me to negotiate.
A way to get the
boomer out in the open.
It will be just a bait.
And if you lose the
criminal and the money?
Sir...
You've believed in me for 23 years.
And I never failed to deliver.
You called me back from retirement
all because of your trust.
Just trust me one last time.
And I promise you...
I'll not lose the money
or the passengers on the train.
I'll get him.
Sir, Aadil's sketch has matched.
This is his file from
the immigration department.
Aadil Khan.
He came here from India, 7
years ago, on a tourist visa, sir.
With a music troupe.
He neither went back
nor did he ever get caught.
Dispatch his photo and all his
details to all the police stations.
Bus stations.
Police stations. Airports.
Everywhere.
Keep the police officers ready.
Yes, sir.
What's the news on the train?
The conductors have checked
all the compartments.
They didn't find any bomb, sir.
This means the bomb isn't
controlled by a lunatic.
This bomb is now
controlled by speed.
Listen, Vikas.
From Railway Control Centre take
the details of the next bridge.
I need 4- 5 high speed
cameras under that bridge.
I ant clear pictures
of every compartment's base.
Dear, I'm a little busy.
Can I... - Daddy...
Am I going to die?
What are you saying, Pia?
Everyone here is saying
that there is a bomb in the train.
Everyone is going to die.
No.
I am concentrating
only on your train.
I won't let anything happen to you.
Promise?
I promise.
Excuse me, Dr. Renu.
- Yes?
Please report to the front desk.
There's a telephone call for you.
Okay.
Hello. - Hello, Renu?
Renu, don't hang up.
Is Pia alright?
Renu...
- Coffee.
Pia is on a train.
And we've just got the news
that there is a bomb in that train.
Then stop the train
and get Pia out.
We cannot do that.
Until I don't inform you
anything about the train...
...don't believe in
what anyone else says.
I'll keep in touch.
Okay?
That way, sir.
Stop.
Now rewind.
Stop.
Zoom.
Bomb squad reports?
- That way, sir.
They say that the goods
train too had a similar bomb.
You see, sir,
there is an electronic dynamo.
It's sensor is attached
to the wheel of the train.
If the speed of the
train goes below 60...
...the dynamo will activate the
trigger and the bomb will explode.
It's all mentioned here, sir.
Under which compartments
is the bomb placed?
Four and seven.
Connect me to the
engineering department.
Send all the passengers
in the first three compartments.
Separate the rest of
the compartments from them.
I think that should work.
I don't think that's possible.
What you are saying is impossible.
Why is it not possible?
If we switch off the main
hydraulics of the train then...
You don't understand.
This train runs on
an automatic system.
If you switch off the hydraulics,
the train will stop right there.
And that bomb will explode.
You mean to say there
is no way to stop the train?
There is no way you can stop
that train... - If there was any...
I would've stopped it.
My daughter is on that train.
My daughter is on that train.
Hello.
Sanjay.
Sanjay, my money?
- It's ready.
Do you have any idea
of how many innocent lives...
...you are putting in danger?
If you get caught you'll die.
Why are you playing with your life?
One shouldn't love life too much.
In the end,
everyone has to lose it.
Look, I can help you
if you have been wronged.
You won't be able to catch
me even if you talk for long.
Give me my money, otherwise...
- Where to the money delivered?
Who are you?
Arjun Khanna.
Counter Terrorist Command.
I'll get your money.
Where should I get it?
Mr. Khanna, put the money in a bag.
There should be no
tracking device in it.
Nor should there
be any officer with you.
You should come alone.
Till I don't get the money no one will
know the way to defuse the bomb.
Gleynamand collage. Sorry.
In 20 minutes.
Are you Mr. Arjun Khanna?
Yes, Father.
Then I guess this belongs to you.
A gentleman delivered
it to us this morning.
He said you'll be
coming to collect it.
Did you happen to see his face?
- Sorry, I didn't.
He was wearing some kind of helmet.
But he did seem to
be in a great hurry.
Hello.
Mr. Khanna?
- Speaking.
Get into a car.
Get out through the
forth gate and take a left.
Go straight and take another left.
It will take you to an
unpaved road. Keep driving.
It was that scoundrel's call.
Vikas, I'm calling you.
You'll get this mobile's number.
As soon as the
bomber calls again...
...trace his exact
location and tell me.
I'm taking this car.
Did you see ""the inn"" board?
Yes.
Turn right from there.
Half a kilometer away you will
see an ""animal crossing"" board.
Take a left from there.
Okay.
Sir. Sir.
Yes, Vikas. Tell me.
Sir, the call got traced.
What's the exact location?
Alexandra, Bun No. 67 Hogway.
Okay. Go for him and get him alive.
I'll keep him busy.
- Okay, sir.
Come on, guys.
Let's get inside. Let's move.
Animal crossing road.
Got it. I got it.
Turn right.
Hello.
I can't see any Richards
Farm's board here.
Mr. Khanna, I guess
you aren't paying attention.
I think I'll have to hang up.
Yes, I can see it. I can see it.
This is the police.
You've been surrounded.
Slowly come out with
your hands over your head.
There is no other way out for you.
Freeze.
Don't take a wrong
turn at any cost today.
It can prove to be dangerous.
Stop the car near
the Rapid's board.
He watches a lot of English movies.
I'll have to give him that.
Will you tell us what to do next.
Get out of the car.
By now you must have
reached a riverbank.
Yes.
There, below a tree, there's
a yellow waterproof suitcase.
Got it?
Keep the money in it.
Now throw the
suitcase in the water.
I said, throw the suitcase
in the water and walk away.
I want all units to setup a two
kilometer radius around this area.
All highway routes
should be blocked.
No vehicle should be allowed
to pass without being checked.
Please stop otherwise
we will have to open fire.
This is your last warning.
Please stop otherwise
we will have to open fire.
This is your very last warning.
...is escaping.
Move. Move.
Every time I think you
cannot do anything more stupid...
...you prove me wrong.
What do you think of yourself.
Who told you to give in?
How are we going
to stop the train now?
Hey, look, if you can't handle it,
you should've left it to us.
You are an amateur.
It was an accident.
You coming back was the accident.
We needed him alive.
The bomber is still alive.
She was not the bomber.
She?
Don't look confused.
There's more than one
person involved in this crime.
So, how do you intend to proceed?
That's for me to know
and you to find out.
As you know, Alan, that
investigations are based on leads.
And I have one.
Vikas.
- Sir.
I got this hospital bill
from that girl's pocket.
Get all the details possible.
And do this fast.
We are running out of time.
Miss, please come with us.
- I can't.
She's getting off.
Come on, get her.
No. Please let me go.
Let me go, please.
Please. I have not done anything.
What's happening?
What's happening out here?
Please, don't hand
me over to the police.
They will send me back to India.
Please.
It's my...
It's a question of my life.
Along with mine, my family's
life will also get ruined.
Please. Let me go. Please.
I haven't done anything wrong.
I'm scared for my life.
Please, sir.
Hello?
Did everything go well, sir?
Hello?
Where are you?
Where is Megha?
Megha is dead.
No. Oh, God.
Aadil.
- No!
Aadil!
Moments ago,
a high speed chase on the M25...
...has resulted in the death
of the London railway bomber.
Authorities have said that the
bomber, a female in her twenties...
...was trying to escape
on her dirt-bike...
...and had a fatal accident
during the chase with the police.
Hello?
- Hello, Sanjay?
Sanjay, tell me the truth.
Everyone here is telling
me a different story.
I had told you, no matter what
anyone tells you about this train...
...don't believe in it.
But in the news they are
showing that the bomber is dead.
That train won't stop.
Media...
Media has gone crazy.
The bomber is a guy.
He is still alive.
And I am talking to him.
I hope you are not saying
so just to calm me down.
Do one thing.
Talk to her. You'll feel better.
Hello?
Hello.
Hello, Pia?
Mamma?
Are you alright, dear?
Yes. But how did you get my number?
Your father gave it to me.
You spoke to him?
Yes, dear.
The bomber is dead.
It's all over.
We are all going to die.
I'm not die like this.
I bet we can jump off this train.
- Please sit down.
How are you going to defuse the
bomb if the bomber is already dead?
The bomber is not dead.
How do you know?
My daddy is a chief
of railway control centre.
What's your name?
- Pia.
Pia Raina.
Okay, Pia,
what did your father say?
He told my mother that
the bomber is not dead.
Can I talk to your father?
I found sister-in-law's address.
She's a teacher in
some kindergarten school.
I didn't get any other information.
Megha's brother's operation
was to take place today.
Of what?
He has started lose vision.
Both his eyes.
The operation is very expensive.
And if he doesn't get it done,
he can go blind.
I think they have found
out that we are Indians.
Unit four, are you in position?
In position, sir. Shall I go in?
- No.
Hold your positions.
Nobody approaches the
target without my orders.
Aadil, run.
Hey.
Hey, stop.
- Stop. - No.
Hey.
Stop.
Come
Whoa, whoa.
Get him. Get him.
Just kill him.
Whoa
Move!
No. Get him.
Watch it, man.
Get him.
Stop, or I shoot.
Get down, everybody get down.
I've got him.
Clear the bridge. Clear the bridge.
Stop. I said stop.
Damn it.
Drive.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Here. Have some sweets.
Sweets? What are we celebrating?
Remember, I had told
you about my brother, Manish?
He has got an admission
in an engineering college here.
Oh, that's nice.
But how did he come to UK?
He didn't come through
illegitimate means like us, sir.
He has come legally.
He has got student visa.
Then you deserve
double congratulations.
He'll be an engineer like me.
This has been possible
only because of you.
You had done a lot of favors.
My parents...
- Enough. Enough. Enough.
Give me the sweets.
This is a routine check.
Stay where they are.
This is the UK Border Agency.
Everybody stay where they are.
Wait a minute. Sir, please.
Sir, people from the immigration
department are outside.
They are checking
everyone's papers.
What should we do?
Aadil. You leave with Megha.
Sir, but you?
I'll take care of them.
You both leave.
But, sir, you too.
- Just stop it.
I said go.
Come on, Megha, let's go.
- Go.
Hi, Officer.
Is there a problem here?
My name is Peter Harvey from
the Department of Immigration.
And a few of them
don't seem to have...
...the proper documentation
to work in the UK.
I guess I am not aware of that.
What's your job here, sir?
I am the CEO.
- And who owns the company?
My wife.
- Can I see your papers, please?
I have applied for my
citizenship and work permit.
I have a copy of that.
- Sir, without citizenship...
...and work permit you
cannot work in this country.
I'm afraid you
have to come with us.
It's okay.
It's okay. It's almost done.
Just relax.
May I know who he is?
Someone who has nothing to lose.
And you?
Someone who has lost everything.
Let's go.
Thanks, Doctor.
I think we should stop right here.
Why?
Our intention was to commit
a crime and get our lives back.
Without endangering anyone's life.
Megha has lost her life.
And you are injured.
I don't want the money
at the expense of your life.
It's no use backing out now, sir.
Megha is dead.
And if I didn't have the
hope that you would return...
...then I would've
hanged myself long back.
Who do we fear?
If we don't win,
what do we have to lose?
And if we win,
we have our lives ahead of us.
Give it here.
Yeah, Sanjay here.
Everyone in this world
wants to go to heaven.
But no one wants
to die to go to heaven.
Your mistake will today
take those passengers to heaven.
The deal is off.
Have you gone mad?
Who the hell do you think you are?
When the government
had given you the money...
...to give to the bomber
then why did you have to act smart?
You should have quietly given
the money and defused the bomb.
That money was a means
to catch those scoundrels.
Not to fulfill their demands.
Now just calm down.
Now don't you tell me to calm down.
I've been trying my best
to save the train since morning...
...so that you get time
for your investigation.
A lot of time has been wasted,
but the little hope that we had...
...you have ruined that as well.
Mr. Sanjay, I understand.
- No, you don't understand.
Because you don't have anyone
close to you on that train.
Shut up. Everyone in that
train has a near and dear one.
I don't need a reason
to save people's lives.
It's my job. It's my duty.
He will call back.
Why will he call back?
How do you know so?
I'm telling you, he will call.
- Why will he call?
Because he won't leave
without taking his money.
He will not call. - It's him.
- He will call.
It's him.
Hello. - Take the money and
go St. Georges hall.
And don't do anything stupid thi
Last chance.
Excuse me, mister. This is for you.
Who gave you this? Hey, listen.
Put the bag in the
trash can behind you.
Keep an eye on the green dustbin.
I repeat...
Green dustbin.
Alpha Team, talk to me.
No, sir. Nothing yet.
Snipers.
Keep an eye on the green dustbin.
No fatal shots.
I want this guy alive. - Okay.
Here's your coffee, sir.
Okay. Thank you.
Sir, I've just seen
something in his hand.
Bravo Team, do you see anything?
No sir, still looking. Nothing yet.
He will come. We will see him soon.
Target confirmed.
Approaching drop point.
Everyone, now, stay calm.
Be focused. Be focused.
Negative, sir.
Can I have a word with you, please?
They've found a suspect.
That's his picture.
'Do you have the packages?'
'What's the idea?
- You'll know soon.'
Stay back.
Move. Move. Move.
Hey. Where's the emergency brake?
- I don't know, man. Calm down.
Go ahead.
You'll show me the emergency brake.
Stay back.
Move. Move. Move. Stay down.
The emergency brakes have to be
put on anyhow before any station.
Where is the breaks.
There.
Why aren't they working?
The driver has jammed the brakes.
Open up or I'll
blow the door. - Stop.
If you got to shoot someone,
shoot me.
We got to get off this train.
We got to get off this train.
We got to get off this train.
We are going to die. - Shut up.
We are going to die.
- Shut up.
It's true. It's true.
- What's true?
I sold the explosives to him, okay?
I saw him at the railway station.
Saw whom?
The bomber.
You know him?
- Yes.
Who's he?
His name is Aadil Khan.
- Where does he stay?
Hello?
Job's done.
Yes. Yes.
Yes.
How are you feeling?
Now I'm feeling great, sir.
Okay, I'm coming.
I will be back in five minute.
Okay.
Come on!
Come on.
Keep moving back. Back.
- Keep moving back. - Back.
Please. Come on.
Please back.
Move back.
Move back.
Hello. - Aadil, try leaving
through the back door.
No, sir.
Police has surrounded the place.
Then I'll come upstairs.
Don't try to save me,
you too will die.
Then we will die together.
- Come on, move back.
Please leave, sir.
Just go.
Get back.
Get back.
Team A, cover. Cover.
Drop your weapons.
You're surrounding.
Come out with your hands up.
Come on immediately.
Drop your weapons. You're arrested.
Come out with your hands up.
Immediately.
If you move, you'll die.
Me or we?
The investigation strategy
was to get the bomber alive...
...defuse the bomb
and save the passengers.
And what are you doing?
Killing them one by one.
Who the hell do you think you are?
Dirty Harry?
He blew himself up.
It was a suicide.
Oh, so, now,
what do you suggest we do?
Catch the real bomber.
The man who has the money.
- Yeah.
The idea of the money
was to use it as bait.
Hey, he's lost all the money.
He's killing all the bombers.
He screwed up the whole operation.
For all we know, he could
be a part of the conspiracy.
And gets his share of money
when he gets back to India.
What did you say?
Another word and I'll
break your jaw. - Sir.
I'll break your jaw.
- Sir. Sir. No, sir.
Vikas, let go of me.
Let me teach him a lesson.
- Sir, please. Please. Stop.
What does he think of himself?
- Yes.
Get him off me.
- You foreigner!
Let it be, Vikas, I will show him.
- No, sir.
Get him off me.
- Sir, let it be.
Leave me.
- Sir. Let it be, sir.
Listen to what he is saying.
- Let it be, sir. Please.
We are getting defamed
because of such scoundrels.
One man plants a bomb
and because of that...
...his community and
his country gets slandered.
Today it's either me or the bomber.
Sanjay here.
There's a restaurant
at Alford Lane. Delhi Darbar.
There's a table
booked in your name.
You'll find an
envelope on the table.
It contains the instructions
on how to defuse the bomb.
""I am dew.""
""You are my dawn.""
""I am love.""
""You are my world.""
""I am the speaker.""
""You are my prayer.""
""I am the ground.""
""You are my sky.""
""We met,
in spite of being worlds apart.""
That's my husband. He's my husband.
""Nothing came between us.""
- He's my husband.
""Let me spend my life with you,
beloved.""
""Let me spend my life with you,
beloved.""
Aakash.
- ""In your arms...""
""In your path...""
""In your arms...""
""In your path...""
""Let me spend my life.""
""Let me spend my life with you,
beloved.""
I tried hard to look for you.
Phone calls, letters, emails.
But I didn't get any reply.
Then I thought of
asking your father.
All I got was abuses.
I was in prison for six months.
The loan we took was in my name.
After you left, I couldn't
repay the loan on my own.
First I went under trial
and then I was imprisoned.
Our child?
He's playing outside.
He?
Daddy.
How did he recognize me?
I've been telling your son about
you since the last four years.
And everyday, he looks at
this picture and waits for you.
What is your name?
- Aakash.
Go out and play, Aakash.
The name Aakash
holds some hope to it.
I wish you were here.
I wish we were together.
I couldn't find a name better
than Aakash to live with this hope.
Nikita, I'm here to take you.
Come back, man. Come back.
The letter that you had
kept for us in Delhi Darbar...
...got burnt with the restaurant.
We are making an appeal.
Call us for the last
time and tell us...
...how do we disarm this bomb.
This is an appeal.
Thank you. That's it.
How much time do we have?
Sir, two hours.
Okay. One second.
Ask the rescue team,
if we run another train...
...parallel to this one,
at the same speed...
...can they transfer the passengers
from one train to another?
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Come on you can do it.
Come on.
Move your hand. Come on.
You rigth there.
Come on. Come on.
Keep moving.
Keep moving.
Grab my hand.
Come on. Steady. Steady.
Be careful.
Come on!
Keep closing.
Come on, Come on.
Don't look down.
Don't look down.
Keet going.
I can't.
Please. Come on.
Go!
Keep closing.
Faster, faster.
Leave the belt.
You can do it.
Faster. Faste.
Give me your hand.
Turn off your belt, sir.
Give me your hand.
Turn off your belt, sir.
Give me your hand.
Come on. Just go in.
Down. Help it.
Mr. Manish.
Someone's come to see you.
Who is it?
I'm Megha's friend.
She has told me about you.
And I came here to...
You are here to pay
the fees for the operation?
Yes.
I'm here to pay the fees.
You are brother Aakash, right?
No, I'm Arjun.
Which Aakash are you talking about?
Aakash Rana.
My sister treated
him like a brother.
She had said that
he and brother Aadil...
...will come to meet
me before the operation.
Surprising. Aadil never
told me anything about Aakash.
Four years ago, he was their boss.
Then, all of a sudden,
he had to shut down the company...
...and go to a foreign country.
I heard that he came
back a few days back.
Yes, Megha was saying
something about it.
I don't remember
the company's name.
What was the name of the company?
Global services.
Global services.
Okay.
Sister said she'll be
back before the operation.
Hello, Vikas.
Do a background
check on Aakash Rana.
We deported him to
India 4-5 years ago.
He used to work here in
a company called Global Services.
I want details of his family,
his friends.
I want details of his every move.
Excuse me.
Please charge for Manish Solanki.
I think it's Ward E, bed four.
Sorry, what name?
- Manish Solanki.
Oh, everything has
already been paid for, sir.
By whom?
- Oh, he was just here.
He left the ward.
Just time a corridor.
Vikas, that scoundrel is here.
He just paid the hospital bill.
I am getting all doors
and exits of the hospital closed.
You quickly send backup.
Please call security.
This is Detective Arjun Khanna.
Counter Terrorism Command.
The train bomber has
been spotted in your hospital.
Yes. The train bomber has
been spotted in your hospital.
I want you to lock all your doors,
exits, anything to get of here.
Nobody moves out of the
hospital till the police comes.
Come with me, I want to
see his face. - Sorry?
I mean I want you to identify him.
I want you to identify him.
Please come with me.
Okay.
Please calm down.
All of you please calm down.
There he is.
He's gone that way.
Police.
Come out.
No.
Open the boot.
Sorry.
CTC.
- Sir.
This is Anne.
She has seen the suspect
and she'll be able to identify him.
I want every person, every car,
every boot to be checked, now.
Yes, sir.
- Yes.
Yes, Vikas?
Sir, there are some
Air India tickets booked...
...under Aakash Rana's name.
The flight leaves at eight.
Some Nikita Rana and
a child are with him.
Where are you at the moment?
I'm going to the headquarters, sir.
Go to the airport, right away.
And go directly to
the check-in counter.
And see to it that no one boards
the flight using those tickets.
Are you listening? I'm on my way.
So, we went up to look
at the security cameras.
Then we came down here...
Sir.
So far no man named Aakash Rana...
...has showed up
at the check-in counter.
Now the counter has closed, sir.
And there is no booking
on this name on any other flight.
Thoroughly crosscheck any
Indian or Asian you come across.
Sir.
Did you get any
photo or ID of Aakash?
That will take a little time, sir.
Immigration department will send
us a photo as soon as they find it.
If he isn't taking flight then...
...there is only one way
to get out of this country.
When does the train to Paris leave?
Sir, I think, the last train
leaves in an hour and a half.
He has made a fool out of us.
Come on, let's go.
'The letter that you had
kept for us in Delhi Darbar... '
'... got burnt
with the restaurant.'
'We are making an appeal.'
'Call us for the last time and tell
us, how do we disarm this bomb.'
'This is an appeal.
Thank you. That's it.'
Sir, the ministry has sent orders.
We'll have to stop the
train at Glasgow station.
Sir, according to them,
they have got the station vacated.
And a 90 Members Rescue team is
also provided there.
This is not possible.
They have lost their mind.
The train cannot enter
the station at this speed.
Anyway,
if the speed goes below 60...
...the bomb will explode
before it reaches the station.
No, sir.
They aren't reducing the speed.
They want the train
to crash against...
...the break-ribbons and
sandbags at the speed of 60.
Sir, the fire brigades
is already there.
They have also started
spraying the anti-fire chemicals.
Doctors, paramedics, police.
Everyone is on standby.
Even the passengers are being
shifted to the last compartment.
That will kill more
than half the people.
Sir, they say that at least
some people will get saved.
This is ridiculous.
This is stupidity.
Sir, it's him.
Yes. Sanjay.
There is no bomb on the train.
You can stop the train.
No, no. you are lying.
Bomb squad has confirmed it.
I saw the bombs under the train.
Yes, there are.
But they aren't activated.
I had written the same in the letter
I had send to the restaurant.
Listen, please, don't play
with the lives of innocent people.
I cannot say anything
more than that.
Just a minute. Just a minute.
The bomber just called.
He said that the bombs are
fake and that they won't go off.
He is a liar.
We can't take that chance.
We follow the ministry's orders
and stop the train at Glasgow only.
To hell with the orders.
I am stopping the train right now.
You cannot override the ministry.
You understand!
Oh yes, I can.
I'm in-charge here.
These are my people.
And they will do exactly
what I tell them to do.
But sir, why do you trust him?
Had he been a liar,
he wouldn't have called.
What?
He wouldn't have
called if it's a lie.
If this goes wrong...
...you are going down for life.
John...
...Stop the train.
Hello?
I will wait for you at the station.
I hope you come.
Yes, I'm coming.
Yes?
Are you... Nikita Rana?
Yes?
Nikita, take a good look.
The lives of 500 people
now rests in your hands.
Inform me as soon as you spot him.
Excuse me.
He's here.
Okay, good.
Move closer to him.
Go to him.
Authorities have confirmed
that the bomb on...
...the Glasgow bound
train 112 was a hoax.
The high tension ordeal
which lasted 14 hours today...
...has finally ended.
There were no reports
of causalities as passengers...
...started disembarking
the express train minutes earlier.
There was no bomb
connected to the train.
Everyone's safe.
All the passengers of 112 have
alighted from the train safely.
Don't look at my site.
Nikita?
Nikita?
Nikita, can you hear me? Nikita?
Where is he?
I'm asking you, where is he?
Please tell me where is he.
Sorry, that wasn't Aakash.
What do you mean he wasn't Aakash?
He wasn't Aakash but someone else.
I know you saw him.
I saw you looking at him.
Don't lie to me. Don't lie to me.
You are the one lying to me.
You told me he's a bomber.
Yes. Yes. He's a bomber.
And this is your only
chance to save the passengers.
Once again you are lying.
Everyone is safe.
All the news channels
are showing it.
Someone was playing a prank.
And you want to punish
my husband for it?
Just because if entered
this country illegally?
Just because he wants
to meet his wife and child?
Why are you not getting this?
He is a criminal
according to the law.
And you are helping a criminal.
Your law has given
a very harsh punishment.
He just wanted to help people.
Do you have any idea
how many lives and families...
...has your law ruined?
Let him go.
He wants to leave
this place for good.
I won't let that happen.
I will arrest him.
It's my duty.
You... you...
- I cannot help you in it.
You can find him on your own.
Please.
Please. Please try to help me.
No.
Daddy.
No. No. That's not him.
That's not Aakash.
That's not him.
That's not him. No.
The bomber is on level one.
Send back up immediately.
Can I go now?
You have go...
But to a prison.
Surrender yourself.
You don't have a choice.
I still have a choice.
Don't compel me.
You are a criminal.
You cannot escape your punishment.
You don't need to be a
criminal to endure a punishment.
It's the same even
if you are innocent.
What wrong had I done?
I tried to fulfill
a dream of a good life...
...through hard work and honesty.
It was called cheating. A fraud.
I helped the ones in need.
It was called sabotage. A murder.
When I married the one I loved,
it was called rape.
Yet I got punished.
Everyone was taken away from me.
My wife, my child,
my friends, my hopes, my future.
Everything.
You, too,
must be having a wife, a child.
Ask your heart...
...what would have you
done had you been in my place?
And still,
if you think that I am wrong...
...then take the gun.
And shoot me.
I am going, to my child.
I want to hug him and
sleep one night peacefully.
No.
'We had a lot of dreams
which stayed as dreams.'
'There was love,
thank God, it stayed intact.'
'If you are reading this
letter then it's certain...'
'... that I've gone

Two men find something wrapped in a pond. One man begins unwrapping the package while the other goes to get a drink for the two. As soon as the man opens the wrapped package, smoke comes out of the mirror inside it and suffocates the man, traumatizing his friend.

Two years later, Shirin Grover (Sonarika Bhadoria) is the mysterious singer at Azalle, one of the best clubs in Mauritius, owned by her roommate Tanya (Neetha Shetty). She always leaves the club before midnight and does not let anyone come near her. One night, Ronnie (Aman Prajapat) lusts for Shirin, and he and his friends chase after her while she leaves in a taxi. They stop her taxi, but strange occurrences disturb the group, and Ronnie’s friends along with the taxi driver run away. As soon as he touches Shirin, a mysterious force attacks Ronnie, and he is killed.

An Indian detective catches the case of Ronny’s murder and he immediately suspects Shirin. Tanya encourages a depressed Shirin to fight for the sake of her little sister Aditi. The detective interrogates Shirin and Tanya.

While praying at a template, Shirin catches the eye of a businessman named Abhay (Rajneesh Duggal). He goes to Azalle to watch her sing and continues to follow her around. She always performs and tries to go home before midnight. He picks up a scarf that she leaves at a shop.

That night, a mysterious force attacked Abhay using the scarf. Abhay approaches Tanya to help find out more about Shirin allusiveness. He goes to Tanya and Shirin’s house and watches Shirin get attacked by a mysterious force at midnight. He tells Shirin and Tanya that he is willing to fight for his love.

Abhay seeks the help of C.K. Bir (Hiten Tejwani), a medium. They discover that the spirit is from a previous life that is haunting Shirin. Her name was Simran, and she was about to marry her childhood friend Vivek. A man named Shubrat (Aamir Dalvi) came into their home during the pre-wedding celebrations. He became obsessed with Simran, who only had eyes for Vivek. Shubrat seduced Simran’s younger sister Reva and manipulated her into drugging and seducing Vivek. When Simran found out, she broke up with Vivek. Shubrat stepped in to marry Simran. On their wedding night, Simran overheard Shubrat and Reva fighting. She confronted Shubrat, and in a scuffle, Shubrat hit his head on a mirror and died exactly at midnight. Soon after, one by one, all of Simran’s family started to die.

C.K. Bir tells Shirin, Tanya, and Abhay that Shubrat’s spirit is trapped in the mirror that killed him. They think Aditi is going to be his next victim, with Abhay going to save her just in time.

They find a mystical talisman that they will need for the exorcism and go to the house where Simran lived with her family since the exorcism must happen in the same place Shubrat died. There, Abhay runs into the man guarding the mirror, believing his friend is trapped inside.

They bring the mirror to the room where Shubrat died. During the exorcism, the spirit possesses Tanya and attacks Simran. The exorcism is successful, but they are unable to save Tanya’s life.",3107,NA,NA,NA

Laila Kapoor is a teenager with cerebral palsy studying at Delhi University. She is an aspiring writer and also composes music for an indie band at the university. Laila develops feelings for the lead singer, but is heartbroken when she is rejected. Moving on from the experience, Laila is overjoyed to receive a scholarship for a semester's study at New York University. Despite her father's reservations, she moves to Greenwich Village, Manhattan with her orthodox Maharashtrian mother, Shubhangini Damle.

Laila meets an attractive young man named Jared, who is assigned to help her in the creative writing class. She also meets a young activist, Khanum, a blind girl of Pakistani-Bangladeshi descent, with whom she falls in love. Laila is enamoured by Khanum's fiercely independent personality and her positive perspective towards her own disability. The two spend most of their time together, filling in as each other's caregivers. Laila becomes confused about her sexual orientation, as she is attracted to men (Jared in particular) while being in a serious relationship with Khanum. She has sex with Jared, only to regret it immediately. Laila does not tell Khanum about this encounter. Oblivious to her daughter's relationship with Khanum, Laila's mother invites Khanum to Delhi to spend the summer vacation with Laila's family.

Laila ultimately finds the courage to come out to her mother about bisexuality and her relationship with Khanum, both of which her mother strongly disapproves. Laila also confesses to Khanum that she had sex with Jared and asks for her forgiveness. Feeling betrayed by Laila, Khanum breaks up with her and leaves for New York. Shubhangini is diagnosed with advanced colon cancer which has relapsed after previous treatments. Laila and her mother move past their differences while Laila tends to her at the hospital. The two eventually reconcile shortly before Shubhangini's death. Laila plays a song (recorded by Shubhangini) at Shubhangini's funeral telling how much she loved her and how she was the only one who ever understood her.

"37","tt2609218","Ragini MMS 2",2014,"Plot

The film begins where the previous film ended. Ragini, since the incident in the first film, has been at Thane Mental Asylum, and even there she has been haunted by the ghost of the previous film. Meanwhile, Ragini's MMS tape has gone viral - along with rumours of the house's haunted nature, where the MMS was filmed. This catches the attention of a sleazy director, Rocks (Parvin Dabas) who decides to make a movie about the haunting. He signs an ex-porn star, Sunny Leone (Sunny Leone) as the lead actress and decides to shoot the movie in the same house where the MMS was recorded.

Sunny, who takes an instant liking to the script, seeks permission to meet the real Ragini (Kainaz Motivala), to get a better in-depth understanding of the character she wants to portray. But the meeting goes horribly wrong when Ragini stabs herself brutally in the neck.

Later, the cast and crew arrive at the haunted house to shoot and strange things begin to happen, especially to Sunny. Elsewhere, Dr. Meera Dutta (Divya Dutta), a psychiatrist who specialises in cases for which science has no answers, takes up Ragini's case. After going through old newspaper clippings and video tapes of Ragini, she finds the truth regarding the haunting.

She finds out that the ghost haunting the house was a married woman with two daughters and a son. She loved her son more than her daughters since she had conceived him after much difficulty and prayer. One day, the boy and his two sisters were playing hide and seek when the boy slipped into a well and drowned. This drove his mother insane and caused her to embark on a desperate quest to resurrect him from the dead. A Baba who claimed to perform black magic arrived and convinced her the only way to bring her son back was to sacrifice both of her daughters. The insane mother agreed and the Baba chopped off the daughters' heads. He put the sword in her hands, told her to close her eyes, and chant. While she did that he stole all of her money and ran away. When the villagers finally arrived, they assumed that the mother was practising witchcraft and punished her by hanging her from a tree, stoning her, and burning her alive. The woman survived, finally dropped from the tree, and after cursing them all, killed herself by stabbing herself in the neck with the rattle-toy her son used to play with.

Dr. Dutta then rushes to the shooting location to inform the cast and crew to abandon their shooting and leave the house immediately. But it is too late as the ghost has already possessed Sunny and started killing the film's cast and crew by either luring them into having sex or by catching them off guard. Only the scriptwriter Satya (Saahil Prem) and actress Monali (Sandhya Mridul) are left alive.

As Dr. Dutta, Monali and Satya attempt to drive the ghost out of Sunny, Monali gets killed. Afterwards, when Satya accidentally steps on the rattle toy with which the woman committed suicide prior to becoming a ghost, it causes Sunny temporary pain, and thereby forces the ghost to temporarily leave Sunny. Dr. Dutta realises the toy's importance and urges Satya to destroy it. Eventually the ghost is destroyed along with the rattle. Sunny, Satya and Dr. Dutta leave the house, having exorcised the ghost and solving the mystery behind the haunting. At the end of the movie a rocking chair is shown rocking back and forth and a child's voice is heard, implying that there is still a ghost in the house.",3456,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt2609218.srt","Listen it's 9.30 pm,
Let's put off all the lights.
Okay.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Rocks.
Why did you choose such
a controversial subject..
..for your first movie?
Look.. madam.
You only see sex..
..controversy and
scandal in Ragini MMS.
I..
I..see a story.
A boy takes a girl
to a lonely bungalow..
..for a dirty weekend.
Out there he shoots an MMS video.
The MMS goes viral.
The boy..went missing.
The girl says that there
was a witch in that house..
..who killed the boy.
But we cannot entirely
trust the girl.
Because it's said that..
..the girl went insane
after the incident.
Since the last 3 years..
..she's been in a mental asylum.
Now that is a story.
I will shoot my film..
..where Ragini's MMS was shot.
Horr-ex film.
A combo of horror and sex.
And after watching the
film the audience won't know..
..whether to be terrified or excited.
Rocks, one more question.
- Go ahead.
You've worked with all
the top actors in the industry.
But you've hired
TV stars for your film.
Is it because after
your last movie flopped..
..no big actor wants
to work with you?
This was a conscious
decision, okay.
My story.
My story is real.
This incident is real. Stars.
Stars will make it look fake.
And as for the female lead,
that is a surprise.
She's an actress that makes..
..all the other stars
run for their money.
She is going to put the..
back into Ragini.

I present you..Ragini.

Close your eyes. - Why?
Did you sign her cheque?
Close your eyes.
Hello, gorgeousness.
No one taught you to knock?
Actually, no.
I just wanted to ask
whether it hurt too much.
Hurt when?
When you fell from Heaven.
Why are you knocking
when the door is open?
Because that's what gentlemen do.
Please come in.
You called me.
You two haven't been
introduced properly.
This is Satyakumar.
Failed novelist but in future..
..he's going to be
a super-hit script writer.
Because he's met me. - Hi.
I read your last novel.
You read books?
And scripts too.
If you had sent
your script on time..
..I would've read that too.
I should go. - Yes.
Anyway, we've already
talked too much.
And anyway, you've to
get ready for the after-party.
The entire cast

And the two supporting
actors of our film..
..Monali and Maddy,
you can meet them too.
Sorry, I can't.
I've to visit the mental
asylum tomorrow morning.

Ragini?
Why do you want to meet Ragini?
Research, obviously.
So if you will excuse me, goodnight.
Research?

Yes, sir, he has.

And I am going to take
you behind the scenes..
..of India's most awaited film,
Ragini MMS 2.
I know that you all want
to see Sunny Leone, and not me.
Anyway, the rest of the
film unit will arrive tomorrow.
Till the while we
will control and do.
And you know that the
joy of a horror film set..
..it's best experienced
alone at night.
Let's check it out and be scared.
Ragini MMS, Day zero.
Come.
What is this?
What is this?
Why has this not been
painted for shooting?
This does not look proper.
Who's that?
Who's that?
What is here?
This room seems familiar, right.
This is the same room
where Uday and Ragini..
Someone make my MMS too.
What the hell is this?
Handcuffs, and pink.
Uday, you are a scoundrel.
And Ragini, you're kinky too.
I've got to watch
Ragini's MMS on this bed.
Oh yeah.
Dirty little thing.
Who's there?
Who is trying to be funny?
Who's in the cupboard?
Who's that?
Who's that?
You know Ragini?
Be careful.
Hi, Ragini.
I am Sunny.
We're making a film..
..about what happened
with you and Uday.
And..I am playing Ragini.
Tell me, Ragini, people say..
..there's something in that house.
There's a witch in that house.
She killed Uday.
She won't spare me either.
She will kill me too.
She's right here.
Standing behind me.
She will kill me. Save me. - Ragini.
Ragini, there's no one behind you.
- No, no, please save me.
Ragini, there's no one behind you.
No, no.
Ragini, calm down.
I killed him.
I killed him.
His blood was accumulating
near my feet.
Ragini..
I was enjoying it.
I killed him.
Please save me.
Please save me.
Standing behind me.
Ragini, there's no one behind you.
Please save me. - Calm down.
I'm not a witch.
Ragini, I am sorry.
I didn't kill my children.
What are you doing?
Nurse.
Ragini, no!
Ragini, no!
Come.
Doctor, I know what
happened with Ragini.
We all know what
happened with Ragini.
She attacked herself.
That's what I am trying to say,
doctor.
She didn't attack herself.
She was compelled to do it.
- What do you mean?
Doctor.
I'll handle it. - Yes.
Yes.
Doctor, please listen to me once.
Come sit.
Let's sit and talk.
Tell me.
Doctor,
I know you won't believe me.
And I was trying to explain to Dr.
Batra that..
Ragini's cell is colder than normal.
Ragini feels no sensation.
Cold and hot..
Pain.
Ragini keeps repeating
the same action all the time.
And the doctors are treating her..
..for multiple
personality disorder.
Look, there's no one
solution for such problems.
Every case is different.
And to know that..
..we've to get to
the root of the problem.
Don't worry, give me some time.
Excuse me. - Yes, ma'am.
Who is she?
She's Dr. Meera Dutta.
She just arrived
from New York last week.
She's a bit strange, but..
..she's one of the best
psychiatrist in the world.
Why strange?
Because she chooses
only those cases..
..for which medical
science has no answer.
Hello, gorgeousness.
Is it hot or is it just you.
Hi.
I am sorry,
he's the original spoilsport.
What happened?
Upset over something?
Nothing.
I just got a headache.
Since I met Ragini..
..I am feeling a bit sick.
That's bound to happen
if you meet a psycho.
Stay with normal people.
And you will stay happy.
And you think you're normal?
Stop the car.
What's written here?
No admission before
sunrise or after sunset.
What's that? - No entry.
Nonsense.
It's an ASI signboard, Rocks.
It must mean something.
- Who is ASI?
ASI means the Archaeological
Survey of India.
I've read that they
put up such signs..
..when some place
is actually haunted.
The Bangar and Ajabghar forts..
..in Rajasthan have the same signs.
You're terrified for no reason.
I am sure my over-enthusiastic
art department must have set this up.
For the shoot.
You mean we're about
to reach the location? - Yes.
It's just two minutes away.
Couldn't you find a
jungle close to the city?
Ask Satya that.
It was his mind-blowing
idea to shoot in this bungalow.
Shall we?
Yes.
Hey, writer. Let's go.
Rocks, a house at
such a place is fine?
The house is a dungeon
from the outside..
..but from inside it
is as beautiful as you.
""Ragini""
Are we all going to stay here?
Not all. Only the important people.
And the rest of all crew?
The rest of the crew
will stay at a hotel.
Because they think
there is a witch here.
What if there is really a witch here?
Then we'll cast her
in this movie too.
The rooms here are good, right?
They are better than the hotel which
is 2:30 hours away from here.
'Stay miles away from the house.'
'That house is jinxed.'
'Keep away from that house.'
Mr. Rocks, I want to
discuss few ideas with you.
Mr. Rocks,
I have doubts about my character.
Shall we discuss them?
Mr. Rocks, don't you think that..
..the graph of my
character's a bit down.
Although my character
has many shades.
Red, blue, grey, magenta.
Oh no!
It's got no feelings.
Mood. Mood.
What is the sunshine of my character?
This is my room. - I can see that.
Right.
This one's my favourite.
Favourite.
It was a hit show.
PKGSNR.
What?
""Pyaar Ke Geet Sunaja Re.""
Right after I left the show..
..the channel had
to shut down the show.
My fans messed up everyone.
Why are you asking all this?
Are you a journo? - Journo?
Smarty with pony.
You're a fan.
You want an autograph?
Take my photograph, okay.
Take it.
I am looking for my room. - Room?
Your room.
I see. So you're an AD.
Look, Mr. AD.
This is the VIP area, okay.
Actor zone.
Now get out.
Now leave. Goodbye.
On your way out tell the spot boy..
..to get me a sandwich and a tea.
Brown bread and green tea.
He has come to take a room.
Excuse me, Satya,
I've been looking all over for you.
If I would get my cheque then
I would discuss with you.
Satyakumar?
Satyakumar.
The Satyakumar.
Excuse me.
If I can get a copy of my scenes..
..then I could practice.
No one introduced us.
Parvinder Dhillon.
Friends call me Maddy.
I have many doubts about a scene.
Can I clarify it with you?
She has just one scene.
Sir, talk to me.
I am sending you my BBM pin.
Kindly please add me.
Tell me your pin first.
Then we'll discuss my scenes.
Along with emotions.
Give me your pin.
Tell me. - I am thinking of
getting a new phone today.
Without internet.
Rascal.
But how will I contact you?
Busy?
A lot.
Fine.
Then I won't take
much of your time.
Look, as soon as
I write your scenes..
..I'll keep giving it to you.
What problem do you have with me?
I don't have a problem with you.
But the fact is you're
wrong for this film.
I can't believe you just said that.
Because I feel I am a
complete misfit for this role.
But I didn't think anyone
had the guts to say that to me.
My mother always says.
That I always speak the truth.
It's all her fault.
She shouldn't have named you Satya.
I tell her the same thing.
Well, at least
we agree on something.
Yes.
Friends?
Friends?
Shall we go down?
Everyone's waiting.
And then Monali sees the witch.
Hey, leave the witch,
where is the heroine? - Sir.
Yes. Yes.
Because I have met Ragini.
That's why I feel that at that time
I will feel a bit disappointed.
Yes, when I had met her..
Her face had a different expression.
So I wish to bring that
expression in my acting.
What do you think?
It's so worst.
Look at your face.
It's sulking.
As if you've missed
one of my big episodes.
What can this writer do?
I'll go straight to Rocks, best.
All your actors either
go to directors or writers?
What about us actors?
Excuse me.
As you know I've 2 BF's
in Lokhandwala back-lane.
I will compromise

Patwardhan Villa.
Dahanu, Maharashtra.
Built in 1920.
One of India's haunted houses.
The locals say they
often feel a presence here..
..as if the house doesn't
want anyone to enter inside.
Many deaths have been reported here
in the last 100 years.
The last reported incident
was Ragini and Uday.
Infact A.S.I have put a
board outside this house.
That after sunset
and before sunrise..
..no admission inside.
What could have happened here?
Patwardhan, spice merchant.
100 years ago,
he was India's leading chili trader.
He had got this bungalow
made for his family.
Who...is this woman?
And why has her face
been cut out in every picture?
Is she Patwardhan's wife?
Oh my, God!
That means children were sacrificed?
Come in.
Listen.
Excuse me, sorry. Not today please.
I've already taken my eye-lash off.
So? - So I cannot hookup with you.
Crazy woman,
my lighter's not working.
I came here for that.
As if I am the only one in this house
that has a lighter?
Will you?
Such a bore?
Take it.
Give me one.
Now you're asking for a drag.
Next you'll ask for something else.
Don't mind,
but I don't want anything from you.
Thanks.
That's what all the
girls say in the beginning.
Did you hear? - Yes, your blabber.
Turn around.
Someone just passed by here.
There's someone behind you.
Yes, you're behind
me since we came here.
First you were crazy.
Now get lost from here.
Now get out.
Please, look behind.
I saw someone.
Who is it?
There's no one.
So duffer.
If you build muscles
it doesn't make you a macho man.
Coward.
Get out of here.
You've been blabbering nonsense.
I felt like someone..
Okay, please.
Coward, get out from here.
Come on, get out.
So bad.

Excuse me!
What's this? I asked you

Are you freaking mad?
I was in your bathroom?
Do you think I am gay

Only you can answer that, Maddy.
Why are you feeling shy? - Listen.

Cut.
That's talent, sir.
Experience.
That's where you get it from.
She has experience too.
Sir, only from adult movies.
These things don't teach you acting.
Doing an emotional scene means
pushing to the limit.
Sunny.
Maddy.
Imagine there's no one here.
No cameras.
Just you.
And your efforts finally succeed.
What?
I come close to you.
Take off my clothes.
Then take off your clothes and..
..pull your hair, and kiss you.
And what will you do now?
Now do it with feelings.
I'll give you the clue.
Maddy.
Oh, Maddy.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, Maddy.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, Maddy.
Oh, Maddy.
Oh, Maddy.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, Maddy.
What happened, Maddy?
I admit that adult films
don't make you an actor.
But you couldn't
do that much either.
When the blood rushes
back to your brains..
..then answer me.
One more.
Keep that mood on.
Let's do it.
I mean let's go for take.
I think you did the right thing.
Such people don't understand
any other language.
So you're telling me that all the men
on this unit think I am a w***e.
Not all men.
Only those whose brains
are in their pants.
So all men.
No. Not all men.
I am sorry.
It's not my mistake.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
Since I came here I feel strange.
Come with me.
Why do you feel strange?
Are you fine?
I don't know. I mean.
Headache and..
Sunny.
Shall I do your touchup?
Just five more minutes.
Okay.
What happened?
Nothing.
Remember one thing.
No matter what happens,
I won't let anything happen to you.
Okay.
Satya. - Yes.
You were right,
not all men are alike.
Don't want too many lights, got it?
Let's go
Hello, babiness.
Hi.
Come.
Excuse me.
I mean come, sit. Sit.
Come.
Rocks! Rocks!
Why don't you show me the monitor?
I love the director's angle.
Yes.
What will I do now?
We will hang you upside down.
And you've to pretend
as if you saw a witch.
Okay?
Did you rehearse your lines?
Help! Help!
I've been practicing it since
I was a kid. - Yeah, very good.
Come on. Hang her upside down.
Come, come, please.
Please sit.
Come.
Okay, ready.
Stunt boys, lift her.
Save me! Save me!
Okay, turn her upside down.
Save me. Help!
Everyone ready?
Okay, roll sound. - Rolling.
Camera. - Rolling.
Take one.
Action.
Help! Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help!
Very good, very good.
What a performance.
Very good, scream some more. - Help!
Help!
Scream some more. - Save me.
Bring me down - Come on.
Cut it.
Bring her down!
Monali. Monali. - What happened?
Two girls.
Whose two girls?
What are you saying?
Brilliant performance, Monali.
Brilliant.
What an improvisation.
You were in the character.
Wow! I really enjoyed that.
Clap. Clap.
What a performance.
Very good.
Very good.
Amazing, very good.
Enough, shut up.
Pack up.
Come on, guys, move it.
Push, push.
Come on. - Hurry up.
We've to get out of
here before nightfall.
What if it's a night shoot?
We'll see then.
We don't want to spend the
night with ghosts and witches.
You know,
when Rocks came to meet me first..
..he said he's a
big fan of my acting.
What did he say to you?
That he loves my books.
And you believed him?
Basically, he knew that..
..you're the right person
to write Ragini's story.
I knew that.
He never reads any of my books.
Of course he doesn't.
Pandey never even reads his messages.
Are you going to waste
more time on Rocks?
I am thinking about Monali,
not Rocks.
About what happened on the sets?
What if Monali really
saw something on the ceiling?
Monali is a drama queen.
She can do anything for attention.
There are no ghosts here.
Ragini's mother doesn't
think that. - What?
Ragini's mother believes
there's something in this house.
And I should stay
away from this house.
Yet I brought Rocks here.
Now I feel I put
everyone's life in danger..
..for the sake of my career.
Satya, don't be silly.
We're all here for our careers.
Not for you.
If anything happens to anyone..
..then I will never forgive myself.
I don't know about others..
..but something will
definitely happen to you.
If you keep drinking
whiskey at this rate.
Then tomorrow you'll
feel hammers in your head.
Are you stopping
me from drinking? - No.
I am stopping you
from drinking alone.
Careful, madam.
After two drinks, even
boys like me look handsome.
""I've surrendered myself to you.""
""I am yours, only yours.""
""My days are restless,
I spend it tossing around.""
""I want to spend
the night in your arms.""
""My heart speaks to yours.""
""I want to spend
the night in your arms.""
""Come dwell in me.""
""When you touched..I came alive.""
""My desires..found a voice.""
""When you touched..I came alive.""
""My desires..found a voice.""
""I want to spend
the night in your arms.""
""My heart speaks to yours.""
""I want to spend
the night in your arms.""
""Come dwell in me.""
It stopped raining.
Shall we go?
Yes.
Oh my god.
That's strange.
The entire family died.
But Patwardhan only gave the names
of his kids in the obituary.
That's weird.
What about their mother?
Coffee.
Finally. Here comes
my great assistant, Nishant.
Yeah. - Where were you?
Getting coffee beans from Brazil?
What difference does it make?
Even if I had come any later..
..you would've still been here.
Just stuck to your seats.
I don't understand how
you work so extensively.
And you're so busy.
Yet you find time
for these free cases.
I mean what's the idea here, boss?
I am on to something.
Dr. D, ghosts, spirits,
witches, haunted house rumours.
..have been spread by them.
It's the job of Rock's PR machinery.
You know what the
problem with you guys is.
You are too cynical.
Anyway, where's the footage
from Ragini's mental asylum.
I saw it.
I'll show it to you.
Careful.
Ragini's sitting
on her bed like this.
And there are no
expressions on her face.
And she's just rocking
front and back.
For freaking two years.
I mean I died of boredom.
I am so glad you liked it.
I need the tapes
on my table tomorrow.
But listen to.. - Tomorrow.
But listen.. - Yes.
""Ragini""
Who is it?
No please mother.
I'm not a witch.
My back hurts.
Sunny.
I've been looking all over for you.
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
What do you mean?
I hope you haven't
started sleep-walking?
Don't do that.
You'll find the entire
crew walking behind you.
Come on.
Get some rest.
And shoot? - Shoot?
Today's a night-shift.
Today is Rock's special moon night.
Come on.
Dr. D, I think my
life is passing me by.
I told you a thousand times
there's nothing in that video.
There's nothing, nothing, nothing.
And I said until we
don't see all the videos..
..we won't move from here.
Neither you nor me.
Shut up.
Great.
""Ragini""
You lost.
Satya, why are you so grumpy?
Come down, we're all having fun.
Come on.
Come on.
Rocks is cheating and
getting all our secrets out.
You know Tanya and Kunal
are having an affair..
..since the past two months.
Listen, please don't
tell anyone about this.
Don't we have anything else to do?
We aren't going to make
a status update about your affair.
Yes.
Satya, wait, wait.
It's an amazing game.
Amazing.
I tell you..
The game's called 'Never-Ever'.
I have Never-Ever'.
Okay.
So anyone of us will start
a sentence with 'never ever'.
And if you've done it,
then your drink..bottoms up.
Get it?
It's simple.
Like I..I will say..
Yes.
I have never ever
done in an airplane.
So if you've done it in
the airplane, then your drink.
That's it. Right.
Come on.
No one's forcing him.
Come on.
Come on.
There you go, sir.
Ready?
Everyone, ready.
Satya, your turn. Your turn.
I have never ever played this game.
What's the connection
with their clothes?
Punishment.
If you don't take sip
in a 'never-ever' turn..
..then you're punished.
All and all it's a drinking game.
If someone doesn't
sip in your round..
..then you can punish him.
What happened, babiness?
Where are you lost?
I am just waiting
for my life to leave me.
Why did I just say that?
Now my turn, please.
Now come on you say..
I have never ever,
ever killed anyone.
Kill what?
Are you crazy?
What is the problem?
I got this, guys. Got this.
Sunny took a sip
because everyone says..
..that she can kill with her looks.
Kill-bill.
Rocks is so funny, right.
Monali, you said this only
for getting punished, right?
Come on, guys.
A big punishment for Monali.
- I told you.
Oh no. Now I'll have
to take my dress off, right?
Come on.
No, no, no, wait.
What's your problem? Don't worry.
Take it off. - No, no, sir.
We said..you'll get a punishment.
We haven't said which punishment.
Your punishment is.. - Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.
I will decide Monali's punishment.
And Monali's punishment will be..
..that she will
have to kiss someone.
And who?
Me..
Let me see.
Sunny.
Me? Why?
You just broke a rule.
You took a sip at I
never ever killed anyone.
Unless you really killed someone.
I haven't yet.
But I could kill you
for making me do this.
If you do this.. I am ready to die.
Get ready to die.
Come on kiss me.
Come on.
Cut it or I'll spill it.
That was..awesome.
Wow!
Thank you. - Superb!
Whether she dies or not..
..but I will definitely
die of happiness.
But if I die then who
will s***w all of you.
Come on. Party over.
Come on.
Kunal. - Yes, sir.
Why hasn't the unit's
bus arrived yet?
Sir, I've already called thrice.
But they aren't answering.
Then call someone else in the bus.
The moon will be out soon,
we cannot delay.
We shouldn't be late.
She's right. - Yes sir.
Everybody, come on.
Back to work.
Gina. - Yes.
Blood, acts, handcuffs? - Handcuffs.
Oh no, give me five.
Ma'am.
Ma'am.
I came to say that I've
to go home early today.
Why do you want to go early?
Didn't I tell you, ma'am?
I am fasting today.
Tonight evil powers are worshiped.
What happened? Scared?
Do you believe in
ghosts and spirits?
Sir, I believe in God..
..so we should believe
in evil powers as well.
Today's a full moon night.
Tonight evil powers
are at their full strength.
That's why we observe
fasts and hold venerations..
..to calm them.
B****t. This is all b****t.
Madam, I think this girl
has been possessed by a witch.
How do you know? - Dr. D.
Please don't start again.
If this goes on, then you two..
..will have to spend the night here.
I don't know about your witch,
but my witch..
I mean my girlfriend
will chew me alive.
Try to understand.
Sir, this is no joke.
Ma'am, there's a saying in sect..
..that a witch posses someone..
..when she wants to narrate
her incomplete story.
Oh really. Is it so?
So how does she narrate her story?
Backwards.
Whenever she possesses
someone's body..
..she speaks backwards.
She never speaks normally.
Of course.
Get me my food. - Yes, ma'am.
Nishant, you want to go home, right.
- Yes, Dr. D.
Go home we'll continue tomorrow.
Dr. D, take some break
from the ghosts. Good night
I'm not a witch, I love my son.
But I just love my son.
I'm not a witch,
I'm not killed my daughter.
I don't believe it.
- I'm not a witch.
What did she say?
I like my daughters.
But I just love my son.
I'm not a witch.
I like my daughters.
I like my daughters.
But I just love my son.
I used to fast every Monday.
For five years I fasted every Monday.
After that my son was born.
I will never forget
that inauspicious day.
Their father had gone
out of the city for some work.
Here I come.
All three were playing hide-and-seek.
And then suddenly I heard her scream.
Mother!
By the time I came, it was too late..
I was not aware of anything.
I could not understand anything.
I was wondering why
my son is not getting up.
For hours, like a crazy person,
I held him in my arms..
..and sang lullabies to him.
And then someone gave me some hope.
And your biggest duty is sacrifice.
I had gone so crazy
in the sorrow of my son..
..that I did not even hear
the screams of my daughters.
Hold this.
Shut your eyes and say the chants.
The word spread in the village.
The Tantric ran away from
there at that very moment.
And for the villagers
I became such a mother
..at the hands of which..
She's a witch!
Killed her own daughters.
They hung me from a tree.
I kept screaming..
yes, I have made a very big mistake..
..but I am not a witch.
I've not killed my daughter.
I've not killed my daughter.
- I'm not a witch.
No one heard my voice.
Not even their father.
I am just a mother.
Who was sad about her daughters..
Mother!
I will not spare anyone.
This is my house.
I will not spare anyone.
Mother!
I'm not a witch.
I'm not a witch.
This is my house.
I will not go from here.
Mother!
Mother!
Tonight this witch
won't spare anyone.
She won't spare anyone alive.
She won't spare anyone.
I won't let it happen.
I will have to do something.
I'll be right back.
How are all of you?
Who's under the bed?
Come out.
Who's there?
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!
Someone's playing with me.
Who's there?
Sunny.
In the morning you won round 1.
But I am a specialist in round 2.
I am coming.
To have some fun in the jungle.
Where is it? Where have I kept it?
Today I'll show her real man force.
Shall we?
And he had to resign from his post.
And in the news,
in Rane Mental Asylum today..
..a death happened in
a strange manner.
The one who died..
producer and director Rocks..
..was making a film
based on her life.
We are talking about that person..
..whose MMS was leaked
some years back.
Recently Ragini was
in the news again..
..when famous film director Rocks..
..announced a film on her.
But unfortunately,
Ragini can never see this film.
Along with Ragini's death..
..her dreadful story is over too.
Hello.
Hello, aunty, this is Satya.
Yes. - Aunty, I am very sorry.
I don't know what to say.
No need to say anything, Satya.
I tried explaining to you.
But no one listened to me.
Ragini wasn't crazy.
The truth is...that she
was possessed by a witch.
Aunty, even if we believe..
..that Ragini was
possessed by a witch..
..then where did she go?
I pray that she went
back to where she came from.
Aunty...
Aunty, when did Ragini die?
Four days ago.
Four days ago..
- The heroine of your film..
..came to see my daughter.
The same day.
'Since the day I met Ragini..
'There's something in this house.'
Aunty, the mark on Ragini's arm.
The mark vanished from her arms too.
How can a mark vanish
from a person's arm, Satya?
The mark hasn't vanished,
neither has the witch.
Hello. - Thank god.
Hello, Mrs. Shinde.
Yes Doctor, tell me.
I want to talk to someone
in that house now.
I will send Satya's number right now.
Sunny.
Sunny.
Where are you hiding?
That's..
Sunny.
That's..
Strip-tease with me.
I am a TV star.
Whenever I shoot
a wedding night scene..
..the show gets full TRP.
Where are you?
Sunny dear, come to papa.
Come on..
Sunny.
Sunny.
Sunny.
Sunny.
Sunny.
I..
Out in the open, in the lake.
Fine with me.
Why feel shy from mother nature?
Sunny Leone, give it to me.
Sunny, I'm coming.
The water is very cold, no problem.
Sunny will heat it.
I'm coming.
Hold my hand.
Where are you?
Hey, this donkey has come.
Sunny.
I have caught you, come outside.
The number you're
trying to reach is busy.
Please call later.
Hello. - Rocks,
listen to me carefully.
It's a matter of life and death.
Whose? Yours or mine?
It's Sunny.
She is possessed.
She's been possessed by a witch.
And you've gone crazy.
Rocks.
Rocks.
""Ragini""
Excuse me.
He said he's my BF
and you believed him.
You know he was
my neighbour in Delhi.
That's why we're so
frank with each other.
So please don't be so jealous.
You've to choose today.
Either him or me.
What choice?
Please, Manish.
Don't be so jealous.
I've been a tomboy
since I was a kid.
So all the boys are
very comfortable with me.
All boys.
You've found someone
on the sets as well, right?
Are you crazy?
Are you mental?
Monali, it's too much now.
I know that you..
- Listen to me, okay.
I need a secured
boyfriend for myself.
Not insecure ones like you.
Okay.
I know you're definitely
up to someone on the sets.
I know this very well.
Excuse me, I am not cheating on you.
Please don't be a fool.
Oh no!
You've spoiled my mood.
Go to hell. - Monali, listen to me.
All men are like that.
Worst.
Rocks!
Hello, babiness.
I never told you that
I am your biggest fan.
In fact, I was just watching..
..your doctor-nurse
video in my room.
And then I thought to myself,
""Rocks..
..you are an idiot"".
You're right here and
I am watching a video.
And so...I came to say..
Hello, sweetness.
Feeling shy.
Don't be shy.
It's only me.
I'm not a witch.
Dirty talking in Marathi.
But I don't know Marathi.
Say it in English.
Say f**k me.
Say it.
Say f**k me.
F**k me!
But you..
I think I should drink less vodka.
What am I doing on you?
What am I doing?
What do you mean?
Look, let's not pretend
with each other anymore.
No one will ever know..
..whatever happens
in this room tonight.
Not even your writer boyfriend.
Rocks, what are you..
Now f**k me.
F**k.
Rock's voice from Sunny's room.
Rocks!
Oh no. What's going on?
This is bad.
Compromise.
The heroines these days, I tell you.
They are so bad.
Now I'll make Ragini MMS 3.
Threesome, here I come.
Rocks!
Can I kindly join?
Rocks.
Rocks.
That Sunny..
She's possessed. - She killed Rocks.
She's possessed.
Meaning?
She's possessed.
It's okay.
Satya.
Hi, I am Dr. Meera Dutta.
Ragini's psychiatrist.
What are you doing here?
We don't have time.
There's a spirit trapped here.
If we don't free her soon..
..she won't let anyone go from here.
We'll have to do something about it,
and quick.
Please.
Keep quiet.
Sorry.
It's coming from
behind the cupboard.
Satya.
You all are coming?
We cannot leave from
here even if we wish to.
She will not let us leave.
Carefully.
Can't see anything.
Come here.
What are you doing?
Calm down.
I thought as much.
We'll have to perform
their final rites..
..or their souls
won't attain salvation.
Do whatever you want, doctor.
Just save Sunny, please.
I am a doctor, Satya.
But I will try my best.
Last year I met
a sage in Rishikesh..
..and he gave me few mantras..
..which separates
the soul from the body.
I never thought they
would be of some use, but..
..I guess that's our last straw now.
Are you sure these
mantras will work?
Right now there's
just one thing we can do.
Believe.
It has to. - Yes.
Please do fast, doctor.
Monali!
Monali, get the chair.
Monali!
Oh no!
I will not spare anyone.
Tie her up.
Carefully.
Satya, we don't have time.
Let me go.
If I don't read these
mantras quickly..
..then she won't go.
What's the point of
tying me to the chair?
All three are going to attack me?
Come on, baby. Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Satya, what happened?
Come on, take me now.
F**k me.
There's no use.
Carefully.
Please help me.
Please help me.
It hurts.
Please help me.
Please help me.
Satya, please help me.
I'm not a witch.
I didn't kill my son.
He's mine.
I won't go from here.
Go away from here.
Return to the darkness
you have come from.
Sunny. - Wait.
Wait. - She's dead, Satya.
Sunny.
I think she's dead.
Sunny.
Sunny.
Monali.
Her life's stuck in that.
We'll have to break that, Satya.
No, Sunny. No.
Satya, don't listen to her.
Just break it right now.
Don't do that.
Satya, don't listen to her.
What if something happens to Sunny?
Nothing will happen to Sunny.
That's not Sunny. - I love you.
I said break it.
Don't do that. - Come on, Satya.
Break that.
Hold it.
Sunny.
Sunny. - Sunny.
Sunny.
Sunny, get up.
Sunny, open your eyes. - Sunny!
Sunny!
Sunny!
It's okay.
Please take me away from here.
Yeah.
Please take me away from here.
Are you okay?
Satya.
As soon as you two get
out I'll call the police.
He'll do the final
rites of everyone.",34560

Ali, an orphaned poor Muslim man, gets fired from a clothing store after he insults a kid who turns out to be the owner's son. He worries that he won't be able to earn money anymore to take care of his Hindu mother, Sulbha but his friend Maqsood motivates him. They approach a rich and royal woman, Padmavati, for money, but manage to do it only after a fight with her. Maqsood, it is shown, works for a gangster, Danger Bhai.

Ali is all set to be married but the alliance is broken when the clothing store owner recognizes him and turns out to be a close relative of the bride's family. Dejected, Ali visits a golf course to get some money from a businessman named Singhania. Unaware of what he is up to, Ali pokes fun at Singhania, who challenges him to hit an ace. Ali accepts his challenge and wins it, returning home after collecting the money. Ali's uncle, Kishan Lal, who is a caddy driver for Singhania, tells Ali that if he plays golf he can get rich and become a champion. Motivated by this, he begins training under Kishan's tutelage.

Ali contests a golf tournament, and in the process, falls for royal champion Vikram Rathore's manager Megha, who praises his performance, while Vikram chides him. Ali pays the entry fee and qualifies for the top 60 players. Vikram soon fires Megha and shows his arrogance to Ali, but he retaliates, telling him that golf could be a game for the poor too. He begins winning a number of matches and earns enough money to take care of Sulbha; Megha grows close to him and Sulbha in the process.

Danger Bhai, upon the behest of his elder brother, Bade Bhai, tricks and blackmails Maqsood to hijack Ali's success, and a misled Maqsood cunningly substitutes himself for Kishan, misguiding Ali into losing matches. When Megha finds this out, Maqsood's cover is blown and Ali walks away in anger after slapping him. He tries to explain why he was doing this, but Sulbha lectures Maqsood on the importance of honesty. Maqsood regrets and decides to help Ali. Vikram injures Ali's hand on the pretext of congratulating him for getting to the finals; everyone feels worried and starts praying. Ali comes back to the final event with an injured hand which is recovering currently. Bade Bhai joins Danger Bhai, who in turn joins Vikram.

Maqsood tells Vikram that he may have broken Ali's hand, but he can't break his courage, and Maqsood becomes the new caddy. Ali gets inspired by his mother, who hits back at Danger Bhai and Bade Bhai for trying to insult her son. Ali then during the match gains his confidence back, removes plaster-bandage and plays perfectly. When Maqsood asks Ali what he's going to do, Ali tells him that he's going to ""hit a six like in cricket"". Ali executes a great shot flying above the tree and into the hole and Ali wins. Vikram accepts his defeat and lets him go. Bade Bhai praises Ali and declares that he will end all his illegal businesses, and Ali celebrates his victory with his friends and Megha.",2976,NA,NA,NA
"39","tt9248972","Mission Mangal",2019,"Plot

Across the landscapes of Bengaluru, India, at ISRO, after the failed launch of GSLV-F06 on 25 December 2010, due to a miscalculation by Project Director Tara Shinde (Vidya Balan), Rakesh Dhawan[a] (Akshay Kumar), a fellow scientist working with her, takes the blame for the mistake. As a result, he is relocated to work on Mangalyaan (Mars-craft) as punishment, where Tara joins him out of guilt. The new GSLV missions are given to Rupert Desai (Dalip Tahil), an ex-NASA scientist of Indian origin. The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) is thought of as an impossible mission by his coworkers due to its aim of reaching Mars with its tight budget.

Rakesh learns that the MOM cannot take off on the PSLV since the available technology has a payload of only 1500 kg and not enough fuel to fire the rocket to be carried to a distance of almost 55 million kilometres. GSLV, if it had succeeded, could have taken the satellite to Mars as it had a payload of 2300 kg. However, recent significant failures of GSLV have jeopardised the planned future missions.

Tara is also caught up at home between constant feuds between her husband Sunil and her son Dilip, the latter showing an interest in his namesake A. R. Rahman and Islam. Dilip has another interest in the Mars Mission. One day, when Tara has to make pooris and runs out of gas, she plans to cook the rest with the flame off. This sparks an idea on using minimal fuel on the PSLV vehicle, to reach Mars. With reluctance, opposing Rupert assigns a junior team to Rakesh and Tara.

The junior scientists' team comprises: Eka Gandhi (Sonakshi Sinha), a propulsion control expert, who is looking for any chance to get away to NASA; Neha Siddiqui (Kirti Kulhari), a spacecraft autonomy designer, who is struggling with rejection as a result of her intercommunal background despite her divorce while trying hard to find a house; Kritika Aggarwal (Taapsee Pannu), a navigation expert who is also a devoted wife to her army husband Rishi (Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub), while trying hard to get a driving license; Varsha Pillai (Nithya Menen), the satellite designer and payload expert, who faces her mother-in-law's taunts for being unable to conceive a child; Parmeshwar Joshi (Sharman Joshi), the payload expert, who relies more on the religious priest and his advice but subsequently develops a romantic interest in Eka; and Ananth Iyengar (H. G. Dattatreya), the team's structural engineer, who is trying to complete his pilgrimage to Tirumala with his wife.

After the announcement of India's second Moon mission, Chandrayaan-2, the mission's budget is cut by 50%; in between the tight schedule and minuscule budget, Tara and Rakesh continue to work on their MOM project by making several compromises, even as Kritika abruptly abandons her duties without informing the duo upon learning that Rishi has been severely wounded in action. Tara and Rakesh realise that the rest of the junior scientists working on the project have low morale and motivation to make this mission happen, leading to the team slowing down. Tara soon realises that in order to meet their budget and schedule, she must make the team members change their attitudes, and motivate them to make their dream jobs into a reality. An attempt on her part to pacify her worried husband, Sunil by tracing their daughter Anya, who hasn't arrived home yet, to a night club, eventually culminates in Sunil warming up to the party environment as he throws a comment about nostalgia. This strikes an idea in Tara's head, and the next day, she successfully motivates the team members by reminding them of their childhood passion for science, and they put all their hardwork and energy into resolving the issues with the mission to make it happen. Meanwhile, even as Kritika returns on being reminded by Rishi that she has a duty towards her country too, just like him, Varsha happens to be pregnant and soon delivers a child, for whom the team makes arrangements at the office itself, while Neha is warmly taken in by Ananth and his wife into their house (where Ananth helps her move on with her troubled past as a wife).

The MOM satellite is finally launched on PSLV on 5 November 2013 (after an 8-day delay due to weather), and is named Mangalyaan (Sanskrit: Mars-Craft) and is successfully inserted into Earth's orbit. Rakesh and his team celebrate the successful launch. However, while doing the sixth orbit-raising manoeuvre, the jets fail to launch, pushing the mission six days behind. Rupert mocks the team, while Tara continues to keep hope that something will happen. A couple months later, on the way to Mars, the satellite is hit by a solar radiation wave, which heavily damages its communication systems. When the team manages to regain communications, they realise that the solar radiation had increased the speed of the satellite and pushed it further, making up the six day gap they had incurred while doing the orbital manoeuvres with Earth. After spending a 298-day transit to Mars, MOM satellite is inserted into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014, making India the 4th country in the world to do so and the first country to do it in the first attempt.

Figs is the typical cynic who lurks in the expansive lawns of Delhi University. Entangled in a web of drugged out delirium, he’s the quintessential rebel. His world is thrown into disarray when his conservative parents begin to chalk out a strategy for his future. Things only become worse when a sudden scarcity of hash deprives Figs of his favourite pastime. Unable to cope with the situation, Figs joins forces with his best friend Maggie on a quest to attain M Cream, a mythical form of hash. They hastily devise a plan to trek to the far reaches of the Himalayas in pursuit of this goal. Maggie ropes in her boyfriend Niz, who’s purportedly headed to the hills on a photo assignment. Unbeknownst to Figs, the trio is joined by Jay, a close friend of Niz. Chaos ensues as the reckless travelers journey across the Himalayan expanse. The road trip results in a series of unexpected encounters that begin to unravel the myriad realities of rebellion. Difficult choices are made and uncomfortable sides are taken as Figs and the others begin to comprehend the mysterious ways of the world we live in.",1107,NA,NA,NA

Gulrez ""Gullu"" Qadir, a spirited salesgirl from a lower-middle-class neighborhood in Hyderabad, lives with her widowed father, Abdul Qadir, and dreams of emigrating to the United States. Despite her aspirations, her marriage prospects are limited due to their inability to meet steep dowry demands. When her relationship with Amjad collapses after his family demands ₹80 lakhs as dowry, Gullu becomes disillusioned.

Determined to fight back, Gullu devises a scheme to entrap a dowry-seeking groom under IPC Section 498A, which penalizes dowry harassment. She and her father assume false identities and travel to Lucknow, where they target Tariq ""Taru"" Haider, the charismatic owner of the popular restaurant ""Haidari Kebab."" During their courtship, Taru and Gullu grow close, and Gullu is taken aback when Taru gives her ₹40 lakhs from his personal savings to meet his father's dowry demand—ensuring that the money does not actually come from her family.

Despite developing feelings for Taru, Gullu executes her plan: she drugs him on their wedding night and absconds with the money. She subsequently blackmails the Haider family for an additional ₹40 lakhs under the threat of dowry charges. As she prepares to leave for America, guilt overcomes her. At the train station, she is confronted by Taru. Gullu returns the money, confesses her love, and apologizes. Taru forgives her, and they reunite, deciding to marry without dowry.

The film concludes with Gullu starting her own shoe boutique named ""GULLU,"" while Amjad, moved by her journey, confronts his own parents about their dowry expectations.",1609,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt3398052.srt","Slow slow, it's on the right...

My Gullu topped the whole
Andhra state in the 12th grade.
She is a Gold medallist,
look at her certificates.
She even got admission
in an American college.
Poor girl didn't
get a scholarship...
...or she would be
studying there right now.
Along with the job,
she's doing her B. Com as well.
As soon as she finishes
her third year...
...she will become

Fifteen is bit on the lower side.

...congratulations brother.
Let's go Mummy.
What happened Montu?
I said let's go,
these people are wasting our time.
I don't want them,
I don't want this match.
But what happened my son?
What happened is that
your Mr. Montu is a fraud...
His bio data said,
fluent in English...
...but he says 'bilu' for blue
and 'flim' for film...
He asked me if I watch bilu flim...
Tell me Booji...
...how do I answer to that...
...if his pronunciation
of blue film is so wrong!
And for Education qualification,
he wrote degree from llM.
IIM means?
Indian Institute of Management...
International Institute
of Mahbubnagar.
Mr. Bad-english-bilu-flim-
fake-diploma-holder- Montu...
You have wasted our time!
Wasted out time, tang, samosa,
chips, biscuitmeverything!
And your mummy...
...she's been making faces
over everything since she's come...
Gullu!
Take her away quickly
before her face permanently...
...becomes like this...
Gulrez, Pooja... don't misbehave.
Come on, let's go! Come on Montu!
Who will wed such a bratty,
dark-skinned...
...uncouth, ugly-looking girl?
Bye Montu...
Bye
Sister, our Gullu is just joking...
She's just a kid... Please
don't leave, she will say sorry...
Please hear me out...
Ismail bhai... Bhabhi...
- Montu...
- I came here because of you
What did I know they are beggars...
...everyone said
they are very well known...
Such a long resume he had sent
and not one thing was true
Booji, snacks?
Today if your mother was alive...
She would say,
Mr. Qadir...have a samosa.
You just keep eating samosas
What is the samosa's fault?
Booji has gone sad and
the samosas have gone cold!
Gullu!
Gullu!
It's quarter past seven
Slalekum...
...slalekum...
Oh, still in bad mood...
Tea not sweet?
Gullu, it's quarter past eight,
come for breakfast.
Booji... come on,
we're getting late...
I've been waiting so long...
You always delay us...
Bhai Miyan Slalekum!
Slalekum
Stand straight,
you'll be late for school.
Gullu, you dismissed
another case last night?
Yes Aunty...and in record time!
- Namaste brother
- Namaste
Ready Booji?
Let's go.
Booji, soon as we have
loads of money...
...we will buy a big bungalow
and settle down in Jubilee Hills.
There will be no Rukmani aunty or
Bilqees aunty to trouble us there.
Are you listening?
Booji?
Radha-Raja Reddy case result
will be declared today, right?
What do you think? Who will win?
Radha or Raja?
Say something.
I don't know. Drive quietly.
Booj! How can I marry some
'bilu film' watching fraud?
All I'm asking for is an intelligent
husband, is that too much?
If one has just enough money
for a handful of oilyjalebis...
...one can't buy a kilo
of Pula Reddy's...
mexpensive pure-ghee gulab jamuns.
With the dowry that I can give...
...we will only find
these bad-English types.
How do I get an Oxford dictionary
product for fifteen lakhs?
Then why did you send me
to a private English medium...
...you should have sent me
to a Government school.
I wouldn't have gotten
addicted to English.
Or you should have married me off
right after school.
You know lesser the age,
lesser the dowry!
If I had married you off at sixteen
wouldn't I have been jailed?
Won't you be jailed
for giving dowry?
What can one do about that...
In our country you can't buy a
house without paying black money...
...and you can't get married
without dowry.
God knows how many baby girls
are killed everyday...
...by their own parents.
You too should have given me
rat poison, with gulabjamun.
The whole dowry head-ache
would be over.
Don't talk nonsense.
Only two years left
for my retirement.
Soon as you get hitched,
I can rest easy.
Hitched? I don't want
to get sorted Booji
Yes, you just want to unsettle me!
Everylhing will be fine, just stop
bringing jerks to marry me off.
Of course Gulluji,
the boys I call are all jerks.
You only want Mr. World...
...no Miss World?
Why Mr. World,
I'll get Mr. Universe.
Sure you will!
- Khuda Hafiz.
- Khuda Hafiz.
Mr. Qadir...Sir,
please hear me out...
Sir, you are the senior-most
clerk in the registrar's office...
...you can postpone my boss's
court date if you want.
You will profit in exchange.
I don't want your profit.
Sir, cash or kind, your choice.
You can take the whole family
on a vacation to America.
Recently Mr. Mudgil
took his family there...
I said no! Now get out of here!
You moron!
The date will get changed anyhow.
Mr. Qadir... why so stressed?
They are openly
spreading corruption!
Forget about him. Want to bet
on the Raja Radha Reddy case?
It's a bet! Raja Reddy
will get six years in jail.
What are you saying Mr. Qadir?
Raja Reddy supplies milk
to the whole state...
...he's the 'Milk King'...
Nobody is king
when it comes to 498a.
Radha Reddy has filed a case of
dowry harassment under section 498a.
There is no bail in 498a, and
if the husband is found guilty...
...he goes straight to jail.
Mr. Supreme Court, you will lose.
We'll see who wins!
Radha Reddy, victorious in the dowry
harassment case, thanks to 498a.
The power of 498a has delivered
justice to Radha Reddy...
...who has been harassed
in a dowry case.
Her husband Raja Reddy has been
convicted for 6 years in prison.
Radha Reddy Ma'am, your husband
has got a 6 year jail term...
...how does it feel?
I am very happy, thanks to 498a.
The honourable judge has sent
my husband to jail...
...ordered him to give me
ten crores cash...
...a flat to live in and four lakhs
monthly alimony.
Long live 498a.
Like you just saw...
You are wasting your time
as a clerk Abdul Qadir...
...you should become an advocate.
You know the law better
than these LLB lawyers...
Once again I will have
to treat you to biryani.
Once again a winner!
Qadir bhai...yourjudge has arrived.
Oh my God!
Good morning sir...
- Good morning...
- Sorry Sir
My foot is sprained, be careful...
Heel is too small...
show me something else...
Ma'am, I've shown you all
the ladies styles in the shop...
...now I can only show you
the gent's shoes, if you like?
Why should I wear gent's shoes?
I don't like anything. I'm leaving.
Ok no problem Ma'am.
You're welcome. Do come again.
I'm leaving this damn job now!
But you love shoes...
I love shoes, but not stupid
customers like that lady.
Relax!
Look, your coffee-shop guy.
He's so handsome!
Whats the use?
We've been saying 'so handsome,
so handsome' since a month.
He doesn't even look here.
We don't exist for cool dudes
like him, poor sales girls like us.
Oh my God Gullu!
He's coming this way...
Hi! AmjadmAmjad Baig.
Gulrez Qadir. How can I help you?!
Am lookin' for a cool pair
for my mum.
Repeat please.
I want to buy shoes...for my mother.
No no... in English.
Your accent is so yummy.
I am looking for a cool pair
for my mum.
- American accent?
- Yeah...
I've been watching you for a month.
And I've been waiting for you to
have the courage to enter the shop.
I'm somewhat of a wimp.
So...your mom's size?
Yes, yes...
Huh!
Cool...come!
Where in America do you live?
New York?
Jubilee Hills... the Hyderabad one.
Born and brought up.
So this American accent?
I work for an American
software company...
...but I'm shifting to
America in three months.
I've got admission in MBA.
New York?
Kalamazoo.
Oh Kalamazoo
Kalamazoo is in the state
of Michigan...
Michigan's capital is Lansing.
Kalamazoo is in the state of
Michigan, Michigan's capital...
Michigan, the capital of Lansing.
Lake Ontario to the west.
East, Lake Erie.
South west is Ohio,
capital Columbus...
...in the south is Indiana,
capital Indianapolis.
And right in the centre will be you,
Kalamazoo!
WOW!
You're quite deep into USA huh?
It was my dream to study
shoe-desgining in America.
But I became a shoe sales-girl here.
I wish we could both go.
Actually, come with me!
You will become a famous
star-shoe designer.
I will do your marketing...
designer brand... Gullu, what say?
Soft, sublime,
The scent is your's-
Let's go?
I am blooming.
Soft, sublime,
The scent is your's-
lam blooming.
Sour, sweet,
The words are your's-
lam chirping.
You're an old longing,
A new playfulness.
Make me believe
Are you for real or not?
Oh my, my tongue is slipping-
I have turned poetic!
I'm humming, I've turned romantic...
I have turned poetic!
Poetic, poetic,
I've turned poetic...
The moon tricks me and walks away,
It appears to me in the day.
It picks new dreams for me...
It pulls me by the arm,
The wind blows me away,
It finds new ways for me.
Poetic, poetic,
I've turned poetic...
You're an old habit,
You're brand new trouble.
Make me believe,
Are you for real or not?
Oh my, my tongue is slipping-
I have turned poetic!
I'm humming, I've turned romantic...
I have turned poetic!
Enough!
I'm hungry...let's eat kababs?
I am a vegetarian.
Really?
Everyone is turning
vegetarian in America.
Amjad! What will we do?
I love you,
but I love Nalli, nahari...
...kabab, biryani,
haleem also very much.
I'm a hard-core non!
So you eat. Yes, you can eat.
Who's stopping you?
All relationships are like
that in America...
...you do what you like,
I'll do what I like.
I really love you!
Remember this my friend...today
I will eat only vegetarian with you.
Gullu...
Let's begin the gift ceremony.
Bride's mother will gift
a brand new car...
Mummy, come on mummy!
Thank you amma
Bride's uncle will gift
two pure gold wrist watches...
One for the left hand,
one for the right.
Very nice dowry
On top of all the gifts...
I have given one crore cash dowry
to Pooja's in laws.
Pooja's husband is an IAS,
that's his rate.
Gullu!
_Amju
<i>~</i> Hi!
The next presentation...
Bride's aunt will gift a gold set.
Give her a big hand!
Please
A mixer griander and 32 inch LED TV
from the bride's uncle in Dubai.
You turned out to be quite brave...
coming here without an invitation.
I missed you!
I was too busy with the wedding...
Pooja wouldn't let go of me...
Gullu! I missed you so much!
Will you have a love
marriage or arranged?
My father will hang me from
the fan if I have a love marriage.
You?
My Booji...should be okay.
Hopefully.
Did you tell Booji about me?
No. Should I?
Should I convince my father
to bring a proposal to your house?
Are you proposing to me?
We've been together
for more than a month.
Okay!
We rejecting boys speaking
English very badly...
For Gullu, only good
English speaking.
Amju-Gullu... Perfect coupling.
You needn't worry about dowry,
we don't want anything.
The love with which Amju has come,
I mean all of you have
come from Jubilee Hills...
...you would obviously not
bring the filth of dowry with you.
Send you daughter in one outfit,
we'll be happy.
We just need some help from you.
Of course. What help?
For his higher education.
I told you...
Yes Kalamazoo!
What a robust name, Kalamazoo.
So... what help can I offer you?
College tuition, travel expenses,
living and food expenses...
...not for him alone...
for the bride as well.
After marriage, we won't force
your daughter to stay with us.
She will also go with Amju.
We are very open minded...
Very good...
Amju, I hear you're a vegetarian?
Here, the help list!
Oh okay...
It's just eight lakhs.
Not eight, eighty.
Eighty!
Please go through it.
It's all accounted.
Every penny will be spent on them.
Nothing on us.
You never said anything
about this Amju?
Have you spoken
to Gulrez before this?
Yes... he's spoken to me,
held my hand...
Said I love you a hundred times.
0k... but the match is being made
with our permission.
It is arranged.
Amju, how can you do this
if you love me...
...how can you ask for money?
This is understood dear.
He will go to America,
get educated, earn millions...
...only you will enjoy the benefits.
We're just asking your father
for some help...
...not asking him
to build the Charminar!
But you are educated,
with an American accent...
...going to do your MBA...
So?
Doctors, engineers,
IAS, IPS, all ask for help.
What's wrong with MBA?
Amju, I'm an ordinary sales-girl,
where will I get eighty lakhs from?
But your father works
at the court...high court!
Yes, but I'm merely a clerk,
not a lawyer.
My salary is only thirty
thousand per month.
I have some jewellery
and cash for the dowry...
Hey, hey, who's asking for dowry...
Help, help!
Sorry help...
I can help up to fifteen lakhs.
Fifteen?
Nowadays even the note-books
cost more in America...
There's a long line of people
waiting to help my Amju.
Not bits and pieces, full help.
Amjad, you won't say anything?
Dad, my education will cost
only sixty lakhs...
...why are you asking for eigthy?
That's unfair.
Unfair? What's unfair?
I pawned my jewellery to send you
to an English medium school...
...now you're misbehaving with us
in fluent English!
I'm Sorry...
- Amju!
- Gullu
My Child!
What kind of misbehaviour is this?
You won't get anything here...
...no burger, no hot-dog,
no cold-drink, no help... Nothing.
Get out of here...
- Get out...out!
- She's gone crazy!
Gullu calm down...
Leave! Just leave!
I love you Gullu.
I hate you Amjad.
Gullu, I want to go
to Kalamazoo with you...
...climb the Statue of Liberty
with you...
Go hang yourself...
bloody vegetarian!
- Gullu! Gullu!
- Let's go!
Mr. Abdul Qadir! This is not right!
Your daughter has made a very
big mistake! A very big mistake!
Get lost...
or I'll beat you to a pulp.
You want help?
Here, take help...take help...
Radha Reddy Ma'am, your husband
has been jailed for six years...
...how does it feel?
I am very happy, thanks to 498a...
The honourable judge
has sent my husband to jail...
...ordered him to give
me ten crores cash...
...a flat to live in and four lakhs
monthly alimony.
Long live 498a.
They cook the most delicious
biryani... Amazing!
Try this piece, it's very tasty...
No, no... I'm done.
With the baghaare baingan...
Ok fine.
Only after giving anaesthesia
of my favourite food...
...from my favourite restaurant,
will you perform surgery...
Out with it...what's up?
Booji, I don't want
to get married at all...
...whether it's a bilu flim cheapster
or an American accent MBA.
Nobody values companionship,
friendship, love, affection...
...they're all just parasites.
All boys are not alike Gullu.
They are Booji, you don't know!
Have your cold-drink.
Anyway, I have decided...
I will fulfill my dreams.
You and I are going to New York.
I will study Fashion Designing,
I will be a famous shoe designer.
You just enjoy!
Come on, which bank will we rob?
We will put 498a, like Radha Reddy.
It's a law, not nail-polish!
We'll use the law.
First, we will change
our name and appearance...
...and post my photo and bio-data
on a matrimonial site.
Boys will line up to marry me.
We will interview them...
...and choose the most
greedy scoundrel.
I will marry him in a fake ceremony.
The next day we will use 498a...
...and file a dowry harassment case
against the groom and his family.
To avoid jail-time they will agree
to an out of court settlement.
We will then ask for eighty lakhs
in cash! They will have to pay up.
We will take that money
and off to New York.
Isn't it a great idea!
You want to bribe me with dinner
to pass this dangerous plan?
There's no danger Booji!
Shut up... just shut up!
Never speak of this
stupid plan again!
Let's go!
You think you're too smart...
trying to use 498a
Booji!
Hey ldrees, clean table number seven
- Slalekum!
- Walekum
My tea today!
You're up very early.
I was planning all night.
We will change our name, dress,
appearance and look for our target.
Not here, everyone knows us
in Hyderabad. In some other city.
Don't start again!
Listen to the full plan at least...
We will go fully prepared.
I've found out the name of the guy
who makes fake passports...
...here in Laad Bazaar,
he'll make it in two days.
Don't worry, I will wear a veil
while giving the photo and money.
- He wont recognize...
- Stop it now!
If Bilqees and Rukmani hear this,
they will report you.
We will have to buy
hundred dirhams...
...we will photocopy those
and make bundles.
What?
We need cash for all this,
so break the dowry deposit.
It will finance the whole mission.
Where did you learn all this from?
The internet has everything...
...from child delivery
to bomb making, all recipes.
Anyway... One minute...
Bhopal, Ahmedabad, Delhi, Lucknow.
- Where do you want to go?
- Jail!
Tell me Booji,
I have to book the tickets.
Booji!
The whole world asks for dowry!
If I con some money out of a greedy
dowry monger, what's the big deal?
In India, one woman is killed
for dowry every hour!
I swear by Google...
see for yourself.
Booji, we've been insulted a lot.
Now we will avenge those insults.
We will fulfill our dreams.
Don't marry, if you don't want to.
If you want to study...
study right here in India.
We have Fashion Designing here too.
I will only study
in the New York College.
If you don't want to help, then
don't. I will do everything myself.
If you commit this crime Gullu...
I will report you myself
and send you to jail.
Ok, I will marry the
""Bilu Flim"" jerk tomorrow.
He will make me watch them as well.
Gullu don't be stubbborn...
Who knows, he will make
a blue film of me!
Then you'll be happy?
Gullu! Gullu!
Gullu won't you say Khuda Hafiz?
Ok don't, I won't either!
Booji! Booji!
Did you get hurt?
What happened?
Don't you know how to drive?
- Sorry, I blew the horn...
- What happened?
- ...but he didn't hear madam...
- I'm alright, it's just a scratch.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Let it be...come let's go.
I should call Mohan Rao.
- Let it be now...
- Should we call an ambulance?
No, thank you so much.
Thank you.
Sir please listen to me.
Sir my father has had an accident,
how can I leave him alone?
It's an emergency leave Sir.
Fine, fire me if you like,
but I can't come today.
Fine.
Idiot!
Come on, don't fuss.
Gullu... If I had been crushed...
you, on your own...?
Why are you scared?
Nothing will happen to you.
I won't trouble you again... Sorry!
Why should you be sorry?
Before something really happens
to me, we will fulfill your dream.
Come on, let's go to New York.
- No Booji, no...
- Yes!
If the whole world is
feeding off dishonesty...
...why should we starve
by being honest?
I couldn't become a lawyer...
...but you will definitely
become a Fashion Designer.
So what's the plan,
where will we go to trap our prey?
Bhopal, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Delhi?
Lucknow.
Good choice partner.
The food is great in Lucknow.
Daddy... stop scratching.
My beard itches...
more so when I'm nervous!
Then scratch stylishly... like this!
Good morning, Sir.
- Daddy, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Sir, my payment?
One...

I'm sorry!
Sorry!
What are you doing?
Keep your hand here.

Dal, 250 rupees! Curry, 500 rupees!
Chapatti, 75 rupees!
Is their barbecue
studded with diamonds?
It's a five star Booji,
so the rates are also five star.
No! I don't like
this waste of money...
See this...dal is 50, veg curry 75,
kofta 50 and roti only 20.

Special feerni here...
You haven't paid, have you?
Hey Mateen, have you
taken their payment?
Yes I have...
Dimwit, can't you see

Are you trying to insult us
by taking money from them?
Go get the money back...
Allow us to pay the bill...
Why will you pay,
you're my father-in-law-uncle!
That will be decided tomorrow...
after the interview.
For now we will pay.
Let's go daddy!
Khuda Hafiz. We'll meet tomorrow
Look now, myself
Big Boss...Haidari Kabab.
I will decide who pays here
and who doesn't.
We ate, we decide.
Sania... he is saying so lovingly,
so we should relent.
Love?! This is hooliganism!
Is your daughter so uptight
about everything?
Excuse me! I am not uptight!
Here's the money... including tip...
...we're going, the bill is settled.
But the heart is not settled madam.
Please take this money, or else...
Or else?
Or else, what?
Arm-wrestle with me...
winner pays the bill.
We're leaving... Come on.
Okay let's see what you got.
No Sania...
It was a joke madam.
You're a very serious number.
Was the curry too spicy?
- Mateena, get madam a cold drink.
- Right away!
Don't create a scene Sania...
We can't let him
insult us like this.
Swear on kabab...
no insulting madam...
Shut up and start.
Cheers for Taru bhai!
Cheers for Taru bhai!
Cheers for Taru bhai!
Cheers for Taru bhai!
Cheers for Taru bhai!
Cheers for Taru bhai!
Hey...you didn't even say ready,
steady, go...
Oh, you weren't ready Mr. Macho?
I am always ready.
- Sorry better luck next time.
- Come on now
Actually... for you,
there will be no next time.
Your interview... cancelled.
Your appoint... cancelled.
- Got it! Cancelled!
- Yes yes, it's cancelled...
But what have I done Madam?
Just a little welcoming.
In Lucknow,
we treat a guest like God.
Chauffe r.
Anyway I am not dying
for an appointment with you...
I am busy with appointments
from morning to night.
- And Taru bhai, all well?
- Here you go...
All well?
Tuck your shin in at least...
- It's a style papa...
- Save this style for home.
Mr. Tiwari...
- How are you?
- How are you sir?
All good
Which room is Sania
Habibullah staying in?
Jahapanah suite...
Oh! Suite!
Ateeq, Mateen...
- Yes, Taru Bhai
- Come on, pick up the artillery
Come!
Mr. Abbas and Family
Brothers!
Aren't we all brothers?
Hungry and thirsty...
how long have you been waiting?
And now it's lunch-time.
So on behalf of Haidari Kabab,
banish hunger...
...enjoy our kababs brothers!
Twenty lakhs!
Twenty lakhs?
Ok nineteen lakhs...
but not a penny less.
Colonel Abbas...
Major Abbas...
Madam...
Thank you very much!
So the marriage is fixed!
We have 300 grocery stores
in Dubai. 500 taxis.
5000 employees work under us.
Habibullah Group of Companies'
annual turnover is 200 crores...
...and you're insulting us
by asking for mere 20 lakhs!
How dare you?
- Please get out!
- C'mon son...
- How dare they ask for only 20 lakhs?
- C'mon...we've been insulted enough!
Are we mad that
we'll accept your proposal?
How dare you insult us?
Come on, get out.
Out. Get out from here
I said out
What are you doing...
you're over-acting.
What over-acting...
Father is a Colonel, son's a Major!
My heart was pounding with fear.
How did a Colonel get here?
I had made sure
no IPS or IAS officer...
...no police, no army man
comes in...
I had checked...
But you did well...very well.
What authority!
- Was it good?
- Yes...
Let's call the next one then?
Wait, let me just check
the camera...
I'm really enjoying
being a millionaire...
Until now, we used to be scared
of the boy's families...
...now they are wetting
their pants because of us.
Come, who's the next candidate?
Come on in...we'll make you
wet your pants...
Father-in-law uncle!
You can't barge in like this!
- May I come in?
- Meaning?
Myself Tariq Haidar...
You cannot come in. Your
appointment was cancelled.
Out.
I haven't come for
the appointment Madam.
So then?
For you, with my own hands.
Excuse me... We don't want
to talk to you about anything.
Have you forgotten
yesterday's defeat?
You gate crasher,
I'll send you to jail.
Uncle...
Hello reception...
Yes there is a man...here...
My great-great-grand-father
used to say...
...don't ever break
the customer's heart...
To mend hearts... here are kababs
made from his recipe.
I've come only to serve
these kababs...
There's biryani,
bread, curry, feerni...
...and papa-mummy as well outside.
Want to eat?
Want to meet?
- This one, give me this piece.
- This one.
It's very good...
Where's your fork?
Daddy pick up your fork...
- Shahi tukda
- Thank you!
<i>Hmmmmyummm...</i>
By Allah's grace we have
everything Mr. Habibullah.
But we have to consider
our traditions, customs...
...community, society...
Mr. Haidari... speak openly.
- Sania noting!
- Yes noting!
Noting!
Will you please put
the tiffin-box down...
...aunty's face is getting blocked.
- Anything else?
- No... thank you so much!
What can I say Mr. Habibullah,
I'm sure you understand.
Fridge double door...
...washing machine front loading,
AC split AC...
...such everyday items are a given.
Yes jewellery...
Two gold sets, two silver sets
and one diamond set will do...
And one car... that is
compulsory nowadays.
A Skoda will do.
Anything else?
- And...
- That's all.
Sania total?
Um... forty two lakhs.
Only forty two lakhs?
Round figure, make it forty.
Three lakhs,
forty thousand dirhams...
...you can convert it
and get whatever you want.
By today's conversion rate,
its approximately forty lakhs.
Approximately forty lakhs.
Now the girl's demands.
Of course, today girls are walking
chest to chest with boys.
Shoulder to shoulder papa.
Yes, I meant shoulder to shoulder...
Our country's Prime Minister
was a woman...
...even our President was a woman...
The wedding will be in two days.
Two days?
My heart is eighty percent
blocked... it can fail anytime.
I want to settle my daughter
at the earliest.
Invitation cards, fancy clothes,
relatives... all waste of money.
Waste is a sin...
It will be a simple wedding,
right here in this room...
...bride, groom, you and I.
The bride and groom will solemnize
the wedding themselves...
...according to Islam,
there's no need for a priest...
...only two witnesses are needed.
If you accept my conditions, then
it's a deal. If not, you can leave.
There are others waiting outside.
- But...
- We accept!
We accept all your conditions.
- Day after tomorrow, wedding.
- One minute.
Simple wedding... like!
<i>Okay'</i>
Bride and groom solemnize the
wedding themselvesmlike that too!
<i>Okay'</i>
But make her my wife...
without knowing her...not like!
Meaning?
I need three days...
with your daughter.
Are you crazy?
- What are you saying?
- Have you lost your mind?
One minute please.
We can all see Sania Habibullah
is very beautiful.
But beauty alone is not everything.
I too am a beauty!
She's uptight, she's feisty...
that's all I know about her.
She knows nothing about me either.
To become life-partners
we have to go beyond beauty.
Let's see if we can tolerate
each other for three days.
If we are to get along,
we will in three days...
If we do get along we will
get married, or else bye bye...
Do you agree?
Do not agree!
We're giving forty lakhs in dowry...
...that's all you need to know
about me.
If you want to marry me, you will
have to accept my conditions too.
No way.
As per our customs,
boys and girls...
...don't roam around
openly before marriage.
Then let's meet
behind closed doors...
- How dare you Tariq Haidar?
- Joke madam, joke!
In any case, day after is Holi.
On Holi everyone plays holi here,
nobody gets married.
Day after that is Saturday,
very busy day.
If the wedding can't
happen till Sunday...
...why not spend the
three days with me.
No... This spending time
business is not possible.
Not possible!
Ok, we'll take my cousin sister
Fareeda for safety... My safety...
No, thank you very much. Goodbye.
Ok goodbye!
Thank you very much.
Come on papa-mummy. Let's go.
Listen Tariq,
you're making a big mistake.
- We'll talk in the car.
- Why don't you explain to him...
He's always stubborn...
never listens to others...
Yes please leave...
...far better boys than
your son are lined up outside.
- Oh really? Khuda Hafiz!
- Khuda Hafiz!
Khuda Hafiz!
On the right...the yellow house
is of candidate number 12.
What tall claims he was making...
...that all of Lucknow
eats eggs from his poultry...
One who lives in this ruin will
never have the settlement money.
Cut his name...
That's why I wanted
to see for myself...
...the financial status
of the candidates...
...before choosing the prey.
How do we know who's lying,
can't trust anyone...
Wait, wait...
Tariq Haidar's house.
What an amazing mansion
It is...
They have 3 cars!
Yes! That red one is too sexy Booji.
- It's too amazing
- Yes, sorry
One thing is clear...
A court case will damage
their reputation the most.
They are wealthy too.
They will be able to immediately
pay the cash we demand. What say?
All that is fine...
...but I will have to roam
around Lucknow for three days...
...with that kababster Tariq!
And what if he says
no after three days?
We won't let him... I'll play
negative, you play positive.
Meaning?
Meaning... I will bad mouth
everything he does...
...but you praise him.
He will surely end up liking you.
Yes.
Her father was ready,
your parents were ready...
...even the dowry was enough
to keep our head held high.
What was the need to put
these stupid conditions Taru?
If she likes me even a little bit,
she will agree.
And if she doesn't?
You're getting old...
When will he marry?
I will marry the one who loves me
at least a little bit...
...if not a whole lot.
No chance of you finding
someone who will love you.
Wherever you go,
you put these conditions.
Or tell us where we can
find you a fairy queen...
...we'll go and get her...
So Taru, did she accept
your condition?
She will accept Mr. Chaudhary,
she will.
Did she call?
She will Nanhe miyan...
If she doesn't call,
what will you do Taru bhai?
Then where will you get
a moon-like bride for yourself?
I want not the moon,
Nor the night bird,
Nor a slice of sky.
I want not the light,
Nor a fairy
Nor a fairy-face.
She who walks with me,
She who tastes with me,
Each joy and each sweet sorrow.
I'll wake her from her dreams...
In my arms I'll make her sleep,
I'll pamper her,
I'll feed her all my life,
The heart has laid out a buffet,
The heart has laid out a buffet,
it's the feast of love.
If you accept the invitation,
please do come my love.
It's the feast of love.
The heart has laid out a buffet
I have laid out a carpet
of clouds for you...
I have decked out trays
of stars for you...
Why did you trouble
the moon and stars for me?
Wherever I go sunshine follows me
Your words are sugary sweet...
What about your feast?
Is it sweet as your words?
If you come, my bland party
will turn delicious.
If your party is bland,
why should I come?
If you tell me to...
I will fire all the dishes
with the warmth of my heart...
The heart has laid out a buffet,
The heart has laid out a buffet,
it is the feast of love.
If you accept the invitation,
please do come my love.
It is the feast of love.
Feast of love,
It's the feast of love.
Love mixed in the drinks
for the feast of love.
That's adulteration
in the feast of love.
Only the fortunate get
invited to the feast of love.
Who has the time to waste,
on the feast of love.
Don't dismiss, just taste.
Don't hyper-ventilate.
Let's get connected
Let's think about it
Not with thought, nor with tact,
I've invited you with my heart.
Ok then...l accept...
I accept your feast of love.
Yes Sir,
I agree to your feast of love.
It's the feast of love...
It's the feast of love...
It's the feast of love...
It's love, it's love,
the feast of love...
It's the feast of love...
It's love!
Come on Farru
Remember, you positive, me negative.
Slalekum! Hope you slept
peacefully last night.
No peace at all...
your hotels are rubbish...
Our Dubai has the best...
Oh daddy, their hotels are fine too.
Hello Fareeda. You've come
to take us sight-seeing?
I have no interest
in being a third wheel!
But Taru bhai promised me a new
phone if I agree to come along.
My phone is too old.
That's the only reason I'm here.
Fareeda and her tall-tales!
Come on Sania. Uncle, Khuda Hafiz.
Uncle will go as well.
Uncle will go as well?
If Fareeda has come with you...
...someone from our side will
have to go as her body guard.
Come on uncle, your daughter
doesn't need a body guard...
...she can bury ten bodies
with one hand.
Come on Sania, he doesn't agree.
No no... come, please come.
If only you had told me...
I would have brought along papa,
mummy, uncles and aunties as well.
You could have set the tuning
with the entire clan. Right?
He is so funny daddy
Let's go!
Let's go!
So Tariq Haider...
- ...we would like to...
- Taru... people call me Taru, sir.
We won't! It's a weird name-Tar...
It's not weird daddy, I like it.
She like it!
- How are you?
- Fine sir.
Where's the car?
Here it is, my Impala.
This red box!
We will go in this jalopy?
Entire Lucknow is crazy
about my Impala.
Entire Lucknow may be crazy
about your Impala...
...but Sania is used to luxury cars.
Get a Mercedes or a Benz,
only then will we go.
Or else, let's go back Sania.
Oh daddy, now that
Tariq is insisting...
I don't mind taking a round
or two in his Impala.
Uncle...
You should get comfortable
in the back seat.
Why?
Oh daddy...now that
Tariq is insisting...
I don't mind sitting
in front for an hour or so.
Rickety Impala!
Uh... Can I drive?
I'll drive?
Stop here...
What's here?
Hazrat Ganj
Saw it, let's go now?
If you're in Lucknow and don't go
'Gunjing' in Hazrat Ganj...
...you've done nothing
father-in-law Uncle.
Sania is allergic
to Gunjing etc, ok?
Daddy...now that Tariq is insisting...
I don't mind doing a round
or so of Gunjing.
The world's best 'Pani Batashe'.
Batashe?
Why, what is it called in Dubai?
'Gol Gappe'?
- Listen
- No.
We won't eat this...
Sania is allergic to chilies,
flies, pot-water...
Oh daddy...now that Tariq is insisting
I don't mind having one or two...
Let's watch a 'Picture'?
Or is she allergic
to 'Pictures' as well?
We don't watch 'Pictures',
we watch 'Movies'.
That too Hollywood.
Oh! Hollywood! I only like Bolly...
Once in awhile I watch Holly,
if it has action.
But every Friday, only Bolly.
Oh daddy...now that
Tariq is insisting...
I don't mind watching a... Bolly!
What a rubbish 'Picture',
even the heroine was so skinny.
But if you ever become roly-poly,
it'll make no difference to me.
What if I get paunch in the future?
Let me know now,
if you want a body-builder type.
That you won't get in Taru.
What's there in the body...
thin today, fat tomorrow.
Beauty should be in the thinking.
Beauty in thinking!
Ok Sania.
For our tuning-setting, there
should be no lies between us. Right?
Yes! No...
In that case... my bio-data posted
on the matrimonial site says...
...I'm a graduate.
- Yes!
- That's a lie.
Oh!
Yes!
Papa-mummy forced me to write that...
...saying now a days no girl is willing
to marry less than a graduate.
The truth is, I failed in the 12th
and you're an MBA. Right?
How will we have tuning-setting?
People from all over the world
come to taste your food.
So what if you didn't go to college
makes no difference.
But we will educate our kids
very well. Right?
Daddy! Can't see daddy anywhere.
Oh, yes.
Hadn't he come along
as your bodyguard?
Must be with Farru somewhere.
Must have been hard
for father-in-law uncle...
...after your mummy's death.
He had to be your mummy
and your daddy.
Waking you up, sending you to
school, must have done everything...
You haven't told me your mummy's
name. What was her name?
- Noorjahan Qadir.
- Noorjahan Qadir...
Qadir?
Her surname was Qadir.
Ok...
...she didn't change
to Habibullah after marriage?
Why? Boys don't change
their name after marriage...
...so why should girls
change their name?
They shouldn't!
Habibullah suit's you best.
Sania Habibullah.
I like it.
So tell me, how many kids?
Daddy will fall ill
if he runs around so much...
- Six, okay?
- Daddy
Twelve-thirteen okay?
Your luscious attitude
makes my intentions snap.
Your enchanting locks entangle
and unravel my promises.
If not the sea of love,
Give me but a drop,
Every bit of my heart, prays to you-
You're my prayer,
I ask you from you,
You're my prayer,
I believe you are my God,
You're my prayer...
You're my prayer...
<i>Hey Tarn'.!</i>
You toss your wild hair...
You toss your wild hair
and knock me out.
Your strike bolts with your
glowing eyes, and burn me down.
My youth is a thicket of clouds,
my being is fire
To be imprisoned in my mane,
is every young man's desire.
Yes I burn, but I'm drops
of cool intoxication too
Is it!
I fill a sea within
and let it rain love.
<i>You are Thumﬂ,
I'm Dacha...</i>
We are both exquisite raagas
Tune your notes with mine...
...and let the world sing.
Black, white, my every shade
Prays to you...
You're my prayer...
<i>- Oh Sanﬂu
- Oh Tam</i>
- Did you win the match?
- We lost the match
How many runs did you make Shakeel?
Full century
We lost, we lost, we lost the match
If you lose next time,
no jalebis for you
Thank you aunty!
Uncle, is this your aunty?
She's not aunty, she's uncle's wife.
Uncle's wife, uncle's wife!
My blazing heart is now used to you,
ls now duped by you...
Slowly my desire for you,
ls beginning to cross
my own boundaries.
The heart is not satisfied
with a drop anymore,
It wants your sea of love.
My patience,
is impatient for you.
It prays to you-
You're my prayer,
I ask you from you,
You're my prayer,
I believe you are my God,
You're my prayer...
Stop stop Taru, stop.
<i>Tarn? Huh?</i>
You know why I asked you
for three days?
So that in three days
you could start loving me...
...at least a little bit,
if not a lot...
...so that you marry me for love.
And if you hadn't
fallen in love with me...
I thought we could become friends.
Facebook-type.
But I do...from Tariq
I've come to Taru.
That's it!
That's all I wanted to confirm.
I am ready. You ready?
Yes ready.
Come on then!
You're my prayer,
I ask you from you,
You're my prayer,
I believe you are my God,
You're my prayer...
My room!
What is this?
All top heros and heroines
come to Haidari to eat our kababs...
...but my top most heroine is this...
What are you doing Tariq?
Call me Taru.
You said you have come
from Tariq to Taru.
But tell me what you're doing.
I don't want to marry you
for your cash value.
I want to marry you
for your own value.
The value of your friendship...
the value of your beauty...
...the value of your smile
...the value of your brains.
I don't want dowry from your daddy.
I'm not an item for my papa
to sell and your daddy to buy.
Papa doesn't understand.
His heart has attacked him once.
I'm afraid of fighting him...
...what if he passes away
without seeing his grand-children?
He loves me a lot.
But this disease of bowing
before society...
...and It's customs
doesn't leave him.
So, it's like this...
...he will not accept our marriage
without dowry...
So you tell your daddy...
...to give my papa-mummy
this forty lakh rupees as dowry.
Everyone wins!
What happened? Shocked?
Yes... Totally...
I didn't expected this at all...
You love me a lot right?
If I tell you something,
you won't be angry?
No
You'll forgive me at once?
Yes
I'm not Sania...I'm Gullu...
See...
I had come to trap you in a dowry
case and get money out of you
<i>Tarn...</i>
<i>Tarn...</i>
- Taru...
- Gullu...
Gullu save me...
Booji!
- Gullu!
- Booji!
Sania!
What happened? Shocked?
Very shocked...
I didn't expected this at all...
Sania... I never expected...
...that a scrap like me
would get a delicacy like you?
Has anything expected
happened between us so far?
But we're having a good time? Right?
So, get over the shock and smile.
But please don't tell papa-mummy
about this, it's our private secret.
Khuda Hafiz
Khuda Hafiz... Taar...ru.
We have to take care of
law and order as well...
Please get your wife the next time...
- Yes, please do..
- Yes, sure...
- Excuse me Ma'am.
- Yes?
Can I help you with the bag?
No.
- Sure?
- Yes.
He gave you forty lakhs,
just like that?
He has truly
fallen in love with you.
Will you still con him?
Listen to me...
If you tell him the truth even once...
...he will support you
in fulfilling your dreams.
- Don't be childish, Booji!
- How is this being childish?
Booji...he won't support me,
he'll send me tojail.
Fake currency, fake passport,
fake visa... It's very risky.
Now we're deep into this mess...
...there's only one way out...
stick to the plan.
Don't get confused...
...we will do what we have come for
and get out of here.
Aunty...come closer to Taru Bhai.
Yes, closer. That's it.
Ready? And...
- You're glowing aunty...
- Let me see...
Close the button at least.
It's alright papa.
- You should look like a groom.
- Our Taru is looking so handsome...
MY Smarty groom.
WOW!
Allah!
She's so pretty...
Let no evil eye cross
Sania and Taru's pair...
Three lakh forty five
thousand dirhams.
There's no need to count...even
if a hundred here and there is less...
...it's all in the family.
Yes.
I have booked the honeymoon
suite for the bride and groom.
Why? The bride will go home
with us after the wedding.
I'm leaving early tomorrow morning.
It will be easier for me
to say goodbye.
You can take her home tomorrow.
But this is not...
Why not...they can have
a comfortable breakfast...
...and come home by lunch-time.
What will you have for lunch dear?
Lunch? Tomorrow?
Anything would do.
Let's start the wedding.
You're more eager than us
father-in-law uncle.
- Let's start?
- Yes
Do you accept me, Sania Habibullah,
daughter of Shahriyar Habibullah?
I accept you,
accept your stubbornness...
...accept the way you
call my food yummy...
...accept the way you say Holly,
accept your fluent English.
Sania Habibullah,
as a whole and even in pans...
I accept you,
I accept you, I accept you!
That's enough for now.
Now it's your turn.
I accept your daddy,
your daddy's allergies...
Enough!
Yes...for now.
We have our entire lives
to keep accepting each other.
Miss Sania Habibullah,
daughter of Shahriyar Habibullah...
...do you accept me...
Tariq Haider, aka Taru Haider...
...son of Farooq Haider...
...the way you accept
my shahi tukda?
Do you accept me?
- I accept.
- Congratulations!
Come on.
I will have to go
to my beloved's home...
It's okay to cry my dear...
...you must be sad to leave
your father... go on, cry...
- Mummy, papa... Khuda Hafiz
- Khuda Hafiz brother
Now please be quiet aunty...
Why did father-in-law uncle
give dirahams in the suitcase?
He should have given my money.
Well...your papa-mummy
would get suspicious.
But daddy said thanks.
Look, what daddy got for us.
Get well soon... Who is ill?
Poor daddy, in all the wedding
excitement picked up the wrong one.
Father-in-law uncle is too much.
Have some kheer.
I'm not hungry at all Sania.
It's the tradition...
...if you don't eat this
everything will go wrong.
Please, from my hand...one spoon?
One for my beauty...
...one for my mind...
...one for my friendship.
Friendship!
(Sneeze) I'm allergic to roses.
(Sneeze)
Hope he is not dead?
You mixed sleeping pills
in the kheer, did you not?
I obviously wouldn't mix poison...
...you said four, so I mixed four.
Nothing will happen.
In the movie from which I got this
idea, they had put the whole bottle.
Sania
Let's leave before he wakes up.
Come on Gullu
Gullu!
Yeah!
Coming my love...
Tariq Haidar?
Yes
498a, you know what that is?
No.
Your wife has charged you
and your mummy-papa under 498a.
I have the proof... In this DVD...
...that you and your parents
demanded dowry.
Did you or did you not?
Speak up! You did, right?
Yes Taru...
so you are finally married?
Will you invite me to the reception...
...or I will get to meet your wife
at the birth of your child?
Really?
Fridge double door...
Washing machine front-loading...
AC split AC...
Everyday household
items are a given.
Yes, jewellery...
Two gold sets, two silver sets
and one diamond set will do...
And a car...
that is compulsory nowadays.
Skoda will be fine.
- Sania total?
- Forty two lakhs...
Only forty two lakhs?
Round figure, make it forty.
How much is your cut sir?
It's enough.
If we double that?
What do you mean...
...even we have some principles.
I'm the father of two daughters.
When they are of marriageable age...
...nobody will bother about
my uniform or my honesty.
It's because of you dowry-mongers
that we have to take a cut.
I am from the girl's side.
If you want an out
of court settlement...
...leave forty lakhs
at the designated spot...
...or else I'll arrest
all three of you in 498a.
Okay sir, okay...but where's the
guarantee that after the deal...
...this DVD won't reach
the commissioner.
What if they want more?
Did they guarantee they will not ask
for more dowry after the marriage?
Tell me... Did they?
When you didn't give us
any guarantee...
...why should we give you any...
lam from the girl's side,
don't you forget...
498a is a killer.
It takes down heavyweights.
If he files a FIR under 498a,
you will go straight to jail.
No bail.
Case will go straight to court,
and on the basis of this DVD...
...you will get a minimum
of six years in jail.
There's only one way out...
...give them the money
and get out of this mess.
I will not give any money
to give those cheating rogues.
Taru, don't be emotional,
be professional.
If all three of you go to jail, who
will make the biryani and kababs?
125 years old Haidari Kabab
will be ruined in one day.
Neeraj is right... The honour
of our ancestors...
You didn't think of the honour
when you were begging for dowry?
It was a mistake.
I swear on God I will never
even utter the word dowry again.
Just go and drop
the settlement money.
I won't spare that witch so easily.
O the black magic woman,
How she spun a web around me!
Tied me to her braid,
robbed me blind.
A birdie slayed a lion,
and flew away.
While the mustache
studs looked on in dismay.
Hail O brave-heart,
O black magic woman!
<i>Tam bhai...
Here, here... she's here</i>
Hail O strong one,
O black magic woman!
Give the bag...
...and return the dowry money
O the black magic woman,
How she spun a web around me!
O the black magic woman,
Gullu! Gullu...
Come here...here Gullu
Stop you cheat!
Go go go!
She broke the trust of my heart,
She stole the love of my heart,
and flew away.
Cheat!
Damn your affections,
O black magic woman!
Damn your deceitfulness,
O black magic woman!
O the black magic woman,
How she spun a web around me!
Who is it?
It's me Booji...open the door
- Why didn't you knock in code?
- Oh Sorry.
What do you mean sorry?
Is this something you can forget?
Yuck!
Have gotten used
to Taru's flavours...
...now everything else
will feel tasteless
Bolly...
Lucknow wasn't so bad,
we had fun
Yes, but now you forget
about bonding with Lucknow.
For Lucknow you are an enemy.
Think only of America.
Yes, America
Had a lot of fun?
You cheat!
Slalequm uncle
What did you find out?
Fake names, fake company,
fake passport...
...and only one hundred dirham...
...out of the three lakh
forty five thousand are real?
- Where is Taru?
- On the roof again...
<i>Tarn...</i>
What are you doing at that height?
Even if you chop all the
vegetables in the market...
...your anger won't go away.
It will go only when the father
and daughter will rot in jail.
But if you keep chopping carrots,
how will we find them?
Think Taru, think about her...
We may find a clue...
Her father had called her Gullu...
So?
How can a Sania's pet name be Gullu?
There has to be some story
behind the name Gullu.
Taru bhai!
I found your Gulrez Gullu Qadir...
Come fast...
What have you got?
Just breathe, I'm showing you...
Look at this...
She thinks she's too smart.
She became Sania but forgot
to close Gullu's facebook account.
Damn...
Where will I find this witch?
Hyderabad.
Is Mr. Abdul Qadir at home?
Babu uncle?
Gulrez Qadir?
Yes, come come.
Please sit.
I can't see your father?
He's gone for some important work.
What do you want?
Suppose I have one rupee
as black money.
How do I exchange it into white?
How, is our problem.
All you need to
understand is that...
...you will give me
one rupee in cash,
...and in exchange we will deposit
eighty paise in your bank...
...as white money.
That's it.
Why only eighty?
Twenty paise is our fees,
for turning black into white.
Okay...will it be transferred
by tomorrow?
Soon as you give the cash,
the transfer will be done.
No, first you transfer,
then I will give the cash.
No dear, this business
doesn't work like that.
Ok, then I don't want to do it.
Khuda Hafiz.
How much is it?
Eighty lakhs cash.
Hmmm... You called me uncle...
...your father is a respected
man in the neighbourhood.
Ok, your work will be done.
Had a lot of fun?
You cheat!
But within half an hour
of the money being transferred...
...my man will be here
to collect the cash
Think carefully, because once
the money is deposited in your bank...
...the white money is yours
and the cash is ours.
You will have to give
the entire amount.
I've thought about it...
...transfer it as soon as possible.
- Khuda Hafiz!
- Khuda Hafiz!
Taru bhai, there are
twenty six malls in Hyderabad...
...if we're lucky we will
find her in the first one.
My darned luck has
become a witch too!
Taru, I could only get tickets
for tomorrow morning.
I only have thirty bullets,
will that be enough?
- Have you gone mad?
- Why, won't be enough?
You're not taking a gun.
We will have to take the gun,
who knows how big is her gang?
Yes, but you can't take it
on a flight.
It's licensed.
Put it back.
O the black magic woman,
How she spun a web around me!
She's not a cup of tea,
Nor a cup of wine.
She's not a silver bell,
Nor an aching sore.
She's made of flowers,
But whips so hard.
She's so delicate,
But scrores over brawn.
The hard hitters just look on...
Hail the fire-cracker,
O black magic woman.
Hail the thunder maker,
O black magic woman!
Haizel Naidu,
Rajshekhar Raju,
Venkatesh Raja, G.S. Vijay,
Lakshmi Vijay.
In lots of ten only...
All of you go in please.
Rest of you, wait outside
for your turn.
Not just a bit,
I loved you a whole lot...
...and you cheated me instead...
You cheat!
Gullu... What happened? Let's go.
Abdul Qadir, Gulrez Qadir
Gullu, it's our turn...come on...
What's wrong? Come on...
Gullu!
- Excuse me... excuse me...
- Gullu!
What? You will return Taru's money?
You will go back to Lucknow?
Are you crazy?
I can't courier eighty lakhs.
I will have to go myself...to return
the money... To say sorry.
Are you possessed?
It's our turn...
let's go for the interview...
...take the visa...and go to America.
Booji, if it was any other
dowry mongering low-life...
I wouldn't care...
But I don't want to go to America
with Taru's money.
Just think...
...going back to Lucknow
is so dangerous.
Tariq Haider won't offer
you biryani and kabab.
He will take revenge,
he will send you to jail.
Let him send me
to jail if he wants to.
Let me be imprisoned for life.
Jail is not a joke...
They torture you...
...make you starve,
don't even give you water...
...you have to live like an animal...
I know...
...but I don't want to fulfill
my dreams by breaking Taru's heart.
Please understand. Please.
What are you made of?
You're not scared of anything.
I've spent my entire life
being scared.
I couldn't cheat because of fear...
...now I can't be honest
because of fear.
How did you turn out to be
so fearless, just like your mother.
From my fearless mother's womb.
Come on, sit now.
Sit, quickly.
Hyderabadi biryani is not bad...
It's poison...
<i>“everything here is poison.</i>
Hey Neeraj... that's Gulrez
Qadir's uniform, isn't it?
It's the same...come come...
Madam...
...one second madam...
excuse me...
- One second...
- Is he mad?
Madam...
Walk straight guys...
Why are you walking like cows!
Madam do you know Gulrez Qadir?
Yes, who are you?
Gullu Qadir has been selected
this month's Facebook beauty queen.
We have a gift voucher for her.
Really? I'll just call and tell her.
No, no Madam, if you call her
we will lose our jobs.
Then how will our wives and kids
celebrate Christmas.
You give us the number and address...
We will go and surprise her.
Will you have jalebis?
Please have some...
Ma'am, number?
If your mother was alive...
Booji... Save the sentimental talk.
I'm not being sentimental...
If your mother was alive...
...she would have given you
two slaps for being so stubborn.
You made me lie and run
all over the place...
...and then you didn't
even fulfill your dreams.
Crazy girl!
So what Booji.
It's ok if I didn't go to America,
I'll study Fashion Designing
right here.
There are no jobs in America anyway.
Everyone's coming here.
Booji, when I become
a famous Shoe Designer...
...they will call me themselves.
Not only America.
England, France, Russia
everyone will call my hero.
Not hero. Heroine.
Same thing...
...you never let me feel that
you were a daughter or son.
Come on, pack my pant shin too.
You're not going anywhere.
I'm going alone.
Enough of your stubbornness.
Won't work anymore. Come on, pack.
Hello...
Yes Babu uncle.
Stop stop...
What do you want? Who are you?
They had taken a water-filter
service appointment...
...now they've locked up and left.
Even the bank guys had come...
...they called them home too
and disappeared.
We had to give the cheque.
What happened Bilqees?
They called these poor fellows
for Aquaguard servicing...
...and have now disappeared.
If they're not around,
why don't you do my servicing.
Sure aunty, but at least tell us
where they have gone?
We have to write in our report.
Or we'll lose our jobs.
How will our wives and kids
celebrate Diwali?
They left with luggage...out of town!
Where airport?
Airport they can't afford.
They've gone to the station.
Let's go
Hey good for nothings...
at least do our servicing.
- I will complain to the company...
- Come on, station
Why are you making me
go round in circles?
- Am I a top?
- Come on, quickly
This is an auto not aeroplane.
- Booji, let's get the tickets
- Yes yes
Two tickets, Lucknow. Three tier.
All full.
Only AC 1st class is available.
Eight thousand,
one hundred and eighty.
Hurry up, the train will leave
in ten minutes.
Take it... It's not like
we have to save for your dowry.
We'll go in style.
First Class
Listen...you go that way...yes...
One packet of chips...
No, the big one.
Running away?
Babu Uncle!
Running away with my money?
No, didn't you get the cheque?
Cheque! Your neighbour-aunties
gave the cheque.
So why did you come this far, you
could have said thanks on the phone.
Is this a game? Is it?
Transfer now, withdraw now...
I was very clear, once the money
is transferred into your account...
I will take everything in cash.
Where's the cash?
- With my father...
- Call him then
No, he's gone to get the tickets
and then snacks...
...then magazine...then pillow...
why don't we go to him.
Yes.
Come on.
In case I miss the train...
...let me take the bag,
it has my favourite outfit.
Yes, yes... Come on.
Such a hassle for nothing...
Where is your father?
- Just there...
- Come on.
Hey babu, get some tea here
Hello...yes I'm in a meeting...
...let me get the money
from the party first...
...I will get the curtains then...
Crazy woman, cost me hundred rupees
The girl is getting away...
Catch her
Hey P.T. Usha...stop...
She hits bad...
<i>Sorry 50""'!</i>
Sania...
Sania...
Sania...
How slow are you guys...
...see how fast
Gulrez Qadir is running.
Catch her...
What happened brother,
why are you chasing that girl?
She's running away with my money...
Your's too?
You're too?
How much did she dupe you for?
Why should I tell you?
She's made a fool me...
she's made a fool of you,
...we are in the same team brother!
Sania...
Sania come down...
<i>Tarn'.!</i>
You've made a fool of me.
Get down now...
Scoundrel...
You're threatening with a gun...
You'll hit Babu bhai...
You'll insult him
in front of everyone...
- Catch him Rafiq...
- Who are you?
Catch him...break his head...
Hey, not with the can...
Hey wrestler...let go of my boys...
Hey...
Ungrateful girl, you're hitting me?
Sorry... sorry
<i>Tarn...</i>
<i>Tarn... Tarn...</i>
Enough of your drama...
...return my money...
Don't come forward you bully...
Just stop there...
Give my money...
- The police is here Babu bhai!
- Who invited these pests?
Please give my money,
please give it.
Uncle, I gave you the cheque.
You will get the entire amount.
- Come on, run!
- Will I make a curry of the cheque?
I will suffer a huge loss my girl...
Damn the money Babu bhai
let's get out of here...now!
Run...run...
Hey... My money... My money...
- Give me the bag...
- Here, take your money...
Leave me alone...and never
call me a cheat again!
Since the time I've come
you haven't shut up for a second...
Wherever I go, I hear
you calling me a cheat.
Yes I cheated you!
All my life I have faced
dowry seeking boys...
...who have insulted me and Booji
I'm a topper.
But there's no value of my mind.
They hear fifteen lakhs
dowry and reject me
You know how many times
I've been rejected?
I couldn't bear
the insult anymore...
...that's why I decided
never to marry.
I don't want any man in my life.
I made this plan
to fulfill my dreams.
But you ruined the entire plan.
What was the need...
...to make this relationship for the
value of my laughter, my beauty...
...my mind, my friendship?
Why are you so strange?
You never went to college,
you speak in broken English.
You eat paan, you burp,
you wear horrible shins...
...but yet I started liking you
for your sweetness.
I couldn't hurt you
and go to America.
That's why I was coming
to return your money.
It's eighty lakhs. You can count...
Hey Taru, here...
Hey!
Well done Taru, you caught the girl.
Look what I caught?
Leave him... Leave him...
Excuse me.
What do you mean
'see what I caught'?
He's my father, not a thief.
Taru, whatever happened,
it was my doing...
I made the whole plan,
it's not Booji's fault.
Please let him go.
What is this commotion?
Very shrewd criminals they are,
both father and daughter...
They duped my client
of eighty lakhs...
...it's in the bag...
Is this correct uncle?
Yes
Come on then, to the police station
<i>Just wait and watch now Tarn...</i>
I will get the maximum
sentence for her...
So that all the girls of India
will learn a lesson...
...that they shouldn't dare trick
innocent guys into 498a.
If girls trick guys,
they are low-life...
...but boys keep demanding dowry,
they are still considered innocent.
No.
You please leave... Sorry.
Made us run for nothing...
<i>Have you gone mad Tarn'?</i>
You come here...
What?
- If you want to say something...
- Will you shut up for a minute?
Can I say something?
I understood everything else...
...but what did you say in
the middle of that long speech...
...you started liking me?
What? Yes...
Just liking?
I fell in love with you...
Since I've returned from Lucknow,
I just can't forget the flavours
of your talk, of your food...
...of the fun I had with you...
I have gotten addicted
to your flavours.
So the butcher has fallen
in love with the goat?
You are that good...
Why can't all other men
be normal like you...
Then there wouldn't be any problem.
There would have been a big problem.
Then you wouldn't
have come to Lucknow.
Sania would have become
somebody else's in Hyderabad.
Gulrez
Oh yes, Gulrez.
So you have forgiven me?
What to do, you are that good.
You have tricked me
by feeding kheer...
...but I still want to love you
so very much.
Gullu... You hurt me badly.
- You won't again?
- No, no, never ever. Sorry.
What did I do to deserve you?
Something wonderful my dear...
that's why you got my Gullu.
Gullu-Taru, perfect couple.
Now we will have a real wedding.
Enough of fooling around,
shall we begin?
Gulrez dear...
Yes...
Tariq Haider, I mean Taru Haider,
son of Farooq Haider.
Do you accept me, Gulrez Qadir,
daughter of Abdul Qadir?
You accept without
a single penny of dowry?
Not once, a thousand times.
Say you accept son.
I accept...
Do you accept me Tariq Haider,
son of Farooq Haider?
I accept you.
Amju! The girl's father
is ready to help us.
Full help...
One crore.
Say thank you...
Father, I'm not an item for you
to sell and him to buy.
I don't want to go to America
with someone's help...
So sir, thanks but no thanks.
I'm sorry...
Amjad!
- Have you lost your mind?
- Yes, I have...
I wish I had lost it sooner.
Advertised love,
is for strangers.
Tested love,
is for brave-hearts.
Come let's wave the flag
of our crazy love.
Bright and bold and beautiful.
Let's colour love in our colours.
Bright and bold and beautiful.
Pull the curtains,
Lift the veils,
Banish the bashfulness of love.
Let's make the whole world speak,
Let's change the language of love.
Calculated love
is for the corrupt.
Committed love
is for the brave-hearts.
With fun, with fervour,
Come let's light
the fireworks of love.
Bright and bold and beautiful.
Let's colour love in our colours.
Bright and bold and beautiful.
Everyone eyes your figure,
But I'm crazy about your brains.
Every guy is wild for your looks,
But I'm sold on your thinking.
Body-beauty kind of love,
is for the phonies.
Tuning-setting kind of love
is for the exceptional.
Boldly, Loudly,
Come let's blow the bugle of love.
Bright and bold and beautiful.
Let's colour love in our colours.
Bright and bold and beautiful.",66007

This article needs an improved plot summary. (September 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message)

In the 1960s and late 1970s, when Mumbai's textile mills were shutting down one after the other, many unemployed youths, including Arun Gawli resort to matka-gambling on the insistence of his friends, Rama Naik and Babu Reshim, to earn some quick buck and form their own gang. However, soon, Gawli finds himself getting trapped in a vortex of crime when he is taken under the wings of Maqsood Bhai after committing a murder. Further, their clashes of ideologies and power games turn them against each other. Meanwhile, Gawli marries his sweetheart Zubeida Mujawar , who coaxes him to leave behind his murky profession. He almost makes up his mind to turn clean. But, when Rama gets killed in a brutal police encounter, Gawli takes in charge of their gang based in Dagdi. He suspects that Rama's killing was engineered by Maqsood and thus begins a gruesome gang war between them. Hot on the heels is a cop, Vijaykar Nitin, who wants to nab Gawli at any cost and take him to the task. The rest of the plot revolves around how one of India's most feared gangsters landed up in politics and his transition to becoming 'Daddy'.",1235,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt6926486.srt","Hey!
Get my phone.
They have provided self-help books
to the students taking the exam.
Sir.
The students are worried about
how the test will be.
We are worried about
what the questions will be.
Sandhya...
Get me some chilled water.
 We will try our level best... 
Has she gone deaf?
She can't even get me a glass of water!
Lazy woman!
- What?
- Sir, parcel.
- Sign here.
- Give me a pen.
I don't have a pen.
- You don't have a pen?
- No.
What's wrong with everyone?
 Victory to Arun Gawli! 
Victory to Arun Gawli!
Victory to Arun Gawli!
Former Mafia don Arun Gulab Gawli is
fondly called ""Daddy"" these days.
He is now a changed man.
He takes his political campaign seriously,
by focusing on helping the poor...
... with medicines, electricity,
and water.
Now we have drinking water, not
the many problems with water like before.
Now we have a garden to play in.
It has new swings
and it's fun to play there.
- Tell me more, dear.
- He built a gym in the school.
We also have uniforms, notebooks,
and lunch at school now.
Do we have to give him
police protection now?
They've turned him into a hero.
People used to be terrified
to enter the Dagdi Chawl...
...but today he is looked up to
and compared to Robin Hood. Suddenly...
Geeta, I don't know who Robin Hood is.
He is a thief, but not a villain.
He takes from the rich
and gives it to the poor.
That's good.
The residents here are
very happy with him...
...and they are praying
that he wins in the next elections.
Open all his old cases.
Do you remember Vijaykar?
He's been after him since 1986.
We have even held back his retirement.
He must be remembering
the numbers of old cases too.
There's one thing in life
that's very rare...
...an opportunity.
Your entire life can pass by
in search of that one chance.
I felt as if my life had passed by too.
But there it was again...
...an opportunity.
How many people were there?
Two, sir.
Two.
Did you see the shooter?
No, sir.
Why?
Someone shot MLA Mhatre.
This is a big case.
- Tambe...
- Yes, sir.
I think it's him.
It's him.
It's him.
Hello, ma'am!
I've got pedha for you.
You like pedha, don't you?
Have some sweets.
So, where's the leader of the nation?
What did he do now?
You want to know what he did.
What has he not done?
He started with extortion,
moved to gambling, robbery, smuggling...
...and then murder.
Your son will soon go in
for a long vacation!
He doesn't owe you anything.
So, why can't you leave him alone?
That's exactly what
I'm trying to figure out.
He's not even letting me retire in peace.
He thinks that he can become a Gandhi
merely by wearing a Gandhi cap.
He became what he had to.
I don't know whether it
was bad luck or bad influence.
But the worst thing
in his life was poverty.
There's no smoke without fire.
There's a strike.
No one will work today.
Stop working, everyone. Stop everything.
- I've got lunch for my father.
- Forget his lunch... Get lost.
No one will work.
He hasn't eaten since morning.
Hey boy! I'll have to knock
some sense into you.
Who are you calling 'boy'?
You cannot understand the plight
of a mill worker's son.
Go ask about the 200,000 workers
who lost their jobs.
Go and ask what happened
to their children.
- Babu, you're cheating again.
- Come on, play.
Put that coin back.
Will you play or not?
I won't play if you cheat.
- You play, Rama!
- Let it be.
Where are you going?
Sit.
Play with Rama.
Play.
Don't show me your teeth.
You should have seen the other guy's face.
Once again...
...you danced to their tunes.
You don't get it.
You must get them
to dance to your tunes.
Do you want ice cream?
Uma will get some for us.
Uma, come here.
Tell him about Parsiya's
famous ice cream parlor.
Why go there now?
Well, Parsiya opens
his gambling parlor at 9 a.m. ...
...and closes by 8 p.m.
When you enter, you'll see the manager.
I'll be sitting next to him.
- I'll sit there and...
- ""Here she comes, my friends...""
Rama, please don't do this...
""Her veil is a curtain. She pretends...""
Hey! Shut up!
Why the hell are singing?
Can't you see who's behind the veil?
Haven't you seen a girl before?
Why do you stare at me
that way every day?
- She's angry!
- What?! Come!
Come here! Talk to me.
I wasn't the one singing.
I like you!
Why don't you show such courage...
...in front of those union leaders?
After seeing her, I miss Hilda.
I need to visit the barber, and then
I'll meet Hilda. I have to go.
Aren't you getting married
to another girl?
My mother wouldn't like Hilda...
...and I can't break my mother's heart.
- Shall I call her out again?
- Get lost!
Hey. Don't you like me?
People say you're involved
in dishonest work.
What are you trying to say?
What do you do?
I'm in the import and export business.
Really? Import and export!
Why don't you import something
so that she can export?
Stupid fellow!
Shut up!
Hilda, stop his mouth.
Hold this.
The balcony is empty
if want some privacy.
Come, I'II bring you home.
""They didn't really want
to get into fights.""
""They just wanted to have a good time.""
""Oh, really?""
""Why were they constantly visiting
Parsiya's gambling parlor?""
Who knows what to do?
Do you see the open door?
We have to go in there.
- Is this the one?
- Yes.
Arun, you handle two of them.
Babu, you handle the other two.
Vijay, you...
What if there are more than two to handle?
How do you know
how many men are inside?
Vijay, go and get a count.
Why me? They will see my face...
Blackie, the whole
of India looks like you.
- No one will notice you. Go.
- Come on, go.
Be careful.
Run!
Damn it!
What are you doing?
Damn!
Arun!
Let's go!
He stole from a thief.
He didn't just steal... He murdered.
Shall I remind you?
Arun had nothing to do with it.
It was all done by that smuggler
Babu Resham.
Arun, what place is this?
You asked me where I work,
so today I'm showing it to you.
Hey, Babu.
Here.
He's a stupid fellow!
This is the key to Babu's vault.
What happened?
Nothing.
What's all this, Arun?
These are imported items.
VHS...
It must be expensive.
No one's asking you for money.
Take it.
Take whatever you like.
Arun, let's go.
Hold on...
I said you don't have to pay me.
Didn't I say it's for free?
- What is it?
- There's a big problem.
I'II be back, Mom.
What happened?
Parsiya killed Uma.
""They never imagined that Parsiya
would kill Rama's brother Uma.""
Let's go take revenge!
Have you lost your mind?
- Rama, let's go to the police.
- He was my brother.
Come on, Babu.
I told you he's a damn coward!
Come on!
- Come on, Babu!
- Hey, Rama. Rama.
- You're not coming?
- Let go.
- What do you mean, dog?
- Let go of me.
- Are you coming or not?
- No, I'm not.
What do you mean?
Are you going to go and salute the cops?
When you needed us,
we were there for you, Arun.
Don't ever show your face
around us, a**hole.
Rama!
What's wrong with you, man?
Let's go.
Hold it.
You motherf***er! Move back!
Kill him! Kill him!
Let's go... Let's go...
Hey... No!
Let go of me. Let go of me.
Who in God's name is it?
- What is it?
- Where is Arun?
- Where's Arun?
- What are you doing?
Get up! Get up!
- What have you done now?
- I didn't do anything!
Get up!
You didn't do anything?!
- Come to the police station!
- Leave him!
- Leave me!
- Come on, you filthy scum.
Let him go!
Get inside!
That's enough drama for one day.
Did you see how they
dragged him to the van?
He has lost all respect!
We belong to different communities
and so our lifestyles differ.
Zubeida, you won't say anything now.
Come with me to the village.
Do you recognize him?
Have you seen him before?
Have a look at him. Do you recognize him?
- Have you seen him?
- No.
Have you ever seen him?
Have you seen him?
Hey... I'm asking you.
Have you seen him?
Have you seen him?
Have you seen him?
Speak up.
Are you enjoying getting drenched?
Come on, get in.
Here. Have some Vadapav.
Take it.
Take it.
Finally, he is one of us now.
Forget it.
I have Lord Shiva's blessings with me.
Not even one person recognized me.
Isn't it a miracle?
Idiot, that was no miracle!
You have the don's support.
Got it? It's the don.
Don't ever forget his favor.
Don rules Dongri these days.
At his command, everybody
refused to recognize you.
Babu's connected with him.
He said he will meet on Friday.
Okay. You'll meet my henchman
after Friday's prayers...
- ...near Musafirkhana's poultry farm.
- Greetings, Rafique.
How are you, Babu?
Have a seat. Have a seat!
So... What was I saying?
Friday, after prayers.
And it mustn't be postponed
until Saturday, get it?
- Good bye.
- Watch out!
Sorry...sorry!
It's an old and unique piece.
In our line of business,
always keep your eyes open.
- I didn't see it.
- Have a seat.
You sit there.
- Behave yourself.
- It wasn't me.
Alright. Did the angels give you a tip?
Yes, place the bet.
Okay. Alright.
Do you know who he is?
Bump him off!
- This guy?
- Yes.
Samad Khan.
He is a Pathan.
He is ruthless.
I told the don
all about your act of bravado.
He has all the details of
the Parsiya murder case too.
Bet 2 million on Midget's Century.
When?
We'll tell you.
If you're caught, you're on your own.
We won't come to rescue you this time.
Have you ever used an English weapon?
- We'll use it.
- That's good.
You may come here to get
10000 rupees after you finish the job.
But we haven't discussed
the money yet.
We'll discuss it
once the job's done.
You're the first man who's ever...
10,000 rupees is more than enough.
It will be done.
We are taking on the Pathans...
...for the sake of friendship.
We'll talk once the job's done.
Have you lost it?
It seems the don is in a good mood.
He gives his word.
Get Samad killed,,,
Then we can talk about it.
Samad, won't you say goodbye?
Bye.
- Leave him!
- Kill him!
I didn't see anything.
Yes, I had an affair with Babu.
He even asked me to leave town with him.
I refused to go.
You see, I come from a good background!
I want to know the details of the murder.
Come...
Give me the names.
Listen... Come on... Talk.
You wanted a new beginning, didn't you?
Take some money
and make a new beginning.
That would be good for you.
After they killed Samad...
...the don kept his word.
In fact he even offered friendship.
- Greetings.
- Yes!
- The don sent it for you.
- Okay.
Goodbye.
I love the don's style.
'Samad Khan's Brutal Murder'
Check this out, Rama.
Babu... Rama...
Arun.
B.R.A. Gang.
What about me?
What about you?
You went there to kill him,
but you got battered yourself.
Does anyone have any objection?
Hurry up!
Come on!
Do it properly.
Come on.
Give Maqsood his money back.
I don't want to work under anybody.
So what do you want to do?
Become a businessman like Tata or Birla?
If I work here in this line,
I need to be an equal.
Look, Babu...
The dockyard area belongs to us.
We must get a share in it.
Think about it
The docks will belong to you
and we will rule over Agripada.
You speak to Rama.
I'll make him understand.
Who will talk to the don?
Don.
What does he put in
this custard ice cream?
He has never told this to anybody
outside his family.
He refused me twice.
Don, would you like some more?
That's enough.
How much can I eat?
Forget it, Arun.
The don said he'll think about it.
Maqsood has bought both
Poonam International and Caesar's Palace.
And we...
...we are doing his big jobs
for loose change.
It hurts me to give him such a big share.
If you want to be around for long,
learn to be patient.
The higher you fly, the harder the fall.
And hurt your ass!
It's time you settle down. Get married.
You aren't earning a penny,
yet you're getting married.
I'm done. So long.
- Wait! Where are you going?
- See you.
Idiot!
Who was Hilda?
My friend.
Hilda was crazy about Arun.
 But Arun loved Zubeida. 
So Hilda settled for Rama instead.
""I am with the one who I love.""
""I killed two birds with one stone.""
""The sparrow in my neighborhood
started dancing to my tunes.""
""She started dancing to my tunes.""
""I have a new parrot here
and he is amazed by her.""
""I have a new parrot here
and he is amazed by her.""
Rama married the woman
his mother chose...
 but celebrated his wedding night
with Hilda. 
Why are you shouting?
Rama, let's go.
""She started dancing to my tunes.""
Hey... What are you doing here?
- Rama...?
- No, no. Go down.
He's decorating the place for you.
Go back down... I'll call you.
They were like wild horses.
They had made a gang
but they weren't capable of managing it.
And one day Babu showed us
what a beast he was.
Babu, open the door.
Nothing will happen to you.
What can even happen?
Dammit!
Quiet!
Are you going to open the door
or must I call the police?
What is it?
Open the door now!
What's the matter?
Have you lost your mind?
Don't go inside.
- What? Call the police?
- Have you lost your mind?
You're drunk.
Don't make a scene!
- Stop! What are you doing?
- Don't touch me!
You're call the police?
You'll call the police?!
- Let go of me!
- My name is Babu!
- You think you can have me arrested?
- Let go of her!
Babu, let go of her!
It hurts.
It's chilled.
He can't hold his drink.
So...?
You called the cops!
You did the right thing.
What he didn't learn outside,
maybe he'll learn it in jail.
What was that?
Who is it?
Who is it?
They sent you to get me out of here?
Couldn't you have told me, you bastard?
You shot me! Damn you!
Anyone could've killed him.
I'll deal with you once I'm out of jail.
But he was killed
by his childhood friend.
Damn you!
And so Babu became history.
They went to the police station
with bombs and weapons...
...in order to kill him.
Who did that, Don?
You could blame a woman's curse for that.
A leaf falls in this city
and you know about it.
They don't want money, they want a share.
They need to know who did this.
Just think...
What person didn't turn up at his funeral?
Did Vijay do this?
Where is he?
Who did it? Where can we find him?
- Tell them one last time, Rafique.
- Yes.
If you want to be my equal,
learn to find information for yourself.
- Out of the way.
- Do you understand?
You don't earn a reputation
just by wearing high heels.
""The weather is romantic
and we should grab the opportunity.""
Whether you like it or not...
...one day everyone ends up
working for the don.
You know that, sir, don't you?
But Gawli...
He was a whole different breed.
Dear audience,
we're taking you to the moon today.
Here's our rocket.
And from this rocket, a beautiful girl...
...will land on the moon with her lover...
...and dance to celebrate her love.
""Hey, darling, I want to dance with you.""
Dance...
Dance of Love.
Dance on the moon.
""My life is full of dance...dance.""
""Devotion is my dance...dance.""
""My happiness lies in dance...dance.""
""I lose my senses when I dance...dance.""
""My body is for dance...dance.""
""My love is only for dance...dance.""
""My beloved is dance...dance.""
""My love is for dance...dance.""
And now, I'll take you to another world.
- Venus.
- Venus?
""Eight... Seven...""
""Six... Five...""
""Four... Three...""
""Two... One...""
""Venus! We are Venus...""
""Venus! We are Venus...""
""Touch my body with your breath.""
""Seal my lips with yours.""
""When you peer into my eyes""
""I forget every other thing in the world.""
""My life is full of dance...dance.""
""My devotion is dance...dance.""
""My body is for dance...dance.""
""My love is only for dance...dance.""
Darling, let's go to another world.
- Mars.
- Let's go.
He does that every day.
Here... Take this.
Tell Pappu that he is getting too greedy.
- Okay.
- I'll knock some sense into him.
- Get going now.
- Okay.
Goodbye, boss.
Hey, Vijay.
Where were you last Monday?
You black dog!
You guys consider yourself
gangsters, don't you?
Babu had become too arrogant.
But he started crying like a baby
 when I shot him...
...the bloody pig!
If he were alive,
I would kill him the same way.
- F***ing bastard!
- Hit me... Hit me!
F***ing junkie.
Shoot him.
So you're going to shoot me, you coward?
I've seen you.
Damn you!
Rama, let's go!
Ask your men to leave. Do it!
Move back, or else I will kill him!
Move back!
Arun, let's go!
Who sent you?
Hey! Who sent you here?
Hey! Did Maqsood send you?
- Arun, let him go.
- You bastard!
Arun, let him go! Run!
It still hurts, doesn't it?
So why didn't you arrest
Arun for Vijay's murder?
Why did you declare that he
died in the police encounter?
I knew...
...that you wanted a promotion.
I didn't say a word either.
You can trust me.
They knew it wasn't going to be
easy to fight Maqsood without any support.
Only one man could
get them out of this mess.
Ashok Joshi.
It's so peaceful out here.
Hey, Gauri!
Did you inject the medicine into
Kaushalya? She has a fever.
Yes, I did.
So...why have you come here?
- Mr. Joshi, why don't you...
- Rama!
I've already told you...
...that I'm not coming back.
I'm not getting into that mess again.
I have weapons and I have shooters too.
They both are my trustworthy henchmen.
Sada.
He prefers local guns
to the automatic ones...
...because they never jam.
Newman.
He used to work for Maqsood.
Maqsood would give him all the big hits.
He knew all his secrets...
...so they chopped off his tongue.
You need to oil the weapons...
...not just look after the buffaloes.
Everyone forgets the past...
...and with each passing day,
Gawli is erasing all the evidence.
But I remember everything, sir...
...like yesterday.
I know the rest of the story.
Now do one thing...
Testify against Arun.
You will be safe.
I will see to it.
But... You will have
to stay with us for a while.
Police protection.
Have a look at this, sir.
Documents never lie.
Sir, there's a call for you.
Hello.
Sit.
If Arun learns of this meeting...
...he will never speak to me again.
And you know what will happen to you.
Stop this nonsense.
You dared to call me here...
...because an arrest warrant
for him will be issued next week.
You really hate him, don't you?
You two are old enemies.
The truth is, he is just like you.
Had he been born in your family,
he would have been a cop.
And if you had been born in Dagdi,
you would be a gangster.
How are you?
What are you doing here?
Making some tea. Would you like some?
Dad arranged a marriage for me.
The wedding was to take place yesterday...
...but I ran away.
What are you saying?
Why?
- What do you think the reason could be?
- What?
For you.
Will you marry me?
So, that's done.
No one in your family came.
I don't see anyone either.
Then, who's the witness to our marriage?
Huh?
There was a long line
for the sweets and garlands.
- I had to wait forever.
- There he is.
- He?
- Here you are.
I don't trust this man one bit.
Hey! You won't find another man like me.
I am the guest of honor today. Get it?
- Come on.
- Listen, your stay has been arranged.
What? Aren't we going to your house?
That will take some time.
Mom won't understand.
- Here, have some sweets.
- I had sweets last night.
- Come on...
- Have some. Don't be stubborn.
- Have some
- Let me feed you.
Here, this is for you.
Open it.
What is it?
Look after your own things
and life will be blissful.
Whose house is it?
It belongs to a friend.
- Enjoy. Be a man.
- Stop it!
Where's the owner of the house?
He won't return anytime soon.
He's behind bars... Careful!
You're scared of a rat!
Rama!
Greetings.
Arun, have a look at this.
- Who sent this?
- That...
Have you told anyone about our wedding?
No.
'Congratulations on your wedding
Don'
What's the matter?
Arun left Maqsood's company,
but Maqsood didn't leave Arun.
We never felt as if we were alone.
And Arun had picked up a bad habit.
Have you gone mad? Huh?
He killed Babu, tried to kill us,
and you want to negotiate with him!
You go be his slave if you want to.
Just don't drag me into it.
What? What did you say?
Don't talk nonsense.
What will you do without him?
Rama, we'll do what we are doing.
What are we doing? We're doing nothing!
Don't you want to be successful like him?
That's your problem. You ignore
whatever you don't want to hear.
I don't want to hear anything.
Just do as you're told.
I'II pick you up tomorrow.
Arun, tomorrow is Eid.
Don't go anywhere tomorrow.
Okay?
It's our first Eid together.
I have called family members here.
I know.
God is great.
Arun!
Arun?
That year on Eid, I realized
even gangsters have some cardinal rules.
One: On the festival, everybody meets
like friends to try to settle differences.
Two: Nobody touches family.
""On the day of Eid...""
""...even enemies greet each other.""
""No matter how severe the enmity is...""
""...everyone forgets their differences
on the day of Eid.""
""We wish you a happy Eid.
It's time to celebrate.""
""We wish you a happy Eid.
We wish everyone a happy Eid.""
Hi, Arun.
Happy Eid.
- Happy Eid.
- Happy Eid.
Give my regards to Zubeida.
""We wish you a happy Eid.
It's time to celebrate.""
""We wish you a happy Eid.
We wish everyone a happy Eid.""
Now listen to me carefully...
There's nothing left
in extortion anymore.
All we get is loose change.
But we can earn a lot
with cocaine.
As you wish, Don.
You see, we're going to
open a college in Mira Road...
...for the Nigerians.
That will make it easier for us
to supply drugs. Hm?
The goods are mine
and I will see how to get it supplied.
You guys open up the docks
in your area.
You'll get a 25% share.
Parekh, did you
see the building plan?
Everything is on track, Don.
The work is going ahead full speed.
So tell me, Rama.
""Eid is the most
blissful day of the year.""
Look, friendship does matter...
...but there must be only one leader.
""We wish you a happy Eid.
It's time to celebrate.""
Done!
""This is the day to celebrate.
This is the night to celebrate.""
""Everyone is meeting their friends.""
My hands are dirty.
""We wish you a happy Eid.
We wish everyone a happy Eid.""
""We wish you a happy Eid.
It's time to celebrate.""
""We wish you a happy Eid.
We wish everyone a happy Eid.""
""We wish you a happy Eid.
It's time to celebrate.""
""We wish you a happy Eid.
We wish everyone a happy Eid.""
""We wish you a happy Eid.
It's time to celebrate.""
""We wish you a happy Eid.
We wish everyone a happy Eid.""
It's not about selling drugs.
There is nothing wrong or right
about one's work.
Maqsood...
I don't trust him one bit.
Arun, this line of work cannot be trusted.
I want a father for this child.
I want a home.
That's all I am asking for.
I will talk to Rama tomorrow.
I will tell him
I want to get out of this.
Is Rama home?
He's out getting a haircut.
- How are you?
- Mama...
Arun was certain
he didn't want to do this anymore.
He was sick of this.
And he knew where to find Rama
if he wasn't getting a haircut done.
Is Rama here? I want to talk to him.
He isn't here.
Come in.
Pray that Arun doesn't
end up the same way.
He was going to quit.
If you hadn't killed Rama that day...
...Arun wouldn't have become ""Daddy"".
Arun tried hard to get out of all this...
...but there was a storm approaching.
First it was Babu.
Then Rama.
Who's next?
It's you, Arun.
Which is the other one?
- It's there.
- Use them both.
- Gawli's popularity is increasing.
- Yes.
Elections are coming up,
but we don't have even one confession.
Witnesses are already terrified of Gawli.
None of the shooters are willing to speak.
Everyone says he's going to win this time.
What about him?
Hey...
Leave me... I said, leave me!
Hey! Don't touch me.
Why are you taking me there?
- Come on... You'll see...
- What?
-What are the charges against me?
-Come on!
- Under what charges have you arrested me?
- Come... I'll tell you everything.
The problem of
sexual harassment hasn't been solved.
So that isn't solved yet!
- Didn't we tell Joshi to handle this?
- Yes, Daddy.
- Tell him to fix this.
 - Okay.
Brother, Vijaykar has arrested Pamphlet.
Listen... Get our lawyer there.
Sir, that's Pamphlet Bandya.
I arrested him at the brothel.
We found all these things in his bag.
What is this?
That's my hobby.
It's just like gambling.
Is collecting this your hobby too?
I have the same hobby.
Bra... B.R.A.
Babu Rama Arun.
Look...
if there's anything you
know about these three, tell us now.
What's written in it?
What are these codes?
We should know, shouldn't we?
Do you remember now?
- If you recall anything, then tell me.
- Speak!
Speak!
No, sir.
Arun would kill me.
Gawli is not what he seems.
Arun?
It's been a long time...
I suddenly thought of you.
Yes.
- Would you like anything?
- Water, please.
Right away.
Now you drink during the day, too.
What can I do?
There's not a single day...
...when I don't miss Rama.
You remind me of him.
Don't you miss me?
I know it.
I have seen the way you look at me.
You are lonely... Hm?
I remind you of Rama!
Why did you do it?
You tipped the police about Rama.
 Gawli knew that Hilda
tipped the police about Rama. 
 He could have killed her, but he didn't. 
This incident gained him respect
among everyone.
Hello.
Okay.
Brother, it's for you.
Yeah...
Arun.
What makes you call me today?
Avenge yourself on the policeman.
And if you stay quiet now,
people will forget about
your gang's existence.
I have an idea.
Call that cop to Dagdi.
Pump bullets into his chest
and have his body dragged out.
Rama was your friend after all.
Rama still dwells in my heart.
But everyone knows
that he was hanging out with you lately.
I have an idea.
Why don't you call that
cop to your area and do the same?
I'm more interested in
the guy who sent the cop to kill Rama.
This was a direct challenge.
And, he decided...
...to go back to Dagdi.
He knew that if he had to fight a war...
...he would need a fort.
- Pass it over.
- One Mouser.
One Mouser, one Magnum...
...two double barrels.
And that's just what he did.
I need this done...
- Pamphlet, have you seen Arun?
- No.
He must be at home.
- I...
- What's going on?
We're renovating.
Fix that quickly.
Arun doesn't trust anyone.
If he knows I'm here,
he won't spare me.
If he kills you,
we won't spare you either.
Sir, we found all this at his place.
I used to be his bookkeeper.
No. 21. Take it.
22... Get going.
This is boring, Brother.
When do I get to be part of the action?
You keep the accounts.
You, come here.
- What's your name?
- Prashant.
- Where are you from?
- Dharavi.
- Where are you from?
- Dharavi.
- Dagdi... Dagdi...
- What did I tell you?
It was a mistake... I made a mistake.
Go... Go from here.
Which area are you from?
Where are you from?
 Sada, what are
people saying about me? 
Brother, since we don't
get out of Dagdi...
...people wonder if our gang is scared.
We need to paralyze Maqsood.
Only then will they
take our gang seriously.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
- Are the boys ready?
- Yes.
Pamphlet?
They are ready.
That's his family album.
Open it.
This is Manish Duggal, his film financer.
Kill him.
You've been blessed with a girl.
That's good.
Boys cause a lot of trouble.
Lord Shiva has been kind. Hm?
Yes, He has.
Her nose is not like yours.
Can I?
Come to me, baby.
Look at her, Sada. Eh?
Look at those eyes...
They've got power in them. She's got guts.
Don't you? Don't you?
Come on, play your card.
- Hey, give the gun to him.
- Who is it?
Hey! Drop the gun!
Hey!
Move! Move!
You've been cleaned up real good.
Go on.
Do you know why I slapped you?
Because there's no point in killing you.
Either the police will kill you
or Maqsood will.
Now go and tell him...
...that we're coming for him.
Greetings, Don. Sautya's here.
Remember, I told you about him.
Yes, I've heard that name.
He's a real loose cannon.
He'll do anything for you,
and he's even ready to go to jail.
Hey! Sit on the chair.
I'm talking to you.
Sit on the chair.
No, sir. I'm good down here.
What's the job?
This is for you.
- Who is he?
- Get going.
Boss, I guess this is for you.
""Congratulations Arun.""
- What is it?
- Sweets.
Open it.
Isn't he your friend?
Yes, he is. But he's a real man.
That's Ashok Joshi's ring.
What are you saying?
What is that?
Get out! Out! Get out of my house now!
Arun, tell them to get out!
Get out! Are you deaf?
What's all this?
Who gave this to you?
They came to Dagdi for this?
Who's in charge of security?
What kind of father are you?
What about your daughter Geeta?
Will we live in fear our entire life?
Look after the child. You're scaring her.
Although Arun had taken over after Rama...
...he was a family man.
How was he to manage
the gang's affairs?
All of us were shitting bricks...
...because he had locked horns
with Maqsood.
Brother, Chinese marvel.
Don't be fooled by the size.
It's fully automatic, and...
- Brother, why don't you rest up?
- Come to me, baby.
Don't cry, baby.
We'll deal with him.
And it's not right for you to go there.
You shouldn't expose yourself.
We're here... We'll handle it.
- Do you have a shot, Sada?
- No.
Shoot him when you do.
- How are you?
- All good.
Go inside. I'll handle them.
Go inside, boss!
Boss, you go inside!
It's not the right time!
With that daring attempt
to kill Maqsood...
...the entire underworld
took notice of Arun.
Sir, a man wants to see you.
He says it's urgent.
- Where is he?
- He's sitting outside.
What's going on here?
Get out...now!
What does he want?
Nothing, I just want to talk.
I heard you're carrying out
a full investigation.
- I know Daddy better than anyone else.
- What do you mean?
I mean you can ask me anything
you want to know about Daddy.
I will tell you.
- I'm writing a book on Daddy.
- Okay.
I want to know what Daddy did
after attacking Maqsood.
I want to know that.
That's what people say.
But do you know what the truth is?
At that time, Daddy was with
all of us at Ratnagiri...
...for a picnic.

Go home.
Arun.
Arun!
Hail, Lord Shambhu Narayan!
Hail, Lord Shambhu Narayan!
Maqsood killed Gawli's brother.
He broke the rules of the game.
He didn't consider the festival
or family.
But you knew which side
your bread was buttered on, right?
Everyone knows who tipped him off.
You did.
Is that because Maqsood is a cop's son?
Does that make him your family member?
Since we're digging up the past,
here's something else.
We have details about the
flight he caught to get out of India.
We also have the details of
who made his passport.
You remember everything, don't you?
Am I right?
It will take a couple of months.
Maybe we'll have a solution 
in the next 6-7 months.
What are you trying to say?
Do you mean the don will have to stay
out of the country for seven months?
You're deciding where we will stay!
Mumbai doesn't belong to anyone except us!
Hm? What do you mean?
Are you giving me a tip
or is this free advice?
Not advice, sir.
The government's policies are changing.
Such cases are going
to be charged under the TADA...
...and it doesn't qualify for bail.
And then even I will be helpless.
I see... Now you're thinking 
about government's policies.
Didn't this occur to you
when we filled your pockets?
""TADA will be implemented.
There will be this and that...""
That's bullshit!
You helped Maqsood escape...
...and you used TADA
as an excuse to enter Dagdi.
- Gaitonde, check the meter room.
- Check upstairs!
Hey! Don't move!
""...awaken our spiritual consciousness.""
Arun...
""Om...""
Wait a minute, Inspector.
Praise Lord Shiva!
You took the credit for nabbing Arun...
...but the truth is
that Arun wanted to get arrested.
And that's because he knew
he was safest inside.
What is it?
It's for Gawli.
Brother...
Brother...
Brother...
Lunch for you.
Keep it here.
I don't want any complaints.
How are you?
Geeta.
She's grown up.
When are you coming home?
That will take some time.
What are you hiding from me, Arun?
Maqsood has sent his men in here.
They want to kill me.
Let's go... Time's up
Get me out of here.
It wasn't just a bad time in the city...
...but in the jail as well.
They separated Hindu prisoners
from Muslim prisoners...
...so that they wouldn't riot.
But Arun knew that
he had to keep Dagdi safe.
Remove this.
No rioting in Dagdi and Chinchpokli.
Our feud is not with any
religion or community!
Stay united.
Dagdi will protect the
Muslims, understand?
Pull it down.
Don't worry...
Stress affects your hair.
Times had changed,
but Daddy was still the same.
He always thought of his people.
Shake hands with me.
Hey...
Shake hands with me!
Brother...it's done.
These are the papers
to bail you out. Just sign here.
I won't sign this.
Why?
I don't want to come out now.
It's a trap.
They're waiting for me outside.
This is what they want.
If I come out, they'll kill me.
They can kill you in here as well.
Get me transferred from here.
Get me out of this place.
Make some arrangements for that.
 For 10 years, Arun moved
from one jail to another. 
 She would get the transfer done. 
She would follow his car each time...
...to make sure there were
no traps on the way.
Greetings.
Open up.
Come.
- Everything okay?
- Yes, sir.
Two people are here to see you.
- Uncle...
- Sachin.
- How are you?
- Great.
- Have some vadapav.
- See what the Chief Minister said!
What is this?
It says,
""Our answer to Maqsood is Gawli"".
I've got vadapav for you.
It's in the Marathi newspaper, too.
""With our children, Arun Gawli
and the backing of the minister...""
The entire country has gone to dogs.
Now only you can run the country.
- Isn't it true, boys?
- Yes, you're right.
- Yes, he can...
- He can!
Brother, why don't
you run for Prime Minister?
Brother Arun!
Brother Arun! Greetings to you!
Brother Arun!
10 years is a long time
to spend within four walls.
I went to jail because, unlike others,
I am not a traitor.
I won't flee from my own country.
I was afraid...
...that my people wouldn't
recognize me when I come out.
But your love has made that fear flee,
just like my enemies.
I'll always be indebted to you...
to all of you...
for the love and respect
you gave me and my family.
From now on,
it will be my responsibility...
...to take care of your problems.
Hey...
You're such a grown up girl, Geeta,
aren't you?
- What's this?
- It's for you.
It's in English, so you read it for me.
""Welcome home, Daddy.""
I see...
Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy!
And that's exactly how he got his name.
'Daddy.'
Now that you know everything...
...just tell me one thing.
Where is Pamphlet?
We're here for him.
You see, we want to apply for his bail.
- Yes, we even have the documents.
- Yes, we do.
He isn't here.
Do you have a weak memory?
Actually, old age is a cruel disease.
By the time you're close to retiring...
...you can't shoot straight,
your hands start trembling...
...and you end up appointing a nurse.
Damn you...
I will show you where you belong
once you get out of your house!
I will show you where you belong!
You're just an ordinary gangster.
I've dealt with cops like you before.
I had to lie for you.
I'll deal with him once he comes out.
Your friends are here to bail you out.
No, I won't go out.
Then sit there. Come!
Let him go!
It seems everything was
going well for Daddy.
...so what's his connection
with this guy?
My boss really respects you.
He said that I must get you
into our party at any cost.
Sachin told me...
...that you want police protection.
Right?
That will be taken care of.
Just run from our party.
But Daddy...
...this time you'll run from Chembur
and not Chinchpokli.
I hope you're okay with that.
Who are you?
Daddy, he's in the
Legislative Assembly, Mr. Mhatre.
I came to meet your boss.
Call him. We'll talk.
My boss isn't well.
He can't meet you today, understand?
We came all the way from Dagdi
to meet with you people.
When your boss feels better...
...tell him to come to Dagdi.
We'll talk there.
- This isn't done.
- Daddy...
That's how it works.
My boss will talk to you
when he feels better. He'll meet you.
Sachin, come here.
I want to show you something.
Sada, isn't that where
Khatau Mill was?
Remember how he came crying to us...
...asking us to have the place vacated?
Who gave the orders?
Your boss.
I see that now he has a big house there,
doesn't he?
- Daddy, please...
- I get it.
- These people still think I'm a gangster.
- No...
Yes, that's why they can make me a
candidate but they can't be seen with me.
Daddy, please...
You're mistaken.
At least listen to him once.
It will make our lives better.
Please, I worked really hard for this.
I too worked hard for them,
but what did I get?
They are not like us.
Daddy?
Praise Lord Shiva.
It's only a few more days.
Arun's going to win this election, sir.
I'll be dead for sure.
Start praying.
Pray to God that he doesn't win.
Here...
Yes, Sada.
There's a problem.
Pamphlet has turned hostile.
- Before the election...
- Listen, you won't do anything.
We are white-collars now.
Focus on winning the election.
Once we win, everything will
fall into place. Understood?
You said all the cases and charges
against me were dismissed.
What is this now?
Daddy, all the old cases are settled.
I swear.
If they've filed a new case,
I know nothing about it.
Come fast! Quickly!
- Move back!
-Hey... You coward!
Stop hiding behind women!
I guess I'll have to send a
lady constable to bring you out.
Move back!
What is it? What are you doing here?
I've come to take you back to jail.
Do you have a warrant?
I have pages of evidence
and confessions against you.
Right... Go make paper planes out of them.
Take your pansies and get out of here.
Who the hell did you call a pansy?
Don't ever enter Dagdi without a warrant.
By the way, I heard you are retiring.
Perhaps I could give you
a job as my bodyguard.
- Hey...!
- Beat it!
You want to kill me!
Look at him, he's here to kill me.
That's our police for you...
Encounter specialist.
""Come on, shoot me. Encounter specialist.""
Did he discuss this
with any of his seniors? Hm?
""Encounter specialist. Come on, shoot me.""
- ""Beat it!""
- ""Come on, shoot me!""
Sir, I didn't inform anyone...
...or receive anyone's permission.
He outplayed you again.
Just watch how Gawli gets
sympathy out of this.
I messed up, sir.
I should've shot him.
Don't talk shit, Vijaykar.
Don't act smart!
Do you want him to win the election?
There you go.
The Home Secretary is calling.
Talk to him.
Yes, sir.
The number of the bullet
and the name of the shooter...
You see, sir, Pamphlet has
used a different code each time.
And he keeps forgetting
what the codes mean.
I am not sure that this is
admissible in court.
I think we need to find another way.
If we follow the procedures,
we'll get nowhere.
Then what will we do, sir?
Pappu Borivali,
you recognize us, don't you?
You killed your girlfriend.
That's really bad.
You're definitely going to
rot behind bars for 15-20 years.
Do you see my senior there?
He can get you out in two years.
But no one's going to do it for free.
This is a map. Can you memorize it?
Hail Arun Gawli!
Hail Arun Gawli!
Good luck, Daddy.
Come.
Hail Arun Gawli!
Hail Arun Gawli!
Sada, you know what you
have to do, don't you?
Yes.
They've set up roadblocks ahead.
No one will do anything.
""Wait for my instructions.""
""I can see them.""
Hold on...
Send both men from the left side.
Damn...
""Polling Booth""
You better come back to me.
You go, Brother. I'll handle them.
Let's go.
Hello.
Idiot of a constable,
you're not answering my calls.
Do you know what this victory means?
""Hail, Arun Gawli!""
""Arun Gawli makes history
by winning the election.""
""The entire area is
celebrating his victory!""
""And Arun is thanking the people.""
""It feels like a miracle...""
""...that Arun Gulab Gawli is
now a member of Parliament!""
- ""Keep striving Arun Gawli.""
- ""We're with you all the way!""
Our dreams have finally come true, Arun.
We won.
What kind of victory is this?
Everyone's left us.
No... Don't say that.
""He has a long way to go...""
The people are with you, Arun.
""He won with the most number of votes...""
""...and it feels like it's just
the beginning of his political career.""
On behalf of Mumbai Police...
we ask...
...that Arun Gulab Gawli, aka Daddy...
...not be given police protection.
In order to eradicate
the Mumbai Underworld...
...15 inspectors and 60 cops
have sacrificed their lives.
The Mumbai Police has filed
120 cases against Arun Gawli.
Murder, attempt to murder,
extortions, conspiracy...
If Arun Gawli is given
police protection...
...then it will be an insult
to all the martyred officers.
That's correct!
Silence... Silence, please.
Honorable Speaker...
...in the past, a lot happened
between the police and me.
I paid a very big price for my past...
...by spending more than
half my life in jail.
If the people can forgive me, then
why is it so difficult for all of you?
The people have not forgotten.
You still have the image of a gangster.
The image can be changed
if you let me work.
And for that, I have to
go among the people.
Because of my past, I have enemies.
If the police won't protect me...I'll have
to arrange for security and carry weapons.
And then people will call me
a gangster once again.
Hey, Gawli!
You said you'll carry weapons!
And you want us to
believe you have changed!
If I haven't, it's because
you won't let me. That cop...
...arrests my men without any charges.
He waits outside my home
to kill me in an encounter.
I have changed
but none of you accept that.
Ladies and gentlemen, we won't
tolerate the humiliation of democracy.
This joke on democracy...
...won't be tolerated!
It won't be tolerated!
Your Honor,
Arun's motive was clear.
The reason behind killing MLA Mhatre...
...was Arun Gawli's public humiliation.
They were enemies.
We have both records and
witnesses to support it.
And through our investigation,
we learned...
...that the orders to kill Mhatre
came directly from Arun.
In defense against these charges...
...do you have anything to say?
I am innocent.
Do you know this woman?
My friend knew her.
Confess everything, Arun.
You will feel unburdened.
You're getting another
opportunity, just like me.
I strongly object, Your Honor.
We have enough evidence
to prove Rani's character.
The Police had already
set their sights on Arun.
But it seems they are trying to prove...
...that this hooker's network
is stronger than that of the police.
Point taken.
Your Honor, this man here
kept all the records...
...Gawli's guns, pistols
and other ammunition.
Do you know him, or is it
your friend who knew him?
I know him.
This is a country-made pistol...
...that was used to kill MLA Mhatre.
Does this gun belong to Gawli?
Yes. This is Gawli's gun.
Is this your gun?
I am a gangster, Your Honor.
I use automatic weapons.
Why would I use a country-made pistol?
For 40 years, Gawli has been accused of
many crimes but acquitted at every trial.
This is the biggest case
of the millennium.
They changed the judge again.
According to our sources,
Gawli gave 3000000 rupees...
...to kill Mhatre.
Yes, I gave him the contract.
I don't know this man.
Do you know why you've
been called to the court?
Yes.
Did he fire at Mhatre?
- Yes, sir.
- Are you sure?
Yes, it was him.
- Have you met Arun Gawli?
- Yes, I have.
I strongly object, Your Honor.
Objection overruled.
Have you worked for him?
Yes, I have.
Tell me where he is.
That's him, sitting there.
Do you have anything
to say in your defense?
Five judges changed
and we already have a judgment.
I've never seen any
case wrapped up so quickly.
The police and I never got along,
so they brought fake witnesses.
They claim I accepted the
contract to kill Mhatre.
Why would I kill Mhatre?
I gave my two seats to his party so
they could form a majority.
I served punishment for the
mistakes that I have made.
But now I want to do something good.
I have faith in your system
and that you...
...will make the right decision.
 Yes, I will... 
Arun Gawli, I should give you death.
But I give you life.
Let's go...
- Sir, one photo...
- Please!
Move back... Move back...
Daddy, I've been following
your story from the beginning.
There have been many ups and downs.
One last question.
What next?
What do I say?
They shut down the mills...
The value of man dropped while the
value of land increased.
Who built skyscrapers on the land...
...that we helped them vacate?
Who lives there now?
 Leaders, businessmen... 
From those heights
they look down upon me and say...
That's the gangster.",44586
"44","tt2976176","Lakshmi",2014,"Plot

Lakshmi, a 14-year-old girl, is kidnapped from her village by Chinna (Nagesh Kukunoor) and brought to Hyderabad. She is taken to the home of Chinna's elder brother and boss, Reddy, where she first naively assumes the role of a domestic worker, helping the much older existing maid Amma. However, she is later raped by Reddy. The next day, Chinna takes Lakshmi to a brothel managed by Jyothi, who is both a reassuring and oppressive figure to the girls. After her first night, Lakshmi manages to run away to a nearby police station, but her complaint falls on deaf ears since Reddy has paid off the local police force. Thrown in this horrific, inhuman world, she survives with the help of the other girls and her own will to never give in. She forms a close friendship with her roommate at the brothel Suvarna, who walks her through the realities of life.

It is revealed that Jyothi works for Reddy in order to fund her daughter's college education and plans to retire as soon as she graduates. At the brothel, Lakshmi meets Uma, a kindhearted woman who periodically brings the girls sanitary items, condoms and sweets. While servicing a client at his home, Lakshmi tries to escape but is caught and punished by Chinna. She develops an infection due to the injury and is nursed by Jyothi and Survana, but is ultimately forced to work again, when a client demands a young girl. The client turns out to be an undercover agent Mohan who operates with the help of Jyothi and Uma, and Reddy and Chinna are arrested. The girls are taken to a women's shelter, where Lakshmi recovers, but the case against Reddy stagnates since no one is willing to testify against him. The brothel is reopened and one by one, the women slowly return, until Lakshmi is the only one left at the shelter.

Against all odds, Lakshmi shows courage where everybody else fails. Her lawyer is in retirement due to having previously suffered a nervous breakdown, and initially refuses to take the case. He believes that Lakshmi will not be able to withstand the immense stress of the case, since she is the only witness against a powerful trafficking syndicate. Resisting all pressure - violent threats, coercion and bribes, she stands up in court. Her testimony reveals that her father sold her to a local politician, who in turn sold her to Reddy. At the brothel, Chinna beats and tortures Jyothi as punishment for her betrayal, and also reveals to Jyothi's daughter that she works there. Later that night, Jyothi castrates Chinna and slits her own wrists, resulting in them both bleeding to death. The trial results in a landmark judgement in India, succeeding in putting the traffickers behind bars.",2676,NA,NA,NA

The film is divided into five chapters.

The Seven Sisters (North-east India)

The first chapter opens up with an ambush in June 2015 on the convoy of the Indian Army troops in Chandel, Manipur by NSCN(K) militants. In retaliation, Major Vihaan Singh Shergill, a Para SF officer and his unit, including his brother-in-law, Major Karan Kashyap, infiltrate and attack the Northeastern militants and also kill the key leader responsible for the ambush. After a successful strike, the Prime Minister of India congratulates him and the whole unit at a formal dinner. Vihaan requests an early retirement as he wants to be close with his mother, who is suffering from Stage VI Alzheimer's, on which the Prime Minister offers him a desk job at New Delhi near his mother instead of retirement, to which he agrees.

An Unsettling Peace (New Delhi, India)

The second chapter shows Vihaan taking a desk job at the Integrated Defence Staff HQ in New Delhi and him spending time with his family. This segment also briefly describes the Pathankot attack. A nurse named Jasmine D'Almeida is assigned to take care of Vihaan's mother. Vihaan meets an Indian Air Force pilot named Flight Lieutenant Seerat Kaur, who is trying to prove her patriotism to her martyred husband, who was an army officer who died in an ambush. One day, Vihaan's mother goes missing. He searches for her, and blames Jasmine for her ignorance, stating that there is no need for her security. Vihaan's mother is found under a bridge, and Jasmine reveals herself as an intelligence agent. The film reveals why the families of the special forces soldiers were given security due to the threat from the North-eastern terrorists.

Bleed India with a Thousand Cuts (Uri, Jammu Kashmir, India)

On 18 September 2016, four heavily armed militants attack the brigade headquarters at Uri, Jammu and Kashmir at dawn, killing 19 soldiers in their sleep. The terrorists are killed, but Karan dies in a grenade explosion due to accidentally pulling the pin attached to the terrorist's rifle, which he picked up to examine. The whole family becomes devastated, including Vihaan. The Ministry decides to take strict action against the perpetrators of the attack. National Security Advisor Govind Bharadwaj suggests the idea of a surgical strike. The Prime Minister gives it a go and gives ten days for the strike. Vihaan leaves his desk job and leaves for Northern Command base in Udhampur. He requests Chief of the Army Staff General Arjun Singh Rajawat to count him in the operation to which he agrees. Vihaan chooses the elite Ghatak Force commandos from the Bihar Regiment, and the Dogra Regiment along with the special forces as most of the soldiers killed in the attack were from these regiments. Vihaan informs them that they can no longer use their phones and disguises the mission as regular training exercises. The commandos begin their training.

Naya Hindustan (New India) (New Delhi, India)

During the planning, Govind ropes in ISRO (for providing satellite images), DRDO (for drone surveillance), and RAW (for intelligence). When he goes to meet the DRDO Chief Brian D'Souza, he chances to meet an intern named Ishaan who has developed a drone called Garuda which looks and is shaped like an Eagle. With the help of the drones and satellite images they can get the exact location of the hideouts and training camps of the terrorists. Jasmine reveals her true name as Pallavi Sharma to Vihaan, and during an interrogation, the two extract information about who planned the attack. He chooses Seerat to be his pilot, who agrees wholeheartedly. Govind also suggests intensifying the artillery shelling at the border for distraction and painting their assault helicopters with Pakistani Air Force markings. The commandos also start training under Vihaan. The Pakistani officials suspect the Indian activities but dismiss them due to underestimation.

The Surgical Strike (POK, Pakistan)

On the night of 28 September, the commandos leave for the strike in Pakistan occupied Kashmir in Mi-17 helicopters. During the mission, Vihaan's helicopter is forced not to cross the Line of Control due to the latest intelligence from spies in Pakistan that the Pakistani Army has deployed an ""AWAC"" early warning radar-based surface to air missile system in Muzaffarabad sector to bring their helicopter down. He and his team improvise by going on foot through a cave (which was very risky due to darkness and the unknown presence of other terrorists). His team successfully infiltrate and kill all the terrorists on the two launchpads. Similarly, other commando teams also manage to kill all of the terrorists. Vihaan kills Idris and Jabbar, who are the perpetrators of the Uri attack. The local police are alerted, and the commandos who are low on ammunition and time escape. On their way back, they are heavily rained down upon by gunfire from both a nearby machine gun bunker and a Pakistani Air Force Mi-17 Helicopter, which was scrambled to intercept Vihaan's team. Flight Lieutenant Seerat comes to their rescue by firing back at the Pakistani gunship, thus driving it away and eliminating the machine gun bunker. His team successfully crosses the LoC on the Indian side with no casualties. The rest of the assigned teams are also successful and are back with no casualties. Vihaan lands at Hindon Air Force Station at Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. The film ends with him, Pallavi, Govind, and the commandos happily having a formal dinner with the Prime Minister.

In a post-credits scene, Zameer, a Pakistani minister, wakes up and shouts in frustration while seeing the news of India's successful surgical strike. The scene cuts to a title card reading ""Jai Hind"".",5930,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt8291224.srt","'The producer, the director, the artist,

Let's go... Let's go.
Sartaj.
Sir.
Kailang.
Kailang accompanied by Ebohal.
Along with 70-80 terrorists of KYKL...
Double of what we had expected.
Sir, shall we radio-in the B-team?
Negative.
They won't get here before dawn.
We'll lose the element of surprise.
We might not get
this opportunity again...
when all the terrorists of Nagaland
and Manipur have assembled in one place.
Karan.
Form an outer perimeter
with 10 commandos.
Mainly snipers.
Sartaj, the other commandos and I, will
move in from the left and right flank...
for a direct assault.
You will handle any terrorist
who gets out of our circle.
No terrorist gets out alive.
Copy.
- Copy.
Copy.
- Good. Best of luck.
Best of luck.
Sartaj.
Anyone spot Kailang?
Negative Sir.
Commandos!
- Yes, sir!
How is the spirit?
- High, sir!
I said how is the spirit?
- High, sir!
Jai Hind!
- Jai Hind!
Jai Hind!
- Jai Hind!
What is Major Vihaan's background?
He's an NDA Topper.
Para-Commando Gold Medallist.
His father; Col. Meher Singh Shergill.
Was martyred in the Kargil war,
in Tololing.
Posthumous, he was
honoured with the Mahavir Chakra.
After being trained
for the Special Forces...
Vihaan was posted in Kashmir,
Jaisalmer, and Manipur.
He was also responsible for the on-ground
planning of the North-Eastern mission.
Boys!
Major Vihaan Shergill.
- Fantastic.
He headed this operation, sir.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
Donor to meet you too, sir.
Major Karan.
- Very proud of you, officer.
Thank you, sir.
- Well done.
Capt. Sartaj.
- Sartaj.
Thank you, sir.
Your team's bravery and skill...
has put a stop on the movements
of the North Eastern Terrorism.
We're very proud of you.
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
We just received a word from RAW...
that the remaining terrorist groups
want to compromise with us.
After the Special Forces mission,
they have no choice
but to compromise with us.
Vihaan.
General. Arjun mentioned that
you've put in a request for...
pre-mature retirement
on compassionate grounds.
Why? What's wrong?
Sir...
my mother has Alzheimer's.
Stage 6.
Her memory is fading by the day.
And, she hasn't been
keeping well either.
I've been posted
in the Eastern Command,
and she lives here
in Delhi with my sister.
I would like to spend some time
with her before she forgets me too.
Bravo.
You're a good son who wants
to take care of his mother.
But it's also important to
take care of your country.
After all, this country
is also our mother.
Isn't there a
way other than retirement?
There is.
What if we transfer you
to the Army Headquarters in Delhi?
You'll stay close to your mother,
and us too.
What say?
Right, sir.
Great.
Mr. Govind.
- Sir.
Arrange a nurse for his mother
who will stay with her 24 hours.
Sure.
Well...
Why don't you all
start with dinner..
Everyone must be hungry.
Doesn't matter how many times you
read that report,
nothing will change.
I have just one request.
When I get very sick,
don't dump me in some hospital.
Mom, no one's taking
you to any hospital.
I feel very afraid when I am alone.
Take your pills.
Here you go.
Take it.
- Neha's promised me...
Mom...
I am trying my best.
I swear.
- I know.
I know you're trying your best.
Mom, take your pills.
May I?
Hi, uncle.
What took you so long to open the door?
- Sorry.
These are all of mom's clothes.
The only thing left
now are the books.
I will bring them over later. Okay.
Oh yes, her medicine.
Did you give her the medicines?
- Just did.
Where is she?
- Inside.
Okay.
Uncle?
At what age did
you get a black belt?
16.
See this?
It's a Green belt.
I'll get my black belt
in a couple of years.
Then you better
be careful around me.
And don't make me lose my temper.
So what are your plans after
getting the black belt, Ms. Karate?
Firstly,
I'll join the army like uncle.
And then become India's
First Female Army General.
Bravo.
Uncle's sycophant!
Because your father's a clown,
isn't he?
You don't think he's
an officer, do you?
Suhana, go get the scissors.
Scissors.
Vihaan, please go help Karan.
- Why?
He's made a real mess
planning your party.
Oh, God.
Our home looks like a
couple of grenades went off.
Seriously.
Scissors.
- Thank you.
Let's go meet your papa.
- Come on.
Mom's nurse will be arriving soon.
The guest room is ready for her...
Vihaan.
- Yes, mom.
When did you arrive?
He just arrived today, mom.
He wanted to surprise you.
How long are you planning to stay?
10 days.
He's planning to take
you to aunt Rajni's house.
In Dehradun.
You better leave.
Karan's waiting for you, okay.
Mom, did you watch
your favourite show?
Suhana, go finish your homework.
Did you eat?
I am really famished. Let's eat.
Uncle. Let's go.
Uncle, Papa taught me
your battalion's war cry.
Really? Tell me.
Courage and competence in war,
sacrifice is the ultimate Dharma.
Come on... You call that a war cry?
When you shout out a war cry...
it should make the
soldier's blood boil.
And your enemies should
shiver in their boots.
That's a war cry.
And start eating
eggs for breakfast.
No more salads like your mom!
Get changed,
And then we can do your homework.
Go.
- Okay.
Sartaj?
Didn't you have a date today?
Why didn't you go?
You didn't hear?
What happened?
He got all dressed up,
wore Armani perfume...
and was about to leave when he suddenly
gets a message from his girlfriend.
Saying ""I am tired of
this relationship, its over.""
I am really sorry, I didn't know.
I am not finished yet.
A little later she
messaged him again.
Saying ""Sorry sweetheart, this
message got sent to you by mistake.""
These uptown girls I tell you...
uptown...
But anyway...
How are you going to
manage staff work in Delhi?
A man like you will go
crazy pushing pen in South Block.
Your planning has never failed
in any of the missions.
Sir, you're needed at the border,
not in Delhi.
Look, every soldier
has to this job as well.
And, you both know
that I have to do this.
Now stop making these sad faces
and pass me the cottage cheese.
Did mom's reports come in?
- They did.
It's spreading aggressively now.
Hope you are having a good time.
Please help yourself, guys.
- Karan.
Here's your drink.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
This is nothing, Capt. Zeeshan.
Vihaan's dad in fact brewed
the best brandy in the world.
And often after returning from school
we would help ourselves to it..
Soon he found
out and suspected us.
So, in order to save
ourselves from the beating...
we transferred half of the
brandy to our school water bottle.
And, we passed urine in the half empty
brandy bottle to make it look full.
Not us, just him.
And unfortunately, the very same night,
his Titu uncle flew in from abroad.
To try the latest batch of brandy.
He took one sip and, Listen. Listen.
He took one sip and said...
""Exquisite!""
Hello, sir.
When did she fall asleep?
- A little while ago.
Did she take her pills?
- Yes, sir.
She has a habit of waking
up in the middle of the night.
If you need anything,
feel free to tell me.
I'll be right here.
- Yes, sir.
Don't worry, sir. It's my job.
And, in case you want to rest,
there's the guest room.
No problem, sir. I am fine.
Thank you.
What is your name?
- Jasmine.
Jasmine?
- Jasmine Almeida.
Jasmine Almeida. Sit.
Sit.
Stop spreading these
lies immediately!
You've turned this into a joke.
Everyone knows that
we're a peace-loving nation.
You blame us for every
trivial attack in your country.
I want evidence!
Evidence!?
What more proof do you need, sir?
What you're saying is baseless.
Absolutely baseless.
Three terrorists infiltrated
our border through the Ravi river.
They opened fire on
a Punjab Roadways bus.
Some were injured...
But the driver kept his head
straight and didn't stop the bus...
and drove straight
to the Government Hospital.
Where are the terrorists now?
Right now they are hiding in
an under-construction building...
near Dina Nagar Police Station.
But the Swat Team have
already started their operation.
Keep NSG on standby.
- Okay, sir.
Which terrorist group
do they belong to?
According to our sources,
these men are from Lashkar.
Do we know how many
people have died?
Four civilians are dead.
And 11 are still serious.
Sir. IEDs were discovered
at the Pathankot Railway tracks.
There's a probability
of finding more.
Sir...
Please excuse me.
Sir.
The Punjab Swat Team
has arrived on the spot.
IEDs were recovered from railway
tracks between Pathankot and Amritsar.
Sorry, sir.
We're doing our best.
Yes, sir.

It's been more than 16 hours now
and yet there seems
no respite from this encounter.
The ADI building is being targeted
by rocket launchers and grenades.
And Fire has broken out
in one part of the building.
We've learned from our sources that
two soldiers have been injured...
although we have
no confirmed information.
And the sound of the explosions...
Jai Hind, sir.
Why are you here?
Sir, my case is
under investigation.
My first posting was
in Srinagar in July 2014.
I was just getting
to know my work when...
there was a huge deluge
in the first week of September...
and the dam on Jhelum broke.
Water started to
rise at an alarming rate...
in the low lying
areas of Srinagar.
All the MI-17 and Dhruv
pilots immediately...
engaged in a sortie mission.
Without any rest or food, we started
rescuing people from low lying areas.
On the 7th night at 3 am, we
received a distress call from Rajbagh.
A 7-year-old child
was badly injured...
and stuck on the roof
of her house along with her mother.
There was almost no visibility
due to the rain.
As a result, the Commander cancelled
all rescue missions till dawn.
But somehow I couldn't
get that child out of my head.
I had to do something.
Sabiya and Zooni.
Is anyone from your family
in the Defence forces?
Dad? Mom? Brother?
No, sir.
My husband was.
Capt. Jaskirat Singh Rangi.
Seasoned Punjab Regiment.
He died in an ambush
at the Naushera Sector.
Jaskirat was a big patriot.
The only thing I
am afraid of now is...
whether I'll ever get to prove
my patriotism to Jaskirat or not...
Mom.
Mom.
Mom.
Mom.
Jasmine.
Yes. Yes.
How's your acidity now?
Are you taking your pills on time?
Okay, I am going to call you back.
Where's mom?
- Inside. Sleeping.
Stay here.
Peaceful-Peacefuller.
More peaceful.
Most Peaceful...
- Neha, did mom come here?
No.
Oh, God.
- Mom.
I am extremely sorry.
I am sorry.
It was very urgent.
I wouldn't have if
it wasn't an emergency,
You know me.
I would have never taken that call.
I am extremely...
- I know...
What is your real name?
Jasmine Almeida...
- What is your real name, Jasmine?
Sir, I just told you.
Where's my mom?
- Vihaan...
Relax.
- One second, Neha. One second.
I don't...
- Now you listen to me.
Neither my family, nor
I need protection of any kind.
I am quite capable of
protecting them &amp; myself!
And I definitely don't need an
incompetent and fake nurse like you.
So tell your Intelligence
Department...
to find my mom
by hook or by crook,
and bring her home.
Do it!
Can I take it?
- Yes, you can.
Hello.
Where?
Okay.
Our agents found Mrs. Suhasini
under the Dwarka bridge.
The day I came here I put
GPS tags on all her clothes...
so that we can track
her every movement.
She should be home soon.
I might be an incompetent nurse,
But I am a damn good agent, sir.
I am sorry.
She should be home soon.
Jai Hind, sir.
Jai Hind.
- There's still time for breakfast.
Can we get tea?
Shaqeel.
Shaqeel.
Shaqeel.
Let's go there.
That side. Run.
Go on. Go.
They are heavily armed.
Around 4-5 terrorists.
Sir.
- What position?
Two are behind the West Wing.
Major Awasthi's team
has opened counter-fire.
One of them is
on the Admin block...
and the other near the T6 wall.
Sartaj.
- Sir.
Fetch me my Draganov
from the Transit room.
I'll blow their bloody
brains out from right here.
Hurry.
Rohit. Thapa.
Yes sir.
- Sir.
Cover me.
Sartaj, Go through the West Wing
and reach at the fuel depot.
And you two rendezvous
near the T6 bunker.
Sir.
- Best of luck, guys.
Go. Go. Go.
- Yes, sir.
Stop! Stop!
Stop firing!
- Stop firing!
Courage and competence in war.
Sacrifice is the ultimate Dharma.
Sacrifice is the ultimate Dharma.
This is no time to think
about the UN or USA's opinion.
It's time we send a message to Pakistan
in the language they understand.
If we don't give a fitting
reply for this cowardly attack...
then it will shatter the morale
of our army and our civilians.
People will lose
faith in our government.
Sir, we can prepare
for war in three days.
I can send our tanks and heavy
artillery under 8 hours to the LC.
I think we should
dishonour the Indus Treaty.
If ISI gets pressurized
by Pakistani citizens
then maybe they will
lessen their terrorist attacks.
Pakistan is under the ISI.
The ISI is not under Pakistan.
They might let their
people starve to death...
But never stop funding terrorism.
We must think of a better option.
Govind.
Govind.
A surgical strike, sir.
Surgical strike.
Infiltrate POK and annihilate
their terrorist launchpads...
their hidden terrorists,
their handlers, and guides.
And looking at Pakistan's
nature they will never admit...
that terrorists
are breeding on their land.
So, if there are no terrorists, then
there's no question of a strike, right?
And, since there's no strike, there's no
point of war or international pressure.
Most important...
this is our biggest opportunity
to strike back for Uri.
Doesn't a surgical strike
sound a bit dangerous?
We can use our jet fighters to bomb
some of their bunkers near the LC.
During the Munich Olympics, PLO
terrorists killed Israeli athletes.
But Israel didn't strike back by
just firing a couple of missiles.
They engaged Operation
'Wrath of God'.
They hunted down every single terrorist,
dragged them from their home
and killed them.
In the history of India, we have
never attacked any country first.
And Pakistan has been taking advantage
of our nature from the beginning.
1947, '65, '71... '99...
In fact, sir. Our tolerance
is being mistaken as our weakness.
This is our chance to
instil fear in their hearts.
Make them believe that India
will not take things lying down.
This is a New India.
We will infiltrate them
and hit them where it hurts.
Ravinder...
We have no enmity with
the Pakistani population.
Our war is against terrorism.
I think Govind is right.
Arjun.
I think it's a good idea, sir.
Fine...
In 10 days we'll carry out the most
lethal surgical strike in Pakistan.
Ravinder, you prepare
a team along with Arjun.
And you will lead this mission.
You will do all the planning.
And you will update
me about their progress every day.
Everyone else keeps the
Pakistani authorities busy.
Give them evidence
of the Uri attack.
Ask them for an explanation.
But at no cost should
anyone get a whiff of our plan.
Remember...
these meetings
shouldn't be logged.
Did you eat?
No, sir. Don't feel like it.
Wait, I'll get something.
- No, sir.
I am in a hurry.
I... have received my orders.
They are planning
an operation in Kashmir.
I don't know the details, but...
I guess...
they are planning
to strike back to avenge Uri.
Karan sir always said...
not a single man can die
when Vihaan's around.
He'll even fight
with Death to save us.
I really wish you were
there to lead us, sir.
I found two dirty shirts
amongst Karan's stuff.
And I don't know what to do.
I don't want to wash them
or hand them over to someone else.
I can still feel his
essence in them, Vihaan.
Sir, you once mentioned
in your lecture...
there exists a thin line between
responsible and irresponsible.
I don't want to be on
the other side of that line.
If I don't fight for my men,
my country now...
then I'll be irresponsible
in my own opinion.
And I won't be able
to live with that.
I promise you, sir, you can send me
to any corner of this world to fight.
I will bring all my soldiers
back safe and sound.
Sir, let me be a part
of this mission in Kashmir.
I request you, sir. Please.
Vihaan,
in 8 days you're going to
conduct a surgical strike in POK.
Tomorrow morning Lt. Gn. Grewal
will brief you about this operation.
You will do the entire
on ground planning with him.
Prepare the best team you can.
And revert back to me by the 23rd night
with each and every detail.
Understood, sir.
I wish you all the best.
Thank you very much, sir.
I've scoured these
hills for 40 years.
When I close my eyes,
I don't see my children's faces.
I see Kashmir's
territorial map instead.
And that's why Vihaan,
it will be easy to enter POK.
But what will be difficult
is getting out after the attack.
I understand, sir.
We will plan for everything.
Did you finalize the team?
Out of the soldiers
that died in the Uri attack...
most of them belonged
to the Dogra and Bihar Regiment.
My advice is that
we should include this regiment's
special team in this mission as well.
To win a war,
very often a soldier's emotions,
are more important than his training.
I want to put their anger
and passion to the right use.
At ease.
Commandos.
My name is Major Vihaan Shergill.
And that's Capt. Sartaj.
Please take your phones out.
Now send a text to your family.
Saying that you'll be in Udhampur till
the morning of the 29th of September...
for a special tactical training.
And you won't be allowed to communicate
with anyone during this training.
As a result,
you'll keep your phones
switched off for the next 7 days.
Send it.
Is it sent?
- Yes, sir.
Good. Sartaj.
Now you will all put
your phones in this bag.
And your phones will be returned to you
only on the morning of 29th September.
What I am going to tell you next...
shall never be mentioned
again until your last breath.
On the night of 28th September...
I will give you a chance to avenge our
brothers who died in the Uri attack.
Just like those coward
terrorists brutally killed...
our unarmed brothers
in their sleep...
we will give them a fitting reply...
A chance to behead them.
Are you ready for this mission?
- Yes, sir.
Is your blood boiling for revenge?
- Yes, sir.
Commandos.
Who are we?
- Indian army, sir!
The Indian Army did not start this war
but we will bloody hell finish it.
Yes, sir!
How is the spirit?
- High, sir!
How is the spirit?
- High, sir!
I said how is the spirit?
- High, sir!
Good!
Yes, sir.
It's completely our fault.
We'll definitely find out.
We'll have to.
Don't worry.
Goodbye.
You guys are bunch of stupid
lowlife nincompoops.
You don't have kids, right?
Don't even try.
For the past one month
I've been saying...
that there's a mole in our office who
has been syphoning information to India.
And you guys can't find him.
I swear.
I am starting to feel that...
that could it be one of you?
Can you even imagine
the pressure on me?
One week...
If you don't find
that guy in a week,
I'll have one of
you for dinner, and...
I won't even burp.
Don't just stand there
staring at my face.
Get lost.
And Karim, give that file to me.
Stupid idiots.
Mother, it's me.
Hello. How are you?
You wanted Bilqis
aunt's number, right?
Take a pen and note it down.
34...
49...
58...
8... 74...
2201...
Yes..
No, I'm feeling a little acidic.
The indigestion
is causing me to burp.
My stomach is not doing so well.
Also note down
Munnu uncle's number.
Sir, we got the coordinates.
There's a total of seven locations,
all close to LC.
We'll have to physically find the location
of their launchpads in these areas.
Call Srinivas at ISRO.
- Yes, sir.
The pictures from Tripura, Assam
are not clear due to heavy rains.
Hello.
- Govind speaking.
Bharadwaj.
Hi, Govind. Tell me.
Listen, I'm sending
you some coordinates.
I want you to position the
RISAT 1 or the RISAT 2 satellite
over these coordinates
for the next six days.
And don't move them, come what may.
- Okay.
Secondly, relay all the
images directly to Raisina Hills.
We have only two hours.
- Okay.
You will personally scan every
location with the Army Intelligence.
only when we have every
detail about the all the locations.
Correct?
- Yes, sir.
Done, sir.
Send this feed directly
to Raisina Hills.
Sir. We have the feed.
Pallavi.
Pallavi Sharma.
You asked me my real name that day.
I am really sorry about that day.
It's okay.
In fact, even I might have reacted
the same way if I was in your place.
How is your mom?
She is...
She is fine.
Neha is staying with her.
We've also appointed a
full-time nurse, so let's see.
I hope she's better than me.
I think its time. We should get going.
I'll look into this.
Sir.
Sir.
- Vihaan. Come, sit.
Have you selected your team?
- Yes, sir.
And what about their advanced
tactical commando training?
It's begun, sir.
- Good.
Pallavi. You can begin.
- Sir.
Sir, we've confirmed 5 launchpads
of Hizbul, Lashkar, and Jaish.
Two in Lipa Valley.
Two in Kel.
And one in Bhimber.
These launchpads were easy to find
because they were in isolated areas.
And the remaining two are...
possibly located in the populated
areas of the Muzaffarabad district.
Identifying the exact
location through satellites
in a crowded area
is a little difficult.
I will check at DRDO tomorrow,
whether they can help us
in finding the launchpads.
And Pallavi, keep giving Vihaan all
the details about these launchpads. - Sir.
Vihaan, any suggestion or question?
Which of these launchpads
were used for the Uri attack?
We believe that the attackers came from
one of the launchpads in Muzaffarabad.
And who was the
handler of that attack?
We still don't have any
information on that. Sorry.
These Sigma 5 drones
are our latest invention.
Developed along with...
Israeli intelligence.
Sir,
their range is
close to 50 kilometres.
And they can fly as low
as 2 kilometres above ground.
That's fine, Brian,
but how close can it come to the ground,
without getting detected.
Meaning?
Meaning I want a drone that can
fly outside our enemy's window...
without getting detected.
Sir, that technology
hasn't been invented yet.
I thought as much.
Sir, he's our intern.
What's your name, son?
- Ishaan.
Ishaan Wattal, sir.
What is this?
Sir, it's an unmanned aerial vehicle.
Shaped like an eagle.
What is it called?
- Garuda.
Garuda. Based on Vishnu Puran.
- Ahh... Vishnu Puran.
Sorry, since there are already
so many projects underway...
I use the spare parts
to pass some time. That's it.
Ishaan, make it fly. Come.
Sorry, sir.
Sir.
Sir, when I say so
you must run fast
and throw the Garuda
in the air with full force.
Just a minute, sir.
Raise your hand.
Higher, sir.
A little more.
Sorry, sir.
Sir, 3...
2...
1...
What's the range?
Sir, it can fly up to
a distance of 12 kilometres...
and its got four hours of
battery backup on a single charge.
Infrared and night vision enabled.
It has a 16-megapixel camera
and 7.2x digital zoom.
And it can also hover at one
place for take-off and landing...
Like...
this.
If it can hover at one
place for taking off and landing,
then why did you make Brian run.
Brian.
- Yes, sir.
I need four such
Garudas by tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Sir, this is just a prototype which
this kid has made just to pass time.
It hasn't been commissioned
yet and the R&amp;D for it...
Can four such Garudas
be made by tomorrow?
We can if the entire team chips in.
Good. Brian, stop everything else
and start a separate assembly line, and
put all your technicians to work on this.
Tomorrow afternoon I want Ishaan on a
flight to Kashmir along with four Garudas.
Okay.
You might have just
won us the war, son.
Good job.
Thank... Sorry, sir.
Sir.
Time to prove your
patriotism to Jaskirat.
You're going to be my pilot, Seerat.
Sir...
Excuse me.
- Yes.
Hello. - The army has arrested
two guides in Baramulla.
Chances are they have
information about the Uri attack.
Govind sir wants both of
us involved in the interrogation.
When are you leaving?
- 2 hours.
Palam Air Force Base.
Who was the handler for the
Uri attack?
Where was it planned?
I don't know anything, madam.
I sell nuts in Batmaylu...
Make another excuse
and I will burst your nuts.
Believe me, madam...
Oh Mother...
Oh Mother...
Who was involved in the Uri attack?
I want names.
Who was involved?
Who was the handler
for the Uri attack?
Oh Mother...
- Farooq, I need names.
Oh Mother...
Who were they?
- Oh Mother...
Oh Mother...
Who he is?
He's my brother?
What's his name?
Faizal.
Look Faizal,
we're running out of time.
Your brother has two options.
First,
he politely gives us the
name of the handler of the Uri attack.
Second,
I can spill your guts out.
Some tea?
No. Stop him, ma'am.
Please stop him, madam.
He's just a kid.
He will die, madam.
He's just a kid.
Madam.
Madam...
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.
Idris.
Idris Qayoom Al Baghdadi.
He made the plan.
And Jabbar Firozi was the handler.
This is Idris and that's Jabbar.
They were the planners
and handlers for the attack...
on Uri and on
Pampore before that.
Idris is from Sialkot
and Jabbar is from Gilgit.
Seven years ago they met in one of the
training camps of Jaish-e-Mohammad...
and a few years later,
under the supervision of Jaish...
they started their own
highly specialized terrorist group.
Sirat-UL-Jannat.
Their B-2 training center and
Launchpad is in the Chakothi village...
which is near the Aman Setu ridge
and Muzaffarabad district.
Their guides use the natural caves
situated in the jungles around them to...
infiltrate the terrorists into India.
We've given the army
the locations of these caves.
They are keeping
a watch on these caves.
Four UAVs will be sent to
Kashmir tomorrow from the DRDO...
for additional surveillance.
You must increase shelling
at the LC from tomorrow.
And keep increasing the intensity
gradually so that on the night of 28th...
we reach the
peak of our shelling.
Especially in the areas
from where our soldiers
will infiltrate into POK.
""I will fight.""
""I will fight.""
""The fire in my blood
makes me want to fight.""
""I will go to any lengths.
That's my heart's desire.""
""A passionate soul is ready to die
for his country. He is fearless.""
""The enemies are afraid of him.""
""A soldier fights till his last breath.""
""He faces death fearlessly
and leaves the enemies trembling.""
""I will fight.""
There are some boulders
here where you can hide...
but a Pakistani forward post is
at a distance of 60 meters from here.
Take the flight recorders
out of all the choppers.
And color it the same
way as the Pakistani Air Force.
""Our hearts are lit up
with our passion.""
""We are not afraid of holding
the flames in our hand.""
""We will do something admirable.""
""And set a good example
for the world.""
""I will fight...""
""It's the burning desire
of my heart to go to any lengths.""
""A soldier never gives up
even till his last breath.""
""He embraces danger
and brings down his enemies.""
""A brave heart is ready to die
for his country. He is heroic.""
""He embraces death
and doesn't spare his enemies.""
As of 0900 hours,
India has intensified the shelling.
I guess India is still looking
for a befitting reply to our
Prime Minister's speech at the UN.
Sir, I doubt whether this
shelling is for distracting us.
In case if they were
planning another attack...
then our intelligence agency
must have got some kind of news.
India is in no position
to think about another attack.
They are already in a difficult
position with the issue of Kashmir.
This drama will continue
a little longer at the LOC.
Our actors and singers
will be banned.
Trade will get affected.
But soon everything will cool down.
But, we should not make the mistake
of underestimating our enemy.
Zubair.
- Yes.
Afzal.
- Sir.
I should be getting
updates every minute.
Send all the ammunition
you can at the LOC.
We must give a
fitting reply as well.
Is that understood?
Yes, sir.
- Good.
What happened at the meeting today?
You're playing awkward shots today.
There was a strong debate over LOC.
The Indians have made our lives
difficult with their constant shelling.
Some important decisions
were taken today in the meeting.
Forget that.
Watch this shot.
Watch this.
No Zameer,
your head's not in the game today.
You know what, come home.
I'll tell Aasma to make your favourite
dish and your favourite dessert.
No. Not today.
I'll have to stay awake
all night with the Minister sir.
And tomorrow we might have
to go on a rendezvous of the LOC.
Maybe some other day.
What are you plans for 28th?
28... Yes, 28th is great.
Sure.
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.
Come let's look for the ball now.
Can you get me a closer shot?
- Yeah, sure.
Slightly to the right.
Good job, Ishaan. Good job.
Hey...
sit down.
Get it out now, Ishaan.
- I am trying.
Ishaan, come on. Come on, Ishaan.
Come on.
A toy.
Yes... yes...
Try.. come on, Ishaan.
Sir this is the B-2 launchpad
where the terrorist responsible
for the Uri attack came from.
A double storied building with 38 highly
trained terrorist and 5 exit points.
Has our intelligence
confirmed these details?
Yes, sir.
I've personally checked
every launchpad.
What is the plan to attack?
Sir, our 80 commandos
are fully prepared.
On the night of 28th, when
our shelling will be at its peak...
we'll enter POK in four
low flying MI-17 helicopters.
And we'll start our
attack at exactly 2 am.
These 80 commandos will be
divided into four teams of 20 each.
Every team will have
to destroy two targets.
Team Alpha, Along with
Major Vihaan, will first destroy B-1
and theJabbar and Idris' B-2 launchpad.
Similarly teams Bravo,
Charlie, Delta,
will destroy their targets
in Lipa, Bimber, and Kel.
On the positive side, all these
targets are quite close to the LC...
which means from landing
to take off, the entire mission...
should last only for 50 minutes.
Which means by 3 am
we should be back in our choppers.
And by 5 am...
we'll be at the Srinagar base.
There will be no
meetings here today.
As you've all been told earlier,
we'll spend a normal day tomorrow...
with the press and public.
On the 28th late night, there should
be no one here from the Ministry.
Other than the Army
Intelligence, only
Arjun and Govind will
be allowed to stay here.
Vihaan, when are
you leaving for Kashmir?
Sir, we leave tomorrow
from the Northern Command.
Vihaan, I've heard that you've promised
to bring all your soldiers back safe
and sound.
Sir, with your permission.
My commandos &amp; I would like to have
dinner with you on the 30th night.
Jai Hind.
Jai Hind, sir.
Capt. Ved.
Akram.
Bali.
You three will lead the Bravo, Charlie,
and Delta, teams.
As soon as we para-drop in POK,
we'll be easy targets.
So we must carefully, and stealthily,
make it to our launchpads.
Once we reach, again...
Outer parameters, Snipers.
Inner parameters, Assaulters.
Every team will be
carrying a signal jammer...
so that they cannot use radio-signals
or mobile phones to call for help...
during the attack.
Remember boys,
our return is the toughest part.
Our backs will be facing the enemy,
and they will be firing at us.
So we have to be quick.
Any questions?
- No, sir.
I've promised that you will all return
with me to India safe and sound.
And I bloody well intend
to keep my promise.
Jai Hind.
- Jai Hind.
Our assets in Muzaffarabad
and Gilgit have sent updates.
It says that India is going to escalate
their shelling at the maximum today.
Excuse me.
Sir.
Commandos.
The time has come
to make them bleed for their deeds.
They want Kashmir
and we want their heads.
Are you ready, boys?
- Yes, sir.
How is the spirit?
- High, sir.
How is the spirit?
- High, sir.
Jai Hind!
- Jai Hind!
Go. Go. Go.
All the best...
- All the best...
All the best... Go. Go.
It was really dark.
I was really doing her hard.
Little did I know
that she was a virgin.
Aasma.
- Yes.
Get some ice for Zameer.
Here. - Aasma, you've kept yourself busy
in the kitchen...
while we're getting
bored out here.
Come and join us.
I can't do two jobs at once especially
when I am cooking this exquisite dish.
I'll join you in a while.
You're looking much better today.
You've been really worried
for the past couple of days.
What can I say?
These Indians have
made my life hell.
I wonder what else they are
planning along with the shelling.
But our spies are
no less than them.
We've taken all the precautions.
Did you taste these dates?
Thank God, food is ready.
Now make me a large peg,
with lots of ice. - Of course.
So Zameer,
how is your better half?
She's in Birmingham.
For the graduation ceremony
of my youngest daughter.
I was supposed to go as well.
But all thanks to the issues on the
LOC,
which spoiled all my plans.
There's nothing we can do.
Well...
Cheers.
Aasma, since when
did you start drinking whiskey?
What?
You normally drink wine, don't you?
So I thought let's give
whiskey a shot instead.
There's something unique about...
women who drink whiskey.
Wow!
Let's go.
- We are taking off.
Salim, Raisina Hills.
Zameer?
Zameer?
Zameer?
Zameer?
Zameer? Zameer?
What was the decision taken
against India in today's meeting?
Were the words ""Surgical Strike""
used in the meeting today?
Were the words ""Surgical Strike""
used in the meeting today?
Zameer?
Dear, what are you doing?
- Zameer,
what was the decision
taken in the meeting today?
Zameer?
What did the Minister say?
Zameer?
Radar... AEWAC... radar.
We've received some
Intel from our spies.
They have spotted helicopters near
the LOC painted in Pakistani colours.
Their helicopters were repainted.
Maybe they are planning to fly low from
the LOC and attack our forward posts.
Is there any way we can stop them?
We should launch the AEWAC
radar near the Uri sector.
If the enemy helicopter comes anywhere
within 20 meters of the LOC...
then our anti-aircraft missiles
will shoot it down immediately.
Hello.
- Alpha Team needs to abort the mission.
I repeat, the Alpha
team must abort the mission.
What?
Sir.
We've detected air
activity at the LC.
Keep the anti-aircraft
missiles ready.
Sir.
- Pallavi,
has Vihaan's chopper taken off?
- Yes, sir.
They will cross LC in 10 seconds.
Connect me to Vihaan now.
Vihaan, I've patched
you with Govind sir.
Sir, Vihaan is online.
Vihaan, don't cross the LC.
I repeat, do not cross the LC.
Turn your choppers around.
Turn around! Turn around!
They have launched the
AEWAC radar in Muzaffarabad sector.
That means Alpha
team cannot cross by air.
We'll have to abort your mission.
Pallavi, listen.
During Farooq's
interrogation he said that...
he used to bring terrorists
to India through the caves...
which our army
is keeping an eye on.
Get me the exact
coordinates to those caves.
If we can't go through the air,
then we'll go by land.
But we will complete this
mission today at any cost.
Bravo, Charlie, Delta,
you
three will move ahead as planned.
There will be radio silence
amongst all the teams now.
We'll only be in touch with
the army intelligence directly.
They will keep me posted.
Correct! Bravo, Charlie, Delta...
Your areas are safe
according to Intelligence.
Move ahead as planned.
Sir.
- What's the status?
Sir, we are still figuring out
the coordinates.
Thank you.
- Welcome sir.
Let's go.
Sir, entering a cave blindly without a
recce and monitoring is way to risky.
There might be Rangers or Terrorists
posted for guarding these caves.
Vihaan, wait.
Is Ishaan online? Can he hear us?
Yes, sir. He can.
Ishaan.
- Sir.
Can you see the GPS location
of all the four teams?
Yes, sir. I can see it.
- Good.
From now on you're
going to be their eyes.
Tell the operators
that all the four Garudas...
will stay a few meters
ahead of the team leaders.
And you keep tracking
their position through GPS.
As soon as you sense any danger,
you must inform the team leader.
Sure, sir.
Sir!
Sir, we're in Pakistan
Occupied Kashmir.
Good job, Vihaan.
The other teams are
soon reaching their targets.
Bilal? Dawood?
Say hello to your brothers in hell.
And ask them to hold on
to the celebrations.
We plan to send them
a lot more guests tonight.
Sir, the first
operation was a success.
We've destroyed the B-1 launchpad.
What is the status
of the remaining teams?
Teams Bravo and Charlie have
attacked their secondary location.
Team Delta is preparing to return
after completing their mission.
Not a single casualty.
- Good.
Let's go.
Abdullah!
- Yes.
Come here.
Take Zameer sir home. He's had
a little too much to drink today.
Yes.
Come on... Go out quickly.
Where is Idris?
Where is Idris?
Where is Idris?
Camera!
Camera!
Camera!
Did you find Idris?
No, sir.
I don't think he's here.
He's here.
Sir, someone has informed the Police.
They are just two minutes away.
Vihaan, hurry up.
Copy, sir.
But Idris has to die.
- But, Vihaan.
Sartaj, move.
You barged into my home
and killed my brothers.
Today I barged into your
home and I'm killing your brothers.
We are the Indian Army.
Indian Army!
Ishaan, where to?
Sir, lower east side. Out
the small door and into the fields.
Who's there? I'll shoot.
Sartaj.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
Boys go faster. Faster. Faster.
Sir, be ready. We're getting
a Pakistani chopper along with us.
Vihaan, we're sending
jets to give you cover fire.
They will be at your
location in 10 minutes.
Copy, sir.
Sir, we're running
out of ammunition.
We can't hold them
off for 10 minutes.
Come what may, but every soldier
will make it back home alive today.
Seerat, now!
Jaskirat, this is for you.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Sir, we did it.
Bravo, Charlie, Delta,
what's your status?
Every mission was a success.
Not a single casualty.
I am extremely
proud of you my boys.
Thank you, sir.
Congratulations, sir.
Sir,
the mission was a success.
Commandos.
- Yes, sir.
How's the spirit?
- High sir!
How's the spirit?
- High sir!
Jai Hind!
- Jai Hind.
Jai Hind!
- Jai Hind.
Jai Hind!
- Jai Hind.

Who is Mehra?
Did you tell him I am coming?
- Yes, I did.
Come on, let's go. - Let's Go.
This way. - Listen.
Keep this. That's 2000. - Yes.
Publish my photo
in the newspaper. - Yes.
Come, brother. This way.
Come, brother.
Are the arrangements okay?
- Wonderful.
Hello, sir. -Welcome, Mr. Mehra.
Take it.
Will I have to come
down to the police station?
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Listen to me, brother.
Brother... listen to me.
Stand up. - Brother...
I paid you for the
entire face. - Yes.
All you published was my hand.
Yes.
I will return your money.
All of it. Every cent.
What? - I swear.
I will return the money.
You think I was beating
you for the money.
No...
Experts feel that this
election will be fought...
on just one issue,
and that's division of the state.
The government will have to...
I hope you will cure me
before the next elections, Bakshi.
You will be walking without
any support within a year.
That's my guarantee.
Slowly.
Which fool brought these video games?
He doesn't want me to get well soon.
I want to dance without
anyone's support.
Greetings, Her Highness.
Son, I want to see you dance as well.
Greetings, Rani Ma.
After you're cured...
your first duty is to
give this family a successor.
Your daughter-in-law
is no longer fit for this job.
She's just my official wife now.
And the government's
good for nothing.
Then get married again.
How did come up with that idea?
It's like showing
Switzerland to the blind.
Ranjana. Bunny's daughter.
Did you have a word? - Yes.
So, should we start
packing for Switzerland?
Hello, It's Rudra Singh.
Hi, Rudy. How are you?
There's a problem.
Official? - No, personal.
Woman.
The government took away our powers,
but not nature.
So, who was it?
Dhanraj Makhija,
a businessman from Agra.
I would get him small
tenders in my area.
One day he visited me
in the hotel with his wife.
This time,
it was a 2 million bridge tender.
Rudra Pratap. Remember I told you...
I'm sure the bridge was
constructed the same day.
The rascal made a video.
He's threatening me now.
Wants all the tenders in the area.
A businessman,
who's not scared of the MLA.
You must be the only
politician in the country...
who doesn't scare anybody.
Forget that, what's the solution?
Makhija's trying to blackmail you,
using his wife.
Possible.
Maybe he wants to
get rid of his wife too.
But, I'm sure his wife
has no clue about it.
And you will tell her.
And explain her everything
while wiping her tears.
Where to bring him, how?
And yes, he should be alone.
We've been going around in circles.
Was it the one we just passed by?
How would a factory
look in such a small space?
Rudy's giving us a big contract.
He wants us to see the land.
But you've no patience.
It's not about patience.
We're no longer in Rudy's area.
And this is Aditya
Pratap Singh's area.
Yes, so what? They're friends.
Maybe they're planning
something together.
Be quiet.
No need to fear anyone.
Except me.
Inform the police 15 minutes later.
Send 50,000 to the police station.
Yes.
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!
Let's get out of here.
Yes. - Sir, the police
have arrested my son-in-law.
They arrested him for stealing.
- Call from the CM's office.
Say that I will call him later.
And, Kanhaiyya, call the SP?
The irrigation process between
Satpalgaj to Mejha is stalled.
The budget's been sanctioned.
But ma'am hasn't signed it yet.
Leave the file here.
Collect it in the evening.
And, take me to Choti Rani,
I want to talk to her.
Yes.
Rudy. I'll see you
in 10 minutes. - Okay.
Choti Rani!
Madhvi.
Madhvi!
Madhvi!
You!
When did you arrive?
You're not well.
I am absolutely fine.
First, go wear something decent.
I've forsaken all
decency in front of you.
So, why this formality?
You call me by my name now.
Earlier, you would say
'Choti Rani' so romantically.
Let me warn you. - Yes.
Don't try to seduce me.
I won't fall for that again.
And you don't look
nice doing all this.
I feel like paying for it.
Fine, pay me.
That will make me happy.
You've become so cheap.
I don't have loose
change to spare for you...
You're the local MLA.
I'm leaving this file behind.
Sign them when you're
back to your senses.
Kanhaiyya.
Saheb. I need some money...
Kan haiyya.
I've spent it all.
Saheb. Saheb, please.
Saheb, I really need money.
Come on, move your hands faster.
It'll start raining any moment.
Bunny uncle's sent an invitation.
Polo Match.
Will you go?
No.
He didn't reply to my proposal.
No need to go.
I wouldn't have if you hadn't
shown me Ranjana's picture.
We'll go.
We will all go.
We've to win this match.
Greetings, Her Highness.
Hello, Her Highness.
Polo match?
Looking for a groom for Rachna?
You know everything that
goes around in this kingdom.
I'll come to you when
I start looking for one.
How are you, Madhvi?
- Very well, uncle.
Is Vishi back from Dubai?
He'll be here soon.
Maybe his flight is delayed.
Welcome.
Hi Aditya.
Did you forget about my proposal...
or, you didn't
think it was important?
Let's go inside and talk.
People are eagerly waiting for you.
Hello, Sheena, how are you? - Hello?
How are you?
I'm fine, how about you?
Yeah.
Hi.
Hello, Ranjana. - Hello.
How are you?
- I'm fine, how about you?
So, what're you up to these days?
Looking nice. - You too.
Thank you.
Cheers.
Hello.
Sir's busy in a meeting.
He'll call you back later.
Yes, sir.
Didn't you take
a bullet in the chest?
Your master survived as well.
Yes. - How?
Those who speak less, live longer.
So you think by doing
this we'll be richer.
You can consider that.
With four different states,
we'll receive more funds.
More development.
But, you will still be
in power in all the four states.
You will benefit
from the development.
I... am not in favor
of dividing Uttar Pradesh.
This can be your personal view,
but the other MLA's...
That's them.
Ask them.
Listen. Where did they come from?
They are sitting there.
I see. - Yes.
I see.
Hello, Virender Singh.
Look, I must know the
number of MLA's supporting us.
Only after that,
will I bring this up in the assembly.
Mr. Tiwari. -Yes.
We'll discuss this
personally and let you know.
Fine. But, hurry up.
Because the CM's facing
a lot of pressure.
And, please control him.
Every issue is a
matter of pride for him.
We'll let you know soon.
What happened?
I'm certainly losing this election.
Because there's been
no development in my area.
And now, no one will
vote you for who you are.
And now, we're running independently.
Where will the funds come from?
Quiet!
People address us as 'Rajaji' (king).
If we separate, we'll lose power.
We'll have to join his party and
then, I'll be called a politician.
It's not music to my ears.
There are other
ways to collect funds.
Let's discuss this later.
It's time.
The horses must be getting restless.
Come on.
Let's move.
Let's go.
Bunny uncle.
We need to talk.
Don't worry.
It's a different issue.
Is it true? - One moment.
Is everything okay? -Yes thank you.
What were you doing?
We've guests over.
I was with them.
Yes, I saw them coming.
They didn't look royal to me.
They look more like
government officials.
They've lost what we still maintain.
Do you get it?
They can't ride a horse?
What do you want to say?
Are they discussing your marriage?
Not that I heard of.
You want to marry Ranjana.
H ow?
Okay, you might start
walking in a year or two.
But you're a married man.
Bunny uncle,
you sound like a democratic.
I am a king!
I can afford an extra wife.
And I don't need any
government fund for that.
I heard that Aditya
Pratap Singh's here too.
Yes.
How does he look?
They all look the
same on a wheelchair.
Helpless.
He took a bullet, but survived.
I know.
Do you know why he survived?
He has to die by my hands.
It's not possible. - Only if you try.
And you can.
You're a king, so am I.
But your blood's cooled down,
not mine.
Hello.
Yes, son.
What?
Who... who's with you?
Pardon me, Your Highness.
But, master wants to speak.
Don't you see I'm
speaking over the phone.
It's important.
This is just as much important.
Call from Dubai?
I heard that your son Vishi
was caught red-handed with drugs.
They've strict laws.
And drugs is a serious of fence.
You're such a lowly man.
If I can get your son in
trouble in Dubai from here...
then your home's
just 300 kilometers away.
I can get Ranjana abducted.
Many kings have abducted
their brides in the past.
We don't call them lowly but gallant.
A few affluent Sheiks in
Dubai studied with me in London.
We're good friends.
Come down to my place with the token.
I'll keep Ranjana happy.
You have forgotten our
relationship by mistake.
Didn't you think it
necessary to keep it in mind?
If I can get your son in
trouble in Dubai from here...
then your home's
just 300 kilometers away.
Father, did you just fire a bullet?
Yes. I did.
But why?
I wanted to kill myself.
But then, I thought about you.
Sit.
That's fate.
Sure you got a job,
but where did you get transferred?
Do you get me?
Listen.
God's trying to say something to you.
Here, talk to brother.
Yes, Param. When are you joining?
Speak slowly.
No, I could send...
- Yes, Your Highness.
I'll send your stuff over.
You mean, I am more like security.
If you hand me over,
brother will be set free.
We've been humiliated, dear.
Aditya Pratap Singh has mortified us.
I am retaliating.
And you are my weapon.
That doesn't make sense.
What can I possibly do?
I am not sending you alone.
Your Highness,
lnderjeet Singh's here.
Send him in.
Your Highness.
You played well today.
Three of our riders were tired...
otherwise,
I would have scored two more goals.
And then...
Why did you hit the
ball towards Aditya Singh?
It was a mistake.
I wanted to turn,
but the horse didn't...
so the shot went straight.
You did the right thing.
What?
I know that wasn't a mistake.
You were trying to fuel the war...
your grandfather lost
to Aditya Singh's family.
You were just inflaming that.
It was a mistake, Your Highness.
I couldn't control myself.
Aditya Singh wants to marry Ranjana.
When I refused...
he got my son arrested
for drugs in Dubai,
I'm giving my approval
for the engagement.
But... I want Aditya
Singh dead before the wedding.
The government wants
to finish his power.
And I want his honor...
You can take his life,
if you're interested.
Look.
Channel your anger properly.
Kings don't look
nice out on the streets.
Please listen to me...
I just don't understand.
This doesn't feel right.
Your Highness.
I can end my war by
taking Aditya Singh's life.
But, finishing his power
and honor will take time.
And, after that's done,
I would like to marry Ranjana.
Trying to take advantage?
That means,
I will have to fight with you next.
I accept.
You want this war, don't you?
So be it.
And it'll be a fierce one.
Swear on you.
It wasn't supposed to be like this.
Come with me. Ratan.
Yes, Her Highness.
- What are you doing?
See whether the red lamp's
been lit or not. Okay?
Light-up all the lamps.
Hurry up, and I want this polished...
Listen. What's going on here?
The master has thrown a party...
Go.
I hope you didn't have
a problem finding the place.
No, not at all.
We saw a polo match
after a long time.
Greetings.
Hello.
Hello, Madhvi.
I didn't know Saheb's thrown a party.
He didn't tell you? - No.
No one tells me anything these days.
You don't talk to me either.
We would if you stay in your senses.
Don't create a scene today, Madhvi.
Why?
Anything special?
Your presence here is supporting.
You know I was against it.
Glittering dreams.
Beautiful dreams.
Glittering dreams.
Beautiful dreams.
But... if you wake up...
Dreams shatter like glass... Hey.
Some fall here, some there.
Hey.
Some fall here, some there.
Hey.
Careful with that platter.
The drink's untouched.
Don't let it slip.
Or it's no good.
All those dreams in your eyes.
Will spill over.
All those dreams in your eyes.
Will spill over.
Some which got spilt over..
Some magical dreams.
Some fall here, some there.
Hey.
Some fall here, some there.
Hey.
Love's divided here...
like a deck of cards.
If you win the game, you get lucky.
These mischievous dreams
are just an illusion.
These mischievous
dreams are an illusion.
If you let dust gather on it,
it's worth nothing.
Some fall here, some there.
Hey.
Glittering dreams.
Beautiful dreams.
Glittering dreams.
Beautiful dreams.
Goodnight, Aditya, love you.
Bye, Rudy. Bye-
When will Vishi return?
He'll be back in a day or two.
All this is against everyone's will.
Forsake your anger.
It's the beginning of a new relation.
I'm not uttering a word.
You asked Ranjana to stay back.
Did I say a word?
The only reason I asked
Ranjana to stay back...
is so that she could
understand me, know me better.
If she stays here...
What will the people
say if she stays here?
I want her to see her defamed.
So that anyone thinks twice
before sending a proposal.
Come closer, because
this moment won't come again.
Take me in your arms,
and let those tears fall.
Wonder if love will
ever dwell in these eyes.
We might not meet
again in this lifetime.
Hold me close...
Stop that music!
This night may...
Glory to... - Madhvi ma'am!
Glory to... - 'Choti Rani'!
Did you sleep properly?
Yes.
I know you like photography.
What else do you like?
Why don't you tell me
about your likes and dislikes?
I'll keep it in mind.
My likes and dislikes
are not the law here.
Seems like that.
If I make a mistake,
I'll be punished.
Don't say that.
I fell in love with your picture.
Remember,
I'll just be an image for you.
I won't make a mistake.
I will keep trying...
to bring you to life.
Remember.
The day I get up from this chair...
I'll marry you.
Greetings.
Greetings.
I get it.
I'll call you later.
How's everything?
- Everything's fine.
No problem at all.
It's all your grace.
I meant our area.
There's prosperity in our area.
Everyone's happy.
What do you do?
I am the PA to His Highness.
His Highness?
I mean, your PA.
What are his appointments for today?
Nothing important.
I can see there's nothing
special going on here.
People are simply loathing around.
Loathing.
Where's the money?
Where does he keep the money?
Money?
Madam.
There's no money here.
Only sir keeps them.
I need some money.
Madam... I've some money.
I'll take them from sir later.
How far is Jagdishpur?
How long will you keep
up with this hunger strike?
Greetings, Her Highness.
Until our last breath.
Come, sit.
How can they mow down
our fields and build a highway?
That will change the entire
geography of the village.
Her Highness,
what are you doing here?
What brings you here?
It's a hunger-strike,
I thought I should pay you a visit.
If I don't, who else will?
Our battle is with
the central government.
It's not your fault.
And, it's not in your power.
So, what can you do?
I know it's not within my power.
But your grief's intolerable.
Who's drinking?
Umesh, you?
Everyone's here on a hunger-strike...
and you're drunk.
This is an agitation,
tie him up to the tree.
Rascal.
Let me know if you need anything.
We need a lot of things,
Her Highness.
I'll leave.
I'll send you some help.
Who is that?
Hello, Madhvi.
I hail from this area.
I'm returning after
a number of years.
So, I want to make an investment.
Nothing special. I just
want to do something for my land.
Is he the new collector?
I'm not expecting profits,
just a big name for myself.
First tell me your name...
""then I'll tell you
a way to make it big.
Inder.
Inderjeet Singh...
You take your name with pride.
What can I do for you, Mr...
lnderjeet Singh.
Just your support,
and soon you'll feel proud too.
Why do I get always get men?
Why not poets?
I will learn, gradually.
In your company.
You don't make a poet.
They're born.
You love someone.
You never love someone.
One always falls in love.
And it shows.
Leave that.
What do you want?
I'll be right back.
This is a donation for your party.
I won independently.
I have no party. - Yes.
It's our first meeting,
I can't be too brazen.
Keep up the hunger-strike.
We'll keep up this hunger-strike.
Don't give up. - Never.
Glory to... - Madhvi ma'am!
Glory to... - 'Choti Rani'!
Let's form a party then.
You're now my treasurer.
A man, poet and a treasurer.
I need all three to look after me.
Do you have a card?
It's under print.
You try.
Guns don't interest me.
I'm not interested in guns either.
It's a necessity to stay alive.
I've... taken up photography.
Like you.
Pick up the gun.
Here you go.
Take this.22.
It's a one of the best rifles.
Take it,
Vishi will be set free tomorrow.
You won't applaud, right?
Because, I might like it.
Right.
Hand me that gun. Come on.
Looking at your condition...
its best to keep
this gun away from you.
You don't always need
a gun to kill someone.
Just like you took mine.
No bullets fired.
No accusations. Right?
How do you like it here?
Feels nice.
You're getting used to this place.
It's been just two days
and you're already lying.
Madhvi!
Sorry.
What's wrong, Sunder? - Sir...
Yes, dear. I know.
It's a mad house.
But I feel bad for Madhvi.
I think she needs a doctor.
That woman is very smart.
Inder met her today.
He charmed her and
she was more than willing.
She said You can be my treasurer.
Father, I'll talk to you later.
Okay, dear. No problem.
Do you have a license for this gun?
What the...
Look at you.
Something's still missing.
You're just...
Greetings. - Okay, okay.
I'm new on this job.
Give me some time.
Soon, I'll look fitting.
He's joined the police force.
And do you know where
he's been posted?
Here.
That's been bothering me as well.
I mean, out of all the places in UP.
It's such a big coincidence,
Your Highness.
This isn't fluke,
someone's pulling the strings.
We aren't fighting without a reason.
We're building an army.
You need to check these files.
Requests from irrigation,
forest and PWD departments.
Greetings, madam.
It's nice to see you here.
There's a lawyer, Madhukar Asthana.
He's filed a PIL against the DM...
regarding the road construction.
He's really troubled.
And wants your help.
What's... a PIL?
Sir.
Greetings, sir.
Yes.
He wants to speak to you.
Yes.
Suddenly, you just realized
your responsibilities.
Good.
You know how to sign.
Just sign where I tell you to.
If you need some money
take it from Sunder.
Sir has sent some money.
I don't need it.
Sir... -You can go.
Go.
Does the car run smoothly?
- Yes, sir. It does.
Kanta. - Yes, Your Highness.
The shrubs have outgrown.
Get them trimmed.
Your Highness, I'll get
some clothes stitched. - Yes.
Ranjana has sent some designs,
they're just right.
No need to ask me for everything.
It's your money,
I'll have to keep an account.
I'll deduct it. -What?
Deduct? How?
From your dowry.
Yes, that's right.
Madhvi's calling.
I think she needs you.
Keep your clothes on.
She's takes them off.
If your clothes come off...
you'll never be
able to repay my debt.
No, Your Highness.
I'm not that weak.
Focus on the issue. - Yes.
That's the only weakness
we kings have...
which turns into our defeat.
Right? - Yes, that's true.
It's lnder.
You called? - Yes.
Hello - I...
Hello.
I... need help. - Help for what?
I want to learn politics.
I want to learn politics.
Madhvi, just like poets are born,
so are politicians.
Why do you want to
learn such a vile thing?
Just maintain your decree,
I will handle the politics.
Okay?
Hello, Mr. Tiwari - Hello.
Good morning, sir.
Sir, there's a letter
from the Ministry.
And, there's another letter...
Yes.
Sir, the Collector
from Mejha is here.
And ajournalist from the Indian Age.
Indian Age? - Yes, sir.
Send him in. -Yes, sir.
Listen. -Yes, sir.
Is it a man or a woman?
It's a man. - I see.
Fine, send him in.
Sir, your signatures... - Go out.
Good morning, sir. - Good morning.
Please close the door.
I see.
I am lndrajeet Singh,
from the Indian Age. - Okay.
We're starting a new column.
We'll be publishing the profiles...
of the top five
politicians of the state.
Profile?
Please take a seat.
Look, everyone publishes
about their work.
How's the personality?
Personality! How is it?
I mean, Prabhu Tiwari
as a person is...
He's nice.
So, shall we start? - Yes, please.
Ready?
No problem.
Are you sensitive? - What?
I mean feelings, emotions?
- Sensitive?
Sensitive.
Yes. I am a sensitive man.
So, what is Prabhu Tiwari?
Suppose, we need to describe
him in one word. -Yeah.
So what example will you give?
An honest man.
No, no human.
Compare yourself to something.
Something like Prabhu
Tiwari is like water. - Yeah.
Calm.
Or he's like fire.
Or like a cycle.
Cycle?
It keeps running without fuel.
More output, less expensive.
Then Prabhu Tiwari... is an ox!
Ox? - A hard working ox!
Ox!
That can have other meanings, sir.
What?
You're not smart.
Then forget it.
Your next question please.
Allow me... - Just delete it.
Say that you're a tomato. - Tomato?
It looks nice.
Use it in pickles,
or in food, eat it raw, it's healthy.
Everyone eats it.
It does have a lot of variety?
- Yes. Of course.
Mr. lnder, excuse me.
That makes two. - Two tomatoes?
No. One is sensitive.
And the second is tomato.
Yes, right. Okay.
This is lndrajeet speaking, and...
Prabhu Tiwari is a very,
very sensitive tomato...
So, sir. Do you like reading?
Reading? - Yes.
I like reading a lot.
In fact...
I've read more autobiographies.
Pundit Nehru. Gandhiji.
What are human values? - What?
Human values. - I see.
You know, human.
First, know the people...
then become their leader.
You can dream about
the moon later...
first learn to live on earth.
Wow.
Just a second. Let me write it down.
I always write these things down.
Excuse me.
The laptop...
What... is it? - Please don't bother,
please, please.
The door's opened too.
Ramcharan!
Do you know how to turn this off,
Mr. lnder?
I'll try. - Please. Please.
Who touched my laptop?
Who touched my laptop?
- Just a minute.
Mr. lnder,
you've seen such a vile thing...
But, please don't
forget to mention...
that I am a honest man.
Would... you...
like a cold drink? - Yes...
Let it be. - No...
Let it be. - Pande...
Sir, don't bother.
Send two cold drinks...
- Let it be...
Immediately!
That's not done.
What other hobbies do you like?
Nothing much.
Do you every cry?
It's my... humble request.
Don't mention these things, please.
It's not for the interview.
I meant,
bad days are around the corner.
I've heard that the
Chief Minister's changing.
He's facing difficulties
dividing the states.
Who told you that?
The CM's not being changed.
Those four MLAs, the four kings.
They aren't agreeing.
Aditya Pratap Singh's stopping them.
You seem to have
a lot of information.
How do you know?
I am a reporter, sir. Journalist.
I know in which direction
the wind is blowing, and how?
Tell me something else.
How about I fix
a meeting with Madhvi?
What good will that do?
We need Saheb's approval.
Madhvi doesn't listen to Saheb now.
I will make Madhvi join your party...
and you give her some small post.
Something like a Welfare program.
Mr. lndrajeet. -Yes.
Did you play this adult film?
Independent MLA candidate
Madhvi Singh from Devgarh...
was appointed President
of 'Women's Welfare Program'.
It's just cheat, lies and deceit.
It's a place for selfishness.
- I take your leave.
I only compromised for Ranjana.
That's all.
Revenge is bloody.
Greed, desires, lust, anger.
Revenge is bloody.
Greed, desires, lust, anger.
Every culprit's innocent.
There's anger in love.
Even the dead are restless.
Jealousy's your only strength.
Who was he?
The Prince of Jagdalpur.
I have just barged in.
Lam climbing up your stairs.
The colours of the walls are fine.
We'll need some curtains.
Yes, change them.
Princess?
Your fragrance...
How are you?
Just...
Can't sleep.
Let me help you.
How does this open?
Where does it open from?
Take a look.
Will I have to tear it? - No.
Hold on for five seconds,
you can do it, sir.
Bravo. You can do it, sir.
My father-in-law's father.
Back in those days he
owned an air-strip. - Okay.
Two planes. - Right.
He never got along with the British.
But he completed his
entire education in England.
Wonderful.
This is our ancestral sword. - Wow!
Hemangi. - Yes.
Come on.
Ma'am, tell us something
about your cuisine.
How was it before
and what is the change?
Back then we had a lot of people.
We always had some guest over.
Parties. Servants and maids.
Today, we cook as much
as any normal family.
But, there are few
recipes we still make.
Excuse me.
Good afternoon, Your Highness.
I want you to leave.
This... this won't take
more than half an hour, sir.
Seriously. Come on.
Hey you, camera. Please.
They're just asking normal questions,
nothing political.
What were you showing them?
What we were...
There are just a handful of us.
Take a picture,
we might go extinct someday.
We're still alive.
We haven't perished away.
We've a history.
And we'll keep making history.
This is my home, not a bloody museum!
Take your gun out.
Here?
We'll venerate him.
Cap.
No...
No, brother.
You've already anointed
him with your blood.
There's no need for this.
- Look here.
Grandpa's watching.
You already...
It'll hurt...
What are you doing, Param?
Just a small one.
It's hurting...
- Grandpa's asking for sacrifice.
It's hurting. - Let go.
Slowly. Slowly!
Chetia. Chetia. Chetia.
Call for you.
Hello.
UP 17 X 3851.
Get down.
Get back.
Hold him. Hold him.
Bullets.
Hold him. Hold him.
They were in my pockets.
Found it.
Got him! - I hit him first.
Brother!
The pain!
That's not him.
It's not him.
He's not the one in Ranjana's photo.
How can that be?
Madhvi's going with you. - Yes.
Mr. Saxena is royal blood.
His father was the Principal
Secretary, Madhya Pradesh.
Yes.
Often money's not their weakness.
Return it to her. - Yes.
The highway's become
dangerous these days. - Yes.
You carry a weapon, too. Show me.
I do, but never use it.
Here.
Hand it here, Mr. Jaiswal. - Here.
This can take your life,
don't treat it like a bride.
Where you seduce her for two hours,
and the rest in two minutes.
This is how you use it...
Careful, the bride will die.
Sit down.
Sit here.
Ranjana says she's going back. - Yes.
She's bored here.
She has read all the all the books...
- Please leave.
You will be late for the meeting.
I am travelling out of the city.
If I could have my gun back.
I was about to give it back.
No need to be scared now.
I'm always scared.
What if the gun
turns brazen like you?
And fires on anyone, anywhere.
Please excuse me,
I'm waiting outside.
Now you humiliate me
in front of strangers as well.
Every time I look at you,
I feel like misbehaving.
Don't talk too much in the meeting,
Just smile a few times.
And no drinking.
Master, Vasanfs here.
Don't treat her like
that in my presence.
I didn't say all that to please you.
Do you know why men
use more abusive language?
Because they don't cry much.
I'll be back in awhile.
Stay quiet.
Saheb.
They killed four of our men.
And Chetia's... missing.
So, why come here?
The police isn't behind this.
Has it fired from the rifle?
It's someone else, Saheb.
Don't come here for a few days.
I will call you.
And stay low, understand.
Yes, Saheb.
Look after yourself.
Yes.
Madam...
Have you ever met the Secretary?
No. Never.
I've heard that he's a difficult man.
Madam, excuse me.
You better not drink today. Please.
You just said he's a difficult man.
So, I'll have to act difficult too.
Mr. Jaiswal, this project
is important for the government.
This bridge will
benefit four districts.
Sir, we've studied the project.
Now, you guide us.
The forest department's
involved in this.
Waterworks too.
They'll all give preference
to their candidates.
There will be a tender.
You can fill that too.
Madam, sugar?
As much as you like.
What?
When things aren't our way...
Then, why don't you add
sugar as much as you want.
Whether you get the tender or not...
but you will surely
get a good cup of tea.
I've heard a lot about you.
Mr. Jaiswal.
Yes, madam.
Will you please leave us alone?
Yes.
Okay, sir.
Perfect.
Shalini.
Please go out.
Just arrange for the money.
And soon.
Consider it done.
I never waste time.
Driver, let's go.
Madam, how was the meeting?
I've requested him.
Let's wait and watch.
You've requested him,
he'll definitely say yes.
I've to go somewhere, alone.
Where can I drop you?
Drink? - Now?
I never drink during the day.
People like you give
a bad name to nights.
I'm busy during the day.
So, did you do it?
It's done. - Done?
You will get the tender.
WOW!
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
You look different.
It's just...
I got this stitched in Lucknow.
I found a decent tailor in Lucknow.
Like they say God made men,
and the tailor made gentlemen.
You wish to be a king too.
No, Madhvi, I am.
I thought I would tell
you this on a better occasion.
So, today is the time.
The ruins near the river
in your area used to be our fort.
Saheb's ancestors
decimated my entire family.
Only one boy survived,
who continued the lineage.
It's been three generations...
but, no one ever thought
of winning that fort back.
I wonder why these thoughts...
have been troubling
me since my childhood days.
Do you have anything else to say?
Anything else?
Madhvi, I was just trying to tell
you the truth that's in my heart...
No. You've a sharp mind.
Very sharp.
You're... getting angry...
I've no friends.
Not a single one.
Don't say that. You've me.
You'll see me in the tears...
I mean, in your tears.
For you, I hold no value.
But soon you will yearn for me.
See, I turned a poet for you.
So, when will you be a man?
Whenever you want?
Just give the orders.
Who do you want to kill?
We will help each other.
But it'll be my decision
to end this war.
I want to finish Saheb's power.
But he should be unharmed.
I'm not concerned about his health.
When I've his power.
Every time you look at me,
do you feel love?
Yes.
Every word you say casts a spell.
Yes.
See, you're lying.
But I trust you.
Come on.
He thrashed me severely, brother.
Made me drink chilly water.
Don't spare him.
Don't spare him.
Don't spare him.
Don't spare him.
Don't spare him.
Throw them in.
I'll tell you where to go.
He beats really cruelly.
Come here.
Brother! - Shut up!
Come here. I won't hurt you,
I just want to talk.
Come on.
He won't spare you. - Sit. Sit.
No, brother. - Shut up.
I won't beat you.
I just want to talk.
Look, I can kill you right now.
You will die.
Speak up, and you could be spared.
Get it.
No. No, brother.
No.
Kill him.
That's been taken care of. Okay.
He was a traitor.
He had to die.
But, the one you're
asking me to betray...
will never spare us alive.
Listen.
This is a serious matter.
Don't make it confusing.
Everyone has to die.
You can die today,
or maybe live for a day or two.
Wait until the next elections.
Or the next Shahrukh Khan movie.
There's nothing wrong.
Who informed you that...
the highway gangs
are being brought here?
We don't know anything.
Sir, it must be the one
who's bringing those dacoits here.
We'll wait a while and see.
Bring them, but who?
Sir.
What...
What's going on? Media?
Just a minute, sir.
They'll testify in
front of the media...
and it will become public.
No one will call
you to set them free.
But... who gave you
permission to do all this?
Sir, I didn't have the permission...
but, I did the right thing.
You can get your picture taken.
Chauhan, bring them out.
Sir, let us talk to them...
- Stay back!
Back. Back. Move back.
They are criminals, not politicians.
Stay back.
Maintain distance.
Someone wants to talk to you.
Just because you're from
a well-known newspaper..
""Doesn't mean you do as you please.
Sir's right here,
there's a protocol to be followed.
Sir. - Yes, go ahead.
How long have you been
committing these loots?
For the past two-three years.
Ask him who he works for?
So, who do you work for?
Kanhaiyya, he's our chief.
Kanhaiyya Saheb...
Are you here to arrest Kanhaiyya?
Vasant's given a false statement.
You were supposed to get arrested...
but, he took
Kanhaiyya's name instead.
Sir, here's the death certificate.
You can take the
dead body for cremation.
Show me.
Wait.
How did he die?
Shocked.
He couldn't tolerate
this humiliation.
And he died of shock.
I know it all.
You're the real chief.
He was just a soldier.
You're a soldier too.
So, who is your chief?
Just tell me.
You won't like to hear it.
You won't be able to
endure two shocks in one day.
Hello. - Can we talk?
Yes.
I can't say it over the phone.
Can you come over here?
So suddenly? - It's urgent.
Fine. Tomorrow then. - Make it today.
I'll have to pack.
Pack only for day.
And come today.
Jagdish.
Jagdish!
Yes... Yes Saheb.
That's been done, madam.
And the new file's been passed...
- Madam.
Madam, our application...
Pass me the N65.
Turn the phone on, sir.
Stop that car at the left.
I'll be right back.
Hello.
I've been calling you for two hours.
My phone was switched off.
It wasn't working,
so I gave it for repairing.
I just got it back.
Look, I've been called to Devgarh.
- Devgarh?
Yes.
So suddenly?
For how long?
I was asked to pack only for a day.
One day? - Yes.
Greetings, Her Highness.
What brings you here?
I'm counting the trees in this area.
My car's broken down, give it a push.
Come on.
Something doesn't feel right.
Is Saheb planning the wedding?
I don't know,
just keep your phone on.
Hello. Hello...
Hello.
Jagdish, we've guests. - Yes.
Show her to her room...
and tell her we'll
meet over breakfast.
Yes.
Take me in your arms...
this beautiful moment
might not come again.
Maybe we won't meet
again in this lifetime.
Take me in your arms...
lnder.
I'm fortunate to get these moments.
Take a good look...
lnder.
What are you doing here?
You...
I came to see you.
We couldn't meet this morning.
So, I thought that
maybe you're angry...
You... came all the way here!
Maybe we won't meet
again in this lifetime.
Where? - Inside?
Take me in your arms...
I thought you might be angry,
so I must apologies.
Take it off.
What?
You're here to apologies,
so you'll have to bow down.
I called you in a hurry.
I apologies.
It was no trouble coming here.
It's just that I
didn't know why, so...
Your eyes convey that
I troubled you a lot.
This...
A gift for you.
This cannot make up
for the mistakes I made...
. but, I called you
here to say that...
I'm breaking this engagement.
You cannot always do as you please.
You cannot break this engagement
as and when you please.
Since I made this mistake,
everything's going wrong.
And, I am responsible for it?
It's in the air here.
Every good thing gets spoilt.
There's a conspiracy
behind every relation.
I don't want you to
be just a lifeless image.
I... have stolen many glances of you.
What?
Hello. - I want to talk to you.
But, can't do it over the phone.
Shall I come over, or will you?
I am coming.
I... I want to tell you something.
You have many enemies, Saheb.
Why are you telling me this?
Your pictures made me turn a traitor.
You were right.
There's something in the air here...
that spoils every good thing.
Every corner... of my heart echoed.
The moon smiled from the clouds.
I was betrayed.
How far have I come?
Now, I need to stop.
And fill the void.
Every corner of my heart echoed.
The moon smiled from the clouds.
Why do dreams make me smile?
Even the nights look pleasant.
WOW!
Ranjana.
How are you?
All fine.
Why are you answering in-short?
Anyone around? - Yes.
I see.
Listen.
Don't worry, Ranjana.
Just a few more days,
and then its all over.
Bye.
Bye, darling.
What? - Come on!
Come on, smile now.
One smile.
This day will be recorded in history.
These four independent MLAs'...
who were against the division
of the state are now in favor of it.
And, they've also
joined the CM's party.
Madhvi Singh's is in
direct collision course...
with her husband,
Aditya Pratap Singh.
And all these
developments indicate...
that the division
of the states is certain.
The question is,
why isn't there any development.
The reason behind it isn't
just corrupt politicians.
Population.
Just like the vast population
is a issue for the country...
similarly one state cannot
cater to this huge populace.
Far sightedness.
One needs far sightedness
to do this task.
This state can develop only when...
four new states are born.
Vande Mataram!
Vande Mataram!
And, these four MLAs
have proven my point.
Sunder.
Jagdish.
Sunder.
Her determination, hard work...
is appreciated by our government.
Sunder.
Don't be scared. I'll help you.
Where do you want to go?
You took the gun out.
Did someone scare you?
I took the gun out long ago,
but you just saw it.
Have we met before?
No.
But I know you.
I... am lndrajeet Singh.
You shouldn't have
approached me from the back.
Firstly, I'm wounded.
And my enemies have always
attacked me from behind.
If I had fired...
A Thakur would've died
at the hands of a Thakur.
Right.
Next time, it will face-to-face.
I know my kin, my family
will be hurt by my decision.
And to save it, I can leave home.
Wow! Wonderful!
Madhvi.
She speaks well.
Yes, she didn't have
this quality before.
And you will see the
effect in a few years.
It's a new development. - What?
Wonder who she's been influenced by.
Who says you can't
make a hole in the sky?
Who says you can't
make a hole in the sky?
Try hurling a stone
with all your might.
Wonderful!
Wonderful, Madhvi.
This is the daily routine.
Rudy. Where is she?
Where's the real deal?
Its coming, Tiwari.
Sit down. Be patient.
Patience?
My eyes are getting sore.
She's coming.
She's here.
Here I come. - Come here.
Shall I tell this to the media...
publicly?

My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.
You were a man. Tall and strong.
Never feared anyone.
Since you became a politician,
you've lost all zest and zeal.
This bed was meant for two,
but now it misses all the action.
It now prays for solace.
The heart desires
those good old days back.
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.
You would hold me so romantically.
You would cajole me each time I was
upset, those were beautiful moments.
Tiwari.
You take me in your
arms and shout slogans.
I don't like that.
Be the minister of my heart.
Don't trouble me anymore.
Don't let those bad
days come back again.
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.
Shall I tell this to the media...

Where are you going?
Come here.
Come on.
Where should I hide?
Caught you.
I want to play too.
I'll give you a chocolate?
Did you say anything else to Saheb?
No. Just praised you.
You don't know Saheb.
He can do anything.
And that Ranjana.
He's very close to Saheb.
Will you do something for me?
- Just name it.
Kill that Ranjana for me.
Will you kill her?
Father, I'm sure it will
be in everyone's interest.
Just talk to him.
Yes.
It's father.
Good morning, Bunny uncle.
I want to apologize.
Yes. Rudy's under pressure as well.
Madhvi's with you too.
I don't like our personal
argument getting public.
I admit my mistake.
I just want to meet once.
Call Akshay and lshaan.
I will call Rudy.
Don't tell Madhvi about this meeting.
I want to surprise her.
I'll call a few journalists.
Why do a good thing
when nobody's watching?
Right?
What's all this?
Seems like the entire market.
What do you want?
Looks like he's prepared
for an entire army.
So, Aditya, what do you want to say?
What do you want?
I want everything to be normal
once the bill's passed tomorrow.
Ranjana...
We'll call-off this engagement.
And throw a big party...
where we'll tell everyone
about our association.
I want to surprise Madhvi as well.
I hope you didn't
tell Madhvi about this.
I... You asked me not to.
So how could I?
We're a man of our words.
Great. Wonderful.
We've always considered
you a family member.
Not just me, all of us.
But you always bullied us.
See. It's karma, Aditya.
And we meant nothing to you.
Come on, come on, guys.
Let's all have a drink.
- Aditya, want some?
Don't drink too much.
You'll fall short of it.
How do you have a phone?
Fine, bolt the windows from outside.
Aditya, how did you
bring the phone inside?
All these things, the juice, water...
all that's for everyone.
What?
It means, you all will have
to stay in this room for a few days.
What?
You must have felt really
happy seeing me apologize.
Pardon me,
but your happiness was short-lived.
Has he lost it?
Have you lost your mind?
Rudy. Don't get too excited.
Excited. What excitement?
Aditya!
Aditya!
I'll have no qualms
about killing you.
I've can stand up now.
And now, I'll bully you more.
Tariq. - Vishnu.
What's happening?
Please be quiet.
Calm down.
Quiet! Quiet!
They're unreachable
since yesterday...
and they had to be at
the assembly, but they are missing.
How can I answer
you without asking them?
It can be a conspiracy.
- Of course it is.
Or, someone's pressurized them.
Pressure?
Who could pressurize them?
They could've been kidnapped too.
What have you done about it?
- Tell us.
Madhvi ma'am...
Madhvi ma'am.
Madhvi ma'am, please wait.
Hey, you blue shirt.
What were you saying?
Sir, the opposition
can be behind this.
The opposition can't be behind this.
All the goons are in his party.
Say that openly. - It's true!
I won't tolerate this misbehavior.
Sir.
The division's been annulled,
will the CM be changed too?
Just a minute.
Jai Hind, sir.
Yes, sir.
Sir, let's wait for a few days.
Look.
I'm no longer the
party's spokesperson.
That means the CM's changed.
We've been deceived!
We've been deceived!
They should've told us they
weren't coming to the assembly.
Is Saheb behind this?
Of course. - No photos.
It's Saheb. - No photos.
We've been deceived!
Why are you stopping us?
You're getting violent these days.
Control yourself.
Now they'll publish nonsense
about you every day.
Take some of this,
and get some sleep.
When I turned to my right
I saw a big fully grown tiger.
I had no idea... - My God.
Hello. - Ranjana.
Yes.
I want to meet you tomorrow,
in any condition.
I've a plan.
Just one blow.
Where? - At my palace.
Okay?
Yes.
Okay.
I love you, my darling.
This was our hall.
We used to have parties here.
This was the biggest
fort in the area.
Now do you understand
why I took so much pride?
The gun Saheb keeps waiving around...
you need to get that.
You've to kill Madhvi.
At night.
At the time she listens to the music.
No one has a gun in the house.
Listen. - Yes.
Saheb and Madhvi's relation
is spoiled, everyone knows that.
No one else will be accused for it.
Saheb will be arrested for murder,
case closed.
Can you do it?
Come. I'll introduce you to someone.
This is my younger brother,
Param. - Hello.
Hey. Who was that?
Back.
Stay here. I'll be right back.
See anyone?
Ranjana, leave now.
Whoever it was, he was sent by Saheb.
He has seen us together.
But, listen.
What will you say to Saheb?
I'll say that I wandered
to this place accidentally...
and you caught me.
And...
Fine, you go.
And, will you handle it? - Yes.
What about the gun? - I will try.
Look, just get the gun.
I will kill her.
I can go to any limits for this war.
Okay.
Brother, we shouldn't
be sitting out in the open.
You never know who might attack us?
That's the reason I'm
sitting out in the open.
I want someone to attack.
Let him.
So I would know who he is.
What are you staring at?
Anything interesting?
Who are you talking to?
You rascal.
Beat him.
Ranjana.
After travelling towards the jungle
for 12 kilometers from Bandnapur...
you'll come across a mud house.
You will find all your answers there.
Hold it. Hold it.
Turn around.
Turn around.
So I heard right about you.
Kanhaiyya never dies.
And he won't die today either.
You wanted to know my chief, right?
So, tell me.
Inderjeet Singh.
My elder brother.
And do you want to know
something about your family?
What?
Your great grandmother
ran away from home.
Then?
She betrayed the one she eloped with.
Then your family decimated
her entire family.
And the one she ran away
with was my great grandfather.
By the way, the women of
your family are really famous.
I heard that your wife was
having an affair with some Bablu...
Let's get out. Quickly.
Is the press around.
Aditya, rascal.
Don't abuse him.
No one will talk about this anymore.
Hello, congratulations.
What do you say, Kanhaiyya?
Was I right to remarry?
All I wish is your
good health, Saheb.
That's all I care about.
Everyone said Kanhaiyya
is Saheb's shadow.
But now, you've to hide from
your own shadow because of me.
That's fine, Saheb.
I never liked the crowd anyway.
Cheers.
Drink.
You...
As soon as I reached there,
that was it...
You were saying...
Param sir was a daring officer.
He would've survived
if he had taken us along.
He asked us not to follow.
And asked us to
surround from the back.
Hello, I wanted a favor.
For the last time.
There was once a king and a queen.
Go inside and tell them.
You can go inside
only over my dead body.
Sir. This man shot my brother dead.
You cannot even touch him,
- Please arrest him.
Look, this is a police case.
If you interfere,
you'll have to pay for it dearly.
What can you do? - What's going on?
Saheb! You will have to come
to the police station with us.
We've an arrest warrant for you.
To hell with your arrest... - Sunder.
Come, Saheb.
Go inside and get the evidence.
Let me talk to the CM.
Hello. - Sir.
Sir.
Here's the revolver, sir.
Hey. No one will take any picture.
Let's go, sir.
Let's go, sir.
Sir, we won't tolerate
violent behavior.
What's happened?
What's going on?
Someone has sent this for you.
We had a seen a dream,
but couldn't fulfill it.
We had to fulfill it together.
And you suddenly
disappeared from the scene.
What happened?
What happened, Ranjana?
I've a personal war.
Mine alone, and I'm ending it.
And I am winning it too.
I can't celebrate my victory.
I will definitely trouble you.
You cannot forget me.
I'll come in your dreams.
Sometimes.
There was once a king, and a queen.
Greetings, madam.
Glory to... - Madhvi Devi!
Today, you've all gathered here...
for Aditya Pratap
Singh's birthday.
And I'm grateful for that.
When will Aditya Pratap
Singh be released?
I wish he was here right now.
Glory to... - Madhvi Devi!
Glory to... - Madhvi Devi!
Glory to... - Madhvi Devi!
Take me in your arms...
this beautiful moment
might not come again.
Madam, you have four more
meetings scheduled for today.
If you want I can confirm with them.
Yes madam.
Conference room is in the left side.

In China, some of the RAW agents are being killed by someone. One of the agents is Harish, who is the best friend of Assistant Commissioner of Police Yashvardhan ""Yash"" Singh. Before being killed, Harish passes an important coded message in a book to Yash, who is still not recovered from the loss of his wife, Maya. After receiving the book, Yash learns of a conspiracy that has been set in motion, targeting only RAW agents, and takes the book and the clues to the RAW headquarters, where the agency understands the legitimacy of the situation and puts Yash in-charge of tracking down the culprit.

Yash is teamed with another RAW agent, Sub Inspector Kamaljeet ""KK"" Kaur. They track down the culprit in the Indian embassy in Budapest. The mastermind of the conspiracy against RAW agents is Shiv Sharma, a nerdy hacker. In Budapest, a cat and mouse chase begins between Shiv and KK-Yash. They come close to nabbing him several times, but he always proves to be a step ahead and manages to escape every time. While digging into Shiv's past for more information, Yash eventually learns from his aide Sawant and RAW chief Anjan Das that Shiv is actually a pseudonym used by the terrorist to mask his real identity as Rudra Pratap Singh, who is the son of a RAW agent Karan Pratap Singh.

Karan had been sacrificed in an operation years ago, and Rudra was left heartbroken after HRD Minister Brijesh Verma branded Karan and several other RAW agents as traitors, which led Rudra's mother to commit suicide. Yash learns that Rudra is now seeking revenge from RAW for betraying Karan and ultimately realizes that his real target is Brijesh. In an assembly in Budapest, Rudra gears up to shoot Brijesh, though KK and Yash reach there in time and kill him before he can do any harm. Before Rudra dies, Yash forces Brijesh to accept his mistakes in front of the media, clearing Karan's name. Rudra dies happily after hearing this. In the aftermath, Maya's spirit appreciates Yash and suggests that KK will be a perfect match for him.",2031,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt5156746.srt","Sir, these attacks are
not just on our agents
in fact, it's an attack on RAW.
Dubey, how many of our
agents are still active in China?
Now, 17.
I'm sure they will be attacked, too.
Sir, if our agents keep dying,
then we'll know about
the Chinese army's movement
only after they completely
enter Arunachal Pradesh.
I know this is a matter
of National Security.
Whoever is doing this,
he's trying to weaken RAW.
But who could do this, and why?
Only he can answer this question,
but we have to find him.
How will we catch him, sir?
<i>I'm getting you five acres</i>
<i>of land in the heart of Mumbai.</i>
<i>You can easily make</i>
<i>1,000 to 1,500 apartments.</i>
That's fine, but what about Manohar?
I will deal with Manohar.
Did you come here to buy an apartment?
No... I've come for you.
You've a court hearing today.
Did you forget?
Are you crazy?
You think you can drag me out
in front of my men?
Really? Without your uniform?
You think I would've spared
you if I was in uniform?
-We'll come later.
-No, no.
Go deal with him.
Wait.
My wife died five years ago.
Since then, I've lost my mind.
I tried really hard to die,
but no-one could kill me.
Maybe today is my lucky day.
There are ten to twelve of you...
and I am only one.
Maybe you can kill me.
I forgot to tell you one thing.
I will die. But I will
take a couple of you with me.
Especially you!
Anyone else?
Where are you going?
Wait! Don't be scared!
Hey! Gotya, kill him!
Shoot him, Gotya! Kill him!
Kill him! You're dead, now!
You're a dead man!
Wait, wait!
-Start the car.
-Let's go.
You son of a bitch.
Come on, start the car.
Do something.
Start the car.
Let's go. Let's go.
What are you doing?
Come on, do something. Move it!
What's going on?
-What's this?
-Oh my God!
Drive! Drive!
What are you doing?
Spare me! Let go of the car!
Let go.
Let go of the car.
Shall we?
<i>Sir, what do you have to say</i>
<i>about the people that died in China?</i>
<i>Look, our Intelligence has found out that</i>
<i>the people who died in China</i>
<i>were involved in criminal activities.</i>
<i>And they died due to an internal conflict.</i>
<i>But they were RAW agents, sir.</i>
<i>The media has sensationalized</i>
<i>this news for no reason.</i>
<i>As you heard,</i>
<i>the government clearly states that</i>
<i>India has no connection</i>
<i>with these incidents.</i>
<i>The people killed in Beijing,</i>
<i>Shanghai and Guangzhou</i>
<i>weren't Indian citizens at all.</i>
<i>China has maintained</i>
<i>silence on these incidents,</i>
<i>so commenting on these incidents</i>
<i>will be difficult right now.</i>
Is it done?
Yes, it's done.
How long will this continue?
As long as people like
Niranjan are running free.
Which means forever.
I'm a policeman.
If I don't do something, then who will?
Why? Aren't there other policemen?
Is it your responsibility
to bring all criminals to justice?
<i>One day this heart</i>
<i>Will stop beating</i>
<i>Be with me until then</i>
<i>No matter how long this night is</i>
<i>No matter how long this night is</i>
<i>I will be yours forever</i>
<i>Just give an indication</i>
<i>Where do I go without you?</i>
<i>Try to understand</i>
<i>I will tightly embrace your shadow</i>
<i>Just give an indication</i>
<i>You are watching </i>ABP News.
Mr. Yashwardhan Singh, courier for you.
<i>A newspaper in China</i>
<i>has confirmed that</i>
<i>the people killed in Beijing, Shanghai</i>
<i>and Guangzhou were Indian citizens.</i>
<i>This incident will definitely affect</i>
<i>the relationship between India and China.</i>
<i>One thing is clear. RAW agents</i>
<i>will never be known for their work</i>
<i>even if they sacrifice</i>
<i>their life for the country.</i>
<i>RAW agency functions in complete secrecy,</i>
<i>so it will be very difficult to understand</i>
<i>whether the people</i>
<i>who died were Indian agents.</i>
<i>The question is whether</i>
<i>Harish Chaturvedi, Suraj Rawat</i>
<i>and Arun Gupta died in an accident,</i>
<i>or if there's a mystery behind it.</i>
<i>The CBI is still investigating this case</i>
<i>and we hope to learn more about it soon.</i>
Get up, you drunkard.
Come on.
-Have we arrived?
-We haven't even started yet.
We've been sitting here for 30 minutes.
-I won't drive.
-Why?
And if I do, you would be
the one to arrest me, my cop!
""Cop"".
And what are you?
So, tell me, Mr. Bond,
where are you being posted?
Tell me. What if you die?
The way you beat up the bad guys...
I'm sure that you'll be the first to die.
Yeah.
I'm a cop. If I die,
I will be called a martyr.
If anything happens to you...
then the government will say,
""He wasn't an Indian citizen at all.""
Then you tell them.
You tell everyone
that I am India's best citizen.
Sir, none of them was an accident.
The Chinese agency learned
that they were RAW agents,
and that got them killed.
Someone is definitely
leaking our identity.
But how can a police
officer have this information?
Yash is not an ordinary officer.
You've been called in.
Come.
Please share whatever
information you have with him.
Harish sent this
book to me, not him.
Do you know what this means?
Harish didn't trust RAW.
There are two people in this room
whom I trust the most.
Harish has written
""2012"" in the year 2016.
It's not a mistake. It's a clue.
It's not a date.
It's a page number.
<i>Pages six, eight and twelve.</i>
<i>The first letter on page six is S.</i>
<i>On page eight, it's P.</i>
-And on page 12--
-Y.
We all know there's someone
among us who is a spy for China.
Do you know where he is?
No.
Harish knew.
It takes years to make a spy network.
We must find that man.
Sir, I will find that man.
Let me go to Budapest.
You shouldn't take such complicated
matters personally, Yash.
I'm taking this personally.
That's why I won't turn over.
It's clear that one of your
men is leaking this information.
That is possible.
But please understand, we cannot carry
out such missions on foreign soil.
Times have changed,
and so has the country.
Now, we strike right at the heart.
And you're not trained
for such missions.
Are those who trained alive?
You won't regret sending him there.
Look, Yash, you will go there
with the Eastern European in charge, KK.
They've created quite a network
in the last two years.
Sir. I need your signature on this.
Yash, go and meet KK. I will join you.
<i>Did you counter-check</i>
<i>the information Martinez sent?</i>
Where can I find KK?
Send me the printouts of these, please.
I'm KK. Kamaljeet Kaur.
What was that ""oh""?
Were you expecting a male officer?
Yes.
So, you don't think girls are capable?
All I know is that
KK could be a name of a guy.
By the way, who are you?
We've a lead on the China case.
Someone's leaking the identities
of our agents from the Budapest Embassy.
Yash is a police officer.
You two will go together.
I should be accompanied
by a trained RAW agent.
-Why this police officer?
-Because the lead came through him.
This is Brijesh Verma.
Our HRD Minister.
He began his career
in 1988, as an IS officer.
In 2012, he became the cabinet secretary.
He remained in this post for two years.
And entered politics in 2014.
He contested the election
in Meerut and became an MP.
A year later, the HRD minister.
Sir, this is irrelevant information.
We're wasting our time.
It's essential for you
to know about the HRD Minister.
Because he's going to Budapest
for the Indo-Hungarian summit.
You two will go there,
pretending to look after his security.
That's the RAW's way of doing things.
This is Naren Kaushik,
our ambassador for Hungary.
He will assist you with anything you need.
All the details
of the Budapest Embassy staff are in here.
SIM cards, too.
I'm going to Berlin three days later
for a security conference.
If needed, I'll come to Budapest.
-Sir, who is leading this team?
-You will, of course.
-What is RAW's yearly turnover?
-What?
They take good care of their employees.
I bought the business
class ticket myself.
Then you must have booked
a suite for yourself in the hotel.
With your money.
Only film-stars live in hotels.
We're going to the safe house.
This place is called
a safe-house for a reason.
Because no-one knows we're here.
Anyway, the ambassador
will be here in ten to fifteen minutes.
We need to discuss further plans.
How did you get the address to this place?
The ambassador emailed it to me.
Anything else?
Yash, what are you doing?
Come on.
Have you lost your mind, Yash?
This is not the way--
Your job is done. They are dead.
You knew there was a bomb?
If he can hack the agency's system
and get the agents names,
then he can read
the Ambassador's mail, too.
That's the Mumbai Police's
way of doing things.
-Where now?
-Where the film stars stay.
Yes, but whoever it was
thinks we're dead.
I'll check the footage and records
of all the employees
and zero in on the suspects.
After that, we'll keep
surveillance on him and find him.
Where are you going?
You work your way
and I'll work my way.
I've prepared a list of suspects.
And zeroed in on these three.
We're here to work, not to go pub-hopping.
He's your man.
Not possible.
He has a disciplined routine.
He used to work in Belgium.
Never missed office.
Always punctual. Makes good money, too.
No connection with the Chinese.
No alcohol or cigarettes, either.
No girlfriend. He'd go
straight home from the office.
He's too clean.
These are my three suspects.
There's been a considerable change
in his behavior in the last two months.
For someone who never worked overtime,
what made him so hard-working
that he works overtime every day?
He married this girl three months ago.
She's a resident of Hong Kong.
They didn't meet before,
or even go on a date.
So, why did they suddenly get married?
I suspect him the most.
Before Budapest, he worked for three years
at the Indian Embassy in China.
And he handles the Chinese desk over here.
Like you said, he hacked
our entire system from Budapest.
We'll send a coded email
to the Ambassador from a fake ID
stating that a Chinese embassy official
has agreed to be our agent.
And he's coming to meet us
at the Glasshouse Art Gallery.
And whoever our guy is,
he will definitely decode our email.
And if our suspicion is true,
he will show up.
You are right.
He will definitely come there.
Any time now.
Thank you.
I told you he'd come, Yash.
Ma'am, he's making a call.
Hold on.
He's not making a call,
he's taking pictures.
Yash, I...
I'll ask the questions.
Yes, ma'am.
That's my personal phone.
You can't use it.
-Yash, where are you?
-KK, your plan was good,
but you got the wrong guy.
-Let Amit go.
-What? Why?
The right guy never
went inside the gallery.
Who?
You're wasting your time.
I've already arrested Amit.
Check the CCTV footage.
I'm going to Shiv's house.
-What were you doing in the gallery?
-I...
Someone forwarded me an email
which was sent to the Ambassador.
-And it was written--
-Someone forwarded you the mail?
Yes!
-You, show me the CCTV footage.
-Yes, ma'am.
This is your man.
Hello.
Yash, you were right about Shiv.
-Where are you?
-Behind his building.
-I'm right outside his door.
-He's not inside.
But there is someone inside.
It's you.
I was scared for a moment.
What happened?
Where did he go?
I don't know.
Well, he didn't come downstairs.
That means...
You have another opportunity, today.
You can't shoot?
I definitely can.
Want to see?
You're hiding something from me.
What do you want to say?
I feel that Shiv knows you.
Of course you do.
He's my fiancé, after all.
Why did he say that you can't shoot?
It's hard to believe that
this guy could do something like this.
Where did you recruit him from?
We placed an ad for a consultant.
He had all the necessary qualifications.
He's from Belgium. He speaks
Hungarian and French.
Did you notice anything
suspicious about him?
Not at all.
He's hard-working
and good at what he does.
He used to mind his own business.
I thought it was a big plus.
So, he has no family?
He was only three years old
when his parents passed away.
He grew up in an orphanage in Faridabad.
Later, he went to America
for higher studies on a scholarship.
Anyway, we've spoken
to the Hungarian authorities.
The paperwork's complete, too.
You can take him to India tonight.
Postpone our travel.
I want to interrogate him.
Our orders are that we must
immediately take him to India.
He'll be interrogated there.
If we interrogate him now,
we might save someone's life.
You follow orders. I'm going in.
You forget who is leading the team.
Look, I know Harish was your friend.
But the other agents
had friends and family, too.
This is not a personal fight.
We found nothing.
We found this when we checked his clothes,
but there's nothing in here either.
If you're done ogling at me,
can we get to my clothes?
No, no, no. These are...
These clothes can’t be
your choice, Ms. Kaur.
But yes, often people in uniforms
have bad taste in clothes.
Don't talk about uniforms.
Why?
Why?
Why?
Because I’m a traitor, right?
Let's not argue
over patriotism and treachery.
You will lose.
Are you done? Shall we go?
Wear your clothes.
Or else I will drag you
to India like this.
We've left the embassy.
It will take us almost
an hour to get to the airport.
One hour.
This will be the longest
hour of your life.
We won't get to the airport. Ask me why.
Ask.
Because there is a problem with our team.
What a peculiar team.
A rich brat RAW agent who can't shoot
and a Police Officer
who couldn't save his wife.
How will they save their agents?
You'd better be careful, Ms. Kaur.
Ms. Kaur, anyone who has any kind
of relationship with him ends up dead.
Take Harish, for instance.
That's what he wants.
And as far as relationships are concerned,
Ms. Kaur's were always in a mess.
You know, when she was 18,
her dad was going around
with another 18-year-old girl.
Like this.
She was 18, and so was that girl.
How would Ms. Kaur feel?
Poor thing--
Sir. Sir, please handle her.
Sir, handle her.
I hate violence.
That reminds me. Two more
of your men are going to die.
Shut up. Another word
and you'll regret it.
If you hadn't shut me up, he could've
been saved. This one's on you, ma'am.
There are two bikes.
That's right, there are
two bikes. Go faster!
What are you doing, sir?
One's dead. Can you save the other one?
Unbelievable, one says ""shut up"",
the says ""talk""...
I'm telling you, this team isn't right!
-Tell me.
-Yash! What are you doing?
Where will the next agent be killed?
Yash, pull him inside, now.
Talk!
Thirty minutes. He will die in 30 minutes.
And only you can save him.
Thirty minutes...
-So, he's somewhere in Budapest.
-That's good, that's good.
So what if Ms. Kaur can't shoot?
At least she can use her brain.
Now, use your brain on this.
One angel, four paths.
How will you save your friend?
Take it inside that building.
We'll have to wait here for a while.
KK, there.
Who are you?
We need your help.
I don't have time for 20 questions.
Tell me where they'll kill
the other agent.
Tell me.
They are already scared. Don't!
""One angel, four paths.""
""One angel, four paths""!
We still have ten minutes.
<i>We've only ten minutes to save</i>
<i>the next agent, Yash.</i>
Hurry up, Yash!
We don't have much time.
Where is he?
You're at the right place.
But unfortunately, you're 20 feet above.
Heroes' Square is also a metro station.
He's dead.
Poor guy. He was a nice man.
He use to flirt a bit,
but at the end... he was a man.
Yash, what are you doing?
We want him alive.
We wanted our man alive, not him!
Why?
Our men, our country...
Money?
How much money is enough
to let our own men die?
You think I'm doing this for money?
Then why are you doing this?
What do you want?
You two can't give me what I want.
We've already missed one flight.
We can't miss another.
It must be really hard
to tolerate failure, right?
By now, you two must be accustomed...
to failure.
Two losers, here to catch a winner.
RAW should’ve sent someone more capable.
Here comes the cavalry.
First the apartment, now here.
How do they know where we are?
What? Don't look at me.
You have my phone.
And you guys already checked
all the holes in my body.
How could I tell anyone?
I doubt it's one of you.
Someone's dirty.
Where are you going, Yash?
The tunnel is closed.
I know.
Kudos to you two.
I mean, that was good.
But I'll give you a chance
to be impressed by me.
At the airport.
I mean... there were
so many men on the way,
so I'm sure the entire army's
waiting at the airport.
Who says we're going to the airport?
Where are you taking me?
This helicopter will land
directly on the airport's tarmac.
<i>Another agent of ours</i>
<i>was killed in Malaysia.</i>
<i>Bring Shiv to India</i>
<i>as soon as you can.</i>
Now we'll never know how many
names he gave to the Chinese.
Someone was definitely
telling them about our location.
How else did they know we were
coming here, and not to the airport.
But who could it be?
Something's wrong.
You're thinking too much, Yash.
They tried to save him all day.
-So why did they kill him suddenly?
-It's simple.
When they realized they couldn't stop Shiv
from being taken to India,
they killed him.
Why didn't they kill us?
-Did you check his bullet wound?
-No, why?
Sir, nature is just amazing.
Have you heard about the Medusa Spider?
<i>I hadn't, either.</i>
The venom of this spider
can stop a man's heartbeat for 30 minutes.
But next time, your
heartbeat will stop for good.
I mean, you're such a player.
<i>You even have one-liners for your defeat.</i>
How is Ms. Kaur?
<i>She must be upset.</i>
-Take care of her.
-You think about yourself.
How long do you think
they can protect you?
<i>I mean, you won't give up.</i>
This game's gonna be fun.
Killing six people is a game for you?
I didn't start this game, sir.
But I'll definitely finish it.
By the way, don't forget
to thank Ms. Kaur on my behalf.
<i>None of this would've</i>
<i>been possible without her.</i>
<i>Don't be surprised, sir.</i>
Time is a game-changer.
<i>Check Ms. Kaur's watch</i>
<i>when you've got time.</i>
What's wrong?
What are you doing, Yash?
Anjan, Shiv could be anywhere in Europe.
Catching him is impossible right now.
KK, there was a tracker in your watch.
What exactly happened, that day?
It's you.
I was scared for a moment.
Quietly hand over the laptop
and come with me to the embassy.
""Quietly""?
That's one thing I can't do.
And you are three minutes
and 30 seconds late.
-I just deleted everything.
-Stay there.
Do you want to check?
This is all my fault.
KK, we must order an inquiry on you.
<i>Come back. I'm sending a replacement.</i>
No.
What?
KK won't go back.
KK is a capable officer and I trust her.
But that tracker?
He must have slipped it in
when she was unconscious.
It could've happened to anyone.
We will catch him.
What?
One thing's clear.
He's giving them one name after another.
Surely, the Chinese
are giving him something.
Yes, but what?
-Yes, sir.
-KK, there's been a development.
We've been trying to turn Chinese official
for the past six months.
<i>He'll give us Shiv's location in one hour.</i>
Where are you going? Didn't you hear?
We'll get his location soon.
WhatsApp me when you get it.
<i>You think I'm doing this for money?</i>
<i>Then why are you doing this?</i>
<i>What do you want?</i>
-Where are you, sir?
-In your house.
When did you last clean?
Why do you always by unannounced?
<i>If you'd alerted me in advance,</i>
<i>I would've arranged for tea and snacks.</i>
Do you need something,
or did you call to waste my time?
Sir, do you know
the biggest problem with Indians?
So, you did call to waste my time.
We Indians never do our jobs ourselves.
<i>We keep delegating them.</i>
Look. A poor Chinese man ended up dead
trying to give away my location.
<i>Too bad.</i>
How about some advice? For free?
<i>Stop looking for me.</i>
<i>Marry Ms. Kaur and settle down</i>
<i>in some hill-station.</i>
<i>You two are old enough, now.</i>
Here's my advice for you.
Sell your home...
and get used to living
in a room without windows.
Yes, boss.
<i>-I'm listening, boss.</i>
-I've a job for you.
Yash, where are you?
-That Chinese official...
-He's dead.
What? How?
How would a RAW agent find him now?
Through my Hungarian contact, Martinez.
I'll call Anjan, you talk to Martinez.
Martinez never takes calls. Only texts.
This is the address he gave me.
Where is Martinez?
-You want a martini?
-Where is Martinez?
Virai, where's Martinez?
Looking for Martinez?
Upstairs.
Upstairs.
Where is Martinez?
There's Martinez.
-What do you mean, ""oh""?
-I thought--
You thought it was a man.
So, you don't think girls are capable?
<i>O sweetheart... my eyes</i>
<i>Have been yearning for you</i>
<i>O sweetheart... you weren't here</i>
<i>And I held on to your memories</i>
<i>O sweetheart... my eyes</i>
<i>Have been yearning for you</i>
<i>O sweetheart... you weren't here</i>
<i>And I held on to your memories</i>
<i>How do I explain</i>
<i>The emotions stirring in my heart?</i>
<i>The days and nights are unbearable</i>
<i>I had to tell you</i>
<i>What's in my heart</i>
<i>The days and nights are unbearable</i>
<i>I had to tell you</i>
<i>What's in my heart</i>
<i>So I say this to you,</i>
<i>I love you</i>
<i>I love you</i>
<i>I love you</i>
<i>I love you</i>
<i>As you looked at me,</i>
<i>my heart felt an uproar</i>
<i>Your intoxication</i>
<i>Is slowly growing on me</i>
<i>And stealing my senses</i>
<i>Stealing my senses</i>
<i>The days and nights are unbearable</i>

<i>The days and nights are unbearable</i>
<i>I had to tell you</i>
<i>What's in my heart</i>
<i>So I say this to you,</i>
<i>I love you</i>
<i>I love you</i>
<i>I love you</i>
<i>I love you</i>
She doesn't have a clue
about where she is.
How could she tell us about Shiv?
We need to find someone named
Shiv Sharma.
No problem.
I have a condition. I don't want money.
I want to bang him.
What is she saying?
-She'll help us, but in exchange--
-Just say ""yes"" to whatever she wants.
Finding Shiv is more important.
Yes!
You can bang him.
When?
-She's asking when?
-As soon as she does the job.
As soon as you give us the location.
Tonight.
Something's fishy about her.
She hasn't given us
any wrong information to date.
She'll give us the location tonight.
How do you know?
-She seems to be in a hurry.
-What for?
Ask him to take a shower.
He smells like shit.
What did she say now?
She wants you to take a bath.
Clothes for you.
Why did you do that?
-You want to have sex on this?
-What are you saying?
-I'll take that off--
-What are you doing?
-Don't be shy!
-Go away!
You cheat!
Moron!
I've had enough of you, get lost.
-We had a deal!
-Get lost.
You're a cheat!
Wait!
What's wrong? That was quick.
-So that was her condition?
-Yes. What's wrong?
Didn't anything happen?
Have you lost your mind?
You're a deal-breaker!
Now this will cost you double.
No problem.
-Moron!
-Go away!
Rascal.
Shiv is in Holloko Village.
It's still hot.
He couldn't have gone too far.
He must be somewhere around.
-Yes, Samant.
-Shiv Sharma was in this orphanage,
but he died ten years ago.
Hello?
Hello?
Balraj, talk to the home
minister if you have to.
Yes, Yash?
Sir, that man is not Shiv Sharma.
He might not even be an orphan.
<i>Whoever he is,</i>
<i>he stole Shiv Sharma's identity.</i>
Use all your resources in India.
Start with the orphanage
and find out everything you
can about this imposter in 24 hours.
Mhatre, assemble a team.
Good job.
Are you crazy?
Why did you stay in the village?
Because if they didn't see me
they wouldn't trust you.
Now, they'll trust whatever you tell them.
Smart!
And hitting those men was a good touch.
See you!
Now what do you want?
He got away. We need his next location.
-More money or get out.
-What is she saying this time?
Will she do the job or not?
She will.
Where do you want me to send them?
Send them to Berlin.
What?
I know you don't drink coffee.
Can I ask you something?
Why did you support me
in front of Anjan the other day?
Because I'm crazy.
Completely insane.
In 2013 we received a tip-off...
that a Naxal-terrorist was
hiding in a lodge in Lajpat Nagar.
We arrived at the scene, he ran for it.
I could've shot him,
but that day, I couldn't.
Two days later, he killed five people.
Since that day, I...
Harish and I were childhood friends.
We even went to school
and college together.
In fact, we even joined
the force together.
He would often joke about
how crazy I am.
Complete lunatic.
I thought I'd definitely get killed
and he would investigate my murder.
Neither he nor I ever imagined
that I'd be investigating his murder.
You were right.
His name isn't Shiv.
His real name is Rudra Pratap Singh.
His father, Karan Pratap Singh,
was an undercover agent for RAW in China.
The Chinese Intelligence Agency
found out that he was a RAW agent.
RAW disowned him
on our cabinet secretary's orders.
That's the world of spying.
If you're caught, we don't know you.
<i>Which is why he assumed the name</i>
<i>and identity of his deceased friend.</i>
<i>So that he could take revenge against RAW.</i>
<i>-When did this happen?</i>
-2012.
I'll call you
as soon as I reach to Berlin.
-He isn't trying to take revenge on RAW.
-What?
He killed four of our agents.
If this isn't revenge, then what is it?
It's not that simple.
He wants to use RAW
to get to someone else.
Who?
-Where are you going now?
-To find the answer to your question.
<i>Yes, dad, I'm just</i>
<i>leaving for the airport.</i>
When are you reaching India?
When is your flight?
Son, it seems like
I won't be able to make it.
Please don't say you're tied up with work.
I... I wanted to come to Seattle, instead.
Stroll into your office,
see how you're working.
Later we could've gone for a walk.
We could've had a beer together.
We never had a beer together, did we?
Yes, dad, but why are you saying this now?
Did something happen?
I hid something from you.
No, I hid something from all of you.
What? Dad, I don't understand
what you're saying.
For the last 30 years...
I've been not been working
for some tech company...
but for RAW.
<i>Please come now. Things will</i>
<i>be fine when we meet again.</i>
What do you mean, ""it's too late""?
Why are you saying such things?
<i>Please just come. Everything will be fine.</i>
Look after your mother and sister.
<i>The media has turned this into a farce.</i>
<i>Karan Pratap is not a RAW Agent.</i>
<i>Karan Pratap has no connection</i>
<i>with RAW whatsoever.</i>
<i>But his family claims that he was</i>
<i>working for RAW for the last 30 years.</i>
<i>Look, we even heard</i>
<i>that he was working for China.</i>
<i>He was selling India's secrets to China.</i>
<i>Now, who do we believe?</i>
<i>Are you trying to say</i>
<i>that Karan Pratap was a traitor?</i>
<i>You're all smart people. You know best.</i>
Your father's bank balance
has been transferred in your names.
And the locker, as well.
There isn't much in it.
Just some jewelry.
I guess your father was
too honest, wasn't he?
I met with the Cabinet Secretary.
He said there's nothing that can be done.
I tried to explain that I have two kids.
But he said...
""You'll have to live
with the label of 'traitor'.""
<i>You were right.</i>
His name isn't Shiv.
His real name is Rudra Pratap Singh.
<i>His father, Karan Pratap Singh,</i>
<i>was an undercover agent for RAW in China.</i>
Let's not argue
over patriotism and treachery.
You will lose.
<i>The Chinese Intelligence Agency</i>
<i>found out that he was a RAW agent.</i>
<i>RAW disowned him</i>
<i>on our cabinet secretary's orders.</i>
You think I'm doing this for money?
<i>When did this happen?</i>
2012.
2012!
2012!
This game's gonna be fun.
<i>Killing six people is a game for you?</i>
I didn't start this game, sir.
2012.
<i>In 2012, he became the cabinet secretary.</i>
He contested the election
in Meerut and became an MP.
<i>A year later, the HRD minister.</i>
This is Brijesh Verma.
Our HRD Minister.
He began his career
in 1988, as an IS officer.
<i>Look, even we heard</i>
<i>that he was working for China.</i>
<i>He was selling India's secrets to China.</i>
<i>Now, who do we believe?</i>
Martinez just called. Rudra is in Berlin.
Anjan is arriving there tomorrow.
He's his next target.
Rudra isn't in Berlin. He's right here.
How do you know?
Because he wants to kill
the HRD Minister, Brijesh Verma.
Right here, in Budapest.
So, Rudra chose to be posted in Budapest
because this summit
was planned almost a year ago?
And sending us to Berlin
was one of his plans.
He knew that Anjan was going there.
That means Martinez...
-We must stop this summit, Yash.
-No.
If we stop this summit,
we'll never catch Rudra.
Are you going to let a minister die
just to catch Rudra?
We're going to save him.
We'll shoot him.
What?
The only difference is,
they will shoot to kill...
and we'll shoot to save.
What's the guarantee
that Rudra will be there?
He just will be.
Yash, finding him
there will be impossible.
When the bullets are fired,
only one man in the hall won't run.
Putting a minister's life
at stake like this is wrong.
Ministers should help their country
when in need.
I can't believe that you're
going to shoot the minister.
Not me. You.
Yash, I can't do it.
-We have no other options.
-Why don't you understand?
-I can't shoot.
-You can.
You cannot fail twice.
Thank you, everyone, for coming.
It gives me great pleasure
to welcome the Indian HRD Minister,
Mr. Brijesh Verma, to Hungary.
I'd like to call upon him to open
the first Indo-Hungarian Summit.
You cannot fail twice.
It's no use. I'm gonna kill
this bloody minister.
What nonsense is this? Who is he?
Karan Pratap's son.
-The one you had killed.
-Killed?
Thirty years.
Father dedicated 30 years
of his life to RAW and his country.
But what did he get in return?
He was labeled a traitor.
And died in disgrace.
Every RAW Agent knows
the consequences of being caught.
-Even your father.
-And my mom?
What was my mother's fault?
My mother killed herself because of you.
What he did to your family was wrong.
But you're doing the same thing.
If I have to ruin 100 more families
to get to him, I--
You're forgetting one thing.
I'm holding the gun.
And you're going to jail.
Do you know how many
undercover RAW agents there are
in China and Hong Kong?
Do you?
Seventeen!
And how many names do I know?
All of them.
All the names are up here.
How many are you going to deem traitors?
I will go to jail...
but I will give all the names
to the Chinese, just so I can kill you.
-Seventeen agents will die, unless--
-No!
Sir, they will die--
No more RAW agents will die, now.
I didn't shoot him to save you.
I saved those 17 RAW agents.
-What do you mean?
-Your life is still in danger.
What are you doing?
You must fix everything
that Rudra's mother
and the rest of the RAW
agent's family had to go through.
What do you mean?
I've done my duty, now. You do yours.
Do it, sir.
He's off the rails. He will kill you.
The government has taken
a very important step today.
Those RAW agents who
were deemed as traitors,
their names are being cleared.
Yes.
We ordered an inquiry
which led us to the understanding
that those RAW agents were not traitors.
In addition to clearing their names,
<i>we will also compensate their families.</i>
<i>Karan Pratap Singh, Harish Chaturvedi,</i>
<i>Suraj Rawat, Arshad Khan, Manjeet Singh,</i>
<i>Rahul Rajput, Mahesh Deshpande,</i>
<i>and many more patriots like them</i>
<i>laid down their lives for this country.</i>
Tonight, their families will be lighting
a lamp in their homes in your name.
Well, those RAW agents did their duty
and I'm just doing mine.
Don't forget, you're watching...
You finally learnt how to use your heart
along with your head.
-By the way, she's nice.
-Who?
Who are you talking to?
You're watching <i>The Voice of Truth,</i>
and with us is the HRD Minister,
Brijesh Verma...
No-one.
...who has raised his voice
in support of our RAW Agents.
And his voice is echoing
all over the country.
So, the Minister finally found a way.
Take care of yourself.
And for the first time, our government
hasn't just restored their honor,
but also their identity.
Our country is really changing.
I don't get it.
Why do only good people die?
Why do bad things happen to the good?
Those who should be crying are laughing.
Those who should be laughing are crying.
I've had enough of this.
I've stayed silent for too long.
Now, listen to the uproar in my heart.
Listen to my intentions.
<i>Obsession is my nature</i>
<i>It's stubborn and I am high on it</i>
<i>And only I know where you belong</i>
<i>The game you just played...</i>
<i>You're going to lose</i>
<i>How long are you going to</i>
<i>Throw stones at</i>
<i>Us thinking we're glass</i>
<i>It's boiling in every vein</i>
<i>Listen up, it's saying...</i>
<i>It's going insane...</i>
<i>The color red... red</i>
<i>The color red... red</i>
<i>The color red... red</i>
<i>The color red... red</i>
<i>The color red... red</i>
<i>The color red... red</i>
<i>The color red... red</i>
<i>The color red... red</i>
<i>The color red... red</i>
The country has changed.
Everything has changed.
If you slap us once...
we'll slap back 1,000 times.
If you try to intimidate us,
we will rip you apart.
We promise you, our force promises you.
<i>Every bullet in my gun</i>
<i>Has your name on it</i>
<i>We won't miss our aim this time</i>
<i>We're determined</i>
<i>We never bow, nor</i>
<i>Can we ever betray</i>
<i>We will blow you away</i>
<i>We are ready</i>
<i>It's boiling in every vein</i>
<i>Listen up, it's saying...</i>
<i>It's going insane...</i>

Force is a persistent feeling.
It's an emotion. It's an obsession.
It's our pride.
Force is a retaliation.
It's insanity.
It's martyrdom. It's a craze.
Force is a voice.
It's your voice. It's my voice.
It's our voice.
If we all scream together...
the world will have to listen.

Kuku.. - Yes, papa?
When are you getting your results?
It will take another day or two. - Why?
Papers are getting checked in Chennai.
Chennai!
They are hard markers.
But mom, I had prepared so well for them.
It's hard marking.
That's why you scored such marks.
Then everyone must've scored similarly.
Of course! Will I lie to you?
Come with me. Stop crying and drink some water. Come on.
Here, Rs. 20.
Rs. 20? It's Rs. 40. - How?
You have two kids.
So? - So, can't you read?
Public student, Rs. 20. Government student, Rs. 10.
Free for failures.
So, one of my sons failed.
Failed? How? How much did he score? - 85.
And this one? - 37.
F-37 means passed.
For me 37 means failed.
How? Give me Rs. 20. - He has failed.
What are you staring at? Let's go.
Give me Rs. 20! - He has failed! Let's go!
Loser! He'll always be a failure! Nonsense!

He is always worried.

He cooks for his younger sister. He looks after her.
Do you want him to wait in the queue?
Shouldn't he rather go take care of his house?
Think before you speak.
Okay. Fine. - Show the results.
Come with me, Kuku.
Move. What's this commotion? - Come with me.

Mitali. - Yes mom.

Nothing. Let's go.
My cousin too has it. In that he runs like this.
Where's the community centre?
The community centre? - We are new here. We don't know.
What..? - Grandpa says, first rule in business
Never waste time on something that won't give any return.
Let's go.
This is a shoe.
Now tell me what is this? - Sole.
Not a sole. Ordinary shoes have sole.
This contains a shocker.
Big cars have shocker, so that they don't get shock.
So that their outer beauty remains intact.
That's why this too contains a shocker.
So this shoe can never get damaged.
So, should I prepare the bill?
Let me tell you something special about it.
Its' design too is amazing.
Superb!
The air flows in from here and flows out from here itself!
Cross-ventilation. - Exactly!
Check it out!
Uncle, isn't the tick the other way around?
You are look at it in the wrong way. Here, now it is straight.
When you walk wearing this, it will be straight. Right?
Just like an aeroplane.
Great! Let me see.
Are they original?
Tony! - No! He's joking!
What kind of a joke is this?!
You mean, I've a warehouse full of shoes..
And I keep stamping shoes with Nicky logos and selling them stealthily?
No, uncle. Sorry, uncle. - He was joking.
He doesn't know. - It's okay.
How much does it cost?
Rs. 1550, only for you.
How much will you sell it for? - 1550.
Discount?
One rupee. 1549..
So, should I prepare the bill?
Should I buy them? - Buy them.
Prepare the bill. - Wonderful.
God bless you. Tony! - Yes.
There's a Tony here and a Tony there as well.
I'm not talking to you.
You've started lying a lot.
Why did I lie to you?
Don't you work in a sari shop?
Yes. So what?
It's been months..
You didn't send a sari for me.
I'll send you one soon. - Yeah, right.
Hey, you speak as if I've never sent you anything.
What did you send? Tell me.
Don't you remember the mobile phone? Didn't I send it to you?
That mobile phone? It's useless. - Why?
Your mother.. - What happened to her?
Nothing's wrong with her.
Your mother keeps playing games on it.
She doesn't let me have it.
I'm calling you from a STD booth.
You've not done anything for me. You haven't sent anything for me.
You don't even enquire about my wellbeing.
It won't make any difference to you if I die.
Don't worry. I'll send something for you.
Who is it? - My friends.
Hang up. I'll call you later.
You have time for your friends, but not for me.
How are you Suresh? - Why did you marry me? Tell me.
It's been six months since I last saw you.
Why do you say so? - Why did you marry me?
Listen.. - You don't have time for me.
'Ronnie's grandpa has a Sari Shop in Geeta colony.'
'All the stock lies in the warehouse.'
'And it is delivered to the shop as and when required.'
'But for us, it's our joint.'
'We enjoy our booze here.'
'By booze, I mean fruit beer.'
'A fake beer. But it gives a feeling of being sloshed.'
I'll ask dad to buy me a second-hand bike.
A bike, why?
I saw Mitali today.
I see her everyday. What's new?
I've been going around with her since ages. Got it?
You've been going around on foot where as she is racing ahead..
On bikes with boys.
Dogs! - True!
I'll get them for you.
He's talking to his wife. - Don't worry.
He is blushing.
True love. - Why would I lie to you?
Bottoms up?
Bottoms up!
""I'm sloshed. I'm sloshed. I'm sloshed.""
I'm sloshed.
I'm sloshed. Fruit beer gave me a high, man!

Papa, no matter the subject.

Oh yes, do you have a passport size photograph?
Yes, I have it.
Fine. Go.
Now go.
Damn..
They have impinged the whole street.
Do you bloody own the street!
I rolled down my car's window and said..
""Apologize!""
Hello. - Hi.
Desraj, isn't this the safari suit..
..that you wore for Pintoo's tonsuring ceremony?
It's been 12 years, but it still looks the same.
Father has a sharp eye..
Anything he sees gets imprinted in his brains.
Forever. - All cheer for Desraj!
I'll blow this bomb on the DJ's head! It'll blow up like bang!

Babloo and Pintoo plan to blow a bomb on the DJ's head.
Hemanshu!
Yes, grandpa!
What's going on out there? Go and find out.
Okay Fix it.
Bye. I'll call you back.
Excuse me. Babloo. Pintoo.
What are you doing? Move aside.
There goes the bomb.
The party is on! It's on!
There goes your bomb!
You are not eating anything. This is not right.
Ronnie?
Kuku! I was just about to call you.
What's all this? - Even I didn't know.
Everyone gave me a surprise when I got home.
All of a sudden.. Grandpa.. - What are you wearing?
Don't make fun of it! Grandpa got it for me.
Don't I look dashing in it? Fits perfectly, doesn't it, Chota?
I'm looking handsome, aren't I?
It fits you well. - I know, man.
What's happening? - Yeah. It's a party.
Grandpa has invited freeloaders. He's offering them free cold drinks.
It's nothing. Don't worry. We..
Why are you eavesdropping?
Go and meet Suchi. - Go.
We'll have our party at the warehouse.
We'll drink our brand.. Wait..
Our brand.. Here's 100 bucks. Buy two.. - This..
We'll have fun on Sunday. A party at the warehouse.
Just a second! They won't let me live. Coming!
Go.. - Wait. I'll be back in 10 minutes.
Have dinner before you leave. Don't just leave. Okay?
And don't forget to buy our brand's.. Just a second!
Coming, uncle. Why don't you just kill Ronnie today!
Hello, auntie. Hi. How are you?
How are you, Kuku? - I'm fine. Everything's great.
My baby..
Auntie, Ronnie.. - Where's your father?
He.. - I cannot find him.
Did you have dinner? - Yes, well..
It's okay. I'll pack some cottage cheese and flatbread.
Okay. - Eat and give some to your father.
Okay? - Who is he?
Ronnie's friend. - Hello, auntie.
They don't have a mother.
No, it's okay. You are just like my kids.
Right, Chota?
My son..
Come give me a hug.
Switch it on.
Hey, they have made the announcement.
Let's go. Let's go, son.
Come with me. Look at this!
'Ronnie Matching Centre.'
Ronnie's settled for life.
Not yet. - Why?
They have just inaugurated the shop.
People need to buy, they need to sell, make profit..
Only then will the shop run smoothly.
Who knows whether it will? - How can it not?
Grandpa's 60-year-old sari shop is right next to it.
People, females who go there to buy saris..
Will they leave without buying blouse and petticoat?
Point. - God bless you son.
Surprised? His life is set.
'Kuku and Ronnie. Ronnie and Kuku.'
'What's in a name? Both of them are same-same.'
'But after they grew up, everything has changed.'
Excuse me.. - Yes?
Photo.. Kuku Mathur.
Yeah. Just a minute.
Here, your photos.
Listen.. Your friend, Ronnie, I have his photo with me.
Please give it to him.
'Now the confusion was clearing.'
'Not even 20 Kukus could match-up to a single Ronnie.'
Water! Water! Water!
Water! Water!
You want to submit your form?
You want a form?
Why are you standing in a queue?
Take it from me.

Sir! What's this? My form?
We're closing for the day!
Again?
Excuse me..
The counter closed.. - 100 bucks.
With such marks forget about the state college.
Go for physical education. It will be done.
Done.
Booze!
Ronnie...? - He's not here.
Where is he? - He didn't tell me.
Hey..
What have you got?
Yes, Kuku? - Where are you?
Where are you? - At the warehouse.
You had promised. It's Sunday.
Today is Sunday? - Yes.
I keep my shop closed on Mondays.
We will meet on Monday. You do your own thing.
But you promised..
What ""you promised, you promised!
I told you, I am working. Don't you understand?
I'm not sitting idle like you.
You keep calling me after every two minutes!
Sir..
Why are you leaving?
Drink with me.
You got the booze, I'll get the glasses.
No, I have some work. - What?
""Kuku!""
Ronnie is now a businessman.
Now, what are your plans?
""Kuku!""
College.
Education.. For another 2-4 years.
Then a job.
Just like your father.
Life completely changes.
One doesn't get government jobs these days.
Go for a private company.
Like me.
""Kuku!""
Hey, Kuku..
Now you too are one of us!
Welcome.
Have you lost your mind? - Why?
What are you saying! Get lost.
I don't want to drink with you.
What did I say? - Get lost!
Come on, everyone. Get in a line.
Do you want an invitation? Get in a line!
Six in each line. Make three lines.
You need to run from this pole to that tree.
Okay? You will start running when I blow the whistle.
Hello, ma'am. Welcome. - Hi.
Why are you looking over there? Concentrate on your run.
Get in the line.
Come on, get in the line!
Take your positions.
Get..
Set..
And go!
What are you doing?
What are you looking at?
Sir, the sole came off.
Complete the race.
Useless!
Kuku Mathur, Chaar Minar. - Sir..
You are here for admission? - Sir, he stepped on my shoes..
I don't want arguments. Just answer my question.
You won't get admission. Scram.
I'll get it if you want me to.
What will you get? Have you seen your face in the mirror?
You look awful.
You want admission.
Heed my advice, always leave your house with a coin in your pocket.
Why? - Strong winds keep blowing.
You might fly away.
Sir..
He wants admission. Scram!
Sir.. - I told you to leave.
I wonder what they think before coming here.
Mr. Sharma.. - Yes?
Who's next?
Water! Water! Water!
Water!
Okay. Water! Water!
Water! Have a glass.
What happened?
Nothing. - Tell me.
You didn't get selected?
Then take up a job.
Why are you sulking because you didn't get a selected?
Will you do a job? A job?
500 bucks.
It's just 500 bucks. I'm getting you a job.
You'll have to go to Noida.
Think over it.
Scene 15, Take 2.
Silence.
Mood.
Feel that your friend has ruined you.
I'll narrate from here and you'll read from there.
Camera! Action!
Ajit! My friend.. - Hold it higher.
You betrayed me.
You pretended to be my friend.
And behind my back you had an affair with my wife!
One friend ruined another friend's life!
You pretended to be my friend.
I'll kill you!
Hold it properly! -If there is no troublemaker..
..there shall be no trouble.
Dolly! Wake up, Dolly!
What is it? - I need to test your fidelity.
Ajit was my friend. - Hold it properly.
But now he will have to die..
Because of you.
But.. - And if you refuse, I shall kill you as well.
No, Amit! Don't do that, Amit! Don't say that, Amit!
You've been unfaithful to me. I shall never forgive you.
No, Amit. It's not so!
Hold it like this! Like this!
Action!
Take 48.

""I love you.""
Hold it properly! What are you doing? Sit down!
""Okay. Thank you!
Keep it down! What are you doing?
Don't you know how to do this? What are you doing?
You told me to sit down. - I told you! Shut up!
""Hey girl!""
Very good. - Nice take, I think.
Very good, madam. Excellent.
What are you doing? Can't you hold it properly?
Very good, boys. - Come with me. - Kuku, get an umbrella for me.
What are you doing? Go!
Where are you going! - I wonder where they come from!
Hurry up! - A burden on earth.
Mr. Sharma, look at this poster. I have printed 1 lakh posters.
What is this? - Have a look.
The hero's photo is larger, like always.
If CDs don't sell like hot cakes then tell me!
Half yours and half mine. It's the same. - Shut up.
Rosy ma'am, tea. Thank you.
How is it? - Nice.
What is this?
Don't you know how to make tea?
How much sugar have you added?
One and Half.spoons, as instructed. - One and One forth.
I have One and One forth spoons of sugar in my tea, not One and Half.
Didn't you think it's necessary to ask me?
One and Half... a little less than One and Half and a little more than one. One and One forth. Got it?
But I was told One and Half.. - Stop your nonsense.
Apologise. Apologise to her.
Apologise. There's no harm in that.
Do you need an invitation to apologise?
Sorry. - What ""Sorry""! Get lost!
And listen, clean my Scooty. I need to leave.
Scooty? - Do as she said. Get going. Go.
Do it. It's just a Scooty. Go.
Go. Get going.
Scram. Leave. Go.
What's going on? Is this a joke?
What kind of people have you kept?
I kept him on Mr. Sharma's recommendation.
I don't like him. - Tell me something..
First of all, you place some hearts near my photo.
Highlight my photo if you are increasing its size.
Baby, we will have big hoardings of you during the release.
Big ones. - I have seen your hoardings.
My photo should shine.
The hero will shine. - Stop it.
Movies don't sell because of the hero.
The heroine should be visible.
They have turned me into a laundry boy.
Mr. Sharma..
We'll shoot the next scene in a desert.
The scene goes like this..
From a distance we can see our hero coming, riding a horse..
Kuku. - Yes sir.
Come with me.
Write whatever I am saying.
Our hero is coming, riding a horse..
On his left hand he is holding the horse's rein..
..and on his right, a tambourine.
Mr. Sharma, the same tambourine which Rishi Kapoor used?
The same tambourine. Write same tambourine.
Now, in this shot I reveal the heroine..
And the heroine turns, in high speed.
And right then, strong winds start blowing..
And our hero who is on a horse, his long hair blows in the wind.
Sir, the hero doesn't have long hair.
If they aren't long then ask him to make them long by tomorrow.
This is not fair. Do one thing..
Call for a curly hair wig. He has an option between that or this.
I won't compromise with my shot.
Understood? - Yes, sir.
Our hero jumps off the camel..
But wasn't the hero was on a horse, sir?
So what? Option. Camel's option, horse.
And as soon as the tambourine plays, it starts lightening in the desert.
And it starts raining.
Sir, it doesn't rain in desert.
But the winds can blow. A windstorm can come. Write it down!
Five helicopter fans. Note it down.
Winds will blow, windstorm will come. Whatever we want will happen.
Go, follow him. Hurry up and give this list to him. - Sir..
Just a minute, sir. Sir..
Who is it?
Tea. - Yes, keep it here.
Thank you.
Kuku..
""Kuku!""
How much sugar did you add today?
One and One forth spoons. - One and One forth?
Yes. - Then why are you so scared?
I don't bite.
No, last time you made clean your Scooty because of the sugar. - Yes..
So this time, thinking about what you might make me do..
I added One and One forth spoons of sugar.
So cute, Kuku.
You will clean the Scooty today as well.
You will, won't you?
Look, don't think that I am like other snobbish heroines.
I am surrounded by selfish people.
I am supposed to do it.
I cannot be polite to anyone During the first meeting.
After all it's the question of Rosy's image.
Anyway, now say happy birthday.
Happy birthday. - Thank you, Kuku.
Now tell me, what will you do for me?
Shall we go shopping?
Clean the Scooty then we will go.
Okay?
Listen, what's your plan for tonight?
Tonight? Nothing.
Then listen, I need a Favour from you. - What favour?
I promised my best friend..
..that we both will go on a double date on my birthday.
I know it is senseless, but she is my best friend.
Rosy, what's a double date?
Kuku, you don't know what a double date is?
You are so cute!
Double date. Two couples on a date.
She'll come with her boyfriend and I'll come with mine.
Then, go.
With whom?
Last night I had a break-up with my businessman boyfriend.
Oh shit. How?
He didn't call at midnight to wish me.
Can you imagine! - Very bad.
I kept waiting for his phone call.
So many people called me, I didn't attend any calls.
Not even my parents'.
I kept waiting for his phone call.
I think I waited for 20 minutes.
Finally, I got irritated and called him up at 12 20am..
Can you imagine, that scoundrel was busy on another call!
My call was kept on waiting.
So cheap. Shameless.
You deserve better. You'll find someone better.
Then I will when I will. But what should I do today?
I cannot ditch my best Friend at the last moment.
She will think that I am avoiding giving her a treat.
So now what?
Please, Kuku, please come with me as my businessman boyfriend?
Please. Just for today. - No. I cannot.
We will go for dinner. You will be my businessman boyfriend. - No.
Anyway, look at you. You are so handsome.
You look like a businessman.
She won't doubt it even for a moment.
She knows all my other friends.
Please come with me. Everything will be fine. I promise.
We'll lie. We'll say that you have a textile business.
We will say that and leave. Okay?
No, restaurant. We'll say that I own a restaurant.
Okay? - You can say restaurant.
It's not like saying so will make you own one.
You'll come with me, right? - Yes. Okay.
Pack this.
I'm taking this. My birthday gift. - How much is it worth?
Hey come on, buy it for me.
Come on, Kuku. Nothing can go wrong. I am with you.
Just be confident.
There they are. Hi!
Mitali!
It's my birthday!
Hi!
Thank you.
'I spent 7 years in the same tuition centre..'
'..because she used to stay across it.'
'Today, finally, I was in front of her, face to face.'
'But as her best friend's boyfriend.'
'That too for just one night.'
I'm so happy.
'Kuku Mathur, this was biggest hoodwink of your life.'
'This is what I thought.'
Kuku, you know, Mitali and I are 2 30am friends.
Every night we talk at 2 30am.
I think we haven't missed a single day.
Too much. Kuku is into restaurant business.
It serves delicious food. Tell her.
And look at this. He bought it for me today. My birthday gift.
A heart-shaped ring. - Happy birthday, everyone.
Finally.
Pinkie, a pink cake especially for you.
Happy birthday. Happy birthday. - So sweet. Thank you.
Mitali, I swear you look like the titanic heroine.
Stop that, you meet her everyday.
Meet him. My boyfriend. Kuku.
I was just telling Mitali. He has a nice restaurant.
We will all go there together some day.
Kuku..
Restaurant...?
You know Kuku?
Mitali, Pinkie plays innocence well.
Either he is fooling her or she is making a fool of both of us. - What..?
Anyway, that is your personal matter.
Let me tell you, he is a pauper.
He was in my brother Ronnie's class.
They just cleared high school. He is a cheapskate.
He stealthily drinks fruit beer with my brother's money.
What...? - And a restaurant business?
Restaurant.. He doesn't know the B of business.
His father works at L.T.C. He stays in a flat.
'This wasn't a double date, it was double trouble.'
'I had such a punch line brewing inside..'
'..that it would have stunned all three of them.'
'But it never surfaced.'
Kuku, you are taking things too far now.
I'll slap you for lying to the girls here.
Get lost from here.
He sometimes borrows my brother's clothes.
Whose t-shirt is it? - Mine.
Get lost. - Kuku is that true?
He's such a liar.
Mitali, he lied on my birthday. - It's okay.
It's been going on for three months.
We'll cut your cake. Get a knife. - Forget about the cake.
Let the cake go to hell. I'm not in the mood.
It's okay. - He betrayed me.
Does he pay for my booze?
Mitali too is one of them! ""I don't know the B of business.""
Here's your booze. I don't want it.
Grandpa, that's 110.
What are you saying? It was 110 yesterday.
I just counted. It's 115.
I drink! Damn! Everything belongs to them.
Mitali is his girlfriend.
I told you, the difference between yellow and blue..
Sonu, what's Ronnie's friend doing here so late in the night?
Where's Ronnie? - Not here.
Damn..
I had told you. You can't see properly. You don't understand!
Let it be. It's not my fault.
Hey! Come here!
Come in.
Yes, grandpa? - What work do you have with Ronnie so late in the night?
It's nothing, grandpa. I needed to return something to him.
Ronnie has gone to distribute calendars.
Give it to me. I'll give it to him. - No, it's okay. I'll return it to him.
What's in it? - Nothing.
Beer. It's beer.
No, it's not beer. It's fruit beer.
Check the bags. Come on, we'll just find out..
Let go.. - Let go of it.
Hey, it's beer.
It's fruit beer. Check it properly.
You drink alcohol?
Hey.. - You drink alcohol?
You are trying to spoil our Ronnie?
What are you saying, grandpa? I don't drink.
Ronnie asked me to get them. - You are lying.
Why would Ronnie want them?
You think we are stupid?
One tight slap and the structure of your face will change.
I'll thrash you so hard that you'll forget where you stay.
You'll forget your father's name.
By the way, what's your father's name? Where do you stay?
Grandpa, he is Mathur's son.
The one who has a wretched scooter? Look, it's parked outside.
Mathur? - Yes.
Who Mathur? - The one whose wife died due to electric shock.
The one who stays in a 40-yard house, behind the gutter.
Stop your nonsense.. - The 40-yard house?
Near the gutter. - You should stay within your 40 yards.
Why have you come here?
It's rightly said that the children get spoiled..
.. if they lose their mother.
And such people need an excuse to do illicit deeds.
Don't you have any shame?
Or have you lost of it?
Is this what your parents have taught you?
Why are you blaming my parents?
Stay within your limit.
You are Ronnie's grandpa that's why I am staying quiet.
Otherwise, even I know how to abuse..
Look how he is talking to grandpa!
Kuku, why are you talking to grandpa in such a manner?
Have you lost your mind? - You don't know anything.
They have been accusing me since so long.
Grandpa saw liquor bottles in his hand.
He has been abusing grandpa since then. - Yes.
Look, that's how your friends are. - Ronnie, they have been..
Look down when you speak to me!
Apologise to grandpa. - Why should I apologise?
They have been abusing me, they should apologise.
Just because the Gulatis have opened their second shop..
Everything you will say will be right?
Just because I am a Mathur, I am not rich, I am wrong?
Why are you blabbering nonsense?
Hey.. - Have you lost your mind?
Apologise to grandpa otherwise we'll be done for good.
We'll be done for good? You have changed.
I'll see each one of you. I'll see you as well.
Get lost! - Hey! Watch out!
Don't you dare come here again!
Ronnie! Ronnie!
Ronnie! Ronnie! Ronnie! There's Ronnie everywhere!
I'm fed up of this Ronnie.
In school he used to say don't tell anyone..
We have a sari shop. We'll joke about it.
Now he has become a businessman by selling blouse and petticoat.
Ronnie Matching Centre.
Not Ronnie Matching Centre, you are a mismatch!
Mitali too is one of them.
Everything belongs to the Gulatis.
Tell me if I don't teach these Gulatis a lesson!
What happened, Angry Young Man?
'He's brother Prabhakar.'
'My first cousin from Kanpur.'
'He's always at the right place at the right time.'
Prabhakar..
Hello. - Hi. Come here.
Why are you getting so hyper?
What's your problem? Tell me. I'll help you find a solution.
Have a seat.
I provide solution to the world.
Tell me what happened. Do you have problem with your job?
What happened?
I don't know whether this is a job or a punishment?
I knew it.
Damn, they keep me running Around the whole day.
And that director thinks that he's from Hollywood!
Tell me what's my fault if it doesn't rain in desert?
What should I do if the hero's hair doesn't grow in a day?
Tell me, if the heroine has One and Half spoons of sugar..
..instead of One and One forth in her tea then what harm will it do to her?
And that hero, he thinks he is Bollywood's superstar.
Enough. Enough. Enough. - They have ruined me.
No, don't say that. Enough.
It will all be okay. - I wanted to open a restaurant.
You will open a restaurant. You will.
They tell me to make tea, clean the Scooty.
Everything will be fine.
I'm telling you, in time, everything will be fine.
Forget about all this.
Tell me, who is Ronnie?
'When someone suffers from a stomach-ache..'
'The one in front of him becomes a doctor.'
'I too consider Prabhakar to be my doctor.'
'And I told him everything.'
'You know what conclusion did Prabhakar make out of it?'
So basically, Gulati and sons have taken you for a ride.
Taken me for a ride? - Yes.
This is a very old problem.
I have also suffered because of it.
'I had a childhood friend, Bindu.'
'And I had a childhood sweetheart, Sunaina.'
'I loved her in my dreams and planned a family as well.'
'But my best friend played a cheap trick and stole her away from me.'
Sunaina belonged to him.
Then what happened?
What could've happened?
Whatever that was done was done by Prabhu.
I did it.
Priest, do you want imported liquor?
What do I need to do, Prabhakar?
Evil powers hover over this child.
What?!
There's just one solution for that.
What...? What's the solution?
Just tell us. We are ready to do anything.
Bindu, say something, please.
You will have to change his name.
From now his name will be..
Prabhakar.
My Prabhakar!
Prabhakar, baby, finish the milk.
I love you, Prabhakar.
Prabhakar, wear your knickers.
Why are you roaming around naked?
Prabhakar!
Deenanath Shukla.
Full name.
'And at that very moment, I made Prabhakar my godfather.'
Sulking won't help.
He didn't just insult you, he insulted me as well.
You are my brother.
I swear. I feel humiliated.
If this was Kanpur I would've made Gulatis apologise..
..by threatening them with my knife.
End of the topic.
Brother, I feel like running away from here.
You don't run away.
Elope with his girlfriend.
He doesn't have a girlfriend.
Then his sister.
She's just like a sister to me.
Then I'll elope with her.
What's the big deal?
You get emotional too soon.
Your problem is his business, right?
Do one thing, make the income tax guys raid his shop.
How will that help?
All their stock is in the warehouse.
Then set the warehouse on fire.
Got it?
Are you getting me?
You are not, right?
Then listen to me.
Set the warehouse on fire, burn everything..
..take everything out of there and sell them.
Whatever cash you get from that, with that we'll open your..
Restaurant.
Are you getting me? You are smiling, already.
Restaurant..
Is there any other option?
I am giving you the throne and you want to go on exile.
Let go of my hand. Don't hold it. Let me go.
What you do mean? - What do you mean by what do I mean?
Do I need to explain everything?
Do you want to be a businessman?
I want to.
Do you want to ruin Ronnie?
I want to. - Do you want to open a restaurant?
I want to.
Do you want to place a bigger board than theirs?
I want to be a businessman, ruin Ronnie..
..open a restaurant and have a bigger board!
Very good!
But how will we do this?
When will this happen?
'It will happen. It will happen on Monday.'
Everyone is requested to attend the prayer meeting..
..on Monday at the Monday market.
Everyone is welcome to come.
We need to cajole Goddess with a lot of love and devotion.
Everyone is welcomed to this market.
Hail the Goddess!
Hail the Goddess!
Hail the Goddess!
Say it affectionately.
Hail the Goddess! - Louder!
Hail the Goddess! - Hail the Goddess!
Hail the Goddess! - Hail the Goddess!
Excuse me..
Do you wish to drink imported liquor?
Yes.
He is my cousin. He needed your help.
Come on, Kuku.
Your cousin is my cousin.
Won't one brother help another?
Tell me, how can I help you?
What you need to do this..
You have come from Kanpur today?
No, yesterday. - Yesterday.
Now listen to what you need to do.. - Where in Kanpur do you stay?
Somewhere in north. - In north?
Where? - Do you know your way around Kanpur?
Yes, I've been there a lot. - You have.
Do you remember the Jharkarkati bridge?
Jharkarkati bridge? Yes.
Going below it, take a left towards Anand Vihar.
Yes. - The first house on the right side.
What are you saying? - Yes. Right there.
My kin's in-laws stay there.
I've been there quite often.
That means you are very close.
I'm so happy.
Jhakarkatti.
Are you done?
Yes.
Can we get down to business? It's okay. - Oh yes. I forgot.
The thing is, during the prayer meet..
Everyone in the vicinity will be there. - Yes.
So it's obvious that the Gulati family will also be there. - True.
Where will you be?
I'm always at the warehouse.
At the warehouse. - Yes.
So, you don't need to do anything. - Okay.
We will come there at night. - Okay.
We will knock at the door. Open it for us.
Okay. - We will go inside.
We will load all the stock in there into a truck.
Wonderful.
Then we will again go inside. - Again? - Yes.
We'll set the warehouse on fire.
Is that all? -Yes, that's all.
Then consider it done.
Give me that glass. - Just a minute.
Just a minute.
Shake your head a little. Shake it like this.
We have to set the warehouse on fire.
We have to set the warehouse on fire.
I won't do this. - Hey..
You cannot force me. - Sit down. Listen to me.
You cannot force me. - Sit down.
Sit down. - Sit down.
Fire.. - Just a minute.
A few moments ago you were talking about relationships.
You were addressing me as your brother.
I told you do a small favour and you want to run away!
I am forcing you? - It's not so, brother.
Why is it not so? Listen to me.
I am saying this to you..
..because Vibhishana held the key to Lanka's downfall.
And you are our Vibhishana.
Did Vibhishana do anything because he was greedy?
Did he?
Did he?
He didn't, right? Then?
But he benefited, right?
The warehouse stocks goods worth Rs.15-20 lakhs.
What are you thinking about?
I am addressing you as Vibhishana..
Is your brain filled with filth?
Your brain is filled with filth. Spit it out!
Spit it out! - Yes spit it out.
You must be feeling lighter? - Are you?
Come here.
Look, he has been watching us for so long.
But brother is not calling him.
You are not calling him.
Keep this here.
That's enough. That's enough, brother.
From tonight, we are partners.
Partner? - Partner.
Cheers! - Cheers!
Cheers! - Cheers!

Oh yes. He played Jatayu in the serial, Ramayana.
O.P. Tyagi!
Goddess is about to join us.
Have a look..
You won't get to see such a sight again.

What is it? - A courier.
From where? - Delhi.
Sign here.
What? - Write your name..
Your name!
Here. - No, here?
He sent a sari!
It's beautiful!
It was just here.
She keeps the mobile hanging around her all day long.
Why doesn't she just disappear into it?
Damn the games!
Hey Suresh..
What? - Your wife's calling you.
Hello? - Hello.
Got it? Did you get it?
Did you wear it? Did you?
Will you ever say something or you'll just keep making noises?
You didn't inform me.
I never inform. You know that.
I just do it.
How do you look in it?
What can I say?
You can see it for yourself.
I swear, if I was there..
I wouldn't tell you, I would've just done it.
Hey..
Naughty.
Who's being naughty?
I am married to you. It's not a joke!
You too are just too much!
Hello. Hello?
Hello. - My game..
Over.
Switch that off.
Switch it off.
Get your phone out.
Type a message to Ronnie.
Do it.
My dear friend..
Sorry to hear about the fire at your warehouse.
I am outdoors.
Working, shooting.
Coming back in two days.
Then I'll call you.
Your friend. I love you.
Write it.
Now keep that in your pocket and listen to me very carefully.
Have you planned everything?
Yes, I have planned everything, brother.
You found a cashier?
You got the place? The location? And everything else?
I haven't done all that. - No, you haven't done all that.
I'm feeling scared for you.
Give me the money. I'll invest it.
Okay? You'll get double returns.
And by the time you would've made all your plans.
I have made all the plans.
I'll make you cut the inauguration ribbon.
You are making me emotional.
I'm always ready to cut!
It's just like there's no relief for the chicken or the egg.
Now what does this have to do with the discussion we just had?
Tell me, is it related?
Who's the chicken and who's the egg?
Who? - It's just a phrase.
I know it is a phrase. I am not illiterate!
It was fitting the context.
You have won the contest.
Actually, brother.. - You got a lot of money.
How many more contests do you want to win?
I think it will be very difficult for you.
Now listen to what I am saying. Rather, jot it down.
Your restaurant will get build on its own, with magic.
Just like this. Three, two..
""Fortune is smiling upon us!""
""Fortune is smiling upon us!""
""Fortune is smiling upon us!""
We don't want waiters in our restaurant.
We need waitresses.
Waitresses! - Waitresses!
Excuse me, where's Tikona Park?
What? - Tikona Park.
Tikona Park? - Yes.
I don't know. I am new here. - Come on man!
Grandpa used to say..
Never waste time on something that won't give any return.
He was absolutely right.
You are doing great!
Now you just wait and watch!
'One rides on high confidence when he just becomes a businessman.'
'It was the same with me.'
Hello, aunt. - Hi.
How are you? Can I drop you somewhere?
No, thank you. We don't want to go anywhere.
No, we do. Thank you, son.
Come on, he will drop us. He is a nice boy.
Mummy! What are you doing?!
No, mummy. We don't want to go anywhere.
Get in. He will drop us.
Mummy.. - Take the first left and then..
Take a right from the signal, then a left from the circle.
Third lane from right, the fifth house. I know.
He is so smart. - How do you know?
Seema Didi Tuition centre, bang opposite your house.
I was a student there.
Son, do you work in a vegetable market?
No, mummy. He has a restaurant.
Of course, I do. Aunt, the DDR, the sweet shop next to it..
I renovated the wretched place and.. - Show her the menu card.
It must be here.
Let it be. We don't want to see the menu card.
Come on, mummy!
Look, aunt, we'll anyway go home and cook.
Come to my restaurant. I'll cook you a nice meal.
And I'll prove my point to you as well. Okay?
Son, do you make kidney beans with rice?
What are you doing, mummy?
Of course, aunt. - Let's go.
We'll have lunch and then go home.
""Like a key made for every lock.""
""Like gloves are made for the winter shock.""
""Like biscuit are made for a tea bath.""
""And you are made for me..""
""Like songs are made to be hummed.""
""Like canteens are made to run on credit.""
""Like politicians, to make money.""
""And you are made for me.""
""You..""

""Yes, you are made for me.""
""You..""
""Are made for me.""
""Yes, you are made for me.""
""You and I..""
""For each other..""
""We are made..""
""Yes! Yes! Yes!""
""Yes! Yes! Yes!""
""Yes! Yes! Yes!""
""Yes! Yes! Yes!""
It's nice, but very dry.
Oh really!
You own a restaurant hence you don't like food from elsewhere.
By the way, Kuku, don't you think this name Kuku is a little funny.
Ku-ku-ku-ku-ku-ku.. - Hey!
Doesn't anyone in your family have a funny name?
No. No one in my family has a funny name.
Wonderful. Here I spot two lovebirds!
You guys please..
Hey you wayward bird!
Mitali, you turned out to be very smart.
You were all over Himanshu on a bike just yesterday..
And now you are going for long drives with this Kuku.
You stole my boyfriend because he has a boyfriend?
And you?
You gave her a lift and reeled her in, didn't you?
She has a loose character. A bloody gold-digger.
Rosy.. - What?
Just shut up, okay! - Shut up.
Shut up! When? Why? How? Where?
Why shut up? Why is everyone being shut up here?
Listen up, ""Shut up"" girl. Don't act smart.
The whole vicinity knows everything about you.
Rosy, why are you guys.. - Settle down, wild cat!
Mitali, what do you think this Kuku is?
He used to serve tea at our production house.
He used to hold the Styrofoam.
He used to clean the Scooty.
He used to slouch while walking.
Take this, take that. From here.. - Hey Monkey, get going from here!
Hey Hrithik Roshan, every movie has just one hero.
And I am the hero of this movie.
Got it?
You? A hero?
Have you ever seen your face in the mirror?
Hey! - Shall I tell you his boyfriend's tales?
Boyfriend? - Yes.
We came here to have a cup of coffee.
We don't want to drink coffee.
We don't want to discuss this matter. - Take him away. Leave.
We don't want to discuss this matter.
We are leaving. We are decent people.
Let's go. - Why should we leave? - Take her away.
Why should we leave just because a worthless tea server said something?
Who are you calling a tea server?
Who is he? - Back off! - Let it go.
I'll tell you all the tales about his boyfriend.
What does he think of himself? - Should I tell about your boyfriend?
Say whatever you want! I don't care! - Let's go! - Take her away!
Bloody spot boy! - Haryanvi actor.
And you! You turned out to be gay!
You said those dialogues of heaven's bird in front of me..
Leave! - Did I say anything?
I didn't say anything.
Let's enjoy.
Churanlal.
What?
My paternal uncle's name.
Gimmy uncle..
My maternal uncle.
And do you know what my maternal aunt's name is?
What?
Polly.
Mithu. - What?
My name.
Mithu?
""There's a lot to talk about.""
""This life is meant to be spent with you.""
""A sign is enough to say it all.""
""That you.. are made for me.""
""You..""
""Are made for me.""
""Yes, you are made for me.""
""You..""
""Are made for me.""
""Yes, you are made for me.""
""You and I..""
""For each other..""
""We are made..""
What is this, Kuku!
I've been calling you since the past one month!
You aren't answering my calls. You are disconnecting them.
Talk softly. - It's been a month you've not being coming for work.
You should at least return the company's goods if you have left the job.
My father wasn't keeping well. That's why I couldn't come.
Your father was unwell, but you were fine, right?
Talk softly. I'll give them to you tomorrow.
Please leave. Please. - Okay. I am leaving.
But don't forget it. - I won't.
Son, where have you been going if not at work?
Well..
This is it, papa.
Kuku Kwalti..
Where did you get the money to do all this?
Uncle, you know, as there a queen behind every king..
There's the same story behind every business.
And the title of that story is ""sponsor"".
We have one.
You didn't get me? We got the money.
Then why did you hide it from me?
Who is the sponsor?
I'll introduce him to you.
Hey! - Hi.
George says..
George?
George Bush, the one in America..
Okay. - What does he say?
There are two things in a business.
Capital and return.
But you don't get return from the capital.
You get return from talent.
One day he feed me.
What did he feed me?
Sweets?
Potatoes.
Sweets made out of potatoes.
Sweets made out of potatoes, sir.
Just imagine. He fed me sweets made out of potatoes.
Right then I decided..
I decided that I will invest in this talent.
Thank you very much, sir.
Being a third-person you recognised my son's talent.
Thank you. - It's okay.
I thought that as my son didn't join NASA as a scientist..
..he has failed in the trial of life as well.
Sir, these has been something that has been worrying me these days.
Why? - Our company is getting privatised.
But Kuku..
Sorry, son.
I didn't support you.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
I'm sorry, son. - It's okay, uncle.
It's okay. - It's okay.
I'm sorry, son.
It's okay, uncle.
You are again reading.
I used to score good marks in school. Ask me how.
How? - How?
Ronnie? - Who else?
How are you, bro?!
I'm fine. - You've become a big shot.
You've started such a big restaurant.
You didn't call me.
I was going to call you..
Cool. It's okay. It happens.
I can understand.
Do all the workers work under you?
That's great.
You remember our teacher Kalpana ma'am in the seventh grade? - Yes.
She used to always leave a remark on your report card..
""Kuku Mathur can do better.""
""Kuku Mathur can do better.""
I never understood what it meant.
I understood that today.
You have proven it, bro! Kuku Mathur can actually do better.
What did I do? My grandpa owns a sari shop.
He made me sell blouses.
Gulati Sons became Gulati Sons and Grandsons.
It's great. - What's great in that?
You are the one who is great.
I am proud of you.
It's doing well.
I've brought a gift for you. Unwrap it.
What is it? - Open it. Have a look at it for yourself.
It will bring back fond memories. - Fruit beer?
What else!
Air-conditioned!
It blows cool air! - Just..
Who invested in this business?
My father took a loan. - Great.
You tell me about yourself. How's work?
It's going just fine.
You know that the warehouse caught fire on the night of the prayer meet.
Goods worth Rs. 15 lakhs got burned.
15 lakhs? - Yes.
We are facing a little cash crunch since then.
You were there. - Yes, I was there.
Chota was dressed as the Goddess.
The TV star that plays the role of Jatayu had come.
Forget about it.
I made you sentimental, didn't I? - Yes.
Why are you eating this? - Chutney. Get some chutney!
Chotu! Why didn't you get the chutney?
Why are you taking so long?
Drink it. - Tell me, how's life?
'Time used to fly when we used to drink at the warehouse.'
'But that day when Ronnie came to the restaurant..'
'I just felt that we should consume all the fruit beer quickly..'
'So that Ronnie leaves this place.'
You didn't print calendars?
I was going to but.. - Print them. Has big impact.
Menu card. Shall I take them? I'll distribute them.
Okay - Okay?
It was fun to meet you after so many days.
Kuku Mathur. You do your job. I'll call you tonight.
I'll go and distribute these. Okay.
'I was feeling a little strange that day.'
'I couldn't sleep at night.'
'I stayed back at the restaurant.'
'I got up with a headache.'
'I had warm water.'
'I did yoga.'
'I didn't suffer from constipation either.'
'Yet I was feeling a little strange.'
Kuku.. - Yes.
Is Sunday a holiday for businessmen as well?
I was just enquiring because you didn't go to the restaurant.
I am just getting ready, papa.
Nephew? - Yes?
What's wrong with him?
Forget about him, uncle. I am worried about you.
What's wrong with me, Prabhakar?
You said that your company is getting privatised.
Yes, so?
Look, uncle..
Please don't mind but..
..there's a vast difference between MA, BA and MBA.
It's not so. You can think over it. There's no hurry.
You can think over it.
I meant that you may have to pay dearly because of computerization.
Blessings wish to reach you..
..but there are a lot of obstacles in its path.
Traffic jams, no entry, railway crossing, check posts..
By the time blessings pass through all these, it's exhausted.
It's shattered.
How can blessings meant for you..
..reach you hot and fresh?
What should we do for that?
I have some money.
No, we don't need money.
You paid the entry fee, right?
Then why should you pay every time?
We need your devotion, your dedication, your sacrifice..
That is what we want.
Begin. - Okay.
Any devotee who wishes to ask a question to him can raise his hand.
Calm down.
Me! Me! Me!
Hey, give it to me.
Yes, ma'am?
Hello, sage.
I have two sons.
They have always been fighting since they were kids.
We have split the property.
I sometimes stay with one and sometimes with the other.
I cry a lot.
Do you enjoy eating fried bread with tangy chutney?
What?
Do you? - Sometimes.
Which chutney do you use? The red one or the green one?
The red one with dry ginger in it.
Try using the green chutney this time.
Okay. - And offer green bangles to Goddess.
Okay. - She will bless you.
Praises to the sage!
Praises to the sage!
Me! Me! Me!
You..
Hello, sage.
I keep studying all year around.
But I mess up doing the exams.
My family too has warned me that if I don't clear..
..my exams this year that they will make me sell vegetables.
Do you drink alcohol? - No.
Never. I never even touch it.
A cap full? - Never.
Have friends ever given to you saying it's a cold drink?
No, no, no. Never.
Do you have a liquor shop close to your house?
Yes, a little ahead of my house.
On the left? - No, on the right.
It will be on the right side when you are returning, right?
Yes.
While returning, buy a beer from the liquor shop..
Chilled or room temperature?
Chilled? - Okay.
And give offerings to Goddess. - Okay.
Praises to the sage! - Thank you.
Praises to the sage!
Praises to the sage!
Excuse me, let go of it for a second.
One question! Just one question!
Calm down! Silence!
What do you want?
Blessings!
What kind of blessings do you want?
Hot and.. - Fresh!
Hot and.. - Fresh!
Hot and.. - Fresh!
Praise the Lord! - Praise the Lord!
Praises to the sage!
You can add him on Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp.
I, too, want to meet him.
Rs. 500 for a private session. Any time, any where.
Do you understand what faith is?
Belief?
When a person's faith in a statue decreases he comes to me.
And put the same faith back in something else and return it to him.
Faith.
Look..
Faith.
My faith in you.
Your faith in me.
But how will I know that my faith has been restored?
A signal.
A sign.
A lighting..
Or a sound.
And you will believe that there's faith.
Enlightenment.
What did you just say?
Enlightenment.
What an amazing thought!
What an amazing thought indeed!
My soul spoke! Amazing! - Look! I've got goosebumps.
I've got goosebumps. - Yes. But when will I get enlightenment?
You will, you fool.
Today it was my turn. Soon it will be yours.
Enlightenment.
Her blessings will always be with you. Go.
Greet him. - ""Distances were expunged..""
Sage.. Get up. Get up. - ""And we got close..""
""It's a strange experience.""
You have met him. Now everything will be fine.
""Let me just express my feelings now..""
""This is a strange co-incidence!""
You are seriously so disgraceful!
Just a minute. I'll call you back.
What is it? - Where's Kuku?
Kuku! What happened?
He's not answering his phone.
He's answering all my calls.
Is he ignoring you?
You are not someone who can be ignored.
Hey, I was just saying..
You are such a scoundrel, Prabhakar!
I swear! What are you doing?
I couldn't understand when and how will this enlightenment happen.
Kuku, Chota is crying. - What?
What is it? - You just come home quickly.
Chota! Open the door, Chota!
What happened? - I don't know. She isn't opening the door.
Open the door, Chota.
Chota! - Chota!
Open the door! What's wrong?
She has been crying since the time she returned from school.
She's not telling me what happened. - Chota!
Move away, Mitali.
Chota, please stop crying.
No, brother. Please don't open the door.
Please don't do anything stupid.
Chota. - Tell me what's wrong.
No, I don't want to tell you anything.
Do you remember what mom used to say?
We will solve all our problems together.
I am coming inside. And you will tell me what's wrong. Okay?
What's wrong, Chota? - Chota.
What happened? - I will fail, brother.
Why? You said that all your exams went well.
I leaked the exam papers.
I was well prepared. I had to only study three chapters.
But brother Prabhakar kept saying ""Ask how!""..
""Ask how one can get more marks without studying.""
So I asked.
He took me to Friends Colony.
To the Printing Press.
We leaked the papers from there.
English, maths, science, social..
All the papers were the same.
But then madam came to know about it.
She changed the Sanskrit question paper.
Don't cry.
To me, Prabhakar always looked liked a criminal.
He did this with me as well.
If I wanted I could have topped.
If I wanted, if not a restaurant, I could've opened a food stall.
But I got influenced by Prabhakar and leaked the paper.
And I got influenced by him and set Ronnie's warehouse on fire.
You set Ronnie's warehouse on fire?
What are you saying, Kuku!
I cannot even apologise to Neetu ma'am.
Kuku this..
'A signal.'
'Or a lightening..'
'Lights will switch off and on.'
'Enlightenment.'
Light, truth.
Enlightenment!
Mitali, it's enlightenment!
Mitali, it's enlightenment! - What?
I'm getting enlightened.
This is enlightenment!
The light of truth.
I have realised what mistake I have made.
I will apologise to Ronnie.
I will tell everything to Ronnie.
Don't cry.
Mitali, I will apologise to Ronnie.
I will apologise to him.
Papa?
Did you leave office early today?
I didn't leave early, son. I've left office forever.
What do you mean? - I mean, I took VRS.
Look, I have got millions.
Now I will invest this money in your business.
Why?
Your brother Prabhakar gave me a very good idea.
What's the use of a private job?
I am sorry, papa.
Kuku, it's okay. - I am sorry.
Hey..
My son got emotional.
What's wrong with the lights?
I think the voltage is down.
Maybe you need to understand.
Everyone has reasons, not just one. Do you understand?
Don't you have any shame? - Wait.
You are a criminal!
You made me a thief! - Wait.
What happened, Angry Young Man?
You happened, Prabhakar Shukla! You!
I ruined my best friend because of you.
Chota flunked because of you!
My father lost his job!
Calm down, Mathur. Please let me explain.
What will you explain? What will you explain?
You made me steal and then you stole from me.
You sold goods worth Rs. 15 lakhs and gave me 12 lakhs.
That night when you tore Ronnie matching centre's calendar..
What was going on in your mind?
What difference does that make? - No, no, no.
What was more important at that moment?
What difference does that make? - Friend or business?
Yes?
Business.
So, I tried my best and made you a businessman.
I fulfilled my promise.
Kuku Mathur, I only showed you the path.
These are your deeds.
And it's not as if you have done something big.
It's not like Ronnie's grandpa did a noble deed and made that warehouse.
Every businessman has to use another to become a businessman.
Now tell me what's more important for you?
Business or friend?
Friend. - What did you say?
Friend. - Speak louder. I didn't hear you.
Friend. - That's fantastic, brother!
Go to your friend and give him a hug.
God willing he will forgive you.
Go. Go. Go.
Good luck. Listen..
Blame it to me. I'll handle it. - Okay.
Most welcome.
Go. Run!
Run! Run!
You are.. no you.
What the..
Ask him that shop's address! - He doesn't know.
He is new to the city.
Look at this! This yellow one. - No.
Look at its border.
Rs. 500.. - Rs. 500! We don't have any sari worth Rs. 500!
The cheapest one is worth Rs. 750.
I'll show them to you. - Get them out.
Drink a cold drink for her. - No? - No?
What colour do you want? Tell me at least something.
Check out their gentry and then show them the saris.
Here. Show her this magenta sari. She will like it.
Welcome, madam.
Get a cold drink for her.
We sell all kinds of saris.
For parties, for birthdays and for special prayer meetings.
So, which one do you want?
Suresh. - What kind of a sari is Suresh?
I mean which Suresh do you want?
My Suresh.
That's fine. But where are you from?
Darbhanga.
Darbhanga?
You are Bihari's wife!
She is Bihari's wife! It's okay.
Have a seat. I'll call Bihari! - Wait!
Call Bihari!
Himanshu! - What happened?
This sari is from that lot! - Which lot?
The lot that got burned in the warehouse.
The sari from the lot that got burned in the warehouse?
What is the sari from the lot that got burned..
..in the warehouse doing with you?
How did you get it?
Bihari gave it to you, didn't he?
Bihari gave it to you? Move aside!
You are wearing our sari and smiling!
Go and call Bihari!
Call Bihari! - Bihari!
Hit him!
Why are you hitting him? - Move aside!
He hooked up with my girlfriend using my money!
What are you waiting for? Get the car!
Move aside, Ronnie!
You just wait and watch! We'll turn him into a ghost.
He has locked horns with Gulati's.
Bihari, I'll get back to you as well.
Hey but brother.. - Let's go.
What are they saying? Kuku cannot do this.
He did it.
Aunty! Aunty, where's Ronnie?
Upstairs.
Kuku? What's wrong?
Kuku!
Ronnie.. I'm very sorry, man.
Sorry? Why are you sorry?
Well..
You set our warehouse on fire, didn't you?
Tell me the truth, you set it on fire, didn't you?
Yes, but..
Don't you have any shame?
If you needed money you should've come to me.
Thief. Why have you come here?
Grandpa and Himanshu have gone to thrash you.
You have come here to save yourself. You are doing this drama.
What are you saying?
I didn't come here fearing anyone.
I came here on my own. I was enlightened.
Damn the enlightenment. Get lost from here.
He was enlightened.
Chota flunked in her exams.
She told me how Prabhakar made her leak the papers..
She flunked.
How my father lost his job because of Prabhakar.
And I ruined my brother's life.
That's when I was enlightened.
That's when I realised that I made the same mistake.
I set my brother's warehouse of fire and started my restaurant.
I have left my business and came here.
Please forgive me.
Wait a minute. - What are you doing?
Oh damn.
Drive. - Just a minute.
Yes, Ronnie? - Where are you?
We are almost there. We are stuck in a traffic jam.
Don't worry. We won't spare him today.
We'll turn him into a ghost! - You are stuck in traffic jam?
Saw? They are stuck in traffic jam.
I didn't come here out of fear. I was enlightened.
Kuku! That's Kuku's voice. Kuku is in our house!
Kuku is in our house!
What are you waiting for? Drive!
Move aside! - Turn the car around!
Please forgive me.
Please forgive me.
I don't have a mother.
Bunty Rocky come here.
Come on! - Kuku is here!
Monu catch him. Sonu take out the hockey.
'The Gulatis wanted to send me to prison but the sage saved me.'
'But he couldn't save everything.'
'The money papa got from VRS in the morning..'
'We lost in the evening.'
'We lost my restaurant as well.'
'Ronnie couldn't do anything to help.'
'It was my fault.'
'But one thing was given.'
'I was not going to spare brother Prabhakar.'
I won't spare him today!
Prabhakar?
What happened?
It's nothing, uncle. - How did this happen?
Tell me, what are you wearing?
Please tell me.
Wait a second. Who is it?
I am Prabhakar. - Prabha..
Same here. How are you, kid?
And I am..
'What's the solution?'
'From now his name will be..'
'I love you, Prabhakar.'
'Prabhakar's father.'
'Today, after a long time Papa came to our room.'
'We have never seen him behave like this.'
'It felt as if we three were missing mom a lot, today.'
Papa..
I am sorry, papa.
All this happened because of me..
Son.. It's neither your fault nor Chota's.
I, too, got influenced by Prabhakar.
If only I would've believed in you..
I would've given you money for your restaurant.
Dad I made a grave mistake.
I don't know. The sari is so nice.
Look, this is a perfect match.
You won't get a better piece.
This isn't matching either.
It is an orange sari and you are showing me maroon cut-pieces.
So much of my time has been wasted.
I cannot find the right colour.
Chotu, show them to her. - Show them to me, Chotu.
Yes, that one.
You got it. Keep it aside. I'll eat it in some time.
Eat.
Who are these guys?
I don't know.
Himanshu.
Yes? What happened?
Who are these guys? - Insurance guys.
Insurance?
They have come to give the insurance money for the warehouse.
The warehouse was insured?
Then what! Do you think we are crazy?
What's for lunch? - Then why did you take money from Kuku?
Stop chanting Kuku's name!
Don't take his name in front of me! Mummy, reason it with him.
Get this straight. We are Gulatis. He burned our warehouse.
Do you want me to invite him home and feed him?
Don't we deserve to get even that much?
Forget the food give him some sense. He has lost his mind.
Even God would've forgiven that motherless child.
Everyone knows that he didn't come to us fearing anyone.
He came on his own, to apologise.
Ruining all his hard work. To rectify his mistake.
But why would you forgive him?
After all you are a Gulati.
Eat your lunch.
It's not matching at all. Show it to me. It's not matching.
I don't know. I have been to so many shops.
What's happening, Ronnie?
Aren't you getting any stock?
You know I need to go for a wedding the day after tomorrow.
I need to get the blouse stitched from the tailor.
When will he stitch it? When will I wear it?
This is a matching centre but nothing is matching.
Tell me something.. - Yes.
Are they your kids? - Of course they are mine!
They don't match!
Damn you to hell! I don't want to buy any blouse!
I don't want to give you any blouse!
Leave! - We are leaving!
First go and check your brains!
Pack all this.
Mitali..
I am sorry.
All this happened and I didn't tell you.
It's okay, Kuku.
Everyone makes mistake.
But it's more important to realise your mistake.
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.
This one.
I'll check it.
Greetings, Mr. Mathur. - Greetings.
Mr. Mathur, we have come from the sanctuary.
Yes. - We have a small post-funeral ceremony.
It is a simple function.
We need to make arrangements for lunch.
You can cook any lentil except for pigeon peas.
Flatbread, a dry vegetable.
You'll be giving complimentary pickle, right?
What is this?
Son, they've come here to give a catering order.
Yes, son.
We have come from the sanctuary.
Mr. Dharshanlal served the sanctuary for 35 years.
He passed away.
We have brought his catering list for his ceremony.
Sorry. We are no longer into this business.
Come in. - You don't do it?
What are you saying?
It is a noble deed, please accept the job.
We don't do catering.
You don't do catering? Then what do you do?
I know everything.
It's all because of the money. - Yes, it's because of money.
This world is going crazy over money. - Come on, papa.
They cannot see anything.
Come on, papa. Come inside.
What are you doing, Kuku? - Oh God!
So what if we no longer have a restaurant?
We can get into catering business.
Opportunity is knocking at our door.
Mitali, please. You don't know.
Come on, papa.
Look, son, your girlfriend is right.
How can we let go of the opportunity of getting into catering business?
I don't want to do it!
But we want to do it!
Enough! Enough! Enough!
Goodbye, Mr. Mathur.
Goodbye.
Your job will be done. - What are you doing?
That restaurant was mine. You cannot use my name.
That's great, son!
You have been using my name since the past 19 years.
Did I ever object to that?
Mathur, the father, was born before the son.
Got it? - And then Ronnie Gulati was born.
Fruit beer?
I know why you are here.
Tell grandpa I'll anyhow repay the balance in4-5 months.
Don't worry.
Have you lost your mind, Kuku?
You think I am here for the money?
There is a vast difference between me and Himanshu.
I had come here to give this to you.
What's this?
Kuku and Ronnie Catering services.
I have been working on it since so many days.
And what were you thinking!
I had to face uncle.
When I came to know that grandpa is going to get the insurance money..
And he took uncle's VRS's money..
I too got that.. Enlightenment.
That grandpa is not always right.
I fought with him and asked for my rightful share.
We have always been together.
So, we will do the business together.
Kuku and Ronnie Catering services.
I am a Gulati.
But I am your friend.
You will fight with your grandfather and help me?
Why?
Because you don't have a mother.

Rustom Deboo (Sharman Joshi), also known as Rusy, is a lower-middle-class Parsi head clerk at the Worli Regional Transport Office in Mumbai. Since his wife died, he resides in a small apartment in the Parsi colony along with his young, school-going son, Kayoze Deboo (Ritvik Sahore), also known as Kayo, and his elderly, grumpy father, Behram Deboo (Boman Irani). Rusy is a completely honest and upright man who teaches his son to emulate him. Kayo has an extreme obsession with cricket with lots of promises, but his father is unable to purchase him enough cricket clothing and equipment because of his meager income. Kayo's school organises a cricket camp in Lord's Cricket Ground, London, which would provide Kayo a chance to play with his role model, Sachin Tendulkar. Rusy decides that his son will attend this camp in spite of the hefty fee of ₹1.5 lakh. The hopeless Behram, who is lamenting the tragedy that changed the game of his life, believes that Kayo just wastes his time in playing cricket and unsuccessfully warns Rusy against sending his son to London. Rusy tries every trick in his book to put the money together, but all his efforts go in vain.

In an attempt to fulfill his son's dream, Rusy reluctantly performs his first act of dishonesty by somehow stealing the gleaming red Ferrari car owned by Sachin Tendulkar just for a couple of hours. The only problem is that the naive Rusy does not inform the legendary owner of the car about it. A wild, breathless, bumpy ride begins that leads to a menagerie of amazing characters: a marriage planner who will stop at nothing; a greedy politician and his reckless son; a Laurel-and-Hardyesque pair of loyal attendants; and a mechanic who specialises in stolen cars. As the Ferrari zooms through this chaotic world of street thugs and collective marriages, another saga unfolds – Behram and his secret injuries and an epic rivalry that goes back 38 years. Rusy must dodge bullets and bouncers for one unforgettable night and play the role of a perfect father. Can he do it? Ferrari Ki Sawaari is a fun-filled story of small guys and their big dreams and how these dreams turn into a mad comedy of errors. Fasten your seatbelts. The joy ride awaits.",2219,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt2122340.srt","Life is a bouquet of oranges,

Plump with sweetness
Each week passes

Each day dawns like

Woven with threads of such joy

its scent carried by the breeze
its melody whistled by the wind
In the white midday sun,
a golden spot of sunset
No time for gloom,

Pockets full of small gestures

No shroud of worry

Woven with threads of this spirit
Sparkles a story

Whispering a new-old song...
In a blink and a sigh, I'm gone
Celebrate each moment,
together; hereon
Woven with threads of
our togetherness
Sparkles a story
its scent carried by the breeze
Well fielded, Kayoze
They say Catches win Matches
And Kayo's catch has certainly
turned the game around
Move
Not out, sir
My foot was on the line, sir
Sir, when I took the catch...
my foot was on the boundary line
C'mon guys, chin up
Papa, you know how well
I played today?
I took 7 wickets
You're listening, Papa?
- Listening, Kayo
The ball was high but far
Iran real fast to the ball...
and I dived
Fantastic
- And catch
Papa, that was a red light
Oh no
Sorry son

Do you see a traffic cop?
No Papa, no one
How could you, Rusy...
I'm sorry
Bhau Waghmare'...
What sort of name is that?
Good morning, sir
Yes?
Sir, I ran a red light.
May I pay the fine please?
You didn't pay the
traffic cop there?
There wasn't anyone there
So who stopped you?
No one stopped me
You say you ran a red light
No cop there
So you should have left.
No big deal
No one saw you
Someone saw me
Who saw you?
My son saw me
He will learn from what I do
I ran a red light,
I must pay the fine
Bylaw, I can't take your fine
Please leave
Here's another headache
Stop there.
Don't offload that car
C'mon, get the car down
Inspector Mhatre, I told you...
Don't tow any imported car
in this area
It could belong to a politician
This car caused a
2 km long traffic jam
They park wrongly, we suffer
Inspector Mhatre,
please listen to me
One scratch on this car
means a big enquiry
Do you know how
expensive this car is?
Rs. 10.2 million -

Where are those noodles-shoodles?
Ready Papa, almost ready
Grate some cheese over them
Yes Papa
Let's watch some cricket, Grandpa
They're not cricketers,
they're salesmen
They sell soaps and pomades
Ever heard of Don Bradman
selling fragrant hair gel?
Now buzz off, weasel
Always knocking that ball
Papa, Grandpa is so mean
Let it go Kayo, it's ok
If he hates Indian cricketers,
why does he live in India?
What's that, weasel?
Nothing, Papa
Kayo, you don't speak

Go, say sorry

Sorry

Added cheese?

Ginger and garlic?

And Mr. Kayo,
here are your shoodles
Last night I had a dream
I was at Lord's, watching
the Cricket World Cup final
India vs. Pakistan
Last 2 overs, India needs
30 runs to win
At the non-striker end is
Sachin Tendulkar
At the striker's end is...
Guess who, Kayo?
Guess...
Kayo?
Give up?
At the striker's end is
Kayoze Rustom Deboo...
Captain of the Indian Cricket team
Shoab Akhtar bowls at
5600 km/ hour
And Kayo easily flicks him...
That... was a wide ball
Last ball now
6 runs to win
All fielders at boundary
Bowler runs
Kayo lifts his bat up
Crowd chants...
North, South, East, West...
Kayoze is the best
Kayo... Kayo...
Bowler bowls and
Kayo swings his bat
Of all the witless, idiotic...
Kayo
Made the TV into a punching bag
Were you batting or battering?
Kayo... Kayo...'
Need a kick on your butt
I'm sorry, Kayo
There's a match tomorrow.
What do I do?
Sue him in the High Court
Now you'll say -
Look at the brighter side of life
Actually yes, Kayo
What if it had broken
during the match?
Listen, we'll buy
a new bat tomorrow
Remember the bat we'd
put a red mark on?
We'll buy that
But that's for Rs. 2800
So what? I'll get it for you
The match is at 9 am
but the shop opens at 9:30
You play one down, right?
I'll get it before your turn
Are you sure?
Sure
One moment
What're you looking at, Kayo?
- Nothing
Shoes?
- No Papa
Goodnight my angel,
now close your eyes
Goodnight love,
hush those sleepy sighs
Let the moon lull you
into a gentle web of dreams
As the night croons along with me
Goodnight
Excuse me, sir.
Does this shop open at 9130?
That's what it says here
Don't know when it actually opens
Welcome, everyone, to the
Mumbai University Ground...
and the Young
Mumbai Indians Tournament
First ball of the innings
And that's clean bowled.
Great delivery
Next batsman is Kayoze...
their captain and
their best batsman
Sahil, go
Sir?
Go, I said
Captain, what's your batting order?
Sir, I'll go two down
Slow down, you'll trip
A few days back I was
here with my son
We'd put a red mark
on a bat, remember?
Which bat?
There're 2000 bats here.
Where will you look?
Howzzat?
Huge appeal. And the
umpire raises his finger
Go, Kayo
Ball's keeping low, watch it
PTVA score -
27 for 2 wickets
Sir, my bat broke yesterday
So borrow one
But Papa's getting me a new bat
I'll go three down
Nawaz
I told you to keep that bat aside
Which bat? How will I know?
Go look inside
Oh yes, there too
Keep this
- What is it?
Money
Now he'll attempt the impossible
An easy catch
PTVA score -
32 for 3 wickets
That was close
9... 10... 11 Found it?
No, still looking
It's not going to wait around
for so many days
What now?
Yes
Sir, if the next wicket falls
and Papa's still not here...
I'll go to bat
OK
Please hurry
First you tire me,
then you hurry me
I'm sorry
How much for this,
after the discount?
If you give me 100 rupee bills,
then 1500 rupees
If you give me coins like this,
then 1700 rupees
Right. I'll mark it.
Keep it aside
Next ball
He tried to step out and play...
and he's out
Brilliant stumping
Shut your mouth
- The over ends
Manmeet, bat
Sure?
Kayo... Kayo...
Finally on field is
Kayoze Rustom Deboo
Score is 70 for 6 wickets.
Just 7 overs left
They need 9 runs per over.
That's a tough one
But if there's Kayo,
there's hope for his team
Next ball
Ajinkya plays it superbly
to leg side
Could be 2 runs
Kayo takes 1 run.
He's running for the 2nd
He's running...
- Sir, 1 minute
He's running...
Still running...
He's just running...
He's running off the field
Quick Papa, please
Sorry I'm late, son
- it's ok, Papa
Yes, this is it.
Bye Papa
Kayo
One moment
Wearing your guard?
- Papa, not here
All the best
- Bye Papa
Here goes...
He's off
Watch now
All set
All wired
C'mon Kayo, hit
All alert
In position
Revved to go...
In to battle
He's hit a 6...
Ana' now a 4
Something zooms up. . .
Look, it's our score!
He's hit a 6...
Ana' now a 4
Something zooms up. . .
Look, it's our score!
The crowds hunger for runs. . .
They gotta have more
More...
And more...
He hits
Watch out
Up and a way
A big hit
PTVA needs 2 runs off the last ball
Last ball.
Kayo played it to leg side
Slight misfield
He's taken 1 run
and runs for the 2nd
There's a throw from the boundary
Kayo needs to hurry
Howzzat?
Alright everyone,
your attention please
Excuse me
Thank you
I'd like to introduce you all
to John McClan...
cricket coach from MCG, London
John and his team are here
to select Under-14 players...
for a cricket camp
The selected players will go to...
Guess where?
To the Mecca of cricket, yes...
Lord's cricket ground, London
So... Over to you, John
Thank you
Now listen carefully
The MCG is conducting a
coaching camp and a tournament...
for Under-14 players
We will select 10 players
from every country
He's upset?
A little
Rusy, this is an extraordinary camp
But it costs Rs.150,000
See, Kayo's the best we have
I don't want him to feel
he's losing a great opportunity
So I'll convince him
he doesn't need this camp
He'll understand
Don't worry, I'll handle him.
I'll just be back
The 11th player is an
international level cricketer
And here's the best part...
This means you could be
facing Shane Warne
Or...
perhaps bowling to...
Sachin Tendulkar
This is important,
so please listen carefully
The final selection is in 2 weeks
If selected, you must pay
the fee the next day
Jeet, forms
Hey
Hello
Good job, Captain
Cheer up
I'll see you at Lord's
Saurabh, especially for you.
Don't forget..
Excuse me, sir
May I have a form, please?
Are you sure?
Yes sir. The form, please
Papa
But Papa, how will we
get the money?
EPF
What is EPF?
Employees Provident Fund.
The Government's piggy bank
Every month, we put a bit of
our salary into it
The Government also puts in
the same amount
And when we need a loan...
like we need one now, for Lord's...
we can take it from the piggy bank
But if we can't unlock
the piggy bank...
do we break it, Papa?
Thank you, Papa
Long live the Government of India
Rusy, I'll sign this...
but I doubt you'll get
your loan in 15 days
Sir, if you recommend...
That won't help
Good morning, Mr. Kadam
Hey Babbu didi
Rusy, how're you? All good?
All good, thank you
Do carry on with your work
Last year, I applied for a loan
for my daughter's wedding
The wedding went off well
Babbu didi was the wedding planner
I still owe her money
Never mind that
Now, when my daughter
had a baby, I got a letter
Glad to sanction you a loan
for your daughter's marriage'
What's this?
Rice pudding for you
Do have some, Rusy
Some tea?
No, I don't feel like it
Something bothering you?
I'm looking for a car
See this picture
Ferrari Italia, 562 horsepower.
Top speed 320 km/ hour
Costs Rs. 34.6 million in Mumbai
Very good car
He knows every detail
That's amazing
You know every detail
Now tell me,
where will I get this car?
No one here has this model
Really? Any similar models?
Sachin Tendulkar has one
Our Tendulkar?
This is great news
Will he rent it to us?
I'll give him any deal he wants
Per km/ per second...
whatever he wants
And I'll return it with a full tank
Babbu didi, life is treating
him great right now
He doesn't need to rent out his cars
Then this sister of yours
is as good as dead
Tell me, why does it have
to be a Ferrari?
Because of my stupidity
Do you know of Tatiya Mandke?
He's a big shot politician
from the Worli village
His son's getting married
- Sir, I'll get back
What's the matter?
Don't like my tragic tale?
Stay and listen. I'm not done
So, Tatiya's son is to be married.
To impress him, I said...
It's your son's wedding
We'll do it Rome style
I was on a roll. I said...
Instead of riding the
traditional solitary horse...
your son will ride 560 horses
at his wedding
Tatiya said - How?
I said - In the Ferrari
The signature red car of Italy,
the Ferrari
560 horsepower
The thug took me seriously
He wants 560 horsepower
at the wedding
And I'm trapped
Hello
Yes, this is Babbu Chanchal...
Proprietor,
Chanchal Wedding Planners
Hello ma'am
Your name's been selected
for a personal loan
Interested, ma'am?
Give your mom a loan,
I don't need one
I need a Ferrari. Have one?
Silly loan peddlers
Since I bought this phone,
I only get loan offers
I'm fed up. Mark my words...
Loan for you'
We'll hear this on the streets soon
Go ahead, laugh at my misery
Truly, this is a big
business deal for me
Please try and get me
a Ferrari. Save my life
Or that goon will shoot me
Opera
It's the music of Rome
At our Pakya's wedding,
everything will be Rome style
Everything. Why?
Because Rome is the Capital of Love
Rani, your prince won't ride
to you on a horse
He'll zip to you in
the Roman car, Ferrari
Every bridegroom has
1 horsepower under his butt
But Pakya will have
560 horsepower under his butt
Great idea, Babbu didi
I have another idea
Babbu didi, no more ideas
The Ferrari's final
Dad, I want the Ferrari
All yours, son
Hit it, guys
The Ferrari £9 coming here
Pakya 's big day is near
What's the number?
- What?
Yes Papa, it's...
Papa, it rang
So answer it
Hello Papa
Hello
Papa, can you hear me?
Dimwit, here I can hear
even without the phone
Go farther away
- Sorry, one moment
Hello... Papa, now?
Still getting your voice directly
Hide elsewhere
Can you hear me
on the phone now?
No, it's the same. Go farther
From here?
Go behind the door
- OK
But Papa, can you hear me
on the phone?
Or can you only hear me directly?
Papa?
Rusy
I have an idea
Go into the bathroom
OK, yes, that's it
Hold on Papa, one moment
What a cartoon character
Hello. This is
Rustom Behram Deboo...
Head Clerk, Transport Office.
Who's speaking please?
Your pop
You bought a phone
to just chit-chat?
No Papa, I heard that
cell phones owners...
get loan offers from banks
What loan?
Papa
I want to send Kayo
to London, Papa
Why?
Papa
MCG cricket camp at Lord's
To send Kayo to London,
you'll take out a loan?
Papa, Kayo's an excellent cricketer
With the right training,
he'll play for India some day
I know Rs. 150,000 is a lot...
Have you lost your mind?
To send Kayo to London,
you'll take out a 150,000 loan?
In no time it'll be 300,000,
then a million
How will you pay it back?
You'll sell this house?
You'll put us on the street?
Don't you dare stuff
his head with trash
Now hang up.
Can't you hear me directly?
Stupid idiot
Papa, Kayo...
Go on, get out
Get him to finish school
Then teach him water-proofing
Mumbai homes are always leaking
You want to take him
to Lord's on that scooter?
Goodnight Pa pa
What is so good
about the night?
Stuff your Goodnight
Can barely find his way
within Mumbai...
and wants to go to Lord's!
Papa, should I speak
to him or will you?
Kayo, you're still awake?
Where're you going?
What're you doing, Kayo?
He's always so rude to you
If Mama was here,
this wouldn't happen
Kayo, I can't fight with Grandpa
And Mama wouldn't have, either
She would've scolded him
- No son, she wouldn't have
Why not?
When I grow up, I'll show him
Let me go, Papa
I'm sorry, Papa
It's ok. Come here
Kayo, many years ago...
there were two friends...
just like you and Sahil
Their passion was also cricket
Like you both, they broke
windows all the time
Both had the same dream...
To play for India some day
At the age of 14,
they played interstate cricket
They made centuries together,
were an unbeatable partnership
Finally, both were called for
the Indian team selection
Rumor had it only one of them
would make it to the team
Oh no... Then?
Then jealousy crept in
On the day of selection,
both played superbly
Every ball was hit for a 4 or 6
It was the drinks break
And one friend
betrayed the friendship
Then?
It was a bouncer.
He couldn't see it clearly
The glass damaged his cornea
He was left with some vision,
but couldn't play cricket again
And the other friend?
He was selected to the Indian team
Became rich and famous,
traveled the world
He never came to meet his friend?
No, never
Who's he, Papa?
Do I know him?
Dharmadhikari
Dilip Dharmadhikari?
The world knows
D. N. Dharmadhikari
But his friend...
was forgotten long ago
Where is he now, Papa?
You're crying, Papa?
He's in our living room
Grandpa?
Kayo?
Was he the best?
He was the bestest
May this mind...
its thoughts and deeds
Every stride and step
Tread the path of Truth
Truth and Integrity . .
Make for a tough path
But remain fearless
and unwavering
Always, with head held high
Stand strong...
On the tough, honest path
Ana' remain fearless
and unwavering
Always, with head held high
...Lord's, London. So, I need a loan
Sorry, not possible
Good morning, ma'am
- Good morning
I'd like to meet
a loan officer, please
He's here
Good morning, sir
My name is Rustom Behram Deboo...
Head Clerk, Transport Office
You didn't call me,
so I've come over
I was going to call you?
I have a new phone, you see.
So?
So I thought you'd call me
with a loan offer
It's ok, sir
Sir, my son,
Kayoze Rustom Deboo...
is an outstanding cricketer
He plays one down and
never returns to the pavilion
He's been selected for
a cricket camp at Lord's
So, sir?
Sir, the camp's a bit expensive,
so I need a loan
Sir, one moment
Sir, see Kayo's certificates
Sir, this is for Man of the Match
This for Highest Scorer
Sir, for fielding too
Sir, see his medals and trophies
This is for Man of the Match
This is for batting... fielding...
One last thing
I want to show you, sir
His medals, sir
Sir, if you see him play...
I'm sure you'll approve the loan
Can I see your
salary slips, please?
Yes, I have them here
Transport Office?
Head Clerk, sir
How much money do you need?
RS. 'I 50,000, Sir
Sorry, you're not eligible
- I know that, sir
You can't get a loan
on this salary
I know that, sir
Sir, that's why...
I've got you his
certificates and trophies
Sir, look at Kayo's talent
OK, how much can I get
with my salary?
135,000?
125,0007
Sir, if a father's salary is low,
can his son never move up?
Please leave
Why would anyone with
a fat salary want a loan?
Only someone who has
less money will come to you
Security
Sir, see his caliber and decide
Come to the club once
and see him bat
Sir, he's wonderful
Sir?
Sir...
Give him this. Tell him to
remember this name
He'll be on TV some day
As he hits a sixer,
all of India will clap for him
And your boss will smack
his head in frustration
Have a good day
Smack his head?
He'll crack his skull
I tell you, Rusy...
he'll suffer so much,
he'll commit suicide
Don't stress. Don't let
this spoil your mood
We'll find another way
Mr. Kadam mentioned that
your father, Behram Deboo...
played interstate cricket
Yes, he was the youngest
interstate player
That's wonderful
Like grandfather, like grandson
Cricket runs in your blood
You didn't give it a shot?
Actually, I...
That's alright. Cricket's loss,
Transport Office's gain
You know, relationships
don't mean anything today
But one bond is still strong -
the bond of cricket
It got me thinking
Your papa can tell Sachin -
There's a family wedding
Give me your Ferrari for 2 days
How will Sachin refuse him?
Papa won't...
OK, imagine this
Sachin asks your papa...
Can I borrow Rusy's scooter
for 2 days?
Your papa will never refuse him
That's the bond of cricket
Yes, but Papa won't...
OK now let me explain
what's in it for you
Come closer
You speak to your papa...
and get me Sachin's Ferrari
for 2 days
In return, I'll give you
Rs. 150,000
A gift, for you
I'm a Government employee.
I can't accept gifts
Ma'am, I've to leave now,
if you don't mind
Sorry, I've to go,
if you don't mind
Our Kayo will go to London, Rusy
Ma'am, what...
Don't worry about it
Go about your business
Listen to me calmly
You know the proverb...
Opportunity knocks your door once'?
Look, once this wedding's over...
you'll lose your chance of
sending Kayo to London
I'm at your door, ringing the bell
Ding dong
But you've locked yourself in
Unlock the door
- Look lady...
Got a problem, Grandpa?
There's a lady here
Go on, now. Do your thing
Open the door, let me in
Take the Opportunity
What do you say?
Well?
Ma'am, give me some time.
I'll talk to Papa
Papa
Sachin's making a century.
Come and see
OK, in a while
Now, Papa
I have some work.
I'II join you, son
Sixer
Bye Papa. See you
Hello?
Wrong number
Hey Mr. Popular
- Yes?
Your social circle's expanding.
Who was it?
Wrong number, Papa
You get dirty jokes or not?
Wrong number, I said
Always been a wrong number
Hello?
Babbu didi,
Sachin knows me very well
Don't you worry, I'll handle it
I will speak to Rusy
I'm his father,
he has to listen to me
And when this is done,
you must visit us
Yes, I'll speak to Rusy right away
See you soon
Rusy, you didn't tell me...
you're getting Rs. 150,000
for Sachin's Ferrari
No Papa, I told Babbu didi...
Listen, don't you want Kayo
to be a cricketer?
Pull up a chair. Sit down
Listen carefully
This is what you must do -
Go to Sachin's house and say...
I am the son of Behram Deboo'
You must understand...
the bond of cricket is stronger
than any other bond
Sachin doesn't drive
that car anyway
It's rotting in his garage
Papa, you're not fooling
with me, are you?
Would I fool with you
on something like this?
What's wrong with you?
My dear Rustom...
Good morning,
Mrs. Sachin Tendulkar
How do I address her?
Good morning, Mrs. Tendulkar
Very good. Continue
You know Tatiya Mandke,
the politician?
His son's getting married
For the wedding,
Tatiya wants his son to be in a...
Ferrari
What a fine idea
He's a very caring father
So I thought we could...
both... help him
You see, you have 3-4 cars
If you can lend one of them...
like the Ferrari...
say the Ferrari...
to Mr. Mandke for a few hours...
he'll pay me Rs. 150,000 for it...
and Kayo can go to Lord's
Any chance, Mrs. Tendulkar?
Very good. Smile
Hello?
Hello Rusy, any luck?
You spoke to Papa?
I have the Ferrari key
in my hand
What? Seriously?
You're a hero
Actually, someone at the house...
probably thought
I was the car cleaner
Gave me all the car keys
I haven't mentioned
the wedding yet
I'll speak about it and call you
Wait, don't
You got the car key
without asking for it
It's a sign from above
Just take the car and come here
What? No ma'am
That would be stealing.
I can't do that
Listen, do as I say
No one will get to know
It's a matter of a few hours
Once the wedding's over,
we'll return the car
I'm sorry ma'am,
I can't do this
Rusy, think of your
son's potential
He'll blossom at Lord's
Sachin played for India
at the age of 16
Your son will play at 12
Youngest player ever
Do your duty as a father
Sir, the latest bestsellers
No, thank you
Hey, nice wheels
No son, step back please
No, don't do that
Babbu didi, where should I
bring the Ferrari?
You did it, my tiger
This is great
Come into the Worli village
You'll see the
wedding festivities
Drive towards them
The Worli village?
OK
The turmeric ceremony
of our beloved Pakya
Stop this
Mr. Mandke
Our Ferrari is coming hers
Pakya, smile if you want
your photo taken
560 horsepower
Our Ferrari is coming hers
What's the matter?
Let the Ferrari turn around
and go back
See what's written about me
in the paper
Public coffers empty,
Tatiya has plenty'
Oh no
Page 5 today,
front page news tomorrow
And that's the end of me
As you know...
there are more politicians
in prison than in power
Now here's my idea
I will tell the Press...
I'm spending money...
but not on my son's wedding
I'm arranging a Mass Wedding
Listen, all of you
Tomorrow, right here...
201 couples will be
married off by me
200 are my social work
1 is my...
homework
My son Prakash
He will wear a number
and pose for photos
Pakya
What's this number scam?
Each couple in a mass
wedding has a number
I will have '201' on me,
and so will my wife
If not, wives can get
switched around
Is that so?
- Yes
So you'll wear a number
and get married?
Yes
Man, you're our Crown Prince
Don't do it
Then Tatiya will be in the
Union Cabinet
I won't wear a number
around my neck
You will wear a number
You will marry the way I want
My friends will laugh at me
They'll mock me -
'Didn't get a Ferrari...
but wore a number plate
at his wedding'
I won't...
Forget this wedding. Cancel it
Cancel it, I don't care
I won't get married your way
But we've started
the turmeric ceremony
How can we cancel now?
Babbu didi, do something
Yes, just a moment, excuse me
Son, listen to me
You want to sit in the Ferrari,
take photos with your pals?
I'll make it happen for you.
Trust me
One moment, excuse me
Can I suggest a win-win
compromise, sir?
There's a ceremony
at the bride's house today
Let's go there in style
The boys can have
their fill of the Ferrari
They'll celebrate,
get their photos taken
In return, tomorrow...
Pakya will wear No. 201
and get married
What do you say?
Well?
Well, son?
One moment
They're kids
Compromise
Take the Ferrari or your dad
will put you on a tricycle
Because you're my father...
I'm ready to compromise
Hit it
Shambhu
Lazy bones... Watching TV?
Where's Shambhu?
Shambhu hasn't come in
He hasn't?
- Nope
So who took the car keys
from me today?
Shambhu has the day off
What's the matter, Mohan?
The car's been stolen
How can that be?
I saw the car leave today
I opened the gate for it
You mean...
you let the thief go?
Don't try to trick me, Mohan
No one steals in broad daylight
The thief took the car
from under your nose
What were you doing?
Watching the match,
eating bananas
Big oaf
When a car enters the gate,
it's my responsibility
I ask...
Where do you want to go?
Whom do you want?
When a car leaves,
it's not my responsibility
I can't ask...
Where are you going?
Why are you going there?
I'll get beaten up
Spare me the details
Explain this to the
Residents' Committee
Not the Committee, please
Because of you, the car's gone
This is now a police matter
- No police, please
I'll lose my status in the village
You'll lose your status
in the village?
So confess that
you aided the theft
But you gave the thief the key
How did the car key
leave the house?
You were alone at home
Boss and his wife are
out of town
The cops will catch you first
Let me explain this to the
Residents' Committee
Wait, please. Don't...
Don't make a big deal
out of it, man
Listen...
Only you and I know
the car's been stolen
Does anyone else know?
- No
We can't go to the cops
or tell anyone about it
Got it?
If we stick together,
we're safe
If not, we're both sunk.
Got it?
Come, let's look for the car now
But Mohan, where do we look?
It's a red Ferrari-
hard to miss
It's here
The Ferrari's here
Babbu didi, I've a task for you
Turn the Ferrari into
a florist's delight
Sir?
Put so many flowers on it...
that one wouldn't know
if it's a Ferrari or...
a bullock cart
My Ferrari
Sir, not so close to the car
Sir, you'll scratch the car
Give me the Ferrari key
- Sir, where is Babbu didi?
Give me the car key
I'm sorry sir,
I can't give you the key
I will drive the car, sir
Sir
Sir, stay back
Sir, please step back
Babbu didi
What chaos
Ma'am
Please don't tell anyone
this is Sachin's car
OK
And only I will drive this car
And ma'am, I have to return
the car in a few hours
Don't worry. You handle it all
Here, put these flowers
on the car
Ferrari
The Ferrari key?
- Later
First clear the area
Your boss played
superbly yesterday
As I was saying,
Shamshu bhai...
I have a small problem.
I need your help
Anytime. I'm here to help
But you didn't keep your word
You'd promised me a photo
with your boss...
I'll get Boss here
You can pose with him
against any car
Seriously?
Sachin Tendulkar
will come here?
Of course. If I tell him that
Shamshu bhai, the garage owner...
is a big fan of his,
he won't refuse
Mohan, you've made my day.
Come on in
This is my friend, Mahavir Tambe
Pleased to meet you
He heads a huge
security guard force
We're here because...
his car's been stolen
A car stolen from the
Head of Security?
Bad days...
Easy, now
What car was it?
Alto
- Scorpio
Alto or Scorpio?
Business as usual, don't worry
Mohan
Both
Both?
Both
You see...
we were driving along
in the Alto
It stalled
To tow it, we called
for a Scorpio
Actually, we were in the
Scorpio, the Alto came...
You're explaining?
No, you go ahead
So, the Alto stalled
We got the Scorpio to tow it
As we were towing it,
he wanted to go
Go?
- Nature's call
We went to the side of the road
The thief sat in the Scorpio
He left in the Scorpio,
dragging the Alto with it
Steal one, get one free
I want to know,
Shamshu bhai...
The Alto, Scorpio and
other stolen cars...
Where do they go?
Scorpios go to
Bihar, U.P. or Nepal
And the Alto?
- The Alto...
Forget the Alto, Shamshu bhai
Mr. Tambe can afford
many such cars
Yes, I can
May I speak now?
I'm just curious...
Can I ask you a question?
Ask away
When a big car is stolen...
say a BMW or a Ferrari...
what happens to it?
Tea
I don't tell anyone this
But I'll tell you
These big cars...
can't be sold openly
Right
So what we do is this...
We dismantle them
and sell them
Boss
Mohan, that's Boss
Dismantle them?
Yes
At Sion village or Worli village
There the car is taken apart
So this is the...
Tire
Goes to Opera House
What did you rip?
Rexin
Goes to Mahalakshmi
The seat
Goes to Mohammad Ali Road
And the steering wheel
comes to me
Right, the steering wheel
Now what's left?
The body
- Right, the body
The body can't be sold
So we take it...
and put it into a furnace
It melts into a...
ball
Have one
- No, thank you
Mr. Tambe?
What's that?
S class
Mercedes
My man stands proud
and commanding
Gave his word
and got me a Ferrari
As the ghetto gapes
and stares
I lap it all up, put on airs
Let me go now
Don't flirt and tease
Let go of me
Release me please
My man stands proud
and commanding
Gave his word
and got me a Ferrari
As the ghetto gapes
and stares
I lap it all up, put on airs
Let me go now
Don't flirt and tease
Let go of me
Release me please
All around they encircle
and .adore me
Slip away now
you won't get a whiff of me
Hundreds like you
dangle in queue
Why should I la y
my gaze on you
All around they encircle
and .adore me
Slip away now
you won't get a whiff of me
You're too naive for
Iove and Desire
Too soft and sweet,
all smoke and no fire
Your performance won't
lure me to you, sir
Take your routine
elsewhere, to another
Let me go now
Don't flirt and tease
Let go of me
Release me please
I Swish like fish,
my cheeks like pear/
Hips lush with youth,
I twist and twirl
Why chase ms,
you Te not my kind
Paws off and
watch your behind
I Swish like fish,
my cheeks like pearl
Hips lush with youth,
I twist and twirl
Meet me later,
I have to rush, dear
It's for my man
I dolled up and came here
He slid this ornament into me
A mirror, quick,
to see the glow he 'll see...
Let me go to him
Let me go please
Have to go now
Need to go now
Let me go now
Don't flirt and tease
Let go of me
Release me please
I'm going now
Let me go now
Let me go to her
Alright Rusy,
here's Rs. 150,000
Before the Press gets here,
take the car away
Thank you
Mohan
How much does a
Ferrari cost?
I'll tell you
If you sell that hole
you call home...
to three people,
over three years...
you still won't get a Ferrari tire
Don't fib
It has just two seats
No seats in the back
A scooter also has two seats
A Ferrari also has two seats
How much extra can
two wheels cost?
4... 5000?
Hello?
Good morning, ma'am
Yes ma'am. OK ma'am
Have a good day
What's the matter, Mohan?
That was Mrs. Tendulkar.
Boss is coming back
I'm off to my village
Wait
Tell the cops
I committed suicide
And my body is in
Shamshu's furnace
Wait, calm down
We have some time.
I have a plan. C'mon
Leave me out of it
Boss is back tomorrow night,
don't worry
Come with me
Mohan
Police
Run
Run!
C'mon, hurry
Mohan, wait for me.
My helmet
Put it on. Use your head
Mohan
Mohan, I can hear
the sound of the Ferrari
You're going mad. Run
Rustom Behram Deboo,
Transport Office
Sir, why's the police
here today?
The Ganesh festival
and Sachin's century...
That's when the police
works overtime
Just a precaution
- OK
Not starting?
It'll start, sir
Listen, try this
Run it down the slope
in neutral
Then slip it into 2nd gear.
It'll start
OK...
Get on the slope
In neutral?
- Yes
Keep it in neutral.
Now put it into 2nd gear
There, it started
Rustom, hold on
Help me with this
Got to nab this red car
Yes sir...
Hello?
Rusy, where are you?
It's morning
Where were you?
Papa, something terrible
has happened
What... You had an accident?
Papa, I stole Sachin's Ferrari
You crazy?
I was fooling with you
Where's the car?
The car's being towed away
Now do as I say.
Come straight home
Wear your helmet
Hide your face from the cops
Something really terrible
happened, Papa
What now?
Papa, I left Rs.150,000
in the car
Kayo can't go to Lord's, Papa
Kayo... Lord's...
Pawar, prepare that report.
I'm leaving
C'mon Jadhav
Jadhav, slow down
Stop, I said
Inspector Mhatre,
what have you brought in?
It's called a car.
Has four wheels...
Sir, this is no car.
It's a celestial chariot
The chariot of my God
It's Sachin Tendulkar's Ferrari
But your God parked
in a No Parking zone
Will my God come
to get his car, sir?
Whether it's your God
or his driver...
don't release the car
without taking the fine
Don't worry, sir.
I'll watch over this car
0 Lord, thank you
There's the Ferrari
Looking good, Pakya
But the Ferrari can't be seen
Where is the Ferrari?
Look for it
Go to the next one
It's covered with flowers
Is it a Ferrari
or a humble taxi?
Pakya, your dad's fooled you
His dad fooled him
How many done, Babbu didi?
180 couples done, 20 to go
20...
You. Come here
Married?
- Yes sir
What was the hurry?
Never mind
Get your wife
and get re-married
But sir...
- If she objects...
tell her you're
renewing your vows
She'll be thrilled.
Run, now
That makes 181 couples
Give me a minute
What's this?
- What's what?
What's this, Babbu didi?
Who told you to use
so many flowers?
Who does that to a Ferrari?
It's a wedding car -
it must have flowers
You're Mr. Mandke's
son, no less
If there were fewer flowers,
people would gossip
They'd call us stingy
They're gossiping now
Saying it's not a Ferrari
under the flowers...
it's an ordinary taxi
People will say anything
You know the truth.
You know it's a Ferrari
Walk the path of truth, son.
It's useful in the long run
You wronged me, Babbu didi
C'mon now...
You committed a fraud
Our deal is off
No compromise
At my wedding tomorrow,
I want the Ferrari
Without flowers on it
Go on, now
Told you to get an abortion
Look at what you produced
What kind of talk is that?
Mom...
What sort of guy did you marry?
If you had asked me,
I would've rejected him
Be quiet
You all go ahead
Pakya...
Don't say anything
Leave, I said
Going
Babbu didi, please handle this
The Press will not see
the Ferrari
That's final
That's my order
Then the Press will not see...
me wearing a number
That's my wish
You can't afford a wish,
you pipsqueak
Dad, no...
Don't mess with me, boy
Sir, couple no. 182
I'll see you at home
What happened?
Scram
I've always told you...
to stay away from cricket
It's made you into a thief now
The Great Gangster
of the Deboo family...
Rustom Behram Deboo
Papa, I have to
send Kayo to Lord's
Why are you so dense?
During recession in the
white man's land...
camps like this are invented
They look for gullible fools
like you, who fall for it
You want to go to prison?
In prison, hold a slate,
get your mug shots taken
Make your family famous
Cricket ruins you, I tell you
There're many dirty games
behind this sport
Answer this...
Who knows cricket best,
you or me?
Papa, I know...
- No, tell me...
who knows cricket best,
you or me?
Papa, I know some cricket too
I played well once
But you didn't let me play
Well, thank me for it
I saved you
Protected you
Papa, don't protect Kayo
Let him live his life
He's a gifted cricketer
He'll make you proud one day
That pint-sized rookie
a cricketer?
He knocks a ball in a sock
in the living room
That won't make him
a cricketer
Papa, you haven't
seen his game
He's captain of his team
In India, millions of kids
play cricket
From the city center,
if you hurl a pebble...
it'll land on a captain's head
Rusy
Remember this...
In a cricket team,
there are only eleven players
What of those who don't
make it to the team?
I'll tell you
They sit on a sofa,
stare at the
use a remote control,
and tuck into peanuts
You may as well put a
Kayo-sized sofa next to mine
Why are you destroying his life?
I'm not destroying his life
I'm helping him make it
You think he'll ever make it
to the top eleven?
No Papa
He's way ahead of the top eleven
No one is even close to him
Not even you
Know who you're talking to?
You're talking to
Behram Ardeshir Deboo
You know who you're talking to?
Papa, you were the bestest?
Bowl as many balls as you want
Just...
try and get him out
Kayo
Papa
Want to play a match?
A match?
Now?
With whom?
Papa?
He's asleep?
Yes Papa
Today's the selection?
Yes Papa
You take Kayo for it
I'll get the money
Where will you get
the money from?
An old friend
He owes me one
I'll call you when
I get the money
You just get Kayo to the ground
You're looking good
Rusy
- Yes Papa?
Give Kayo this tip
Yes?
When...
a bowler bowls...
Go on, Papa.
When a bowler bowls...
No, let him play
the way he does
He'll knock them off their feet
Everyone ready?
- Yes sir
Let's go.
Batsman to my right
Bowlers to my left
I want to meet
Dilip Dharmadhikari
Well?
From my club, at least
one boy should go to Lord's
You want your son to go?
He really wants to go
Do something
You do something
about those TV rights
Consider it done
Then consider this done, too
Gattu Godbole,
his name. RC Club
Gattu Godbole. OK
Excuse me, sir.
Mr. Deboo's here to meet you
Who Deboo?
- Behram Deboo
6th floor
Deboo
After so many years
Please sit down
You've put on some weight
What will you have?
Tea? Coffee?
Beer?
One coffee, please
How many years
has it been, Deboo?
38 years
How time flies
So, to what do I
owe this honor?
38 years back...
I had a friend
We did everything together...
shared all secrets...
checked out pretty girls together
We made thousands of runs
together in record partnerships
Those were the days
Dilip
What you did to me...
After 38 years, you're here
to make me feel guilty?
No
- Is that so?
Not at all
That's not so
I'm ready to forget and forgive
If I do that...
then you're my only friend
Yes
You are my friend, yes?
- Of course
Well?
Dilip
I have a grandson
Deboo, you're a grandfather?
I don't look old enough, I know
He's a cricketer
Of course he is
You know that
cricket camp at Lord's?
He wants to go for that
Well, you see, I must tell you...
the selection is based on merit
And in this position,
I can't favor anyone
Hold it, Dilip
I'm not asking you
to do anything wrong
I'm just clarifying
I understand your position
He's so good,
he will be selected
The problem is the Rs. 150,000
to be paid after that
It's 150,000 yes
So I thought of some options
Can you ask the Board...
for a grant or scholarship?
No, it will not work out
If we do it for one,
we'll have to do it for others
And if the Press gets wind of it...
I know
In this position, actually,
my hands are tied
I understand
What now...
There's another option
As my friend...
can't you loan me Rs. 150,0007
Yeah?
One moment
I'll just be back
Kayoze - Net no. 2
Every gaze is fixed on you
Each heart harbors new hope
The crowds support you
The crowds support you
So do what champions do
With a mighty bat,
make a hefty score
More...
He hits
Up and a way
In the air
A big hit
Thank you
Sir, he won't be back
Why?
I speak from experience
Sir
I'm a big fan
You took eight wickets...
on the dead pitch
of the Matunga Club
I still remember that clearly
Sir, an autograph please
Hello Papa? Any luck?
It'll work out, don't worry
How's our boy playing?
He's knocking them
off their feet
Papa, you went to meet
Dilip Dharmadhikari?
It didn't work out, did it, Papa?
It's ok Papa, we'll find a way
It'll work out, Papa.
Don't worry
Later... I'll call you later
Well played, Kayo
Nice
Sir, I have to leave
on some urgent work
Would you please
drop Kayo home?
Sure, no problem
Shot
Don't worry, I'll drop him
Get away from the car
Don't touch the car
Don't touch the hood
Everyone move back
Stop taking pictures
Who are you?
Rustom Behram Deboo,
Transport Office
So help me out here.
Move everyone away
Sir, I have an idea
There's Sachin
Where?
There
Sir, where are you off to?
To Sachin...
Sir, that was just to distract them
Before they're back,
put barricades here
I'll be back in ten minutes.
I have another idea
Thank you
Sir
Excuse me, sir
Sir, your scooter key
Thank you
- Mention not
Good news, old chap
No Ferrari has come
here for gas
In Mumbai, there are only
five gas stations...
that stock gas for the Ferrari
We've checked all five
This means...
the thief has gas for only 50 km
But 50 km in which direction?
The car may have gone
50 km this way...
while we go 50 km that way
That makes 100 km
Your brain measures
1 centimeter
Don't put a 100 km load on it
C'mon, start your Ferrari
My brain's not working
Give me the helmet
That scooter key looked like
the Ferrari key to me
Don't remind me of the key.
C'mon, hurry
And how much for this?
5000... 3000... 2000...
1500... 1500... 1500...
Rs. 1500...
What model, what size?
Tell me, Your Royal Highness?
Size... It's big
Is it a truck?
You need a large banner
Sorry
Excuse me
Sir
A banner
Banner?
Why a banner?
Lower it carefully
That's great
No one will touch it now
Clear off now
Sir, one moment
BCA?
Bombay Cricket Association?
Sir, I was once President
Of BCA?
No... Our BCA is...
Borivli Cricket Association
A cricket club for our constables
Sir, I'm famous for my
quarter centuries
Sir, you're here for
Sachin Tendulkar's car?
Who's the senior officer here?
Who brought Sachin's car here?
It wasn't me.
It was Inspector Mhatre
Get Inspector Mhatre
Get Mhatre here
Sir, Inspector Mhatre
plays football
He knows nothing of cricket
This is Sachin's car
He didn't know that
The car was in a
No Parking zone, so...
Yes, but how will I know if
the car's with cops or thieves?
It's like this, sir...
When we confiscate a car...
we make a chalk circle there
In it we write the name of
the police station the car is at
If you make a chalk mark...
and thousands walk over it...
won't it get erased?
Yes... But sir,
we have to follow orders
Who's the senior officer here?
Who's your senior?
I'm the senior-most, sir
But don't scold me sir, please
Did I scold you?
Did I get angry?
Did I raise my voice?
- No
Who dares to say
I scolded you?
I want to meet
your senior officer
Sir, take the car
Yes, take the car
I'll handle Inspector Mhatre
No fine, nothing
You must take the fine
- No sir
Sachin will scold me
Please sir,
I don't want anything
OK
But how do I take the car...
Sir, I'll get you a tow truck
It'll drop you where you want
Free of charge
- Totally free
Gautiya... Ashok...
Hello?
Hello Papa, this is Kayo
Yes son?

Thank you, sir
What's wrong with Pakya?
Dad's here.
Give me the number plate
Whoever wants to take
a picture, take it now
Tomorrow's newspaper

Politician's son commits suicide'
Pakya, what are you doing?
Get down
Yes, come down
At the wedding today,
I want the Ferrari
If the Ferrari is there...
I'll be there
If not, I'll go up there...
your vote bank
will go down there
Why are you doing this?
Get down. Come home
Mom, stop talking
You're talking too much
The People's Representative
is not talking at all
Lokre
Speak, o Savior of the Masses
You're so brave, aren't you?
OK, go ahead and jump
Jump or I'll shoot you, Pakya
Dad's going to shoot me, man
Don't be afraid, Pakya
1...
2...
Don't move, Pakya.
He won't shoot

Holding his father to ransom
What does he think he's doing?
Just get him the Ferrari
You think it's candy?
My dad wants to be famous
Now watch
In front of the Press,
I'll arrive in a Ferrari
Kayo
Papa
Hi son
See this - the money
The money?
I'm going to Lord's?
- Yes
My Papa's the bestest
I feel one boy from every club
should go to Lord's
It keeps everyone motivated
Ajay, has any club been left out?
Yes sir. JD club,
MBM club, RC club...
RC Club... I believe
it's a very good club
We should have a boy from there
Who's the President?
Mr. Godbole
Godbole...
Call up Godbole
Ask him to recommend a player
Sir
Sir, on the board is a shortlist
of our 16 best players
Yes, but some of these
will back out
That first name, for instance
Unfortunately, he doesn't
have the money
No sir, he has no such problem
His grandfather came to me...
for a fee waiver
He's automatically out
Teja
Hello?
It's Vilayat
Yes sir?
Rusy, you've got the money?
Yes sir
I've got the money.
I told you
But he's saying you
don't have the money
Wants to cancel
Kayo's selection
Who, sir?
Who's saying this?
Dharmadhikari
I see now. it's a
misunderstanding
I have the money, sir
Can you...
come to the club now?
Right away. It's important
Sir, I'll see you there then
Bring the money
- OK
Rusy
Now turn around
Go on
Hurry up
Wait here till I get back, ok?
All the boys been signed up?
Let's fly to London
And wish you all a great,
happy new year
Happy new year, sir
Good evening. Gentlemen,
sorry to come in like this
This is my son, Kayoze Deboo.
Actually, Vilayat...
Hello sir
Vilayat called me.
I'm here to tell you that...
I have Rs. 150,000
- One moment
What's this?
How did you get in?
The selection is over
I don't even know
if this boy plays well
He's better than you ever were
Bowl to him once
He'll smash you
Deboo. You're back?
Tell everyone here...
Didn't you say you
don't have the money?
Rusy
- Yes Papa?
Give me the car key,
I'll get the money
Papa, I have the money
Car key, Rusy,
don't argue
Papa, the money...
- The key, Rusy
I've brought the money
You also brought money?
Yes
- Amazing
Here, Dilip
Tell me if you want more
I have another 150,000 rupees
Take next year's fee,
if you want
Did you count it?
- Yes. It's 150,000
All good?
- Yes
Well?
My decision is final
The selection is over
You son-of-a...
- Wait Papa...
Papa, one moment
Papa, please
For 38 years, Papa has
battled you in his dreams
He's hit you
But he never realized
he was hurting himself...
while you were untouched
But today if you play dirty...
I'll forget you were
once Papa's friend
You'll get clobbered,
Mr. Dharmadhikari
Seriously clobbered
Mr. Dharmadhikari
This boy was selected on merit
If he doesn't go to London...
all committee members will resign
You're going to London?
Take thermal underwear
so you don't freeze
Papa, can I go to the fountain?
Yes, go
Quickly tell me...
Where did you get
the money from?
I took it out of the Ferrari
The Ferrari?
I went to the police station,
covered the car, got in
I got in, but it was a
tense situation
The cops started towing
the car to Sachin's house
With me inside
I managed to slip out
with the money
Where did you get
the money from?
Give me a moment
- You must tell me
Tell me, Papa
Hold on. Give me a moment
Papa, tell me how
you got the money
I brought the car here
What car? The Ferrari?
Papa, this is Sachin's car
What is it doing here?
Gautiya dumped the car
and scooted
Give me the key, Rusy
We need to leave fast
Let's disappear
Yes, little one
You see...
the car came to your papa
for official work
I told your papa to get
the car home...
but your papa refused
So I called up Sachin
Sachin said - Please take it,
take the car
I'll top off the tank
and send it to you
I said there's a young
Sachin in my home
1... 2... 3...
What do we see...
Let's go drive all night.
Right, Rusy?
Come, sit
C'mon, enter your kingdom.
Very nice
Papa, we have to drop
the car off at Sachin's
Yes, I know.
We'll fly it there, you'll see
Hurry Rusy
Grandpa
Thank you
Grandpa
Does Sachin sit on this seat?
Since it's his car,
this is the seat he sits on
No seats behind, anyway
And this is the
steering wheel he holds?
When he drives, he has to
hold this steering wheel
You want to touch it?
Yes
- Go ahead
Such small fingers you have
1 2... and...
C'mon let's take a ride
Spin, roll or dip, you decide
It's a groovy trip all the way
In a oar that ain't a car...
but a whirlwind that
whisks you away
Fa fa fa fa...
Ra ra ra ri...
Fa fa fa fa... Ferrari
Sa sa sa sa...
Wa wa wa wa...
The swashbuckling
Ride in the Ferrari
Life bursts out,
bright and glamorous
From drab and dull
to unique and marvelous
We zip ahead without
a cars in the world now
It's a taste of
new adventure and cheer
Why waste the chance
we were given here
Let's dart away on
winged paths now
The heart holds sway
it must have its way
It's a magical night today
Fa fa fa fa...
Ra ra ra ri...
Fa fa fa fa... Ferrari
Sa sa sa sa...
Wa wa wa wa...
The swashbuckling
Ride in the Ferrari
It's a Ride in a Ferrari
A Ride in the Ferrari.. Yeah
Hello?
- Rusy, come home quick
What happened, Uncle Pesi?
There're some ruffians here.
They're asking for 'Rustom'
OK, I'm on my way
What happened, Papa?
Kayo, where's the money?
Here, in the bag
Pakya, the Ferrari
Kayo, stay inside
Rusy
Who are these people?
One moment
Who are these fellows?
Let me talk to them
Pakya, what's the problem here?
Tell me, do you people
have no other names?
I yelled 'Rustom' and
20 Rustoms came out
Then I asked them for the Ferrari
And they knew nothing of it
You didn't tell anyone
you have the Ferrari?
Pakya, what is the matter?
Please give me the Ferrari key
I can't. I have to return the car now
Look wise guy...
- Easy, Pakya
It's ok, man
I've cleared this with Babbu didi
You can check with her
Don't mess with me
Give me the Ferrari key
Pakya, that's not possible
Pakya, I'm sorry,
that's not possible'
Smart-ass
Pakya
Why don't you speak to Babbu didi...
Papa
Rusy, shall I call the cops?
- No, I'll take care of it
OK, enough of your antics
Let go of me.
Pakya, this is wrong
Pakya, you can't take this car
I'm taking it. Get lost
Papa
This is Sachin's car.
You can't take it
My papa got it from office
Get out
Hey mister, don't touch him
You can't take it.
It came to my papa's office
How can you take it?
It's my papa's...
Listen squirt, he stole it.
From Sachin
Hey Bandit King -
you didn't tell him?
Papa, you stole Sachin's car?
What the...
Kayo, I...
Where do you think
you're taking the car?
Stop, scoundrel
Kayo, wait here
Papa
Taxi
Mohan
It's almost midnight
Boss will be here soon
Tell me...
how much cash
do you have on you?
Look, a mobile temple
I have 500 bucks, Mohan
But it's still ten days
to my next salary
You'll get the next salary
only if you get the Ferrari
C'mon, offer it all to God
Only He can save us now.
C'mon, let's donate this
Peace and Wealth breeze in,
Suffering beats a retreat
The Ferrari
Ferrari
The Ferrari!
It's the Ferrari, yes
Mohan, this way
Hurry
Pakya
Get back inside
Found our Ferrari
Where?
- There, ahead
What happened?
I don't know
The Ferrari stopped
Maybe the carburetor is clogged
Go check it, quick
Open the hood
Which button do I press?
Press all the buttons
It's open
Pakya
What?
The engine fell out
What?
There's no hole underneath
How did it fall out?
Back off
Mohan
The engine's gone
The engine's in
Shamshu's furnace
This car's engine is
in the back, you blockhead
Look in the back
Pakya, the engine's here
The engine is safe
in a glass box
You. How did you know
the engine was in the back?
This is our boss's car
We also own an Alto, a Scorpio...
Tell him, Mohan
- Right
This is our boss's car.
Move away
If it's your boss's car...
tell me why it has stalled
Well, you see...
But why should I tell you?
Yes, who're you to ask?
Move aside
Go, Head of Security
- Take out the gun
What's wrong with the car?
The car's run out of gas
Now what?
Let's take gas from that scooter
Take gas from the scooter,
put it into the car
It's like this...
You don't put regular gas
into a Ferrari
A special kind goes into it
And only we know
where to get it
Listen up
Pakya
- Quiet
Look, I need your help
This is your boss's Ferrari?
Get me to my wedding
in this Ferrari
Once I get there...
the car's yours.
You can take it back
If you don't help me,
then this engine...
No, don't
How will we get him there?
The Ferrari is out of gas
Well?
The trials of life...
I have an idea
are eased by the Lord
Mohan, how much
farther is the gas station?
Why don't you take
the bullock's place?
We may reach faster
Any fractures?
- No sir
Hello, Uncle Pesi?
Rusy here
Could you please check on
Kayo at my house?
He's not answering the phone
Thank you
He looks fine
Let's get a CT scan
- OK sir
Rusy, Kayo is nowhere
You come home quick
Those goons were hanging
around for a long time
Kayo
Kayo
Rusy, where're you going?

Ask them
Where's his son?
When we left, he was
running towards the sea
And he was crying
Mom, this guy stole the Ferrari
His son got to know
I think he's gone towards
the sea to commit suicide
Be quiet
Suicide? Your son's

Where were you?
I'm sorry, son
I'm sorry, Kayo
I'm really sorry,
I shouldn't have done it
If I don't go to Lord's,
you think I won't play cricket?
I have the world's best coach
He'll train me
And you know, Sachin
didn't train at Lord's
He trained right here,
at Shivaji Park
And became the No. 1 cricketer
I'll be No. 1 too
100 centuries
Don't be upset, Papa
C'mon, be a good boy
Tomorrow, if I tell you
I want to go to the moon...
will you steal a spaceship
from NASA?
You understand, Papa?
I understand, Kayo
Now you'll say -
Look at the brighter side of life
Actually yes, Papa
If I'd gone to Lord's,
I would have gone alone
When I'm selected
for the Indian team...
I'll take you with me
I'll tell the Cricket Board clearly...
If you want Kayo in the team,
you have to take Papa along
I can't sleep without you
And who will wake me
for the match in the morning?
My Kayo's grown up
Grown up too soon
The flight has landed
Boss is back
Sorry, but can you
please hurry up?
Our boss's flight has landed
We have to take the Ferrari back
Babbu didi,
please return this money
Pakya, could you...
Thank you
The key, sir
Please forgive me
I must ask Sachin
for forgiveness too
Not today, sir.
We'll handle it from here
Meet him another day
You can take a photo
with him too
Yes. Sorry, got to rush now
Yes, I'll open it
Pandey, Boss not back yet?
Boss is back
When?
- Right now

Please don't tell anyone
I gave out the Ferrari key
Please don't tell anyone
that I opened the gate
I would've lost my
status in the village
Saved
- Don't worry
Well done
Kayo
You know something?
You put a ball into a sock
and kept knocking it
That really irritated me
Now throw away that rotting sock
I'll come to the nets.
I will train you
You will play for India
You don't need to
go to London
Those players
should come here
We could teach
them a thing or two
Stop here
C'mon little one,
give me a hand
Who are these people?
Uncle Rusy, put Rs. 50 in this
There you go
It's done
We'd collected Rs.149,950
Now we have the complete
amount of 150,000
This is for you
But what is all this?
Rusy, our Kayo will
go to London now
Uncle Rusy...
this lady contributed
the largest bundle
Come on up
The gentleman from the bank
also put in a big amount
And everyone from the colony
brought in 50,000 rupees
Now where's the gentleman
from the shop?
I'm here
And these are the shoes
you had marked
Kayo
All of us saw you on TV
Thank you, but I can't take this
Why not?
We're not giving it
to you for nothing

In 1948, during post-partition settlements, a lone Army outpost in a kind of no man's land was identified, wherein some files were kept. Both Indian and Pakistani armies sent a soldier to lay claim over it, not knowing that the other party had done the same. The Indian soldier is originally from Lahore, while the Pakistani soldier is from Delhi, having migrated during partition and having scars of the event deep in their hearts. An ironic story of pride and survival begins when, in an attempt to evade danger, they bump into each other. And amidst the continuous exchange of bullets, altercations, and murkier situations, it evolves into a journey of human connection with an unforeseeable end.",705,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt2063745.srt","Lone years aeo we made

The film is set on a winter night in Delhi, where a middle-class Delhi university guy falls in love with a girl anchoring a fashion show. In the process of wooing her, someone plants a sting operation tape in his pocket. This sting operation has a minister talking about buying and selling MLAs and media heads from his Swiss bank accounts. Unknowing, he is chased by corrupt cops and good guys to get that tape back. Soon he gets to know of tape with him and its high relevance. How this university student, who always talked against corruption like any layman, now gets bribed himself by the big offer thrown by the minister's man constitutes the climax of the story.",675,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt2402131.srt","It is said that there

when you run out of luck then..
..even a man seated on top

But I had never imagined that..
..the dog of fate

Why are you playing

And to support this noble
cause Rohit Pichwadia has launched..

courageous line Engaged 377.
This is my fashion line..
..to celebrate the
Article 377 of the Indian law..
..which gives gays their rights.

I'll make an MMS and send to everyone.
We'll tell the straight that it's
Rakhi's and we'll tell the gays it's Imran's.
You talk dirty things so nicely, friend.
You useless fellows, your
Popli father is calling you.
He wants to make xxxwith you both.
Do you know why people call me Popli?

Because our brother can
get into anyone and destroy him.
Who is this fellow with you?

Wear your helmet and hurry up.
I have to catch the last metro.
The girl shouldn't go away.
Has she gone there?
Many things happen at such big parties.
Maybe some rich brat
has taken her in a suite.
Your sister-in-law is not like this.
Dirty mind.
Brother, this is Delhi, this is Delhi.
When rich dirty
people come out at night..
..then the beautiful girls vanish.
What's going on?
Is this hurting
him or is he enjoying it?
You are enjoying it

Yes, I'm enjoying it.
Keep doing it.
I'm asking you the last

He'll be from his NGO.
Adarsh, Bharat Yuva
Dal ask this scoundrel?
To whom have you sent him with the tape?
The opposition or the media?
Who is this guy?
He is the father of all of you.
You all keep playing the
question game with me here.
There he must have reached the
place where he is supposed to go.
Congratulations Mr. Acharya.
Tomorrow morning
will be your nuptial night.
To whom has he gone to give the tape?
To which party does he belong to?
We've the desire to become a martyr.
I've to see how strong your arms are.
I've to see how strong your
arms are. - Shut up else I'll shoot.
What have you done
Sisodiya? He shouldn't have died.
He was our way to the tape.
I didn't try to;, I just
moved it and it triggered off.
Querishi don't stand here.
Put him in a box
and throw him in Yamuna.
Come on, quickly.
Rawat, show me the entire thing.
Querishi take him to that room.
There is an axe there.
And listen; cut him into
pieces eight inches long. - Okay.
Sir, he is working as
the cameraman's assistant.
Rewind it.
Listen, take his snap and send
it to check posts, railway stations..
..and bus depots.
ACP have you gone crazy?
Will you send his photo to the
entire police department and declare..
..what the boy has with him.
Appoint your close people in this job.
Your close people.
Understood? - Yes sir.
Sir, sir I am
tensed about only one thing.
If he gets caught but
doesn't say anything till morning..
..then your nuptial
night will surely take place.
Get some ideas.
Use your brains.
Try to do something to
justify your salary. - Yes sir.
If I'm punished tomorrow
then you'll be hunted down.
Sir, sir.
Go and find out about the boy.
Go! Go! - Yes, yes sir.
Oh no!
These potholes!
The illicit children of the ministers.
What problem do you
have with these potholes?
Houses are being
made with these potholes.
From the contractor to JE to AE
to the corporators and finally the CM.
And honesty is not the trend now.
Dishonesty is hot, super hit.
If I had these things
in my hands then I would've..
..taught these
corrupt officials a good lesson.
I don't know how people get easily sold.
Look, every person has a
price for his prestige. Everyone.
You and I will also have some price.
I don't have one.
Really? - Yes.
Assume.. - Yes. -..that
you meet a rich Arabic Seikh.
He tells you, ""Will
you spend the night with me?
I'll give you as much
money you want. As much.""""
Tell me how much
will you ask for? Tell me.
Come on.
I'm an untouched man.
Oh!
My prestige is not to be sold.
The person fixing the
price should be genuine otherwise..
..people open their shops in any way.
Understood?
Just quote the price of your shop.
I'm a small needy person.
I'll give it for 10 lakhs.
It'll get me a car and everything else.
You tell, just think of it. Think.
Tell anything.
Anything? - Yes.
You are taking so much time.
Don't feel shy.
What's the price?
68 rupees. - What?
Oh no! Has it increased again?
Look, it's written over there.
Are you giving gold through these pipes?
Here take it.
10 crores. - What?
I've decided.
Price for one night will be 10 crores.
Wow my friend. You are
roaming around with a helicopter.
Brother, brother, look,
sister-in-law in the taxi.
Oh yes, let's go, let's go.
Let Cupid bless me today
and I'll turn Mohan's house..
..into Mohan-jodaro.
Be victorious.
But do you have
protection? - No, my friend.
Doesn't matter I'll use polythene.
Take it. Enjoy! - Oh!
Just check the expiry date.
Situ, you are my true brother.
Tonight will be in your name.
Yes ma'am.
One ticket for Lajpat
Nagar please. - Sure ma'am.
Like any other guy my
weakness was also girls.
But fate had planned
something different that night.
Hello there.
Look mister, you are
following me from the hotel.
Stop chasing me
and get going from here..
..before I do anything to you.
Ouch!
Your bag.
What happened? Why are you laughing?
No, why did you have to do all this?
What did I do?
We've seen in films that the
girl lashes out at the guy first..
..and then slips and
falls in order to bring him close.
What nonsense is this?
Okay, doesn't matter.
But Delhi is not a safe
place for beautiful girls at night.
Come on I'll drop you. - What nonsense!
Madam, listen to me.
Excuse me sir.
Sir that guy is disturbing me a lot.
And that's why..
..I got trapped because of
that loser, frustrated, gay girl.
In that bogie of the last
metro at 11:40 God had sent..
..the love letter of my death
through the gorgeous girl in sari..
..because He knew that I would
take it if the girl gives it to me.
Hey stop! Stop! Hey!
Stop!
You cannot escape.
Come on. - Yes sir.
Where did the scoundrel escape?
You go there. -
Yes sir. - You come here.
Oh!
I'm talking to you.
Hey you Phantom!
Get down the bus is going to the depot.
You are going to
stop at Lajpatnagar depot.
I'll get down there, uncle.
I'll take it to your house.
Are you my relative?
Get down. - Oh!
Look, I'll take out the rod. - Oh no!
I'll hit you. Get down!
Auto! Stop! Stop!
Brother, Lajpatnagar.
Take extra money.
Oh no!
Sir! - Yes Dhondiyal.
Sir, there is a problem.
The boy has escaped from the station.
Dhondoiyal if you cannot get
that guy then you'll commit suicide..
..at my hands. - Sir, I..
And listen; find out the
girl he was chasing. - Okay sir.
Inform your mobile vans.
If you are unable to catch them
Dhondiyal I'll cut all your three legs.
Sir..
Three legs?
Oh no!
Sir, veg cheese grilled sandwich.
Delivery boy, Good Luck bakery.
Do you have a watch with you?
What? Yes, yes.
Keep it inside.
Keep it inside the box.
When you don't know how to

You've solved the problem.
He seems to be insulting us.
Increase your score.
What's my score? - 91.
At least a century

No sir. Forgive me. - Yes! - But..

What are you saying? - Do one thing.
Don't get caught by the
police tonight and don't go home.
But father?
I'll call your father and tell

Go to Mohan's place at Munirka.
Go there and chill.
Pick up a girl from the road.
Why? What happened? - Nothing.
You are the perfect
medicine for tension. - Hello, hello.
Situ, hello.
Have you died?
Oh no the battery!
Sir, we had decided

Now you are talking of 5000.
How does this lipstick look on me?
Why are you asking me?

Okay.
Oh my! She is such a gorgeous girl!

Do one thing.
Go and check this girl.
Find out from where she is coming.
Go.
Excuse me! Hello!

Actually the man is following me.
Who?
Hello, Pramod speaking.
He got scared. Scoundrel!
Thank you. - Welcome.
Shall I say something to you?
You shouldn't move
around alone at night.
Perhaps you don't
know that a man roaming..
..at night in Delhi is a hunter.
Really? - Yes.
Then who are you?
Me?
I'm the protector.
I've set out on a
mission to change Delhi.
I'm Lavina. - Okay.
My name Lokesh, Lokesh Duggal.
Friends call me Lucky.
Hello! - Hello!
By the way it's good
both of us have L initials.
Lokesh, Lavina.
Today's day is very bad for me.
I missed the metro and
am not getting an auto too.
I'm also feeling cold.
You are feeling cold?
Then what?
You are wearing such
a thick a jacket not me.
You are right.
It is quite warm.
Let's do one thing.
Let's go to the inn over
there for a cup of hot tea.
It'll make you feel warm and
you'll also get an auto somewhere near.
Shall we go? - Okay.
Let's go.
Where do you stay?
Elisa Girls' Hostel. - Oh no!
Lajpatnagar? - Yeah.
Strange.
There is the
Ganodara medical Store, right?
Come right from there,
the third house, pink color.
That is my house.
Opposite to Uttam Batora's shop.
The momo seller is
also there, he is my friend.
Many girls from your college come there.
To eat momos.
Really?
Then you too must be
a frequent visitor there.
To eat momos.
No, no. I don't go.
You too Ms. Lavina.
He becomes momos and
gets into their mouths.
He needs to be pulled out.
Ms. Lavina.
This is my first
experience of missing the last metro.
Yours? - Mine too.
I've a show here after 4
days. - Really? - Thank you.
And I'll have to take
the last metro from here.
Really.
If you miss that one then
call this freelance protector.
Of course.
What shall I bring for you sir?
Bring two hot piping tea
and two special Monalisa parathas.
Add extra onions to them.
What is this?
Nothing just rose water.
My eyes hurt a bit. For them.
Where are you from?
Dehradun.
Dehradun is a wonderful place.
I've heard two things are famous there.
One is Mall Road and
the second is the Bell House.
If the item is on road then
what will happen in the Bell house?
Everything will happen on road.
Oh my!
Lavina, sit here.
Now we cannot see her legs.
This guy has covered it up.
Don't worry, get my x-ray glasses.
Take it.
Here, hot tea.
Oh my!
Someone is going to
die at my hands today.
What can you see brother? Tell me.
Don't disturb an
English movie is going on.
Shut up you cheap morons!
I wish to get inside
the blanket of your English.
Lavina, ignore
them. They are cheap people.
We won't argue with them.
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
Is our mouth very dirty?
We also use an English brush.
Chotu, keep the change.
Let's follow the item.
There is no use
arguing with such cheap people.
Hey you boy, give the tape.
Which tape, brother? Which tape?
Hey! Don't act smart.
Quietly take out the tape.
What are you doing? - Take out the tape.
Leave him! Leave him!
What are you doing
brother? Leave my jacket. Which tape?
What do you want?
Is there anyone? Please help!
Bring four more parathas.
Someone please help!
Let's go to help the girl.
They are molesting the girl.
Let it be. You couldn't save yourself.
What can you do for her?
He is not going to
listen in this way. - Leave!
Leave!
Police!
Check him. Check. - Police!
Oh no! Close the door.
Give the tape. - Police!
Run! Run! - Police!
We'll see him later. - But..
Come on I'll tell you. - But,
police.. - Come on I'll tell you.
Hey auto, auto, auto.
Stop! Stop! Stop! -
Auto! - Stop! - Auto. Auto. Auto.
Bloody hell! - Oh no!
What's going on Lokesh?
Who were those people?
Which tape were they talking about?
I don't know those crazy people.
But you were with me today.
So they were spared.
I just had to make one
call and Delhi would've changed.
But I've seen their faces.
They don't know that I work for NSVP.
National Students Vidya
Parishad and the President..
..treats me like his brother.
Not India's President but the party's.
India's President
will also respect me one day.
I won't come with you
unless you tell me the truth.
I swear on you, I'm
telling you the truth.
Then why did you run from the police?
Oh no! I'll tell you. Come on.
So, this is my strange story.
Meaning?
It means when this
happens then this is the outcome.
Meaning?
It means that when this
happens then this become like this.
What nonsense are you speaking Lokesh?
So you didn't know
the girl with the letter?
Not at all.
I don't know from
where she came to dig my grave.
The last metro was fateful for me.
She just cut me off.
Now that you are telling the
truth tell the truth about the tape too.
I feel that there is a
double role related to that tape.
The Ram and Shyam type.
Shyam commits all the crimes
and it's Ram who suffers for them.
Ram-Shyam.
You are damn funny Lokesh.
Ram-Shyam. Sins.
You are really great Lucky.
You will impregnate her with your words.
Let's go. Oh no!
Oh no! Even these are empty.
I don't feel we'll get any auto today.
It seems difficult to reach
home in this condition, isn't it?
Oh god!
My heels are killing me.
My legs are hurting a lot.
Really?
I've a friend called Mohan.
His house in Munirka.
Let's go and take rest in his house.
We'll get a metro in the morning, right?
He is marriage
material and I'm a protector too.
I hate such decent girls.
Okay.
Mr. Captain.
What happened, Mr. Captain?
This is the respect that I get, right?
This is the respect
that I have in your eyes.
You'll steal a penny
on your Captain's birthday.
It's my 33rd birthday. 33rd.
I had committed more
thefts on my 9th birthday.
I did not give this
vehicle on rent today thinking that..
..I'll celebrate by
birthday with grandeur and loot Delhi.
You all are happy with petty thefts.
You are happy sealing sweets.
Shall I celebrate my
birthday with 10 rupee notes?
Mr. Captain.
Your birth is a gift for us.
For me for Bhati
brother for Mr. Choudhury.
Today is Captain's birth anniversary.
Mr. Captain tomorrow's
newspaper will carry the news of..
..your birthday celebrations
and not that of Mahatma Gandhi.
Yes.
Come on Mr. Captain.
Everything is left for you.
The entire night is left.
Delhi is full of
bounties. Sit inside the car.
Keep quiet and go. - Yes.
Go! - Yeah.
I'll manage something.
Guggu.
Wait!
Guggu, go.
What's there in this box?
Sir, nothing.
He slapped me very hard, uncle.
Even damaged my ear drums.
He also ate all the pizzas.
Uncle, uncle.
Uncle, stop!
Uncle, spare my Guggu.
I've made the mistake.
Punish me.
I'm punishing you, my nephew.
First you destroyed the cake,
then the sandwich and now the pizza.
I'll definitely recover them.
I'll sell the tape now.
If you incur further losses
I'll break this bike and sold it off.
You'll come back to your cycle status.
Don't talk; don't
talk about status, uncle.
I've saved every hard
earned penny to buy my Guggu.
My Guggu is my pride, uncle.
Please spare my Guggu, uncle.
If you wish you can sell my kidney.
I'll sell your kidney too.
Let the time come.
If you mess up the Chattarpur
delivery then I'll sell your kidney too.
Move aside.
I lost my ears and you your voice.
We are facing one
trouble after another today.
I don't know which area is this.
The mobile battery is also dead.
You at least have your mobile.
My one lost its
life in the road side inn.
I don't know where we got trapped.
You know I am dying to go to the loo.
Why do you girls feel the
urge to go to bathroom so often?
Bathroom!
And that too at such a strange time.
Shut up!
Hi He-man!
Hello Lavina! - Hi!
Has this lovely couple come
out for a night walk at this time?
No sir.
Actually we were
going to Lajpatnagar and..
..we got no auto so..
Oh! If you both
want I can drop you there.
But there is a small stop before that.
Is it fine with you?
Hello there. - Hi!
Shall I sit here?
Sorry.
It's fine.
You've sat on the gent's seat.
Rohit where will we go first?
We are going to Bamby's party.
Hi Rohit! - Hi Christy!
Hey Hi!
Ladies and gentlemen here
comes a legendary man-eater of Delhi.
Rohit Pichwadia.
What a wonderful party.
All hail Bamby! - Yeah!
All hail Bamby!
Oh no!
And now let me tell you the
reason of the celebration tonight.
Bamby's respected father..
..call him respected, a most
corrupt and inspirational politician..
..our ex-agriculture minister
on whom the opposition leveled..
..true charges of corruption
and a case was filed against him.
And finally today he
has been given clean chit.
He must have bribed
god knows how many people..
..to get that clean chit.
And I believe that one day
Bamby will be as spoilt and..
..as powerful like his father.
Yeah!
And now Bamby will
talk to the public now.
Thank you public.
Well, I'll try my best to
fulfill all your expectations.
But now, I am more
spoilt than my father.
There are two types
of people in this world.
One who is corrupt and
second those who want to be corrupt..
..and I'm the second type of man.
So, rejoice all you people
because the ultimate solution to..
..every bloody thing in
this country is corruption.
Hail corruption!
Hail corruption!
Sir, can I help you?
Sir, pizza. Delivery boy.
Hey our friend here
has got us pizzas here.
Pizza. - Pizza.
Oh it's hot!
Enjoy the party buddy.
Sir, bill.
Drink, sir.
Me?
Sir, drink. - Yes.
He doesn't drink. - Okay.
Soft drink. - Thank you.
You are welcome.
I'll just go to
the ladies' room. - Okay.
Why do the girls
use the bathroom so often?
Oh you are the one who
caught Rohit like a ball.
Aren't you?
Oh then we owe you a good time. - Yes.
Would you like to catch me if I fall?
I'll die.
What's your name miss? - Marcha.
Oh my god!
Room inside a room.
Come, come.
Oh no! One more room.
Welcome.
Hello there.
You are handsome. - Thank you.
You've got nice eyes.
Oh I'll die for you.
You like me? - Yes.
No, you like me.
No, you like me.
No, you like me.
No, you like me.
I like you all.
I am all of you like, yes babies.
Excuse me.
We are friends with Rohit.
Have you seen Lokesh?
He is lost swimming.
He is diving deep in the ocean of love.
Love. Love. 69.
He is mine. - He's mine.
Shut up you nbitch he is mine.
He is mine. - He's mine.
No fine. - No, he's mine.
I'm loving all you together.
Okay, okay, okay.
Inky, pinky ponky.
Pinky's ponky.
Inky pinky ponky.
Inky pinky ponky.
Wow!
Oh no!
Sir, sir, Rohit sir.. - I'm
sorry baby, please don't mind.
I'll be next, huh?
Who is this old bull huh?
Hey, hey, leave my things.
Sorry darling. You'll be fine.
Sir, sir give my money.
Please.
Don't make us laugh any
more. Have mercy on us Jackie Chan.
Oh my god how cute he is like a dog.
I hope I could make him my pet.
Hey guys, look at the
cotton coming out of his ears man.
Jackie Chan, can you
hear what we are saying?
Hello! Ding dong, ding dong.
Hey cartoon, you want money?
Yes.
Okay, tell your name first. - Nunna.
It might be yours but mine is strong.
You want money Nunna? - Yes.
Here is your money.

Look, there is a
price of every man's prestige.
I too have a price
and you too might have one.
They are assaulting me
without paying any price.
Oh god he is mad!
He is a monster.
He bit off my ears and also Ria's.
You must have him.
Come on Rocco, come on.
Rohit, come quickly, come fast darling.
I'll be back baby.
Nice.
If you are done shall we leave?
Is there a key? - Yes there is.
Come sit.
Hail Goddess.
Let's go!
My Guggu!
Lokesh hurry up, the mad
man is still running after us.
Did all the mad men of
Delhi have to run after us tonight?
Great Mr. Captain. Great.
What's the matter Mr. Captain?
You are not driving carefully.
Both of them have been spared alive.
Are you fine?
I've not taken down the
number else I would've destroyed them.
It's hurting.
But what will we do now?
Come.
It's a crazy night.
I've just been saved from getting raped.
Give my jacket.
No, I'm feeling cold.
Oh no!
I left my waist coat
over there in all this chaos.
Go and get it.
Remember that every man
roaming in Delhi at night..
..is a hunter.
Girls are hunted not guys.
I fail to understand
the strange likes of the rich.
Lokesh, shall I tell something. - Yes.
You are a good guy.
But I fail to understand
how you got trapped in this mess.
The police, tape,
politics, what's all this?
That's nothing.
You got hurt.
I was just making up to impress you.
Look.
Atma Ram College, M.A
Political Science, first year student.
I am an ordinary man. Check me for free.
Not a worker of
NSVP or anything like that.
But I do want to become one
to rip off these corrupt people.
But to become one you need to bribe.
11,000 rupees party fund.
If I got trapped in anything
it is because of that last metro.
For the sari clad
woman whom I don't even know.
You are telling the truth, right?
I swear on the goddess.
Look, one day we'll have
this big a garden in our bungalow.
I'll remove that pitch
and make a swimming pool.
There will be beer
instead of water in the pool.
All the friends will
take joyful dips in it.
And no tube lights.
I want to put up flood
lights like this in the garden.
Yes, and they'll remain
switched off like these ones.
Why? Why? Why?
Why will they be switched off?
I'll insert sensors
that work on snap of fingers.
Just snap your fingers
and the lights will be on.
Oh no!
I should've asked something else.
Hands up!
Hands up!
Go get him! - Come,
come. - Stop else I'll shoot.
Come on Lavina. - Catch the scoundrel.
Stop! Stop! - Listen Lokesh, listen.
Catch him.
Stop!
Hey you! Stop!
Hands up!
Sir, sir I'm telling the truth sir.
I don't even know that woman sir.
Why and how did she die..
To hell with the girl.
Come on give the tape.
Which tape?
I swear on your mother.
Hey you girl, where is the tape?
Sir, she doesn't know anything.
She is innocent.
Sir, the tape is in this jacket.
Sir.
Look for the tape, the tape.
Sir.
The tape isn't there.
It's in the right pocket.
Give my jacket.
I'm feeling cold.
Yes sir, I got it.
The tape.
Why are you
staring at the innocent girl?
So the ground under
the lover's feet has slipped.
We were following you.
Your beloved had called
us by giving a missed call.
Now you understand why
every friend is important.
Now, come on pay this girl for her job.
It's one lakh, my dear.
Come on hold it.
Come on take out the
wire or will you make us hear..
..what you do at home too.
Dear, this story had started
when you were in the fashion show party.
Hello there.
It is said that if you want to
drag the donkey to the river banks..
..then hang a carrot before it.
So, we looked for your carrot first.
And then we found you.
Sir, we got that guy.
He is in the taxi stand close by.
We could not take
the risk of arresting you.
What if you turn out
to be a rebel like Pandit..
..and hand over the tape
further or don't say anything..
..then it would be over for us.
We sent the bait to lure you.
Brother, is there any
auto or taxi stand nearby?
We just had to show
the carrot to the donkey.
And finally he is a donkey.
We had thought of making
you unconscious and searching you.
We had given your
beloved a weapon for it.
What's this?
Nothing just rose water.
My eyes hurt, it's for them.
It looks less.
Where have you used them?
Excuse me.
I had put it in his coke in the party.
Lover boy has lost his senses.
Now the most important question.
Whom do you work for?
Who has conspired against the minister?
And if you don't
tell us we won't kill you..
..but will jail you for only 14 years.
And will kill you every day.
With ease.
Sir, what have I done sir?
We'll tell you.
Aarti.
Ms. Aarti.
Ms. Anamka.
Not Anamika but Aarti.
Arti Utaru.
ASI Arti Utaru.
Sir, shall I undress him?
Yes, please.
It happened a long time back.
You and I were having an affair.
You promised to marry me.
I became the mother of your child.
Then you went back on
your promise to marry me.
You mentally tortured me so
badly that I committed suicide.
At the moment my dead
body is in Safdarjung hospital.
I have five witnesses to prove it.
If necessary I can bring five more.
Congratulations for
14 years of imprisonment.
But, but Ana.. Ms. Aarti,
..I'm meeting you
for the first time today.
So what? How does it matter to us?
Sir, he has been undressed.
Shall I leave now?
Yes, leave.
The rest of you go back to duty.
Sir, shall I go now?
Sir, keep this money.
I don't want it.
Madam, only two
things keeps a person quiet.
Bribe and bullets.
Which one do you prefer?
Hello! Yes sir.
Querishi, talk to him.
Hello.
Yes sir, the minister
was asking if you have..
..found that boy or that tape?
Yes. Querishi we've got the tape.
We are in the stadium
and the tape is in my pocket.
Great sir! Talk to the minister. - Yes.
Yes sir.
Have you got it, Sisodiya?
Yes sir we've got the tape.
Thank you sir.
No sir. We didn't come to know that.
He is not telling anything
Yes sir, that'll be fine.
Hey, stop the girl.
No sir. - Madam..
Come. - There is nothing like that.
Come. Come. - Okay sir.
It'll get done, sir.
Yes. Jai Hind!
Sir.
Dhondiyal take back
the money from the girl.
Shoot both of them.
- Okay sir. - But sir..
Come on madam. -
Sir, sir wrong have I done?
Come on madam. - What have I done sir?
Sit.
Look you get what you do.
You betrayer, now you too will die.
Sir, kill her first. Sir.
Shall I waste her by killing her?
I'll kill her slowly.
In the dark area over there.
You'll die first.
I'll feel ashamed in front of you.
Please, please sir. - Come on.
Please, please, please sir.
Sir. - Get ready.
Sir. Sir.
The name of Lord Ram
is truth. - No, no, sir.
Hands up! Hands up!
Hands up!
Hands up!
Come on, now give the tape.
The tape is not with me.
Sir has taken the tape with him.
Scoundrel, you've just been slapped now.
If you try to act smart you'll be shot.
I'm not lying.
The tape has been taken away by sir.
Ask him.
I don't know. - Hey you..
Now you are finished Dhondiyal.
Even God can't spare you now.
You broke my Guggu.
Hey, who are you?
Lokesh.
Lokesh, stop.
Lokesh! Lokesh! Listen!
Lokesh! Lokesh, I'm hurt.
Ouch!
Lokesh!
Ouch!
Lokesh!
Lokesh, can't you hear?
Lokesh I'm calling you.
Look, listen to me carefully.
You escaped from
there. It is you good luck.
If you follow me now
I'll kill you right here.
You girls should never be trusted.
Really?
You saved you and helped
you escape from the stadium?
Tell me.
You were standing like a statue there.
I am the one who
helped you escape from there.
Else you would've
been shot by that inspector.
So you are trying to
show how helpful you are?
Showing how helpful you are?
You are the one who led to that bullet..
..that too without any reason.
One I helped you
thinking you to be a girl.
I was with you the
whole night and you trapped me.
Why are you
talking to me in this manner?
Talk to me respectfully.
You were not
helping me by walking with me.
Mohan's room is close by.
Let's go there and relax.
You were just
looking for an opportunity.
I know very well
what your intentions were.
Intentions? Huh?
You sold me for one lakh and
you are talking of my intentions?
You cheap.
You!
What do you think yourself to be?
Leave me!
Leave me!
Let me go.
Leave me.
Why are you shouting now?
My intentions are not good, right?
Now I even have an opportunity.
Leave me.
Leave me.
I was trying to impress you.
Yes, I was looking for an opportunity.
But I had started liking you.
I had started believing you.
You talk of intentions, huh?
Sorry friend.
Forget what's happened.
Shut up! Lokesh.
I don't want to talk to you.
What do you think? I've trapped you?
I've been trapped because of you.
Neither had you come
following me to the station nor..
..would that mean inspector caught me.
I felt that I was
helping him nab a criminal.
I had not asked to pay me one lakh.
He left me with no option
and told that he'll jail me.
I felt so bad when I came to
know that you are being trapped.
That's why I helped
you escape from there.
But the way you treated me..
Lavina, I am sorry.
Lavina, I'm sorry.
Today I'm missing
your sister-in-law a lot.
Then call her from her
maiden house, Mr. Choudhury.
Then you'll keep
up the name of the Jats.
I remember a poem in her name.
Tell it, tell it.
Listen to it.
I miss you badly day and night.
Wow! Wow!
I miss you badly day and night.
It keeps me awake all night.
Great brother. It's very emotional.
I want to call you right now.
But the girl from the
customer care says that..
..I have a low balance.
Wow! Wow!
It's great!
Open!
Why are you not opening?
Hey, have you gone crazy?
No brother.
I'll open this machine else
I'm not the son of one father.
Oh no!
Lavina.
Listen!
You are going on the wrong direction.
The road is on this side.
Lavina.
It's fine.
How does it matter to me?
My birthday has been spoilt.
Don't say so Mr. Captain.
Why won't I say so?
Madam, do you wish to get hunted?
Excuse me.
Leave me. - Don't shout.
Lavina.
Lokesh! - Hey!
Lokesh! Lokesh! - Hey stop!
Hey stop!
Stop! Stop brother.
Stop! Stop brother.
Brother, please stop
brother, it's an emergency brother.
Thank you brother.
That car. They've picked up my friend.
Please brother. Quickly.
Hey brother. Hey! Hey!

Happy birthday to you.
Happy Birthday Mr.
Captain, happy birthday.
I've sung for you. Now

Mr. Captain heroine madam wants to go.
Won't you give her a return gift?
Feed sweets to madam. - Okay.
She is going to become a mother.
Happy mother's day.
Happy mother's day.
Eat it madam, eat it. - I won't eat it.
Brother, that car.
Brother, this is the car.
Stop! Stop!
Lokesh!
Lokesh!
Lavina!
Stop! Stop! Stop here.
Where are you going Lucky?
Where are you going brother?
We are supposed to save her life.
You need to give
life to save one, sometimes.
Hey they went that
way, they went that way.
Stop! What are you doing?
Stop!
Lavina. Lavina.
Hey you, stop!
Oh no!
Who are you?
Oh no!
Brother, forgive me brother.
I had to steal your bike in need.
I was stuck in a problem.
Forgive me.
This is the first time
someone has said sorry to me.
But it's too late now, my friend.
What? - Look in front.
Hey, hey, you crazy fellow we'll die.
Both the brothers will die together.
We'll die together.
Are you alive?
Oh no!
""Life should not
become death, be careful dear.""""
""Life should not
become death, be careful dear.""""
""Chains and buttons are being opened.""""
""Chains and buttons are being opened.""""
""The body is in danger.""""
""The body is in danger.""""
""Now take off your dress
quickly, beloved."""" - Wow! Wow!
Don't worry madam.
Have faith in us in this matter.
Mr. Captain, the cake is ready.
Cut it.
Why have you tied
this cloth on her mouth?
She is too stubborn Mr. Captain.
How will I kiss
her in English style now?
Kiss her in Indian style here and there.
You've slapped her so hard.
She has completely switched off.
Run from here. - Go! Go!
Oh no!
Just a couple of minutes Mr. Captain.
Don't start. Rape break.
Why were you looking inside?
Sorry uncle. Sorry.
Sorry uncle sorry.
You are stopping us
from entertaining ourselves.
Is it already midnight for you?
Hey don't talk of midnight.
No one can do anything
to us we do it to others.
Look at the sardar.
He is denying it and saying it himself.
Hey! - Hey! - Hey!
Hey!
Who is it?
Father he was talking about
midnight and he is not even leaving me.
Leave the boy or you'll be slapped.
Hey! Shall we catch you then? Huh?
Why? He is a strong man.
His one slap and you'll be dead.
Mr. Captain!
Mr. Captain, the scoundrels have..
This fat one.
98.
Hey you!
This scoundrel!
Aloo paratha.
Makki ki Roti. Sarson da Saag.
Lassi. Cooler. Maggi.
Rope bed. Clarified butter. Butter.
Santa Singh. Banta Singh.
99.
Whoever utters this
phrase shall be fulfilled.
Eternal is the holy timeless God.
Take flowers.
Clarified butter. Mother's milk.
It's over.
There's been a robbery.
They've disrespected me.
It's on me. They've disrespected me.
It's on me.
Please forgive us.
We are just joking.
Oh no!
I'm done.
I'm done. They disrespected..
Now say whose midnight is it?
Ours.
Leave us.
Why are you disrespecting us?
Father, they've agreed.
Yes, so let's allow them to go. - Okay.
Just a minute brother.
Where is Lavina?
Sardar, they've
kidnapped Lavina, my friend.
Where is she?
She is in the car.
Take her.
You too go.
Lavina.
Oh shit!
What have these scoundrels done?
Sprinkle water on her face. - Yes.
Lavina, are you okay?
You okay?
You okay?
Lokesh.
Quiet.
Come. Come.
Come.
Thank you, sardar.
Can I get a shawl for the girl?
I'll kill you. - Enough!
You bloody dogs.
Enough! Enough!
Leave us to do the
work of thrashing them.
Brother, take them to
your sister-in-law. - Okay.
Come, come. Come.
You!
Wait brothers.
I've a better idea of
dealing with them than thrashing them.
Idea. What idea?
We were badly insulted today.
I'm worrying about him.
He has gone into coma.
Mr. Captain.
Mr. Captain.
Mr. Captain.
Brother, I desperately
feel like spitting on their face.
Why do you want to
spit? Pee on their face.
How does it matter to me?
Come on uncle.
Come on look in front.
Don't look back.
It's a surprise.
Is it feeling hot or not?
It's perfect. Keep going.
His mileage is good.
This should be done to
anyone who molests women.
It shouldn't have ended.
Great! Keep going, keep going.
This is pee of revenge.
It won't finish so soon.
Father, I want to go to latrine.
Thank god he didn't do it.
Peeing makes no sense.
And especially on his birthday.
I say that next time we'll
celebrate Mr. Captain's birthday at home.
Mr. Captain, shall we
stop somewhere and take bath?
I'll take bath with that boy's blood.
Turn the car Choudhury.
Turn the car. Turn!
We have no value after marriage.
We are your slaves, girls.
Well said brother.
Just let it be.
You don't even take me
for movies. Yes. - She is right.
I showed you a film yesterday, Dabanng.
Then? - Really? On Star Gold at home.
Forget it.
They need just two things.
Alcohol and chicken. - Yes.
Everything ends there.
Oh! You look so beautiful.
Isn't it? - Yes, true.
But why are you so sad?
Your hero has saved you.
Yes Manjeet was telling us.
He came running for
5 kilometers to save you.
The boy has been
clean bowled in your love.
I really adore it.
No, no, there is
nothing like that between us.
Really?
If there is nothing
like that then it'll happen.
Come on wear this.
It'll shine bright.
You know how to
convince others. - Let it be.
Look, this is what is going to
happen in future with you. - Yes.
Wow! Great! The
party has become interesting.
Parminder's dress
looks good on you, Lokesh.
Thank you. - It has fit you well.
The boy is handsome.
Where is Lavina?
Sister-in-law, where is Lavina?
Look, here is Lavina.
Sit down friend, sit down.
Lavina come here.
Listen to what these guys are telling.
They must be talking nonsense.
Okay? - Yes sir.
Rawat, turn on the tape.
Yes sir.
You both always
leave your work incomplete.
Go and catch the girl and the boy.
Sir, what shall we do about the
people from Adarsh Bharat Yuva Dal?
They are patriots
we'll sacrifice their lives.
Come on, come on, start it Rawat.
Start it.
Forward it. The sting
operation must be ahead.
Stop it!
My grandma used to say
that drinking it is useful.
Cow's.
Move aside.
Sir, I feel that you've digested it.
Kill that boy.
Take the tape and cut him into pieces.
Sisodiya, if he remains
alive you won't be spared.
Understood? Go!
Shall I go with him, sir?
All of you go but listen to cut
off his penis before chopping him.
Now go. Go!
Did you connect to that boy's number?
No, it's switched off.
Scoundrel.
Be careful.
Come.
Leave me.
Sir. Sir.
Meet us outside the
station in ten minutes.
We need to catch that guy again.
What? - He gave us the wrong tape.
He is a tough nut.
You girls don't value the guys. - Yes.
Talk of something
which we should value. - Yes.
Really? - There is nothing they can do.
Come on girls
we've seen them let's move.
They can do nothing. Let's get up.
Come on, let's go, let's go.
Dhondiyal.
Put on the speaker. Speaker.
Hello!
Where are you?
Why have you called?
Because you are helping
that boy instead of helping..
..the country and the government.
We know that the boy is with you.
Is he with you or not?
You've got your tape, right?
Now what do you want from him?
Hey you, don't act
too smart the two of you.
The boy had brought his
doom by giving the wrong tape.
Hey, what do you mean by wrong tape?
Have I opened up a library?
I had only one tape with me.
Hey you hero finally you spoke
up, you are trying to act too smart.
We've seen with our own
eyes that Pandit had put..
..the tape inside your
jacket's pocket in the hotel's lobby.
And you've handed us this tape?
You wanted to make
the minister drink urine.
He has asked to break your neck.
Sir, he disconnected the phone.
Have you traced the call?
Yes sir. They are on Gurudwara road.
Come on.
Which tape are they talking about now?
Who is this Pandit who
kept the tape in my waist coat?
I cannot understand.
Hey stop!
Hey what are you
doing? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Does anyone do such things?
Oh no!
What happened?
My waistcoat.
If the tape is there
it'll be in my waist coat.
In that farm house.
But how shall we go there at this hour?
No, my son, don't walk to that place.
It's not safe. The girl is with you.
Parminder! Bring the car keys, my son.
They all are dead drunk.
Come on Lokesh.
Come. - Come, come.
This was the room.
It'll be somewhere here.
I've got it. - What's this?
Oh no! Adarsh Bharat Yuva Dal.
But we must first see
what's there in this tape.
Yes, let's go.
Come, come. Here is one.
What's there in this bloody tape?
Look, it's very simple.
In order to stop our government
from dissolving we need six members.
Two from you and four from you.
But Mr. Acharya,
everyone's asking money in advance.
Look, we are taking more
time to bring the 400 crores..
..then we took to earn it.
Look, you know that it takes
long to bring money from Swiss bank.
Mr. Pandit, am I
right? - Yes, absolutely.
Look, you'll get 15
crores each by tomorrow evening.
It's Gandhi's birth
anniversary on 2nd October and..
..there'll be bundles
of currency in your homes.
Oh shit!
Yes, my friends from the
media I have two work with you.
One the Swamiji from
Adarsh Bharat has started..
..fasting against us.
He is trying to prove
himself as a big patriot.
Mr. Pandit. - Yes. - Come here.
Keep the bag there and you come here.
Meet him.
He is Devraj Pandit.
He is the right hand of the
Swami but he is joined to our body.
Secondly,unfortunately lot
of my scams is being revealed.
Show less of them. Try to
divert the attention of the public.
Mr. Acharya, what can we do?
Your party members are accused
even in the scam of Jansayog report.
We need to show them.
You need big news then tell me.
We'll arrange a blast in
Jantar Mantar. 10-15 people will die.
It'll be sufficient
news for one week. Show it.
What do you say Mr.
Pandit? - Yes, absolutely.
Oh my!
15 crores will reach
your home by tomorrow evening.
Sisodiya. - Yes sir.
Oh my god!
Holy shit man!
Move from in front of me.
Give me that tape. - Tape, tape.
Come on Lavina, let's go.
That's some amazing stuff man.
I want the tape.
Okay, okay.
Shit!
Lavina, come, come.
What happened?
Sit down all of you.
Why are you standing?
Because Katta is standing.
And he has decided to take you to task.
Do we smell?
No, not at all.
Smell, smell us you scoundrel.
Do we smell or not?
It smells, it smells very bad.
You'll smell more than us.
A mixture of all of us. - Cocktail.
Undress yourself. - What?
Undress yourself. - Open.
Hey you!
I never undressed myself so
many times as I did in this one night.
Remove your hands.
A buffalo in your shorts.
Doesn't it strike?
It isn't a buffalo.
It is a bull.
Bull. Turn, turn, let's see its tail.
He is a free bull.
Today we'll tie a
string to the bull's tail.
What do you say Mr. Captain?
Drop your underpants.
No one will move from here.
Everyone should
watch him being disgraced.
Please forgive me Mr. Captain.
I'm your younger brother.
I got swayed in the
company of the sardars. - Shut up!
Drop your underpants.
Drop your gun.
What's happening here?
Is a shooting going on?
Come on, get going from here.
Phantom have you
plugged your ears? Drop your gun.
What if I don't drop it?
Then I'll shoot your head
and make a lampshade out of it.
You'll keep emitting light.
Century brother! Century!
Mr. Captain!
You scoundrel, rascal, your mother's..
What? What were you
saying, sir's mother's?
Huh? Speak up.
What were you saying, sir's
mother's? - Blessings, blessings sir.
If you have any problems then tell me.
Sir, sir, he just moved.
When a Jat dies know that..
..you are done.
When a Jat dies know that..
When a Jat dies know that..
..you are done.
Come on baby. - That tape, damn it!
Please baby, come on.
What is this baby? Come.
Sleep baby. - Come.
Okay baby. I'm coming, huh.
Yes hero, where is your madam?
She..
Madam! Oh madam!
Bring your sexy self here.
Come, come.
Before we carry out the
funeral of your lover we..
..thought of thanking
you for calling us here.
Mr. Captain, I got swayed
in the company of the sardars.
Drop your underpants.
I saw that the Jats had..
Hello Delhi Police control room.
Who is towards Chattrapur?
Who is towards Chattrapur?
Some Lavina and Lokesh
Duggal's life is in danger.
Is there any unit nearby?
Come in 216, come in 216.
I'm in Chattrapur, I'm going there.
Bhusan Dhondiyal is my name.
I take out melting needle from fire.
What do you say sir?
Take u-turn.
The public is in
trouble and I won't come?
How is that possible?
I had called 100 to
save you from the Jats.
I didn't know that
these rascals will come.
Even our mothers didn't
know that we'll be scoundrels.
You've worn a nice pair of underpants.
Thank you sir.
Come on take it out.
Sir please sir, even you too.
This is against law. My underpants.
Take out the tape, you scoundrel.
Tape?
Sir, tape is not with me.
If you say this again then..
Sir, sir, sir, the
tape is with them sir.
What? He is lying, sir. - Yes.
He is lying, sir. He is clearly lying.
Do I appear to be
in the position to lie?
The tape was hidden in my
clothes and they snatched away my clothes.
Undress yourselves. - Sir. - Undress!
Undress! - Okay sir.
There is nothing in it.
Come on get down.
Sir, what are you doing? - Sir..
I'll search everything inside. - Okay.
Hey!
Sir, I don't know why they..
Oh no!
Come on, tell where the tape is?
Else the next bullet
will be aimed at her head.
Sir, please sir, I'll give you the tape.
Please leave her.
Just look at the
love this guy has for her.
I can become a girl to get your love.
Look, I've left her.
Now take it out.
Sir.
You are a rascal.
Strange, the work that the
bullet couldn't do was done by this girl.
Come on, give the tape.
Not there, here.
Have you come for a
wedding party that you want tape?
What? Hey you boy give the tape here.
Hey, does the tape
belong to your father? Say.
Then is it your father's?
Come on your game is over.
Hey you boy give the tape to sir.
How come you all have come here to die?
I have called them. - Quereshi.
Not to die but to kill.
I can find out even the
melting needle inside fire.
What do you say sir?
Take u-turn.
Quereshi!
You betrayer.
Your sins had multiplied.
The time to stop it had come.
I'll destroy all of you
if you don't drop the gun.
What's going on?
Dhondiyal. - Sir.
Who has the power now?
I'm your wife's lover and
my name is Sarfarosh Choudhury.
This is not a caste war.
What do you want?
Give that boy and this
inspector to us. That's all.
We don't want anything else.
Look, you can take the
boy after we are done with him.
But the one whom you
are abusing is our sir.
We cannot give him to you.
Then even Lord
Hanuman can't save your sir.
Nunna!
Nunna!
Nunna!
Lokesh!
Lokesh, wait there.
Let's go. Let's go.
Lokesh! Lokesh, listen to me.
Lokesh, where are you all going?
Lokesh!
Come on.
Run! Come on, come on.
Hold on. Yes, let's go, let's go.
Lokesh, you boy.
Listent o me.
Dad, I need to get that tape.
I'm locked in here.
The other key is kept on
the window sill in bathroom.
Listen, Manohar Acharya is
the same guy who had labeled..
..true charges of
corruption against your father.
We won't get a better chance to
overturn the government than this one.
Therefore listen to me carefully.
Come on, come on, fast.
Lokesh! Listen, listen to me.
Hey listen.
Hey, where are you going?
Lokesh, stop.
Lokesh, what are you doing?
Just a minute.
Hey!
Hey Lokesh!
Open the door.
Lokesh, what are you doing?
Lokesh! - Oh no! - Listen.
Stop! Hey!
Listen! Lokesh listen o me.
Stop!
Open the door.
Lokesh!
Look I won't do anything.
Stop, listen to me.
Lokesh! Lokesh, stop.
Lokesh, open the door.
Lokesh!
Listen to me. - Lokesh!
Open the door.
Lokesh!
Lokesh! Listen! - Listen to me.
Lokesh, Lokesh, what are you doing?
Open the door, give me the tape.
No Lokesh, don't give
the tape to this scoundrel.
All the policemen are
puppets in the hands of the minister.
This tape must reach the common man.
He is right Lokesh.
The public should know how
corrupt Manohar Acharya is. - Okay.
What will happen if they come to know?
Someone else who is
corrupt will come in Acharya's place.
Just think for yourself Lokesh.
How much would you've
earned for working in one night?
500? 800?
Today I'm ready to give
you 50 lakhs for this tape.
Now tell what you have to say.
If you work for 17 years
except on Sundays then you'll..
..be able to earn 50 lakhs.
Lokesh, give this tape to the
people of Adarsh Bharat Yuva Dal.
Yes, yes. - Okay.
Lokesh, what are
you doing? Don't be crazy.
You won't get such an
opportunity in life again.
Nothing will change
if you give this tape.
But 50 lakhs can
change your entire life.
Shut up! Every man
is not saleable like you.
Look brother, every man
has a price for his prestige.
I have one and so do you.
I don't have one.
Come on give it to me. - Okay, listen.
If you feel that 50 lakhs is
a small amount then take 1 crore.
What do you say? - The
person should quote the right price.
Else everyone's shop
opens up in some way or the other.
Okay not 1 crore but 2, 2 crores.
Cash, right now. Hand to hand.
Tell, tell your price.
This is the opportunity.
Okay, okay listen.
5 crores.
5 crores.
10 crores.
What? - I've decided brother.
The price of my one night is 10 crores.
Okay final, 10 crores.
10.
Lokesh, don't be foolish.
Give me the tape.
15.
I want 15 crores.
I'll give you brother.
I'll give; I'll
give, right now, in hand.
What are you saying Lokesh?
Have you lost it?
Lavina, 15 crores.
What can't I do with it?
My entire life will change.
Forget your anchoring
we can open an even company.
Look you.. - Lokesh,
listen to me carefully.
You are selling off
the rights of a common man..
..in greed of money.
Watching this tape and
knowing the truth of the minister is..
..the right of the common man.
Which common man?
Which common man are you talking about?
One who sells his
vote for a bottle of liquor.
Or the one who never comes to vote.
Nothing is going to
improve in this country this way.
Nothing better can
happen in this country.
And even if I let go this
opportunity to earn 15 crores for..
..that common man then
how can you guarantee that..
..they won't vote Manohar
Acharya again for two bottles of liquor?
Do you take
guarantee for the common man?
No, right?
Look you've stopped talking.
Great my friend!
Such an impressive lecture.
This logic has washed off all my sins.
Wait.
Take this.
The key to your good fortune.
There is an ambassador car down there.
There are 5 suitcases in the dickey.
One is yours.
Count it and be
satisfied and then give me the tape.
Okay.
Come on, go.
If you open this then
our journey together ends here.
Yes, keep roaming about.
Look at Mr. Mehta's son.
He earns 35,000 per month.
He has bought a
flat. And look at yourself.
Brother, Mercedes.
One day your brother
will buy a car like this one.
I had never pressurized
my brains in my entire life..
..the way I had done on that night.
I was neither swimming nor drowning.
I didn't know if I was in
water or engulfed in tsunami.
The common man has
his right on this tape.
I didn't know what god
can do to a man in one night.
He can do anything.
Come on. - Yes, anything.
Hello!
In today's breaking news a
tape given by an unknown person has..
..created a stir
in the political circle.
With the help of the sting
operation done by Sri Sri Shivanand Swami..
..C.B.I has arrested Chief
Minister Manohar Acharya for..
..possession of black money
and for buying legislative members..
..and media with the money.
Corruption! Shame!
Shame! Corruption! Shame! Shame!
Corruption! Shame! Shame!
Corruption! Shame! Shame!
Corruption! Shame! Shame!
Corruption! Shame! Shame! -
Sir, what about the 75 crores..
..that is with the police?
Sir, the countrymen want an answer.
I would like to tell my
countrymen that I'm clean.
This is a fake tape. I'm being framed.
Someone has just thrown a
slipper at Mr. Manohar Acharya.
You can see that the
police is arresting that man.
After this stunning disclosure
the public and the opposition parties..
..have got enraged.
Rallies are being taken out
against Mr. Manohar Acharya in..
..different parts of the country.
You can see here that a
garland of slippers is being..
..put around the
puppet of Manohar Acharya.
Two prominent politicians
of Bhartiya Janadesh Party..
..and Swadesh party has
been suspended for taking bribe.
DCP Ramcharan
Sisodiya has also been suspended.
The CEO of News Media
Sailesh Roy and TV Live's President..
..Sohail Biswas who
were shown in the video..
..are also being questioned by the CBI.
You can see that it's
raining slippers behind me.
The public is enraged and
they are throwing slippers. Oh no!
Who threw this slipper?
We are from the media.
And now we would like to
tell you about the person..
..for whom all this became possible.
Adarsh Bharat Yuva
Dal's secretary Ashok Gandhi..
..says that this young man is
just 23 years old and is a student..
..of Delhi University.
He was offered a bribe of
15 crores not to give the tape.
But he valued his
honesty more than money.
And he understood his
responsibility towards his country.
This man handed over five
suitcases containing 15 crores each..
..that is 75 crores to the government.
The man has refused
to disclose his name and..
..he calls himself a common man.
NTV 24*7 salutes this unknown
hero on behalf of the entire country.
What a wonderful person! -
Yes man! He is the right guy!
Who does this nowadays?
I'm dying to know who he is.
I would love to meet
him. - Bye, see you, bye.
Protector.
Commuters please pay attention.
This is 11:40's last
metro from kendriya sachivalay..
..Central
Legislature to Badarpur border.
Hello there!
Lokesh!
What has happened to
you? - This? Just like this.
It's a long story. I'll tell you.
Tell something about yourself.
I've been travelling in this
last metro for the past four nights..
..just for you.
You told me that you
are doing one more show here.
That's the reason.
Today's show was at Gandhi Auditorium.
Thank you Bapu.
Seems Gandhiji will help us to unite.
That night was
Gandhi's birth anniversary and..
..today it is
Gandhi Auditorium, isn't it?
How are you Lavina?
I'm happy but a bit confused.
Confused?
About what happened
that night? - That night..
..my tube light was
switched on after some time.
But it was finally switched on.
How come that happened?
You were defused till I was with you.
Just after you left the
electrician of my fortune entered.
It doesn't matter to me if
you keep the suitcase or not.
Give me the tape or
I'll shoot you right here.
Hey, leave him.
Shut up, you scoundrel.
Look, listen to me. - Shut your mouth.
It won't take me two seconds
to shoot a saleable dog like you.
Hey! - Hey!
You feel bad, right?
You are a dog.
Saleable dog belonging to Sisodiya.
You understand the term dog right?
Dog is loyal but to
the master who feeds him.
When a dog loses control he
doesn't leave his mother or sister.
There is no
difference between you and a dog.
Because you've set a
rate for your mother land.
You can also sell your mother. - Hey!
Quereshi, what are you doing?
Have you become crazy?
Look, you are a Muslim..
..and they belong to the
Hindu party Adarsh Bharat Dal.
They'll just throw you
out when their work gets done.
Try to understand.
Patriots are of the same
religion, you betrayer. Patriotism.
Come on give the tape else
your dead body will be lying here.
I'll give 15 crores to you too.
What do you say?
Give the tape. -
Lokesh, he won't do anything.
Don't give him the tape.
I'll get the tape over your dead body.
Quereshi, now..
Give me the tape, damn it.
I'm not an idiot like him.
I'll not count till three. I'll
take the tape over your dead body.
Give me the tape, damn it!
Give me the tape.
It is my tape.
Come on give it to me, damn it.
Come on, bye.
I could've pulled the
trigger after two seconds.
But I want to give
you one more chance, Lucky.
If you sell yourself today you
won't be able to buy back yourself..
..in your entire life.
The decision is in your hands.
Do you want to become a dog or a man?
Hail India!
Quereshi.
Good that he died.
He was boring me.
Lokesh!
Come to your senses, my king.
All this keep on
happening. Give me the tape..
..go home and count the money.
I'm so proud of you Lokesh.
But why didn't you
disclose your name in the interview?
You would've become a hero
if you had disclosed your name.
That's because I did nothing heroic.
I just did what I felt was right.
And I don't want useless
credit for not doing anything wrong.
But you are a hero, my hero.
Oh no!
If you had kissed me like this
the other night then I would've..
..forgotten 75 crores just like this.
Just a second, just a second.
Naughty!
Did you call us madam?
There is no one naughtier than us.
Mr. Captain, we've got this fellow.
Tell us what shall we do?
Let him go.
He has made a place
for himself in my heart..
..by letting go of 75 crores.
We are useless chaps.
We even steal bananas and then eat them.
Kiss her I am not watching.
Kiss her else we'll kiss her.
No, no.
The next station is
Lajpatnagar. - I'll kiss her at home.
My stop has come. Bye.
I had almost died there.
I don't want such
surprises in life. - Really?
Then what sort of surprise do you want?
Mercedes?
It's mine.
Really? - Yes!
How did you by such an expensive car?
I helped the government
nab 75 crores of black money.
The government awarded me with 10%.
I bought this car and a flat too.
Really? - Yes.
You are a rock star.
Rock star protector.

A wanna be actress Julie (Raai) struggles through sleazy innuendos before caving in and getting embroiled in the shadowy world that purportedly finances the film industry. Her first love Mohit abandons her at the first sign of trouble while her second Ravi Kumar (Ravi Kisshen) uses her and moves on to his next conquest. The third one is Dubai Don Lala (Dev Gill) and her fourth a cricketer who thinks she won't suit the sati savitri image his parents expect of his bride. So that leaves Julie in a huddle and egged on by her woman Friday, Annie (Rati Agnihotri) she chooses Jesus – only to be gunned down the day after her symbolic baptism.

The rest of the film has a ferocious looking ACP Dev Dutt (Aditya Srivastava) trying to arrive at a decent enough reason for her murder. Of course, the power broker with CM aspirations and a dead wife who looks like Julie's doppelganger, may have something to do with it.",921,NA,NA,NA

2015: Veer Bakshi and Raj Bakshi are brothers working as car tuners in Panaji. Veer helps Ishita and damages the car of a customer in the process. To discipline him, Raj makes Veer fix the car at night. Veer falls asleep while fixing the car and wakes up to find that the car's sound system has been stolen. Veer soon gets into a tussle with ""King"", a drug baron, whose henchmen threatened Ishita. Veer is injured and gets admitted to the hospital. Raj learns about this and thrashes the gang members, with the help of his friends Shakti and Anwar. Raj burns their stash and reveals himself as ""Kaali"". King suspects Raj to be Kaali due to the tussle between King and Veer. However, Raj's humbleness convinces King that he is harmless and makes a deal to fix their car in exchange for their safety and protection.

2000: In Sofia, Kaali and Veer are sons of Randhir Bakshi, a crime boss. Kaali comes across Meera during one of their chases with Randhir's rival Dev Narayan Malik. Kaali falls in love with her and the two begin to spend time with each other. During a shipment delivery to Randhir, Kaali gets attacked by Dev's henchmen and Meera reveals herself as Malik's daughter. Meera spares Kaali's life as it was her birthday. Kaali confronts Meera, chases her car and saves her life when she almost falls off a cliff. Overcome by remorse, Meera declares her love for Kaali, who eventually forgives her. Kaali and Meera reveal their relationship to Randhir and Dev, who agree to meet each other. However, Dev tries to kill Kaali and his father in a shootout. Dev and Randhir end up shooting each other to death. Meera sees Kaali holding a gun next to Dev and assumes that Kaali has betrayed her, where she shoots him. Kaali survives and is convinced by Shakti and Anwar to forget about the past and start a new life with his brother Veer, while Meera also starts a new life.

2015: Veer discovers that his friend Siddhu was the thief who stole the car's parts and had been giving them to his boss Oscar, but spares him as Siddhu reveals that he did this for his girlfriend Jenny. Veer proposes to Ishita. Raj learns about their relationship and decides to meet Ishita's sister, who is actually Meera. Upon meeting Raj, Meera immediately forbids Ishita from meeting Veer again. Veer and Ishita try to figure out why their siblings dislike each other so much, so Veer and Siddhu try to confront Shakti (Siddhu's brother) and Anwar. Veer and Ishita scheme together to rekindle Raj and Meera's relationship.

Raj's lieutenant Mani steals one of King's cars and brings it to the shop. Veer, Mani and Siddhu discover drugs in the car's decklid and burn them. Upon realising Ishita loves Veer deeply, Meera issues an ultimatum that Veer must move in with Meera in order to marry Ishita, leaving Raj in the process. Enraged, Veer proceeds to storm out and Meera reveals to Veer that Raj is actually Randhir's adopted son and not Veer's biological brother. Raj confirms this and embraces Veer. Raj confronts Meera for trying to ruin his relationship with his brother, where he reveals that he never betrayed her. Malik's right hand man Raghav meets Meera and confirms Raj's innocence. Meera takes Ishita to Raj's house, declaring that Veer can live with Raj and Ishita after marriage and Meera apologises to Raj.

At Siddhu and Jenny's wedding in a church, King finds his car, which is being used as a wedding car, and brings Mani, Oscar and Veer, demanding to know about his drugs. King loses his temper after learning what happened and a fight ensues in which Raj reveals himself as Kaali and thrashes King. King tries to kill Raj, but Meera takes the bullet and King is beaten up by Raj's friends. Meera is admitted to the hospital, where she recovers and reunites with Raj.",3779,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt4535650.srt","Good morning, Raj sir.
Good morning, Raj sir.
- Good morning.
Where's Veer?
He's taken Jerry's
car out for test-drive.
Okay. Good. Good.
Hi, good morning, Raj.
Good morning, Raj.
Raj...
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
It's been 15 years since
that incident occurred, Raj.
Oh, God. Save me.
Spare me... Don't beat me.
Hey...
Listen to me.
What are you all doing?
Stop.
Why are you all beating him?
Stop, please. Why are you beating him?
Raj, he stole Mr. Almeda's
cellphone and was trying to flee.
Why do you do such humiliating
things in the first place?
Whatever I have done,
is not my choice.
It's my helplessness.
What helplessness?
Alcohol...or gambling?
- Shakti!
Let him speak.
I admit that I stole from him...
But it's not for me.
I did it for my younger brother.
For your brother?
- Yes.
After my parents died...
...he became entirely my responsibility.
I take care of him by stealing.
Why do you steal...to
take care of your brother?
You should do some work.
I am not educated.
A good-for-nothing loser.
What else can I do other
than steal from people?
Come and take a peak in my home.
I've a house,
but no money to pay rent.
There's a bulb, but no electricity.
Please...don't cry.
Shakti, give me your wallet please.
Please relax.
I...
Here.
Keep this money.
- No...
No, Actually, keep all of it.
In case you need more,
then that's my house.
You can come anytime.
You're giving money to this Mani.
But I stole...
- For your brother!
And when it's about your brother...
...one thinks from the heart,
and not mind.
Veer...what are you doing?
If anything happens to the car
before delivering it to Jerry, then...
...Raj and Shakti will skin us alive.
Chill, Siddhu.
I worked really hard
to modify this car.
I won't let a single scratch on it.
Enjoy the ride boy.
She's coming this way.
I think she needs a lift.
- You're not offering a lift to that girl.
Why? - You know what
brother always says.
What?
- Girls spell trouble.
She's standing there all alone.
- I'm calling him up.
Don't be crazy...
- Are you driving or should I call him?
Fine, I'm going.
Lift
That was a really nice
and tall girl you made me miss.
Just keep driving quietly.
Brothers bootlicker.
- What?
What now, Veer?
I need to pee.
- Pee? What?
Come along and give me some company.
This is not some couple-dance.
And I don't need to do it.
You'll feel like doing it while
after watching and hearing me do it.
Come on.
Now?
- Not yet.
<i>Now '2
' N“ yen!</i>
Now?
- Yeah...
Well, not me.
- Veer. Veer.
Concentrate on your peeing,
someone might see you.
Veer...where are you going?
Bye.
Veer!
Hi.
- Hi.
Ishita.
- Veer! Can I help you?
Actually, my scooter broke-down!
Oh no.
- I was heading to the Municipal Office.
You see, I am from Bangalore.
And I need to submit these papers...
...in order to open
a restaurant in Panjim.
And today's the last day.
The office will close
down in 10 minutes.
Can you please give me a lift?
- Let me hold you first.
Huh?
- I mean the car-door...
...so I can open it for you.
Please come.
Oh, God! Traffic!
What now?
Don't worry!
Watch out!
Thank God it's open.
Veer, you just made my day!
Thank you so much!
It's okay, it was my duty.
Bye.
- Bye!
Hello.
- Veer.
Yes, brother.
- Jerry had called
Where is his car?
- Yes...
And is everything okay?
- Yes, the car's...
Is fine!
Look, Raj...if Veer was fast...
...doesn't mean you should get furious.
Cool it , Raj.
Chill, Raj.
Cool down, Raj?
Should I go cozy-up in the fridge now?
How did this happen?
What was the reason?
Brother, I...
- Pee.
Pee?
He said he needs to pee...
and I should give him company.
As soon I started
peeing...he ran off. - Where?
I guess he went looking
for an open space.
Raj, peeing out in
the open is too much fun.
Disgusting Anwar...
Please don't discuss
your personal habits here.
How did this happen, Veer?
Brother, all this happened...
...because I was trying
to help a helpless girl.
Helpless girl?
- Yes.
Poor girl had to get
to the Corporation Office.
She had a deadline to meet
I gave her a lift, and in a haste...
And brother, you always taught me...
...I should always be good,
even with the bad.
Sol...
And if it concerns a girl, then...
...even if you've to smash the car,
but still...
...you must go out
of your way to help her.
No, no...
What are you laughing at?
- But I was only peeing.
That's all he's capable for.
Brother Shakti...
Pee
Tavde...get the screwdriver.
Yeah.
Can I leave?
I've to take my girlfriend for dinner.
Fine, go...but don't
wear shorts on your date.
Thank you.
Pintu. I can't seem to open this.
- Can I go too?
Where do you have to go?
I am taking Tavde and
his girlfriend out to dinner.
Fine, go.
- Thank you.
Be on time tomorrow.
- Yeah.
Excuse me.
Veer.
Ishu.
-lshu?
What are you doing here?
- Same old story.
My scooter breakdowns
more often than I can count.
I'll check, I'm a professional.
- Okay
lshu, it's got a serious issue.
- Really?
So now? - Do one thing
Give me your address.
I'll fix your scooter and
enter your house to deliver it
Huh!
Did you get your paperwork done?
- Oh that, yes!
Thanks to you.
Are you a mechanic?
- Mechanic.
I am the owner of this place...
The whole and sole of this place.
But all this is because of you.
Because of me?
In order to drop you
at the Corporation Office...
...this is what happened to the car.
And due to that...this
is what my brother has done to me.
Day and night...just work.
Oh I am So sorry!
I feel so bad for you Veer.
You feel for me?
Yeah...it's because of me
Come here.
Sit here. Here!
Who are you?
- Huh!
But yet...my heart wants to
share its personal feelings with you.
Go ahead, Veer.
Do you know what brother did...
...after seeing the
car in this condition?
What did he do?
He slapped me 10 times
in front of everyone.
Yes.
- How humiliating.
Didn't you stop him?
He's my elder brother.
I can't...
It still pains.
- Let me see..
But I don't see any marks?
These are not exam papers
where you get to see marks.
Silly girl, it's on the inside.
You know what, lshu...
...since the time I was a kid,
I loved studying.
But my brother...squandered
my entire education money...
...on his girlfriend Uma Bai.
Why didn't you ever retaliate?
Confront him?
You should, Veer!
What ""You Should""?
This woman's been provoking
me all the while. - Veer?
I won't hear another
wrong word against my brother.
He's my elder brother.
- Yeah! Yeah!
You crazy woman!
She's mad!
Really?
- I don't know her.
Oh...so he's your brother!
What kind of a brother are you?
You made him quit his studies.
And who hits his younger
brother like this.
Aren't you ashamed?
He won't tolerate this anymore.
Get that? - Okay.
Veer, come here.
Don't be scared.
- No.
Vent out all of your anger.
- Vent it out.
Come on, Veer...be your name.
Come on, Veer...be your name!
Say it.
- Say it!
I...
Actually...he wants to say that...
...his heart doesn't agree to this.
He wants you to leave.
If I fold my hands and apologies
in front of you. He won't like it
After all, he's my younger brother.
But don't worry.
I'll apologies a lot to him.
Fine.
- Thank you.
But you don't be scared.
If there's any problem, just call me.
You have my number, don't you?
- You do, don't you?
Good...good...
Don't worry, he won't need it.
I am sorry. I am sorry, brother.
Who was the girl? You're always cooking up
stories after meeting a girl, aren't you?
Come on. Let's go have dinner.
- No, brother.
I've sworn...l won't eat a
morsel until I don't fix this car.
No, Veer. You can't do that.
How can you stay hungry all night?
Don't be so hard on yourself, please.
Veer, here's your
double-chicken burger.
Hi, brother.
- Hi.
Is this yours?
- No!
You know...l can change
any car in this world...
But not you.
Goodnight, brother.
- Goodnight.

Brother took your burger.
Should I get more for you?
I've seen lshita,
I'm not hungry anymore.

Good morning.
Veer... Son, take a look.
Another robbery?
- Yes.
The music system's gone.
- Yes.
I fell asleep again.
- No!
It got stolen even though
you were on watch, son.
Exactly...who keeps
stealing at our place?
Oscar bhai.
Hi my cool...like an
empty swimming pool.
Come to your papa.
Here's your BMW 5 Series
Hi-fi music system.
That's more like it.
You know how to pull ropes...
...Like Dominoes and Pizza Hut.
You get things so easily...
...almost like you're
stealing from your own home.
There's no talent like you here,
Sony Moserbaer.
Oscar bhai...if you're
so impressed by my talent...
...then how about you
give me some bonus.
You see...it's my girlfriend's birthday,
I want to impress her.
Of course... Of course...
Because today it's
also my sister's birthday.
Hello, Jenny.
Baby I've made arrangements
for the evening birthday party.
Wow! Wait, hold on.
I'll ask my brother first.
- Yes, okay.
Hello.
- Hello, brother.
Speak up my dear Laado...
Rolex, Rado.
My friends have arranged
a birthday party for me.
Can I go with them?
- Of course, without a doubt.
Go live your life.
Here you go...Pampers, huggies.
Hi.
- Hi, Veer.
I've fixed your scooter.
- Oh, great.
Thanks.
How much money do I owe you?
- What money?
You don't charge your kin.
How sweet.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight.
What's wrong, Veer?
Are you waiting for someone?
My friends were coming here
to pick me up.
I'd given them your address...
Wonder why they haven't arrived yet.
I don't know.
I'm sure they must be on their way.
By the way, if you want...we
can have coffee together.
Together, what?
- Coffee!
Actually, Veer...l was thinking
about you before you got here.
What?
I mean...your brother
How can he? Seriously Veer
I've never seen anyone so insensitive
and selfish like your brother.
How can any brother
be so heartless? - lshu.
Ishita, I lied to you.
- Lie.
My brother is not like
how I described him to you.
He loves me a lot.
More than you can imagine.
For me, I am always
first and then the rest.
Then why did you do all this?
Well...
When I saw you,
I wanted to talk to you.
After talking to you,
I wanted to be your friend.
You were giving me sympathy as well.
So I got carried away.
Veer.
You're crazy, you know.
What's up, GUYS-
This is my friend, Sid...
...and that's his girlfriend...Jenny.
Hi.
It's Jenny's birthday today.
- Oh...happy birthday.
Thank you.
Ishita, I am sure you're
getting bored at home alone.
There must be a problem
with the cable as well...
...and the internet speed's
must be slow too.
Right?
- What?
What he really means to say
is...why don't you join us for dinner?
Now, at this hour...
- And anyway.
You should never say
no to the birthday girl.
Yeah!
- Come on.
Come on, lshita. It'll be fun.
Please come.
Come on.
Come on, lshita.
Okay, fine.
I'll just change and come.
I won't sell your drugs here.
Youngsters come here to have fun.
And I won't destroy their lives...
...by selling them your drugs.
We work for King.
King. Get that.
Keep the stuff...and sell it.
You have to sell it!
Excuse me...this is not the way.
Let uncle go.
Don't interfere...
Uncle Joe, you have to sell the stuff..
- Look here.
Let uncle go...or else
I'm calling the Police.
Oh my, God...you just murdered Her incoming
outgoing international communication device.
What?
- Mobile!
Why did you break her mobile?
I just broke it.
Are you hurt?
Are you her boyfriend?
He's not my boyfriend... - Whether I am
or not, that's our personal matter.
We'll sort that out later. lshu
Uncle Joe...what's the matter here?
They are King's men.
And they are telling me to sell drugs.
Drugs!
Get lost. Come on.
- Leave!
Hey Hero...you don't
know what you've done today?
You just beat up King's men.
King isn't going to spare you.
- Get lost.
What happened?
Beat him.
Die!
What's going on?
Hey...
Veer...
Who is that? Stop!
Stop them
Veer.
Veer. Are you okay?
Are you hurt? Who were they?
He's okay now,
you can take him home tomorrow.
Veer, take proper rest. Okay.
Thanks, doctor.
- Thank you, doctor.
Be honest, who were they?
- I don't know.
Siddhu, do you know?
- I... I...
I don't know, brother.
Hey...
does it pain?
- Not too much.
Brave boy.
Here you go,
maybe this will make you feel better.
Isn't this the phone you wanted?
Yes, but how did you know?
- I know everything
Veer, are you okay?
- lshu.
She's a casual friend,
but formal hi-hello.
Isn't it lshu.
Hi, brother. Ishita.
She's very strict,
she might get furious.
Be clear, Ishita or...lshu.
Whatever your heart likes
It's a good thing you're here,
or I would've come to you instead.
That day your phone broke.
This is a gift for you. New phone.
I got it for you.
But...how can I take this?
L...really can't...
- Keep it.
He got it for you with a lot of love...
new phone.
And anyway...you'll need a
phone for your formal 'hi-hello'.
I insist, take it.
Thank you.
Hey... take care.
Take good care of yourself Please
See you GUYS-
New phone.
We've found out...
where we can find them!
Oh no!
Hey...who's there?
Michael, take a look.
Hey, stop.
Hey...you don't know
who you just messed with?
When King finds out,
he won't spare you.
Then tell him my name.
Tell him Kaali had come.
How much did he take ?
He took nothing, just burnt everything.
Burnt it?!
Who dared to burn King's stuff...
Who?!
I don't know, king.
His face was covered.
He just told us his name and left.
How long are you going
to take to tell me his name?
Kaali.
Kaali!
Who is Kaali.
King remember the boy from the garage
we beat up. He has a big brother.
It could be him.
How can it be him?
It can't be him
Nothing wrong in checking.
Let's go take a look.
What is it?
What?
Hey...
Veer. Veer!
Veer, what's going on?
They are the same guys who beat me up.
Right then...
You beat them up, they beat you up.
Scores settled. End of story.
- Now leave.
But... - Veer.
You know I don't like violence.
Siddhu, take Veer away from here.
And give me that stick.
Pintu-Tavde...get back to work, go.
I am really sorry.
I am truly embarrassed...
- Very fair.
That was amazing justice.
- No, sir...it's your greatness.
I am just a small-time car modifier.
A connoisseur of cars...
Like for your old
classic...re-modified beauty...
...El Dorado 1969,
is very close to your heart.
Of course it is.
And it should be...
...because your beloved
father gifted this to you.
You're amazing.
Are you a car astrologer?
- No, sir.
It's just years of experience.
That's fine, but how did
you guess about the father bit?
You're an amazing man.
- No, sir, you're the amazing guy.
You're the man, just look at you.
With a hat.
Your...your father
must be so proud of you.
No!
He's dead.
- I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?
- I am okay.
Are you fine?
- I am okay.
Can I tell you something?
- Yes, of course.
I killed my father.
He was no school-teacher,
he was a Don like me.
But when I took over the business,
to increase our sales,
I started selling drugs.
My father said,
""NO! its against our principals.""
Against our principals?!
Our business has no principals!
So I killed him.
Patrick! Joshua!
From now on all my cars
will get modified here.
From today Raj will rule on Kings cars.
Nice one .. Ain't it?
Put that gun away.
Put that gun away!
Are you scared of guns?
Everyone is scared.
But you don't need
to be scared anymore.
Because I am there...
For any problem, you call on King.
If he's Kaali...then I'm not king,
I am the Queen.
Let's go.
He was pointing a gun at
you and asking... ""Are you scared""?
Since we've turned decent...
...the entire world has turned rouge!
Kaali...
Malik sir, we tried our best.
But couldn't stop Kaali
from taking the gold container.
Raghav...are Randhir's
men getting better...
...or our men getting useless?
There was a time when Randhir and I...
...used to commit small-time
robberies at the docks.
And now he's messing with me.
That tone in his voice...is
only because of Kali.
Shakti.
- Yeah.
Have you checked the list
for the meeting we called tomorrow?
Yes, I did.
You need to Wrap this
and be careful, okay? And ..
You'll carry on, I'll join you.
And those two,
they need to be wrapped
and they are sold so just be careful.
Hi. Excuse me.
Yes.
- I...
Yeah, that one.
I am really sorry that
you're so injured because of me.
No, no, it's okay.
I'll get well within few days.
I'll drop you in my car.
No, no, it's okay,
I'll catch the tram. - No, allow me.
I'll drop you till there, please.
- Okay.
I am so sorry.
- Its okay.

Okay, alright.

Gangsters?
Actually,

What?
Have you heard about Randhir Bakshi?
That Indian Don...who settled down here?

It's my phone.
- Oh... Thank God.
Give me your number.
My number?
Yes, I mean...I'll call
your number from my number...
...and then you'll have
my number on your number.
Oh really..
- Yeah, really?
I mean...when you go to the hospital,
they will give you the bill.
So you'll have to call me and tell me.
Or is it No?
088743... 3...what?
Come on, come on quickly.
- Brother.
Give me a five.
Yes!
What tall you've become.
Papa“.
How are you Veer?
- I am fine.
Look at all the gifts we've got for you.
This means I'm not going
home this time either.
No one loves me.
- Veer.
And brother,
you don't even remember me.
Veer...why are you including me?
Veer!
I'll go handle it.
Veer. .. Oye!
Dad's just...
What should I say?
You're absolutely right.
We only come meet you once in a month.
But... that's a different thing that
without you, every day seems like a month.
And also you're right,
I don't miss you at all.
But... that's a different thing that
that we only miss someone we can forget.
And you're absolutely right,
we don't take you home...
But... then it's a different thing that,
we're making a new home...
...which will have a
huge room for little Veer.
Where You, me and Dad will
live in it together.
Really, brother?
I love you.
Bye.
What are you thinking, Dad?
Just that we can't let Veer
stay with us because of this enmity.
There's always threat to life...
...and he's only a small kid.
But Kaali, if it wasn't for you...
...I don't know how I
could've handled all this.
No, Dad.
Can I say something to you in a honesty?
Sometimes I wonder...
if I've been unfair to you.
You see...I'm educating Veer here.
But...l always kept you close to me.
Burdened you with the
responsibility of my work.
And always put your life in danger.
I mean...just because
you're not my blood...
...I hope you don't misunderstand me.
No, dad.
Not at all.
I had no one.
You picked me up from the streets.
You want to know the truth, Dad.
Even you don't know this.
But you love me more than Veer.
Really!
Promise me, Kaali...
...Veer should never know that
you two aren't blood brothers.
He'll never find out.
But promise me...
you'll never discuss blood ties again.
Careful.
- Bye, Kaali.
I'll see you, dad.
Hello, Meera.
Actually,
Kaali, I called you here because...
...there are some guys
who've been bothering me.
Good good.
Kaali.?
Kaali.!
Are you listening?
- Yes, I am all ears.
Some guys have been troubling me.
They bother me.
And...l am the only Indian
Sketch artist in this area.
So...they also pass racist comments.
- Really?
Yes.
Just tell me where I can find them.
Hey, Indian girl.
Did you sketch that one?
You wanna make a portrait of me.
I'll give you a kiss in return.
Come on, don't be shy.
What is your problem?
Get the hell out of here.
What's wrong?
Where are you going?
What happened to
all that attitude? Yeah!
Nothing to say? Huh!
And you...you wanted to kiss me, right.
Go ahead.
No.
No?
Who the man now?
Me the man.
Yeah...and you want to see
how the Indians do it? Huh?
Touch me.
Touch me. Just touch me.
Touch me now.
Just touch me.
Touch me...What?
They are gone.
They had to.
Come on.
- Okay.
I taught them a good lesson.
- Yeah, wow!
Martina, just wrap up please.
- Bye Martina.
And thanks to you too.
- No, no What did I do?
Meera, you were saying
about those hospital bills.
If you give them to me,
I'll pay for them.
No...don't worry about it.
Today is your lucky day.
- Really, why?
You helped me out today.
So scores settled.
Wow! You're so fair.
I must admit, Meera.
- You must. - I agree.
Take today for instance,
I had to interfere after all.
Yeah, the way you interfered...
""Me the man."" Me the man.
Very impressive.
It's important to
make them fear you. Yeah.
If only they had stayed a minute more,
I would've...
No, no, no, Meera. Forsake your anger.
You don't get it, Kaali.
You have to adapt to the worldly ways.
There's no point
in living like coward.
Cowards are the ones who...
Oh my, God! Oh my, God!
Don't move, Meera. Freeze.
- Why?
If you move,
he'll feel threatened and bite you.
Looks like a wolf.
But don't be scared.
Just be still. Breathe with me.
Breathe in.
Yeah. Breathe with me.
Bad doggie. Good Meera. Breathe in.
Breathe out.
Keep breathing. Nice.
Good Meera.
Is he coming back?
- Who?
I think you scared the dog away too.
Just“
Meera, I wanted to know...
...can you have lunch with me today?
I've to visit dad's art gallery today.
- No problem.
Dinner tomorrow?
Tomorrow...is mom and dad's anniversary.
Oh darn.
I mean good. Congratulations.
Breakfast day after...
- Well, day after...

Tell me something, Meera.
You told me about your dad
and also how special he's for you.
Is there anyone else in
your life who's just as special?
Are you trying to find out?
- I've found out.
You wouldn't have come on
this date if there was someone special.
And here we are. Let's go.
Allow me, ma'am.
- Okay.
And thank you very much, Robert.
- Welcome, boss.
Alright.
Meera, this is my favorite restaurant.
And this is the first

- Yeah, you like them?
Love them,
I think they were beautiful.
Aaawww
Actually, they were so beautiful...

your eyes off them.
I don't think you're talking
about paintings anymore.
Kaali.
Kaali!
Bill. You're Right.
Only four minutes left. Get the bill.

Oh lovely, We're here.

Although we came this far,
but you got your flavor.
Thank you.
- Cheers.
Thank you.
Oh, wow!
Belgium-chocolate...nice.
I am loving it.
Actually Kaali, seeing you like this...
...it's hard to believe
you do such a dangerous job.
I know, I'm a pretty boy.
Aren't you scared?
I had no weakness before,
so I had no fear.
But now...l don't know.
So...any other surprises?
- Of course.
It's not over yet.
Here you are. Thank you.
Flowers for my lady.
Thank you, they're beautiful.
- It's alright.
Anything else?
- No!
You gave me only five minutes,
so...date's over.
Damn!
So I think you like me.
- Of course I like you.
I paid all the bills, in cash.
I must like you.
That's true.
So let's meet tomorrow?
I've an important job tomorrow.
We can meet day after. Please.
But...it's my birthday tomorrow.
- I am so sorry, I didn't know.
But..
If you don't come,
I won't celebrate my birthday.
You see, Meera...I've to take
a consignment to Romania tomorrow.
Dad has spoken to the border police.
Everything's been set.
And we must deliver the
consignment to our buyers tomorrow.
Please.
- Then I'll come along too.
We'll celebrate my
birthday on the border.
Good idea.
- No! Bad idea.
Our rival Malik had his eyes...
...on the gold consignment
I'm talking about.
You can say that I have snatched
this gold away from him.
And you don't know
Malik...he's a dangerous man.
Anything is possible. Over there
You don't know how
dangerous it is out there.
Really.
You're not letting me come,
nor are you coming over.
This is not done.
I won't celebrate my birthday
without you, and that's it.
Okay, then...I'll finish
my job tomorrow at any condition...
...and be back by tomorrow evening.
To you.
Sure?
- Sure.
Promise.
- Okay, yes.
Promise!
Kaali...we'll definitely meet tomorrow.
Bye.
""Never say goodbye.""
""Always be mine,
never say goodbye.""
Someone is following us.
Keep moving.
Hi.
What happened?
You look shocked...
...like your entire
world turned upside-down.
Didn't I say...we'll
definitely meet today?
And what did you say?
""Don't come...it's dangerous.""
Actually...the danger
you were talking about...
That danger is me.
You didn't get it.
Try to remember, Kaali.
What did I tell you my full name was?
Meera...Dev...Malik!
Malik!
My dad!
""The tone in his voice...
is because of Kaali.""
And you know the best part...
...it's my birthday, but...
I'll gift this gold to my dad.
Because...I'm one of
those big-hearted types.
That's why I planned all this.
What did you think?
You rammed me with your car?
No...l came in front myself.
So that my men could kill you.
But they missed.
And the things I had to do after that...
...to get the gold's
information from you.
Pretended to be cripple...
I made my men pose as my enemies...
And I even went on
that stupid date with you.
God!
By the way...how was my acting?
World-class, right?
No!
I spare you...
It's my birthday.
I won't spare that Malik now.
- No, dad.
You won't do anything.
I'm the one who's been betrayed...
...so I'll do what needs to be done.
- But...
Please, Dad.
I want to meet Meera once.
Hello.
- Stop the car, Meera.
Meera, stop the car.
Stop the car, Meera.
Don't be scared.
I won't let go.
I have loved you with all my heart...
...and didn't use my brains,
like you did.
Meera... after today don't ever
show me your face again.
I will kill you.
""Goodbye. .""
I am sorry.
I've been unfair to you.
Whereas to you...have only loved.
The thing you had faith on...was love.
But the only difference was...
...that you realized it first.'
And I have realized it now.
You might not even believe me...
...but I have to say this.
I love you!
Kaali!
Kaali, Listen to me
Kaali, I won't leave until
you don't believe me.
Please, Kaali.
Just believe me.
Please.
Kaali...
Kaali!
Would you like some dinner?
I see...you must be on a diet.
It's raining,
how about I get you some...
Coffee! Coffee!
It's okay...
What do you want to prove?
- That I love you.
Why should I believe you?
You believed me when
I didn't love you.
And now that I do,
you don't believe me.
What's the problem?
I don't want to be betrayed again.
You can shoot me if I do.
Firing bullets...
using guns.. taking lives.
Isn't there anything else you can do?
I don't.
But you do.
You Teach me.
Please!
""Permeating through the sunlight.""

Kaali.
We should tell our families about us.
I don't want them to
find out from somewhere else.
It won't be nice.
Yeah, you're right.
You know, I can convince my dad.
But what about your dad?
I hope he doesn't think that...
...Me and my dad have cooked
up some plan to deceive him.
I will explain it to him.
And anyway, he doesn't hate you
as much as he loves me.
Yeah...l am sure.
But tell me one thing ...what if Me
and my dad have really made a plan?
So Then I will shoot you!
Another robbery?
- Yeah.
Imported headlights are gone too.
- Yeah.
I fell asleep again?
- Yes.
You're so consistent, Veer.
This car needs to be
delivered in the evening...
...but we don't have headlights.
I wonder what's going to happen.
Don't worry, brother.
This is my fault.
I'll think of something.
Leave it to me.
Anwar, what are you doing?
Raj, he's is the thief.
Look at what he was stealing
and going with.
Mani, back to your old tricks again.
It's a cake.
That's what I've been trying
to tell you, that it's a cake!
Mani, you're stealing cakes now?
No, Raj, it's my happy birthday.
I bought this cake from his cafe.
Look, I even have the bill.
I thought I'll sit
with my brother Raj...
...and we'll eat this cake together.
Just because a man is dark skinned
you will trash him so hard.
Sorry, Mani. Sorry.
Anwar, how could you
without seeing or thinking...
Mani, there's been a
theft in the garage again.
So there's a bit of confusion.
- I see.
Sorry.
- No, no not a problem.
Come on... let it go..let's cut it.
- Who?
Your cake.
I got scared.
Anwar, get the candles.
Don't take it to your heart,
he's a bit emotional.
So he raised his hand on you.
Anwar
You too Anwar.
Hey...why are you sulking?
Mani bhai, I need to arrange
for imported headlights.
Where do I get them from?
Imported headlights?
- Yeah.
Don't worry.
There's only one
man you can get it from.
Oscar bhai.
Wow, Mani...you're so lucky...
Like Nokia, Blackberry.
My no. 1 thief just called.
He's getting the same
brand projector lamps...
...like the one you wanted.
He said he stole it last night.
Do it fast, son.
See...this speaker and
That music-system...which are sold.
Look here.
This is a BMW Steering Wheel.
All this is his loot, Mani.
When will my...
I mean, your no.1 thief?
Wait for 5 minutes.
He must be on the way...
McDonald Subway. - Okay.
We'll wait outside.
- Yeah.
It's the same thief who
robbed our entire garage.
Let him come...
- Yeah, let him.
I'll tie a wrist
watch on both his arms.
What will that do?
Then he'll know his time's up.
He's got the same headlights.
Oscar bhai...
- Yeah.
Here's comes my number one
'Chor' (thief)... Boxer, Labrador.
Keep it.
You are my ace of spades...
best in best.
Keep this...30,000 Siddhu.
Go and squander all
of it on your girlfriend.
But tell me one thing.
Just like ATM spins out money,
how do you manage all this?
Coffee.
- Coffee? Coffee
Oscar bhai, I've a friend.
And he trusts me more than required
I put sleeping pills
in his coffee, and...
Siddhu...!
Veer...what are you doing here?
Veer, listen to me...
Let's sit down and talk.
Rascal..
Veer...
- Beat him.
Why are you running?
Stop!
Stop thief.
Don't let him go.
Veer. Veer.
Stop!
Veer...
Veer, listen to me.
Veer. Veer.
Hit him.
Hit him. Hit him.
<i>How dare you touch Rays stuff'?</i>
How dare you steal at Raj's place?
I'll cut off your hands.
Veer, enough. Enough!
Nagpada- Agripada...
He's down. He's fallen down.
Veer... Veer, we can discuss
this over a cup of coffee.
Coffee!
To hell with your coffee...
- Enough! Enough Veer!
I took you as a brother not as a friend.
I would've tolerated it
If anyone else had done this.
But you did this to me.
Let's go, Mani.
What happened Veer?
I didn't ask you to stop...
then why did you stop?
You must have said 'stop' 50 times.
I just blurted that out in extempore.
How can a bus fit in a tempo
Extempore...Mani bhai.
- Was it a big tempo?
Mani...quiet!
Veer...you saw what your brother did.
And how.
But...you consider me a brother,
don't you?
You never bothered
to ask why I did it.
Look at me.
The same old shirt,
the same old jeans...
...and the same old
shoes that you gave me.
I have never spent a penny on myself.
I have spent everything
on my love...my Jenny.
It wasn't easy to win her heart.
You rascal...look at your own fate.
We both grew up in a boy's hostel.
No sign or symbol of girls
And when we came out...
we were surrounded
by a brother or an uncle...
We spent our entire youth amongst men!
It's true, Siddhu.
I went through so much trouble
to cajole that Monica aunty.
Aunty?
The neighbor's maid.
- I see.
I was serious about her.
But before I could tell her...
...she ran off with
that puncture-repairer.
Life's been so hard on us...
that we never got any girl in our life.
And see...l can't even
tell lshita...that I love her.
Veer, why are you crying?
- You're crying too.
Your brother's still alive.
I will help you.
- You will.
Yes...and you'll help me in return.
You won't tell our brothers...
...that I was the one
who stole all that stuff.
Rascal...
Sorry, but you just wait and
watch the ideas I give you now.
You won't stay bachelor any more.
In fact, no one will
stay bachelor anymore.
We'll even find a Mani-ben
for this Mani-bhai.
Well said.
Even my parents never
thought about me, but you did.
You're not human, you're definitely
some angel. Get yourself checked up.
I am there.
Veer, just see what I do now.
Just wait and watch.
What are you doing?
- What's this?
Where's Veer?
Why isn't he here yet?
Veer? Look!
He's waiting for you there.
Waiting for me?
Hi.
- Hi.
Ishita, I could never
muster the courage to say this.
But on this Christmas Eve...
...I want to convey his message to you.
Whose?
My heart..
Go ahead.
Well, normally people celebrate
Christmas with someone special.
But they are all
dying to go out with me.
But I will only go...
...with her!
I've lied to you many times.
But it's said that we should
speak only the truth on Christmas.
So the truth is I really...
I will be with you every
moment...for all my life.
Even if you look
like this years later.
Brother...please handle it.
Veer.
There's something I want to say.
Tell me
I think we should tell
our families about us.
What's the hurry, lshu?
- I mean we've just started now.
Veer...
I don't want them to
find out from someone else.
I won't like it.
We should talk to them.
Yeah.
What yeah...
I will talk to my family...
Will you be able to tell your brother, or...
- lshu.
We love each other. It's not a crime.
I'll tell brother on his face...
It's been 28 minutes...
will you say something?
All you've been saying
is ""I want to say something""...
What?
I want to share my
personal feelings with you.
Yeah.
I need some time.
- Okay, okay, take your time.
I want to celebrate my
'Suhagraat' (wedding night).
With whom?
Su...
Subhash... I want to
tell you about Subhash.
He's bringing the bumper
tomorrow...at the garage.
You took 29 minutes to say that.
Don't worry, I'll collect
the bumper from Subhash, okay?
I want to marry you.
What...
- No.
What are you saying?
I want to kiss you lip-to-lip.
Are you crazy?
What's he blabbering.
I'll tell you.
I knew he couldn't say it.
Actually, brother...
...we really love each other.
Really?
- Yes.
And I didn't want you to
find this out from someone else.
I wouldn't like it.
Raj...Veer isn't fooling
around this time..
He's found the right girl this time.
Yes, she's the right call-girl.
Oh Anwar...
I am...
- Really sorry.
Actually I would like
to meet your family.
Let me know if they're free tomorrow.
I'll come over.
- Okay.
Sir...madam will come
down in two minutes.
Would you like some tea or coffee?
No. This is fine, thank you
Okay, sir.
I am sorry,
I think you are...
After coming to know
that you're Veer's brother...
...I won't let Ishita meet Veer again.
You were mistaken, Meera.
I wanted to tell you the truth.
But until then...
you were already gone.
You only broke my trust, Kaali.
I spared your life
today for lshita's sake.
But if you come back here again,
I will kill you.
'Dear...
- Yes.'
'Dear...you've managed to convince me.'
'But...l know your
stubborn father too well.'
'He will never agree
to this relationship.'
'I will convince him.'
Fine...
...I am ready to meet them.
Thank you so much, dad.
I can tolerate anything...
but not your sad face.
Thank you.
Malik sir, what have you done?
You're going to bow down before
that Randhir for your daughter's sake.
You didn't get it, Raghav.
I can bow my head down
before my enemies for Meera...
...but I cannot kneel in front of them.
It's time to end this enmity forever.
I've often seen and heard...
...that years of friendship
one day turns into a relationship.
But Malik, this is the first time...
...when an old enmity is
turning into a relationship.
There's another way
to end the enmity, Randhir.
Kill the enemy.
Where's Meera?
You see, Kaali...
Meera loves you a lot.
She couldn't have seen
you and your father die.
Meera...Kaali and his
father have deceived us.
They have attacked us.
Dad!
Dad!
Try to understand, Meera.
Randhir Bakshi's men won't
stay quiet after what happened.
If not yourself,
then Think about lshita.
Think about how all this
will affect her when she finds out.
You're like a sister to me, Meera.
Listen to me.
Take lshita far away from here.
And start a new life.
We'll always protect you.
Meera has gone far away.
No one knows where.
But I want to see Meera at any cost.
I must tell her what happened there.
Kaali, I am not too intelligent.
But all this bloodshed
has taught me one thing.
There's no meaning to this life.
It's best if you forget
everything...and think about Veer.
Let's go together...
We'll start a new life. Right?
It's hard to believe...
...that fate's repeating
the same story 15 years later.
Seems like we're back
to square one .
Yeah, Raj.
There are many other
Countries in the world...
...other than India and Bulgaria.
But...they had to open
a hotel at this place.
All these years I
hid this truth from Veer...
...and he shouldn't find out now either.
We must stop Veer at any cost.
And anyway...Meera...
Will never agree to this relation.
But I want to know...
...what's the reason
behind your rejection.
It's a big one, that's it.
I do not want any more discussion
over this, lshu
Forget him.
But why?
What happened between
lshita's sister and you...
...that you said no.
I already told you...
you won't ask any more questions.
There's some reason.
- Brother...
Veer! There's a reason.
It's a serious matter.
- But what is the matter.
Look Sid, it's clear that...
...Raj brother knows Meera, otherwise...
...what can be the reason to say no.
Who knows about your brother's past?
- brother knows.
The answer's correct...
...but the direction is wrong.
The person who knows about
your brother's past...
...is my brother!
Peter.
Feed him something special today
and don't charge him.
Come on.
- I said I don't know.
Now go away,
I've a lot of customers to attend to.
Yogesh...are you going
to order something...
...or take this TV home.
I'll place my order in five minutes.
You definitely know something.
You must tell me today.
What?
I won't budge until you don't tell me.
Brother Shakti, please say something.
Anwar brother...please
tell us their story.
No...Anwar brother, for my sake...
please tell us.
Don't do this.
Their story?
They were thieves.
- Anwar!
Thieves?
- Thieves?
Anwar!
He means...they stole
each other's heart.
Raj and Meera had an affair.
Brother, please tell
us from the beginning. - Yes.
Your brother's real
name was never Raj. - Anwar!
He means...his real name was...
Ramlal.
Ramlal!
- Ramlal?
And he loved bashing...
He means he loved cleaning clothes.
Why?
- Because Ramlal was a washerman.
Brother was a washerman.
Then lshita's sister
must have a real name too.
Ishita's sister's real name...
P090!
'P090?
Ramlal and Pogo...
How did they meet?
- Meet...how?
One day Pogo was walking all alone...
...when some goons came after her.
That's when Ramlal
slammed them to the ground.
How can brother slam anyone...
- He was a washerman...
So he slammed them on the ground.
Then? - Then Pogo met
him every morning for tea.
Then?
- Then“.
They would meet in
the evening in toilets.
Why the toilet?
Hand pump.
- Yeah.
Because Ramlal would wash his clothes...
...at the hand pump which
was below Pogo's toilet.
If their love was so pumped up...
...then how did it turn into hatred?
Hatred...
Gold is my God.
Pogo loved diamonds,
jewels, gold and silver.
Their love story was somewhat like...
'Khana Khazana' (Cookery Show).
'Khana Khazana'...
what are you saying?
Because Ramlal could
barely manage a square meal...
...and Pogo was looking for treasure.
Then? - And one day...
tired of all the arguments...
...your brother turned
into a... 'Chakka' (Eunuch).
Brother turned into a...
'Chakka' (Eunuch)...How's this?
He means to say...
Yes, brother turned
into a... 'Chakka' (Eunuch).
Brother turned into
a... 'Chakka' (Eunuch) again.
Veer, this is why he never got married.
- You shut up.
I mean Ramlal was devastated...
...because he couldn't
fulfill Pogo's demands.
And in between those two...
'Daraar' (Void).
'Judaai' (Separation).
'Dushmani' (Enmity).
'Tashan' (Style).
Oh my, God.
""Oh my, God"" In between them?
- It's just an expression.
Don't people say ""Oh my,
God"" when someone separates.
Peter...cut-off that customer's finger.
Who keeps pressing
the remote so frequently?
Brother Shakti, I remember...
...when dad and brother used
to come meet me at the hostel...
...they always wore good clothes...
...and came in big cars, we were rich.
Because your brother was a washerman.
He used to wear his
customer's clothes.
And your dad was a mechanic.
He would drive his customer's car.
Just like you do.
You're a mechanic as well.
Go and fix cars...go on!
Go!
Brother...
Was our father a waiter or...
You get lost to...come on, get out.
Such an emotional story.
This is wrong.
- Anwar brother...
Who asked you to open your mouth?
Shakti, The children made me emotional.
Your emotion...
That's all fine,
but why didn't you two get married?
Come here.
You...take that...
so many questions.
Don't hit.
I just asked a question.
Because we didn't
want to become fathers.
See...he's still washing
everyone's clothes.
Ramlal!
Hey Ramlal?
What are you doing?
What are you two doing?
Let go of me, please...
what happened?
Brother Shakti and Anwar
told us everything about your past.
Oh... Everything?
Brother...you would use these
hands to wipe them, isn't it?
Whose?
Brother, why are you so worried?
- No, I am not worried.
You weren't a beggar.
You were a washerman.
Washerman!?
I am washerman?
Brother...we know everything
about Ramlal and Pogo.
Ramlal?
Who?
P090?
Give me this.
Now we'll do all this.
Okay.
You Go!
Okay, okay...
Bye, Ramlal.
Ramlal? Pogo? Washerman?
Raj, you said Veer should
never learn about the truth.
But I never said that
You should turn me into Ramlal.
We were Mafia, man.
- Yeah, that's right
But they just pounced
on us...made us swear too...
What else could we do?
You could've said you don't know.
Don't know.
Why don't we know?
We've been together for so long.
And Raj... even we have some honor.
Isn't it brother?
Ohh...that's why you tarnished mine.
Look at my personality,
Do I look like Ramlal from any angle?
Kaali...sorry...
Why are you getting so furious?
Because I know Veer too well.
He won't stay quiet.
He'll do something worse
than the story you just cooked up.
And who's Pogo?
P090?
My Sister's name was Pogo?
I don't believe this story.
And my sister left
your brother for money.
How can this be true?
- Ishu, I heard this...
...from one of brother's old friend.
His...brother.
It's all true.
What about us now?
Do one thing ...why don't you
two disappear for a few days.
Who knows...maybe out of worry
Ramlal and Pogo melt?
Jenny...they're not some
ice-cream that will melt.
I say that you two should
run away and get married.
No...my sister's done a lot for me.
I cannot hurt her like this.
Even I can't do this
with brother either.
Hold on.
Ishu...why didn't my brother and your
sister ever get married to someone else?
Why?
Because...they haven't
forgotten their memories...
...and their daily one-night stands.
Veer...you're talking about my sister.
Don't get into the details...
come to the point.
If they did love each other...
...then how about we
rekindle that love again?
And patch them up.
What do you say?
That can solve our problems.
- Exactly.
But how do we patch things up?
How?
Only God knows that.
Patrick, I've heard some new
restaurant has opened up in Panjim.
Yes, the owner is
some woman called Meera.
So go talk to her...and our stuff..
Dude...where's my car.
There...
Where's my car?
Patrick, it had drugs worth millions.
What?
Veer...
I got a superb idea to get
Ramlal and Pogo back together.
What?
We'll hire some goons...
...and tell them to chase Pogo.
The hero makes a dynamic entry...
...when the villains
chasing the heroine.
Villain's pack up...
...and the hero-heroine will patch-up.
What patch up?
What an ancient idea
to rekindle old love, Sid.
Veer...the oldest wine
is the most intoxicating one.
Just say yes...and then see...
I'm sure you'll say...
""What a plan"".
Who will pose as the goon?
- We'll find someone.
That's King's car.
Why are you driving
around in King's car?
I didn't know it was
King's car when I stole it.
You mean you stole it.
- That too King's car.
Exactly...what will King
do when he finds out?
So change its color...
...so I can sell it to someone in Goa.
Mani, you know I will never
help you with stolen stuff.
But the guy whose car you stole...
...I've got a score
to settle with him too.
But first we must hide
this car from brother Raj.
Tavde“.
- Yes, brother.
Hide the car...and
don't tell brother Raj.
You want me to lie to Raj sir?
How about I tell him
you've got a girl. Get lost
Pinto, come on.
I will never forget
what you two have done for me.
Look, I've said this to brother Raj...
...and I'm saying it again to you.
If there's anything I can do for you...
...just let me know.
I'll stand
by you head over heels.
Mani bhai, we do need help.
- Say it!
Okay. You need to
pretend as a goon for us.
Goon?
Brother Raj's love story is stuck.
Huh!
Hero and Heroine will patch-up...
...when you trouble
the girl as the villain.
Will you, Mani bhai.?
I can even give up
my life for brother Raj.
Name, place,
animal, thing...just name it.
Say it!
Mani bhai, just handle it.
Everything lies in your hands now.
Don't mess it up.
Look Veer, she's coming.
All the best. - All the best...
careful with the loin-cloth!
Do you want to die? Get out of the way.
Just one question.
- What?
Is there a Chintu in your home?
- No.
That's it...
Give me one chance...
and you'll get a Chintu.
What a plan.
And according to the time Raj
will be coming through any minute.
Now you'll say
""What are your intentions"".
And I'll say...
Next you'll say
""Don't come any closer"".
I'll say...
Then you'll say ""Help"".
And I'll say ""Scream"".
But no one will come to save you.
Mani's acting so well.
What a plan.
And then you'll come closer.
Yes.
And hold my hand tightly.
Yes!
That's when you'll realize...
...there's actually no one to help...
No one. No one. Correct!
You!
Me.
What are you taking out?
This is cheating.
I don't hit women.
I spare you because you're a woman.
Hit like a woman...
Why are you hitting like a man?
She's letting him have it!
He"") me!
Where are you going?
Pogo channel turned into WWF.
She smashed me up...
She smashed me up...
Even these two abandoned me.
Seriously, this is the limit guys.
Is this the way?
And who comes up with such ideas?
- He does.
Get sister in trouble...
brother will save her...
...and those two will fall in love.
That's the limit.
Have you lost your mind, Veer?
Brother...
- Veer...
And what do you guys think...
...by doing this, she ..
That relation is over.
You will gain nothing.
There's no point.
Veer...all this doesn't look good.
Don't be such a fool.
Everything is over.
How can you say that?
Brother...
firstly I am not ready to believe...
...that sister left you for money.
And even if she did...
...then why didn't
she marry someone else?
You're on the right track...
bombard him with another one.
Why didn't she make anyone
else her life-partner?
Go on. Go on.
And even brother didn't
marry anyone else, right?
Yes, why?
Even you didn't find
anyone else for yourself.
You never even went on a three
night-four day tour with some girl.
Brother Raj...only you
know what's in your heart.
But I've understood
what's in sister's heart.
Regardless of what
happened between you two...
...she still hasn't
forgotten her first love.
Veer, deliver the car.
Brother's melting.
Brother, I've another plan.
Mani bhai...
- Shut up!
I've to attend a meeting.
Wrap up everything
here and come home. Okay thanks.
Bye.
- Bye.
This car will definitely
break-down before it reaches Panjim.
And like every day,
brother will pass-by.
Ishita, something will
definitely happen today.
""Walk with me...in every lifetime.""
""Promise me...
you'll come back to me right here""
""We're one soul...
even if we're two bodies.""
""Always be mine...
don't ever say goodbye.""
""You're my dawn...
and you're my twilight.""
""You're the pain...
and you're the comfort.""
""There's only one thing
I ever pray for in my mind.""
""Always be mine...
don't ever say goodbye.""
""Always be mine...
don't ever say...
""Both my world lie in your arms.""
""My heaven is wherever you are.""
""Desire's are burning
in both our hearts.""
""I wish my prayers
are never unanswered.""
""You're my desire, I am your love.""
""You're my poem...l am your music.""
""You...You...
You're the one I crave for.""
""Become the intoxication in my veins
and keep flowing.
""Repay my love in this way.""
""Always be mine...
don't ever say goodbye.""
n---goodbye-n
Veer, superb buddy.
You've done an amazing job.
You completely changed
the look of the car.
Even King can never recognize it.
Veer, what's wrong?
Why are you in a bad mood?
No matter how hard we try...
...Pogo and brother's
love story doesn't pick up.
I don't know what to do now.
Veer...l do have an idea.
No more idea. No, buddy no..
- It's sure shot, please.
At least hear me out. Hear me out.
What if we rekindle their passion?
Passion? How?
There's a new film playing
in Edward's Theatre.
Let's buy corner
seat tickets for them.
They'll watch the film together...
...and rekindle their passion.
What film? - 'Tamboo Mein Dhoom-Dham'
(Indian C-grade film).
Come here. Come here.
You and your pervert ideas.
Pinto, wrap the boot.
It's a nice film. I've seen it myself.
Brother, there's a bag in here.
Whose bag is this?
I guess it Mani bhai's.
This isn't my bag.
- What?
Then whose bag is it?
- I don't know.
Open it.
Oh God...drugs!
Drugs! This is
definitely King's stuff.
What do we do with it now?
If these drugs get out in the market...
...there's no telling how
many will fall prey to it.
Then what do we do it.
Let's burn it.
These drugs were going
to ruin the entire youth.
King...l really enjoyed
burning your stuff.
I think Mani bhai is drunk.
- Drunk?
He's completely over the top.
Mani bhai, control.
- What control?
Lose control!
Lose control!
What..
King!
King!
What are you guys burning?
What are you guys burning tell me?
We're burning the stuff from the car.
- What?
You see...once a month...
...we burn all the scrap
from the garage in a bonfire.
Sir...what are you doing here?
My car's broken down.
- We'll fix it.
Yeah...
- Ignition.
What?
Why are you laughing?
He's warming his hands
on the ashes of his own stuff.
Shut up, Mani. You'll give us away.
Veer...he's gone.
Fix it quickly.
King...you're looking really smart.
Thank you.
But you would look smarter...
...with your father's favorite car.
Did you find the car?
You didn't, right?
King, don't mind...he's drunk.
Mani...
King...was there something in the car?
You didn't find that either, did you?
Hey...show some manners.
He's King.
King...is my Angel.
King...
...did you find Kaali?
You didn't find him either.
King...your car's fixed.
Come on.
Mani, what are you doing?
Why do you drink so much?
Veer...Siddhu!
Did Ramlal and Pogo patch up?
They didn't either?
Get out!
We...work for King!
I said get out.
Joshua...that's Kaali!
What's the matter, Veer?
These days you've been
visiting the church quite often.
How did you get so religious?
Yes, brother.
There are only two things
in our life that matters.
Car...and Sans-kar (Values).
Nice church, right?
Brother, I'll go get the candles.
Wait here,
sis...I'll go get the candles.
Are you following me?
I came here with Veer.
Where is he?
Raj my boy, you here.
And Joshua told me...
that you're Meera.
Let me introduce myself.
I am King... Charmed.
It's a good thing we met...
I was thinking of
coming over to meet you.
Last night my men came to your shack...
...and suddenly Kaali dropped in.
Do you know Kaali?
Because if you do...then tell me.
And I promise you my men
will never trouble you again.
Of course, will finish him.
Do you know Kaali?
I don't know him!
Just once I lay my hand on Kaali...
You know what...I'll pray to
the Lord that you never find Kaali.
Who knows...what will happen...
To him...not you.
Yeah...Got to go, bro.
- Have a good day.
Oh my...
Veer...you did an amazing job.
You turned a landline
into a smartphone...
...and an old piece
of junk into Iron Man.
You turned bat into Batman...
...and Spider into Spider' Man.
Oh my...
Blackberry at the bottom...
and Bappi Lahiri on top.
I'll sell this at
the rate of an airplane.
By the way...what's the
rate of airplanes nowadays?
Forget about airplanes
and just go sell this thing.
This is King's car.
If he finds out...
- Then you'll disappear forever.
Oh... Correct.
Bravo my boy.
Keep this...Lux cozy...
Rupa's underwear.
Underwear.
Oscar bhai,
you look really happy today.
What's the matter?
Bloody raincoat...l could've given
you any amount you had asked for.
Why?
Because my sister just told me...
...that she's in love with some boy.
Some boy...who owns a hotel.
Ariel...and Harpic.
Yeah!
Tomorrow I am going to talk to his
family about their marriage.
And if it's fixed...
...then I am thinking
of presenting this...
...on their wedding.
Hold a second.
Should I present a gift?
Or gift a present?
It's the same thing, Oscar bhai.
A gift is a gift after all...
Wow...you read my heart.
Mani you're just a honey.
Jenny's here, Siddhu.
Jenny?
Hi, hi...
- What's up, Jenny?
Jenny, you here?
You could've called.
Guess what?
- What?
I told my brother everything about us.
And he's agreed to our marriage.
- What?
In fact, he's come here to meet you.
What are you saying, Jenny?
Why are you still standing?
Where is he standing?
Brother-in-law.
- Siddhu.
Where are you brother-in-law?
Mona Lisa...
Oscar bhai.
What are you doing?
- What are you doing here?
I'm here to meet
my sister's boyfriend.
And I am here to meet
my girlfriend's brother.
Where is he? Introduce me?
He's the one.
It's him.
You?
_ You?
I guess you two know each other
from before.
They know each other too well.
In and out.
Everything that he took
out...he would take in. Right?
In and out.
What are you saying?
Sister, I'll tell you.
This guy's a down-market thief.
Bloody fool...Colgate.. babul.
Thief.
Siddhu, you're a thief.
Well...your brother's a thief too.
And he's got a shop at the flea-market.
- Brother.
He used to buy all the goods I stole.
Forget your girlfriend's brother...
Your brother's coming.
- Brother...
Stop him. He'll go berserk.
Brother...brother...
Shakti, please don't...
Did I starve him?
So what was the reason...
Brother, this girl...
This girl is the reason, brother.
Brother, in this era you can ask
any youth like me...
...and he'll tell
you that finding love...
...has become so expensive and hard.
I mean...if we go watch a film
in the multiplex, that's 800 rupees.
And if you eat a combo
of popcorn and fritters...
...then it's 900 rupees.
And after that if your
baby says ""Baby, coffee""...
...then treating her to coffee
costs almost 1000 rupees.
And all night on your
prepaid card, we do...
""Hello...baby, sweety, love you...""
Then where the 2000 rupees go,
no one knows.
And...gift on her birthday.
Gift on Valentine's Day.
""And baby...we met for
the first time on Friday.""
Then every Friday...
there's a weekly anniversary gift.
I mean like...really...
So many expenses?
- You don't know.
Brother...your era
was completely different.
Your date would mean
eating corncobs and having tea...
...and cozying up behind stones.
But the girls these days
are very high maintenance.
Ask us...
We've to pay weekly at multiplexes,
coffee shops...
...and malls to prove our love.
It is not that easy.
It's bloody extortion.
Siddhu...
Relax, Siddhu...
or you'll blow a nerve.
Wait, I'll handle him now.
Siddhu .. we didn't know you were
going through so many troubles.
It's so expensive.
Shakti, the poor boy's
stuck between love and expenses.
Puraskar bhai..
- Oscar bhai.
It's the same thing.
You're an award after all.
Siddhu's a nice guy.
- Yeah.
For me, Siddhu is just like Veer.
Oscar bhai, he's my brother.
We're a descent family.
No criminal records.
Forget that,
he loves your sister so much.
He's well to do.
The café, garage, property...
It will all belong
to these two after us.
Please, say yes.
- But how can I say yes.
Why not?
Why not?
You two are already
a match made in heaven.
Us?
You two are sailing in the same boat.
Don't feel embarrassed.
Feel proud of him.
But...
Brother, please say yes.
- Come on, say yes.
Okay...l agree to this marriage...
Jackie Shroff lookalike.
But I have a condition.
Is someone going to ask what?
- What?
The marriage takes
place in a church.
What are you saying?
Everyone agreed to Siddhu
and Jenny's marriage.
That's great news.
Their family said yes...
...I wonder when will
our family say yes.
Don't worry,
Veer...they will say yes.
Tell Siddhu we want a party.
Let's all meet and celebrate.
What say?
Yeah, okay. Cool
- Bye.
I told you...not to keep
any kind of relation with them.
Sis...
Sis...you've a problem
with that family. Not me.
And you're not telling
me what that problem is either.
I don't understand
why you're doing this, sis.
After mom and dad passed away...
...I've always fulfilled
all your wishes and wants
And never asked why.
I even let you take
your own decisions.
And never asked why.
So today, for the first time, when
I am stopping you from something...
...can't you do this much for me?
Fine, sis...I'll do everything you say.
I'll never ask anything, I promise.
But if not Veer...
...then there won't be
anyone else in my life.
Ishita...
Call Veer home tomorrow.
I want to talk to him.
- You mean...
Ask him to come alone.
Thank you, Pogo... Ma'am.
Sorry...!
Brother will be really
happy to know that you said yes.
But now you must accept
one of my condition!
Done.
I mean...whatever it is, I agree.
You can say it for formality,
but done.
After the marriage,
you must live here.
If you want to be with lshita...
you must leave your brother.
Sis...what are you saying?
Are you joking?
Ishu...this is a big issue.
Meera's asking me
to leave my brother.
See, I really love you...
but he isn't just my brother.
He's my father,
mother, friend...everything.
All his life he has only
cared about my happiness.
And she wants...
Sorry madam...you might
own a restaurant.
But this is not some
home-delivery or take-away.
Ishita, I am sorry.
But nothing is more
important than a brother.
Not even you.
Veer!
You're leaving her
for that brother of yours.
He isn't even your blood brother.
Your dad picked him
up from the streets.
Ishita...
You don't believe me.
Ask him yourself.
Enough!
Where were you Veer?
I've been asking around for you.
Come, let's eat...
What happened?
I wanted to ask you something.
- Ask. Why are you standing like that?
Is there something you've ever hidden
from me?
What could I ever hide from you?
No! There's nothing
I have hidden from you.
You're not my blood brother.
Who told you that?
- lshita's sister.
Why are you quiet?
Just tell me, you have my swear
It's true that I am not
your blood brother.
It's a different thing that
I love you more than a blood brother.
And it's true that
I hid this fact from you.
It's a different thing...
I didn't want to lose you.
Ishita's sister has a
condition for our marriage.
That I should leave you.
So...what did you say?
Get lost...
I left lshita, brother.
Brother...I'll find someone else.
But first I'll make sure that
she doesn't have an elder sister.
Don't forget to check.
Who knows...
I might have an affair...
...with every beautiful
girl's elder sister.
You bluntly said no?
Do you really love me so much?
Don't just stand there,
come here.
What did you want to do?
You wanted to separate two brothers.
Did it pain that much?
The very thought of separating
from your kin was painful.
Think about what I went
though...when you killed my dad.
Did you think about it..
- I didn't kill your dad.
You're lying.
- It's true!
It's true ! Look into my eyes.
I swear on my brother that
I didn't kill your father.
Look into my eyes Meera...
this is the truth.
We were the ones who were betrayed.
Us.
And if you still don't believe me,
then take this...
...and end this matter right now.
Shoot, Meera. Shoot.
I won't survive from
this close, Meera.

Malik sir was the
one who betrayed them.
Whatever Kaali said is true.
Raghav, why didn't
you tell me this before?
I couldn't
go against Malik sir.
And I didn't want
a daughter to find out...
...what her father has done.
You don't know what you've done.
You don't know what you've done.
You love your brother a lot,
don't you?
Yes!
And my lshita too.
Then marry her and stay here.
With your brother.
What?
You mean...l won't die a bachelor.
I'll get married too.
I'll go on a honeymoon too.
- Veer.
I mean...would you like some tea.
You must have tea.
I suggest that you have
breakfast instead, Pogo.
Ishita, come.
We'll go to the kitchen and make tea.
Come...
Brother, don't just stand there...
Pogo's come home for the first time.
Show her the garage,
the house, the sofa...
Come on, brother.
Nice house.
It's new.
Thank you.
That's...our garage.
We modify car...
Designing... styling...
Fiber...the works...
You always loved cars.
That's Anwar and Shakti.
Remember?
Now they run a café.
Still multi-talented I guess.
Raghav told me the truth.
That's true.
You haven't changed at all.
- Except for a little beard.
Actually...you haven't changed either.
Maybe I've put on a little weight.
- Yes, a little...
I...l didn't mean that.
You...do look fine, same like before.
Really?
<i>""</i> No!
Only a little.
I am sorry.
It's been 15 years Kaali.
15 years...
4 months...
10 days!
The rest of the garage's ours too.
Engineering department...AutoCAD...
The whole...
I am so sorry!
I am so sorry!
I thought what I saw was the truth.
I didn't give you a chance to explain.
I didn't believe you.
I wanted to tell you, Meera.
But you were already gone. And...
I came here.
But you know what...
Let's forget all this now.
We...we don't need to look back now.
But it was entirely my fault.
I can't...
It wasn't your fault...nor mine.
The circumstances were to be blamed.
Meera, I...
- I
Good morning, Raj bhai.
Here comes the wedding
days...Kurkure and Lays (Wafers).
Come with me...
The wedding procession is coming.
Raj bhai, let's go.
- Where?
To make the wedding guest list.
If I make one, only thieves
and criminals will come.
And they'll even steal the cutlery.
Raj bhai...who is she?
Your wife?
- No..
No no, you're not married yet.
Your girlfriend.
- No...
No...you don't have a girlfriend either.
What?
After seeing the wedding procession. Are you
dreaming of Becoming a groom as well.
What are you saying? What are you doing?
- Speak up naughty fellow.
Come on, let's go and talk there.
Okay.
By the way, I am Oscar.
What do I call her?
Can I call her sister-in-law?
""Walk with me...in every lifetime.""
""Promise me...
you'll come back to me right here""
""We're one soul...
even if we're two bodies.""
""Always be mine...
don't ever say goodbye.""
Pogo, thank you.
Now even I can get
married because of you.
I did nothing.
When there's love...then
you should get married.
Then why didn't you get married yet.
There's a reason, I can't tell you.
But can I tell you something?
When I came here with
Siddhu to book this place...
...I got a wonderful news.
Even if you hold two weddings here,
the price of the hall is still same.
And...the expenses for decorator
and caterer is also the same.
Very enticing.
But tell me one thing...
Does my face tell you I am a miser?
No.
That's not it.
But there has to be some excuse...
...to take things forward.
Look.
They look so happy.
Yes, they are.
Soon Ishita and Veer
will get married too.
You will miss lshita a lot.
A lot.
Actually you can come
home everyday to meet lshita.
In fact, I can even
pick you up from the shack.
You can have dinner with us.
Nowadays I even cook well.
Really?
- Really.
So taxi, catering,
escort service...whatever.
Wow!
But...pickup and drop every day.
I must think of another
way to meet lshita every day.
Actually, I do have a way.
What?
Can you meet me for
five minutes tomorrow?
Huh?
I'll think about it.
This is my car.
Open the boot!
Joshua...who is the man here,
claiming this car to be his car?
You.
You only said it...
Go and bring that guy.
Yes, sir.
Whiter than white...
that's Oscar family.
Where are you taking me?
Is there less salt in the food.
Hail Mother Mary.
When asked,
He said that he owns the car.
Yeah...
When the dog's about the die...
...the Thakur's manager says,
""Thakur's dead"".
That's nothing original.
It's a dialogue from
Karan-Arjun (Bollywood film).
Maybe you don't know who I am.
I am King. King.
So do you want me to make your
adhaar card, son of burger king.
This car...
Don't even dream about this car.
I won't sell it at any cost.
And anyway, Oscar never
deals with the likes of you.
Have your food and leave quietly.
Forgive me...it's not my fault.
Mani stole this car
and brought it to me.
When the dog's about the die...
...the neighboring puppy
eyes his young widow.
How nice, sir...
Neighboring puppy...
young widow
What a message.
Where's everyone?
Hello...one, two, three, four...
Widow... puppy..-
Everyone's right here, Mani.
Just that...my right and your
left indicator is switched on, son
Mani...there were drugs
worth millions in the boot!
Veer found those packets.
I don't know what he did with it.
Ask him and he'll tell you.
Hello.
Get Veer!
What's all this, King?
Why bring me here like this?
When the dog's about the die...
Joshua, I am out of stock.
Have you got anything?
I have with a cat.
- Shut up!
Mani bhai. Oscar bhai, why are you both
looking in the opposite directions?
Are you angry with each other?
No, they were being stiff with me.
So...l stiffened their neck.
King, you're crossing your limits.
I am.
Because back in college...
...Seema and Rekha didn't
let me cross my limits.
It happens with everyone, King.
Don't get emotional.
What did you do with my drugs, Veer?
Whatever I did,
you were involved in it too?
Meaning?
Your drugs were burning
in the same bonfire...
...where you were keeping
your hands warm.
I kept asking you
""Was there something in the car"".
Hello, One, two, three, four...
Are you crazy?
You burned away drugs worth millions.
Veer. Veer.
Kaali!
We know the truth, sis.
Brother told us everything.
Don't worry.
Yeah...you were right
and brother was wrong.
You left him because...
...brother turned from washer man Ramlal
into Kaali for money.
And you didn't want his
bad influence on my upbringing.
So you...
Pogo, please rest. Would
you like some juice? I'll go get it.
Have an apple too.
Come lshu come.
Brother..
- Yeah...got it.
Why didn't you tell them the truth?
Because we shouldn't
tell them in the first place.
What's the point, Meera?
The enmity between our dads...
Killing each other... Why?
Actually,
we should all start afresh.
And no one needs to look back.
But why did you prove yourself wrong,
and me right?
You see...
In big countries...
these small things often happen...

Dr. Romesh Sharma is a young medical intern who dares to dream. He is in awe of Dr. Viren Asthana, the Chief Surgeon of the Shekhawat General Hospital. All he wants is to be like him. He lives with Dr. Riya Srivastava, his co-intern and the love of his life.

However, when an eight-year-old boy, Ankur Arora (Vishesh Tiwari), dies due to Dr. Asthana's medical negligence, Romesh realises that a good surgeon is not necessarily a good person.

Together with Ankur's mother, Nandita Arora, Nandita's friend, Ajay Shetty, their lawyer, Kajori Sen, and Dr. Romesh, they set out on a turbulent journey to fight for what is right. A fight for justice against his mentor, the hospital, and the love of his life, who is initially against him for the fear of ruining her career and future. It is revealed that Kajori is in a relationship with her opposing lawyer, who tells her to keep the case hanging and only blame the hospital overall, not Dr. Asthana specifically. She does the same in the court but soon finds that she is pregnant with his child. As she informs him, he orders her to abort the baby. Romesh spots them together, and with Nandita, he goes to her house, only to find her lying ill due to the abortion pill. They take her to the hospital, and she promises them that she will fight for Ankur. It turns out that all the necessary evidence against Dr. Viren Asthana is destroyed or literally snatched. Dr. Riya, who witnesses the operation, and Rosina D'Costa (Khushboo Kamal), a ward nurse in the hospital who had informed Dr. Asthana about Ankur eating some biscuits before the operation, also lie in court. The next day Riya goes to Dr. Viren Asthana to sign for leave. She tells him that she lied and cheated with the credibility of her profession, and her self-respect is questioning her. A heated argument between her and Dr. Asthana follows in which Dr. Asthana labels himself as the god who should be forgiven for the mistake he has done. It is revealed in the hospital the next day that Riya had actually shot the confession outburst by Dr. Viren Asthana on her mobile and presented it to the court. The case ends in their favour, and Dr. Viren Asthana gets arrested. In the last scene, Romesh and Riya reunite, and Nandita is shown remembering her memories with Ankur.",2292,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt2912578.srt","O Lord Ganesha,

Sir, who is this celebrity patient?
The entire media has
gathered here to cover his news.
He is Laxman Gagal.
- Gagal?
Gagal who is one of
top 100 business tycoons?
Yes.
What has happened to him?
- Accident.
What the hell is happening here?
This is not a Goddamn circus!
Move back!
- Get OR2 prepped up.
Dr. Riya.
- Yes, sir.
You will be with the patient,
Dr. Romesh. - Sir.
Hi, doctor. My name is Amit Gagal.
That's my father.
Amit Gagal, there are three things.
Keep your family away from me.
Don't ask me about
the patient's wellbeing repeatedly.
I will get irritated.
And thirdly, I am the best.
No one can save your
father besides me.
Is that clear? Out.
Nurse.
Sir, the heart rate is going down.
Sir, it has dropped to 60.
BP is low?
- Sir, it's 90.
Nurse, get me the drip fast.
Doctor, he is sinking.
- Just five minutes. I am almost done.
Sir, heart rate has dropped to 40.
Intracardiac adrenaline, Dr. Romesh.
Here, sir.
Nurse, quickly.
Sir.
- Jab it between third and fourth rib.
Sir, straight in the heart?
Jab it now. We are
losing him. Come on.
What are you thinking?
Jab it now. Come on.
Jab it..
Who allowed you in
the operation theatre? Damn it.
Give it to me. Get out.
Oh, God! His BP has gone down to 55.
Atropine 100.
His BP is going down, doctor.
His BP is going down.
Atropine, one ampoule, nurse. Now.
Quick, nurse.
Heart rate is down to 20, sir.
Pulse is down. Doctor, Bradycardia.
Nurse, give it to me.
Charge to 200.
Charged.
Sir! Sir! Sir!
Hold on! Hold on!
- How is he, sir?
Mr. Gagal had multiple rib
fractures and ruptured spleen.
The operation was successful.
He is in the ICU.
Under observation.
He will be alright soon. Thank you.
- Sir, when will Mr. Gagal..
..be able to resume his normal life?
- Sir! Sir! Sir!
Sir, for how long will
he be in the hospital?
Sir! Sir, I am very sorry about
what happened in the OT today.
Stay in the ICU with Mr. Gagal.
If there is any emergency,
press the code blue button.
Yes, sir.
You couldn't jab an injection.
I hope you will be
able to press a button.
Sir, I am..
Hey, you!
You have still not gone to sleep?
It's 6:30 in the morning.
It's 11 in Sidney.
It's a live match. How can I sleep?
How come you are
suddenly interested in cricket?
Some cute new cricketer?
Just you.
It's okay.
I know that you are
upset that I am upset. But...
What Dr. Asthana said was right.
I did freeze.
I don't know what had happened to me.
It's okay. It happens.
It was our first surgery.
And...in this situation many
experienced doctors also tremble.
That's why we are interns.
So that we can face such kind
of situations and pressures.
As it is, it's not easy to jab
an injection into someone's lungs.
Especially if he is
a famous celebrity.
It means, I am a good
human being and a bad doctor.
Only a good human
being can be a good doctor.
By the way, a good
human being, a good doctor.

He doesn't need any introduction.
He is as important for us
as Sachin is for cricket.
Hi. - If Dr. Asthana
had not been with us..
..we wouldn't have got funds
for the new pediatric ward.
Now I would like Dr.
Asthana to say a few words.
What do I say?
He has made me Tendulkar.
But he is also as
important for our hospital..
..as BCCI is for our
Indian cricket team.
We can neither live with
him nor live without him.
Yes?
Hello.
- Hi, doctor.
Doctor, this is my son Ankur.
Since last night he
has a severe stomachache.
I don't know what it is.
Come, son. Come here.
Come.
Sit.
Any vomiting?
No. He didn't vomit.
He said he feels like vomiting.
But he didn't vomit.
- Okay.
I gave him a painkiller.
But it didn't make any difference.
- Okay.
Mrs..
- Nandita. You can call me Nandita.
Nandita, I can't be sure just now.
But this could be appendicitis.
I think it might be better
if you admit him for tonight.
But doctor, how come
suddenly appendicitis?
I mean.. - No. No. No.
This is not a serious situation.
It's a very common problem.
Actually, appendix is
that part of our body..
..without which we
can easily function.
For instance, tonsils.
We call it vestigial organs.
Like a tail?
- Yeah. Like a tail.
The only problem is that
for 100% confirmation..
..we will have to get
his sonography done.
And that's possible
only tomorrow morning.
So I think its better that you
let him stay here for tonight.
Because if he is in pain at home..
..it will just get difficult.
Fine.
I will get him admitted.
- Okay. Very good.
Don't be scared.
Excuse me.
- Yes, sir.
Ankur Arora is in which room?
On the second floor, room number 201.
- Thank you.
Welcome.
What are you doing here? - The question
is what are you doing here?
What the hell is happening?
And suddenly, what happened to Ankur?
The doctor thinks it is appendicitis.
He said to admit him. Or else
there might be some complication.
So I got him admitted.
Good. But you didn't
call me up. That's not good.
I would have come with you.
- Actually, it was very late.
I didn't want to disturb you.
Now you are being really formal.
You are not just my employee,
but also my friend.
You should have called me up.
You know, I am always there for you.
Sit.
Sandwich.
I am not hungry.
- Eat.
Look, eat. Otherwise acidity and
all that nonsense will happen.
Along with the kid, we will
have to admit the mother too.
Do you know? Since morning he was
telling me he has a stomachache.
I thought he was making an excuse..
..so that he doesn't
have to go to school.
I am so stupid.
So stupid.
Ankur.
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.
You kept telling me the whole day.
I couldn't understand.
You must have been in
a lot of pain, right?
You were in pain, weren't you?
Mama is so stupid.
Mama, don't worry. I am okay.
It's not paining now. I am fine, mom.
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.
Who is the next patient?
- Ankur Arora, sir.
Good morning, doctor.
My name is Nandita Arora. And..
Who admitted him?
- Me, sir.
The patient was in pain
and complaining of nausea.
I had a doubt it is appendicitis.
So I thought it's better to admit him.
Did you do sonography?
- No, sir.
So how do you know its appendicitis?
It could be ureteric stones.
Sir, he was complaining
of stomachache. So I..
It could be intussusception.
Sir, there was no
complaint of blood in the stool.
And the pain was also not severe.
Viral gastroenteritis.
Sir, there was no fever.
And no diarrhea also.
Your diagnosis is right.
Your decision of
admitting him is also right.
Get CT scan done.
We will know the level of infection.
Yes, sir.
- Are you his mother?
You shouldn't ignore appendicitis.
It's not good.
We might have to operate him
once we get the scan reports.
The OT is not available today.
So the operation will
take place tomorrow.
As such, the pain is less.
So, no problem.
Whatever you think
is fine. And if you..
Sir, actually, OT is available today.
OT is not available today.
No, sir. There was a
gallbladder surgery.
It has been canceled. So..
- OT is not available today.
The operation will
take place tomorrow.
Don't you do that to me ever again.
Don't try to cut me off in front
of my patient. - Sir, I was just..
When I am saying OT is not available..
..it means OT is not available.
Sir, I was informed that the
surgery has been cancelled.
So I thought of informing you.
- Dr. Romesh.
I know the surgery has been cancelled.
I know OT is available.
But the kid will stay
here tonight. You know why?
Because I am saying it.
Simple.
If you want to be a
successful doctor, remember that..
..along with being a profession,
it's a business too.
You need money for treatment.
These modern machines,
medicines, staff..
..hasn't come free.
It has been bought with money.
To run the hospital you need
money and not just goodness.
Without money, there
will be no hospitals.
Without hospital, no treatment.
If you sympathize
with them, tell them..
..to stop going to expensive
beauty parlors for a month.
They will save money.
If she can't even do
this for her son..
..then she shouldn't
expect anything from us.
One patient's money comes
to another patient's aid.
So they bloody well
pay for each other.
Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.
Do you understand, Dr. Romesh?
I am asking you, Dr. Romesh.
Do you understand?
Sir, we understand. We all understand.
What you are saying makes sense.
Try to understand.
Learn something from her.
Take it easy.
Hey, champ. You okay in there?
Yeah. Okay.
I am not scared.
Good.
Shall I ask you a question?
Sure. - Can people die
during asendipitis operation?
Its not asendipitis.
It's appendicitis.
And, no. No one dies
in this operation.
They just survive.
And we won't let you die.
Are you sure?
- Very sure.
Is it just appendix?
Or any other complication?
Only appendicitis.
But if you and Dr. Asthana want..
..we can conduct many more tests.
So that this hospital can do business.
Romesh, I was just..
- You understand everything.
I am getting bored.
For how long will I have to lie down?
Just 10 minutes more, champ.
Shall I tell you something?
But don't tell mom.
Sure. I am an expert
in keeping secrets.
You see, I don't feel
good that I am sick.
Because mom is sad because of me.
She was already sad.
And...and she is sadder now.
Don't worry. You will be fine.
She thinks I don't know anything.
I am a kid.
But I am not a kid.
I know papa has left us forever.
I even know that mom
doesn't cry in front of me.
She cries alone in her bedroom.
Make me alright. I will earn a
lot of money once I grow up.
Only for mom.
I will buy many presents for her.
I will always keep her happy.
I won't leave her like papa.
Romesh, it's not fair.
You are venting out
Asthana's anger on me.
I was just easing the tension
between Dr. Asthana and you.
That's all. It was really
getting out of control.
Do you know, Riya?
When I was small,
my mother used to tell me..
..when a person's courage wanes..
..he becomes more cunning.
And when I was small,
my mother had also told me.
Instead of unnecessary bravery,
it's better to keep quiet.
Fight only when you can fight.
Not when you don't
have the power to fight.
Tomorrow, Dr. Asthana
won't let me come in the OT..
..for Ankur's operation.
Take care of the kid.
Please.
I will.
And now, will you
break your oath of silence?
I love you.
That's the problem.
I love you too.
Mama...I am hungry.
You can't eat now, Ankur.
Your operation is after an hour, son.
Come on. Be a brave boy.
Eat later.
You are mama's brave boy.
Okay?
Good morning, Ankur.
- Hi.
Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.
Ma'am, this is a list
for the surgical kit.
You have to buy it
from the surgical shop.
The unused items will be returned.
Will you get it if I pay you money?
We don't have anyone else here.
I am sorry, ma'am.
Actually, the hospital staff
is not allowed to take money.
And I think it won't take you long.
The shop is not crowded in
the morning. That's why.
Bye, Ankur. Thank you, ma'am.
- Bye.
You will be okay?
I will get it and be back soon.
Send your Gina that yap yap thing.
Whatsapp, mom.
Whatsapp.
Okay. I got it.
Whatsapp.
- Whatsapp.
Carefully. Careful. Careful.
You are not scared, are you?
- No, mom.
The doctors will take care of you.
And uncle Ajay will take care of you.
Naughty. - Of course I will.
And that's a promise.
Stop it.
Bye, mom.
- Bye, son.
See you, champ.
Good morning, Ankur.
Your stomach is empty, right?
You didn't eat anything
in the morning, did you?
No.
- Very good.
Nurse, take this.
Nurse.
Actually, when mom went down,
I was very hungry.
So I ate a few biscuits.
Don't tell mom.
Or else she will be very angry.
Excuse me, sir.
- Yes. It's a black diamond, sir..
Sir, the appendicitis
patient Ankur Arora.. - What?
He is not MBM, sir.
- What?
Sir, that patient Ankur Arora..
..ate a few biscuits. Sir,
his stomach is not empty.
I can't postpone the operation
because of a few biscuits, Rosina.
There is a queue for operations.
But sir, the operation is
scheduled within an hour. - Yes..
So I will use ryles tube.
Why is that used?
Sir, to clear the patient's
stomach before the operation.
Exactly. It will be done. Now go.
Yes. No. My wife is not coming.
You can introduce me to anybody.
Of course.
Okay. Yeah. It's okay. Bye.
- Excuse me, ma'am.
Yes? - Sir, this is
standard disclaimer form.
A routine operation formality.
So ma'am has to sign here.
Just sign here.
We are ready, sir.
- Good.
Is everything okay, sir?
I am forgetting something.
I had to do something. What was that?
Damn! My phone.
Remove it.
Switch it off.
- Sir.
Scalpel please.
Dr. Romesh.
What are you doing here?
I thought you would be in the surgery.
No. Actually,
I am just an intern here.
Dr. Asthana is
conducting the operation.
So nothing to worry about.
He is the best.
A good stitch, sir.
Thank you, Dr. Riya.
Thank you very much everybody.
Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir.
Doctor.
- Hello.
Ankur?
- Yes. He is alright.
He will regain consciousness soon.
Thank you.. - I have got the
email for the Geneva convention.
I will reply in two days.
Ankur, show me your tongue.
Show me your tongue.
Yes. Good.
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes. This too. Good boy.
Okay. Fine. Okay.
Oh, my God!
He is vomiting. He is aspirating.
Oh, God! Nurse,
suction machine. Quick.
Yes, sir.
Sir, his oxygen
saturation is dropping.
Oh, God! Quickly, nurse.
Nurse, call Dr. Asthana immediately.
- Yes, doctor.
Doctor. Dr. Asthana.
- Hold on.
Keep him under observation for two
more days. - Okay, sir. - Doctor.
Appendicitis patient
is aspirating in the OT.
Damn! Ryles tube! Damn!
I cannot see anything.
Give me the tool.
Okay.
Hold it. Oh, no! It is a mess.
What's going on?
- He aspirated, doctor.
Why didn't anyone tell me that he
ate something before the operation?
Intubator. - There is a lot of vomit.
Let me clean this first.
Sir, oxygen saturation is down to 60.
Just intubate him.
The oxygen is not reaching his brain.
Nurse, quick. Get the tube.
Give me the tube.
- Sir, oxygen saturation is down to 50.
I cannot see anything.
There is food all over.
You are not doing this
for the first time, doctor.
You have done this a thousand times.
Now don't disappoint me. Please.
I cannot see any damn thing, doctor.
Damn! Telescope.
Ventilator.
Saturation is down.
It's in. It's in.
The tube is in esophagus
and not in the trachea.
There is no way,
doctor. Come on. Take it out.
Oh, God!
- Saturation down to 35.
It's in the trachea now.
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.
His reading, Dr. Riya?
Saturation is 110. Improving.
It's going up, sir.
Just check him please.
- What?
Just check the boy.
Ankur.
Ankur, open your eyes.
Ankur. Ankur, can you hear me?
Open your eyes, Ankur.
Ankur, open your eyes. Open your eyes.
Ankur, can you hear me? Ankur,
open your eyes.
Ankur, open your eyes. Ankur. Ankur.
He is not responding.
We have lost him.
- What?
He is in hypoxia.
He is in coma?
I messed up.
For the first time in
life...I have messed up.
What happened, doctor?
Rosina told me the
patient...ate a few biscuits..
..before the operation.
What!
I had to use Ryle's tube.
I forgot.
Damn!
Look...we are all doctors.
So...doctors support each other.
Whatever happened in the
operation theatre will remain here.
But, doctor..
- It's not just...my mistake...doctor.
You should have also checked.
But..
- Okay. Okay.
Whatever
happened...won't be disclosed.
Is that clear?
But Dr. Asthana, if someone asks us..
..how did the child slip into coma..
..why have we kept him on ventilator,
what will we say?
Yes. So...we will say
postoperative atelectasis.
His lung collapsed.
He couldn't breathe
during the operation.
His lung was collapsing. So we...
..kept him on ventilator.
But still he slipped into coma.
We can say that. We are doctors.
But..
You guys have to decide
whether you are with me or..
Because if you are not
with me, you are against me.
And after that your degrees,
experience, influence..
..won't come in handy.
You know that very well, doctor.
At least not in this country.
Nobody can touch me.
So don't look at me
like I am some criminal.
Okay? So it's clear. Okay? It's done.
You can leave please.
Riya, wait. No. You can go.
Inform his family.
Okay?
Do as I said.
Is that clear?
First let him be
discharged from the hospital.
I have no idea.
We will go. We will go. Okay, then..
I am not sure. Yes.
Maybe about a week.
Fine.
Yes.
I know you would love that.
Yes. Yes, doctor?
There is a complication.
- Complication?
Your son, after the
operation his lungs collapsed.
What?
- It doesn't usually happen.
But it's a rare case.
After the operation,
oxygen didn't reach his brain.
And he has slipped into coma.
We have kept him on ventilator.
And we are giving him antibiotics.
And we are shifting him to ICU soon.
Usually in such cases,
the patient comes out of coma..
..in a day or two.
Please don't worry.
Ankur is this
hospital's responsibility.
Just..
What is this? You
forgot the bag in the car?
Lalita..
- His mother..
How was it?
Coffee?
Here.
- Thanks.
What happened, Riya?
What happened? Is something wrong?
Riya, what's happened?
What?
- I don't feel good.
But, Riya..
He is in coma.
Because of lung collapse.
That's what the doctors are saying.
They will give him
strong antibiotics..
..shift him to ICU.
How did this happen?
Such a small kid is in coma.
Doctor, how serious is this?
It's serious.
Ajay!
- Yeah!
Ajay, I have read
Smith & Morison's contract.
Talk to them once. I think it is fine.
Read it once and then talk. Okay?
Talk to them. What are you doing?
You haven't slept since 24 hours.
Please go home and rest.
I am here with Ankur.
I will take care of him.
How will you take care?
How can you take care?
What does he want?
He doesn't need anything.
He can't ask for anything,
neither can he eat nor drink.
He doesn't need anything. He doesn't.
Neither friends nor mother.
Nandita, come on.
What are you doing? There is
a lot of office work pending.
So what if he is ill?
What can someone do?
What can someone do?
Life doesn't stop.
It goes on. It goes on.
Work goes on.
What difference does it make
whether someone is ill or..
Make the call. Talk to them.
Finalize the contract..
Yes, sir?
Nurse, please send Rosina.
- Yes.
What's the need to show
efficiency at the wrong place?
Why did you write that Ankur ate
something an hour before surgery?
But sir, I informed you..
- I know.
That's why I am telling you.
Now we will have to
increase the time span.
But why, sir? What happened?
I forgot to use Ryle's tube.
- Oh, my God, sir!
Sir, the kid Ankur..
- Is in coma.
And...sir, hospital rules.
To hell with the hospital rules.
Whose hospital is this?
- Mr. Shekhawat and yours, sir.
And whose job is it to uphold
the reputation of the hospital?
Yours, sir.
- That's what I am doing.
Let it be. Keep this money.
Return to your village or city
or wherever you have come from.
If there is an inquiry,
I will handle it.
Is this nine fine? Natural?
Yes, sir.
- Sure? Okay. Okay. Okay.
Nurse. Nurse, patient number
23 Ankur Arora..
..room number 104.
Which nurse was on duty?
Wait a minute, sir.
I will just check. - Yes. Please.
Please be quick.
Here. I have it, sir.
- Yes.
Nurse Rosina.
- Okay. Where is she right now?
Sir, I don't know. If her duty is over,
she will be at home.
Duty is over?
Her duty is till 9:00 p.m.
How can she just..
- I have no idea, sir.
But she has left for the day.
Where does Rosina live?
Upstairs. Room number 28. First floor.
Hey!
Riya.
What happened in the OT today?
Riya, what happened to Ankur?
I told you. His lungs collapsed.
I am not asking what lies
you are telling the world.
I am asking what actually happened.
The answer won't
change by asking repeatedly.
His lungs collapsed.
- Is it?
If his lungs collapsed,
why wasn't bronchoscopy advised?
Why was he
straightaway put on antibiotics?
No chest x-ray, no ABG analysis.
Straightaway magnamycin.
Please, Romesh. Not I, but Dr. Asthana
decides the line of treatment.
You guys are treating him
for aspiration pneumonia.
Because he vomited after
the operation. Yes or no?
No. It was a lung collapse.
Riya, look into my eyes.
Tell me the truth.
Just tell me what happened?
Romesh, please.
This isn't your problem.
This is my problem.
This is my problem.
I promised the kid that
nothing will happen to him.
And right now, he is in coma.
You are saying it isn't my problem.
Romesh, stop..
- Riya, just tell me.
After the operation,
did he vomit in the OT?
Romesh, stop it.
I told you what happened.
No, Riya. You are lying.
Who are you trying to save?
I am not lying.
I am not saving anyone.
Riya, we have become
doctors to save peoples' lives.
Not to run the hospital for business.
Our job is to end people's suffering.
And not be a cause of their suffering.
Today, a mother is questioning God.
Why is He doing this to her?
She doesn't know that
it's not God's fault.
It's the fault of those
people who are trying to be God.
Riya, please for
God's sake open the door.
And tell me the truth.
Please. I beg you.

Well played, doc.
Sir.
What are you doing here?
Sir, I want to talk to you.
About what?
- Sir, about Ankur Arora.
What about Ankur...Arora?
Sir, everyone makes a mistake.
If we hide that mistake and if
that mistake costs someone's life..
..it's considered murder..
- What mistake? What mistake?
Sir, you know I am talking
about Ankur. He died because of..
..Pneumothorax.
Didn't you see the death certificate?
He died because of lung failure.
Do you know what you are doing?
You are insulting a reputed doctor.
Romesh, if I take
this insult seriously..
..I will throw you
out of the hospital.
And you won't be
able to do internship..
..in any hospital in the world.
And I am saying it sincerely.
So don't mess with me.
Sir, you can stop me
from becoming a doctor.
But just once tell
his mother the truth.
He died not because of illness
but because of your negligence.
Sir, please.
Sir, accept this truth in
front of his mother. Sir, please.
Goodnight, sir.
Sir, she has the
right to know the truth.
Sir, I consider you my mentor.
Sir, I worship you.
Sir, please don't lie.
Why do you feel ashamed
to accept your mistake?
In this profession of saving lives..
..you don't always
succeed in saving lives.
This is the truth.
Just accept it. It's better for you.
Romesh, it happens in
the medical profession.
It will keep happening.
Sir, if this has been happening..
- Enough. Enough.
We won't discuss this again.
Do you understand?
No, sir. I can't understand.
You won't agree like this.
I don't have time for this nonsense.
Come on.
Thanks.
What I was saying is..
Romesh.
Hello.
- Hello, son. Sit.
Do you know? Papa
was repeatedly asking..
..about you and not about me.
I have ordered soup for you.
No. I was just telling Riya
that this is the last year..
..of your internship.
And very soon you guys
will have to decide..
..what you have to do in this field.
That's it. I was concerned about that.
I have told papa
I want to do cardiology.
But papa is saying
I should do neurology.
Riya, mark my words.
Neurology is the future of medicine.
And robotic technology has
also become very advanced.
Your soup, sir.
- Because of that income is also good.
Romesh, have soup.
Romesh. Romesh.
What is this, Riya?
What the hell is the matter with you?
Do you realize you insulted papa?
He was saying
something to you, and you..
And Asthana is playing
badminton somewhere.
We are planning our future.
And there, a mother is
mourning her son's death.
She still doesn't know
the reason for his death.
Yes. She is mourning. Her son is dead.
And I am really sorry for that.
I am sorry we are not
doing what we should be doing.
So you tell me. What should we do?
We should stop living?
We should also mourn?
Truth.
You know what truth means?
We just have to tell that
mother the truth. Nothing else.
That you guys killed her son.
All of you have murdered Ankur Arora.
This is not the truth.
Today, seeing you, I am wondering..
..are you the same Riya I love?
Or are you the one
whom I don't even know?
What do you mean?
- You have become like them. Like them.
Like them? I have become like them?
Yes, you have.
Like the ones who build
their palace on someone's tomb.
Romesh, please don't say that.
I know I lied to you.
But what could I do?
I did not have any other choice.
You didn't have a
choice yesterday, Riya.
Today, you have a choice.
You will rectify the
wrong that has been done.
You will have to take
this decision today.
Right now.
Are you out of your mind?
Do you think I will go
against Shekhawat, Dr. Asthana..
..and the entire medical fraternity?
That too for the child who is dead.
Yes. That's what I think.
So also understand that
if we do this, we will be ruined.
Our dreams, our future,
our career. Everything.
So let us be ruined.
Romesh, please try to understand.
Papa has paid 80
lakhs as capitation fees.
So that I can be a successful doctor.
I can't just throw it away because..
..your conscience is pricking you.
Try to understand. Such accidents
are common in this profession.
So fine.
Today decide whether you
are with me or against me.
Decide? Against who? Against myself?
Is that what you want?
Romesh, I was also in the OT.
I am a witness to that incident.
I am a part of that incident
because I have hidden the truth.
If this matter is disclosed,
there could be..
..legal action against me.
I might have to go to court
and I might be sent to prison.
Please try to understand.
You can't see that unknowingly..
..you are going against me.
You are fighting me.
- Maybe.
And maybe everyone's
wellbeing lies in this.
I am not responsible
for that accident.
I won't let my life be ruined.
I have never seen truth ruining lives.
So tell me, Riya.
With me...or against me.
Romesh.
- With me or against me?
Romesh, please.
- Riya, with me or against me?
Romesh, you are
making a grave mistake.
Riya, answer me.
With me or against me?
Fine. So listen.
I am against you. Against you.
Are you strolling in a park?
Are you crazy?
When Arjun asked Lord Krishna,
""What is Brahma?""
He answers his questions.
God even talks about karma,
yoga and divine devotion.
It's written in Shrimad
Bhagavad that the supreme truth..
..is also known as Brahma,
Supreme Being or God.
Even a living being is called Brahma.
Arjun asks about the soul.
Why are you standing outside? Come in.
I am sorry.
I shouldn't have come here now.
But, I had to give you this letter.
So, I thought..
What's in it?
Please read it when you get the time.
See you. Thank you.
""Dear Nandita. I know
Ankur will never return.
""But, as his mother you've a right..""
""..to know what happened with him.
""Because, what you know is
far away from the truth.""
""What the hospital
told you isn't true?""
""And, you've a right
to know the truth.""
He was lying on this table.
After the operation was over.
'Oh my, God. He's vomiting.'
'Oh God!'
- 'He's aspirating.'
'Oh, God! Nurse. Intussception machine,
quickly. - He's..'
'Sir, his oxygen
saturation is dropping.'
'Call doctor Asthana, right now.
- Yes, sir.'
You don't know what to do
in a situation like this.
Except for the fact
that something went wrong.
'I cannot see anything.'
'Laryngoscope, fast.'
'What's happening?'
- 'He aspirated, doctor.'
'Why didn't anyone tell me..'
'..he ate something before
the operation?' - 'Ventilator.'
'No, doctor.'
'There's lot of vomit,
let me clean this first.'
'Nurse, quick.
- Sir.'
'Oxygen saturation's down.
- I cannot see anything.'
'There's food all over.'
'You are not doing this
for the first time, doctor.'
'You've done this a thousand times.
Streetscape.'
'Ventilator.
- Saturation's .5 sir.'
'The trachea's normal, sir.
- Are you sure?'
'Yes, sir.'
'Reading, Dr. Riya.
- It's going up, sir.'
'Please check, please.
- What?'
'Just check him.'
'Ankur. Ankur. Open your eyes.'
'Ankur. Open your eyes.'
'Ankur.'
'Ankur, can you hear me?'
The brain went dead.
Coma.
Oh, God. Baby.
My baby. My baby.
My baby.
I should've been here.
Oh, God.
Nandita, she's Kajori Sen.
Our advocate.
Mrs. Nandita Arora, we can definitely
file a case against them.
It may be tough.
But, we can demand a big
amount as compensation.
What price will they
pay for Ankur's life?
10 crores? 20 crores? 100?
That won't bring my son back.
So, what do you want?
Maybe, after this case..
..this won't happen with anyone else.
Shekhawat. The owner.
He's an influential man.
So, obviously,
he'll have powerful connections.
So, I hope you understand.
- I do, I do.
But, one doesn't stop
fighting with the fear of losing.
And Dr. Romesh. I hope..
..the doctors of your medical
fraternity will be against you.
They will never forgive you.
I will file this case.
We will defend it.
But, you can stand down if you like.
Save your career.
I can save my career..
..but what about my conscience?
Good morning, dear.
- Good morning, papa.
Sir, tea?
- Yes. Prepare the breakfast quickly.
I've to leave for office.
- Yes.
What are you eating, dear?
- Cornflakes.
Very good.
Hello.
Just a minute.
Sir, there's an urgent call for you.
- Fine. Go.
Hello.
- Sir, I'm speaking from Zee News.
Mrs. Arora, has filed a case of
Medical Negligence against you.
Would you like to comment on it?
Damn!
..there is an intern's hand in this..?
Excuse me.
Dr. Riya Srivastav. Sit down.
Tea? Coffee?
I'm sorry. I am Rajiv Mallani.
Mr. Mallani will be
defending our case.
In the Ankur Arora case..
..there were four other doctors
present along with Dr. Asthana.
You were one of them.
After that incident in
the operation theatre..
..did you talk to anyone outside?
Dr. Riya, anything that
you know and we don't?
If there's anything, then say it now.
Otherwise,
Dr. Asthana's reputation, mine..
..in fact, this
hospital will be a big joke.
And, we'll have to pay a big price.
So, in case there's anything?
Priya. Everyone knows about
your relation with Romesh.
You two stay together
in the Living Quarters.
People objected, but I said its love.
Let it blossom.
Speak up, Dr. Riya.
Was it Dr. Romesh?
Riya.
What did you tell Dr. Romesh?
Say it.
Speak up!
I'm taking my stuff.
And...keep this.
I don't need it now.
I told them.
I couldn't lie.
They wanted to know how
others learnt about that incident.
I said it was you.
You went to the lawyer.
So, why are you feeling bad about it?
I'm doing what I should.
You do what you should.
- Romesh.
I am helpless, not bad.
No, you're not,
I'm more helpless than you.
But, I've already made a decision.
That I will support the truth,
not run from it.
Truth? What truth?
A truth that's ruining our future.
Truth doesn't ruin anyone, Riya.
But evading the truth can ruin you.
Come in.
My resignation.
You're a fine example of
bravery and foolishness, Dr. Romesh.
Maybe.
It's better than being
arrogant and careless.
Dr. Asthana.
It's easier to point
fingers at others, Dr. Romesh.
Don't forget what happened in
the operation theatre that day.
Your hands froze while
administering an injection.
Careless?
If it wasn't for me..
..then Lakshmi would've died.
- I remember, sir.
You saved his life.
And, I also remember..
..you didn't allow me in the
operation theatre after that.
That's right.
That should happen with you.
You're right.
I made a mistake and I was kicked out.
Now, it's your turn.
So, you want me to
sacrifice my position..
..the hospital's reputation for you.
You don't need to do anything.
Now, I'll do
whatever needs to be done.
You won't be able to do anything.
I will finish you.
My career hasn't started,
so what will you finish.
I've nothing to lose.
And, you have everything.
My Lord, this year
on the 9th of June..
..a terrible incident occurred.
An eight year old boy
undergoing appendix operation died.
Because the hospital
his mother chose..
..trusted, wasn't fit to
undertake a simple operation.
And if they were capable,
they were careless.
Whatever the reason.
But, the innocent boy
had to pay with his life.
Your Honour, that day
before the operation..
..Dr. Asthana was
informed that Ankur..
..ate some biscuits an hour ago.
In such cases, doctors use a
special tube called Ryle's tube.
To siphon the food out of the stomach.
But, Your Honour. This tube wasn't
used during the operation.
Why? Because they forgot.
The biscuits in Ankur's
stomach became poisonous.
And spread to his lungs.
He went into coma.
Cerebral hypoxic.
And two days later, he died.
Your Honour, the
prosecution will now prove..
..that the hospital wasn't
just careless, but also criminal.
We'll prove that the
doctor's actions..
..was nothing less
than 1st degree murder.
We'll also prove that in
order to hide their crime..
..they aren't just guilty,
but also culprits.
I didn't make any chart, Your Honour.
Nor am I going to
comment on this profession.
Because I completely trust..
..the doctors of
Shekhawat General Hospital.
That, day during the operation..
..Ankur Arora's lungs collapsed.
In medical terms, it's
called Neumo-thorax.
In this condition,
the patient can't breathe.
The vital organs don't get oxygen.
The oxygen doesn't reach the brain.
And, the patient slips into coma.
And, that is exactly what happened..
..to Ankur Arora that day.
Abusing the doctors,
defaming the hospitals..
..blackmailing them is easy.
Because they care
about their reputation.
They become easy targets.
In fact, Your Honour, this is
a case of extortion, blackmail.
And, why should we bow before
such blatant blackmail, extortion?
You took my advice of
defending medical legal cases.
You've made a good name for
yourself by winning four cases.
Romesh had to come to you.
If you're smart,
we can delay this a lot.
Shekhawat has very deep pockets.
Time to make my new office,
and your new bungalow.
So...what do I have to do now?
Just keep humiliating
the hospital in the court.
And go easy on Dr. Asthana.
Keep saving him as long as you can.
The case will stay pending.
And the judge won't be
able to pass a verdict.
And I will make sure that
the confusion continues.
I have to go now.
Bye, my dear opposition lawyer.
You're always leaving.
Always in a hurry.
- I'm a busy man.
We were supposed to
talk about us today?
What? That I am married
and we don't have a future.
I know.
But I forget.
Mr. Bhargav. What do you do?
I am a handwriting expert.
So tell me, was your
expertise put to use..
..in cases like these before?
- Yes, many times.
I don't remember how many times.
Oh, I see.
Your Honour.
This is the blow up of a ledger..
..where Ankur's details were lodged.
The details before his operation.
It's written here
""Time before last meal, nine hours"".
Meaning nine hours.
Mr. Bhargav. Please tell the court..
..what do you find out
after reading this page?
For a common man,
this is just a number.
Number nine. But for me,
it's number one.
Which has been turned to nine.
Here, by turning it like this.
And, it's been done by
two people, not one person.
With two different pens,
at two different times.
Whenever we write
something on the paper..
..fine impressions
appear on the paper.
And we can see them
only through a computer.
Normally, when a man writes..
..impressions appear on the paper.
But, when he changes something..
..he does it with a light hand.
Carefully.
So, there are less
impressions on that side.
Even on this paper,
there are impressions everywhere.
Except, for this nine,
where it's less..
..which was changed.
What can I tell the court now?
It's all clear.
Two different people can't
write on the same paper..
..at the same place,
and the same time.
So, it's obvious.
Someone's changed that to nine.
Your Honour.
We don't know who stole this ledger.
We don't know whether
Dr. Asthana is behind it or not.
But, someone has definitely done it.
And, the funny thing is.
According to this ledger,
if Ankur ate something..
..nine hours before the operation..
..then, it was 1 o'clock at night.
And, I don't have to be
a genius to understand..
..that no patient eats
at 1 o'clock at night.
You're talking on the phone again.
That means you won't come today.
Not just at night, but we'll meet
less during the day as well.
As long as this case is going on.
If anyone sees us together,
we'll be in trouble.
You're right.
But, I wanted to tell you something.
It's urgent.
- What?
Not over the phone, we've to meet.
Now. Please.
What happened?
I am pregnant.
I thought something's
wrong with the case.
Don't worry, the case is fine.
Is this why you wanted to meet?
We could've talked
about this on the phone.
Yes, we could.
It's a small procedure.
Abort it.
There's a special on me
on the 10 o'clock news.
They will praise me.
I'm going to watch that.
Call me when it's done.
Kajori's trying to prove..
..that it's the
hospital's carelessness.
Not Dr. Asthana.
She's trying to confuse the issue.
""Anyone can steal the ledger,
anyone can write on it.""
""This...that.""
Smart move.
The court can't punish just anyone.
As our lawyer, it's her duty
to prove Dr. Asthana guilty.
But, she isn't doing that.
That's why I followed her.
I saw her with Mallani. Shocking.
She's trying to confuse us.
And, we're caught.
Can't she understand a child is dead?
She's taking
advantage of that, for money?
I want to meet her.
I want to meet her right now. Come on.
Kajori, open the door.
We know you're inside.
We want to talk to you.
Kajori, open the damn door!
We know you're inside!
Break down the door.
Break down the door.
Just break the damn door.
Just break it!
- Yes.
Oh, God.
Ajay, call an ambulance. Quickly.
The doctors are saying she's fine.
She swallowed...
She had an allergic reaction.
She barely managed to survive.
What?
- Abortion pills.
She was pregnant.
How are you feeling?
I am...
I am sorry.
Forgive me.
I promise..
He.. he was wronged
Can you forgive me?
Now you will know what it
means to lose your child.
You can fight this
better than anyone else.
Three days later
Dr. Romesh Sharma came home..
..and told me how my son Ankur died.
Your witness, please.
Do you recognize this form?
It's the same form you signed
before your son's operation.
Are these your signatures?
Do you sign any
paper without reading it?
Without knowing what's written in it?
What?
- No, I don't.
Then, please read out point two
in these operation guidelines.
Patient should be NBM,
6-8 hours before operation.
NBM. Meaning, Nothing
By Mouth, Your Honour.
It's clearly written on this form..
..patient cannot eat anything
6-8 hours before the operation.
He has to stay on a empty stomach.
And, the patient's mother's
signatures are on this form.
A mother that's blaming
the doctors for carelessness.
But, she's forgetting..
..she made the
biggest careless mistake.
She let her son eat biscuits
one hour before the operation.
Ask her, Your Honour.
What was she doing when
her son was eating biscuits?
Staring at him?
Watching television?
Or fixing an appointment
with the beauty salon?
Your witness.
Mrs. Arora, what is
Myocardial Infraction?
Do you know that?
- No.
It's a heart attack. Acute coryza.
You must be familiar
with these terms. - No.
No?
Common cold. Cephalalgia.
You must have heard this.
- I don't know all that.
Headache.
Don't you
know...according to my friend here..
..you should've known
all medical information..
..before admitting
your son in that hospital.
Objection, Your Honour.
The prosecution is
trying to lead the witness.
Excuse me.
Do you know what ED stands for?
I thought you know.
Erectile dysfunction.
Sorry.
- Your Honour, please answer me.
Did you know the meaning of NBM?
Objection overruled.
Your Honour, whether
the common people..
..know about these medical
terms or not, doesn't matter.
What matters is that the
treating doctors should know.
And especially a fantastic
surgeon like Dr. Asthana.
What the hell are you doing?
What do you mean?
- I mean you've to stretch this case.
You don't need to win it.
- I see.
Is that what I had to do?
- Sorry, I forgot.
What?
- Yes, I forgot.
Because, I am in a hurry.
I've to watch
television at 10 tonight.
Hear my praises on the news.
Only mine.
No one else.
Your anger is for the
rascal you had to abort.
No. It's for the
rascal I had to sleep with.
You're a compromising woman.
And nothing else.
I made you a lawyer.
You will stand against me.
I am still a compromising woman.
The only difference is,
this time I'm standing for the truth.
Not the body.
I will blow you away in the court.
Go ahead.
But remember, Rajiv Mallani.
This time, you're facing
two mothers, not two women.
We'll eradicate you from existence.
Just like women like us say.
We won't touch, and disrobe you.

They've hidden her here in Goa.
She's here.

There she is.
One with the priest.
You will be alright.
Christ is with you my child.
Yes, Father.
- Go.
Hi. My name's Kajori Sen.
I am a lawyer.
You must know,
we've filed a case against..
..Dr. Asthana and the hospital
in the Ankur Arora case.
Rubina. Listen to me please.
I don't know anything.
And, please leave me alone.
Rubina.
Listen to me.
There was a boy, Ankur.
You saw him with your own eyes.
You looked after him.
He told you that he ate something.
And, you went to Dr. Asthana, worried.
Do you remember that
boy's face, Rubina?
Tell me, do you
remember that boy's face?
He's no more, Rosina.
He's dead.
His mother performed his last rites.
He's turned to dust.
Your Honour. Prosecution
would now like to call..
..Nurse Rosina to the witness box.
Who? I am sorry, Your Honour.
Rosina's name isn't
on the witness list.
She cannot take the stand.
Moreover, the defense needs time
to prepare his cross-examination.
My Lord, she's a reluctant witness..
..and very important to the case.
The witness can take the stand.
The defense will be granted
time to prepare their case.
But, the witness will have to
be called again for the defense.
Do you agree, Ms. Sen?
- I agree, My Lord.
Tell the court your
name and your designation.
My name is Rosina D'costa.
I am a ward nurse in
Shekhawat General Hospital.
But, you just returned
from Goa. Is that right?
Yes. I had taken a
leave for a few days.
Rosina. Is it true
that you took leave..
..on the day Ankur slipped into coma?
Yes.
And, is it true that Dr. Asthana..
..paid you a huge sum, that day?
- Yes.
That's true.
But, there's another truth.
Dr. Asthana was sending you away..
..because you were
the first one to inform him..
..that Ankur ate some
biscuits before the operation.
Isn't that right?
Its okay, Rosina.
No need to be scared.
You can tell the truth here.
Did you tell Dr. Asthana about this?
Rosina. Look at me.
Don't be scared. Tell the truth.
Say it.
- No.
Nothing like that happened.
What? What are you saying, Rosina?
I didn't know whether the
child ate something or not.
And, I don't know what you're saying.
I don't know.
Rosina, why are you lying?
Rosina.
Silence!
Silence in the court!
Your Honour,
the witness has turned hostile..
..and she be excused.
The court will reconvene at
Monday morning, at 9 o'clock.
Rosina, why..
- Come on, sit down.
I didn't lay a finger.
And you're defamed.
What now?
Nothing.
We don't have
evidence against Asthana.
As of now, we've lost this case.
'Do people die in an
appendix operation?'
'No, no one dies because of it.
And we won't let you die.'
'Are you sure?
- Very sure.'
Yes, stop here. Stop. Stop.
Here's your fare.
Romesh.
- Come with me.
Where?
What happened?
- Just a second.
What happened?
What's wrong?
- I don't know myself.
This here. You see this.
This is vomit.
This thread was around Ankur's neck..
..during the operation.
His vomit is on the thread.
It's dried up, but it's adequate.
- For what?
DNA finger printing.
This vomit contains
Ankur's DNA. His vomited acids.
And traces of what he ate.
But how will we prove that..
..the vomit particles on
this thread is Ankur's,
The DNA of any child
is made of two sets.
Half the set belongs to the father..
..and the other half to the mother.
If we compare Ankur's DNA with yours..
..it will be a 50% exact match.
And that will prove..
..that the vomit particles on
this thread belongs to Ankur.
And if they prove in court that..
..Ankur vomited before the operation.
And those particles
stuck to this thread, then?
If he had vomited
before the operation..
..then his medical reports
would have anti-emetics..
..which is a
medicine to stop vomiting.
Which is not there.
He never vomited before the operation.
And after the
operation he was in coma.
He could've only have
vomited during the operation.
Romesh. You're a bloody genius.
Your Honour. With your permission..
..the prosecution requests
for four days of recess.
Only four days.
And why do you want this time?
I want to prepare
some more for this case.
The court grants
prosecution four days time.
But, this time's being granted
for the benefit of this case.
Not to push the hearing further.
- I assure you, My Lord.
That won't happen.
The court is adjourned for four days.
This is not a good sign.
She is up to something.
Kajori didn't demand
time for no reason.
She's definitely found something.
What do you mean?
What did they find?
- I don't have a clue.
But, I don't want to look like
a fool in the court. - Then?
How will we find out?
Rajiv, you don't want to
be embarrassed in the court.
I don't want to be
embarrassed in front of everyone.
Me and my company's
become the butt of jokes..
..due to this case.
I don't want any more damage.
Find out what it is.
- I understand, sir.
This game's going to
get a little dirty.
I suggest you two stay away from it.
Now, I'll do
whatever needs to be done.
I've Kajori's number.
Nandita's number must be
in the hospital records.
And Romesh..
Does Romesh still has
the same number, Riya?
Has it changed?
- No, sir. It hasn't.
Go to the ward.
- Okay, sir.
Yes, Mallani.
- I've Romesh's cell phone records.
What's this Technomate Lab?
He's been calling this place
many times in the last two days.
Technomate.
It's a lab where DNA
fingerprinting is done.
And there are few
such labs in our city.
Any idea why he was
calling this place.
What's the point of DNA
fingerprinting in this..
Unless, he's found the vomit samples.
Maybe? - And what if this
maybe turns to definitely?
Then, Mallani, we're..
This is a perfect match. Right.
Check it.
And, let's all leave.
It's time to close the lab.
- Yeah, sure.
Just give me a second.
- Yeah. - Thank you.
Oh, God!
A car's been
following us, from the lab.
Hurry up, hurry up.
- Step on it.
Who's it?
Oh, my God.
- Careful, careful.
Careful..
Oh God, it's a blind lane.
Oh, no!
Get out! Get out. Quick. Fast.
Run.
Just run.
That way. There.
I don't know what happened?
- No idea.
Everything was fine when I switched off
he computer last night.
This morning, there was
no data, no DNA samples.
So, you don't have
another copy of that report.
And we can't get that
test done again? - No, man.
I am really sorry. All the samples
have been contaminated.
But you must have some security.
Some CCTV or something.
You know, that's the thing.
All the footages from the
CCTV camera has been erased.
I've know clue who was here.
All I know is, as of now
we've lost everything.
Okay.
But this is criminal.
We can report this to the police.
We can't prove a thing,
how will we prove this?
She's right.
But it's a crime to
tamper with evidence.
And they also attacked us last night.
Yes. The law's there.
But we've no proof..
..to show that we had evidence.
Meaning?
Is it all over?
There's one thing that can be done.
And only Romesh can do it.
Speaking to you can get me in trouble.
The hospital staff's here too.
- I know.
Just two minutes.
What is it?
- You must know.
We had evidence to put
you all away for very long.
But we don't have
that evidence anymore.
They've been snatched.
Romesh, I don't want to fight.
- I am not here to fight, Riya.
In fact, I'm here to make a request.
It's your turn to
testify in the court tomorrow.
Tell the truth, Riya.
You were in the
operation theatre that day.
You saw everything, heard everything.
You're the only witness to this crime.
My last hope.
Please, Riya, I beg of you.
Swear on The Gita.
You'll only speak the truth..
..and nothing but the truth.
Yes. I will speak the truth.
Dr. Riya, you don't need to be scared.
We're with you.
On the 9th of June this year,
were you present in the OT..
..when Ankur was being operated on.
Yes. I was there.
What happened to
the child after the operation?
Dr. Riya, what happened to the child?
Tell us.
After the operation..
Speak up, Dr. Riya.
Speak up.
After the operation,
Ankur's lungs collapsed.
Your Honour,
the defense would like to move..
..for a motion of dismissal.
This case is ruining the image
of Shekhawat General Hospital.
And is keeping a busy
and important surgeon..
..like Dr. Asthana away from his work.
This is nothing but a
waste of public money.
Since the prosecution
has no more witnesses..
..and they couldn't prove
that Master Ankur Arora..
..died due to the
negligence of doctors.
So, I agree with the
defense and dismiss this case.
The case of Arora versus
Shekhawat General Hospital..
..stands dismissed.
Thank you.
Riya. What is this?
You're leaving your
internship incomplete.
Yes, sir.
- What nonsense?
You did so much for us.
We can do much for you in return.
We can make you the top
surgeon of this hospital.
The favor that you did to us..
- Favor?
What favor, sir?
I lied. I betrayed my profession.
I cannot stay here.
This burden..
- What burden?
What crime did you commit?
What did you do wrong?
We sir, not me?
We just made one mistake, Riya.
Just one.
And it led to this chaos.
And, so what if we made a mistake?
Do only humans make mistakes?
Doesn't God make mistakes?
Still, we bow before Him.
I..
I am just fed up of this nonsense.
But, you're not God.
- I am God!
I pulled thousands of
souls back from death..
..the ones your God
was allowing to die.
I've the same power as He does.
If I should be
punished for my mistake..
..then why do we spare Him?
I just forgot to use a tube.
I forgot to get some
biscuits out of his stomach.
So, I am the culprit?
And Him?
He kills so many
children before they're born.
Or, makes them a cripple.
He's not accounted for that.
Why do you spare Him?
He's God!
When your God gives pain to people..
..infects them with sicknesses,
they come to me..
..and I cure their pain.
So, if he's God then
I am a bloody doctor!
I am as powerful as
your so-called God.
If he's no criminal even after
making thousands of mistakes..
..then for making one
mistake neither am I.
So, yes, I am God!
Get that clear! I am God!
Fine, sir.
If you consider
yourself God, you can do that.
But right now, I'm finding it
difficult to be a human being.
Thank you and goodbye.
Hello, doctor.
Aren't you the same
doctor that's on TV..
I am God!
I pulled thousands of
souls back from death..
..the ones your God
was allowing to die.
I've the same power as He does.
If I should be
punished for my mistake..
..then why do we spare Him?
I just forgot to use a tube.
I forgot to get some
biscuits out of his stomach.
So, I am the culprit?
And Him?
He kills so many
children before they're born.
When your God gives pain to people..
..infects them with sicknesses,
they come to me..
..and I cure their pain.
So, if he's God then
I am a bloody doctor!
Doctor?
- Not now, later.
Just two minutes.
- Please go.
I am as powerful as
your so called God.
Hello.
- Dr. Asthana speaking.
Give the phone to your sir.
- Yes, sir.
Sir. Dr. Asthana.
Sir's in the bathroom.
- No need to say anything.
Tell him I've understood everything.
Coward!
Get out of the way.
Dr. Asthana, we've a
warrant against you.
Dr. Riya will please stand.
Dr. Riya has broken her
oath taken in the court.
Lied to the court.
That was just a way
to expose the truth.
The court respects her intentions.
Since she swore in the court of law..
..the court fines her Rs.20,000.
Shekhawat Hospital is
guilty of negligence..
..beyond reasonable doubt.
And the court, on this day..
..12th December, 2012..
..orders Shekhawat Hospital..
..to pay a compensation of Rs.10
crores to Ankur Arora's mother..
..within the next 15 days.
And, the court finds Dr.
Asthana guilty..
..for Ankur Arora's death.
And sentences him to
three years of imprisonment..
..under section 304.
The court is dismissed.

A nude humanoid alien lands on Earth on a research mission in Rajasthan, India, and is stranded when the remote control to summon his spaceship is stolen. In Belgium, an Indian woman, Jagat ""Jaggu"" Janani Sahni, meets a Pakistani man, Sarfaraz Yousuf, and falls in love with him. Her father objects to their relationship, citing their different religions, and consults their family astrologer, godman Tapasvi Maharaj, who predicts Sarfaraz will betray Jaggu. Determined to prove them wrong, Jaggu asks Sarfaraz to marry her, only to be heartbroken after receiving an unsigned letter calling off their wedding and not to contact him.

Jaggu returns to India and becomes a journalist. She is intrigued after finding the alien distributing pamphlets about a ""missing"" God. She earns his trust by rescuing him when he attempts to take money from a temple's donation box as a ""refund"" for God's broken promises, and he opens up to her. He stole clothes and money from a couple having sex in a car and befriended a bandmaster, Bhairon Singh. He learned Bhojpuri at a brothel by holding hands and exchanging memories with a prostitute and started looking for the thief who stole his remote in Delhi, where he earned the name ""PK"" (drunk) as people thought he was intoxicated when getting confused with different religions. When told only God can help him, he began practising many Indian religions, including Hinduism, Sikhism, Christianity and Islam, attempting to find ""God"" to no avail. He found out Tapasvi had his remote but refused to return it, claiming it was a gift from God. Believing his story after a brief hesitation, Jaggu promises to help PK.

After Jaggu pranks an unknown caller in front of him, PK naively conjectures Tapasvi and his other godmen must be unintentionally dialing a ""wrong number"" to communicate with God, advising the public against engaging in meaningless rituals for their prayers. Intrigued, Jaggu encourages the public to expose fraudulent godmen by sending their videos to her news channel. Gradually, this ""wrong number"" campaign turns into a popular mass movement, much to the dismay of Tapasvi. Meanwhile, Bhairon finds the thief in Rajasthan and informs PK that he sold the remote to Tapasvi. PK realises Tapasvi was a fraud all along, intentionally misleading people. Bhairon and the thief are later killed in a terrorist attack.

Tapasvi confronts PK on air, asking him what the ""right number"" is. PK claims people should believe in the ""real"" God that created them instead of other fraudulent godmen and their ""duplicate"" God. Tapasvi claims he has a direct connection to ""God"", citing his prediction of Sarfaraz's betrayal to prove Muslims to be liars. Having absorbed Jaggu's memories earlier, PK claims he can disprove his prediction and reveals Sarfaraz had not written the letter to Jaggu, citing the presence of another bride as a possible recipient that day. Shocked, Jaggu contacts the Pakistani Embassy in Belgium, where Sarfaraz worked part-time, and learns Sarfaraz has been awaiting her call for a long time, proving he still loves her. It is revealed that Sarfaraz had found the same letter that day and, believing it to be from Jaggu, stopped contacting her. Jaggu and Sarfaraz tearfully reconnect while Jaggu's father realises Tapasvi's true colours, and forces him to return the remote to PK.

PK is able to return to his planet with his remote. When leaving, he takes two suitcases full of audio tapes, having filled them with recordings of Jaggu's voice. PK tells Jaggu that the recordings are of sounds from earth. However, Jaggu finds out that the tapes are actually of their conversations. She also finds the love note PK wrote for her earlier, realising his love for her, but reluctance to confess due to her feelings for Sarfaraz. She chooses not to confront PK directly and tearfully watches him walk towards his spaceship. After his departure, Jaggu publishes a book about PK, grateful for her experience with him. A year later, PK returns to Earth on a new research mission on human nature with more members of his species.",4094,NA,NA,NA

Varun Batra is the CEO of a Volkswagen showroom in Mumbai and his wife, Deepti ""Deepu"" Batra, is a celebrity journalist. The two are a happily married couple going on seven years, but struggle to conceive a baby. Varun's sister Richa suggests the couple meet reputed fertility specialist Dr. Anand Joshi, who suggests they do in vitro fertilisation (IVF), a fertility technique that will enhance their chances. They agree, Varun submits sperm samples, and Dr. Joshi seemingly places the couple's embryo created in his lab in Deepti's uterus.

12 days later, Varun and Deepti are hastily summoned by Dr. Anand's wife, Dr. Sandhya Joshi, where the two run into another couple: Honey Batra and Monika ""Moni"" Batra, who have elected IVF as well. Anand guiltily reveals that a sperm mix-up has occurred due to the two couples homonymous surname: Varun's sperm have been fertilised Monika's eggs, and Honey's sperm with Deepti's eggs. Shocked beyond belief, both couples attack the two doctors. The doctors suggest that the couples go for a minor procedure so there is no chance of pregnancy. Varun later learns from Honey that Monika is pregnant with Varun's child, and Deepti is pregnant with Honey's child, but his rudeness causes Honey to fear the loss of his own child. He vows to prevent an abortion on Deepti's part, and he and Monika rent out a flat just above Varun's and Deepti's, much to the couple's shock.

Varun and Deepti initially project frustration against Honey and Monika during the first six months of pregnancy for interfering in their lives. However, during a routine check-up in the seventh month of pregnancy, Sandhya advises Deepti to try talking to Monika, who is probably going through as much as she is, being emotionally distressed. Realising that she needs to try to understand the situation, Deepti asks Monika out for a street food treat, during which they start getting to know each other. Deepti learns that Monika had suffered two miscarriages, making her sympathise, and the women bond. However, Varun still nurses a negative attitude, especially since Deepti is not carrying his child. She takes a stand in Honey's and Monika's favour for the first time, angrily telling Varun that he never cared to understand anything that happened post the mishap.

Varun, with Deepti's confrontation still fresh in his mind, makes an attempt to bond with Honey when they meet at a bar, and they almost strike a chord with each other, until Honey expresses concern over Deepti's work commitments, which he thinks will have a negative impact on the child. Varun, incensed, snubs Honey in a possessive manner, an argument between the two escalates until Varun storms out and Honey is arrested after the manager drops a call.

That night, amidst heavy rains, Monika knocks on Deepti's door in desperation: she has gone into premature labour and Honey is nowhere to be found. Varun hurriedly drives Monika to the hospital and she gives birth to Varun's child. However, the newborn is shifted to a critical unit in grave condition, having been born with a respiratory defect, accelerated by Monika's history of miscarriages, with little chance of survival. As it dawns on him that the baby is in fact his, Varun begins crying and hugs Honey when he arrives after being let off with a warning. Even as Honey and Monika reunite, he goes home and breaks down in Deepti's arms, apologising for his past insensitivity.

For a few weeks, both couples pray for the baby's recovery and Monika remains in the hospital as Deepti tends to her. The baby finally recovers and after 2 months, Deepti too has a successful delivery. Varun, now a changed man, invites Honey and Monika to meet the baby. Both couples finally bond and accept each other, holding each other's babies in their arms.",3796,NA,NA,NA

The film is set in Mumbai. It depicts the relationship between a husband and wife, the ever-growing human detachment from nature and people's attitude towards the physiology of a child's growth which is portrayed in a lighthearted yet satirical fashion. Rajib works for a multinational company and is far apart in terms of his nature from his wife, Ananya, who is a receptionist at a private firm. On the other hand, Kuhi, their three-year-old daughter, and Pakhi, the domestic help of the house, share a relationship based on innocence and pure emotions. Pakhi takes good care of Kuhi when Rajib and Ananya are away at work during the day. The whole family plans a vacation to their hometown Golaghat in Assam. There, Kuhi gets to know Nalia Kai, the helper of the house, who introduces her to a new world – a world of trees, birds, greenery, paddy fields and the environment at large. There she realizes the difference between the concrete world of Mumbai and the natural environment of her father's hometown. She also fears that one day the people of Mumbai would not have air to breathe, as she learns that we get oxygen from trees. This compels her to question the scarcity of trees in Mumbai.",1204,NA,NA,NA

"63","tt3447364","Detective Byomkesh Bakshy!",2015,"Plot

In November 1942, shortly after the Japanese take over Burma, a group of Chinese men from the Green Gang are unloading opium in Calcutta. They are suddenly ambushed and their leader gets brutally blinded by a mysterious figure. Three months later, the leader decides to return to Calcutta to investigate their missing opium.

Meanwhile, Ajit Kumar Banerjee takes help from Byomkesh Bakshi to find his missing father Bhuvan Banerjee. Byomkesh initially rejects the request, but decides to investigate after his lover marries someone else. The following day, Byomkesh visits the lodging house Bhuvan resided in, headed by Dr. Anukul Guha, and takes a room to investigate. Byomkesh finds Bhuvan's paan box with Ashwini Babu, Bhuvan's roommate, and deduces that he was murdered. Byomkesh visits the closed chemical factory where Bhuvan used to work earlier and meets Anguri Devi, an actress and a wife of the factory's owner Gajanan Sikdaar. Byomkesh finds some letters with Anguri Devi and deduces that Bhuvan was blackmailing Sikdaar, who might have killed Bhuvan and hid his body in the factory.

Byomkesh and Dr. Guha return to the factory and find Bhuvan's body in a machine, causing Deputy Commissioner Wilkie to question Sikdaar. However, Byomkesh discovers the letters are falsely backdated and saves Sikdaar from being framed. Byomkesh follows him home, but is stopped by Anguri Devi, who attempts to seduce him. Byomkesh meets Sikdaar, who immediately has a fit and passes away, having been poisoned. Suspicion falls on Sukumar, who was seen making death threats to Sikdaar. Dr. Guha leaves Calcutta temporarily, but sends Byomkesh a stamp, confirming he had faked the letters and killed Bhuvan. Satyavati, Sukumar's sister, pleads with Byomkesh to help her brother, who she believes is innocent and in hiding. Byomkesh finds the cab Sukumar was last seen in, and the driver directs him to the office of Dr. Watanabe, a Japanese dentist. Byomkesh and Ajit meet Watanabe, saying that they are volunteers for Sukumar's Basant Panchami agitation, but Watanabe suspects them and sends a real volunteer to follow them. Having observed this, Byomkesh and Ajit disguise themselves before following the volunteer back to Watanabe's office. Discovering the ruse, Watanabe kills the volunteer and his receptionist before escaping. The two enter his office and see their corpses, where Byomkesh finds a drawing in the volunteer's pocket.

Returning to the lodge, Byomkesh and Ajit meet Dr. Guha, who admits that he and Sukumar are working with the Japanese to free the country, with Sukumar to lead a Free Bengal, and killed Bhuvan and Sikdaar for betraying them. Returning to their room, Ajit vents about his father, revealing Bhuvan had lost his job at Hind Chemicals when they learned his master formula contained opium and addicted customers. Realising Ashwini is addicted to Bhuvan's custom paan blend, Byomkesh takes a chew and euphorically creates a mural of his understanding of the entire case, revealing Sikdaar said the words Young Gun to him before dying. The next morning, Byomkesh tests the mixture and his own blood; while his blood contains heroin, the paan is clean, making him deduce that Bhuvan had created an ""untraceable"" formula. Byomkesh learns from Kanai Dao, a fellow lodge resident and licensed opium dealer, that the opium supply in the local areas has been halted, and asks him if he can help Byomkesh meet any heroin suppliers. However, Kanai turns out to be a police informer and turns Byomkesh and Ajit to Wilkie, who tells Byomkesh about Yang Guang, a former Green Gang leader who wanted Calcutta's opium business for himself, and was killed in retaliation, but reportedly survived; Byomkesh realises Sikdaar was referring to him about Yang Guang.

Byomkesh discovers the drawing actually depicts the course of the Ganges through Calcutta and Sukumar's campaign points. With Kanai's help, Byomkesh meets with the Green Gang, where they realise Yang had set a deal with the Japanese to use opium smuggling routes to invade Calcutta by surprise on Basant Panchami, in turn giving Yang control over the city's drug trade. Byomkesh realizes that Anguri Devi is Yang's lover, whom she has not met in 4 years, and she had killed Sikdaar and attempted to seduce Byomkesh on his orders while being unaware of Yang's deal with the Japanese. With the attack scheduled for the next day, Byomkesh meets Wilkie and requests him to set off all air raid sirens at 4 AM, but Wilkie refuses, and Kanai defects to Byomkesh for saving him from the Green Gang. Byomkesh requests Dr. Guha, Satyavati, Sukumar and Dr. Watanabe to meet him at the lodge, pretending to have joined them and claiming they have been betrayed. At the lodge, Byomkesh reveals Dr. Guha is Yang Guang, conned the idealistic Sukumar into his deal, and plans to make Calcutta as the drug capital of the world. Byomkesh states that he informed the authorities about the landing points, but Yang claims that he is bluffing. Anguri Devi attempts to dissuade Yang, nearly shooting him, but he shows affection to draw her in before stabbing her. The air raid sirens are set off; using this, Byomkesh convinces Watanabe to leave and stop the attack to save his men. The Green Gang, having secretly observed the proceedings with Kanai's help, attack Yang.

Byomkesh informs a panicking Satyavati that he was indeed bluffing before being struck unconscious in the chaos. Byomkesh regains consciousness, where he is told by Ajit that the Green Gang has taken Yang. Byomkesh asks Satyavati to marry him, to which she smiles in reply. The Green Gang's leader orders his son to blind Yang in revenge at an abandoned factory, but Yang purposely blinds himself with the poker to turn the tables and kill the gang, where he plans the same for Byomkesh. As the factory siren rings, Byomkesh realises something is amiss.",5887,NA,NA,NA

We did even/thing together.
But, you got this done alone.
I wouldn't have got it done.
But, you cou|d've told me.
Aren't we friends. Tell me.
I felt offended.
Don't just stand there...
Tear up that poster!
You...
What's the point of
tearing off the poster?
You shouldn't have
done it in the first place.
Take it off.
Take it off.
Mummy.
Who cou|d've published this?
Chaudhan/ sir,
I am sure it's this teacher's doing.
What?
But, you shouldn't
have dragged me in this.
I dragged you in this?
- Yes...
Me?
- Yes, of course.
I didn't publish anyone's picture...
...and, I didn't get
a vasectomy done either.
Soorajmukhi wants a son.
Why would I get such a thing done?
This is your doing?
My doing?
Have you lost your mind, teacher?
You have children...
Even Chaudhan/ sir has children.
I am still a bachelor.
Why would I go for a vasectomy?
My marriage got cancelled
because of this.
My wife wants to divorce me.
Why would I get it done?
This is your doing.
You didn't get a vasectomy done.
I didn't get a vasectomy done.
Then who's left?
What?
No...you can never get one done.
Teacher,
I am sure you've a hand in this.
I will settle your installment.
You'll settle my installment, huh?
- Yeah...
Mine?
- Yeah...
How will you do it?
I didn't take a bank
loan or a credit card...
...then, how will you
settle my installment?
How?
I mean I won't spare you.
Just a minute...
Teacher,
I won't spare you.
Hey you...
My sister's engagement got cancelled
and you guys are fighting?
What are you two doing on the ground?
<i>'</i> Teacher...’
Teacher I won't spare you.
Forgive me...
Forgive me, teacher!
Chaudhan/ sir, If you stop
us from fighting like this...
...then, we'll soon leave this world.
Brother, we would've settled
this amongst ourselves.
Exactly.
Look...
We three are in trouble
because of this poster.
Right?
And we...
Where is he going?
What happened?
Ministn/ of Health and Welfare.
District Health Centre, Dhansar.
This is where we can
find out who made this mess.
Why you...
Speak UP
You're making posters
of our brother...
...and distributing it all
over the village. You fool...
Speak up... say sorn].
Wait...
You just ruined our brother's
life which was already hell.
Wasn't he insulted enough,
that you're insulting him more?
Wait...
Are you guys insulting him or me?
Even/one is insulting you...
...but, we're insulting
this bloody low life idiot.
How dare you publish these posters?
Leave him. Leave him.
Let him go.
- Chaudhan/ sir...you just tell me where.
I'll leave him personally.
I said leave him!
Leave him.
Leave him.
Chaudhan/ sirjust saved you.
Sit...
Breathe. Breathe.
Glasses... fix your glasses.
Sir calm down sir.
Sanjana.
- Yes, sir.
Get some cold tea for them.
Tea cold...
I mean... tea and cold drinks.
And sir, for you?
- Sugar...
Get sugar for me.
Okay, I will get it.
One black coffee, please.
Get that too.
Actua||y...|'ve low sugar.
But there are many
problems in this office.
Yeah...
My job is only stamping papers.
Are you telling or asking?
You were saying...
...your pictures were published
on the poster without your consent.
Huh!
Can I see the poster?
Show him the poster.
I'll show you the poster.
Here you go...
Open your eyes.
This is absolutely wrong.
- Absolutely...
By the way, you two are looking good.
But, why did you take him?
You...
You can see that we two
are looking good, and we took him.
But, why can't you see that...
...our pictures are published
on this poster for a vasectomy?
Yeah...
- You're right.
Someone's definitely made a mistake.
- Mistake?
My sister's engagement got
canceled because ofthis mistake.
We were humiliated all
over the village. - Yeah...
You must give a written apology
in even/ newspaper for this mistake.
Yes.
Look... once even/thing is cleared,
we'll apologize too.
He's willing to apologize.
And, you must remove our posters from
all the neighboring villages as well.
Yes.
Yes, we'll get rid ofthem.
And you must pay us
Rupees five lacs as compensation.
Five lacs?
Okay. . .we'|| pay.
Five lacs to him and him as well.
And rupees one lac each for us.
- Why you?
Arjun is like our brother.
The villagers doubt us too.
Fine...we will pay.
You see...this incident
occurred in Jangethi.
Jangethi comes under ourjurisdiction.
There's a health officer
called Balwant Chokan.
Remember that name.
So, meet up with Balwant
Chokan and he'll solve your problem.
And, if in case he can't
find a solution to your problem...
...and there are some hurdles,
then I am still here.
Yes...
Satisfied?
OK8V~
Fine...we'|| go meet Balwant.
But, if he doesn't
solve our problem...
...then, we'll pay you a visit again.
And then, I'll let these
three loose on you. - Yeah
Understand, Mongia!
And after that you won't need sugar.
Why? - Because I'll bun]
you in the sugarcane field.
Under Sugarcane field.
And yes, ifthis confusion
isn't cleared yet...
...then, I'll dip you in nitrate solution,
and mix you with potassium permanganate...
...and squeeze you in sulfur peroxide.
And I'll turn you into a solution...
Potassium permanut... Sulfer...
- What's he doing?
Just a minute...
What's he doing?
Yes.
Yes. Teacher. Teacher.
Are you threatening
him or dictating homework?
Brother, this is a chemical threat.
- Chemical.
I must be sure that
the formula is correct.
Chemical threat.
- Yes.
Let's go, teacher.
Talking nonsense.
Just say bye in English.
Chemical threat...
I will break your mouth.
Ohh, God. Control...
Sanjana...
Who says you lose
power after vasectomy?
Arjun.
Hail goddess.
Even after even/thing
that happened today...
...| called up Riya's father.
He said that you
got an operation done.
What operation?
- Leave it, mom.
But he was operated when he was a kid.
- In his childhood? When?
Remember when he
got huﬂ on his finger.
Don't you remember?
They put such a big
plaster on his finger.
It was hard to tell which
one was the little finger...
...and which one was the thumb.
That's when we got him operated.
But what has that operation
got to do with his wedding?
His finger was little back then.
But now...
Leave it.
You won't understand.
I will if you explain me.
- You won't.
At least give me a hint.
- Hint?
You won't understand.
His finger was small.
I wonder when the
power will be restored?
Stop cn/ing and tn/ to understand.
Understand what, son-in-law?
Understand what?
Who gave you this right?
Tell me.
What did she ask for?
Only a son.
But, you got rid ofthe only medium.
Does that mean you
will you'll go to couﬂ?
What will the people say?
Ohh...what are the
people going to say?
Didn't you think about them...
...when you killed
your future children?
Mom...
At school, he writes on
the blackboard with white chalk.
But look at my predicament...
He pushed my future in darkness.
And...he's out of chalk too now.
What have you given me?
- What are you saying, Soorajmukhi?
|...
Just a minute.
Yeah...
24-carat gold necklace...
7 Benarasi sarees...
1 diamond ring...
Silver anklets...
My home...
Two lovely daughters.
And... Where else have
I written the rest?
Enough!
You've written even/thing.
You've maintained an
account of even/thing neatly.
But...| don't think you
know that men run the world.
Tell me something...
Tell me...
I gave you two daughters.
Didn't I?
- Yes, you did.
So, ifl asked you for a son...
Then what is my mistake?
What age are you living in,
Soorajmukhi?
These days...there is no difference
between girls and boys.
Please explain her.
Isee...
So you're going to explain me...
...that there is no difference
between boys and girls.
No difference, huh?
They why did you marn/ a girl?
You shou|d've married a boy instead.
It's pointless to talk to you.
What is she made of?
Soorajmukhi...
Soorajmukhi...
P|ease...ca|m down.
I'm here to take you back home.
Let's go.
'| telled you... I no go...’
You call that home...
...where I there's a cold
brick instead of a husband.
Soorajmukhi...
That's no way to talk
in front of your parents.
Hear that...
Did you hear that?
Now I can't speak...
I can't open my mouth.
And you?
You just announced
to the entire world...
...and put up huge posters
even/where of your vasectomy.
What about that?
I know it...
You like your daughters...
...that's why you got
yourself sterilized.
I didn't get sterilized!
See, I was telling the truth...
...that's why power was restored.
- You see...
This power will come and go.
But you...
You just blew-up your transformer!
Come in, I'll tell you even/thing.
Is it true?
What?
What have you done?
You shou|d've thought about
what the people are going to say.
If he had thought about that,
sister-in-Iaw...
...then, he would've never
opted for a vasectomy!
You didn't even think
that we're Chaudhanj.
I haven't done anything
like you think.
Even if you got it done,
why tell the world about it?
You didn't care for
our family reputation...
...you cou|d've at least
thought about your sister.
Today was her engagement!
It's all over now.
Even/thing's finished.
Posing there like a model.
This poster is a fake.
This is a lie...
I didn't do anything.
These are official posters?
- So what?
Does the government
have an enmity with you?
Why will they publish your photo?
You're mistaken.
Even if it's true...
what is Anja|i's fault?
She's your sister.
That's her fault.
I told you a dozen times
to stop clicking pictures.
But no...
Now see what it has gotten us into.
Who would want to marn/
anyone from such a family?
Even/one's laughing at us.
Brother, Mr. Kulbhushan is right!
In fact,
I would've done the same thing.
listen...
Listen...
Listen up...
Choti...
Choti...ifthis is my fault,
then I'll fix even/thing.
Just watch,
you'll get married to Sunil.
I trust you, brother.
You've always been my Superman.
Superman can never do anything wrong.
Sir...
Sir, I've locked the gate.
That's not going to help.
I say lock all the doors and windows.
Sanjana madam just called.
She was saying that
they are dangerous people.
I've handled
even/thing...you don't worn].
Don't worn]...
With whose permission
did you publish these posters?
You...
You asked me to use
pictures of real men.
For an impact.
Forget the impact...
Tell me something...
...cou|dn't you use
pictures of other people?
What could I do?
The minister was visiting in 4 days...
Posters weren't ready.
So, I published whatever
pictures I could find.
Published them?
Now |isten...what's done is done.
- Done.
Put a hold on the next lot.
- Okay...
I can't.
- Why?
I dispatched that lot last night.
Silly boy...you'|| get me killed.
No.
You cou|d've paid some
guys from another village...
...and get their picture taken.
Did you pay me?
You've already gobbled the
money you got for the pictures.
I wonder where do
you adjust all of it.
Balwant...
Ba|want...come out...
Who is Balwant come out
Balwant...
Your name is Balwant.
- Balwant is dead.
Balwant...
Balwant...
They are calling you, Balwant.

Hold on. Hold on.
Which one of you is Balwant Chokan?
You bloody...
I am Balwant...
- You are Balwant...
Wait...stop...
I am Balwant,
but sometimes he's Balwant too.
He's lying.
- Just a minute.
Mr. Balwant, open this gate.
We want to talk to you.
Yes...
Look, we can't help you,
the office is closed today.
You...
He won't listen politely.
Break the lock.
Break it. Break it.
Break it. Break it.
Break it. Break it.
Don't you dare...
Hey""-
Who breaks locks with a shoe?
Use your head.
- You're absolutely right, Chaudhan/ sir.
Oh my head!
Move back, I'll break the lock.
Now watch my strength...
Look... Look...
Don't break anything...
...or else we'll call the police.
Balwant!
Don't threaten us.
We're being polite, you do the same.
So why reson to violence?
Absolutely right...we can be civilized...
- What civilized?
I'll settle your installments...
You come here.
Hold on...
Civilized, huh?
I'll talk to you in a civilized way.
Answer one simple question.
How dare you offend
our civic rights...
...and put up posters with
our pictures all over the city...
...promoting Sterilization.
What did we do on Friday?
Sterilization... meaning vasectomy.
Vasec. . iomy?
We don't get it.
Tomy...you speak,
at least we'll understand.
How dare you call him Tomy?
- You called me Tomy.
Wait a minute...
He's saying why you
published our picture...
...on the vasectomy posters?
Yes.
You're a government officer.
Does this suit you?
- No...
This is your fault.
So you'll give a written apology
in all the newspapers tomorrow.
We will.
And get rid of all the posters
you put up in the village. - Yeah...
Yes... ifthis is our fault,
we're ready to do it.
And as compensation...
- You must give Rupees 15 lacs.
Yeah...
- Rupees 15 lacs.
Yeah...
Rupees 15 lacs to him...and
Rupees 15 lacs to him too.
And rupees <i>2</i> lacs to us.
- In cash.
Listen...these are legal matters.
Legal matters always take time.
You know what, give us 3-4 years...
- Hey...
3-4 months...
- Hey...
Fine, 10-12 days.
Okay?
Give us 10-12 days.
I'll conduct an inquin/
on a personal level.
And, we'll call you
after we catch the culprit.
You must come here
on the date we call you.
And on that date, we'll decide...
Date after date after date...
Balwant Rai you swine...
- Swine...Swine...Swine...
He's talking to you.
Balwant sir...
We give you 12 days...
But, if you don't solve
this problem in 12 days...
...then, remember...
On the 13th day will be your funeral.
Understood.
Chaudhan/ sir is absolutely right.
12 days means 12 days.
Otherwise, on the 13th day,
you'll be in the graveyard...
...and we'll be behind bars.
Yeah...you have 12 days.
24 hours in a day.
60 minutes in an hour.
60 seconds in a minute.
So how many seconds in 12 days?
How many?
12 days...
8 into 40...
No, no, no, 60 into 40
Just a minute...
Teacher... you've made it clear,
didn't you?
Let him do the math.
You can do the calculation,
can't you?
Brother, it's a mathematical threat.
I must be sure.
Mathematical threat.
Teacher is crazy.
He got it.
He'll do it.
Let's go.
Don't forget,
we'll be back.
Go on...
One more thing...
The lock won't open.
We'll get it done in 12 days.
Really.
Chaudhan/ sir...
If only I had got my hands on him,
I would've torn him up.
If you like tearing things up,
then go out at night...
...and tear up all our
posters in the village.
Teacher, shall we tear you up...
or shred you to pieces...
Arjun...
Look at that stop-stop...
Stop the car.
What happened, Mr. Chaudhanj?
Arjun...Arjun...Arjun...stop.
Look at that.
What the...
What did Chaudhan/ sir remember
after seeing this picture?
Where did I get this picture taken?
What kind of a ringtone is that?
Hello. - This is Kunwar Singh,
the Iaundn/man.
I got rid ofthe stain on
your blue shin and stitched it up.
Stitched it up? Why?
I had to cut off
the stain with scissors.
It will cost you extra Rupees 20.
Hello! Hello!
He hung up.
I got rid of his stain,
and he hung up on me.
'| got rid ofthe stain on
your blue shin, and stitched it up.’
I had this picture taken...
at the fair.
There was a stain here.
So, I posed like this.
Murari, the teacher is right.
This picture taken at the fair.
I wore that jacket at the fair.
Riya baby gave it to me.
Yeah...
Oh yes...even I got this
picture taken at the fair.
So this means that photographer
made a mocken/ out of us.
Yeah...
Chaudhan/ sir,
I know this photographer.
Suraj photographer. Nainsukh Studio.
He charges a high fee
for a single picture. - I see...
How much? - You see, my friend
had a picture taken <i>2</i> months ago.
Since then he's asked
him for money 40-50 times.
What are you saying?
Bloody...
Do you know where we can find him?
Of course, I do.
Why did you print that poster?
He can't speak...
His connection is
severed with his voice.
You mean this mobi|e's on silent mode?
Yes sir.
His connection with
his voice is severed...
...but, he put up posters
of our sterilization even/where.
Yes.
No-no...he didn't print those posters.
Then who did?
We had our pictures taken by him.
Calm down and take a deep breath.
In and out.
Now...te|| us from the beginning.
I was born in 1970...
Mister, not that far back.
Stan from the fair.
- Yeah..
Sorn], I got carried away.
At the fair, I took his picture,

We'll ‘set’ that Subash straight
and turn him 'off' for good.
Let's go.
And bun] him in the centre...
Suraj, if you've lied to us...

Tell me...
- I've written even/thing...
Please hear it once.
- I did...| did...
Balwant sir, Suraj speaking.
Now listen to me carefully.
- Yes, Chaudhan/ sir.
When we go inside,

No one will raise his voice.
And no one will raise their hand.
But, Chaudhan/ sir...
Fine... okay...

Are you going to take another
35 years to finish this?
Please brother Subhaash,

You won't listen politely.
I am telling you for the last
time that I don't remember his name.
Your lives are getting ruined,
isn't it?
So stop wasting my time.
My time is ven/ valuable...

For evidence.
Doesn't that look nice?
Ven/ nice.
Come on, let's go see Balwant...
Murari carefully.
Stay away Murari, Careful.
Salutations.
Brother,
you always advise us to be calm.
But, you... - I say that to myself,
not you guys.
Be polite, be gentle.
Because, when I am furious,
I get out of control.
And then the guy never gets up...
...he goes up to heaven.
You're right.
You're right.
- I am right...
You're right.
Come on, let's take this evidence to Balwant.
- Let's go.
Papa's back...papa's back.
Papa...
- How did you two get here?
With mom.
- Mom?
Yeah...
Okay, go play.
- Careful.
Soorajmukhi, you're back.
I am so haPPV-
I thought you'll be
facing problems without me.
That's why I am back
home to look after you.
But, ifthere's anyone who
can look after you, then tell me now.
I'll go back.
- What are you saying, Soorajmukhi?
Who will take care of me except you.
Do you know my condition
when you leave?
Like a small plant in the scorching
desen, which cannot bear the heat.
Life has...
Life has...
Life has...
Just a minute.
- Forget it.
When you've a honest head, you
don't need a book to prove anything.
Understood, professor.
You know, Soorajmukhi,
I missed all of you so much...
...that, I haven't eaten
anything for the last two days.
Really?
- Teacher.
Here you go.
Aastha madam has sent dinner for you.
Sister-in-Iaw.
sister-in-Iaw, you're back.
That's great...
Now the teacher
won't need this food.
Ifthe other lunchbox is empty,
can I take it back?
Sister-in-Iaw,
are you planning on staying...
...or will you go back tomorrow.
Sister-in-Iaw, have you
tasted Aastha madam's cooking?
No one can cook better
than Aastha madam.
I can bet on it...
Bottle-gourd,
eggplant, carrots, radish...
She's the best cook
in the neighborhood.
And, the bottle-gourd
tastes really delicious.
See for yourself...
Ask the teacher yourself.
Isn't it, teacher.
Sister-in-Iaw, someone else
eats the teacher's lunch at school.
And, he eats Aastha madam's lunch.
Sister-in-Iaw, just taste Aastha
madam's cooking once.
There's has magic in her hands.
""Like a small plant
in the scorching deseﬂ...""
I will break your plant today!
Soorajmukhi...
Soorajmukhi, I am ven/ hungnj.
If only you could cook something for me...
- Why?
Go and eat from your lunchbox.
You returned that as well.
Isee...
Otherwise, you would've eaten that?
- No
I thought you will learn
your lesson when I am not here.
But no...
You're having a ball instead.
People are sending you food.
Great...
But, how will you face her now?
You're thinking about tying
the noose around your neck...
...after setting the rope on fire.
Arjun.
- What Arjun?
What happened?
Why call me so urgently?
Did your father find
another suitor for you?
Arjun...
Arjun, we...
We gave all the
evidence to Chokan sir.
And he's assured us that
soon even/thing will be fine.
I guess you don't trust me.
How do I explain you?
I didn't get any operation done.
That man... he'll tell the truth.
Look, just because I am back...
...that doesn't mean that
I believe you completely.
I haven't changed my
mind about divorcing you.
All you should know...
is that you have few more months.
Understood?
- Few months.
Meaning?
Is it true?
- Don't you believe me?
Arjun...
- Baby, I didn't mean that...
I mean...is it really true?
Fine.
Sorn]!
Teacher...
Yeah, teacher?
Right now?
That's Arjun.
Yes, Chaudhan/ sir.
- Arjun, what are you doing here?
Where's the teacher?
- He's the one who called me here.
Hasn't he arrived yet?
Chaudhan/ sir, one minute.
You won't believe it.
What?
It's a night-dress.
Don't you have one?
Even I am wearing a nightdress...
But, I didn't borrow
my kid's night-dress.
Forget that, Mr. Chaudhanj.
Listen to me...
I've found evidence of my innocence.
- I see...
Me too...
There's delay, but not denial.
Soorajmukhi is pregnant.
- Really, teacher.
Congratulations! Congratulations!
Congratulations! Congratulations!
Chaudhan/ sir, my baby's pregnant too.
What?
See that, brother...before the wedding.
- Yes, I can see...
Didn't you feel ashamed?
No.
You cou|d've at least waited until you
two got married. - I was going to...
Boys these days...
I wonder what's wrong with them?
Learn to respect women.
Looking at women like this
before marriage is a sin.
Look at me...
even after all these years...
...| never looked at any
woman except for Sunita.
In fact,
I didn't even think about anyone.
For me, there's Sunita...
...and for Sunita,
there's just me.
Wow...
- Did you hear?
He was referring to you.
- I see...
You sinner...
Actually, I thought...
Hello.
Phone.
Sheila is pregnant.
Sheila is pregnant.
Sheila is pregnant.
Chaudhan/ sir... huh...!
- Yeah, she's pregnant!
OK8V~
Take good care of Sheila.
Chaudhan/ sir,
I thought you were retired...
...but, you still
get the spunk in you.
Brother, I had only heard the song...
...but you actually
ruined Sheila's life.
Shut up, teacher.
What are you guys saying?
Sheila is the name of my buffalo.
<i>Oh, WW»-</i>
A buffalo.
That's really convenient,
Chaudhan/ sir.
Instead of arguing with sister-in-Iaw,
Buffalo seems better to argue with.
Your mind is so corrupted.
I just bought a new buffalo,
and her name is Sheila.
Ohh...
Teacher, how many months
is your wife pregnant? - One month.
Mine too.
- I see...
So this happened before
the posters were published? - Yes.
People will say that
you two fired your guns...
...before it got clogged.
Brother...
But Chaudhan/ sir,
even/one must know that we're men too.
We didn't get any operation done...
Are you going to ruin
some girl's reputation...
...just to prove that you're a man?
Aren't you ashamed?
Go home...
And that Chokan, he asked
us to come back after 10-12 days.
Let's wait until then,
and we'll see after that.
Okay.
Until then, good night you two.
Yes, brother.
Yes...we care.
Wow...the baby's showing
remarkable progress.
Do you see?
Papa...
Can you see the baby?
- Yes, I can.
Did baby see papa's poster?
Was that the baby's voice?
- That was me.
Naughty»-
Sorn], sorn]...
Well, we're done here.
Come out...
Teacher, come with me.
- Yes.
I'll wait outside.
Come, teacher. Come.
It's a good thing she got pregnant
with the baby before your operation.
Otherwise...
- Doctor...
Stop calling it a baby.
It can be a male too.
What are you saying?
Doesn't matter if
it's a boy or a girl.
They are all the same.
Please tell her.
Did you hear?
Did you hear?
Even the doctor's saying...
There's no difference
between a boy or girl.
Did you hear?
You'll know the difference
when I'll leave you if it's a girl!
The divorce papers are ready.
Doctor...
Doctor, please tell her
whether it's a boy or a girl.
If it's a girl, then I'll
be free ofthis burden right now.
No, teacher...| cannot do that.
Sex determination
ofthe fetus is a crime.
The doctor and the patient,
can both be jailed.
As a doctor I say...
...whether it's a boy or a girl
or whatever, you must accept it.
Because now he's put
a permanent full stop.
I don't care...
I want a boy...
You want a boy...
What's wrong with girls?
Look at the doctor.
Even she was a girl
before she became a doctor.
Was? - But it's the boy
who carries the lineage ahead.
I don't want a boy...
And the teacher has even
put up posters propagating it.
You see...| want a boy.
- I'll tn]!
And if it's not a boy, then
you'll no longer be a pan of my life.
Understood?
- I did.
Now let's go.
Teacher...
- What?
What, doctor? - You can
pay my fee outside, otherwise...
Yes, brother.
- Where are you professor, come over quickly.
I am coming.
Balwant...
- Balwant, come out.
You said 12 days,
it's been 15 days now.
Come out, you...
You took the evidence
but not a peep out of you.
You don't answer our calls
or meet us at your office.
You said you will help us.
Come out of your house Balwant.
Come out now like a prize
winning Iottenj, or else...
What are you doing?
Hey you...
Shall I break his window?
- Break it.
Balwant, come out.
Balwant, come out.
Brother,
should I break down the pot too?
Pot. Break it.
Break it.
Teacher...stop him.
- Yes, brother.
They don't know how
foolish they are acting.
Go stop them or I won't
be able to control myself.
Yes, brother.
Come out.
Break down his house. Break it down.
Hold on... hold on.
What is this?
It's a lock.
That means...
- It's locked.
Locked.
You fool...
Normally, when there's no one at home,
there's always a lock.
Teacher.
Let's go meet Balwanfs assistant.
You are right teacher.
Come on, Murari. Let’s go
to Ravi’s home and break his bones.
But this time, I'll go first.
- Papa, bathroom.
Quiet, Quiet, Quiet.
Are we waiting for
her to finish smoking?
Chaudhan/ sir...
Aunty...
Aunty...
Aunty... Aunty...
Aunty...!
Who is it?
Dharmender.
- No, his son.
Isee...
Let that be, aunty...and tell
us where are you hiding them?
Why Will I hide it?
I never hide it.
Here's the pack of cigarettes.
Aunty, can you tell
us where is your son Ravi?
Yeah...
Have you seen him?
- No, son.
I haven't seen him for four years,
since I lost my sight.
Have you seen Ravi?
How does my boy look?
He's a big idiot.
Ifl ever find that son of a gun...
...| will strangle him, that bloody...
I'll settle his installment.
You will kill my son?
You?
Before that,
I will riddle your body with bullets!
Hey""-
You bloody...
Hey Gun?
The old lady has lost her mind.
Hey.
Why did you stop?
Haven't you eaten?
Teacher - He's frozen.
- Teacher.
Run, teacher.
Come on, Princess...
It was working fine until now.
I wonder what's wrong with it.
- Come on... Come on...
It works...
Bhura, dump the bodies in the river.
And clean the blood stains
from the couﬂyard.
And get me a pack
of cigarettes as well.
Hello, alpha to gama.
- Sa Re Ga Ma.
Did aunt light up the scene?
- Yes...but they all sun/ived.
But, let's see how
long they can sun/ive.
Brother, why did you call me
to the farmhouse so urgently?
I spoke with Mongia.
He's given up.
And said we should
go to the Secretariat...
...and meet technical director Rekha.
Now, only she can help us out.
And Arjun called too.
He wanted to say something impoﬂant.
He'll be here any minute.
What does he want?
Let me warn you, brother...he's
dimwit who likes to invite trouble.
He'll definitely
get us in some trouble.
Who is this girl?
Chaudhan/ sir, this is Riya.
My love.
You know, her father isn't
giving us permission to get married.
So?
- So what?
I eloped with her.
Here? - Yes, we'll keep her at
your farmhouse for a couple of days.
Brother...| was right.
You numbskull...
Those posters have already
caused us lot of embarrassment.
Why do you want to spoil
our reputation as well?
Teacher...
- The teacher is right.
You've already made one mistake.
Why do you want to add to
our troubles by eloping with her?
Take her back home,
and we'll talk after that.
Brother...
If my father finds out,
then he'll kill me and my child.
And, if anything happens
to Riya and this child...
...then, I will raze the
entire village down to dust.
I didn't want to elope with Riya.
But, I didn't have an option.
I thought she can
stay at your farmhouse...
...unti| we can prove our innocence.
But it's okay, I understand.
You're in trouble too...
I'll make some other arrangements.
Come, Baby...
- Wait, Arjun.
Suhasini.
- Coming, brother.
Suhasini is our caretaker.
She will look after her.
Yes, brother.
She is Riya.
She will stay here for few days.
Go on.
Come.
Thank you, brother.
Arjun, we must go to
the Secretariat tomorrow.
To meet technical director Rekha.
- We will.
Mr. Trivedi,
we want to meet Rekha madam.
And you are?
I am Jagaavar Chaudhanj, he's
Arjun Singh...and he's Vinay Sharma.
Village Jangethi.
‘They are idiots!’
'Don't let them meet Rekha madam.’
'| hope you remember their names.’
Jagaavar Chaudhanj, Arjun Singh and...
...what was the third guy's name?’
'Vinay Sharma.'
Actually, Sir..Rekha madam is busy.
Please wait outside.
I'll call you as
soon as she's available.
P|ease...wait outside.
Meet Rekha madam.
Mr. Mehra,
your file's no madam's table...
...it's as good as done,
but I haven't received any text yet.
Mr. Trivedi.
- Yes.
Can we meet Madam now?
- Mr. Mehra, I'll call you later.
Madam has already
left for the day, sir.
She left.
- How can she leave?
Did she need your permission?
But, we had to meet her urgently.
Yes.
Come back tomorrow. - What if
she's not available tomorrow either.
Then come back the day
after or the day after that.
We've been waiting
for her over 4 hours.
Sometimes it takes 4
years...sometimes even 40 years...
...and yet they don't get to meet.
What are you saying?
What do you mean it takes 40 years?
Mister, this is the secretariat...
This is not your village square where
people have all the time in the world.
People are busy here.
Sir, I am just an ordinan/ employee.
She is the boss.
We'll have to follow her orders.
Sir...but in my current situation...
...whatever I say will
seem like a Iie to you.
What are you doing, mister?
What are you doing?
Throw him down.
Chaudhan/ sir.
Why didn't you tell us
that Rekha madam is leaving?
Yes, why not?
|...|...| was going to tell you.
Sir, have mercy.
I have a wife and two small kids.
Leave him.
Throw that idiot down.
Isee...
Hey...
- Police!
Let Trivedi go.
Chaudhan/ sir,
the police are here.
I say let him go.
- Don't leave me.
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.
Who said let him go?
Pull me up and let me go.
First, pull me up. Pull me up.
Pull him up.
What are you doing?
Pull him up, or else I will shoot.
Don't shoot.
Selfie.
- Look here.
Look here... Now pout.
I said pout.
- Pout?
Pout.
Pout.
Pout.
Don't shout... pout.
- Yes...
Pout.
Pout...
- Yes...
Yes...
Pull him up.
This is for evidence.
Now come up.
Come on. Come up.
So that's why you
hung him upside down.
But, what will you do
about their negative thinking?
Ifthey weren’t so negative...
...then, they wou|d’ve turned you into
heroes, instead of humiliating you.
We need to change their thinking,
Chaudhan/ sir.
And that’s why I suggest
that you go to the court.
Defend your case and win.
That's when you'll bring
about a change, understand?
Inspector's right.
Let's file a coun case?
We'll get justice in 50-60 years.
We're giving too
much imponance to this.
Let's wait and watch.
Soon even/one will forget
in a couple of months.
Will Soorajmukhi forget?
Will Riya's father forget?
Will my sister's in-laws forget?
This is an unnecessan/ effon,
brother.
It'll will only cause
us loads of sweat.
The coun has never
made things easy for anyone.
This is exactly why
we never progress...
We throw down our weapons
even before we can fight. - Yes.
It's a good thing that Chandershekhar
Azad and Bhagat Singh didn't think like that...
...who worked hard
to liberate our countnj.
And now, why can't we put
in a little effort for a court case?
You're absolutely right, brother.
One should do anything possible
to save their reputation.
Look, teacher.
You for Soorajmukhi,
Arjun for Riya and me for my sister...
...we must fight this battle.
- Yes.
We must prove our innocence.
Yes.
You're right, brother.
You're right.
We must drag this
deaf government to court
Yeah...
You've come to the right place.
People say that,
if you want to win a case...
...you don't need luck,
you need Jaanki Bhai Sonipatwala.
Jaanki Bhai...Sardar?
Gujarati is my mother's tongue.
Ohhh - You don't worn].
I'll give this government
a run for their money.
Ajay...
- Yes.
Remember my TV Reponer friend Aniket.
- Yes.
Call him up and tell
him we've got breaking news.
You mean we'll come on television.
You won't just come on television,
You'll be all over it.
We'll be on top ofthis case.
Unbelievable, teacher.
I swear...
Yes, Rekha madam.
Sir...
- Hmm...
Do you like roses?
Even/day-
We return once again with news
about to the Health Ministnj.
Just recently the Health
Ministn/ was in the headlines...
...for expired medicine scam...
...and now their names are being dragged in
another scandal.
— Sir, news about our department.
Come, we'll introduce you to these
Poster boys from Jangethi village...
...who are a living example
ofthe government's biggest mistake.
Mr. Jagaavar, what do have to say?
Well, we want to say that
we never went for any vasectomy camp.
Yeah...
They just printed our
pictures on the posters.
Without your permission.
- Exactly!
Why will we give permission for
anything like that? - Absolutely right.
I see...now, let's talk to Arjun.
See...
We know who is responsible for this.
Pretty soon they will
be running for their lives...
...and we'll beat them to a pulp.
- These people will never learn.
We're going to give them
a sound thrashing.
And now, we'll let you
know the teacher's opinion.
We went to the Secretariat.
And we...
- Look here.
And we weren't allowed to
meet Technical Director, Ms. Rekha.
What did you do? Tell us tell us.
You didn't tell me.
- Yes, sir...they did.
They made quite a scene.
Trivedi told me about them.
But...| couldn't meet them.
- Why?
Because that day we were at the hotel...
- Yeah, okay.
Absolutely right.
We want justice.
Justice!
Sir, the TV's switched off...
Can I staﬂ now?
- Wait...
First, go and handle
this Jangethi case.
And meet with that Mongia and...
What's the ba|dy's name?
- Balwant.
Balwant.
- Go meet with them.
Otherwise, we'll get in big trouble.
P|ease...go...
Sure?
- Yes, go.
Okay, sir. We’|| call them tomorrow.
How can she be in one mood all day?
What is this charade?
And with whose permission?
Not me, ma'am. It was them.
What was the urgency
to print the posters?
What could I do, madam?
Minister sir wanted to inaugurate
the Vasectomy Camp.
So...
And we needed posters.
- Yes.
And I asked him...
Ask him.
But, he raised his hand
like a Laughing Buddha statue...
And that's why...we got
the posters printed in a haste.
I see...got the posters printed?
What will I tell the minister now?
People are raising fingers
at the minister because of you.
And he's getting hot-headed on me.
Well, madam,
that's between you and the Minister.
What?
What did you say?
I was just joking.
Are you my brother-in-Iaw?
That you were joking with me.
Show me your repons!
Yes.
Repoﬂ...
- Here's the report
Ma'am, the coun
has also sent a notice.
What do I do now?
Do anything...
But if fingers are raised
at the Health Ministnj...
...then I'll make sure
your health deteriorates too.
Understood?
It's all over.
And, we're getting humiliated
all over the village.
Why don't you withdraw
your case against the government?
Brother,
you cannot harm the government.
But, our reputation
is getting damaged.
And now...| can't contest
for the village-council elections.
And Anja|i...better get
Sunil out of your mind.
Because he doesn't care
whether we live or die.
Fine, I'll withdraw my case.
Ifl withdraw the case, then
maybe you can contest the elections...
...but, will she get married?
No, she won't.
I will fight this case...
Iwillwin...
And then, Anjali will get married.
You don't have the same power anymore.
I'll settle your installments,
you buffoon...
You must come with
me to the police station.
There's a complaint filed
against you for kidnapping Riya.
Boss has already informed the police.
- Arjun, I am no longer your boss.
You've been fired.
- Fired?
Look Arjun, you must withdraw
your case against the government.
Look, small-time recoven/ is okay.
But it's not your cup of tea
to challenge the government.
Take him in.
Just a minute.
Vinay, you're being
transferred to a place...
...where you'll never see any student.
But, my advice to you is that...
...you should withdraw your case,
and even/thing will be fine.
What will you achieve by filing
the case against the government?
Family.
Family, sir.
I cannot lose my family.
And, don't forget I am a teacher.
Ifl don't stand
up against injustice...
...then, how will I teach
the children about right or wrong?
Thank you, sir.
Do you know...
the police has arrested Arjun.
I know.
Then you must know that
he eloped with some girl.
I know that too.
I wonder where is he
hiding that poor girl.
Some idiot must be helping him.
And these stupid people
who help these idiots.
You know, I want to
get hold ofthese hooligans...
...and beat them to a pulp publicly...
Hey!
What's wrong with you?
- Why are you abusing people?
I...
-Yes.
Phone...
Pickup my phone...
Yes.
Hello.
- Hello, is this Jagaavar's number?
Who are you?
- Please give him the phone.
Listen...
- Hmm...
What time is it?
- Is someone asking for the time?
It's 12 o'clock (midnight).
It's some female on the phone,
and she wants to talk to you.
Female?
Hello.
- Brother, it's Riya.
Hello.
Yes speak.
I've been throwing up since evening,
and Arjun's phone is unreachable.
I am really scared.
Please come over quickly.
Yes...|'m coming.
It's Suhasini.
- What's wrong with her?
She is throwing up.
No-no... not her, Sheila...
The Buffa|o...she's throwing up.
Do buffa|o's puke too?
- Yes.
Women puke, don't they?
And, the Buffalo's a female.
I see... - Please come soon, brother.
I am really scared.
She's scared... She's scared...
I am coming.
I am coming...coming...
Why didn't Suhasini speak to me?
Huh?
Good question.
I'll ask her.
Can I go now?
I must take a doctor...
for the buffalo.
OK8V~
listen...
I can't let you go alone at this hour.
I'll come along with you too.
- No-no-no...what will you do?
It's midnight. Stay here.
But, don't go alone.
Take Anuj with you. Anuj...
Yes, sister-in-Iaw.
- Go back to sleep.
I'll take the teacher with me.
- The teacher?
What can he do?
- He just got a sonography done of his buffalo.
Does the teacher have a Buffalo too?
- Yes, a big one.
I never saw it.
He keeps her inside...
She's berserk...
- I see...
S0 |...|...
I am getting late.
I'll call you.
Pick up...
Pick up...
Hello.
- Hello.
Teacher...remember the
buffalo who is pregnant.
She's ven/ restless since evening.
- So, what can I do, brother?
Listen to me and understand.
Understand...
So, you are coming with the doctor...
And, I am coming too.
Arjun is not coming. He's in lockup.
But you are coming for sure...
Understood?
You are coming.
Who is coming and who is going?
Are you understanding or not?
Are You?
Teacher are you or are you not?
- Yeah...Yeah...Ya'
I get it, brother.
I got it. Riyal Arjun's Riyal
I am coming!
I am coming with the doctor.
Okay... I am coming.
Strange... What's this
way of talking to the teacher?
The teacher is from Bhopal.
Bhopal.
That's how they talk.
I am leaving.
I am leaving.
The teacher is from Bhopal?
What is this?
Brother,
didn't I tell you the other day?
It's a night dress.
Not that, what is this?
- Ask the right question, brother?
It's a who, not what.
She's the doctor.
- I...
Why did you tie her up
with the veil?
I woke her up and told
her it's an emergency.
She said I'll come along,
but which vehicle do you have.
I said it's a scooter.
She said she falls
asleep on the scooter.
I thought what if she
falls down and dies, so...
...| tied her to myself.
Isee...
Doctor, wake up.
Doctor, wake up.
The deliven/‘s done.
Healthy and strong.
Oh! thank you so much.
Oh my, God. Hello...
- Hello.
I've seen you before.
- Seen me?
Yes..
- How's it possible?
It's true... I've seen him before.
Where have I seen him? - I just came
to live in this village <i>2</i> years ago.
Isee...
Before this, I was at the Kashmir border,
the Ladakh border, the Rajasthan border.
Not there...
Then where did I see you?
You must have seen
him in JP Dutta's ‘Border’.
Doctor, come along.
Come, madam. Please.
Let's go...|et's go...
- JP Dutta...
Doctor, the patient is throwing up,
let's go.
Who is the patient?
- It's her.
Who is she?
- She's the patient...
How is she related to you?
- She is...
She... she's his wife.
Wife?
- Wife!
Your wife? She?
No-no-no...
What else would I have said?
That's not her.
She's not the girl who
came to my sonography center.
She's someone else.
She has changed.
Who is she?
Doctor, I brought her for sonography.
her?
I've 25 years of experience.
I can guarantee she's not the
one who came to me for sonography.
She has changed.
she's someone else.
I can prove it to you.
She is not your wife.
Is anyone listening to me?
- Soorajmukhi!
I am sad!
Didn't I tell you that you've changed?
But you never agreed.
And see...even the doctor
has confirmed today...
You have changed.
You have become different.
Just like cotton turns
into a piece of cloth...
Soap turns to foam...
Similarly...
Just a minute...
Forget this...your marriage
will turn into divorce.
Divorce.
- Divorce. - Divorce.
You said it three times.
Divorce.
Yes...divorce.
Doctor, we called
you here to check her up...
...but you caused a breakup instead.
What are you saying?
- You're responsible for this.
I haven't done anything.
- You're responsible.
What is he saying?
- You're responsible!
Brother, I only said it once...
What are you doing, teacher?
Why are you divorcing
your wife in this condition?
Yes because she has changed.
Even you said it now.
No, no.. Misunderstanding.
I guess I was mistaken.
I was a|so...s|eepy.
- Isn't it?
Now that I look at her again...
yes...that's her.
She came for the sonography.
Yes, that's her.
Are you sure?
- Yes, sure.
And your 25-year-old record?
- It's broken.
Broken.
- Records are made for breaking.
And, I made this
record and I broke it.
So...
But, please don't
break your relationship.
I won't...| won't...
just check her up, please.
Tell me what you ate.
Nothing...2 bowls of grams,
<i>2</i> bowls of kidney beans...
...1 bowl of lentil, vegetables, corn
bread, cottage cheese with gravy...
...four pieces of bread, 1 bowl
of mutton and sweetmeaLwith cream.
Did you leave anything?
- Yeah, chutney.
It was ven/ spicy.
No need to worn],
she's got gas.
Gas... gas...just gas?
- Yeah, just gas.
Pay attention to your diet,
understand.
Okay.
Come, teacher.
Come on...
Oh god
- Teacher.
I am protecting her.
She sleeps like a
dead body on the scooter...
...and if she falls down,
she will turn into a real dead body.
He's right.
I fell down last month.
Who was driving?
- Me.
You mean...
- Shall we?
Yeah.. bye.
- Bye...
I had a word with the lawyer...
...Arjun will come home soon.
- Okay.
I've called Riya's father too.
Why?
We'll convince him...
...to let Riya and
Arjun get married. - I see.
You saw what happened
last night. - Hmm.
Just imagine...
She should be with her
mother in this condition.
Oh teacher...
Which doctor did
you take to see Sheila?
Sheila is absolutely fine now.
You don't believe me.
See for yourself.
Anuj, bring Sheila out!
You've crossed all limits, brother.
Hiding Arjun's sin in our farmhouse.
We already have such a
bad reputation in this village...
...that you're resoﬂing
to such things.
Chaudhan/ sir... Hello.
- Hello.
Mom.
- Riya.
My child
So you three kidnapped my daughter.
I am going to teach you three
a lesson, I'll drag you to couﬂ...
...or else my name isn't Dharamchand.
You should stop worn/ing
about your name...
...and, think of a name
for the one that's on the way.
On the way? Who's on the way?
Mister this is why we called you here.
You have to be strong...
Your daughter is pregnant.
- What?
With Arjun's child.
You...
- Dharamchand!
I admit that Arjun and
your daughter made a mistake.
But, this is your fault too.
You didn't give them
permission to get married.
That's why Arjun brought
her to my farmhouse.
And anyway, a real man never leaves...
...and not someone who desens
his love when in an ordeal.
Arjun cou|d've refused
to marn/ your daughter...
...after getting her pregnant.
He cou|d've run away.
But he didn't run.
He didn't run...
Look... Arjun loves
your daughter a lot.
Yes...
And you can see the
result ofthat love.
Teacher?
I admit he made a mistake...
But let me tell you...
...you will never find anyone
like Arjun no matter how hard you tn].
I am already tired of Arjun...
...why would I tn/ to
find someone else like him?
And, you and I know that
she's pregnant with Arjun's child.
But who's going to
convince the villagers?
They will say that Arjun
can never get anyone pregnant.
This is entirely my daughter's fault.
They will point fingers
at my daughter's character.
No-no-no...| cannot give
permission for this marriage.
Dharamchand, I'm a family man too.
I request you for Arjun's sake...
No brother.
Brother...
You don't have to plead
to anyone for my sake.
He's not willing to understand.
I love Riya, and that's not a crime.
What I think doesn't matter.
Your posters are
all over the village...
...that narrate your entire ston].
You filed a case against
the government, didn't you?
Now go...
Go to the court and prove
that you didn't get a vasectomy done.
After that, I'll let you marn/ Riya.
Otherwise,
you can forget Riya for good.
And, as for this unborn child...
If you fail to prove
yourself in the couﬂ...
...this child will never
get to see this world.
Why you...
Arjun.
Come on...
Arjun...
-Come on...
He's not Mahabharafs Arjun.
Your honor, this case filed
against the Health Ministnj...
...is fake and completely baseless.
These three willingly volunteered
for a vasectomy without stitches.
And now, in order to get more
compensation from the government...
...these people are making
false allegations, your honor.
Here are their NOC letters!
And their Vasectomy ceﬂificates!
And these photos, which they willingly
handed over to the health depanment!
He's lying...
Come here, I'll stick this
poster on your face with my hand.
He's lying...
Brother...
Brother...
Order! Order!
I am here...
I am here for you...
Please sit down.
The coun grants time to Jagaavar
Chaudhanj, Arjun Singh and Vinay Sharma...
...to gather evidence
for corroborating their ston].
The coun is adjourned
until next hearing.
All they get is date after date...
...and their troubles keep adding up.
Dear...
Neha?
What kind of behavior is this?
You see, since the poster incident...
...kids at school keep teasing her.
""O benevolent Lord...""
""...for the sake of our devotion...""
""Bless us...""
""...with Your grace.""
""These feet...sti|| have hope.""
""O Lord...you're our faith...""
With passing time...it seems
almost impossible to get justice.
Somewhere far away,
a ray of hope could be seen.
Sunil, how long will you
keep rejecting marriage proposals?
Mom, you knowl love Anjali.
Whenever I get married,
It will only be with Anjali.
And these three, had no clue about it.
If we had done nothing...
...this matter would've
eventually faded away.
But now, this blemish on our
reputation will never get cleared.
No one's going to listen to us...
No one...
Teacher, don't lose hope.
Someone will definitely hear us.
You're right, Mr. Jagaavar.
You shouldn't lose hope.
You will definitely get justice.
Maybe not on the coun, but you will
get justice in the people's court
And, I will help you.
I will take your ston/ to them,
so that...
...peop|e will find out the truth.
Look, we don't have money
to pay your commission.
Mr. Jagaavar, I've earned money...
Give me this one oppoﬂunity
to earn some respect.
Okay.
Tomorrow...Press conference.
So Mr. Chaudhanj,
how will you get justice?
We'll protest.
We'll go to Gandhi Maidan
(Open-ground) and go on a hunger-strike.
Chaudhan/ sir, people have
been going on hunger-strikes for ages.
What are you going to do different...
...which you think will
convince the government.
Hey man, get some biscuits for us.
We're not on a hunger strike.
Thousands of people like you
go on a hunger-strike even] year.
They burn effigies ofthe government.
But what do you think
will be the result?
Nothing.
This time it will...
I am cenain.
- Nothing is going to happen.
We'll expose the government
in front of even/one.
Because they stripped
us naked in front of even/one.
And...
The government exposed us pub|ica|y..
now we will expose them publicly.
...and now,
we'll strip the government.
That's what I was saying.
And so we'll stage this protest...
without wearing any clothes.
Huh...
What?
Will you really strip
off all your clothes.
You are right brother.
We'll strip off all our clothes and protest.
- Isn't that a great idea.
Sir biscuits - Go away,
can't you see this is breaking news.
And you're worried
about tea and biscuits.
Mr. Arjun...are you guys really
going to strip off your clothes...
...and go on a hunger strike?
When brother said nude,
he means nude.
Once I make a commitment...
'|n this age, along with
the truth...
This is breaking news.
...one also needs sensation.’
Come to Gandhi Maidan
and see for yourself.
This is front-page headlines.
‘That's the truth.’
...we'|| be totally nude...
Brother, please stop him.
What is he saying?
Teacher, better staﬂ
getting into shape. - Why?
You should look in
shape...when you strip down.
Mr. Jagaavar, what is Arjun saying...
- He's right.
Do you think this fight
will benefit you in any way?
Or, maybe you'll lose whatever
little reputation you have left.
One who fought on the
battlefield attained martyrdom.
But, the one who never
fought was already dead.
In this battle for respect,
we'll face embarrassment.
But, he who loses
respect for oneself...
Will have no self-esteem.
In this crowd of shameless people,
we've made up our mind...
...even if we've to strip
down to our last piece of cloth...
...but, we must save our reputation.
Chaudhan/ sir, fantastic...!
Amazing...
Take care...
Come, brother...
Brother is here.
Hello, sir.
Look at how we decorated the tempo.
""Let's go to Gandhi Maidan...""
""Don't lock horns with us,
cause this is the strip-off protest.""
What do you think
about the decoration?
Even/thing is fine, but...
I am looking really great.
Brother, do you know
who owns this vehicle.
Who?
Sunil!
Sunil!
Yes brother.
Did father give you permission
to come here? - Not yet...
But he will...
I have faith in you, brother.
Let's go... ‘Gandhi maidan'
""Time to see who's in dire straights.""
""We must fend against
an army of millennial...""
""...we...naked soldiers...""
Teacher...
Amazing, teacher.
You said that without forgetting.
Do we take off our shin first or pant?
- Even/one will be stripped naked.
Let's go.
So that was the ston/ until now.
Now, to find out whether
they will get justice today or not...
...keep watching Tea-vee news.
Madam, do you have a TV here.
- Yes...7 patients have TB...
...and the doctors are treating them.
Not TB, I meant television.
- Oh... yes, we do.
Then turn it on...
They're showing the
protest on the news.
Really?
Are they showing it on TV?
- Yes.
Madam, don't take so long.
Turn it on quickly.
- Yes.
Hello, ladies and gentlement...
My name is Kishan and...
I request the citizens
of this countn]...
...to suppoﬂ us in this
movement and encourage us.
And, if you feel we're
right then doesn't matter...
...in which pan
ofthe countn/ you are.
Just strip off your clothes,
and support us in this movement.
And, take a selfie of
yourself or make a video...
...and upload it to our
site on 'nangakardegadanga'!
Jai Hind!
Jai Hind!
Nice...
Even] Tom-Dick-Harn/ is heading
to Gandhi Maidan these days.
Now Arjun will say a few words
about the ‘Nude Movement’.
But there are hardly any people here.
Arjun, more will come.
You speak.
""Drums beating...""
""Drums beating...at even] step....""
""At even] step...""
""Drums beating...at even] step....""
""Drums beating...at even] step....""
Look at that, what's going on?
Will these guys really
strip off their clothes?
They will have to.
Do you think it's true?
- Seems like it.
Let's go.
And now...
- Look! More people are coming.
""Drums beating...""
- Yes, brother.
""Drums beating...""
Brother.
""Drums beating...at even] step....""
""At even] step...""
Sir, more people are joining
the crowd.
Wait for my next call.
Teacher, you were amazing.
Mister, we've heard
enough of your speeches.
But when are you going
to take your clothes off?
Because...peop|e want to know.
Why, brother?
- He's so restless.
And now, the creator ofthis moment,
Arjun Singh...
...wi|| take off his clothes
and staﬂ this protest.
Mom, give me your phone.
- Here.
""Arjun pick the phone"".
- Give me my phone.
Yes baby say.
Arjun, I am watching you.
- Where? How are you watching me?
I'll settle your installments.
On TV...where else?
Why are you feeling so embarrassed
to take off your clothes?
No...
You...
look really sexy without the clothes.
My Arjun Singh...
take your shin off...
and surprise even/one.
What are you saying, baby.
I love you.
- I love you too, baby.
Total nude.
Wow brother, what a pose.
Take off the jacket,
can't do it without taking it off.
Aniket...
- Yes?
Upload the videos.
Ok.
Brother...videos?
We made a couple of
people take off their shin...
...and made a video.
To suppoﬂ this protest.
We're going to upload
those on our social media.
But, brother...
Sometimes in order
to expose a big truth...
...there's nothing wrong
with telling small lies.
As soon as Arjun Singh
took off his clothes...
...peop|e from different pans ofthe
countn/ took their clothes off too...
...and uploaded their videos.
Shall we call Hari Singh now?
Hari.. you know right,
what you need to do?
Consider it done...
Yeah, I am on my way there.
So as you can see, this nude
protest is not just a protest...
...but, it's a slap
on the government's face.
What's going on?
- Sir, it's the nude movement.
What? Nude movement?
There's a nude movement at Gandhi
Maidan, I was just watching that.
The Poster Boys have
stripped off their clothes...
...and begun this revolution.
But the government is still quiet.
And now, to take this protest ahead...
...teacher Vinay Sharma of Jangethi
will take his clothes off next.
Teacher, take your clothes off...
Teacher, take your clothes off...
Don't be scared teacher,
take your clothes off.
I am.
I don't come to such
protests even] day.
He's a Sharma and
still not feeling shy...
...and you're a Dubey,
why are you feeling so embarrassed.
Sharmaji.
""Drums beating...""
Sharmaji.
""Drums beating...""
The teacher is a real hero.
One needs guts to
do something like this.
Isn't that true?
I agree with you.
Why don't you show some guts too?
Take off your shin.
Poster Boys...we're with you.
We only had 2-3 videos.
Are people really
sending these videos?
Yes...
You're getting the
suppoﬂ ofthe people.
Who is behind them?
I don't think anyone is behind them.
But people are joining them.
Call even/one from
the Health Depaﬂment...
...who are involved. Quickly.
Okay sir.
Along with the Minister.
Mr. Jagaavar, take your
clothes off...it's your turn now.
Jaagavar sir, take your clothes off.
We're with you.
Long live Chaudhan/ sir.
What are you doing?
Nothing...
It's really hot out here.
The government hasn't
taken any action on this case.
And now, Arjun Singh
is taking off his pant.
Don't lock horns,
this is the nude movement.
Riya.
Madam, she's in pain.
Please take a look.
- I see...
Someone call the doctor, quickly.
- But, you're the doctor.
Me...
- Huh
Oh yes.
- Please, take a look.
Did it have to happen now?
Good going, Chaudhan/ sir.
Now, teacher Vinay Sharma
will take off his pants.
Teacher, take it off.
What happened to him?
Soorajmukhi, is even/thing okay?
- Yes, teacher.
There's still time.
And listen, all the best.
- All the best to you too, Soorajmukhi.
Don't worn]...
This time it's going to be a boy.
It's not right to discriminate
between girl and boy.
Didn't you always tell me that?
I get it now...
- Really, Soorajmukhi?
Honestly.
And yes, I suppoﬂ you in your fight.
As well as our unborn child.
Whether it's a girl or a boy.
I love you, Soorajmukhi.
I love you.
Brother.

You're amazing...
Poster Boys... we are with you!

your clothes stripped off or turn, call me.
All the best go for it.
Poster Boys,
don't worn]... we are with you!
We love you Poster Boys!
Did they really get
a vasectomy done or...
No point in hiding it from me now.
I can help you only
if you tell me even/thing.
Sir, actually they
didn't get a vasectomy done.
Actually, it was their fault...
...that their pictures got published.
Sir, it's such a small mistake...
- Sir, please don't worn].
I'll take care of them.
Sir, I'll manage.
- Manage?
These people are standing
on our heads now...
...and how did you manage?
Sir, I...
- I worked really hard for this post...
...and now, I can't depend on you.
Manage?
I'll have to do something.
They have the public on their side.
Now, we must win these
people over to our side.
I'll show them what's the real power.
They have no clue about a CM's power.
Get the force ready.
He||o...Aniket...
Brother, you've managed
to gather a really big crowd.
Yes, brother, you were fantastic.
I only staﬂed a movement...
But you know, people know even/thing.
Jagaavar sir... Jagaavar sir.
CM sir is coming.
Isee...
You mean he's accepted?
No, he's coming with his entire force.
Will they shoot us?
No...
They can't do that in
front of such a huge crowd.
Maybe they will just arrest us.
- Yeah...
And later shoot us.
- Brother...
You mean our plan
will eventually fail...
brother...
Don't be scared.
Let him come...
We'll see...
Chief Minister Down-Down.

What did you guys think?
That you will tn/ to
go against the government...
...and the government will stay idle.
But, you were wrong.
Brother,
God knows what he's going to say.
These people are protesting
against the government...
...and you are all supponing them.
Why?
Because they are not wrong!
We believe them, they have been wrong.
Okay..okay.
Until now you only heard
the Poster Boys side ofthe ston].
But now,
I am going tell you the truth.
Truth?
Call him.
Yes sir.
Balwant...
Come up and tell them the truth.
Madam, don't worn].
Hello...
Hello...
I will tell you the truth.
The truth is that these three visited the
sterilization camp in Jangethi village.
Yes...
It's okay.
And these three willingly...
And another one.
I asked you to tell the truth...
...and the truth is that you
should be stripped off your clothes.
Not them.
You shou|d've been exposed, not them.
It's entirely your fault, not them.
Move!
Get out!
Get out!
The truth is that it is entirely
the Health Department's mistake.
Yeah...
And these three are innocent.
We won...we won.
As the Chief Minister of the state,
I apologize to them publicly.
Long Live Poster Boys!
Long Live Poster Boys!
But, there is one thing I would
like to bring to your attention.
Men's mentality!
Only women should
get a vasectomy done, not men.
Why?
Does that make him any less a man?
Who told you that?
Doctor?
What is manhood?
Toﬂuring women!
No, no.
Enduring the cruelty
you're subjugated to?
No! Never!
Real manhood is about...
...giving women equal rights as men.
Raising your voice
against the cruelty on you.
And I am proud that there are
three men like them in our state...
...who raised their voice
against the cruelty against them.
And shoot the government.
I apologize to them again.
- No, sir...no...
And also announce Rupees <i>2</i> Lacs
to each person as compensation.

no need for that now.
Father...

Koose Muniswamy Veerappan, during his teenage years starts working as an assistant to his relative Sevi Gounder, a notorious poacher and sandalwood smuggler. His father and relatives, whose village lay in the forest area, were also known to be poachers and smugglers. Veerappan (Sandeep Bharadwaj), dominant in Sathyamangalam Forest in the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, defies the governments, and Indian Border Security paramilitary forces, and maintains a small army. He is wanted for killing approximately 184 people, about half of whom were police officers, including senior police and forest officials. He was also wanted for poaching about 200 elephants and smuggling ivory worth US$2,600,000 and about 10,000 tonnes of sandalwood worth approximately US$22,000,000.

In 1991, Veerappan and his chief Intel Gandhi, beheaded IFS Officer P. Srinivas. Years later, Veerappan avenges the death of his close associate Gandhi by misleading Special Task Force (STF) personnel in their covert operation, through Gandhi's unnamed notorious informer. The covert mission led by T. Harikrishna S.P., and his informant S.I. Shakeel Ahmed to kill Veerappan fails miserably. Veerappan and his army brutally assassinate all the STF officers in the operation and snatch their arms.

The Tamil Nadu STF chief K. Vijay Kumar I.P.S. appoints his associate, an undercover I.P.S. spy in the Karnataka region, a master-strategist (Sachiin J Joshi), who puts in place Operation Cocoon through a network of tribals, and informers, such as a deputy spy, a woman STF spy and landlord (Lisa Ray), who befriends and rents out a house to Muthulakshmi-the wife of Veerappan (Usha Jadhav). On the other hand, a team of loyal undercover cops led by Rambo Krishna, leaves Palar base of STF, near M. M. Hills, 100 kilometres (62 mi) from Kollegal of Karnataka along with a team of 41 members which includes police from two states, forest officials, forest watchers and informers. The team travels in two vehicles, of which one is a bus carrying most of the team members, and a jeep carrying K. Gopalakrishnan, the IPS officer. Veerappan's gang plants landmines on the road in more than 14 places to halt their approach, and during the Palar blast, K. Gopalakrishnan, standing on the footboard of the jeep, is thrown out, and suffers severe injuries, leaving the police to retaliate and ultimately prevent the snatching of arms.

After a few failed attempts, including the one led by another undercover cop, disguised as a subordinate to Islamic underworld don - Kadaani, to negotiate an arms deal with Veerappan's gang, the STF team led by master-strategist, and an ex-spy turned timberyard owner-Kumar, finally succeeded on 18 October 2004. On that day, Veerappan is escorted out of the forest by Kumar, who earlier infiltrates Veerappan's gang in disguise to negotiate another arms deal with Velupillai Prabhakaran. Subsequently, Veerappan and his men board an ambulance stationed at Papparapatti village in Dharmapuri district. Veerappan and his men are first warned and then asked to surrender, which was denied, and the men start firing at the STF personnel. The STF retaliate by firing grenades and gunfire, subsequently, Veerappan and his men are killed on the spot.",3255,NA,NA,NA

The film opens in 2016 BCE with Sarman (Hrithik Roshan), a young man from the village of Amri, who lost his parents at a young age. Sarman kills a crocodile that has been terrorizing his village's fishermen and is hailed as a hero. He asks his uncle, Durjan (Nitish Bharadwaj), to allow him to go to Mohenjo Daro to trade their family's goods, but his uncle refuses. Sarman attempts to sneak away to the city at night with his friend Hojo (Umang Vyas) but is caught by Durjan, who relents and allows both friends to go. He gives Sarman a seal that contains an inscription of a unicorn that Sarman often sees in his dreams, suggesting he uses it only once in a life-or-death situation.

Arriving in Mohenjo Daro, Sarman learns that the city is ruled by the tyrannical Senate Chief Maham (Kabir Bedi) and his wicked son Moonja (Arunoday Singh). He also learns that the unicorn he sees in his dreams is the symbol of the city, and feels the city is oddly familiar to him. While Sarman is trading, Maham proposes to impose an additional tax on the farmers so that the city may grow, but Sarman leads the farmers to oppose the taxes so that their families don't starve to death. Sarman gains access to the upper city by showing his uncle's amulet and meets Chaani (Pooja Hegde), the daughter of the head priest (Manish Choudhary) of Mohenjo Daro. Sarman is enchanted by Chaani's beauty and charm and falls in love with her. Upon meeting, the head priest strangely appears to recognise Sarman. Chaani reveals to Sarman that she has been forcibly betrothed to Moonja. Maham discovers that Sarman and Chaani love each other and that Sarman is the leader of the tax revolt, so he challenges Sarman to fight Bakar and Zokar, his two champions. Sarman proposes that if he wins, Chaani will be released from her engagement, and Maham accepts the terms.

On the night before Sarman's clash with Bakar and Zokar, the head priest reveals to him how Maham was expelled from Harappa for illegal trade with the Sumerians. Maham entered Mohenjo Daro as a trader and quickly rose to become the trade chief. Maham had discovered that the mighty Sindhu River held vast gold deposits, so he decided to place a dam on the river and divert its course to mine the gold. The wise Senate Chief Srujan (Sharad Kelkar), who is revealed to be Sarman's father, opposed this, but Maham won the vote to build the dam. He had Srujan framed and arrested for hoarding gold. Chaani's father and Durjan – Sarman's uncle – were coerced by Maham to betray Srujan, and the former was killed later by Moonja – Maham's son. Maham then took Srujan's place as the new Senate Chief.

In the arena outside the city, Sarman faces the ferocious Tajik mountain cannibals Bakar and Zokhar. After a vicious battle, he kills one of the cannibals but spares the other, and the people of Mohenjo Daro surge even stronger behind him. Enraged, Maham urges Moonja to finish off Chaani and the priest. Moonja kills the priest, but Sarman saves Chaani and kills Moonja.

Sarman exposes Maham's plan to use the gold from the Sindhu to enrich himself and to smuggle in weapons from the Sumerians. All the chiefs now stand against Maham. The people elect Sarman as the new chief, but Sarman suggests Mohenjo Daro needs a people's government, not a chief. With the arrival of a heavy thunderstorm, Sarman realises that the dam will burst and the Sindhu river will flood the city. He rallies the people to lash boats together and form a floating bridge. They evacuate Mohenjo Daro and cross to the other side of the river. The dam collapses, and Maham, chained in the city square, drowns as the city is destroyed. The survivors migrate to another river, where Sarman sees the unicorn of his dreams and names the river Ganga.",3764,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt3859980.srt","(Ancient Sindhu language)

because...
these brave young men have saved
Amri village from that monstrous crocodile.
Many many thanks, Sarman!
Sarman...
may your strength grow hundred fold!
Bima!
Why does it always have to be you?
Is there no one else in the village?
Every time Amri has a problem,
why are you expected to solve it?
It's the truth!
When the river changes course...
Sarman must find a way
to direct water into our fields.
When to plough the fields,
when to sow the seeds...
when will it rain?
As if without Sarman's permission...
the sun and the moon
will not rise in Amri.
Now now, you should be proud,
but instead, you are scolding him.
Aunt Bima,
if I can help, then why should I not?
I was worried to death today
thinking about you and that beast.
Do not worry about me so much!
Aunt Bima, you often hum this tune.
This tune...
it does not belong to Amri, does it?
Aunt Bima, have you ever
seen a one-horned animal?
Deer like? With a long,
pointed horn on its forehead?
Why do you ask?
I saw it in my dream.
It was just that - a dream!
Now get ready...
your Uncle must be waiting
for you in the fields.
The indigo crop has not
been good this year, Sarman.
Far away, when the
Sindhu changes course...
then our River Nara also
moves away from our village.
How will the crops grow?
Uncle, may I ask you a question?
<i>Moherfyo Datum'?</i>
Everyone is leaving tomorrow.
This time let me go
with them for the bazaar.
You have asked the same question
for the past three monsoons now.
I am tired listening to it,
are you not tired of asking?
Until you say yes,
I will keep asking.
Uncle I want to travel
to the far off lands.
Which part does the sun rise from?
Which part does it set?
How far does the light fall?
I want to see all that Uncle.
A bird's offspring
should not leave its nest...
until it's ready to fly, Sarman.
Sarman... won't you eat?
What happened?
Once again he is insisting
on going to Mohenjo Daro!
He is upset because I said no.
His anger is like a dew drop,
it will evaporate in no time.
But...
how long can we stop him, Durjan?
As long as possible!
He was asking me
about the Unicorn earlier.
I just don't understand!
What is it about Mohenjo Daro
that makes Uncle so restless?
He is afraid that if you
go there, you will settle down.
Hojo, do you not feel like seeing it?
What?
What the land outside Amri is like.
What the people are like?
What the girls must be like?
You have not found
a single girl in Amri that you like.
What makes you think the girls
in Mohenjo Daro will be any different?
How would I know?
But my heart tells me that
the girl who will be my companion...
there will be no other
like her in all of Sindhu Land.
Then your meeting has
already failed to happen.
Every year, before the bazaar,
it is the same story.
Uncle does not
want you to go, Sarman.
Leave this obsession.
But I want to see Mohenjo Daro, Hojo!
So now what? You want to fly
to Mohenjo Daro like the birds do?
What happened?
Crocodile?!
The sun has yet to rise!
- Let's go!
- Let's go? Where?
Mohenjo Daro!
Mohenj0...? Without telling anyone?
What if your Uncle...
what if my Mom and Dad find out?
It's alright. Come on...
<i>Barter 'vs not easy 'm Moheflyo Dare.</i>
Pay close attention
to what I am about to say.
Tell me, Uncle.
Whatever happens,
do not drop the value of the goods.
Mohenjo Daro is very
different from Amri.
The city is full of greed,
not people.
Be careful always...
and do not trust
a stranger to be your friend.
Do not worry, Uncle!
Hojo will keep an eye on Sarman.
Phum.
Till today you have been
trading for me.
This time Sarman will go,
I can no longer stop him.
- Look after him.
- Right.
Here is some food.
Take care!
Keep this with you.
Open it only when it's
a matter of life and death! Promise me!
Hojo.
Mohenjo Daro!
And that is our Holy River,
Mother Sindhu!
The South Gate is
for foreign traders...
and their living quarters will be
along the walls of the South Gate.
The East Gate and the North Gate
are for the citizens of Mohenjo Daro.
How was this built?
What is that symbol, Uncle Phulji?
Six creatures' symbol! It represents
the six great cities of Sindhu Land.
Each creature acts
as a symbol of a city.
And which animal is that?
With one horn?
That's a Unicorn, Sarman.
The purest animal
in the Order of the Sindhu...
the symbol of Mohenjo Daro!
Bull cart riders, go inside
and get your token for trade.
Two indigo sacks from Amri as tax!
Where does our indigo tax go?
Take this!
I thank you.
You?!
Why have you come here?
- Listen...
- Go back!
Listen to me...
this... this city is full of greed...
this is a land of thieves!
Save yourself! Or you will burn...
- Go away!
- Jakhiro!
Step aside! Let the traders through.
Do not frighten them.
Move!
Go away!
Return!
Who is that?
His name is Jakhiro.
It pains me to shoo him away.
People call him a madman!
But it was the ancestors
of this very madman...
who laid the foundations
of this great city!
And once, he was
highly respected in the Senate!
Sarman! There are houses
on top of each other!
It feels as if I have seen
all this before. I do not understand.
But I do know this...
it is exactly
as I had imagined it would be.
Even I feel the same! As if I was
born to be here! Just look at them!
We have come here only for trade!
Do not forget!
But I'm doing just that...
I'm trading my heart!
Idiot!
Colorful beauties...
from the land of Dilmoon!
The skull of a Zebu bull!
Quickly, find a place for your stall
or you will be left standing.
Hurry up...
Stop!
Quickly, quickly!
If the bazaar has any sparkle this year
it's because of those foreign traders!
Foreign traders? Where?
That group with the tall hats...
they are from Dilmoon!
They trade the goods that they
acquire here, in faraway lands.
They are Makkans - their ships
are said to be so big that...
they can easily carry a
hundred travellers across the sea...
and it takes them some
twenty suns to reach Makkan.
Twenty suns?! Do their ships
not fall off at the edge of the sea?
Only those who have
travelled, would know.
And they are from Bukhara -
the faraway lands in the cold North.
But what is this strange
creature they bring with them?
Does it give milk?
No, not milk,
it runs fast, helps travel.
- What is it called?
- Hor-se!
Hor-se!
One hour has passed!
Use this indigo to color your clothes
or paint it on your walls... take it!
We will give you 8 sacks
of wheat for 3 sacks of indigo.
No, I cannot accept
less than 1O sacks of wheat!
No, not 10... 8 sacks!
Please, take a look at the quality.
Highest class of seeds, sown
and harvested at the right time...
watered by the pure Nara river and
grown with the love of Amri village.
These are the qualities of my indigo.
That is why I cannot accept
less than 1O sacks of wheat.
Listen!
Take whatever they are offering,
the market is slow this time.
They will barter elsewhere.
Sarman, don't forget what Uncle
had said... don't drop the value!
But there is an abundance of traders,
then why is the market slow?
Traders are here to take
advantage of the farmers!
The dam on the Sindhu river
is affecting the entire region.
Dam?
Wait... wait!
Hojo, seal the deal
with 8 sacks of wheat!
Right!
<i>Elephant tusks for your home!</i>
- I thank you.
- I am Lothar, a guard of Mohenjo Daro.
You gave your shawl
to that madman Jakhiro.
No one here does that.
No... no, please don't do this!
We are weavers from Kot Diji.
Sindhu river changed course...
and swept away our village,
our homes, our fields, everything.
Now there is no food to eat,
even the woven cloth was swept away.
This is Moonja,
the Senate Chief Maham's son!
A few cloth bundles and
threads is all that we have.
If we get 4 Lapis Lazuli in
return for our cloth...
our villagers
will be able to sustain.
Look weaver...
the fair value is 2 Lapis Lazuli.
If you want 4...
then you will have to send your
women every night to me, one by one.
Take back your words or-
The value of these goods
is 4 Lapis Lazuli...
if you do not accept...
then there is no barter.
Oh really! Who are you?
Do you know who I am?
Who you are or who I am,
does not matter!
There is only one rule of barter -
fair exchange!
Here fair is, what I deem fair!
4 Lapis Lazuli...
not one more, not one less...
or there is no deal.
What's going on here?
All traders return to your stalls.
Move! Go!
Seal the deal at 2 Lapis Lazuli!
The master is not used to bickering.
Forgive him master,
he is not from the city.
He is unaware
of the rules of Mohenjo Daro.
<i>2</i> Lapis Lazuli!
Load the goods in the cart behind.
That was close.
Do not repeat what you just did!
I may not be able
to save you the next time.
Remember, this is not your village!
I too am a farmer!
I know the hardwork
that goes into harvesting crops.
And then, he spoke of the women
as if they were goods for barter.
How could I have remained silent?
The bazaar is meant
for exchanging wares...
for our livelihood.
Uncle was right...
this city is full of greed!
Hojo! Pack your goods!
I refuse to stay in a place
where the air is impure.
- We will return to Amri!
- Go back?
If we return without the Zebu bulls,
Uncle will harness me to the plough!
Take a deep breath Sarman,
maybe the air will become pure again?
That is Chaani.
The daughter of our Priest.
Why is everyone bowing to her?
She is a symbol of Mother Sindhu's
Grace and Blessing on this city.
They say that Chaani's birth foretells the
coming of a New Order for Mohenjo Daro.
New Order?
Chaani, look at that!
Apologise to Junu!
Let it go, Chaani.
Did you not hear me?
Apologise!
Or else...
I will turn you into a toad!
A toad?
This is my final warning!
If you do not apologise...
I will turn you into a toad.
Seems like he is an outsider.
The Chosen One has never been wrong!
She has powers! She has been
granted a boon by Mother Sindhu!
Please forgive me!
Seems like she really is
blessed by Mother Sindhu.
Chaani... I did not know
you can turn a man into a toad!
Does the rain fall because I say so?
I was just trying to scare him...
but you got scared instead.
Stop staring!
""Hojo! Pack your goods! I refuse to
stay in a place where the air is impure.""
You were right, Sarman. We should
pack our stuff, let's return to Amri.
So should we leave? Or has the air
in Mohenjo Daro become pure suddenly?
Has the sparkle returned?
Idiot!
Senate Chief Maham welcomes all
traders to the Mohenjo Daro bazaar!
Maham wants the trade to increase
this year and has always worked...
towards the betterment of
this great city of Sindhu Land!
Chiefs!
The promise that I had made
to Mohenjo Daro 15 monsoons ago...
has now been fulfilled.
For a long time
Harappa was ahead of us.
Where only Harappa was looked
at for trade, in all of Sindhu Land...
it is now Mohenjo Daro
that every trader looks forward to.
I will soon destroy Harappa!
This Senate does not
agree with your rules, Maham!
Whatever may be the reasons
for Harappa's downfall...
surely, the reason for Mohenjo
Dar0's downfall will be you, Maham!
Has destroying Harappa's trade
improved the lives of this city?
No!
By constructing a dam on the Sindhu,
have we achieved anything?
No!
The streets and the walls
in the Lower City are crumbling!
Have they been fixed?
No!
In order to improve the Lower City,
we need resources...
which we do not have!
I propose an increase
in tax from the people.
Senate Chief Maham!
For 15 monsoons, the people have suffered
the consequences of your actions.
Chiefs!
To fight injustice is justice itself!
You are silent, because you do not
know the truth about Maham!
You do not know the real reason
why he was forced to leave Harappa.
That is false!
Chief of Farmers!
Remember, there is only one punishment
for disrespecting Senate Chief Maham.
Whoever is in favor of increasing
the tax, raise your palms...
those against, show your fists!
- Chief of Miners.
- Chief of Guards.
- Chief of Artists.
- Chief of Potters.
- Chief of Fishermen.
- Chief of Brick Makers.
- Chief of Bead Makers.
- Chief of Cattle Herders.
- Chief of Land Owners.
- Chief of Weavers.
- Chief of Dyers.
- Chief of Merchants.
Chief of Farmers!
The tax... will be increased!
The assembly has concluded.
Chief of Farmers!
Our conversation has not yet ended.
Speak up! What still remains
to be said, Senate Chief?
What is it that you know
that the other Chiefs do not?
The real reason for your
banishment from Harappa!
Let it be known to all the Chiefs...
that the Chief of Merchants, Maham,
has smuggled timber to the Sumerians.
In exchange, we reaped the benefit!
As punishment for this crime, I decree
that Maham be banished from Harappa.
Leave the city!
That day I vowed...
I will take revenge for
my humiliation and bring Harappa to ruin.
Ruin Harrappa? -
It is only me who decides, who will
live and who will die in Mohenjo Daro!
And you... will not live.
Yours will be a lonely death,
O Chief of Farmers!
You will be unable to protest again,
in any Senate!
Senate Chief Maham!
Let the City Music Celebrations begin!

Lothar...
does the Priest
live in the Upper City?
Yes.
Can you take us there?
No Sarman, the entry is restricted
for people of the Lower City.
Only those who have a special copper
seal are allowed inside the gate.
Will this seal do?
How did you get this seal?
What are you doing, Sarman?
Uncle had said only in
times of life and death!
It is life and death, Hojo!
I have to find her!
Try to look like you're
from the Upper City.
Why is it taking so long today?
Right.
It feels like we have
entered a different city.
There she is!
The man in the saffron clothing
is her father, the Priest.
There... you saw her!
Has your heart fluttered enough?
Now can we go back?
Easy!
Easy!
Look into my eyes!
Look into my eyes!
Easy!
I thank you!
Who are you?
Chaani! Are you alright?
I thank you!
You saved my daughter.
You handled the situation bravely!
What is your name?
You don't look like
you're from around here.
My name is Sarman.
I'm an indigo farmer.
I've come from Amri.
Perhaps it is Mother Sindhu's wish
that you are here!
- Now you better not turn and look!
- Why will I look back?!
But tell me if she does!
She - the Chosen One of Mohenjo Daro
and you - an ordinary farmer from Amri!
She turning back is like
the sun and the moon rising together.
What an unpredictable city!
You cannot even trust
the sun and the moon here!
One bag of yam
in exchange for one bag of indigo.
Sarman, is one bag of yam acceptable?
Sarman! If you continue daydreaming,
we will lose the traders!
It's the last day today...
we have to finish exchanging
the last of our goods.
Plagued by love... what else?
It turns even the wisest men
into fools!
Hojo, I must go to the shrine!
Why? They gave you a job
to mop the floor?
I do have a job...
and I will not leave Mohenjo Daro
without seeing Chaani.
The Unicorn!
Yes... it is Mother Sindhu's vehicle.
She travels on it and is able to look
over and protect all of Sindhu Land.
Everyone knows of the Unicorn today...
but there is no one living
who has ever seen it.
This animal appeared in my dream...
standing on a river bank...
as if... waiting for me!
O Priest... what does it mean?
This Unicorn...
How did this seal come
into your possession?
My Uncle gave it to me...
for my protection.
Your Uncle?
- What is his name?
- Durjan.
And... your father? Where is he?
Many monsoons ago...
both my parents died
because of the plague.
Srujan was his name.
Place that over there.
Move aside!
Make Way!
It looks like something bad
has happened again!
Chief of Farmers and his supporters.
Who has killed him?
Maham!
Why?
He was a criminal!
They were all criminals!
All criminals!
What crime did they commit?
This Lakkho... he spoke the truth!
That was his crime!
That Sambhi... he asked for justice!
That was his crime!
Even I spoke for Mohenjo Daro
but Maham took all that was mine!
Now no more protests!
Why are the remains
left here like this, Lothar?
Why were they not given
their final rites?
We are not allowed...
to burn or to bury!
And whoever tried,
met the same fate!
Humans attacking animals
for survival, this I have seen...
I too have killed a crocodile
with my own hands!
But humans killing humans...
this I have never seen
nor heard of, Lothar!
And to be witness
and yet remain silent...
this I cannot do!
You are a guard, Lothar!
How can you watch this injustice
and do nothing about it?!
It is not so simple, Sarman!
I have some connection
with this city, Hojo!
Or else, why would the Unicorn
appear in my dreams?
Why did Uncle Durjan
have that seal...
which only those from
the Upper City have?
Why does this city
look so familiar to me?
Feel like my own?
Until I find the answers
to these questions...
I will not leave!
Hear! Hear!
Listen to the new tax laws!
All of Mohenjo Daro is aware that
the Sindhu changing course...
has caused a lot of problems
in the Lower City.
And for that reason,
Senate Chief Maham has sanctioned...
an increase in taxes
for the people of Mohenjo Daro!
How can I give more tax?
Do I feed my children
from the little I have left...
or place it
in the feet of this monster.
I don't want Maham's help...
I cannot tolerate it any more.
But there is no other way...
if you don't obey Maham's command,
you will be killed!
Listen up... messenger of Maham!
Tell your Chief Maham...
that the people of Mohenjo Daro
will not pay more tax.
Who are you, you lunatic?
Go tell Maham...
the people of Mohenjo Daro
will not obey his command.
Foolish man!
The consequence
of going against Maham... is death!
But to accept an increase in tax
is also death!
The death of my children!
The death of my family!
I rather die at the hands of Maham
than see my children die of hunger.
Who all agree with me?
- Yes! He is right!
- I agree with him!
I do not want to pay
the additional tax!
We will not pay!
I have never seen
that man before.
This has not happened
in twenty monsoons!
Where did this audacity come from?
Kulka, find out...
who he is!
Right away.
The wind has stopped to listen,
even the fish are staring at you...
say something, Chaani!
Anymore silence and the Sindhu river
will shy away from the city!
How can I describe something
that I have never felt before, Junu?
It feels like rain drops
passing through the sun rays...
rendering the sky with colors.
This is all that Amri boys fault.
He may have saved your life
but he took your heart instead!
Boy?
Which boy?
The same boy
you've been daydreaming about!
Don't even think about him, Chaani!
What if you fall in love?
Your father gave his word
in Mother Sindhu's presence...
which cannot be broken!
I am aware...
but it's no longer
in my control, Junu!
But when did all this happen?
Tell me something, Junu.
Till now I have been thought
of as everyone's protector!
But who has ever protected me?
When he controlled those animals...
he also took control of my heart!
My breaths grew deeper
and I just stood there staring.
I feel I've got wings, Junu...
I've started to fly!
Everything seems so different...
I do not know what to make of this!
No Chaani!
This can never be!
This love story has to stop!
- Or else the Sindhu will...
- Let the Sindhu flow away!
Junu, I must meet him!
Right now!
But where will I find him?
I don't even know
where to look for him!
If he is still in the Lower City...
he must be waiting
for the cattle herders of Dholavira.
We could find him
in the cattle bazaar tomorrow.
So... let's go to the cattle bazaar!
Chaani, you should not be here
looking like this.
I'm worried! If someone recognises you,
we'll be in big trouble.
Let us see!
No one recognises me...
or is even looking at me!
Do not be worried, Junu!
Now let's go find him.
It would be best
if he does not recognise you either!
Let's go.
Let's take this pair, Sarman.
That pair is too short tempered.
Hojo, she is smiling!
Smiling?
Is she smiling?
You have begun to take a liking
to every girl in this city.
Will you keep staring
or will you say something too?
Sarman, the goats are done
and that pair of bulls-
Chaani, happy to see him?
You're in the middle of the market,
not in private... anything can...
It's a clay bird... I made it.
You did not wear your headdress today,
but I instantly recognised you.
I wanted to see you.
You wanted to see me?
Without your headdress,
you look even more beautiful!
You know something?
Everything feels so different
without my headdress.
No one recognises me!
No one is bowing before me!
I do not have to bless anyone
or save anyone!
I can do whatever I like!
And do you know
why this is happening?
Why?
Because of you!
- Because of me?
- Yes.
If I had not met you,
I would not have found myself!
Will you come see the city with me?
Me?
Yes... let's go...
come on!

through and through!</i>
<i>Your speech fills and thrills my heart</i>
<i>Your conversation gives
my dreams a start</i>
<i>When I see you,
sure does my heart beat faster</i>
<i>And I court a sweet disaster!</i>
<i>This rustling breeze
rushing away in all the quarters</i>
<i>My heart flees alike</i>
<i>This breeze</i>
<i>Rustling... liberty it encounters!</i>
<i>O heart, take wings, rustle with glee,
town after town, in all quarters let me flee</i>
Kulka has seen you with him!
He's coming right this way!
Kulka... who is that?
He is Maham's most loyal servant!
Maham will know we were here together.
$0?
Come on Chaani!
There is no time to talk!
Kulka has seen him as well.
He is also in danger, Junu!
Come with me...
Come on.
Make this the official trade seal
in all of Sindhu Land!
Who is this rebel?
Who has the audacity
to disobey my command?
I could not find him yet,
Senate Chief...
but I have news about the Chosen One!
I just saw her with some man.
Scholar...
I want you to decide the day
for Chaani and Moonja's union.
Chaani cannot be wed until
after the Moon Bath, Senate Chief.
They are clean now!
Where were you?
I had gone to look for Chaani.
She is not in the Shrine!
You won't find her there today.
Tonight, there is a Moon Ritual
at the Great Bath.
Until the ritual is over,
Chaani cannot return to the Shrine.
Moon Ritual?
Yes... it's the lover's-alliance night.
Any boy and girl, who confess their love
under the full moon tonight...
then their Union is sealed.
Really?
Then I have to meet Chaani tonight!
You cannot go there, Sarman!
What if Moonja recognises you?
Lothar is right!
But I will still go!
Sarman, have you lost your mind?!
My mind, my sleep,
I have lost everything, Hojo!
I have to tell her tonight,
that she is my beloved!
What has lshme-Dagan
brought for us from Sumer?
(Ancient Sumer language)
Moonja, strike this stone dagger!
On this?
Amazing!
It is a sword made of Copper!
- Is the Gold ready, Maham?
- Only a few more suns, lshme-Dagan.
Once the digging in
the riverbed is complete...
then you will receive
the decided amount of Gold.
My ships are waiting at Dholavira
with your goods, Maham!
How many more suns must we wait?
I have been waiting for
this for 20 monsoons, lshme-Dagan!
Believe me,
my need for these weapons is...
far greater than
your need for the Gold!
I am afraid you will have to wait...
for this!
Right! I thank you.
There is a ritual in honor of
Mother Sindhu in the Great Bath.
You must not have seen
anything like this in Sumer.
Tonight on the occasion
of the full moon...
young men and women
will confess to their beloveds.
And then, the Chosen One, Chaani...
will immerse the figurine
of the Deity in the water.
By this ritual, the companions
and the future of the city...
will be blessed by Mother Sindhu.
<i>O Mother Sindhu</i>
<i>Flow as you've ever flown</i>
<i>When we're forlorn</i>
<i>Woebegone</i>
<i>And to thee alone share</i>
<i>Do lend an ear... hear!</i>
<i>O listen</i>
<i>Listen to this call, ye too</i>
<i>Do listen!</i>
<i>In the hamlet of thy heart beats
the strange dum-dum of the drum</i>
<i>For thee live I, and thee for me,
yes together let us live</i>
<i>Sweetheart, my body, my mind, my riches
and life as well, for you alone do I nourish</i>
<i>My earth and my firmament
for thee I cherish</i>
<i>You are my whole wide world</i>
<i>My self and all my love
is for you alone furled</i>
<i>You are as though
the world's colour and glow</i>
<i>The spring
and my season's everything</i>
<i>You're the one,
you're the one!</i>
<i>Through the sky well high flows
this silken moonlight</i>
<i>And upon the earth your flame bright</i>
<i>Some desire inordinate
has dissolved in the eyes passionate</i>
<i>There's none like thee</i>
<i>You are
my whole wide world</i>
<i>My self and all my love
is for you alone furled</i>
<i>Walking along, some pathway
suddenly meets a turn blind</i>
<i>In a single moment one walks
on lea ving everything behind</i>
<i>My star is alit, my heart roaming
around like a nomad</i>
<i>Now that my heart has heard
the love-laden melody, it spins</i>
<i>Close but silent,
why so tight-Iipped are you?</i>
<i>Let me at least ask,
who are you?</i>
<i>Let the eyes do the talking,
struck dumb I am</i>
<i>Hear with eyes,
I'm telling you who I am</i>
<i>You are my whole wide world</i>
<i>My self and all my love</i>
<i>Is for you alone furled</i>
<i>You are my whole wide world</i>
<i>My self and all my love</i>
<i>Is for you alone furled</i>
Sarman!
What are you doing here?!
Why have you come here?
Chaani...
I will not leave before the questions
that trouble my heart, are answered.
What questions?
When I left Amri...
I did not know
where my journey would take me.
But I know now
that with every step...
I was coming closer to you!
You are my beloved, Chaani...
do you also feel the same?
Yes.
Chaani?
Chaani?
I am changing.
Right.
- I wanted to ask you a few questions.
- I am listening.
Why were you roaming the bazaar
without your headdress?
Who was with you?
What is the meaning
of your questions, Moonja?
I was with... Junu.
Your clothes are lying out here!
Your clothes are lying out here!!
I know and I also know
the boundaries of modesty.
Leave,
so that I may come out.
Right.
How dare you?
How can you take advantage
of someone's innocence?!
Advantage?
I took advantage of you?
Were you not hinting at me
with your doe like eyes.
- What else could I do?
- I was looking at you with anger!
I made a mistake,
your eyes are very mischievous...
they want one thing,
but they say something else.
Do you now understand...
how it feels when someone
takes advantage of you?
No I did not.
Show me again.
No!
This is not right!
I cannot do this!
Why?
- This is inappropriate!
- What is inappropriate, Chaani?
We cannot be together, Sarman!
It has already been decided.
What is decided, Chaani?
That“
I will be Moonja's companion!
Moonja's companion?
When was this decided?
When I was born.
When a mother dies
during child birth...
the new born is considered
an omen in Mohenjo Daro.
People walked away
without even looking at my face.
Then, a Scholar from
the Senate arrived.
This child is the blessing
of Mother Sindhu...
she is the Chosen One
of Mohenjo Daro.
The future of this great city
rests on her decisions.
There will come a time...
when your daughter
will usher in a New Order.
When Maham found out that
I was blessed by Mother Sindhu...
he and his companion arrived
at our doorstep with fanfare!
And in front of
all the Upper City elders...
he proclaimed that I will be
Moonja's companion when I came of age.
This Union is decided, Sarman...
no one can change it!
There is no situation
that cannot be changed!
Go!
The other way.
This way!
Go!
What?
What...?
And did you also...?
Chaani... this is not right!
What if Moonja finds out?!
Senate Chief Maham!
I welcome you to the Shrine,
Senate Chief.
The Moon Ritual is now over, Priest.
The time has come that
you fulfill your promise!
Maham, only a few more monsoons,
Chaani is still very innocent.
She's not so innocent.
The rumors of her new
'company' are being heard.
Now, to wait for even
one more sunrise is too long!
Maham, just a little while longer,
I will speak to Chaani.
This is an order,
not a request Priest!
And you are aware of
the consequences, if you disobey me.
Were you not Chaani's father...
Make preparations!
Chaani's Union with Moonja
will take place after two suns.
Looking at you,
brings back memories of my Union.
Without you saying a word...
I know that
you don't like Moonja.
True, I am Maham's companion...
but my presence makes
no difference to anybody.
But I know everything, Chaani.
My son is a little rough
like his father...
but I am very happy...
because if you are with him,
then my son might change.
Once you become his companion.
Junu, you stay here with Chaani.
When it is time for the ceremony,
I will come to take her!
Sarman!
People of Mohenjo Daro...
Moonja and Chaani's Union
will usher in a New Order...
and that is why
it is my decision...
that Moonja will be
the next Senate Chief.
And the New Order
of Mohenjo Daro will begin.
What are you doing here?
Why are you agreeing
to be Moonja's companion...
when you do not love him!
I don't have the freedom
to choose my companion, Sarman!
I am only fulfilling father's promise.
No Chaani!
Not your father's promise.
You are following
Maham's command.
Companions come together
because of a Union of the hearts...
and your heart
has not chosen Moonja!
You do not understand, Sarman.
What if... because of
my Union with Moonja...
I am able to rid Mohenjo Daro
of it's troubles.
What if... this Union leads us
to the New Order...
which everyone
has been dreaming of?
Chaani, but...
do you really believe
that because of this...
you will be able to save this city?
He is only using you!
And how can a Union that
makes Maham more powerful...
usher in a New Order?
Do not be afraid of Maham, Chaani!
I am with you!
Chaani... hurry up!
We are running out of time!
Maham is not used to hearing a no!
And till today whoever has
opposed him, has been silenced.
If I break this Union today...
then father and all of Mohenjo Daro
will have to suffer the consequences.
You will have to become the
Chosen One now, on whose decisions...
the people of Mohenjo Daro
place their faith!
- Sarman, you go!
- Listen to your heart, Chaani...
the way I listened to mine
and came here.
Be fearless... whatever choice you make,
It will be right!
Moonja!
- Moonja!
- Silence!
Junu, tell father immediately!
It is the Chosen One's Union!
How can we not be allowed to enter!
You cannot do this!
Let us inside!
Get him, Sarman!
Stop Moonja!
Stop!
Who are you?
How dare you raise your hand on the
future Senate Chief of Mohenjo Daro?
And to top that, this scoundrel has been
eyeing the girl who is betrothed to me.
So you are the one who instigated
the people to refuse the tax.
For these crimes, this man will be
sentenced this instant...
the death penalty!
Forgive him!
He is not from around here.
He has done this out of ignorance.
He is not familiar with the rules
and norms of Mohenjo Daro!
Do not carry the burden of
his death on your head, Maham!
No!
He should not be forgiven.
He should be put on a staff...
or I should be allowed to behead him!
No, Moonja!
Play with fire but
do not burn yourself!
They have seen my cruelty,
now they will see my kindness.
The Priest has pleaded forgiveness
for this man.
I will respect his wishes!
My decision is...
that this man should be given
a chance to save himself!
He will have to pass a test!
What kind of test, Senate Chief?
The test that is considered to be the
epitome ofjustice in Mohenjo Daro!
The test of Bakar Zokaar!
Bakar Zokaar?
Whatever your test is,
laccepfl
But I have one wish.
A wish?
You mean death wish!
So consider it a death wish then!
What is that?
If I win...
Chaani will be set free
from this Union.
She will not be
Moonja's companion!
Iaccepu
Till Mother Sindhu
does not do justice...
there will be no celebration
in Mohenjo Daro!
Bring him!
Stop the test of Bakar Zokaar, Moonja.
I will willingly be your companion!
You are already my companion,
so what kind of deal is this?
Let him go, Moonja!
He's just a commoner.
Commoner?
This 'commoner' humiliated me!
He will have to die an animal's death
in the presence of the entire city.
I want to see the people
hear his screams!
He will have to go through
the test of Bakar Zokaar!
Let's go, Chaani!
Kunnu, Dheeru...
call the healer!
It is not he who has commited the crime,
it is me, Mother!
If you have not given me the right
to fall in love...
then why did you make me meet him?
Why did you make me
fall in love with him?
If the punishment for our Union is death,
then take my life... instead of his!
Take my life!
What happened was not good.
Sarman, I am here
to tell you something...
that is important
for you to know.
And what is that?
The Senate Chief of Mohenjo Daro,
before Maham...
his name was...
u.
Your father!
My father...?
Senate Chief of Mohenjo Daro...?
How can this be?
We are from Amri.
Your Uncle Durjan lied to you
about your father's death.
But what choice did he have?
He did not have the courage
to tell you the truth.
Truth about?
Srujan was the greatest Senate Chief
Mohenjo Daro had ever seen.
Maham was the Chief of Merchants then.
He struck a deal
with the Sumerians in secret...
and then made
a proposition in the Senate.
As the Sindhu River
comes down the mountain...
in this region here,
there are deposits of a yellow metal...
that shines like
the rays of the sun.
Gold!
You will not find this
anywhere else.
My proposition is to build a dam
and halt the waters of the Sindhu...
and then mine the Gold
buried in the riverbed.
A dam?
But then how will the river flow?
It will flow Jakhiro...
and for that we will dig
a new path for the river...
which will rejoin here.
We should not do this.
Sindhu River is akin to our Mother!
To halt her waters will be
against the Sindhu Order!
If the dam forces the river
to turn away from the city...
where will we get water
for drinking and farming.
Sindhu is no small stream...
it is a huge river.
An ordinary dam will not be
able to change its course.
But because of the Gold, all the
foreigners who go to Harappa...
will be attracted to Mohenjo Daro.
Trade will grow,
the people will benefit...
there will be contentment!
Wide roads, better houses...
Mohenjo Daro will become
much stronger than Harappa.
Maham!
Do not mislead the Senate by
building dreams out of thin air!
Those who agree with me
raise your palms...
those who agree with Maham,
show your fists!
I Jakhiro, am with Srujan!
I am with Maham!
I am with Srujan!
I am with my brother,
Senate Chief Srujan!
7 are with me, 7 are with Maham.
Priest, now you speak!
And in fear of Maham, I did exactly
what I should not have done...
- and Maham won the vote.
- The dam will be built on Sindhu River!
And then?
The dam's construction
on the Sindhu began.
The people worked
tirelessly for their city...
unaware of Maham's treachery.
At times with cunning
and at times by force...
Maham turned everyone
against Srujan!
Those who did not
fall for the greed of Gold...
were silenced by
the fear of his bandits.
Summoned from the Kirthar mountains...
those bandits became protectors,
not only of Maham, but also of the city!
The river took a new course
and the hidden Gold was revealed.
But your father was still
concerned about the dam.
Maham has betrayed us all!
The dam is so big that the river
will be forced to turn away!
We need to stop this!
Stop work!
If this dam is made, then Mother Sindhu
will turn away from the city.
Keep working!
Srujan...
Maham falsely accused Srujan...
and by some treachery,
Maham hid Gold in Srujan's house...
and then had him arrested.
Citizens! This traitor is not fit
to be called Senate Chief!
He is a criminal!
A criminal of the entire city!
He should be given the death penalty!
Death penalty!
This is not true!
Do not let him mislead you!
He is a fraud!
He will destroy Mohenjo Daro!
Priest! Say something!
You know me since we were boys...
I would never wish harm
upon Mohenjo Daro!
Speak!
And what did you say?
I just stood there,
staring at his face...
I was helpless,
Chaani had no one but me.
And Uncle Durjan?
He too knows the truth!
Durjan tell them!
Tell everyone, Durjan.
Why are you quiet, Durjan?
Tell people the truth!
I don't know anything!
Death penalty!
And Mother...
- what happened to her?
- The trauma was too much for her...
she could not bear
the shock and died.
And then?
Maham took the Senate
under his control...
and proclaimed himself
as the Senate Chief.
Then he began stripping
the Sindhu Order of its principles...
and violated its rules of
conduct and trade.
And what Srujan had said,
came true.
Because of the dam,
the Sindhu River began to turn away...
and many villages ran dry.
The villagers started to migrate
to Mohenjo Daro.
The city grew,
the number of people increased...
and under their pressure,
Mohenjo Daro began to crumble.
The Maham Order had begun.
Whoever supported him
was given Gold...
the rest were given death.
Srujan did not commit any crime.
We did!
I did!
The cause of Srujan's death
was not Maham...
it was me!
I cannot even ask for your
forgiveness, Sarman!
How can I?
That is why everything
seemed so familiar.
I was born here.
I spent my childhood here.
My father gave his life
for this city...
and this city gave him death.
It was imperative that I tell you
the truth about your past, Sarman!
May Mother Sindhu protect you
and give you strength!
Tomorrow, when you face
Bakar Zokaar in the arena...
remember that the
bigger enemy is Maham...
who spilled the blood of your family
and shook the foundation of this city.
Only you can save your father's city
from destruction, Sarman!
Only you can stop Maham!
This is my city.
Mohenjo Daro!
Duflan!
Here are your goods!
Sarman stayed back in wait of
the cattle herders of Dholvaira.
He will return only
when he has the bulls and goats.
Why did you leave him behind, Phulji?
Just as you were unable
to stop him from leaving...
I was unable to
stop him from staying.
I'll take your leave.
I'm getting worried...
do you think he found out?
I do not know...
Attention!
Today, we carry out
the most cruel sentence.
A criminal must be punished!
He will face Bakar and Zokaar!
The boon of life
or the curse of death!
Truth will win
and falsehoods will lose!
Bring the prisoner!
Weapons!
He will choose the trident!
Bring in Bakar and Zokaar!
Ishme-Dagan,
this is Bakar and Zokaar!
They are both man-eaters brought
from the mountains of Tajik.
They strike only to kill,
only to satiate their hunger.
(Tribal language)
That means death.
Bakar Zokaar will not survive now.
Zokaafl
Sarman... Sarman...
This is the meaning
of your coming here Sarman!
You are the savior of Mohenjo Daro!
And if the people
were to learn who you are...
they will stand by you!
You are the only hope, Sarman...
or else the future generations
will never know...
<i>the truth or the goodness
of Moherfyo Dare.</i>
Moonja.
You are to be the next
Senate Chief of Mohenjo Daro!
But I can already
sense defeat in you!
I will not let my son be defeated
without spilling any blood.
If you want to live in
a garden of flowers...
you must first
weed out the wild plants.
The Priest?
The Priest... and Chaani!
We no longer have any
use for the two of them.
No father...
Chaani is not to blame,
Sarman is!
He has misled Chaani!
His neck was in my hands,
only if-
Now the fire in my body
will only be doused by his blood!
Chaani is mine!
Open your eyes, Moonja!
Love will make you weak, Moonja!
Do not focus on love,
rule instead!
Soon, Mohenjo Daro will be yours...
the entire Sindhu Land
will be yours...
any girl you set
your eyes on, will be yours!
But first, make use of
these weapons, Moonja!
And spill the blood
of that Chosen One...
of the Priest...
of Sarman...
let none of them
see the next sunrise.
Moonja!
Father!
Father!
Run!
Father!
If not to me,
then you belong to no one!
We must tell them
the truth, Sarman!
Everyone listen!
Sarman has a very deep
connection to Mohenjo Daro.
My father had learned this...
and that is why,
before the test of Bakar and Zokaar...
my father told Sarman the truth.
- And what is that, Chaani?
- The truth is...
that Sarman is the son
of the Senate Chief, Srujan!
I knew it!
This youth of Amri
was born on this very land!
Duflan?
And my father was confident that when
the people would learn the truth...
then they would come together
and stand behind Sarman!
Yes!
Maham blinded us by creating an
illusion of a great Mohenjo Daro...
but now,
our eyes have been opened!
We made a mistake once...
not again!
O son of Srujan...
we are ready to fight!
Show us the way...
we are with you, Sarman!
Right!
First of all...
we must heal the wounds
that run deep.
All those people who gave
their lives for Mohenjo Daro...
we will honor their sacrifice.
We will give their remains
their last rites.
Yes, Sarman!
You are right! Let's go!
First, we must give him peace!
Senate Chief Srujan!
He had always spoken the truth!
My father!
So many monsoons have passed!
Why did you not
tell me about my past?
I was afraid, Sarman.
I had already lost Srujan...
I was afraid
that I would lose you too.
Forgive me, Sarman.
I was weak.
I did not have your father's courage!
Forgive me!
We were always worried
about your well being...
back then and even now.
Forgive us!
We cannot change the past, Aunt Bima.
We can now only look to the future!
Make preparations for
the last rites of my son!
According to Harappan tradition...
we will put his body
in flowing water.
You and I have no
relation to Harappa!
We are related by birth!
That relation was broken
many monsoons ago!
Who broke this relation?
You betrayed them!
For what do you seek revenge?!
And till when will
you keep seeking it?
These weapons will not
bring your son back!
This yellow metal cannot
give you your revenge!
Laashfl
The cause of every problem in
Mohenjo Daro... is your greed, Maham!
The death of my son is
also because of your greed!
Do you know who Sarman is?
He is Srujan's son!
You put his father on a staff
and he killed your son!
This is the justice of the Sindhu!
You are responsible
for the death of your son, Maham!
Now whatever you do, you cannot
stop your own destruction!
Srujan's son?
Sarman is Srujan's son?!
Many monsoons ago the Sindhu river
used to flow through here.
Quickly...
Work quickly!
Before the sunrise tomorrow...
we have to dispatch
the bullcarts to Dholavira.
Let's g0!
Work quickly!
Load the sacks of Gold
onto the bullcarts!
Sarman, despite knowing everything,
I continued to serve Maham.
Now I want to serve Mohenjo Daro.
Tell us, what must we do?
The traders from Sumer have left
with their carts full of Gold.
We must stop them!
This is our only chance
to expose Maham's betrayal.
- Right! When do we leave?
- Now!
Ishme-Dagan!
This path will lead you
straight to Dholavira.
I thank you.
What is the matter?
- I am only a trader!
- You are a smuggler!
The next time you smuggle your
weapons into Sindhu Land...
you will have to face me!
Bhanu!
Listen carefully!
Go to the dam and wait there,
keep your eyes on the water.
If you see any signs of trouble,
come and tell me.
Right? Go!
- Right.
Senate Chief!
Sarman and his supporters
have taken the Gold!
What?!
They have also taken Kulka prisoner!
Now, they are bringing him
in front of the people!
How could this have happened?
Before the sun reaches the top...
Kulka and Sarman,
should not be left alive.
<i>'</i> Go!
_ Let's go!
Listen!
Inform all the Chiefs...
the Senate will
assemble immediately.
Till now, Maham had you believe
that in exchange of Gold...
we will get goods, which we can
use in the upkeep of the city.
But this was not the case!
In exchange for this Gold, Maham was
trading this with the Sumerians.
Weapons of Copper!
And on the strength
of these weapons...
he was going to launch
an attack on Harappa!
He wants to take revenge
for his humiliation.
And this is the reason why Maham
had proposed to build the dam.
The time has come for us to raise
our palms and turn them into fists.
Yes!
Let's charge towards the Senate!
Everyone knows the truth
about you, Maham!
No one stands with you anymore!
Your crimes end here and now.
Who will end me?
Who has the courage to...
You have invited death, Sarman!
Whoever opposed me was killed!
I put even Srujan on the staff!
The blood that you have spilled
the same blood runs in my veins!
I am your end, Maham!
Kill him!
Strike him!
In exchange for his head,
you will get Gold!
He has nothing to give you!
The people have taken over everything,
your gold rig and your weapons!
You are alone, Maham!
Completely alone.
No!
Do not be misled by him!
I am still the Senate Chief
and you work for me!
We do not work for you, Maham,
but for gold!
It is clear to me that you have
nothing left to offer!
So now that you have gold,
you consider yourself powerful?
Your greed to rule is making
you do this, Sarman!
What then is the difference
between me and you?!
There is a difference, Maham!
You want to rule
over Mohenjo Daro...
and I want to serve it...
like my father used to do.
This is my city, Maham!
This is my father,
Srujan's city!
Chiefs of the Senate...
the ones who stand by Maham,
raise your palms...
but those who oppose,
show your fists!
The new Senate Chief of
Mohenjo Daro, will be Sarman!
Yes!
No.
Mohenjo Daro will no longer
be ruled by a Senate Chief...
but by its people.
Take him!
Come on.
Death penalty!
Come on, hurry up!
Death penalty!
Sarman!
The water is flowing
over the Dam!
Do not be afraid!
Listen to me carefully!
Take your belongings
and go to the River Gate.
Take your livestock with you
but leave the carts behind.
Everyone, we will have to
leave Mohenjo Daro!
The river can
no longer be stopped.
It will break the dam

and in its wake,
Mohenjo Daro will be destroyed.
There is very little time, go now!
Get your things! Go!
What you started,
will be your undoing!
Take me with you!
Sarman,
how can you leave me here?
How can you leave me?
How can you leave me and go?!
Sarman!
The beginning of the New Sindhu Order!
We are here. We have
to make our way there.
The flow of the water
took the hay bale here...
which means we have to drop
the boats in the water over here.
We have to somehow take a rope
to the other end and get it back.
No matter what, we have to take
the people to safety, up on that hill.
We will have to make a boat bridge,
from this bank to that one.
Chief of Miners,
I need lots of rope, gather it.
Lothar,
you will stay here.
Uncle Durjan, bring the fittest of
the Zebu bulls to the Main Gate.
Hojo, get me bullcart wheels,
at least four.
And assemble all the boats here!
There is very little time! Go!
Go quickly!
Mother Sindhu!
Protect us!
Hurry! Do not leave the rope!
Row faster!
Hurry!
Sarman!
Hojo!
Pull!
We still have to take
this rope to that side.
Tie here...
Sarman, be careful!
- Tie this rope over there.
- Right.
Lothar! Remove this,
tie it to the first boat.
Tie it, quick!
Give more slack!
- Quickly!
- Bring it!
Hurry up and turn it!
- Everyone ready?
- Yes!
Lothar... pull!
Boats in the water!
Pull... pull...
Pull...
Keep the rope straight.
Pull...
Pull...
Pull...
Do not let go!
LockiL
It's done... let's go... it's done!
Many many thanks!
Quickly... quickly!
Uncle Durjan,
you and Hojo stay this side.
Lothar, come with me.
Come on!
Let's go!
Move faster!
Move faster!
Carefully!
Keep walking!
Hurry... hurry...
Jakhiro! Come on!
No Sarman... you go!
I was born here
and I will die here.
No Jakhiro!
Listen to me, come on.
This is my privilege,
the privilege to watch Maham die!
<i>Jakkfwds Mohefiyo Dare,

Sarman, are you alright?
Mohenjo Daro will rise again!
This water is clean, pure!
From now on,
this will be our homeland!

Ram Kapoor is a rich city boy born to billionaire parents Siddhant and Ashwini and brought up in Australia. On the other hand, Sona Singh is a traditional, simple desi girl from Punjab who is brought up by her only brother, Raghuveer Singh. Raghu is heartbroken when their father marries another woman and throws them out of the house, humiliating them on the way. Their mother dies, and her tomb is built on the small land they own until Lala, their Zamindar, tells them that it is his land since their mother had taken a loan from the man. Raghuveer volunteers to work day and night to pay off the loan as long as they do not tear down his mother's tomb. Jaiswal agrees, and the local station master Shankar helps them. Slowly, Raghu and Sona grow up. One day, Ria Bhargav, Sona's best friend, comes to their house to invite Sona to their house as she is getting married. Ram also arrives on the same day with Ashwini, whose brother Krishna Kant Bhargav is Ria's father.

Slowly, Ram and Sona fall in love, but Ashwini does not bear it as Sona is not as rich as them and is thus not to their standards; Ram is also to be married to Krishna Kant's business partner Jay Prakash's daughter, Dolly. Ashwini humiliates Sona as well as Raghu, who arrives a minute before, and both are thrown out of the house after Ashwini accuses them of trying to entice and trap Ram. When Ram learns of this, he goes to Sona's house and pleads with Raghu to accept him. Raghu gives him a chance, just like he was given a chance by Lala when he was little. Ram is tasked to take care of the cows, clean up after them, and grow more crops than Raghu by the end of the season; if he does not, Ram will be thrown out of the village and can never see Sona again.

Lala and his son Ajay are not happy, as Ajay wants to marry Sona. With them and Dolly and her father trying to get Ram to lose the competition, Ram has to work hard for his love, eating red chillies and rice every day, even though he cannot bear it. Through many antics from Lala’s side and Jay Prakash’s side, Ram eventually proves his love for Sona to Raghu and succeeds in growing more grains. However, Rao, Jay Prakash, Ajay, and Lala kidnap Sona, and then later they try to forcibly marry her to Ajay. Ram kills Rao and Ajay, and Raghu brutally beats Jay Prakash and Lala. Raghu, after realising that Ram and Sona should be together, takes the blame for this and spends seven years in prison. The film ends with Raghu's release from prison, which is also when Sona and Ram get married, in everyone's presence. Ashwini then accepts Sona as her daughter-in-law.",2611,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt2357926.srt","Hello.
Okay, sir. Okay.
Raghuveer, You're still awake.
Surprisingly,
For the first time in seven years,
I am seeing you smile.
You will be released tomorrow.
That's why you are happy, isn't it?
I'll be seeing my
sister after a long time.
Can't explain how happy I am.
You really love your sister, Don't you?
- Yes!
In all these years,
you never met your family
Neither did you speak to them,
You're a good man
How you landed up here?
I have spent seven years in this jail.
But, my story dates back even longer.
I was just 11 years old.
I was visiting the temple with
my mother and younger sister.
He's my son Raghuveer
and my daughter Sona.
Please make an offering
in their name, Priest.
Sure dear.
Mom, you promised to
take me to my father.
That's where we're going, son.
Here's the offering.
Won't you offer the coconut, dear?
I completely forgot, Priest.
- Do it now.
'My mother used to say'
'... a rotten coconut brings bad luck.'
'And, that's exactly what happened.'
'My father had married someone else.'
'He humiliated my mother.'
- Get out of here!
'And broke all ties with us.'
'My mother couldn't take this betrayal.'
'She was completely shattered.'
'She kept weeping the
entire day with us in tow.'
'And, left us forever.'
Mother. Mother.
What happened?
Who is she?
She's my mother.
She's dead.
- Dead!
Pay your homage.
Here you go, Priest.
- Bless you.
Stop!
Who put this tomb here?
This field belongs to them.
Why are you bothered?
I own this field.
His mother had taken a loan from me.
So, the council has decided,
I can seize this field.
Get rid of this tomb, now!
I'll repay your debt.
Don't break my mother's tomb.
He says he will repay your debt.
Give him a chance.
At first, his father eloped.
Then his mother died.
He's still a kid. How
will he repay my debt?
He'll plough the field and pay you back.
- Him?
I'll toil day and night.
And repay your entire debt.
Otherwise, I will repay your debt.
Fine. Every year the
involvement should reach me on time.
Its installment, not involvement.
- Whatever.
Let's go.
Sir!
Don't cry, Sona.
Mother used to say, that
star is you and that's me.
Come on.
Come on.
Don't worry, Raghu.
Your sister's going to top her exams.
Break the coconut.
Wow! There's a flower inside.
She's definitely going to excel now.
Sona.
Sona. Your books.
Hey! Be careful.
You know she'll drop
them if you interrupt her.
Gauri, its my exam today,
I won't need them.
Take them along, Sona.
You can score better if you copy.
You're too much.
- Is it?
Let's go.
You remember everything, right?
- Yes.
Concentrate on your studies.
And, do well in your exams.
- Yes.
Why don't you go with her?
- Why?
How many times will you tell her...
...""Do good, do good...""
Hey! A hottie just
boarded the earlier bogie.
Sona's always done well...
Where did he go?
""You've cast a spell on me.""
""My heart's fallen for you.""
""Baby, I love you.""
Come on.
""Baby, I love you.""
""Baby, I love you.""
Nice song. You sound good too.
But teasing girls is wrong.
What did he say?
Wrong!
Who are you to interfere?
Move!
See that!
I'll stab you with this.
What the...
Check... and mate.
Someday I'll definitely beat you.
I'm also waiting for that day.
Hello Uncle.
I heard your sister's taking her college exams.
- Yes.
She's pretty intelligent and smart girl.
- Yes.
Sona.
Not again, brother.
Sona, you see those stars in the sky...
That one's me and the other one's you.
Mother used to say that, correct?
That means, after Sona's marriage...
...one of the star will disappear.
Mind your own business.
And...
Brother, shall I take the
eggs to the market tomorrow?
Yes.
But be careful.
I didn't say that to her.
You keep dropping stuff.
I dropped it only twice today.
Hello!
- Priest, what brings you here at this hour?
After a long search,
I've found a suitable match for Sona.
He works on a big post
in a big American company.
Then, he'll definitely
take his bride along.
Of course, in a big airplane...
This offer's too big for us.
I don't accept it.
Huh! Anyone else would've
pounced on this opportunity.
I don't want a prince for my sister.
Then?
I want a boy that can stay
here and look after her.
Hey, Ram! Where are you?
- On the beach.
On the beach, with the girls?
All by yourself.
You didn't invite me.
You've become selfish.
- Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
That's my trick.
This is what I do
when your mom scolds me.
Hello. I can't hear you.
- Okay.
Enjoy yourself. Have fun.
- Thanks, dad.
Wow! He heard this though.
I heard you made a donation...
...to the Royal Australian Orphanage.
It's a petty amount.
10,000 Dollars.
You call that a petty amount.
You could've spent that
money for PR activities.
Could've thrown a party
for your business colleagues.
Think about the profits.
We anyways throw parties.
Stop wasting money on useless things.
You know I don't like it.
Hi, dad.
Bad mood.
Tell me.
I'm your best friend.
Mom yelled at you again?
Thank you very much.
- Why?
For not asking whether
she beat me up or not.
You know how she is,
then, why the long face?
- I'm not upset.
Do you know why the world's
greatest philosopher was happy?
Because he knew how to
tolerate his tormenting wife.
Angry bird!
Hello.
It wasn't for you.
I was talking about Socrates' wife.
Hello, brother-in-law.
Krishnakant speaking.
How are you?
- Trying to get along with your sister.
Whats new in that.
It's your brother from India.
Hello.
- Sister.
Yes, brother.
- How are you?
How are you?
- Everything is good.
So what's new?
Too many things, but
the biggest news is...
...Ria's getting engaged
on the 14th of this month.
So soon!
Was she in love?
- Exactly.
I objected but she cried,
so I had to agree.
But is the boy from a good family?
I mean, are they rich?
That's exactly why I agreed.
Listen.
Reach here as soon as you can.
Because you only have to
look after the arrangements.
And...
Don't forget to tell brother-in-law.
And...
- Hello, aunt. - Yes, dear
Ria speaking.
- Congratulations. How are you?
Fine, aunt, Bring Ram along too.
We haven't met since our childhood.
Sure, dear. Bye.
Ram.
- Yes, mom.
Ram. We're going to India.
India!
India!
- You aren't going.
Why?
- You've to attend a conference in US.
Don't you remember?
- Oh yeah.
America, Yo!
Stop!
Brother.
Ria, how are you?
Chocolate for you, brother.
You never forget to get
the chocolate, do you?
Welcome the bride.
- Bride?
When are you getting married?
Next Friday. That's just 15 days.
- Right.
And, you are both invited.
Of course.
We'll reach there two days in advance.
Just two days?
I have come here to take Sona right now.
Now?
- Of course.
Sona, when would you
expect me to come over...
...for your marriage?
I don't know, ask brother.
Brother!
How many days before,
you expect me to come for Sona's marriage?
At least 15 days.
- Right.
My marriage is just 15 days later.
I'm just like your sister.
Please send her along.
Please, brother.
Please.
Actually, I have never
sent her alone anywhere.
She has also never
stayed apart from you.
But you will have to send her along.
Please, brother.
Please. Please. Please.
You want to go, Sona?
I won't, if you say no.
Go on.
Be careful!
Hey my coconut, give me my money.
Hey! Hi, I'm Ram.
What's up, beautiful?
May I know your name please?
Paro.
- Hi.
Dad. Mom!
Ram!
Look what a big bouquet
I brought for you.
I... I am Bijli.
Bijli!
Nephew.
Nephew.
Uncle.
- My dear!
Put your leg down.
That's enough.
He's naughty!
What is he doing?
Who is this beauty and the beast?
She's my distant relative.
Her too.
And I'm a close one.
You...
Why aren't you saying anything?
Tell me, even a vegetable vendor
in Australia speak English?
It's okay. Don't say a word.
The policeman, maid, fruit-seller,
cleaner, everyone speaks English?
What's your problem?
- I've a bad stomach.
So, why are you telling me?
- You just asked, what's my problem.
Bijli.
Who's that?
- Ria?
Ria!
I'm not Ria.
- Why?
I'm Ria's friend.
- Why didn't you say that earlier?
It's okay.
Mistakes are common at this age.
No need to apologize.
Oh! Anklet.
Ram.
Ria!
How are you?
- Fine.
Please.
She's...
- I know she's your friend.
I mistook her for you,
and hugged her like this...
Ria!
What are you doing?
She doesn't like all this.
So, what does she like?
- Ria, where are you?
Coming.
Come on, Ram.
Come on.
Ram! No, monkey.
So what's your name?
I know you won't tell me.
My name's Ram. I'm from Australia.
People say, boys who come from out of India
are spoilt, manner less, crooks and conmen.
They're right.
I am exactly like that.
So beware.
Where's the sugar?
Sugar...
Sugar... What happened?
Why are you so scared?
- I thought that monkey's back.
Who?
- The one who has come from Australia.
He was raised in Australia.
Not every foreigner is so spoilt.
It's not his fault, its his parents...
...who raised him like this.
If I ever meet his parents,
I will question them face-to-face.
Isn't it correct aunt.
Do you know who you are talking to?
Ria's aunt.
That Australian monkey is her son.
- Is it?
""Hold...""
Need some sugar.
That's better.
""Everyone lacks a little sweetness...""
Let's go.
Welcome.
How are you, dear?
- Fine.
Hello, sister-in-law.
- Hello.
He's my partner in the construction business.
- I see.
JP. Jai Prakash.
Oh Yes. He was with
the Central Ministry for 20 years.
Please don't...
She's my sister Ashwini.
- From Australia.
Hello.
Aunt.
- She is the one with the son?
Yes. - You promised that her son and my...
- Right, right.
Then introduce me to him.
Let's go in first.
Come in.
Let's go.
Sona, look at this.
- Nice.
I have got the news from the kitchen...
That you called me a monkey.
- No!
Australian monkey.
Wow!
My mistake.
Should've called you a Gorilla.
Ria!
There he is.
Get lost.
Hi. I'm Dolly.
- Hi.
Hi, I'm Bijli.
Bijli. Bijli.
- Whatever.
Come on. Let's dance.
- Sure.
Ouch.
Everyone in India
wear saris and salwars.
And it's so colorful.
Okay, dad. Take care.
Got to go.
What are you doing in my room?
This is my room. Get out!
Sorry. My mistake.
Did you see anything?
- No, I...
Just get out.
- Thank God!
Nice horse.
Don't touch that.
Hey!
My brother gifted me that.
Please!
Your brother gave it to you?
Get out of here!
- Okay.
I have a doubt.
I troubled you so much.
Any other girl would've slapped me.
But you didn't.
Does that mean...
Something-something.
- What?
Something-something.
- Nothing.
""Touch me... Touch me.""
""Hold me... Hold me...""
Ram. You're nude.
- Now, you're nude.
I didn't know I could
have that effect on women.
""Touch me... Touch me.""
Let's begin.
Where's Ram?
- Must be around.
Dear. Ram.
Ram.
Tell her to get close to Ram.
What's wrong?
Don't worry,
She'll get too close for comfort.
""Let's see...""
""Who's got the strength.""
""Keep a firm foot ahead.""
""My friend.""
This jacket belongs to
that Australian monkey.
Ria!
Now I'll show you.
Mogambo's pleased!
I hate your name!
""Let's see...""
""Who's got the strength.""
Ram!
Have you seen Ram around?
- No.
But he isn't there.
Hi.
- Hi.
Hi, Dolly.
- You naughty.
So there you are.
- No. Here I am.
Okay, listen.
Don't make any plans for the evening.
My friends are coming over. Okay.
Ram. They're my friends.
Radhika. Rashmi.
Pooja and Aanchal.
This is my bermuda,
my t-shirt and that's my slippers.
Shut up and get back.
You keep working the entire day.
Come and sit here.
Wow!
But I didn't make this.
That's why he liked it.
She's fuming.
So, who was I talking about?
- Ram. Ram!
Ram's dad is amongst top 500
billionaires of Australia.
A big mansion.
100 acres of a plush estate.
And a private chartered plane.
You're not too far-off either, Dolly.
Of course. My dad's a billionaire too.
We've ministers for breakfast.
Actors for lunch.
And builders for evening snacks.
Does your father run a mess?
Don't mess with me.
So Ram's a billionaire and so am I.
In fact, we all are rich.
We've everything.
But what about you?
- I'm rich too.
Really? What do you have?
We've a small house back in the village.
10 acres land. 20 bulls.
25 cows. 40 hens and 100 goats.
But I also have a brother...
...who loves me more than his life.
And his love is invaluable for me.
Sona. Let's go.
- Yes.
Bye, Ram!
- Bye sona.
What are you looking at?
Don't know how, but Everyday
I see something new in Sona.
But why?
- She's something.
Something-something.
Sona's finished her studies.
Get her married this year.
I will, if I find a good match.
Yes.
My son's done his graduation in farming.
We've been getting proposals
from affluent families.
But... he wants to marry your sister.
Do you have an objection?
Sona...
- Oh! You want to take her consent.
And I will have to consult sir too.
- Yeah right.
Why are you crying on
such a happy occasion?
Soon my daughter will also get
married and leave for Australia.
You think pretty positive.
What are you doing?
I've already brought
tickets to Australia.
Hello.
Now, I'll read out
the wedding invitation.
Sri Krishnakant Bhargav's daughter Ria.
Who is that?
Sri Krishnakant Bhargav's daughter Ria.
Who is that?
Sri Krishnakant Bhargav's daughter Ria.
Priest. Please carry on.
Sri Krishnakant Bhargav's daughter Ria.
Stop this nonsense.
Why did you stop?
- He asked me to stop.
Please continue.
Continue. Continue.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Hi.
When are you getting married?
- What?
I've a friend.
He's got 10 hens, 4 bulls and a horse.
He'll be a perfect match for you.
Tea.
Bijli. What's the time?
I don't have a watch.
You don't have a brain either.
- I know.
Let's go there.
- Yes, let's go.
Sister.
You just made this party come alive.
- Thank you.
You're the star of this party.
Why are you repeating the old lines, say something new.
- That's very nice of you.
Only one thing is missing.
- What's that?
What's this?
- A small, petty necklace.
Looks pretty expensive though...
It just cost 2.5 million.
You're trying to butter.
This wasn't required.
- It's okay.
Every time I see them together.
I feel happy, sister.
I feel really content.
But I feel like puking.
I can't stand it.
Hi, guys...
- People call me Bijli Gaga...
Hey, everyone.
This is Ram. My boyfriend.
- Hey.
Come closer, Ram.
Get off me, you dirty pig.
Pig loves you!
Pig loves you!
Shiraz said that.
- No, baby, it was Prabhu.
No, it was Mr. Kumar.
So, cuddling up!
Spoilsport!
Wow!
Hi!
She's my best friend.
And she's Rinki and Jazz...
- Hi.
Ma'am, the buffet's ready.
You talk to them, I shall be back. Ok?
- Okay.
Nice party, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Why are you following me?
- My wish.
Come to the side.
Put some chicken pieces and...
- Go away.
What would people say?
That's why I am saying, come to the side.
- I won't.
Your zip is open.
You're lying.
You've a mole ten inches
below your neck. Right?
""Stranger, don't leave me.""
I told you...
Your friend's calling you.
What happened?
It's stuck.
Come on.
Thanks.
What?
- You're a monkey, but a nice one.
What? You praised me.
Not bad.
Something?
- Nothing.
Something-something.
Nothing-nothing.
Yes.
Dance with me?
Wow! Something-something?
Something-something.
He was my friend in college.
He gave me champagne to drink
on his birthday party.
I was slightly drunk.
He was shooting me.
And was also trying to kiss me.
Now he's trying to
black-mail me with that clip.
He's asked Ria for money
and herjewellery.
Otherwise, he'll upload
the clip on the internet.
That clip's on his l-pad.
Is this what you meant
by ""Something-something"".
Only someone of our age
can understand our problem.
I didn't know what to do.
That's why I talked to you.
Let's search.
- Yes.
That way.
What now?
Watch me.
Brother!
Why didn't you close the door?
Why didn't you do it?
Did you have to yell so loud?
But I...
- Wait.
Pass me that bottle of shampoo.
You want to take a bath now?
What now?
Watch him run away.
He's dangerous.
Get down.
Get down.
Think about getting out of here.
Idea!
You go this way.
The dog will chase you.
And I'll escape from her with the l-pad.
Was that ajoke?
- No, I'm serious.
Then why don't you go out.
- Hey!
He'll bite you.
I like it.
I totally like it.
Madam. Take a seat.
Go ahead. Keep it on my head.
Chill.
What now?
- Sing a song!
You like my voice so much.
It will shoo away the dog.
Turn it off.
Turn it off.
It's my phone.
Hey, Lisa.
I'm in the bathroom taking a shower.
Call you later.
She's my girlfriend.
- I didn't ask.
I thought you might.
Doesn't make a difference to me.
By the way, how many
girlfriends do you have?
14! Including you.
I am not your girlfriend!
- Girls always say the opposite.
I mean I am.
- That's what I said.
But I...
- Oh, come on.
There were other boys
and girls in the party too.
But you asked for my help.
Why?
Because you consider me a friend.
Girl, friend.
Girlfriend.
- Fine.
But not the other type.
Everyone has friends.
But only one special someone
makes a place in their heart.
I do have someone,
you must have one too.
Who is he?
Look...
- Where?
The shower's gone off.
- Great discovery.
Think of a way to get out.
Google. Google.
Idea no.2.
- What?
I'll tease the dog.
The dog will get in from here and
we'll get out from the other side.
Why didn't you think of this earlier?
So that I could say it now.
Go, go, go, go. Let's go, Sona.
Let's go.
Come on. He's gone.
Let's go.
Come on.
Hey!
- Brother!
Give me my l-Pad back.
Or else I will shoot.
- Shoot me.
No. You shouldn't shoot girls.
Shoot me.
No. Shoot me.
The gun's empty.
But I still have the gun.
Rascal, how dare you blackmail girls!
What happened?
Sorry, Ria.
Oh, my God!
Why are you bothering her? Come on.
Here's his l-Pad and phone.
Thank God!
Thanks.
- No, thank him.
No, thank Sona.
He went through a lot more trouble than me.
- No. Thank her.
Okay. Thanks to both of you.
Why should there be formalities between friends.
- Right.
It's okay, I don't mind.
Okay, Goodnight.
Ram.
Friends!
Only friends. Nothing else.
Okay, okay.
Friends.
What happened?
My glass...
Go, get the ball.
Loser! Loser! Loser!
Loser! I'll show you all.
Loser! Loser! Loser!
Please don't touch!
That was fun.
Did that horse belong to you?
- Yes.
The ball knocked it over and it broke.
Sona!
It's always been with you, right?
My brother gave this to me.
I love it more than my life.
I never thought I'd lose it someday.
Counting the stars.
I'll alsojoin.
One, two, three, four...
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...
Calculation went for a toss.
It's the same one.
The one your brother gave you.
I went through a lot of
trouble to put it back together.
It had too many marks on it.
I decorated it to cover them up.
You can take it off
if you don't like it...
It's nice.
- Thanks, Ram.
Since you didn't mention,
I thanked myself.
Okay, bye.
- Ram!
You called.
Why did you take so much trouble for me?
You want me to be honest?
- Yes.
To see this smile on your face.
Is that all?
- Yes.
Nothing else?
- No.
Not even something-something?
- No.
What?
Brother. Someone's
come between you and Sona.
Who can come between us?
Take a look for yourself.
Come with me. Come on.
Quickly.
Look.
- Where?
That's you. That's Sona.
And there's a third
star between you two.
No one can come between us.
It's just probably for a while.
Get back to work.
- If you say so.
But I was worried.
That's Sona. That's Sona's brother.
Who's the third one?
What?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Are you going to wear
glasses during the rituals?
She'll wear them even
on her wedding night.
Even if she does, the lights in
the room will be switched off.
You shouldn't talking
all this at your age.
At my age, all I can do is talk.
Not mine. Take your aunt's blessings.
Bless you.
- Mom.
Did you ever hit me?
- Why you?
She'll hit your father.
- Uncle, please.
Mom, I'm serious. Have you ever hit me?
- Never. But...
Hi, buddy. How are you?
Dad, did you ever hit me?
- What are you saying?
How can anyone think of hitting you?
What's wrong?
Okay, dad. I'll call you later.
Ram!
- What?
I am sorry, Ram!
I am sorry.
Ram. It was my mistake.
You can kiss me if you want.
Forgive me.
- Sona.
I am sorry, Ram.
I am sorry.
I am sorry.
I am also sorry, Sona.
Ram! I am very happy today.
- Me too.
What were you two thinking?
I won't find out about you two?
- Please, Ria.
Please, Ria.
While arrangements for
my marriage were on...
You two were planning your own, right?
Please, Ria.
Let me get married.
I'll get you two married too.
- Ria.
Phone.
Give it.
- Hurry up.
Or sir will give the green signal.
So much luggage?
As if your own sister's getting married.
I've a sister, but Ria doesn't have a brother.
- I see.
See you.
Hey! You forgot this.
Look after the house. Be careful.
Gauri, be careful.
What are you doing?
- Deleting your number.
Why?
I won't attend this marriage.
This marriage will get over today.
Tomorrow, everyone will return.
Leaving me and my daughter behind.
What are you looking at?
Look at me.
I see, so that's the problem.
Sister.
- Yes, brother. What is it?
Can you tell him what were
we talking about yesterday?
What?
About Ram and Dolly.
- Yes.
Mister. We accept your proposal.
But let this marriage get over.
We shall talk about it in detail.
Aunt!
- Bless you.
Let's go. The procession's arriving.
- Yes, aunty.
What are you doing?
- Give me your phone number.
Welcome. Welcome.
- Bless you.
Let that be.
Talk about cash. Money.
Where's the money?
- This way.
This way.
- Inside.
Get it out!
What are you doing?
Hey! Why do you keep troubling her?
Today's the last day to have some fun.
Once the marriage is over, There
won't be any chance to do all this.
What's wrong with you?
You're upset because you'll miss
me in Australia. Correct? - Yes.
Listen...
What are you doing?
Let go of my hand.
Ram, leave my hand.
Someone might see us.
You're always in a fun mood...
I'm going back to Australia tomorrow.
People say boys who come from out of
India are conmen, flirt and spoilt brats.
No. I am not one of them, Sona.
I love you.
As soon as I get to Australia,
I'll talk to dad about us.
And your brother too.
Dolly. Let go.
I love Ram.
- Let go!
Let go.
- I want to die.
Dear, you'll hurt yourself.
What are you doing?
Aunt...
- We should teach her a lesson
Such girls are always on a
look out to entice rich boys.
If we don't act now, we'll lose Ram.
I mean it.
Come on.
- Ram!
Come here.
- What, mom?
You will have to go
to the jewellery shop right now. - Now?
Why?
Ria's my niece.
I wanted to gift her
gold bangles on her wedding.
But I forgot to get them.
- But how am I going to choose?
Take Bijli along, if
you can't do it alone.
Bijli.
- Yes, aunt's right.
Let's go or we'll miss the wedding.
There isn't any need to hurry.
Get some nice and
expensive bangles. Okay?
Come on.
Let's go.
Aunt, would you like some tea?
How old are you?
- 20.
You look smarter for your age.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go, everyone.
Who else is there in your family?
- Just an elder brother.
What does he do?
- Farming.
Farming!
We have a poultry farm
and we sell milk too.
Did you take your brother's permission...
...to attend this wedding?
- Yes, aunt.
I never do anything
without my brother's permission.
Then you must've taken his permission...
...to entice my son.
Why are you quiet?
What would she say now.
Her entire plan has been ruined now.
Ria.
Your aunt's yelling at Sona.
I was really impressed...
...at how hard this girl's working.
Now I understood what she was up to.
Why are you yelling at her?
We were busy with the wedding.
And she grabbed the
opportunity to entice Ram.
Don't say that, uncle.
Ram likes her too.
- Yes.
That's what her plan is.
Uncle, please...
- Shut up, Ria.
Let us adults handle this.
But...
- Quiet!
If you have any shame
then leave right now.
And find someone else.
See. Didn't I tell you?
She can't stay without me at all.
See. How is she crying.
Your brother's here.
Stop crying like a baby.
Ria. How are you?
Look. I've brought
this wedding sari for you.
Wear this during the nuptial.
You will look really nice.
You must be... Ria's father.
I was rather young when I saw you.
I brought this shawl for you.
Brother!
What's going on?
What happened here, Sona?
See. Both siblings are alike.
We invited you to attend the wedding...
...not to entice rich boys.
What are you saying?
Sister... was flirting
around with a billionaire kid.
And the brother doesn't have a clue.
Hey!
Not a word against my
sister or I will kill you.
If you find out about
your sister's deeds...
...you will beat her black and blue.
Hey!
No, brother. No.
It's your fault, and you
are still fuming at us.
Who are you?
A simple peasant who
works in the fields.
You're not even fit to be our servant.
How dare you try to entice my son?
Get out! Get out of here!
Didn't you hear what she said?
We've seen enough of
your sister's dirty tricks.
Take her away.
Let's go, Sona.
Brother. Please forgive me.
It's my sister's wedding,
so I'm leaving quietly.
Otherwise... Each one of you...
Let's go.
Hurry up, Bijli. Hurry up.
We're losing time.
Not here, load it in that car.
This car?
Where is everyone?
Here they are.
Call me as soon as you reach, dear.
Yes.
I'll say bye to Ram.
- Go on.
But be quick.
- Yes.
I want to say something before I leave.
Listen only to your heart.
You think Sona left you.
She's left her heart behind for you.
Go take a look in her room.
Let's go, dear. You are getting late.
Bye, Ria.
My brother gave this to me.
I love it more than my life.
I never thought I'd lose it someday.
Ram.
Ram.
What are you doing here?
Everyone's waiting for you.
Let's go.
Go on, I'll join you.
We're going back home tomorrow.
You do remember your promise, Don't you?
You're coming with me.
Yes, mom.
The marriage was grand.
But that girl messed things up.
- Forget her.
Look there.
- What?
They look so nice.
Made for each other. Is it not?
What's wrong with you?
Why are you so silent?
Juice?
- Leave!
Why are you thinking about her?
She came and left, just
like a passing cloud.
But I... I am still with you.
Can you wait for me?
- Of course I can.
One year?
- Yes.
Five years?
15 years?
You can't, but Sona can.
You're the passing cloud, not Sona.
""The clouds are thundering.""
""Enraging someone.""
Don't pay heed to him, dear.
He or his father has
no say in their family.
They all listen to his mother.
And she has promised me.
I know what you went through.
Rich people always behave this way.
Brother got humiliated because of me.
Still he didn't say a word to me.
He will get disturb,
looking at you so upset.
Take my advice. Forget everything.
I cannot forget Ram.
What? What are you saying?
Ram didn't catch the flight.
He was with me till Singapore.
But he never got on to
the connecting flight.
He's betrayed me.
What nonsense?
What for?
- Love.
Love?
Oh, my God!
Sona.
Aren't you the Station Master?
And who are you?
How did you come here without a ticket?
I do have a ticket.
Careful, sir.
There was a plate in the way.
Go on. Complete the rituals.
Excuse me, sir.
You're already making me nervous.
I wonder what you will
do after hearing me.
I am Ram.
The same Ram, who is in
love with your sister.
Hi.
Sir. Sir.
Your sister's a really nice girl.
You don't know how long
it took me to woo her.
Sorry.
It wouldn't have
sounded so bad in English.
But what shall I do?
You don't know English.
My family shouldn't have insulted you.
You brought Sona home in rage.
You did the right thing.
I apologize on behalf of my family.
Please Forgive me.
Are you done?
Or do you have anything else to say?
I don't know if I made sense.
But that's what it is.
Come with me.
Raghuveer, why are you taking him inside?
What sir? He wants to
talk to me in private.
Come, sir. Lets go.
He's walking up the death row.
You're completely the opposite
of what I thought you'd be.
You're a complete gentleman.
Wow. Nice house.
Why is it so quiet?
It's the silence before the storm.
Afzal. Pick him up.
And throw him out of the village.
This is your
sister's problem, not yours.
And throwing him out of the village
won't solve anything.
A sister can't express
her feelings to his brother.
She would've told her mother about it,
if she was alive.
I've decided.
Every time I look at her,
I miss my mother.
I can never forget the day...
...when my father humiliated my mother.
She was so heart-broken that she died.
The rich don't value relationships.
I can tolerate whatever
she is going through today.
But I don't want her to face...
...the same consequences as of my mother.
But...
Raghuveer.
He's come here to take his bag.
No, sir. I'm here for Sona.
Raghuveer.
Raghuveer.
Please.
Don't separate Sona and me.
I love her more than you do.
I left my parents, and everything else.
For her.
Tell me,
What shall I do to prove my love?
Tell him to leave.
A person with death
penalty also gets a wish.
Won't you give me one chance?
Didn't you understand what I said?
What's making you so angry?
If your sister
reminds you of your mother.
Then he reminds me of you,
In your childhood.
Even you begged for a chance back then.
Have you forgotten everything?
Without that one chance,
you wouldn't have made it this far.
You can't have different
rules for yourself and others.
Like a fair man,
you should give him a chance.
Sona.
Do you want to choose
your own life partner?
Or I can also have a say in it.
You should also agree on him.
Sir. How do I assure you of my love?
So you can do anything?
- Yes, sir.
You'll have to do farming.
I'll lend you one acre of land.
You'll have to grow
as much of grain as I do.
You will have to wash the cows.
Clean their dung.
Would you be able to do that?
How would he do that.
He will have to.
Leaving the parents is not a big deal.
He'll have to toil in
the fields like a farmer.
The farmer, whom his
mother humiliated the other day.
Only then can he marry my sister.
I am ready sir.
I'll do everything you said.
And grow more crop than you.
What... what are you saying?
Then only he'll realise that
I love Sona more than him.
It's not as easy as
operating a computer.
It's too much of hard work.
Falling in love was easy, Sir.
But I'll work hard to prove my love.
And I'm ready for it.
And if you lose,
you'll forget my sister.
And leave this village forever.
Afzal!
I'll wake you up at 5 in the morning.
Get that?
City bird.
Hi, mate.
New roomie.
I slept pretty late at night.
It was stinking.
Oh! How about some tea?
No. Cappuccino.
There's your Cappachino.
So how was the Cappachino?
Here.
Go clean the stable.
Holy cow! Holy cow!
Excuse me, ma'am.
Dirty fellows.
Hurry up!
You smell, man.
So much work man!
Aren't you done yet?
Oh no!
Greetings holy cow!
Wrong button.
Go. Go.
Where's my tractor?
Tractor?
Stop. Oh my God!
You crazy bulls.
Stop.
Oh my God!
Brother, look at this foreign farmer.
He won't last a day.
He wants a tractor.
Oh mummy...
Here. Eat it.
Colourful.
Water.
Come on. Take it.
Water.
Hey.
Listen.
Catch the early
train tomorrow and leave.
There isn't any need
to tolerate all this.
Will I get the same thing to eat tomorrow?
- Yes.
So are you taking
the morning train back?
Not in your dreams.
I'm putting you on a diet from tomorrow.
Go on.
Come on, baby.
Let's do some farming today.
At first he said, ""We'll discuss the marriage
proposal when my sister returns.""
I guess, now he'll say,
""Let this boy go.""
Why don't you ask?
Whats there to ask.
That boy's toiling hard for his love.
He'll win the bet and Throw
you two out of the league.
Hey.
- Let it be.
Excuse me.
Where does Raghuveer stays?
- And, you are from?
Australia.
Anybody home?
- Who is it?
She's the girl.
So you're the one
who's hooked the gold fish.
I am his father.
What are you staring at?
Go. Call your brother.
Who is it, Sona?
So you're Raghuveer.
Yes.
Do you know who I am?
I am Ram's father.
So you have come here to take him back.
No, I'm here to congratulate you.
Offer you sweets.
How rude.
Is this how you welcome guests?
He's not getting his due respect here
because of you two.
I don't want to be your guest of honour.
Anyways, do you know what it means?
You made my son toil like peasants.
Do you know who he is?
Tell him.
His father is one of the top
500 billionaires of Australia.
So?
Wait and watch,
I'm going to take him away!
So take him away.
Why did you keep him here so long?
We won't spare you.
- Hey!
Mind it.
That day I didn't say a word
because that was your house.
But this is my house.
If you try to raise your voice...
What can you do? What can you do?
Are you threatening us?
We can bribe the police to get you arrested.
- Yes.
You need money for that.
But I can kill you two right now.
You... will kill me?
You will kill me?
Kill me.
Let's see. Kill me.
- Dad.
What have you done to yourself?
Why did you come here, dad?
Ram. He as come all
the way from Australia.
And you're asking him why.
Your condition's making me cry...
Quiet.
Let me talk to my son.
Leave us alone.
What's wrong, Ram?
What are you doing?
You're ruining your future for a girl.
Come. Let's go back to Australia.
Sorry, dad.
Am I not your close friend?
If you were my friend,
you would've helped me.
Well said, Ram.
You?
Why didn't you go with them?
Like only son, like only friend.
Being your father,
can I ask you something?
What if you lose?
How could you ever think that?
First answer my question.
What if you lose?
- What if you fall in the well?
See, I've support. I won't fall.
I've the support of my love.
I won't lose either.
Love's made you crazy.
Did I ever say money's made you crazy?
What a thought!
Did you get that?
- No, I didn't.
That's why I said,
""What was the thought""?
Everyone's acting wise here except me.
Here, eat it.
Stupid. What's he doing?
I don't get it.
You call this life.
God gifted every individual with a fate.
You've everything. So have fun.
Once it's gone,
you'll never get it back.
Does he understand? Is he listening?
I think he's listening.
Bijli. Some people work hard all day
and make loads of money.
And consider themselves fortunate.
But they don't know...
...that the greatest wealth is love.
And by the time they realise that,
it's too late.
Love. Bloody nonsense.
You think this is
the power of your love.
You think I can't do this.
Can't I eat this?
This? You want me to eat this?
Water?
- Water!
Water! Water! Water!
Quickly. Water!
Water! Water!
There's... no water in the car.
Water! Water!
How can you eat this?
It can kill anyone.
You're not used to eating this.
Can you endure anything for your love?
Does love really give
you all this strength?
If it wasn't for love,
I wouldn't have come here.
Neither would've you come for me.
Pardon me. I'm not rich like you.
I'm just a station-master.
It hurts you to see
your son eat this crap.
But she eats this too.
If Ram sleeps on the floor...
...then so does she.
You must be thinking
these are old rustic values.
That's true.
But that's how she is.
And every day she prays in
the temple for his victory.
Don't ever let that
lamp extinguish, dear.
My son's led a life
of luxury and comfort.
He's never done anything all his life.
Seeing him toil here made me go crazy.
Your love has shown me and my son...
...the value of this soil.
God bless you.
God bless you, dear.
Your decision's wrong, brother-in-law.
My sister will never agree.
In fact, it can create problems
between you two.
Yes.
It can make things worse.
I don't want any problem between two of you because of
me.
- Yes.
Don't worry.
I know my wife's weaknesses.
She always listens to useless
and good-for-nothing people.
I'm returning home today.
I know how to make my wife understand.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse me.
I tried my best.
Take a look.
Take a look at my daughter's condition.
What's going to happen to her now?
Stop it, JP. Stop it.
My sister won't agree so easily.
Look. Your only concern is...
...that Ram might marry that girl.
But he'll have to win
the challenge for that.
Yes.
And Raghuveer doesn't want Ram to win.
Ram will definitely lose.
Say that again.
Ram will definitely lose! 100%.
There's crop in everyone's fields.
But, nothing in mine.
Yeah! There's crop in my field too.
Please. Give that back.
Hello.
The situation's getting worse.
That girl won't let go of Ram easily.
I think we'll lose Ram.
I am holding on to your promise
I always keep my promise.
The same will happen this time too.
What do I do now?
No need to tell me what you do.
But she shouldn't
become my daughter-in-law.
You wait and watch now.
They won't know what hit them.
Who are you?
It's me?
- You?
What are you doing here?
- Making a canal.
Canal? Why?
To save the fields from rain.
It won't rain. Just leave.
I think it's going to rain.
You fool.
I've been farming here for years.
And you're going to teach me about rain.
These are just storm clouds.
It's not going to rain...
Afzal!
Don't worry, sir.
I already made a canal in your field.
You're getting drenched.
I'll handle things here.
Raghu!
Raghu! Raghu!
Why are you sleeping here?
What's wrong?
- I was missing mom.
Sir, I was thinking...
- Stop thinking.
I've good news for you.
Sona's scored first class in her exams.
Yes, first class.
Sona.
Take sir's blessings.
Always be successful.
Marry the one you love.
And lead a happy life.
I didn't say that deliberately.
It just came out.
What are you looking at?
I would've gifted Sona the station,
if she was my daughter.
What are you giving her?
Go ahead, Sona.
Ask for anything you want.
Bangles. Earrings.
Go ahead.
Go.
Ask away, Sona. What do you want?
Can we arrange a feast
for the villagers?
Of course, invite everyone.
Brother.
Ram is in the village too.
Can he come?
Fine, Since we're inviting everyone,
invite him too.
He's agreed but only after hesitation.
But careful.
Your brother's coming.
Can I get two more?
Just two?
Someone tie the bull.
He's overeaten.
You're mistaken.
That was me belching, not that bull.
You're mistaken too.
He meant you, not the bull.
- Quiet.
Quiet.
Don't act smart.
And careful...
Thank you.
- What for?
You invited the entire village...
...so I get to eat good food.
The other day I ate that
spicy food and you gave me bonus.
Today, you've excelled in your exams...
...and all I get is food?
No bonus.
Everyone,
on the occasion of Sona's achievement...
...everyone will get a bonus from me.
A box of sweets.
I've realised how much you love Sona.
No one can love her more than you.
Sona.
Sona. Come quickly.
Let go.
Brother!
Let go of me.
Get lost.
Hello.
My name is Rao.
People are terrified of me.
I know.
Who is the target?
He's the right man.
Straight to the point.
Keep this.
I'll tell you the job later.
I'll destroy the entire crop.
Mix it.
Mix it. Mix it.
Boss. This is a new fertilizer.
One litre will turn
the fields lush green.
And two litres
will make it barren like a desert.
Add three.
- Fine, boss.
Look, boss.
- Pour it.
Let's go.
Run. Quickly.
Who is that?
Boss.
- Yes.
I don't know.
Double action.
Same to same.
What's he doing?
What's wrong with you all?
Why is everyone making a ruckus?
Oh, God!
Fire! Fire! Fire!
Brother, fire.
Afzal.
- Brother, fire!
Afzal.
- Yes, brother.
Come to your senses.
Throw water. Quickly!
Come on.
Careful.
Come on.
How did this happen?
Hurry up, Sona.
Hurry up.
Ram!
No, Sona.
No, Sona.
Sona. Stop.
Ram.
- Stop, I...
Are you crazy?
What if something
Would've happened to you?
What?
What's in the box?
Brilliant! You did the right thing.
Destroyed me completely.
What are you thinking now?
Who was that guy in specs,
I saw in the field?
You can keep thinking.
I'll find someone else to do my job.
Your idea to ruin the crops was wrong.
Give me another chance.
If I fail this time you can...
Clobber me with your shoe.
I've a plan.
- You do?
Then it must be good.
Go ahead. Do it.
Sona.
Sona.
The crops will be harvested tomorrow.
That will decide our future.
Are you worried?
I feel something-something too.
In a fit of rage I said
I'll grow more crop than you.
I was a little overconfident, right?
A bit.
Your brother's a nice man.
Ask him not to throw me out if I fail.
I'll work like a peasant.
I cannot leave this village.
The bulls and goats.
The fields.
Your brother's sharp look.
I never imagined this,
but I can't live without these anymore.
This is Ram's pile.
Let's move some of
it in Raghuveer's pile.
Then Ram cannot win.
Boss, you're intelligent like don 2?
Are you buttering me?
Get to work?
Fool.
These bloody mosquitoes...
I forgot to feed the cows again.
Boss, you burnt your
back the other day...
...today, you got peed on your face.
What's happening with you, boss?
Did you finish the job?
Yes, I'm done.
- Was that ajoke?
Get back to work.
You are so dead, Ram.
Why is everyone rushing there,
shouldn't we be in a hurry instead.
Everyone wants the boy to win.
Let's go.
One!
Three!
Five!
What are you doing here?
Praying for your victory?
The offering in Ram's name is done.
Ram?
- Here's the coconut.
I'm really happy.
I don't know whether he wins or not.
But he's definitely won your heart.
- No.
He'll have to win the bet too.
You're still adamant.
If he loses,
won't you get them married?
He won't lose.
He put his life at
stake for my sister's toy.
My mother will never
forgive me if he loses.
I saw his pile in the morning.
It seemed a bit less.
So I added some of
my harvest to his pile.
When you were a kid,
I bet on your honesty.
Today I won.
Break the coconut.
We won, Sona!
We won.
- Rascal. Come on.
How will I face my daughter now?
What will I say to Ram's mom?
Your stupid plan has ruined me.
Now... I'll finish this job.
You handle the police.
Sona!
We won, Sona!
I managed to grow two sacks more!
Two sacks!
Get in! Get in!
Ram!
Ram!
Ram!
Ram!
Brother.
Sona.
Go on.
I proposed for your marriage with my son.
But your brother never replied.
Now... I will get this marriage done.
Come on son.
Tie the nuptial necklace.
We'll see how she won't marry you.
Get lost!
If you marry her.
Her brother will kill you.
He can't.
He can never come here.
- Why not?
I came here, right?
He'll come too.
Look.
Look, he's here.
Sona, run.
Catch her.
Come on, Sona.
This way. Come on.
That way. Go that way.
Sit here.
Don't make a sound.
Stop.
There she is.
Where is she?
Where is she hiding?
Tell me.
- Sir
You dare spit on me!
Stop. Come here.
Leave me!
Faster.
Run over them.
Run over both of them.
Sorry! Sorry!
Brother.
Hold him!
I will...
Brother!
Brother!
Hey!
So, you took the blame on yourself.
Your sister is fortunate
to have a brother like you.
A new dawn awaits you.
Get some sleep.
You're lucky...
to have a sister like Sona.
They didn't get married...
...as there wasn't an auspicious day.
There can't be a better day...
...than the day of your release.
I didn't ask her to come.
Ashwini came here willingly.",42021

The story begins with Fugga, a successful person, giving a talk in London. Fugga recalls his experience of learning from his teacher, Anand Kumar.

The scenes go back in time to show a younger Anand in college. Anand is a lower-class student who has a passion for studies and is good at it. At a local competition felicitation, the local minister, Shriram Singh, proud of him, promises to help whenever needed.

Anand frequently goes to Banaras Hindu University's library to learn mathematics by solving problems in a foreign Math journal. One day, the library supervisor finally catches him and says that he has no right to read there. One staff member suggests he get his article published in this journal and earn a free lifetime subscription to it. Anand goes to the post office, where his father Rajendra works as the head, and posts a letter regarding the solution to a difficult Math problem that no one has been able to solve yet. He then gets featured in the journal for solving the problem and gets a letter from Professor Richard of the University of Cambridge to join a program there.

Anand's family supports him completely, but the family has not enough money for him to travel to England. Anand and Rajendra go to the minister Shriram Singh for help, but he denies any such promise. Anand tries to show his medal as proof and a reminder of Shriram's word of honor, but still does not get the money. They both try to collect money but remain helpless. The same night, Rajendra has a heart attack and passes away while his sons rush him to the hospital. Anand refuses to go to Cambridge due to his father's death and their financial condition.

He then sells papads in the city to add income to the family. One day, he meets Lallan Singh, a [crony\servant] of Shriram Singh, who runs a high-profile coaching center. Lallan takes Anand in as a teacher at his own 'Excellence Coaching Centre'. This helps Anand financially and also earns him praise for his teaching. One fateful day, Anand sees the plight of a boy who had to leave due to poverty. Recalling Rajendra's words, he realizes that these poor kids also have a right to study. Eventually, he leaves the coaching center and starts separate tuition for poor kids in which he enrolls 30 kids at a time. Unfortunately, this hurts him financially and also costs him the support of his love interest, Supriya. But he decides, nonetheless, to teach the kids in an enthusiastic and practical manner by clearing concepts in an easy and fun way. All this enrages Lallan, whose center is facing criticism for not retaining Anand.

Lallan, in an effort to bring back Anand, tries to give free geometry boxes to Anand's center but does not succeed. He challenges Anand to a duel, in which Lallan's students and Anand's students write the same exam, and the coaching center with the lowest average score would be closed. The exam happens; in a ceremony announcing the results of the exam, Anand's students are devastated to know that they lost. To present the papers which Anand signed before the competition, Lallan invites Supriya and her husband Purshottam, an IAS officer, which shocks Anand. However, the papers are not found, which spurs Anand to deny such claims of him signing the papers. It is later revealed that Supriya hid the papers, meaning that she understood Anand's decision to tutor poor kids.

While in course of the tuition, Anand gets immense help from his brother Pranav and his mother Jayanti. Lallan and Shriram plot to have Anand and the students killed so that his kids won't take the Indian Institute of Technology exam (IIT-JEE). Anand is hurt brutally by two of Lallan's henchmen and is hospitalized, on the verge of death. He tells his students to use their knowledge to defeat the goons sent by Shriram, while he is being treated. The students, in unity, use their knowledge of different concepts and subjects and defeat the goons. Anand is treated successfully and recuperates. A few months later the students take the IIT exam and all 30 of them crack it successfully.",4064,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt7485048.srt","And our next delegate
...is someone who has done path-breaking
work in aerospace engineering:...
...Mr Fugga Kumar from India!
You heard that right.
From India.
A third-world nation.
A developing nation...
The source of cheap labour.
Where all those tiresome
call centre workers live.
The 1-800 number tribe. The ones who
say, 'Hello ma'am, how may I help you?
Only think about this: who
is the worldwide head of Pepsico?
Who runs Unilever?
Adobe?
MasterCard?
Vodafone?
Deutsche Bank?
If you don't know maybe
you could Google it?
And when you're at it,
you might want to check who runs Google.
He's also an Indian.
Columbus set out to find
India and discovered America.
After all, every seventh human
being on the planet is an Indian.
Someone would have known.
So we all agree that
Indians invented the zero.
Shortly after that
we forgot how to count.
You must forgive me
for speaking in Hindi.
You'll have to adjust a little.
I've done that all my
life: adjusted to English.
Not that I have anything
against English.
It's a great language.
But to our kind,
it was a huge wall.
English stood between
us and the wealthy.
It's an important asset, this language,
an asset more valuable than money.
My name is Fugga Kumar;
Fugga means 'balloon'.
My father used to sell
balloons on the street.
He's sitting with us today
my father ...
...and my mother!
Once he sold balloons
on the road and now he's
sitting with all of you
influential people...
And all this because of one
man who changed our lives!
This is his story.
This year's Ramunajan Debate Prize goes
to Anand Kumar.
- Well done!
- You've made us proud of you.
And now the Education Minister....
- What did they give you?
- ..will say a few words....
- A foreign journal.
- ...in honour of the...
...great mathematician Ramanujan.
The second prize is a foreign journal?
Hooray!
Hooray!
For poor people, life is road to heaven.
Education is road to hell.
You mean 'road to heaven'.
Say, 'education is the road to heaven'.
I know that.
I was joking.
Do you like my joke, children?
YES!
Then it was a good joke.
Slow-slow increase love.
Slow-slow increase love.
Watch it cross borders!
Meaning: Love grows slowly and...
...then breaks all barriers.
So as I was saying,
Education is the road to heaven.
Study like America, study like England.
Both like to make computer.
Like China, like Japan... Japan like
China and both like to invent things.
But...
India is not like America,
not like China.
India no making computer no inventions.
India makes...
...people, Human calculators!
- What name was that?
- Lallan?
- Not yours, his.
- Anand Kumar.
Look...
Anand Kumar...
He is the calculator of Patna,
Bihar, India.
So friends, if you need any help,
come to my house.
My house is open 24/7.
I give you the keys to my house.
Young Anand, I invite you too.
You need any help...
...emotional, social, economical.
Come to my house...
...24-hour open because
India is not international.
You want India to scrape skies?
Long live Ram Singhji!
Long live Ram Singhji!
Future plans?
Further studies...
... Cambridge, Oxford, PhD in math.
Ishwar wants that too.
Ishwar? God?
My father.
You call your father by his first name?
He's my father and I call
him that out of love.
Really! But all this is
going to take eight or ten years.
True.
I'll lose all my beauty by then.
What beauty?
Oh really?
Some people say I look like
a Bollywood star at some angles.
So do I look at you
only from those angles?
You don't think I look beautiful?
Facts are facts.
Your face lacks the
golden proportion: phi.
- I use ghee every night.
- Not ghee, phi.
The number value for beauty.
Beauty has a value: 1.618.
Beauty has a number?
You didn't get it?
Let me explain.
It's called the golden ratio.
- Look...
- That's my photograph!
Could you focus a little?
The ratio of this section
to this one should be 1.618.
Whatever is beautiful in nature...
...a flower, a butterfly, a conch,
a shell, all of them reveal this ratio.
Isn't that fantastic?
Now look at your face.
The ratio is 1.2.
No phi.
I'm a ratio?
I'm not saying it,
the numbers are showing it.
I'll make your ears ring.
What's wrong?
I hope your math warms you at night.
I'm off.
Don't go.
Stay a while.
- Stay a while.
- I'm off.
Stay a while.
Okay, tell me,
do you love mathematics more or me?
That's what I want to talk about.
Sit down for a moment.
Will you say it today?
Here you are.
I've put my feelings down in a letter.
Read it.
- Okay, I'm off.
- Where are you going?
I'm late already.
- The new math journals will be in at BHU.
- Say 'bye' before you leave!
These are 'feelings'? This is just...
Hey, you, what's your name.
Anand.
Your full name?
You don't look like one of our students.
Outside students are not allowed.
Get out.
Out!
I'm only solving a problem.
Give me five minutes.
That's a foreign journal.
It has a very high standard.
I know it's foreign.
That's why I come every
week from Patna to read it.
Just a few minutes...
Don't bother from now on.
Get out.
Let me finish the problem.
As if you're going to solve it. Out!
Everyone has a right to education, sir.
None of your lip.
You dare argue with me?
Get out.
Are you going to lecture me?
Take this and put it back.
Get along with you.
I've asked his full
name three or four times.
Not a word out of him!
Get him out of here.
Throw him out.
- Never mind.
- Try to get a hold of yourself.
Deep breathing might help.
You might feel better.
Out!
You want to read these journals?
There is a way.
Get an article published in one.
They give you a lifetime subscription.
Got it?
Give me your wallet.
Solved the equation?
Will you take it all?
Mahesh Babu, what's this?
Not had lunch yet?
Now tell me quickly,
how many stamps for 55 grams to London?
London?
Who's posting to London?
See for yourself who's writing.
Hello, son!
What's this letter?
What's in it?
It's a paper I wrote
for a foreign journal.
It's a problem in math
no one has ever solved.
And I did it!
So the white man couldn't
do it and you have?
Now let's try and encourage the lad.
He's hardly going to write
to them that he failed to do it, is he?
It will cost 220 rupees.
I have fifty and another five.
Listen up, folks.
Mr Janardhan?
You too, sir.
I need contributions.
Now give me a good stamp.
If this gets printed,
Bihar will be famous.
Nothing of the kind.
This is how the west
takes our best talent.
They stole all of this
from our religious texts.
And how did they steal
from our religious texts?
How?
Because we didn't understand that
if you spread knowledge, it doubles.
But if you try to control it,
it loses all value.
Here's fifty and five.
The rest will be your contributions.
Here you go.
Spreading knowledge does
nothing for anyone, my friend.
Only the king's son becomes the prince.
That's feudal poppycock.
Times have changed.
Now only he who is fit
to rule will mount the throne.
I'll be back.
There's work to do.
At least, have your lunch.
Mom sent food.
When I get back.
Ishwar.
I have to tell Kaveri
her pension money has come.
- Hello, Uncle.
- How are you?
Hello, Uncle.
Stay blessed, child.
Your son will go far away to study.
All your worries are over.
Your son has got a job.
He's sent sweets for you.
Found yourself a girl?
They say you shouldn't
hold your urges back too long.
When we're close to each other
My heart feels all right.
When we're close to each other
My heart feels all right.
The books don't hold my attention
You fill up my sight.
Meeting you beats mathematics hollow
In these mistakes, I wallow.
I ask no pardon.
Your love has changed
the tectonics of my heart.
I wallow in my mistakes.
I ask no pardon.
Your love has changed
the tectonics of my heart.
Here you go.
Why are you smiling?
What? Me smiling?
I'm not smiling.
No?
I'm not smiling.
Eat then.
Anand
- What?
- She's called you.
Hello?!
Hop on to my cycle,
I promise you the delights
Of several Saturday nights.
Trusting only to God above
And to the power of our love
We'll forget about Monday.
To leave my home to see you
You don't care a bit.
I look for you
What anyone thinks of it
But what does love mean to you?
How do I tell you
In the darkness of my life,
you're the only bright spot.
I wallow in my mistakes.
I ask no pardon.
Your love has changed
the tectonics of my heart.
Brother, forget it.
Jayanti Devi!
What is it?
I think your face has phi in it.
Phi? What does that mean?
Your face sure has it.
Who's getting the good news
this time, Rajendarbabu?
Did you win the lottery?
You're walking on air!
Jayanti, my dear.
- What is it?
- Come here.
What is it?
Where are you?
You'll wake the dead.
Here I am.
I'm here, standing in the sun.
Stay where I can see you.
Come along, move it.
- Coming.
- What's taking you so long?
Do you want the world to hear you?
Good God!
Whatever next! Have you run mad?
Had a peg or two?
Have a care.
The children are around.
Where are the children?
And how did they come into the world.
- We brought them into being, right?
- Shut your face!
What's for lunch?
- What's cooking?
- Let me go. I'll tell you.
Pumpkin
Pumpkin, schmumpkin.
Make us a feast,
baked bread with real butter.
Ask me why?
Okay, why?
Did we get that gas connection?
You got admission to Cambridge.
- Truly?
- How?
Aah!
Anand's article impressed Professor
Richard so much he got you admission
and has invited you there himself.
- Where are you off to?
- Wow!
I have to tell everyone the good news.
And Jyotiprasad's loan has been passed.
You once asked for my full name?
Here it is.
Cut this to fit Anand.
You know...
...in London it's so cold that your pee
turns to ice before it hits the ground.
What rubbish you talk!
This coat has holes in it.
Patch it with my shawl.
What are you doing?
You'll feel cold.
Nonsense. I don't feel the cold.
I'm too hot.
Wah!
You have to stop laughing
if you want me to take a picture,
Sorry, sorry, I won't laugh.
I promise not to smile.
One...two...three!
This is the first
passport in the family.
Come in, come in...This is Anand.
Namaste.
Oh this is the Cambridge
don in the making?
He is.
Very good, very good.
- Proud of you and all that.
- Thank you, sir.
After All...
...people from your society
don't really get that far, do they?
You've got admission, right?
But will you manage to get there?
England isn't next door, you know.
My father paid half by taking
a loan against his provident fund.
Really?
And the Education Minister
said he would help.
He'll cover the rest.
- The Education Minister?
- Yes.
The money?
Anyway...all the best!
Thank you.
Don't mention it.
Hold my hand.
Hurry it up.
We shouldn't miss the boat.
Come along, come on.
You haven't bathed?
Really?
The shampoo is over?
Never mind, never mind.
But you can go into the kitchen,
can't you?
I've not eaten a thing since morning.
Just betel leaf?
My stomach is growling.
Send me a glass of aloe vera juice,
will you?
But it won't give me gas, no?
I'm meeting the Great Unwashed...
Hello, sir.
And how may I help you?
You do remember, sir?
You do remember, sir?
You said you would help?
When you came to my college?
I did invite you, yes, indeed.
I invite anyone who has done
good work for the country.
You did good work and so I invited you.
And today I proclaim...
...that if anyone wishes
to do something for his country.
I will invite him again and again.
Yes indeed.
Sir, sir, you may have forgotten...
...but you said you
would help me with money.
I have got admission...
Money?
Did you say money?
Oh no, no, no-o-o...
Do not start thinking
about money at this age.
What will become of you...?
Is this your father?
Yes.
Greetings, greetings,
but you must explain this to your lad.
Keep him away from money.
He must not fall into
money's honeyed trap.
He must stay away from women and money.
At this time of his life, he must
depend only on the magic of hard work.
Did Bhagat Singh ever think of money?
- Did he?
- No.
No?
I'm not explaining things clearly.
That day you blessed me...
I have got admission abroad.
I want to go abroad, I need your...
- You're going abroad, are you?
- That's right.
Which country?
I've got admission to Cambridge.
- Cambridge?
- Yes.
Very good.
You should go.
Go to Cambridge.
Go to France. Go to Britain.
Go to America.
Go to UK, go to New York,
go to New Jersey, go to Bahrain...
...go to China, go to Japan,
go to Tokyo, go to Beijing....
Wow...I think that's a poem.
But never forget your native land.
Never forget the land where the
Ganga flows... the land where the Buddha...
well, His land anyway.
Very nice. Go away.
Go away.
Happy journey,
happy journey, you can go.
- Happy journey,
- go.
Who's next?
- Sir, I don't think you understand...
- Time's up.
One minute.
Come along, you lot...
Hand those over...
I'm Anand Kumar
I told you, time's up.
Is there a little salt in this?
Yes, yes.
- I told you, time's up.
- Sir.
I'm Anand Kumar..
- You're done here.
- One moment
- You've taken twenty minutes already.
- Didn't you talk to him?
And then there are all these
people who want the minister's help.
Get up now.
The minister has other work.
- I'm trying to...Let me tell him...
- On your feet.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
There are two hundred people
and only two hours...how will we manage?
Make it easy on yourself.
Get up.
Get me some room-temperature water
What's this?
I'll catch my death of cold.
Sir, you promised...
Not cold water, room temperature...
I'll catch cold.
Move on, now.
One minute!
You gave me this medal,
do you remember?
Wonderful, the minister has seen it,
now will you move?
Take this away and get
me room temperature water.
Move along, move along.
Don't worry..
We'll get you to England
You took out all your PF,
didn't you?
No other way we can help.
Rajendra Babu,
why struggle like this?
Let me put in a word and
fix them up in the post office.
I'll speak myself.
I can give you seven thousand.
You have to put something
up as collateral.
Is the house in your name?
If you can't put the house up...
...it's difficult.
Is there no loan
to help educate a child?
No such loan.
And what do we do in the night?
We go to sleep.
And what do we do then?
We dream.
And what do we do in the day?
We make the dreams come true.
Gopal, I really need my money back.
Can you arrange something?
I wish I could.
I spent so much on Bijlee's dowry.
Life doesn't end if you
don't go to Cambridge, does it?
You are my son, after all.
Here, eat this.
- What happened?
- Dad?!
Oh God!
- Oh God!
- Ishwar?
Give him some water.
Ma, stay right here.
Anand, carefully now...
Pranav, bring the cycle.
Coming, coming.
Wait.
Hold on.
Got some money?
Don't worry.
I have some.
Where did they go?
Come on, quick...
Hold on tight.
Take your slippers!
We won't let anything happen to him
Where did they go?
Try to go faster.
Pedal faster!
We're close now,
the hospital is here.
Quick, quick...
- Pranav...
- Faster, faster.
The chain broke!
Ishwar!
You shouldn't think
of a future with me.
Marry someone else.
Forget about me.
Just because my face
lacks the golden mean?
Right?
Poppadums, poppadums!
Poppadums, hello, mister!
Poppadums, poppadums! Coming ma'am.
Buy my poppadums!
Buy my poppadums, crisp and crackly!
Five rupees a packet...
fine spicy poppadums!
- Five rupees
- Come towards me.
- Poppadums?
- How much?
- Show me
- Give them to me.
Sir, my money?
Half a rupee less?
Will do.
Hey Mr Poppadum Man!
Yes, ma'am?
How much for a packet?
Five rupees for a packet.
Give me two.
- Two?
- Yes, please
There you go.
Here you go,
ten rupees, please.
Here you go.
Hello, idiot!
Do you have eyes or
potatoes in your head?
Can't you see such a big car?
If you must kill yourself
Use the good offices of the Ganga.
Anand Kumar?
You're Anand Kumar, aren't you?
What's this, have you bought
up the city's entire supply of papads?
Bought them?
I'm selling them.
Papads?
But how do you know me?
If I would not know the city's
most brilliant mind, who would?
Perhaps you don't know me.
My name is Lallan Singh.
You won the Ramanujan Gold Medal in 1997
I was there.
I won it in 1987.
I'm also a gold medallist.
Srinivasa Ramanujam was
once my hero too.
Then I discovered that
the real hero is elsewhere.
Listen to me.
Before you discover zero
you must discover the
other nine numbers.
Zero achieves its value only
after it joins them.
What is this, a man like
you selling poppadums?
You have talent.
- Come here, you.
- Yes, sir.
- Get over here.
- Coming.
Come this way.
Bring the cycle along.
Give him your cycle.
I am a teacher,
Anand Babu, I can recognise talent.
Come with me.
Take it easy.
Sit back.
Put the glass up.
We shall travel in style,
with air-conditioning!

...my VIP students will
get a VIP entry into IIT.
Anandji, all yours.
- Think carefully.
- I've thought about it deeply, Mishraji.
We'll make Anandji a star...

Hey buddy, make it quick.
We'll celebrate with sweets.
Anandji, our admission rate has doubled.
Sit down...sit down.
Our ads have appeared in the papers.
Here, a full page and here,
a half page.
Look at this.
It is time for you to

This seems old and weak.
It looks weary too.
Brother, look at that one.
Money has come into the room.
Money will dispel the gloom.

How can anyone be so wrong?
Got it?
They've come to pay but
they can't afford the fees.
They were asking
about any scholarship...
No such thing.
On the ground floor, your coaching class
and on the first floor, a restaurant,
a bar and a huge banquet hall.
Patna's elite will celebrate
their weddings there.
The land is available for a song
because it's for educational purposes.
Get it?
What did I tell you?
Education is the road to heaven.
And business is the means
to get on to that road.
And at this time,
education is the best business.
If you've longed to do it, do it now.
What do you care about others?
The road is long
and you can't turn back.
Those who shredded your letters unread
Will now hang on your every word.
They'll look at you with new eyes.
You've left your troubles behind.
And now there's
a smile that you've learned.
This is the illusion of money,
its power.
Money falls around you like rain.
Money has come into the room.
Money will dispel the gloom.
Money will light up the dark.
Money is a walk in the park.
Reading some hot stuff?
No sir.
Mathematics.
Odd.
You have a yen for learning?
Huge.
Which class are you in?
I had to leave school.
Do you understand this stuff?
I solve it too.
Try substituting Log X for T.
Is it done?
Bugger! Drop those books
and come do the dishes.
Coming in just a minute.
They're calling you.
Come fast, you idiot!
I'm there.
In a minute.
Just let me...thank you.
Where to? Can I drop you somewhere?
Thank you, let's go.
Loves studying, does he?
Who? Radhe Mohan?
Sir, he's nuts.
He keeps studying on his own.
I tried to drum some sense
into him: this won't get you anywhere.
Why do you think that way?
What's there to think, sir?
Do you remember the tribal
boy Ekalavya in the Mahabharata?
He was better than Arjun at archery so what
did their teacher Dronacharya ask of him?
What?
He asked for his thumb to be chopped off.
Why?
Just so that Prince Arjun would not
lose his position as the best archer.
Nothing has changed.
The sons of kings will still be kings.
You're talking feudal poppycock!
The world has changed now.
The king's son won't inherit.
He who deserves to
rule will mount the throne.
Who will break this tradition?
Like the Dronacharyas of the Mahabharat,
teachers today partner with kings.
And that's how it will always be.
Isn't it?
We will still demand
the thumbs of our Ekalavyas.
And the princes will still
be considered the smartest.
Who will change things?
By the way. what work do you do?
I had to leave school.
No provisions for such loans...
No provisions for that.
Education is everyone's right.
- Will you study, Master Puppet?
- I will study!
- Will you go to IIT, Master Puppet?
- I will go.
Do you have the money, Master Puppet?
I don't.
Then what will you become,
Master Puppet?
Mister Puppet.
You need sweaty wads of cash,
or your studies will be a car crash.
What is the need to do all this?
Everything is going so well.
For whom?
For us.
The family is...
We're doing well.
The family is...
Anand Sir will coach poor kids...
Free coaching...poor kids
Anand Sir will coach poor
kids...poor kids... Free coaching...
Hear ye, hear ye...
Anand Sir will coach poor kids...
Free coaching...
Admissions have started.
Sir, sir
What is it, Mishra?
Anandji is opening his own centre.
His own centre?
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
Must we have a hostel too?
Feeding them, clothing them, the books,
the electricity, the water bills.
It's perfect.
Take it.
Where is Anand Sir?
We paid premium fees for his class.
Is he coming back or not?
We don't want these
second-rate teachers.
We will demand a refund.
You'll see.
Keep it well.
Why did you quit your job?
How much can I fight my father?
Even when Cambridge didn't work out,
I said you had a future
with the coaching classes.
And where are the kids for
whom you're making this sacrifice?
Where are they?
This is good work,
I agree, but I have to pay the price.
My father wants me
to marry an IAS officer.
Never mind,
I'll spend my life with some stranger.
But I warn you, your life will be ruined
just as much as you have ruined mine.
Here's your stupid love letter.
No one will come
to this centre of yours.
You will drown and you will drown alone.
Put this money away with the rest.
There's lots to be done still.
Master, Master.
Master...
Master, from tomorrow,
Suresh will not come to work.
Why not?
He's going to Patna to study,
to try and get into IIT.
- IIT?
- Yes.
And what will he do
with a degree from IIT?
I want to join NASA; I want
to look for life on other planets.
You?
You've never seen an electric bulb,
You've never watched TV.
You've never seen a city and you
want to look for life on other planets?
Get back to work quietly.
Learn: and you conquer the world.
But learn to know your self.
Learn: and obstacles are defeated.
But learn if those habits are your own.
To learn is to crush all woes.
Do you think you'll reach the
kind of kids you want to reach out to?
All I know is that
there's no turning back.
Learning is your auspicious shield
Learn: for it levels the field.
He who learns will conquer the world.
Learn: for justice comes
flowing from learning.
Learn: it makes you sure of who you are
All human happiness
is tied up with learning.
I don't want anything
less than 30 students.""
We can't pay for thirty.
We can try.
Raghunath Bharat reporting, sir.
You wanted a scoop?
In this day and age when everyone
has made education into a business...
...he's giving it away free?
""I want us to write about him.""
Free tuitions for the poor.
The admissions have started.
Free tuitions for the poor.
The admissions have started.
Sell this as well.
Sell it. Sell it.
What will you do at IIT?
Learn about the theory of relativity.
What is that about?
One way to understand it?
If you travel at the speed of light,
time starts running backwards.
Do you have bus fare?
No.
How do you plan to get there?
The same way man got to the Moon.
Here, here's the money.
Study hard.
Don't worry about me at all.
Hey, hey.
Run, Urmila, run.
Get away from here.
Run.
May I come in, Sir?
You may.
Please take me in your class, Sir.
The class is full.
I'll sit on the side, anywhere.
I was just one mark
behind the thirtieth.
Just one mark?
That's a very important one mark.
It's the difference between
a good try and a victory.
There are hundreds of thousands
who lose by just one mark.
And until you understand
the importance of that one mark...
...you won't stand a
chance at getting into IIT.
So spend this year working
hard and come back next year.
Okay?
Go now.
What is your name?
Keshav.
Kusum from Baksar.
Suresh from Kotiya
- What does your father do?
- He drives a rubbish truck.
He is a labourer in a salt factory.
He drives.
What will you do at IIT?
Biotech Engineering.
Sit down.
Nuclear Scientist.
Sit.
Munger, sir.
That's quite far away.
When did you leave home?
Two days ago.
Have you eaten?
I ate when I left home.
My name is Fugga.
I'm from Baliya.
And that's me, Fugga Kumar.
I wanted to study so badly
that I just ran away from home
and came to Anand Sir's class.
How did you get to Patna?
I stole the neighbour's
hen and sold it and got here.
Sit down.
- How are you?
- Good.
What's in the wallet?
- Nothing.
- Why keep an empty wallet?
For the time when I have
something to put in it.
Sit down.
What's your name?
Kishore.
What were you doing
before you came here?
Worked in a cement factory.
When did you study?
Before the morning
shift and in the night.
And you?
Night watchman.
And then I would study.
How old are you?
Eighteen.
You don't look eighteen.
I eat once every two days.
Give me a chance to catch up.
Right, sit down.
So now, let me see...
Does anyone know the speed of light?
May I, sir?
The same as the speed of darkness.
Lallanji
Hello
Hello, Hello, Anandbabu.
Did I do something to offend you?
You didn't even call.
Hello kids.
I am Lallan Singh,
your teacher's friend.
Look what I've got for you.
Here.
Go on, take one,
So you've started your own Institute.
It's only an attempt.
Good, good, makes for good publicity.
Teaching for free.
If you had told me, I would have opened
it as Social work of Excellence Coaching.
Now don't worry about this lot.
I'll look after them.
You come back where you belong.
No, I'm not coming back.
These kids need me.
I hear your savings are over.
I'll manage.
Don't worry about me.
How can I not worry about you?
I am your well-wisher.
Is this your version
of a social revolution?
This experiment is bound to fail.
With it, you will fail and you will
take all these children down with you.
Never mind.
Let's do one thing.
Return where you belong.
I'll double your salary.
A premium teacher should
not waste his time.
A premium teacher should
teach premium kids.
We'll find a good assistant
teacher to take over this class.
Who says this?
Where is this written?
Raaj purano.
In that story of all stories,
the Mahabharata.
It takes a kingmaker
to train a king.
No one puts lame horses into the Derby.
They stand outside the
railway station and give children
rides for two rupees a throw.
You see?
Then let it be a race.
Let me show you
...that the lame horses
outside the station...
...win the Derby.
I made you.
I will break you.
Go home, Lallanji.
A storm threatens.
And suppose your experiment works
and one or two of these go to IIT?
What will happen to the rest?
Back to the drains and
the dung and the darkness?
Back to the drains and
the dirt and the darkness?
Where are you off to?
At least eat your dinner!
Suresh,
What are you doing?
What's wrong?
Are you scared?
Scared?
Of what are you scared?
Of what are you scared?
What do you have to lose?
Anything?
What do you have to lose?
What do you have?
What do you have to lose?
Then why are you scared?
So you'll be hungry, tired, ill.
What of that?
What will happen?
Will you die?
You were dead the day you
were born in a house of poverty.
That very day.
The rich build a beautiful
road for themselves.
They leave our roads
filled with huge potholes.
But that's the mistake they make.
They teach us how to
leap over those potholes.
When the time comes you'll see...
...the highest jump,
the farthest...
The longest jump will be ours.
- We will jump!
- Learning is your auspicious shield
Learn: for it levels the field.
We will jump!
He who learns will conquer the world.
- We will jump!
- Learn: for justice comes flowing from learning.
Learn: it makes you sure of who you are
- All human happiness is tied up with learning.
- Nuclear scientist.
Marine architect.
You?
NASA.
Who will jump?
Biotech engineer.
Mechanical engineer.
Who will jump?
Who will?
I will sir.
I'll do it, sir.
I will sir.
I will sir.
I will sir.
I will sir.
Learning is your auspicious shield
Learn: for it levels the field.
He who learns will conquer the world.
Learn: for justice comes
flowing from learning.
Learn: it makes you sure of who you are
All human happiness
is tied up with learning.
For two months now,
we've been hearing this.
Anand Sir is coming back,
Anand Sir is coming back.
Give us a date.
When is he expected?
We gave you a million rupees.
We gave you a million-and-
a-half for the additional guarantee.
I assure you, we have some first-
class teachers in Excellence Classes.
Why are you so worried?
It was Anand's name
that brought us here.
Now tell us straight:
When is he coming back?
Bring him back or get
our children into his centre.
We can't get in.
He'll only teach poor children.
And if our children don't get in,
you will end up poor.
We are not the only
parents who think this way.
What are you thinking?
I picked him up off the
road and raised him to the stars.
I put his mug on hoardings.
And now he competes with me!
His payments are pending, right?
Stop them.
Let's see how tough he is.
There Lallanji was preparing for war
And we were preparing
for our examination.
Children, heads up!
We're a little short of books.
We will get more.
Where's everybody?
Anand has come.
Go, go, he's calling you.
Each of you shake everyone's
hand and introduce yourself.
Make it snappy.
You only have ten seconds.
Stop
- Enough.
- Okay, okay.
Was sir saying something?
Now tell me how many
handshakes happened.
30X30
Sir 900.
Wrong.
Sir?
30X29.
One doesn't shake hand with oneself.
Wrong.
Eight months.
We have eight months to the examination
and we have twelve months' work to do.
How will you do it?
From now up to the examination,
you must seek the lessons in everything,
look for the chemistry of life,
ask what physics principles
make the fan turn,
Ask how birds fly?
Ask the lightning why it strikes.
Ask relentlessly.
Ask questions, get the answers.
Then ask questions about
the questions. Eight months.
This is a disease.
Get to the root cause of it.
He's just a teacher.
I'll handle him.
Hello, this is Anand Kumar.
Look, you're a teacher
so I can't use foul language.
Please select a juicy expletive
and assume I spat it at you.
Go on.
I need twenty lakhs.
Send the money.
I don't have it.
If the business doesn't make money,
close it down.
If I don't shut down, what will you do?
Kill me?
I'll have to.
You're ruining the market.
You son-of-a-gun,
how dare you threaten my brother?
I will come to your
house and kill you there.
Why are you getting
so hot and bothered about?
- He's...
- I'm talking to him, aren't I?
Don't get worked up.
Look I'm not going to pay
and I'm not closing the class either.
Now do what you want.
And the nth term is negative 1 by 37268
People ask what was so special
about Anand sir's teaching style.
But teaching wasn't his trade;
magic was.
He would say:
Don't start writing right away.
First let a smile burst inside you.
Then use your head to build a formula
Do you see it?
And here he comes to the run up...
If Shoaib Akhtar bowls
at 143 miles per hour
and the boundary is 63 metre away
how much force must
Tendulkar apply to hit a six?
Think.
The chicken Fugga stole?
Yes, sir?
What if she were
to lay an egg for Fugga.
Do you see it?
No?
And two for Kishore.
And four for Kusum.
And eight for Aazan...
And so on and so on...
...how many eggs would Urmila get?
If a train is travelling
at 120 mph and one by one,
we knock off compartments from it,
at what speed will the engine travel?
When a question vexes you,
When a question perplexes you,
Split hairs if you must
But grind it into the dust.
Without questions,
our lives would be dark.
Like a bulb lighting up,
that's the question mark.
That's the question mark.
That's the question mark.
Clouds float above us at heights where
the temperature is minus 35 degrees.
Why don't clouds freeze?
If you double the radius of this bottle,
how much milk will flow out?
Don't take it for granted
because it's in a book.
The world is waiting
for you to take a new look.
Life gets exciting when
you challenge the given.
...do the Impossible.
When you teach your
teachers a thing or two
When they say you can't
and you show them you do.
When you change their
'why' into a 'why not'?
When your brain lights
up with a lightning spark
And you become a living question mark.
That's the question mark.
That's the question mark.
Tendulkar will have to
whack it with 10,513 Newtons.
The speed of the engine won't change.
Four times as much milk.
53,68,70,912 eggs
Not one of those losers should pass.
Spoil his name.
Go tell it to the newspapers.
File a police complaint.
Do what you want.
Close that centre down.
We'll cut off his electricity.
Go on, do it, Cut those wires.
The electricity has failed.
Anand Sir taught us to see.
He taught us to think.
We looked for solutions everywhere.
We could do anything.
We could become anything.
We could make anything.
We were ready.
But Lallan was willing
to go to any lengths...
Come out, you cad!
Yes, come out, come out.
Don't huddle inside.
This Anand Kumar ruined
the fine flower of my virtue.
He said he would get me into
IIT but nothing happened.
Sitting inside like a cabbage.
Come out.
What happened?
Brother, how can I
tell you my tale of woe?
This Anand has ruined me forever.
- Anand Kumar did these bad things to you.
- Very bad things.
Sister, can you tell me one thing?
What?
What does Anand look like?
This is Anand Kumar himself.
What?
- What?
- That's Anand Kumar, you dingbat!
Every stratagem needs a plan.
It needs revision.
If you don't know that,
how can you make it work?
Next time, plan it well.
Work it out.
Do some revision.
What say?
Cleverclogs Tripathi
- Clever Clogs?
- Tripathi!
knows the score of every World
Cup football match before it starts.
How does he do it?
Because he's clever?
No.
Because he fixes the matches?
Because he's a Tripathi?
The answer must be in his name.
My turn with the book.
Later.
- I need it now.
- Take it later.
Sir said we should share.
Come on, give it to me.
- I'm using it.
- Take it later.
- Give it to me.
- I told you to wait.
I need it now.
- Wait!
Don't...
Now it's torn!
Keep it then.
There are two kinds
of people in the world.
There's Ricky
and there's Bholu.
You'll get only that one.
What?
Six hundred?
So expensive?
Ricky has everything readymade,
served up on a plate.
Bholu has nothing,
only his wits and his willingness to work.
When you've decided on a goal.
You can get out of every hole.
No question will defeat you
No rough ride will unseat you.
When your brain is afire.
Get your basics in order
Get your principles right.
Behind every door, under every bed
Lurks a question mark.
Across the sky, inside my head
Hangs a question mark.
In the river running, on its cool bed
...is a question mark.
We'll work, we'll wrack our brains.
- Sir, any chance of a second-hand copy?
- No chance.
It keeps me from sleeping,
that question mark.
We won't let it get away so easy,
that question mark.
You can run but you can't hide,
Question mark.
You can run but you can't hide,
Question mark.
You can run but you can't hide,
Question mark.
I've got you some books but...
Next question, ten seconds only.
Next question, ten seconds only.
Next question, ten seconds only.
Next question, ten seconds only.
Sir?
Handshakes.
Cleverclogs Tripathi?
He laid great stress on the name.
Listen up, I have it.
You're so stupid.
How Clever Clogs tells the score.
- He tells it with his mouth.
- Go on, eat.
A new solution.
Go on, eat.
Go on, eat.
Anand Sir fought like a tiger
but he lost the battle with hunger.
I know you're doing great work
but there's no way
I can make a loan to you
for a free coaching scheme.
You know it's good work,
you say it's good work
but you can't support good work?
It should show some profit, right?
You don't even have any collateral
so how can the bank
advance you any money?
Just a moment...
Yes, sir?
Of course, sir...In a moment, sir...
But eat something, please.
Go on.
Take them.
The children...
Take them for the children...
His helplessness took Anand Sir
to the one place he never wanted to go.
Anand Babu!
come in.
Come in, come in.
Sit down.
It's very hot.
Shall I turn on the air-conditioning?
How have you been?
That bank manager is my friend.
He was saying you need money.
You should have come to me.
Am I not a well-wisher?
Never mind.
Better late than never.
Let me feed your hungry children.
Take it.
But I know you are not
shameless enough...
...to take alms
To keep your honour intact..
...let me suggest a little competition.
Between your kids and mine.
If they beat my best, I'll feed them.
But if mine beat them,
Then...
...well then you close your centre.
That simple.
What do you say?
What's to think about, Anand Babu?
If your rag-tag bunch can't
take this simple competition,
how are they going to face IIT?
Deal?
Three months of food?
Is that all you want?
Sure.
If Anand Kumar's students lose,
then Anand Kumar...
...will close his centre and
return to Excellence Coaching Classes.
Why are you doing this?
He's sworn on his brother's head.
What if you really have
to shut down the centre?
It's going to close anyway.
I have no money left.
Right then,
if that's what you both wish.
Thanks sir. Thanks.
You have two hours.
That's lots of time.
- Do not hurry.
- But keep it moving.
- Kusum...
- Yes, sir?
If you find yourself at a loss with
a question, give it 15 to 20 seconds
and then move on.
Come on then.
We'll eat well this evening, right?
Anand Sir?
Prithvi, how are you, young fellow?
- Hello sir.
How are you?
- I'm well...
...but why aren't you teaching us?
Is it our fault we were born rich?
Did you eat today?
Yes, of course.
They haven't.
Hey guys this way.
Thanks
Hello.
Good morning sir.
Good morning, good morning.
My name is Purushottam.
I will be your invigilator today.
Raghunath Bharat speaking.
- Mr. Raghunath.
- Yes, speaking.
Who's speaking?
I have some important information for you.
And how do you know this?
This is for them,
let's begin distributing.
Lallan had everything:
The money, the press,
the industrialists...
It was his last chance
to destroy the upstart class.
He was leaving no stone unturned.
Our students work very hard.
But every Evil Empire has its white knight,
waiting to take it down, armed only with the truth.
Note down.
The public has turned out in large numbers
to see the result of the competition.
Perhaps they think the result
might give a new direction to society.
I'll come after the
results are declared.
See you.
Where have you been, sir?
Here, where else?
You don't even print
my picture these days!
Come now, eat some of these,
they're very good, You'll enjoy them.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Namaskar, come, come.
Now we would like to invite
Mr Purushottam to the mike
We can't find Fugga.
He will announce the
results of the competition.
What does that mean?
Please come, sir.
It means, he's missing.
I've looked everywhere.
This is all yours.
And the last of our
money is missing too.
The competition was a tough one.
Both teams seem to have worked hard.
The students of Excellence scored
52 per cent.
Woo-hoo!
Anandji's students scored
49 per cent.
And so I announce that the winners
are the students from Excellence.
Yay!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now,
just as Anandji had agreed,
he must announce
his return to Excellence.
Yay!
And will close...
...his own centre.
Please come.
Remember we signed an agreement.
Go on then.
Anandji has been forced to do this.
There was no such agreement.
How do you know?
One minute, one minute.
If there was such an agreement...
...we want to see it.
To prove there was no undue pressure.
Pressure?
What pressure.
I will show it to you right now.
Hold on, one minute.
Purushottam Sir,
will you please show me that paper?
Things will be sorted out right now.
Why are you shouting?
What is it?
Give us a minute here, we're looking.
Show it to us.
I have no idea where it went.
I had put it right here.
Hello?
Where can it have gone?
I handed it to you right then.
We were together
when I gave it to you.
I can't see it.
Look for it.
When there is no agreement,
what's the fuss?
Then it's Anandji's decision
to close or not to close.
Why are you getting so excited?
You shut your gob.
You eat my snacks and drink
my tea and then insult me?
You can't threaten the media.
I am not a lackey of corporate
interests like the rest.
My name is Raghunath Bharat.
Take note.
Noted, noted.
Now be silent.
Anandji, you tell them.
Tell them you signed an agreement.
I signed nothing.
My centre continues.
What are you saying?
What do you mean?
This is cheating?
And what destiny has
done to these children?
If that's not cheating,
what is it?
A blessing?
You swore on your brother's head.
He will die, if you break your word.
I have no intention of
dying any time soon, Lallanbabu.
We have been shoved so far back...
...that even the God of Death
would take his time to get to us.
Thank you.
I stole that paper.
I know.
It is very difficult to put
something above your self-respect.
Anand Babu knows that his
duty comes before anything else.
You loved a good man.
I have good taste in men.
Why couldn't you crack the paper?
Was it tough?
No, sir.
Not that tough.
We knew most of it.
Do you lot want to go to IIT or not?
We do, sir.
Close your eyes.
Can you see yourself in the world of IIT?
Can you see it?
We can, sir.
What do you see?
Sir, it's big, imposing.
The rooms are air-conditioned,
the classrooms are big.
What else do you see?
It's so clean, so neat.
The kids are all wearing
expensive clothes, jeans, jackets.
Their hair is silky with shampoo.
They laugh at our oily hair.
They're all talking English, fluently.
And we can't keep up.
Want some?
It's good for your brain.
Take it.
We don't have the guts to talk to them.
Our brains are jamming up.
Hello. Excuse me.
No, this is my seat.
You will have to get up from here.
You sit here,
I'll go somewhere else.
No, you sit down.
Sit down.
That day we were taking the exam with
kids whose houses we would have cleaned.
whose shoes we would have polished,
whose dustbins we would have emptied.
Sitting next to them
our brains just stopped.
Maybe that's why Fugga ran away, sir.
He was frightened.
He must have thought
we'll never catch up.
We can't compete.
There's no place for us in
this English-speaking world, sir.
Have you seen a film?
Any of you?
- No, sir.
- Anything?
Jai Santoshi Maa, sir.
- And?
- Sholay.
Right.
Then tomorrow, no studies.
It's Holi and at 11 am, you will go to
Gandhi Chowk, outside Excellence, and in
front of everyone, you will present a play.
And all of it...
In English.
Not a single word of Hindi.
If anyone says a single word in Hindi,
back to the village you go.
Twenty minutes.
Not a word in Hindi
Remember: tomorrow, 11am,
Gandhi Chowk, only English.
Twenty minutes.
And until the play has ended,
no one leaves the stage.
Why do you want to strip
them in front of the world?
If I don't strip them, they won't learn.
And that thirty-first student?
What was his name?
Ajju.
Go find him.
I want thirty students, a full thirty.
Go find him.
And how do we feed them?
I don't know.
One word in Hindi...
...and it was back to the village.
Hello...

Hey, what happened to the English?
English Holi, Happy Holi, yaar.
I won't speak English
Not to my father-in-law.
My heart is Bihari and so is my tongue
And my heart is my law.
He told me you told him
I told you no tell her
I told her no tell you
I told you no tell her
I told you she tell me
He told her to tell you
So tell me to tell you
She told him to tell her
—That's English for you.
The way of the world
is odd in the extreme.
No one cares about your dreams.
If you're speaking English,
that's enough.
So what if your English is rough?
You throw stones, we reply with rocks.
You throw stones, we reply with rocks.

Or are you only listening
to how I'm saying it?
The road to Ramgad is a minefield.
Tell your father-in-law to be careful.
No police station, no facilities.
Not even a greasy spoon café.
We chase bandits on horseback.
We flash knives and gun racks.
Basanti sweats up a storm.
The dacoits chew on a plug.
You throw stones, we reply with rocks.

-I'll write about you.
We had fought English and won...
...but the fight to conquer
hunger was still to be won.
If Anand Sir could solve
any mathematical problem...
You lookin' at me, kid?
...he could also confuse
any mathematical issue.
Are you Ghantewala?
No, no.
That was my father.
I am Ghantewala Junior.
This shop is going to close down.
Are you nuts?
I employ eighty people here.
In three years,
four months and twenty-one days,
this shop is going to close down.
You an astrologer or something?
A mathematician.
I hate seeing someone
else's calculations go wrong.
Since you seem like a good man,
I thought I should explain it to you.
Let us say about 1500
people eat here every day.
If each spends fifty per head,
that's Rs 75,000 per day.
That's your income every day.
In a month that's two
million fifty thousand.
Right?
Fifty into fifteen hundred means
four hundred and fifty thousand.
But there are problems.
Your clients are abandoning you.
The A/C restaurant
that's opened next door?
Twenty per cent means 300 people.
Have you considered depreciation?
At 13 per cent. Now adjust for
inflation Raw material costs
Over 30 days,
how much does this become?
Four hundred and fifty thousand.
How much was your profit?
Nothing.
In mathematics, we call that zero.
Anand Sir caught him
in a maelstrom of numbers
From which only he
could free poor Ghantewala.
That's the way of it.
Things change...
...in a flash.
I told you all this
because you're a nice man.
See you around.
Hold on, hold on.
You diagnosed the disease.
Is there a cure?
Anand Sir had a cure.
Of course he did.
There is.
But it will cost.
You will have to give me rations
for thirty people for three months.
But first today's lunch.
Done.
Sit down, please explain.
Why didn't you do this earlier?
Maybe they're right.
Don't they say: Necessity
is the mother of invention?
But storm clouds...
...were beginning to darken the sky.
Are you fine
- Didn't you bring the lady wife?
- Madam will come later, she is a little busy
Okay. Okay
Take this.
May you live a long and happy life.
Happy birthday, Sir.
Sir?
You were a teacher.
What did I make you?
CEO, sir.
Not a CEO.
I made you part of the coaching mafia.
And did I do that so you could ruin me?
Here I am trying to restore Bihar's lost glory,
bring back the splendour of ancient Nalanda.
I've invested billions so that
education can be a path to progress.
I've opened dozens of classes
all over the UP-Bihar belt.
We have a joint venture in Gujarat,
investors are coming...
and what do we have here?
Bring those newspapers.
Bring them here.
Here you are, sir
Don't stand behind me, all hangdog.
Come face me like a man.
What is this?
What is this?
In Hindi.
And here...
in English.
Everyone's talking about Anand Kumar.
Do you know what this means?
People will start asking why they have
to pay for what he's giving away free.
And they'll say we're
looting the people.
We're dacoits.
And what will the investors say?
Yes, sir.
Sir, I tried.
I cut his electricity off.
I sent a woman to defame him.
I sent him a death threat.
And we had a competition
OUT!
A kiddie game?
I cut off his electricity?
I sent a girl to defame him...
I want no risks.
Not one of his students will
sit for the exam, do you get that?
Got it?
Got it, sir.
No, you haven't.
I won't believe you until
you say it three times.
Go on then.
Repeat it for me.
I understand, sir.
I understand.
You're in the big league now, Lallan.
You're dealing with the big boys.
These fancy suits you wear?
I'll strip you naked.
Don't show your face at the party.
Get out.
Hey you!
Where does that teacher live?
Hello, buddy, where's the teacher?
Down that lane?
Masterji...
Masterji, Masterji.
Hey, Raghunathji.
Why is he getting into this mess?
You're teaching, stick with that.
How are you?
Never mind how I am.
They've put out
a contract on your head.
What?
They've put out
a contract on your head.
Listen to him.
I am a professional,
a thorough professional, you get it?
But I will not kill you.
Do you know why?
When I was in jail...
...your father made up a story about me
working in the city
and kept my mother happy.
Those fake letters let her live.
Those letters kept my mother happy.
Which is why
I'm here
to warn you.
Nevertheless, it will happen very soon.
Be careful.
I have a request to make
Go on then.
If something happens to me,
don't write about it.
Why?
Many people are trying
to bring about change.
They might lose their courage.
I'll be seeing you.
Look, Pranavji,
if death is written in Anandji's fate,
a hundred policemen
won't be able to stop it.
And if it isn't written in his fate,
an atom bomb won't be able to harm him.
I didn't come here for
a lecture in philosophy.
I came to ask for police protection.
This is not philosophy, sir.
But try to understand my plight.
Our workload is huge.
And I have only 41 constables.
Many are on duty to protect ministers.
Five are outside the
temple after that incident.
Twelve are left.
Of which two are heart patients
so they can't be given strenuous duties.
Three have diabetes so they
can't be given stressful work.
And one of them has a pregnant wife.
He's gone for the delivery.
You tell me how I can spare someone.
Where's Pranav now?
The children's food is ready.
You'll have to take it there.
There was a letter.
Hold on a moment.
Greetings, Anand Sir.
You dropped your towel.
- Look at me.
- Pick up your tiffin carrier.
Let me help.
I seem to have dropped everything.
Let me get this.
Thank you so much.
No need for thanks.
This was only our duty...
Is that any place to shoot him?
You should have shot him in the head.
This darned thing is stuck.
It won't budge.
What do you mean stuck?
Tell you what,
shall we crush his head with a stone?
Are you nuts?
Pick him up and let
the train do the work.
Is he dead?
Did you kill him or not?
The minister is on the phone.
We shot him.
That's all we know.
That's all you know?
You shot him and you
can't tell me he's dead.
Sir, there was some confusion.
They're saying they don't
know if he's dead or alive.
Idiots!
We did our best.
Sir, we shot him in the stomach
and then dragged him on to
the tracks for a train to finish off.
He would have died but then
his brother came on the scene.
Shut up.
Shut the muck up.
If he survives,
he becomes a hero, a media hero.
Should we go kill
him in the hospital then?
We'll barge in and finish him off.
Oh right, kill him in front of
everyone and make a martyr out of him.
Listen.
Take a whole bunch
and go out there...
...and make it seem
like a Naxalite attack.
No one should survive.
Kill Anand and
his students, in the hospital.
If even one of them sits
for it and gets into IIT...
Anand becomes a hero.
Before the exam, I want all this over.
Now go.
Everything is over
Get on with it.
Let's go.
Doctor, Doctor,
my brother, he's been shot.
Please, take a look at him.
I beg of you, please, he's bleeding,
We'll pay anything.
Get away with you.
Fill out this form.
Please admit him first.
This is Anand Kumar.
He teaches poor children free.
- Please do something
- You're going to teach me?
Do your work.
Now these people are going to teach us.
Open your eyes, son.
Pranav, please hurry.
Yes, yes, Ma.
I'm bringing the doctor right away.
- Hurry!
- Coming.
I'll hit you so hard,
You'll become an ENT
specialist in a minute.
Hey!
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- Shut up.
No, no, don't be like that.
- I'll fill the form.
- Don't worry. Ignore him.
He got his seat in medical
college with a donation.
He knows nothing.
You don't worry about a thing.
Anand Sir is like a God to us.
Hey Raju, get over here.
Check his vitals.
Get his blood group.
Organise donors.
And get Dr Jha to come here.
I am filling the form.
Don't worry about a thing.
We won't let anything happen to him.
Here.
Get this.
Tonight, they're going to come.
In large numbers.
With guns and weapons.
They want to kill you.
Oh God!
and they want to kill the students too.
Why did you run away?
I funked it, sir.
I thought we would never
be able to compete with Excellence.
Are you happy?
No, no.
At least...
...educate your children well.
Quick, now.
Nothing is going to happen to you.
Move, move, move.
One minute
What is it?
Hey, kids, Anand Sir wants a word.
This is the time.
The time to make the leap.
You've immersed yourself in theory;
time for practicals.
Time to turn knowledge into action...
Learn: and you conquer the world.
- ...the time to fight.
- But learn to know your self.
Learn: and obstacles are defeated.
But learn if those habits are your own.
To learn is to defeat all foes
To learn is to crush all woes.
There are two kinds
of people in the world:
One is Ricky.
and Bholu.
They'll come with more confidence
And less ammunition.
They must be sure we're sitting ducks.
I agree. For a half-dead teacher
and some students?
How much would they think they need?
We need to exhaust their bullets.
Without hurting them
Why?
Or what difference between them and us?
They brought two guns and a knife.
Not even too many bullets.
First we make sure
they run out of bullets
and then we lure them into
a gas chamber and lock them in.
Listen, the hospital is
going to be attacked by Naxals.
Get everyone into one room.
What?
Are there rocks in your ears?
MTurn off all the lights.
Get on with it.
We'll take care of the rest.
We have nothing, they have it all.
How can we compete?
Today, it isn't the
prince who mounts the throne
but the man who proves his worth.
The hospital seems deserted today.
Learn: and you conquer the world.
But learn to know your self.
Learn: and obstacles are defeated.
Learn: and you conquer the world.
But learn to know your self.
Learn: and obstacles are defeated.
But learn if those habits are your own.
To learn is to defeat all foes
- The tyre is heading towards the petrol.
- To learn is to crush all woes.
Learning is your auspicious shield
Learn: for it levels the field.
He who learns will conquer the world.
Learn: for justice comes
flowing from learning.
Learn: it makes you sure of who you are
Radhe, Radhe...
The sound is coming from there.
Radhe, Radhe...
Where is the sound coming from?
Now look there.
This is the law of reflection.
That means the sound may
not be originating from the
place where it seems to be coming from.
If the angle of incidence
is equal to the angle of reflection...
Radhe, Radhe...
Radhe...
Learn: and you conquer the world.
- No one here.
- But learn to know your self.
Learn: and obstacles are defeated.
- They're over there.
- But learn if those habits are your own.
- No, no, over there.
- To learn is to defeat all foes
To learn is to crush all woes.
Keep some bullets for later.
You might need them.
Locks on both sides.
Are they outside or inside?
Step away.
Be very quiet.
Easy.
Where are those kids hiding?
There's something spooky
about this hospital.
The sound seems to be coming
from there; that's where they are.
Hold on.
They're fooling us.
When light moves
from one lens to another
The object in between can vanish.
Means what is between can disappear
Learn: and you conquer the world.
But learn to know your self.
Don't be in a hurry
to pick up your pens.
First smile, close your eyes., and you will
find a solution. build a formula in your head.
- Hey, let me go.
- To learn is to crush all woes.
Sorry, let's go.
What's going on?
Where are we?
What's this
Are you going to kill one of your own?
Open the window.
Cleverclogs Tripathi knows the
score of every match before it starts
because the score before
a match starts is always the same:
zero - zero.
- Liked it?
- YES SIR!
You got distracted
from the real problem.
Where was the problem?
Here.
Where were you looking?
There.
This is called a distraction.
- What is it?
- Distraction!
Got it?
Hey, there are more coming.
Let them come.
How does the eagle catch the mouse?
She does not swoop on
Point A where the mouse is
She changes her angle to
the Point B where the mouse will be.
42 degrees.
What's that?
That night we used all that
we knew to fight what we had to face.
But not a thing came near Anand Sir.
After a night of fighting,
we went and slept in front
of the examination centres.
All thirty sat;
I gave the exam the next year.
And the question still was:
how many of those thirty
were going to make it to IIT?
How many were going back to
the dirt and the dung and the darkness?
This was the moment of Bihar's destiny
To see if the old tradition would hold...
...Or if those who were truly
capable were going to mount the throne.
Now close your eyes...
...and take thought for your parents.
Where is the money?
I have nothing.
Where is the money?
- Where is the money?
- There's nothing left.
You've taken it all.
Urmila, Urmila, you're in.
It happened.
What?
They did it.
All thirty.
All thirty.
All thirty of them into IIT?
Anand?
You can make it
Your destiny...
Is for you to make...
Be who you strive to be
Be the Pauper or the Prince.

The new world order...
The new world order...
The new world order...
Let this be the new order of the world
The new world order...
The new world order...

Anand Sir always said
creating
geniuses thirty at a time
but he was changing
lives, thousands at a time.
Because when a child studies
then the whole family gets a chance,
everything changes
and every generation
that follows can go further.
Forever.

The world's on your ally.

Help your dreams break free.
Nature has...
...given everyone this opportunity...
To earn your right

Masaan tracks the lives of two young people in Varanasi, India.

Devi Pathak (Richa Chadda), a trainer at a coaching computer center and her student, Piyush Aggarwal, are caught having sex in a hotel room by policemen who had been tipped off by the hotel staff. Inspector Mishra records the barely clad Devi on his mobile phone. Piyush locks himself in the bathroom and commits suicide by slitting his wrists. Inspector Mishra threatens to book Devi for abetting Piyush's suicide and demands a bribe of INR 300,000 from Devi's father Vidyadhar Pathak, a Sanskrit professor who now runs a book shop with an income of about Rs 10000 per month. Pathak is tempted by a betting game, where people bet on small boys to dive and collect the maximum number of coins from the Ganges riverbed within a specified time. He had previously barred Jhonta, a boy who works at his shop, from participating in the diving game but relents after Mishra's threats increase. Devi cycles through jobs at different coaching centers, facing harassment by colleagues as the news of her affair spreads. She eventually gets a temporary government job in Indian Railways, but tells her father she wishes to leave Varanasi to study at Allahabad University as soon as Mishra's bribe is paid in full.

Deepak Kumar (Vicky Kaushal) is the youngest of a Dom family working in the cremation ghats. He is a civil engineering student at a polytechnic college. Deepak's father doesn't want to see his sons continue the hereditary job. Deepak falls in love with Shaalu Gupta (Shweta Tripathi), a high caste Hindu girl. They start meeting each other and during a trip to Allahabad on the banks of the Ganges, they share an intimate moment. Back in Varanasi, Deepak tells her about his caste and the work he does burning corpses. Shaalu doesn't mind and says that she is ready to run away with him if her parents refuse. She asks him to focus on his exams and getting a good job.

On a pilgrimage trip with her family, Shaalu dies in a bus accident. Her body with those of other victims ends up at the same cremation ground where Deepak's family works. Deepak is devastated on seeing her dead body. He eventually overcomes his grief and is hired by Indian Railways as an engineer in Allahabad.

In a special diving competition, Pathak bets Rs 10000, a significant portion of his remaining savings, on Jhonta. Jhonta drowns and is taken to a hospital by Vidyadhar, who vows to never let the boy participate in the diving competition again. As Jhonta regains consciousness, he is shown to have found Shaalu's ring, which had been thrown into the Ganga by Deepak in a fit of grief. Jhonta gives it to Vidyadhar, who sells the ring to fully pay off Inspector Mishra.

Before leaving Varanasi, Devi visits Piyush's family, where his father shouts at and slaps her away. She comes to the banks of the Ganges to immerse the gift Piyush had given her on that fateful day in the hotel. Deepak, who is by the bank, notices her crying and offers her water to drink. A boatman beckons, offering both of them a ride towards Sangam. They both board the boat and strike up a conversation.",3138,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt4635372.srt","Official YIFY movies site:

Kill that damn door!
Open!
What the hell is he doing?
Open the door !
Are you standing idly by?
Break down the door!
Holy shit!
Sir!
Come to see !
What now?
Pandey! An ambulance !
- Piyush ...
- Quickly !
Slowly.
Be careful, he's bleeding a lot.
Get her dressed, we'll take her on board.
What are you watching?
THE PYRE
My son, are you back home?
I'll bring you a glass of water.
Do not bother,
I will help myself.
I give you some.
Mother, we must light the stove.
Go find the sacred fire of the ghât.
Also wake up Sikandar.
He has to go to work.
Bro
Bro...
Sikandar ...
Hey, brother!
Mom sends me to wake you up.
Standing !
<i> Ram, the name of God
is the eternal truth ... </i>
- I bring fire to mom, I come back.
- What about Sikandar?
He's up, he's coming.
Hey, Motilal!
- Join us.
- I can't leave my shop.
Your shop! We won't steal anything from you!
They brought us this,
they are from the university. Tell him.
Sir, we have
an anthropological project.
They want history and tradition
of our ghats. Enlighten them.
You are the scholar of our ghats!
And you, the one in our alleys!
Shady alleys at night, eh?
You save?
Yes, we forget details
taking notes.
The story...
Formerly, on the banks of the Ganges,
our mother,
stretched the jungle.
The ritual of the pyres was born
on the sacred Ganges.
Many kings
established their ghât here.
Priests from all provinces
settled there.
Each ghât
is allocated according to the regions,
castes and priests.
You see ?
The ghât where we are sitting
is controversial.
- Like Kashmir.
- Yes.
People of Maharashtra
claim it.
Like those of Gudjerat,
What are we going to do with him?
Here is Jhonta, the hero of the ghats,
who wants to become president.
But to bring me customers,
no need to rely on him.
- So what?
- I was going to do it!
Bring my phone. Hurry up !
The neighboring ghât is that of Scindia.
I am going to look for clients.
Kids today are in a hurry.
They don't stop.
The phone doesn't stop either.
Calvary of modern times!
It's me.
They are ingenious.
Madame has put herself in suri
and made herself beautiful.
They hardly know each other,
and forward!
Why?
What did you tell us?
Repeat it.
Explain to your father.
What are you saying
""Out of curiosity"".
If I tell a journalist about it go will make the headlines.
What's this ?
A file for another service?
What does it mean?
Are you not paying attention?
Get out !
Can you tell me your name again?
Pathak.
Vidhyadhar Pathak.
I give rituals
at the Nandeshwar ghât.
I used to teach Sanskrit
at University.
I also translate books.
We'll call you back in three days.
For now, pay the deposit,
and take your daughter.
Mr. Mishra ...
What does ""for now"" mean?
If the boy dies, she is an accomplice
of a suicide, of a crime.
Court
media, you will have to face it all.
Don't beg me! Pay the deposit.
Consider that we are alike ...
Pay the deposit and get out!
Centrifugal force was used,
centripetal force.
And we find ourselves stuck.
So we explore upwards.
And here we are
in the world of civil engineering.
Questions?
How many months of study do you have left?
Two more months, dad.
Then the exams, and the internship.
- The what?
- The internship, for a job.
Do we have to pay to get hired?
Not anymore, mom.
Railways and electricity
hire by competition.
You should not
monitor ash filtering?
What if the kids steal the money?
Uncle Shambhu is there.
Shambhu is still high.
So what ! I have the right to eat?
How much will you earn?
I will find out after my interview.
It's good. Leave here.
The earliest would be best.
Otherwise even you will end your life
among the burning bodies.
A wafer !
I found that, is it in silver?
Hello Master !
I took my bath early!
Weren't you there for 3 days?
Shut up and do your job.
Is your father here?
He is on the ghât.
Call him.
The boy is dead.
Did you offer her some tea?
Sit down.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Mr. Pathak, the boy is dead.
The body is autopsied,
the report will not delay.
Here are the court papers.
Please fill them out.
Wait...
How does the tribunal affect us?
It is a complicity in suicide.
But, sir ... the boy ...
He killed himself in front of your eyes.
Under your intimidation.
Are you lecturing me, professor?
Listen carefully...
Save your sermons for
your client wankers on the ghats.
Including?
Haven't you seen it on TV?
R.K. Puram's sex scandals,
and Jammu and Kashmir.
Now your daughter is part
of a beautiful sex scandal.
Sir, tell us how to do it.
What is your monthly income?
I earn 8-10,000 rupees.
She works too?
Yes, in computer science.
I'll get right to the point.
Complicity,
media, court,
I can take care of everything.
But you have to work it out.
300,000 rupees in 3 installments.
I'll leave you 3 months.
No, you are wrong.
We have principles.
And we wouldn't even have 50,000.
From now on...
Never again...
Never negotiate with me again!
I come to sell a bar of soap
I am here to save your honor.
I have the video of the sex scandal
of your daughter.
Just put it on the Internet,
then no one in Benares
won't let go of your daughter!
Find 100,000 within 2 days.
Don't nod your head
like a horse!
You are going to do what?
Find 100,000 in 2 days.
And in 2 months?
200,000.
Easy to understand, right?
Where are you going?
- At the cremation ghât.
- It's forbidden for women.
You have to hit the skull 5 times.
Piyush!
Deepak, go help him!
Piyush, my son.
The skull must burst
for the soul to escape.
That's 26 rupees.
Where do they come from?
I dived while holding back
my breath very long!
So what?
Let me participate!
Are you asking me to let you bet?
It's not a bet, it's sport.
And I am a pro!
So shut up.
Don't you have a job to do?
You got fucked
by a bull, or what?
It's Pooja with my teddy bear.
Cute, eh?
You can ask him
the name of this girl?
How do I do it?
""Pooja, my mate is crazy
from your girlfriend
""who goes to your poetry reading.
""Tell him his name so that he invites him.""
Shall we send a request?
Deepak is quite exhilarated.
As they say ...
All night long the mango was shaken,
but when the time came she fell.
What's the matter with you?
Good listening.
You remember her?
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Be serious.
Girls' college B.N. Roi.
She must be there.
Will you find it in Pooja's album?
Yes she must be
in his friend list.
It's her?
There it is!
Shaalu Gupta.
Gupta, the class!
Cool, man!
Open a Facebook account,
and let the fireworks begin!
You understand?
Send him a request.
We did it?
Yes.
Come closer, everyone!
Earn lots of money, and fast!
In a few minutes, 10 rupees
bring in 50! And 50 is 200!
These young people will dive
to bring back coins.
Bet on the one who will bring back
the most coins!
20 on Loku, it is noted.
Do not hesitate ! Place your bets!
20 rupees on Netwa.
Let the competition begin!
... 2 ...
Go!
Let's see who brings back the most coins!
Gentlemen, take a good look!
Loku brought back 3 coins.
Netwa! Faster !
Babua only brought back one piece.
Munna had 3 coins at once.
Hold your breath!
- Boss, let me go!
- No, you're watching.
Please I want to go!
What an exciting competition!
Did you bet well?
Those who bet on Munna
see their earnings triple!
Sikandar!
Throw your leg in the stake, asshole!
Sikandar!
Looks like the old man is drunk.
A glass,
king of the Dom community!
Another for you prosperity!
Do I look like a king?
Let's see! There are only two kings
in Benares.
One is Kushi Nuresh,
the other the king of the Dom.
One on the other side,
the other on this side.
Look at poor Shambhu.
How many bonus days per year?
Hey ! Shambhu!
Yes sir !
One every ten years.
Shambhu has a bonus day
once every ten years.
So...
That day...
all cremation earnings
comes back to him.
Shambhu's father
was touching his bonus day
once a year.
He was fulfilled and he had ten children.
The bonus has been shared.
His dad had a bonus day
per year,
Shambhu inherited
of the tenth of the bonus.
Today, Shambhu touches
a bonus every ten years.
When will your next one, Shambhu?
I have no more!
I sold my bonus rights to Lulu.
He paid me 100,000 rupees.
I will live on alms the rest of my life.
If I sell my bonus,
I will have a million rupees.
Isn't that right, Lulu?
As if you were going to sell them to me!
Should we sell?
Are you asking your son for advice?
Our ghât does not concern him!
The educated man is an asshole!
Are you insulting my son?
I will never sell you my bonus!
But you never thought about it!
Dad,
I need money
for the Durga Puja party.
Take in my shirt.
300 rupees, will it be okay?
Take what you want.
You are my Everything.
Will you finally explain yourself?
What do you want to hear?
I want to know.
Who was he ? What happened?
I saw him at the computer center.
I was typing his study report.
We became friends, that's it.
And that's all?
Yes.
I liked talking to him.
You didn't think twice
before doing it?
Not even once?
Huh?
Answer!
What?
- You heard?
- I do not know!
A boy has just died.
We have a ransom of 300,000 on our back.
I liquidated my savings of 100,000.
You're on the verge of going to jail.
And you answer:""I don't know.""
Friend request sent
You come to the Durga Puja party,

That's 20 rupees.
Put this watch in the hat.
Slowly ! Yes, in the hat.
The watch is in the hat.
Now blow into the hat.

The watch is gone!
The watch will reappear

You first.
Well...
We're friends, aren't we?

say it to me.

Piyush Agarwal,
born in Allahabad.
He is dead.
A tragic death.
I heard it say.
I am from the center where he was in training.
These documents were his.
And he owed money.
He also had books to return ...
Could I have his address?
Get out! The contest is over!
four hundred ninety seven
Who has the most coins?
Hey, Munna!
Tell us who is the winner!
Jhonta!
- I told you I would win!
- You were wonderful.
Father of Piyush:Ramdhari Agarwal
Hide these stars in my eyes
May they be safe there
<i> the night will be long to last </i>
travelers like the two of us
Will cross on a path
Maybe in the sailor's light
Then?
Then?
How? 'Or' What? That's all.
Sorry,
I am not there.
What I understood is very beautiful!
You are stupid !
And adorable.
What? What?
I said nothing.
But I heard!
You will faint
if I read Chakbast.
Is it going to be your birthday?
I saw it on Facebook.
Is that so?
Facebook doesn't say it all.
What?
A picnic.
Shaalu?
My mother asks me. I will call back.
By the way !
Yes.
You must call me by my first name
and be familiar with each other.
If you remember two poems.
I'll decide after. I have to go.
Hello?
Goodbye.
A poem by Dushyant Kumar.
You are like the train at the misty dawn
I shook like a shaken bridge
In the immense forest of your eyes
Little by little my way is lost
Yes is on the device?
May I speak <i> to </i> Mr. Ramdhari Agarwal?
It's me. Yes are you?
I ... I ...
What do you want ?
This is the Kashi Cooperative Bank.
Our new products ...
I don't want anything, thank you!
I'm telling you bluntly.
I want fucker.
Okay?
No one will know.
He was fucking you too.
It's good quality, look.
- It's way too expensive.
- But no !
I'll give you a discount. 320 rupees.
Leave. You think
and come back to buy it.
Okay?
I resigned.
Hey, Pathak!
Your daughter did not come
since a long time.
Hello.
Go away.
What?
Do you want me to die of shame?
Go away !
Indian Railways Recruitment
- What's going through your mind?
- Nothing.
""Nothing"", ""I am not"",
That's all you say !
Have I been hard on you?
Haven't I given you enough freedom?
Answer!
What did i do to you
to deserve such a scandal?
I did not cause a scandal.
So what is it ?
I'm trying to make ends meet.
On the ghât, in the streets,
I'm still scared
tell me about you.
I am not afraid.
I have decided not to live here anymore.
Small town, small vision of the world.
But you live here with dignity.
My vision of the world!
It's very caring, father!
I'll pay the rent if I have to.
Look at me.
What do you want?
Are you looking for revenge?
Look at me. Avenge who?
Mom!
Your mother.
You don't even remember her.
You were only six years old!
Is a six-year-old blind?
I took her to the hospital, didn't I?
For two days she begged
to go <i> to </i> the hospital, but nothing.
Your students mattered more.
You didn't do anything.
I thought it was a simple fever.
Afterwards, it was too late.
Have I neglected you?
I left teaching for you!
I sold books
on the ghats for you!
I would have killed you mother?
What about me, would I have killed this boy?
I killed him?
He committed suicide!
You're crazy.
You make false connections.
I do not make any reconciliation.
I will defend my honor.
I won't go to jail.
You decided everything.
Me, poor idiot, I'm looking for the money.
I'll find the ransom.
Now you don't need a father anymore.
Do what you want.
I shook like a shaken bridge
In the immense forest of your eyes
Little by little my way is lost
I never thought about it.
I love them all.
How to love the seasons?
I love the monsoon!
Did you record it?
Yes, on my phone.
And I added an old tube.
Old man, you are surpassing your master!
Great gift!
She is of high caste.
Don't get carried away too quickly.
She follows
that you are of lower caste?
Tell him, and you'll see.
Not everyone
not progressive.
Yes,
I will tell him.
He has time.
A good job will fix it all.
- Ruppan, give him the keys to your motorcycle.
- Why?
He has another surprise for her.
File the keys, he pays for gasoline.
First word.
A plant?
- A lamp?
- A bowl!
Deepak!
No, not the glow of a flame.
Deepak!
Where are we going?
Where you want.
Mounted.
- Your bag?
- Sorry.
- I sit ?
- Yes go ahead.
Do you know what we call your bus?
How? 'Or' What?
The minettes' wagon.
You haven't told me where you live.
Do you see where Bhelupur is?
- Bhelupur?
- Yes. Just after.
My friend Prerna lives there.
I will go to your place
on the pretext of seeing her.
It will be funny, right?
You will come to my place?
Will your parents let you out?
If you do not want to...
No,
I didn't say go.
Here go for a second.
Your birthday present.
Put the.
Can you hear well?
Thank you.
Have you ever been to Sangam?
I have been here often.
In a few days,
we leave by bus for a pilgrimage.
We are all going <i> there </i>.
Uncle, aunt, grandfather, grandmother.
Will you come too?
- Or?
- With us.
With your family?
I have to think about it.
What?
You're the youngest, aren't you?
Yes.
How do you know?
The little ones are still talking
wrongly and through.
Ouch! Your hand is a real hammer!
It's the ring.
My uncle gave it to me
when I was little.
She's stuck.
My fingers have grown
the ring has not moved.
As I am the youngest,
everyone likes me.
Why are you looking at me like that?
I do not know.
You, the youngest one, I like you.
Shaalu.
You want to marry me?
I do not know.
Will your family accept?
I do not know.
Do you want to see them?
Will you introduce me?
You don't tell me your address,
but do you want to come to my place?
I go.
You live here?
Just around the corner, the house on the left.
And you house?
You said to Bhelupur ...
Shivala?
Kamacha!
Ah, I know.
- Durgakund, right?
- Why?
What's the matter with you?
I told you, near Bhelupur.
Can you talk about something else?
I was joking...
Do you find it funny?
Do you want to see where I live?
I'll take you there.
You will be able to satisfy your curiosity.
Come on, get on.
You want the truth?
Ghat Harishchandra.
I live there and I was born there.
Make the pyres, light them,
this is our job.
Me, my father, my brother, my uncles.
Always.
Have you ever seen a burning body?
Say, have you ever seen one burn?
I see them from morning to night.
I burn bodies, night and day.
In the fire, the skin is consumed.
The bones, the skull remain.
We split the skull with a stick,
the ashes are filtered into the Ganges.
You imagine ? Do you want to come and see?
Are you giving up your friend's pretext?
I don't have a tip?
Why?
A letter of employment from the government
deserves a good tip.
Indian Railways Contract
Are you the new employee?
Yes.
Sit down.
Ah, say ...
If you were out
two minutes later,
I would have given you my water bottle.
By the way, I am Sadhya.
Hello.
Nice guide to ticket sales.
We learned without a guide.
Not easy !
Look.
Mr. Mukherjee.
He worked here before you.
He refused to learn computers.
- Can I use it?
- Of course.
So the company transferred him
deep in Rajasthan.
Now,
he sells the tickets <i> by </i> by hand.
Do you know IT?
Yes.
Very well.
A note.
Hello.
- To go where?
- Lalpur.
Shaalu, your aunt is calling you.
You know...
You are different from other boys.
In what ?
There is a certain honesty in you.
Like the one in poetry
by Nida Fazli.
Yes, but who is Nida Fazli?
There it is, your honesty!
It is very good.
Except the onions.
The place is dirty.
It's better if it's good,
the owner is from our caste.
Are you finally calling?
It was you who reacted badly
and you are mad at me?
Sorry.
I'm not waiting for an apology.
- I am stupid !
- That is true.
I can't find the right words.
That is also true.
Where are you ?
<i> We haven't changed state yet.
We're getting there. </i>
Listen...
My parents...
They ... won't accept you.
They live in the past
with backward ideas.
But I am on your side.
Over time, they will change their mind.
Start by finding a good job.
Yes, that's what I'm trying to do.
I will do my best during the internship.
Yes, keep your spirits up!
I take care of the rest.
I will not hesitate <i> to </i> run away with you.
Take care of yourself.
Hey, KK! Let's go home!
We just left.
I have my revisions to do.
We turn around!
Other leaves, if Please.
I am in the last year
of civil engineering.
<i> At the polytechnic
Seth Kinaram Agarwal </i>
My goal is
an engineering career,
specialized in industrial design.
<i> - We're going home. I can not wait to see you.
- I'm going to have a job, come quickly. </i>
There are many left
body <i> to </i> burn.
Push the skull into the fire.
I'll go get Deepak.
Deepak!
- What?
- Standing!
Dad is still drunk.
There are <i> </i> lots of bodies.
Get up !
Nobody bumps here!
Hey, Deepak!
Wait, you dirty thief!
The next time,
I throw you on a pyre!
They didn't even cover the bodies.
Hey, Shambhu!
Go up the pyres there.
Yes, I'm going.
Take this body to the ritual bath.
Deepak!
When you are done here
mounts pyres over there.
Over there?
Yes, at the edge. As much as you can.
- Do I end up here first?
- Yes, quickly!
We need more sawdust!
Sikandar needs wood. Go ahead.
Hey, Deepak!
Come help us.
Warning.
Slowly.
Did the cops say something?
The pilgrim bus had an accident,
he fell into the Ganges.
Is that so?
Utilities have left
the bodies here.
Survivors?
No.
You know...
28 trains stop here every day.
And how many do not stop there?
64!
It's easier to come here
than to start again!
- Its very important.
- But it was strong drinks!
They are meant to be.
Can't I drink as much as you?
I do not say that.
Excuse me, could you ...
Is this post confirmed?
It was nice,
but we have to go home.
One more day.
No confirmation.
What about the last minute quota?
A place for two would suit us.
One seat, I like it.
Status:26 places available
I am not going back to this hotel!
No place.
- Cancellations?
- No.
Shit !
What shall we do now?
I am the father of Piyush.
You were at the hotel with him, huh?
- Answer!
- What are you doing? Give me the phone!
<i> It's me speaking, come home! </i>
Were you with Piyush that day?
Answer!
come to see
an exceptional competition,
like you will never see!
Jhonta!
Now ladies and gentlemen
these kids are going to dive.
Jhonta!
He is not there.
Bet on someone else.
Bet on Babua, he's great.
I bet on Babua.
- How many?
- 200 rupees.
The professor bets 200 on Babua!
Get into position.
2 ...
- Do I have something in my mouth?
- No !
I put this bullet in my mouth.
And now, l ... 2 ... and ...
Here you go.
- I deserve at least 500.
- I'll give you more next time.
Professor, how much have you lost?
Is it an hour to go home?
You hear me?
Have you become dumb?
Where were you?
I was having fun!
Are you there to work or have fun?
It's my money, what's the problem?
Shut up !
These other orphans are worthless.
Do you dare to talk to your boss like that?
You won't go anywhere
during a contest!
He takes himself for the king of Benares!
He wastes money!
I'll tell Devi!
Do as you like.
Start by sitting down!
And don't move an inch.
Sit down !
What arrogance.
You will give me your winnings from the contests.
For internships,
the subject of debate is ...
Industrialization and its effects
on the environment,
human life and society.
Hey, Deepak.
Say something.
You've been silent for too long.
Talk to us.
Leash.
Take your time.
""I love poetry.""
""You are like the train
at the misty dawn. ""
""I shook like a shaken bridge.""
""I will not hesitate
<i> to </i> run away with you. ""
This pain will never end?
Deepak, get up!
Hold my motorcycle keys, go where you want.
Shaalu!
The translation was for today.
Printers are twiddling their thumbs.
Mr. Pathak?
Everything is fine?
You will have it in three days.
Three days?
Devi isn't doing well these days.
Mr. Verma ...
an advance would be possible?
You make me hang around.
But I can't refuse.
Hold.
Good.
Excuse me.
I was delayed.
How many are there?
30,000 rupees this time.
Come with me.
Do you see this portal?
Yes.
Opposite, there is <i> there </i> a warehouse.
The junkyard Pappu.
Sell ​​that old machine
for 10 or 20,000.
We are really trying.
I think I will be able to pay soon.
It's a joke?
It is not enough.
I have to tell you how?
I'll pay the rest this week.
Take this in the meantime.
The rest this week.
And all of it next month.
- So, you sold us your bonus to Lulu?
- No way!
Sikandar sold it for 300,000.
How would Sikandar sell it
without my consent?
He's not at Mr. Kallu's.
Where the fuck is past Sikandar?
Luxa police station
The cops don't know where he is.
You found it?
What a bastard!
Fucking thief!
You motherfucker!
What constitution forbids me
to buy your bonus?
Bring that damn constitution!
Why talk about the constitution?
It's a private matter.
Find an amicable agreement.
Amicably ? I'll kill that bastard!
Pay 300,000 and I'll give it back to you
your bonus right.
Not a single rupee, you bastard!
Perhaps,
he did not pay Sikandar!
Go get Sikandar.
Ask him if I haven't paid for everything.
Where will I find 300,000?
I am nothing!
Mr. Dubey, you are a witness.
If he pays me 300,000,
I give him back his bonus right.
And thank you for insulting me.
Goodbye.
From all Benares,
you won't get a better deal.
You pay?
Sir, if you could speed up.
- Where are you going?
- Howrah.
With your goddess name,
you should have four arms
on each side.
Eight tickets in record time!
Sir, if you could speed up ...
What's in the rush?
My father says:
""Who doesn't taste kheer,
""ignore the joys of existence!""
Here, take some.
No, this is for you.
Obviously.
My father did it himself.
It is his birthday.
Okay.
- Delicious, isn't it?
- Very good.
You live alone ?
No,
i live with my father.
Father lives alone.
I mean, he's alone during the day.
From kheer?
I haven't done one for a long time,
I thought...
I have just finished dinner.
Keep it, I'll take it tomorrow.
Eat.
One of your favorite desserts.
Its good.
Is there any milk left for tomorrow morning?
What is that?
I have finished my first month of work.
My salary check.
How many?
20,000.
01:24:01.663 --> 01:24:02.831
Good.
Sit down next to me.
You didn't tell me anything
of your permanent job.
It is only temporary.
I work to win
the ransom money.
- And after that...
- Then?
I want to go to study
at Allahabad University.
I will work part time
near college.
Do you want to get out of here?
Yes.
Why?
Without this case, I would already have ...
I'm probably better off alone.
It's not far.
I will come from time to time.
And your father?
So I don't count anymore?
If you've got everything ready, then ...
Go.
I didn't kill you mother.
I will go to sleep in the ghats,
silently.
Father, please.
Please don't cry.
Write your address.
There are still narrow ways
in the mountains.
Wide track technology
will replace them in the future.
- You were major of your promotion?
- Yes sir.
We commit you to the 6-month trial,
in Allahabad.
- Thank you sir.
- Well done, congratulations.
<i> Today is the big day! </i>
Dedicate this day to the Almighty!
Long live our god Shiva ...
So everything is fine?
- Take my bet.
- How many ?
- 10,000.
- Noted.
- Do you want to win?
- Of course !
Let's see who will be the winner!
Jhonta, dive in there.
Quickly ! Faster !
Go further.
Jhonta!
Jhonta!
Munna, see you there!
Vikram, find Jhonta!
Stand aside all of you!
Make room!
Let it pass!
Jhonta!
I won't make you compete anymore,
my little.
- What?
- Did I make you lose everything?
No.
Want a magic trick?
Something in my hand?
Something in my other hand?
No.
Something in my mouth?
No.
1, 2, 3 ...
Who's is this?
It's for you.
Where is she from?
I found it while diving.
Yes, that's fine with me.
Thank you.
Here, it's hot.
I prepared this for you,
eat it on the train.
Eat, I'll finish.
Its good.
Let's go?
Call me when you arrive.
- Okay, I pure.
- Go ahead.
Don't stay near the door.
- Make yourself comfortable.
- See you soon, dad.
Don't worry, I'll take care of him.
Hello.
I am coming to see Mr. Ramdhari Agarwal.
I am Devi Pathak.
Piyush was my friend.
Let's go home to talk.

- Why come now?
Are you alright, my daughter?
Why?
What harm had he done to you?
Here is water.
30 rupees to go to Sangam!
Go up, ma'am.
And you sir?
I'll take you to Sangam.
Come.
You come <i> to </i> Sangam
for the first time ?
Yes.
And you?
The second time.
They say you have to come <i> to </i> Sangam
twice.
Why?
A first time alone,
and a second time with someone.

Honest IPS officer Aditi Singh (Tina Desai) and hard-boiled cop Rudra (Neil Nitin Mukesh) investigate a multiple suicide case. They stumble upon a darker truth revolving around the corrupt politician Yadav (Govind Namdeo) and Shankar (Manish Vatsalya). The political nexus forces Rudra to become the angry-young-man and one-man-army all rolled into one.",359,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt2759338.srt","Who is it?
Overtake him.
I've been honking for so long.
But he doesn't seem to comply.
Honk again.
Oh, so it's you.
I had no clue that you were on the bike.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have asked my driver to honk.
I would've told him to run you down.
An army of mice can't hunt down a lion.
Do I have to request all of you?
Go on.
Are you going to kill me now?
Rudra Pratap Chauhan.
Encounter Specialist.
You arrested me two.
But nothing happened.
I got bail in a jiffy.
One more thing.
I don't think you have a chance this time either.
Look there, here comes the cavalry.
One bullet, one enemy.
2 meters distance, and a few inches of grave!
File closed!
Hello sir.
Hello sir.
Sir. Sir.
Sir...you caused an earthquake on arrival.
Even I want to score half century, sir.
I mean, why didn't you take me along as well, sir?
Even I could've caused some fireworks.
And killed those brothers-in-law.
Brothers-in-law?
!
Fine, be ready to celebrate on next Diwali.
And for sweets as well.
Sweets?
Meaning, your SP madam will call me in now.
For some sweets.
May I come in?
Officer, there are other methods to do your job other than shooting someone.
A Policeman must display responsible behaviour.
And especially you, because the entire state have their eyes on you.
And, why did you have to shoot Pandari?
Can you tell me why?
One doesn't need permission to kill rats.
Get out!
Out!
I am sorry.
I am sorry...
Rudra, I am the boss in the office.
But you're the boss at home.
Sorry!
I know I was a little rude back there.
But you know, Rudra, that I was only speaking for your good.
Killing people is not the only solution.
Huh...
People like them only understand the language of violence.
But I feel...my Rudra is lost somewhere in all this commotion.
Madam...
Madam...
Search the room.
Don't miss a single object.
Yes, ma'am.
- Question the staff as well. - Yes, ma'am.
I was on duty here all night, sir.
I just left for a while to have my dinner.
In fact, the warden herself told me to go have my dinner.
- That's all I know, sir. - Okay.
- Send the bodies for post-mortem. - Okay, ma'am.
When did you last talk to your daughter?
Our daughter called us last evening.
She sounded very happy.
I don't think my daughter can ever do such a thing.
She can never commit suicide.
But the evidence that we found suggests that they committed suicide.
The question is why?
Madam, our daughter can never commit suicide.
Never.
Look, you can go for now.
Yes, madam.
But the Police can call you for investigations at any time.
- Honey. - No madam, sugar.
- Honey Singh. - Yes, madam.
- Take their statements, please. - Yes, madam.
Come, follow me.
Yes.
As the Education Minister of this Statement...
...what is your opinion about the incident that occurred in the college?
Look, I've given an ultimatum to the Chief Minister...
...and, he's assured me that the investigation
...under the supervision of SP Aditi Singh
will be fast-tracked.
A government that cannot assure the security of women in their own college...
...has no right to stay in power.
No, right at all.
But I request the media to stop making a hype of this case.
And I want the Chief Minister to resign from his post with immediate effect.
I've to attend a meeting.
Only after the party meeting, place.
And, I say this out loud.
A woman's honour, is the country's honour.
And this incident demands an unbiased investigation.
Immediately.
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!
Madam, reports.
Madam, we found four dead bodies in the room.
But there were 5 blood samples in the room.
And the 5th blood sample didn't belong to the warden.
What?
Are you positive that the 5th blood sample doesn't belong to the warden?
Positive?
Madam, believe me.
Honey Singh giving scientific answer.
Smallmouth big talking.
This suicide mystery is as complicated as Jalebi?
Jalebi?
Twisted and tasty.
Morning, sir.
Morning, sir.
Sit.
Now speak.
What is your opinion about the incident at the Women's college
and the poor administrative condition of the city?
The Women's College is an respective organisation of our state.
The entire state is proud of this organisation.
I strongly condemn the incident that occurred there.
We'll investigate to find out the reason behind why those three girls committed suicide?
I have faith in the Law and Order.
That's why I've been receiving the love of my people.
But what about those dozens of incidents that have been occurring in this state.
Kidnapping. Murder. Rape. Businessmen fleeing.
Will the people be able to maintain their faith in you in such condition?
Hey...
Enough!
You've said enough.
Don't try to show that only the media cares for the people, and we don't.
Don't try to conspire.
I am a Minister for the poor and the underprivileged and the exploited.
If people like you were the only well-wishers of the people...
...then I wouldn't be winning the elections three times.
Although you're talking nonsense.
But you tell me what I should do.
I'll do that for your sake.
Sir, daring Police officer Rudra Pratap Singh Chauhan.
The public's demand is to reinstate him in the State Crime Branch Headquarters.
Done.
I respect daring Police officers.
But...troubling innocent people in the name of honesty...
...pressing false charges against them,
deeming people as criminal on the basis of their caste.
And working only for medals and applause is completely wrong.
I don't want any Police officer to trouble the people of my state.
That's it.
- PA... - Sir.
Tell DGP sir to reinstate Rudra Pratap Singh back to Crime Branch with immediate effect.
- Order. - Yes, sir.
Okay.
Bless all of you.
Bless all of you.
Aditi.
That suicide case?
It's not a suicide.
How can you see that?
Because the prime evidences of suicide say otherwise.
Four dead bodies and five blood samples.
It has to be a case of cold-blooded murder.
Rudra.
I think I need your help.
But you know what my methods are.
You will never change.
Look Rudra, you must change your methods slightly.
For me.
Because I don't want you to get transferred again.
I mean first Bangalore, then Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, and now here.
Please.
For me.
For you...I will try.
No.
This is not their handwriting at all.
I want to see all the objects which the Police recovered from this room.
Sir.
Dubey.
Get the bag.
Here they are, sir.
I want all the details of this sim card.
Call log. Last call.
Okay.
And go to the back and find out...
...in whose name is this 500,000 rupees payslip.
There has to be a cash trail to this.
I want details of all the girls that stay in the college hostel.
95...
96...
97...
98...
Hello.
100...
Sir, the call's connected.
Good afternoon, sir.
The issue...is a little serious.
So I called personally.
The female suicide case which you are investigation...
...you must reach some conclusion quickly.
Sir, the Police are doing their job.
I assure you that the Police will soon reach some conclusion.
It's what i expect from Police officers like you.
Yes.
But please remember that the Opposition don't make an issue out of it.
Yes, sir.
Better explain to your Department's Superman.
Don't be too trigger happy.
And do his job within the limits of the Law.
Sir.
Start counting.
101...
102...
103...
- Manager? - Yes, ma'am.
Okay, SP Aditi Sing.
I want details of this Simcard.
Sure, madam.
- Please, come in. - Okay.

Sir, whose account is this?
This Simcard belongs to some Kanchan Devi.
- Address? - Woman's College and Hostel.
Road no. 12.
I want the call details.
Sir, this belongs to some Ramesh Dubey.
Good.
Address.
I am your senior.
Tell him.
You ask him, sir.
He's the senior, although he doesn't look like it,
but...
No, please tell him.
Sir, address please.
Sir, most calls have been made to 97193 7772.
And it belongs to some Ramesh Dubey.
- Last call? - Last call 81230 21115.
It belongs to some Kanchan Devi
Stop Stop.
Girls. Stop.
Excuse me, madam.
- Yes. - I want to know address.
Sector 12, 272.
Where?
- Go straight and take a left. - Okay.
Thank you.
- Can we go? - Yes.
Always embarrassing me...
Take a left.
Hello.
Rudra, I've got two important numbers.
Note them down.
This is it, sir.
12/272.
Watch me.
Is Ramesh Dubey at home.
There is no Ramesh Dubey here.
He doesn't.
He doesn't live here.
But sir, the bank gave this address.
12/272.
Ask her.
I am asking her.
- How long have you been living here? - 10 years, sir.
I see...
Dulare, wait.
Fake identity, fake address, fake everything, sir.
You know what, go back to the bank.
Again bank, sir.
Is there a problem, Honey Singh?
No, sir.
Good.
Go back.
Yes, sir. Going, sir.
Back to the bank.
- Details are not up-to-date, sir. - Doesn't matter.
When was the last transaction made?
On Wednesday 6 pm.
Money was withdrawn from the Sunder Nagar ATM, sir.
Wednesday evening... 6...
- On the day of the murder. - Yes, sir.
Anyway...I want to check the CCTV footage.
Sorry sir, actually...
I said i want to check the CCTV footage.
Now.
Sir.
- Is this the footage? - Yes, sir.
Slow it down.
- Is this at 6:30? - Yes, sir.
Pause it.
I want a picture of this man.
Sir, that looks like Contractor Pandey.
Yes, looks like him.
Do you know him?
Yes, of course.
He's a big sycophant of the Ministers.
- Shankar. - Greetings, brother-in-law.
- Where are you these days? - What's wrong?
Go and check why that Police officer took Pandey to the Police Station.
Yes.
Find out what's the issue.
- And call me back. - Okay.
Bring him here.
Great.
How did you get hold of the debit card of Ramesh Dubey?
Ramesh Dubey?
Ramesh Dubey who?
How is Ramesh Dubey connected to you...
...that you were withdrawing money from his debit card?
Money? Card?
What are you saying, madam?
I have only two cards.
Voter card. And Licence.
I can show it if you want.
And last month I even applied for an Aadhar Card (ID card) under the government scheme.
I can give you a photocopy of you wish.
Greetings, SP madam.
What are you sending, madam?
Babloo, Mantu, you guys startled me.
Brother got you bail.
Now, let's go.
Take a good look, madam.
Are all the signatures in place?
Come on, let's go, Mr. Pandey.
I'll take your leave.
So Mr. Pandey. I heard that the Police took you in.
Shankar, that new SP doesn't know how well connected I am.
And still, you got arrested.
You're the main party worker.
And, there is no one above you.
What's going on, Aditi?
What kind of investigation are you getting involved?
The girl's hostel...
Look, don't do anything to spoil the Police Department's image.
No, sir...
And, a suicide case has to be closed, that's all.
So why this running around?
But, sir...
Look, as a Lady SP...
...the Home Minister has done you a big favor.
Please don't do anything to get stripped of this.
It's an open and shut suicide case.
The report should be on my table immediately.
You'll get your chance to play Sherlock Holmes.
There are many pending cases.
Now go.
I wonder which department I am working for?
And why?
A case which is definitely a murder case...
...we barely manage to find one suspect,
but the court grants him bail.
They should've told us during the training...
...that the Police are like the three monkeys of Gandhiji.
See no evil, Hear no Evil, Say no Evil to the Criminals.
Aditi...that's the culture and system of this Department.
We've to stay within this system and fight against it.
And one doesn't need any special training for it.
Our department teaches us everything.
Fight for what?
DGP sir told me personally...
""Aditi, this is an open and shut case of suicide.""
""Make your report.""
Just do one thing for now.
Send a Suicide report file to the DGP's office.
I will have to.
You know what, it's over.
It's not over.
Its just begun.
'Yeah Rudra, I've to important numbers.
Write them down.'
The number you gave me belonged to some girl.
She's a patient in Arogya Dham Hospital.
'I found this girl in an unconscious state.'
'She had a severe injury on her head.'
'And, I found this mobile in her pocket.'
- 'No one knows about her yet.' - Good.
I don't know why, Aditi, but I feel this is our last option.
Only I know about her, and now you do.
I want this to stay between us.
And if possible, post some of your trusted people outside the hospital.
As security.
That will be good.
Your tea's gone cold.
As I said before.
The Administration will order an unbiased investigation of this case.
And that's what we did.
After a careful investigation...
...the report submitted to the Home Minister by the Department...
...it was a suicide.
The Opposition made a hype of this issue...
...and tried to spoil my image.
And I strongly condemn their action.
Give me the tobacco.
As the Chief Minister of the state...
...the law and Order of this city is my responsibility.
That's why I gave a handsfree to a talented officer like Rudra Pratap Singh.
Sir, that's free hand and not hands-free.
It's the same thing, hands-free and free hand.
But I won't take credit for it.
Rudra Pratap deserves all the accolades.
Rudra Pratap deserves the commendations.
Blessings to all of you.
- I'll come home in the evening... - Sir.
Hello.
Hello, Rudra sir.
This is Bramhanand Tripathi.
Hello.
Myself SI Dulare.
- SI Dulare? - Yes...
Isn't this Mr. Rudra's number?
Yes...
Then how did you answer his phone?
How can you keep someone else' phone?
Who gave it to you?
Who gave you this right?
- Let me talk to... - Just a minute...
Sir, its opposition leader Mr. Tripathi on the line.
I will call you back.
Yes.
Say what?
Why do you give your phone to someone else?
Look Rudra sir, in order to maintain peace and order in the city...
Pro... Prom... Porm...
What is it called?
Sir. - Promptness.
Yes, the promptness you've displayed...is truly commendable.
And that's why I called.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I am congratulating you, and you're sounding so upset.
Look, Rudra sir.
I, Brahmanand Tripathi, and my Vikas party...
...are with you all the way.
Whether you take any action or proceedings, we are with you.

ACP madam.
You said that the investigation will be unbiased.
Our daughters can never commit suicide.
Look, our investigation isn't over yet.
And just like you, even we believe that your daughters didn't commit suicide.
They have been murdered.
We'll soon find a suspect.
And believe me, whoever is behind this incident will be someone well connected.
But at that time, you shouldn't go back on your words.
Only then can we get justice for your children.
You have our full support.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This time my I've maintained Law and Order during my course.
And you guys have done your part too.
We will get the votes.
You must all strengthen the party.
And keep promoting Fodder Machine.
There is no dearth of funds.
Everyone will make a buck.
Your pockets will be jingling.
Don't worry.
I am in a hurry now.
I have a rally meeting to attend to.
We'll meet tomorrow at the same time.
Blessings to all of you.
Bring me the files I need to sign.
Sir, please read them once.
Why?
Why didn't you read them?
Was your IAS degree from Dhanbad fake?
Huh?
Should I order a CBI inquiry?
Asking me to read?
Fine, I'll call you later.
Greetings, sir.
What is it?
That College incident.
Rudra Pratap from Crime Branch has found that girl.
I see.
She's in Arogya Hospital.
And the news is that Tripathi from the Opposition is fully supporting him.
Hello.
Sir, the girl's blood matched with the blood sample that you provided.
- I am coming. - Thank you.
Sir.
- All okay. - Sir, all okay here.
But that man standing there has been pacing around the place since morning.
Who sent you?
Shankar sir.
Shankar.
Where can I find this Shankar?
Tell me.
Teli Gali, 25.
Check her first.
His name is Shankar.
He's the CM's sycophant.
I am sure he's involved in this case.
And I think he's the one who got Pandey bail.
And Pandey's been missing since that day.
But there's nothing we can do without strong evidence.
Aditi, it's like playing hide-n-seek with the crime.
The more you enjoy it, the more you'll play.
But in this game, someone will give up first.
Welcome. Welcome, DGP sir.
What is the condition of Law and Order?
All okay, sir.
- DGP sir. - Sir.
Tie it. what are you waiting for?
If I had fallen down, then so would the government.
And the media would've turned this into breaking news...
...that the government collapsed.
Do you know that?
You don't.
If you tie it, you'll get to keep your job.
Don't be shy.
Your SP's on the way too.
That's more like it.
Now shine it too.
Take your handkerchief out.
Come on.
Nice. Very nice.
Very good Mr. DGP.
Blessings!
Did you see the breaking news today?
No, sir.
The bitter truth of Democracy.
This is the Parliament House where this shameful incident occurred.
A DGP rank police officer is tying the CM's shoelace.
So what if the DGP tied my shoelace.
It's no ordinary shoelace.
And I don't want such an incident to happen to you.
I just wanted to investigate.
As long as you remain as Gandhiji's three monkeys, you will stay alive.
And the day you'll try to be a hero of your Department...
...someone will shoot you done.
I am explaining to you because you're just a kid.
See you, sir.
Aditi.
What happened?
Nothing.
Why are you so angry?
Let it be.
Dulare.
- Jai Hindi, sir. - Jai Hind.
I wanted to give you this file.
Sinha sir said it's urgent, so...
Okay.
Goodnight, sir.
Dulare brought some of your files.
Keep it, please.
What happened?
Are you going to say something?
The CM called me today.
I am coming from there.
What did the CM say?
What will he say?
Bloody corrupt man.
He was threatening me.
Threatening?
What kind of threat.
Rudra, he knows that we're still investigating this case.
He threatened to kill me.
- Hello. - Shankar has opened fire on us.
Send backup immediately.
There's been an attack on sir's house.
We must get there immediately.
Here you go, brother.
Throw it.
Careful!
Get lost! Get lost! Get lost!
Quiet.
You bark a lot.
But, that doesn't make you a lion.
What did you think?
You can barge in my home and kill me.
Huh...
I will fix the time of your death
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!
Calm down.
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!
Calm down, everyone.
I have a question.
What is this terrible time we're living in?
It's so embarrassing that the CM makes a DGP tie his shoelace.
A Police officer is attacked.
What will happen to this state?
Police officers are murdered in broad daylight.
In fact, Prasadi Lal has no right to remain the CM of this state.
And I strongly oppose his rally.
Jai Hind. Jai Bharat.
Let's go.
- Mr. Tripathi! - Long live...
- Mr. Tripathi! - Long live...
- Mr. Tripathi! - Long live...
- Mr. Tripathi! - Long live...
Where are you going?
The headquarters.
The CM's rally is today.
So now what?
Hanumant and Anjana's body has been sent for post-mortem.
It's okay.
Rudra. Everything will be fine.
Come, I'll drop you.
Come on.
Okay, see you in the evening.
- Aditi. - Yeah.
I could have...killed him today.
- Who? - Shankar.
- Rudra... - I visited CM house.
Are you mad..
But, I didn't do it.
Not because I can't kill him.
But I didn't kill him because that would've made you angry.
See you.
Hello.
Yes, Sapna.
Sir, the girl is conscious.
That's good.
Take care of her, I'll be there.
Okay.
Aditi, that girl's conscious.
I must go.
Good.
Keep updating me about every development.
I will.
Look, don't be scared.
You're safe.
You're in my house.
My name is Rudra.
I am a Police officer.
Can you tell me..
what happened with you on that day?
The CM's rally will reach Shashtri Nagar through this route.
- Mr. Mishra, you will handle Shashtri Nagar area. - Yes, ma'am.
At this turn, the rally will reach Indra Nagar.
Mr. Upadhyay, you will handle the Indra Nagar area.
My name is Pooja.
And I am the girl's hostel warden Kanchan Devi's daughter.
Come.
Sit.
What happened on that day?
All this began on our College's Annual Day function.
Our Chief guest, respect Chief Minister...
...spared some of his valuable time to attend our College's 50th Annual Day function.
And for that, I am truly obliged.
And I request him to come here and bless the children.
Calm down.
I am really happy..
..to see all the children here.
The way woman are advancing in every sector.
My hats off to all the girls.
The Women's college Student leader Sanju.
Wow!
Amazing.
She is a very talented student.
I truly commend her aspirations and talent.
I appreciate it.
Did I scare you?
How can I be scared of you?
This is how you steal my heart.
Really? Really?
What?
First...can I say something?
Did you have to talk at this time?
Okay, forget it.
I won't say it.
Okay, ...say it.
You know, if you could get me an election ticket as well.
You just climbed up a single ladder...
...and already eyeing the minister's chair.
No.
All I am asking for a ticket.
It is not a joke.
Look, whenever I ask you for a ticket, you make some excuse.
Whenever you call me, and wherever, I come immediately.
And never ask a question.
Please do this one thing for me.
Look...i even make promises to the people.
That's my habit.
You see, Shankar is my brother-in-law.
He keeps asking me for a ticket, but I don't give him.
I will when I have one.
And...if I call you, I even give you good money.
That's true.
But you see, money isn't the solution to everything.
Then what is?
I must think of my future as well.
I see...
Then let's think about the future...
One day, I was sitting with Sanju, Kavita, and Rupali, in their room.
What are you watching?
What are you watching?
I want to see too.
Pooja.
I want to see too.
This is not for you.
What do you mean?
I mean you're too young.
No, I am not.
I understand everything pretty well.
Okay, let me watch.
You'll understand when you spend time with us.
Listen, I will complain about this to my mother.
Then you'll understand.
Your mom.
Nice.
Yes, mom.
Pooja, where are you?
I am in Sanju's room.
What are you still doing in the hostel?
Don't you want to eat with me?
Food will be here soon.
What are you doing?
Yes, I am coming.
Two minutes.
You've been saying that...
Hello. Hello. Hello.
She hung up.
She's always...
Madam.
Since hostel closed down you stopped taking our calls.
We called you so many times
but why don't you answer.
There are only a few more hotties left...
...send them over for the Chief Minister.
You've already taken full advantage of Sanju.
Her holidays are due, let her go now.
Sanju is old news.
This is a new fragrance.
Look, we'll talk about this tomorrow in the office.
Please leave now.
Isn't that the same girl?
From the function?
She is very beautiful.
The Chief Minister has lost his mind
since he saw her.
Show me.
You'll get his blessings.
No Shankar.
She is my daughter.
Leave her alone.
Once I deflower her, her life will be made.
Go and tell your brother-in-law to keep his feelings in control!
Sanju has kept all his pictures pretty safely.
It won't take me too long to publish it in the newspapers.
Understand!
I can take your brother-in-law's seat from him in a jiffy.
Now get out.
Get out!
The name is Shankar Yadav.
I am the CM's brother-in-law.
And how dare you threaten my brother-in-law!
Sanju!
Sanju!
Shankar killed my mother!
What?
Killed her.
Shankar was telling my mother that you and the CM are having an affair.
Are you?
Tell me?
Are you having an affair?
He was telling my mother that you have some photos.
Sanju.
Where are those photos?
Where are those photos and videos?
Tell me.
Where are those photos?
So Sanju?
I heard you've been showing a keen interest in photography.
Take my pictures as well.
Look.
Take one.
Click it. Click it.
Didn't you want a ticket from brother-in-law?
But now it looks highly difficult.
Shankar. I will kill you!
That day when I came out of the girl's hostel,
I fell unconscious immediately.
I don't remember what happened after that.
- Can you give a statement? - Yes, sir.
You were talking about some video, photo, or MMS.
Sir, that day when I went to Sanju's room.
And asked about the photos.
'Which photos and videos?'
She hid a locket inside her t-shirt.
Locket?
- How is this connected with a locket? - I don't know, sir.
But she had a habit.
She used to keep all her photos and videos on a pen-drive.
Her...locket is her pen-drive, sir.
I am sure.
I am sure, sir.
Hello.
Ma'am, a huge crowd has gathered around here.
We'll need extra force.
Yes, I've already ordered for extra force,
and I am on my way too.
Okay.
Soon, your beloved Minister will be with you.
Please maintain silence until he arrives.
-Jai Hind, sir. -Jai Hind, sir.
- Long live - Prasadi Lal...
- Long live - Prasadi Lal...
- Long live - Prasadi Lal...
There are some people in this crowd...
...who don't want your beloved Minister's
rally to be successful.
And...
We don't want such a minister!
Who is that?
Throw him out!
Hey... Move!
Move!
What are you doing?
I said move.
'And the day you will try to be a hero of your department...'
'...someone will hunt you down.'

Rudra, what brings you here?
Come inside.
Sit.
I am resigning.
Look Rudra, even I am sad about Aditi's death.
But that doesn't mean that you resign from the Police Force.
All her life she worked within the norms of the Law.
And my mistake was...
..that I listened to her.
But what I am going to next,
I can't do it as a Police officer.
A Police officer will break the law.
Yes.
Because I know you cannot help me.
You are helpless.
So helpless that you have to tie a minister's shoelace.
My resignation.
See you.
Wait.
You're making a big mistake.
If I stop now, then no one can stop those rascals.
Do you know what it means?
Eradicating unrighteousness is not a sin.
How long will keep obeying these Minister just to save our jobs...
...and stay at their beck and call?
How long?
This uniform, which we should respect...
...but these ministers are humiliating it.
Rudra Pratap Singh Chauhan, you can do whatever you think is right.
Your Department fully supports you.
SP Aditi Singh's martyrdom won't go waste.

Give him a grand welcome.
Go on!
Kill the rascal!
My Aditi won't come back if I kill you.
But if I spare you today, then someone else might regret.
I told you, that I will fix your time of death.
Today is Dussera.

Didn't you invite him?
Blessings to all of you on the occasion of Dussera.

DGP, come here.
What kind of Ravan is this?
It took him 10 heads to abduct one Sita.

I control the people.
Did you forget what happened to your wife?
I won't kill you.
The people will kill you.
They love me a lot.
I am the king.

Don't you have anything else to say?
Go on.
Lecture me.

We are not your servants, to clean your shoes.
We are public servants.
Look...
Look what your people are saying about you.

- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!
- Prasadi Lal... - Down! Down!

Sometimes for the sake of the law and the country, you have to break the Law.
And, if I don't take an initiative now, then justice will never be done.
And justice will be done today.
Get up.

What did you say?
No. No. No.

The film opens with Ugr Pratap, the spirit master, hot on the trail of an evil spirit possessing the body of a young village girl. He tracks down the spirit but is not able to subdue it, and the girl (under the spirit) plunges to her death and curses Ugr Pratap with the annihilation of his family. This horrible curse results in the brutal deaths of Ugr Pratap's innocent family, and Ugr Pratap is accused of murdering them. The well meaning psychiatrist, Dr. Bharadwaj gets the court to send Ugr Pratap to a quiet psychiatric facility rather than the gallows. Dr. Bharadwaj explains that he, too, often encounters paranormal patients who need spiritual rather than psychiatric help, and Ugr Pratap is the only person who can help them.

Ayesha and Uday are a happily married couple living in Mumbai. One evening, as they are returning from a party, they get in a car crash. The other driver is thrown from her vehicle and smashes into their windshield and is killed on the spot. Some weeks later Uday gets a new project to revive a failing factory in Jabalpur (Uday's home town). Uday is excited to meet his old childhood friends and, more important, hopes that the change of place will help Ayesha recover from the shock from the accident.

They arrive in Jabalpur to a warm welcome from Uday's friends, and Ayesha spends the next few weeks setting up the home and planning events and visits with friends. As time goes by, strange things happen at the factory: machines inexplicably move and crash and employees are crushed, and at home, the gas range and toasters seem to have a will of their own. Ayesha is also perturbed by their immediate neighbors, the hot headed Manohar and his quietly suffering wife Urmi. The servant woman suggests consulting a local baba (healer and exorcist) who quickly concludes Ayesha is being attacked by an evil spirit. The baba suggests an exorcism but before this can be performed, the spirit, now angry, impales and kills the servant woman (with a deer head bust) and the baba. Around this time Ayesha's father hears about these strange events and quickly finds Ugr Pratap and sets off for Jabalpur.

Uday dismisses all the spirit theories and consults a doctor. Uday brings Ayesha to the factory hoping it will take her mind off the events. (Ayesha leaves their child, Sunny, with Urmi.) Ayesha notices that Uday's office has an old photograph of the factory manager and staff and among them are Manohar and Urmi. It is revealed that Manohar was the factory manager some sixty years ago and is now dead! Ayesha rushes back home in horror and runs into Urmi's house. It is uninhabited and dilapidated! Ayesha finds an old newspaper clipping which explains how Manohar was caught embezzling and was dismissed and arrested. Unable to bear this great dishonor, he poisoned his wife and child and himself. As this horrific truth dawns on Ayesha the spirits of Manohar and Urmi and their daughter show themselves. The spirit of Manohar bitterly says it will never let the factory carry on. And with that the three spirits possess Ayesha completely.

Ayesha returns home and now launches her reign of terror on the other servants. Her father and Ugr Pratap arrive just as Ayesha attacks Uday himself. Ugr Pratap fights back with his spiritual kamandal. There is a long battle as the spirit flees to the river bank and repeatedly attacks Ugr Pratap. Uday finally plunges the charmed trisul (trident) into Ayesha and dispatches all the spirits to the other worlds. The film ends as Uday and Ayesha return home and find their son nearly drowned but unhurt. Ugr Pratap vows to continue fighting evil in the world.",3648,NA,NA,NA
"73","tt1841542","Chillar Party",2011,"Plot

Eight innocent but feisty kids lead carefree lives in Chandan Nagar, a colony in Mumbai, where each has his own identity and a nickname based on these qualities. Not only that, but their whole team has a nickname that has earned them significant notoriety, ""Chillar Party"". They have mainly two enemies – the 'oversized' neighbouring cricket team, to whom they always lose, and a dog they named ""Loose Motion,"" since she dirties their cricket pitch, so they develop an enmity against dogs.

Their hopes are shattered shortly after a boy, Fatka, who was employed for washing the cars of the society, enters with his dog Bhidu. They do everything to throw the boy and his dog out, but become unsuccessful. Eventually they develop a friendship with each other as Fatka helps them by serving as the lead bowler during the match with the neighbouring cricket team. During this time, they also start interacting with a young girl who moves in and an unemployed youngster who becomes successful after Fatka helps him out.

But their happiness is short-lived when a reckless politician, welfare minister Shashikant Bhide, enters their life after his personal secretary Dubey is attacked by Bhidu for hurting Fatka. Bhide announces in a news telecast that all the stray dogs roaming about in residential buildings in Mumbai will be caught and terminated, misleading audiences with a concern for public safety. He further informs that the dog(s) can only be saved if the society files a No Objection Certificate within 1 month. The kids, shocked by this, strive hard to get the NOC, wherein they have to get at least more than 50% votes of the total residents in the society, i.e., 31 votes. But they manage only 10 votes after 15 days.

With more efforts gone in vain, the kids finally organize a march across the streets purely in underwear. This gains them enough traction to pull 10 more votes. With more hard work and awareness, they manage to get another 10 votes, counting a total of 30 votes. With only a day left for the deadline as declared by Bhide, they approach secretary L.N. Tandon, who is close to Bhide and has resented the kids all this while. While all this chaos is going on, a TV channel invites Bhide and the kids for face-off. Seeing this as their last chance, they attend the interview, which is being telecast across India. Knowing that that is the last day and dog catchers are after Bhidu, they pray hard to save him.

During the interview, they are constantly mocked by Bhide, who questions their education and upbringing, but it soon takes a turn and culminates in the kids answering Bhide back with their moral education responses. Having won, the kids plead to leave after a moving speech by Fatka, and the interviewers agree. When they reach the society, they are disheartened as there is no sight of Bhidu. Suddenly, Bhidu comes jumping in, wearing a collar reading ""Bhidu-Chandan Nagar Society."" While they are happy seeing Bhidu, they realize Tandon changed his mind after the face-off; he too is happy and seen cheering for them.",3061,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt1841542.srt","<i>Poor parents.</i>

We should never watch

call you 'Unlucky'?
Maybe because I am unlucky.

-No!

It's homework.
So now they're teaching
kids to cook in school!
Carry on.
It will be useful when you grow up!
Hang on.
Take some vegetables too.
It's a basic course, not advanced.
So what do we make with this flour?
Dog poop!
Black pepper.
Mold.
Orange poop?
It looks like this
when I have orange juice.
Idiot, add some yellow to it.
What is this?
Poop.
Who did this, Sir?
Not him, he is my business partner.
Buddy would never do such a thing.
What kind of a dog would
climb up to poop like this?
Wow! It looks so real!
Nice and healthy!
Poop is never healthy.
It's just nitrogenous waste.
What are you doing? Don't touch it.
It's fake.
-Throw it away!
-Sir, just smell it.
I will give you one tight slap!
Throw it away.
Throw it away from the car!
No! We forgot to add the odor.
You should've farted on the poop!
Bloody Chillar Party!
Hurry up!
Hey, you! Pass the ball.
Buddy, step aside.
A new problem everyday!
Why don't these kids like us?
Anyway why should it matter to us!
Where is the washcloth?
It was right here.
Buddy, have you seen our washcloth?
This guy is tough.
But no match for us.
-Want a bite?
-No, thanks.
Buddy!
Buddy!
Buddy!
Come out. Here's your birthday gift.
Buddy?
Buddy!
Buddy!
Buddy!
Buddy!
Buddy!
Buddy!
Buddy!
-What's wrong?
-Have you seen Buddy?
Buddy!
Buddy!
Buddy!
Buddy!
Buddy!

What's the matter, Arjun?
Mom...
if I'm mean to someone...
who has done nothing mean to me
then am I a bad boy?
Well, if you are feeling
guilty about it...
then you are still a good boy.
Finally.
Now his fragile body will
get some glucose and carbohydrates.
There goes your brain ticking again.
Why don't you think with your heart,
for a change?
Where are you going?
For Group Studies.
There's a lot of pressure!
Wow! You're growing up!
I don't think so.
What about tomorrow's match?
What about the team's captain?
There he is.
He's injured!
I'm sorry. I didn't do my homework.
Our super-fast bowler is injured!
While their striker Shoaib Akhtar...
is getting bigger
and stronger every minute!
He can really pack a punch!
In the last match, he knocked off
our five batsmen.
And my head too.
Well, we do have a back up.
In our colony? Who?
Janghya!
Me? Thanks, man!
Go get the kid with the dog.
Fast bowler!
Chillar Party wants to talk to you.
About what?
He wants to know why.
Don't you know?
We need a fast bowler!
We need a fast bowler!
So, big deal!
So, big deal!
It's for our colony's
pride and honor.
And he belongs to this colony.
What was that again?
It's for our colony's pride and
honor and you're a part of it.
Fine. But first you have to say sorry.
I want everyone to say sorry.
I am saying sorry on their behalf as well.
That's not good enough.
Everybody has say sorry.
Wonderful!
Chillar Party is on
their way to lose again!
Let's start.
Hold on. Where's Shoaib?
Let's toss?
Five minutes!
Where's Shoaib?
Hey! Mummy!
Go away!
And Fatka scores the first boundary.
<i>Don't worry</i>
<i>Give others worry!</i>
<i>He who messes with you</i>
<i>Give him a thrashing</i>
<i>Don't fry my brains</i>
<i>Move aside</i>
<i>Just move aside</i>
<i>I am coming</i>
<i>Listen to me carefully</i>
<i>I am coming</i>
<i>Listen to me carefully</i>
Attention everyone!
Though everyone played very well.
Only one player can
be named Man of the Match.
Janghya!
Me?
Get the garland.
Man of the match!
""Janghya, get the garland.""
Janghya, come fast!
Buddy!
<i>Sometimes they fight</i>
<i>Sometimes they are stubborn</i>
<i>Sometimes they are</i>
<i>At each other's throat</i>
<i>But they became friends eventually</i>
<i>They are sweet</i>
<i>They are spicy</i>

<i>Now they are one gang</i>
<i>Now they are one gang</i>
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

I hate milk.
But my mom forces me to have it.
You're so lucky.
If you don't drink milk you'll
get something else to eat or drink.
At least you don't go
to bed on an empty stomach.
I get to eat on some days.
Or I go to bed hungry.
That's why I have
no complaints about milk.
<i>Like little chicks</i>
<i>They are always together</i>
<i>Always running here and there</i>
<i>In a group</i>
<i>They are different colors of Holi</i>
<i>They are different,</i>
<i>But they are together</i>
<i>When they are on your face,</i>
<i>They all look the same</i>
<i>One is laughing</i>
<i>Another one doesn't have a single penny</i>
<i>They are all different</i>
<i>It doesn't matter to them</i>
<i>They are sweet</i>
<i>They are spicy</i>
<i>Now they are one gang</i>
<i>Now they are one gang</i>
<i>Now they are one gang</i>
I envy your life.
You're a free bird.
No one sets rules for you.
Like our parents do.
Your mom cooks for you...
and pampers you.
Your father works hard all day.
So that you can get a good education.
When you fall ill,
your parents look after you.
Fine, no one sets rules for me.
But then, no one is there
to love me either.
Still envy my life?
<i>They are just like pretzels</i>
<i>They just came out of a pan</i>
<i>They are twisted and hot,</i>
<i>But they are sweet</i>
<i>They are a gist of wind</i>
<i>You can't get hold of them</i>
<i>They will blow</i>
<i>In the direction they wish</i>
<i>One gets mother's love</i>
<i>Another one faces thorns on his way</i>
<i>Their destinations are different,</i>
<i>But their path is same</i>
<i>They are sweet</i>
<i>They are spicy</i>
<i>Now they are one gang</i>

<i>Now they are one gang</i>

This colony is called Chandan Nagar.
So why do you all
call it Cartoon Network?
Because everyone here is a cartoon.
That's Mr. Boring!
He's unbearable!
-Hello!
-Where are you going?
There goes Akram!
I've seen you play,
show me your batting stance.
That's not the way you hold the bat.
It's not proper.
Your fingers should be parallel
and your top hand should be heavy.
Parallel fingers are
of utmost importance.
And remember, chin on your shoulder.
Do you want me to bowl to you?
Can I bowl?
-Are you going to spin the ball?
-No, it will be a fast ball.
-Fast?
-Okay?
Okay.
Parallel fingers, chin...
it should be like this always.
Don't bowl on my legs, okay?
Hello, how are you?
Okay?
She is the superstar of our colony.
Toothpaste.
Superstar?
Haven't you seen her on TV?
She's the one!
She thinks she's
a star and ignores us.
But I kind of like her.
Chillar party!
And who's this guy?
He is Googly.
Googly?
Just listen to him!
Hello!
It's surprising to
see you all together!
What's the occasion?
See you later.
-Bye, uncle.
-Bye.
How was that?
God has a wicked sense of humor.
He's made a truck and
given it the horn of a cycle.
His voice dwarfs his talent,
keeps him jobless.
<i>We learnt a lot from Fatka.</i>
<i>Even some things that we shouldn't have.</i>
What's up, old chap?
So you've found your way home!
You should have had
lunch with that punk.
Don't be a pain, mom!
I'm beat.
Don't mess with me.
Come again?
What's eating you up?
Take a chill pill.
""What's eating me up?""
""Take a chill pill?""
-No, mom!
-Let it go!
Is this what you are learning?
-Stop it.
-I'll teach you a lesson.
-Stop it.
-Shameless.
Don't worry, son.
Who will describe Mahatma Gandhi?
-I will. I will, madam.
-Balwan?
Gandhi was that dude from India
who had sent the
Brit losers packing.
Got it?
Don't you take interest in your child?
""Gandhi the dude?""
What if all the kids
start speaking this way?
Is this what you teach your kids?
<i>Jack and Jill went up the hill</i>
<i>And planned to do some kissing</i>
<i>Jack made a pass,</i>
<i>And grabbed her back</i>
<i>And now two of his front teeth are missing</i>
Applaud, you idiots!
Goodnight, son.
Mom that's not how you say it.
So how do you say it?
Eat out, slurp in, burp out, crash in!
Go wish your dad good night.
That's not how you say it, dad.
Eat out, slurp in, burp out, crash in!
If you go out to meet
Fatka, I'll thrash you.
Let's meet tomorrow.
-Please, dad.
-When?
Dad, just a minute.
Why? You are not going anywhere.
Stay here.
He has a fever, Dad.
No. In fact, you've got
the loitering fever.
Got it? Get inside or
you'll get a spanking.
Take him home.
It's curfew at home.
Same here.
Everyone's angry...
and he is too sick to clean the cars.
<i>Fatka could lose his job.</i>
Do you have an alarm clock?
Of course!
At 5:45 a.m, Mr. Rooster
comes out in his balcony.
We must finish by then.
Hey, H2O, did you see anything?
Yes.
Even we have seen things.
Going to the movies lately
with a certain Mr. Sharma's maid?
Do you still remember seeing this?
No.
Great, we'll forget
your movie visits too!
Alright. Get lost.
What?
The rooster!
Hurry up. Hide.
Who did this?
Catch it, catch it!
Come!
Come, come. One more!
Oh, no!
Are you guys not talking anymore?
Why not?
Their parents aren't
too happy about it.
What do they say?
They think I'm a bad kid.
Buddy, doesn't care.
He likes me for who I am.
I wish my interviewers
were as considerate.
May I say something?
I hope you don't mind.
Go ahead.
I was thinking about you.
You were?
Your audio and video don't match.
I know.
What if you only use your voice?
What do you mean?
No one knows if it's
a boy or a girl on the radio.
I am Manisha...
and you are listening to 98.3 FM,
Radio Mirchi. It's hot!
And here's a brand new show,
<i>Morning Masala.</i>
Let's begin this bright
morning with a bright number.
In life...
we often fail to understand people.
People didn't understand me.
And we...
failed to understand him.
He might come across as shabby...
but his advice got me a job.
Or should I say, got my voice a job.
D.J, hit the bass!
How the times have changed, Dubey.
Earlier, I'd be invited
for bridge inaugurations.
And now it's come down
to a kids' playground.
All thanks to the recession, sir.
Tie this ribbon properly.
-Put up the ribbon!
-It will be done.
-Yes.
-Come on.
Come on.
Sir, it's Tandon.
-Yes, Mr. Tandon.
<i>-Greetings, sir.</i>
Are there enough people to welcome us?
Or is this a waste of time?
-No, sir. There are enough people.
-Very good.
-Okay, sir. We are waiting for you.
-Yes, we'll be there soon.
He's got a crowd he says!
-Welcome, sir.
-How are you doing, Mr. Tandon?
-Fine, Sir. Thanks to you.
-Greetings.
-You didn't have to do this.
-It's my pleasure, sir.
This is Mr. Sharma,
in charge of maintaining the garden.
Very well done.
Come, sir.
He is the Treasurer of
our block, Mr. Iyer.
Welcome, sir.
Kids, move aside.
How nice!
Dogs are also here to welcome me!
Go ahead. I'll take care of this.
Welcome, sir.
Whose dog is this?
Get him out of here.
Why, sir?
-Are you arguing with me?
-No, sir!
Take him and get out of here.
You're here for a free lunch?
Why do you say that?
Applause!
Didn't you hear me? Just go away!
Uncle, stop! Don't hit him!
Where do you get the time, sir?
Don't, Buddy.
-What's going on?
-I don't know, sir.
Move away.
The dog attacked me, sir.
Take him away.
Fatka, get him away.
Fatka, get him away.
What happened?
The dog attacked me, sir.
Dubey...
Whose dog is this?
-Sir...
-Whose dog is this?
-Whose dog is this?
-Sir...
He's ours.
Sir, these children
are from my colony.
It was my mistake.
I should have crushed its neck.
If you'd done that...
we would've lost a good opportunity.
Do you have any issue...
that will get us into
the limelight again?
An issue?
Dubey...
politics thrives on issues,
and today we were served one.
Now watch me make a mountain
out of this molehill.
<i>In Mumbai, Welfare Minister</i>
<i>Mr. Shashikant Bhide...</i>
<i>has launched a campaign</i>
<i>against stray dogs.</i>
<i>He had this to say to our reporters.</i>
<i>If my secretary is not safe</i>
<i>from stray dogs...</i>
<i>how can the common man feel safe?</i>
<i>That's why the nuisance</i>
<i>of stray dogs must end.</i>
<i>For a safe Mumbai.</i>
But, sir, not all stray
dogs are dangerous.
Will you let me finish?
<i>We are not against all stray dogs.</i>
<i>If people feel that the stray dogs</i>
<i>living around them are not dangerous</i>
<i>then they can get them an N.O.C.</i>
<i>i.e. No Objection Certificate.</i>
<i>And they have a month to do this.</i>
<i>After a month,</i>
<i>dogs without an N.O. C</i>
<i>will have no place in the city.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Let's create a safer Mumbai.</i>
<i>These are minister Bhide's orders.</i>
<i>Dogs like Buddy, beware.</i>
<i>Try saving yourself.</i>
<i>Tandon, Bhide here.</i>
Did you watch the news?
Yes, sir.
So to make this mission a success...
capturing that dog is vital.
Yes, of course.
Because that dog sparked the war.
Don't worry, sir. I'll handle it.
<i>Buddy stood up for his friend.</i>
<i>So how could Buddy be wrong?</i>
Don't worry, we will get the N.O.C.
My dad will handle it.
My dad fears nothing, not even ghosts.
Our decision is that
this dog won't get an N.O.C.
And our decision is...
Buddy won't go from here.
<i>We decided we wouldn't let Buddy go</i>
<i>but we forgot that we were only kids.</i>
Rama Shankar.
Enough of this doggy nonsense!
Come on!
No! I won't leave Buddy!
Let go of me!
We won't let him go!
We won't let him go!
They are only kids they'll
be fine in the morning.
<i>Console us, make us laugh</i>
<i>Run your hand across our hair</i>
<i>We will become quiet</i>
<i>We are kids</i>
<i>We are a bit immature</i>
<i>We will become quiet</i>
<i>If I lack something</i>
<i>Or others lack something</i>
<i>I wonder why everyone thinks</i>
<i>Kids don't have any feelings</i>
<i>Console us, make us laugh</i>
<i>Run your hand across our hair</i>
<i>We will become quiet</i>
<i>We are kids</i>
<i>We are a bit immature</i>
<i>We will become quiet</i>
So what's an N.O.C?
Very simple. Even Janghya knows this!
Right, Janghya?
Just like there is MIB...
and LOTR, there is N.O.C.
What does it mean?
Don't you get it?
In MIB, M stands for Men.
In LOTR, L stands for Lord.
Similarly N.O.C. stands for...
No objection certificate.
Hey, I was getting there!
I've never got a
certificate for anything.
Why do we need a certificate?
It is a certificate from the society
that allows Buddy
to stay in the colony.
But our colony people are against it.
What is this?
It's our colony Rulebook.
It says that if more than
50 percent of the residents agree...
then Buddy can get an N.O.C.
Then even Tandon uncle
can't do anything.
There are 60 apartments in our block.
What's 50 percent of that?
That means we need 31 signatures.
So we have to go to 31 apartments?
Long live the Revolution!
Are you all with me?
-Long live the Revolution!
-Silence!
We've decided, we'll fight for Buddy.
And we will fight till the end.
If they slap us on one cheek...
we'll slap them on both.
Right?
He said yes.
So what's the strategy?
We have only 27 days...
to get the signatures
from our parents and neighbors.
If I ask my dad for a signature,
he will spank me.
Do you want to save Buddy?
-Yes or no?
-Yes.
Get kicked or slapped or shouted at.
Do whatever it takes.
But get the signature.
So, what's an N.O.C?
No Objection Certificate!
<i>Get kicked or slapped or shouted at.</i>
<i>Do whatever it takes.</i>
<i>But get the signature.</i>
Dad?
Dad...
What is it?
-I won't sign.
-Please!
I told you once. Now get lost!
If he wants the moon,
should I get him that too?
I don't have time for your nonsense.
Focus on your grades!
Hey! You won't get it!
Shut up!
You think you'll be
able to accomplish this?
<i>-So...</i>
<i>-Sign.</i>
I'll sign,
but to protest you must sing songs.
Like...
<i>-Let's revolt!</i>
<i>-Sign...</i>
-Very good!
-Now sign.
Wait, there's more.
<i>Revolt...</i>
-Can you sing in a higher pitch?
-Alright.
<i>We'll do or die now!</i>
-You kids are doing a noble deed.
-Uncle, sign please.
-Where do you want me to sign?
-No signature!
You expect me to sign this nonsense?
Right, darling?
-Sorry.
-I understand.
I told them no a thousand times!
He's scared of his wife.
Just like my dad.
Nice muscles, bro!
What do you want?
Can you get dad's signature?
Did you fail again?
No, we want to pass Buddy's petition.
Alright.
Even a movie star doesn't
create such drama for an autograph.
<i>Get kicked or slapped or shouted at.</i>
<i>Do whatever it takes.</i>
Dad.
<i>But get that signature.</i>
-You want me to sign?
-Yes.
Give it to me.
You'll have to dance for me.
Start.
<i>Come squeeze the heart</i>
<i>Break the pot at night</i>
Now dance to this.
<i>My hopes are burning in my heart</i>
Not good enough. Get lost.
Get out!
Get lost!
Don't come back here.
What a waste!
Dad.
Thank you, Dad!
You want me to complain to your dad?
Get lost!
Didn't I say no?
No, thanks.
-Please?
-No!
But I'm not signing!
What?
You stole my banana!
What?
Look at me and say it!
What happened?
After so much of effort,
we have only 10 signatures.
It's so frustrating!
-Buddy?
-Buddy...
Why are they refusing to sign?
What is their problem?
They're afraid of the minister!
He scares them.
What's wrong?
What's bothering you?
I'm wondering why everyone
is afraid of the minister.
Because he is very powerful.
How?
He has public support!
And that makes a person powerful?
Yes.
You think even we should
approach the public?
If you truly believe
in what you're doing, then why not.
If I do this, dad will scold me!
If your actions bring about something
good, then it's all worth it.
This glum look doesn't suit you.
Are you here to mock us?
I'm here to help you.
How do you expect to do that?
You're also a kid and kids
are never taken seriously.
You think you're super smart in here
but in the real world?
What do you know about the real world?
I know you call me ""Toothpaste.""
Because you're on TV!
So if you want to be seen and heard
and match up to the Minister
you have to go on TV, like me!
How's that possible?
What's the big deal?
These days even a hen laying five eggs
qualifies as breaking news.
But what will be our breaking news?
Our Buddy doesn't even lay eggs.
Does he?
Good morning, son.
Mom, where is the newspaper?
Since when did you start
reading the newspaper?
Please, mom!
Go take it from your brother.
Even the newspaper is a hand-me-down!
<i>This news is a real eye opener!</i>
<i>We'll be back after the sensational</i>
<i>story of a criminal...</i>
<i>Another breaking news!</i>
<i>A beard that cures jaundice.</i>
Does this make any sense?
Let me watch!
<i>Osama Bin Laden issued</i>
<i>another warning.</i>
<i>And with that the</i>
<i>stock market crashed.</i>
<i>People sold their shares.</i>
<i>How will this phenomenon</i>
<i>affect our markets?</i>
<i>We will keep you informed.</i>
<i>Today's big debate,</i>
<i>what would be Osama's next step?</i>
Have you heard of Osama Bin Laden?
No.
Don't you watch the news?
Oh, God!
The world is doomed!
Have you heard of Osama Bin Laden?
Yeah.
You watch the news!
Why is everyone in Chandan Nagar
refusing to sign the petition?
Who will win the due
between the pen and the sword?
What did he say?
Who? Tell me, who?
Who is keeping apart two friends?
When will the wait end...
for these innocent kids?
The kid is a dog-whisperer
but nobody believes it!
-You talk to Buddy, don't you?
-Well...
-Don't you?
-Yeah.
But how do we get the
reporters to hear this?
And here is some amazing news
<i>a dog named Buddy in</i>
<i>Chandan Nagar, talks to people!</i>
<i>If you can't believe this...</i>
go there and see for yourself.
Googly said that a lot
of reporters will show up.
They'll ask a lot of questions
but don't be scared, okay?
Nothing scares me.
You think you can handle this?
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.
I think...
So, how many reporters?
Not even one.
I think nobody will show up.
Kids, there's a reporter here!
-Reporter?
-Reporter?
Hey, Unlucky,
you should have said that earlier.
The talking dog lives here, right?
Yes.
Ten copies of The Daily Sensation!
30 rupees.
Make that one.
Three rupees.
Here! Over here!
Talking dog in Chandan Nagar.
The kids of Chandan Nagar
are trying to save Buddy
from the law passed by
Minister Shashikant Bhide.
For this they need 31 votes
and have succeeded in getting 10 votes.
The article also says
that they want public support
to save the talking dog.
That will help them
gather enough votes...
to keep Buddy safe
from the minister's law.
How immature!
Interesting.
Sir, nobody reads this rubbish.
Dubey...
it might be a small spark.
But it must be doused...
before it becomes a wild fire.
Mr. Bhide has sent this for you.
He wants to have a word with you.
Hello, Tandon.
Chandan Nagar is getting famous.
I had no idea.
Of course!
You were caught sleeping!
<i>You didn't even realize...</i>
that the kids in your
colony have outwitted you.
You've been fooled!
Sir...
Be ready to read tomorrow's headline.
And it will appear
in every newspaper.
""Chandan Nagar Colony's
Secretary arrested.""
But why, sir?
He employs children as labor.
And, I'm sure you know...
that child labor is a crime.
Sir...
So, think about it, Tandon.
You either go to prison
or you fire the kid!
Good night...
and sleep...
No, hold your pants tight.
Very funny.
Good night, hold your pants tight.
We got five more signatures!
Don't worry, we will get
the rest of the signatures
and Buddy won't go anywhere.
What's the matter, Fatka?
Answer the door.
Laxman?
-What are you doing here at this hour?
-What?
-What!
-What happened?
Lucky!
What is it?
Fatka got fired.
<i>Like little chicks</i>
<i>They are always together</i>
<i>Always running here and there</i>
<i>In a group</i>
<i>They are different colors of Holi</i>
<i>They are different,</i>
<i>But they are together</i>
<i>When they are on your face,</i>
<i>They all look the same</i>
<i>One is laughing</i>
<i>Another one doesn't have a single penny</i>
<i>They are all different</i>
<i>But it doesn't matter to them</i>
<i>They are sweet</i>
<i>They are spicy</i>
<i>Now they are one gang</i>
<i>Now they are one gang</i>
<i>Now they are one gang</i>
<i>Now they are one gang</i>
<i>Now they are one gang</i>
It's a crime for adults
to employ children.
But, Dad...
Arjun, it's against the law.
There's nothing we can do.
Fatka is an orphan.
If he doesn't work,
he won't have any money.
He'll starve.
The kids are devastated.
There has to be a way out.
I'm helpless.
The minister has a personal
interest in this case.
-Personal interest?
-Yes.
The kids are to blame.
Tell me, why did they have to print
-the talking dog story?
-I know--
That's what led to all this!
The law says it's a crime for
adults to employ children.
But there's no law that says
that a kid can't employ a kid!
Don't clean their cars,
you can clean our bicycles.
And we will pay you
from our pocket money.
We won't give up so easily.
<i>They are stubborn</i>
<i>Very stubborn</i>
Long Live the Revolution!
Balwan, come home, right now!
Forget it!
Coming, Mom!
Where's Lucky?
He's out with his friends.
What about his homework?
He completed all of it.
Yes.
That's very sweet of you.
We'll put it on Buddy
when he gets the N.O.C.
We need 16 more signatures.
And only seven days to go.
We have even run out of 'Breaking News.'
But we have to do something.
Something that makes
the front page headlines!
With photographs.
So what do we do?
Walk around the city in our underwear?
Do you have the guts to pull that off?
-I was just kidding--
-Do you have the guts?
You think it'll help?
It just might.
Let's do it.
But half a dozen kids won't help.
<i>We had to go ahead</i>
<i>with the underwear march</i>
<i>but to make it huge,</i>
<i>we urgently needed some money.</i>
Hello, sir. Fatka here.
I used to work in your hotel.
Sir, I need some money.
I'll return it next month.
No, not for illegal work.
Okay, Sir. Bye.
Where did all this money come from?
Are you doing something
you're not supposed to?
I've been saving money
to buy new clothes.
But nothing is more
important than Buddy.
Hold on! Stop!
We need to rock it.
It's an undie parade.
<i>While adults might not support us</i>

They'll be in their underwear!
What do I choose? I choose this.
This?
This!
Don't pressurize me, man.
You know I don't wear underwear.
Jhangya's not here, is he?
It's my dad's!

From the new law
that the Minister has passed!
-Long Live the Revolution!
-Buddy!
Buddy! Buddy!
Buddy! Buddy!
BUDDY VS BHIDE.
Buddy! Buddy!
-Have you seen my white underwear?
-Yes.
-It's right there, on TV!

<i>We look after stray dogs.</i>
<i>We can issue an N.O.C for</i>
<i>Buddy and keep him with us.</i>
<i>But then he won't be with us.</i>
<i>And it won't be worth fighting for.</i>
<i>Buddy! Buddy!</i>
<i>Buddy! Buddy!</i>
<i>This city belongs to Buddy too.</i>
<i>Who are we to decide his fate?</i>
<i>I think he deserves an N.O.C!</i>
<i>What do you think?</i>
<i>-He should get an N.O.C.</i>
<i>-And you?</i>
<i>If I lived in that colony,</i>
<i>I would've granted him an N.O.C.</i>
<i>The public verdict is</i>
<i>that Buddy deserves an N.O.C.</i>
<i>With cameraman Manoj,</i>
<i>this is Aditi for Zee News.</i>
<i>As you can see thousands</i>
<i>of kids have gathered here...</i>
Hello? Yes.
Tell them I'm busy.
<i>Everyone's saying just one slogan.</i>
It's the Chief Minister.
<i>-Save Buddy!</i>
-Chief Minister.
<i>I have only one question for you</i>
<i>are you with them in the protest?</i>
Yes, sir?
How many votes have the
kids managed to get?
We're short of one signature.
And one day to go!
How do we get that signature?
Sir, congratulations!
The dog is history,
I had a word with Tandon.
There are no more signatories
to sign the petition.
The final decision will be
taken tomorrow, anyway.
No, Dubey.
These kids have insulted
me on national television.
It's time to avenge that insult.
They like showing off their
underwear, don't they?
The dog is gone!
Now, I'll strip them
on national television.
I'll make them beg for mercy.
<i>These things can be solved amicably.</i>
<i>The kids think I've been unfair...</i>
<i>but they shouldn't have</i>
<i>paraded in their underwear.</i>
<i>Instigating other kids is wrong.</i>
Let them come...
<i>and discuss it with me on the TV.</i>
<i>LIVE. Heart to heart.</i>
But why on TV?
I want the people to know...
that their welfare and interests
are important to me.
<i>A safe Mumbai...</i>
<i>is a happy Mumbai.</i>
<i>Thank you!</i>
<i>Minister Bhide has invited the children to</i>
<i>discuss their problem live on television.</i>
<i>Now we have to see...</i>
<i>if the kids will show up</i>
<i>to debate with Mr. Bhide.</i>
<i>The entire nation awaits.</i>
<i>Moreover...</i>
Yes?
Yes, Mr. Saxena.
-Hello.
-Hello.
-Hello.
-Hello.
<i>We'd like to remind you</i>
<i>that exactly a month ago...</i>
The Minister had...
I didn't favour the protest.
But my son insisted and I gave in.
The Minister is a jerk.
He enjoys troubling the kids.
I think the kids did great.
The newspaper published the story.
<i>The children had the undie</i>
<i>parade and it's all right.</i>
But now it's time
to put a stop to this.
What will they do on TV?
The minister will rip them apart.
-And all for a dog.
-Yes.
They should just forget about this.
I agree...
but there's something
you haven't realised.
This fight isn't
about the dog anymore.
It's about the kids.
Our kids have fought
this battle on their own.
And at this hour of reckoning...
we want them to surrender?
So what do you expect?
You want us to see our
kids get humiliated?
I am not saying that!
If they'll be laughed at, so be it.
The defeat will be worth it.
At least they won't be termed as cowards.
I feel like thrashing the minister.
One thing is certain.
-The kids have been very brave.
-Yes.
Mr. Saxena...
I don't know about the other kids...
but our kids will
surely put up a fight.
Mr. Iyer...
our kids have fought
this battle as a team.
If they go, they go together!
At least I want all of them to go.
I believe they should go.
We should let them go.
Remember this.
Whether you win or lose out there...
for us you'll always be victorious.
<i>None of us slept that night.</i>
<i>Maybe it was our</i>
<i>last night with Buddy.</i>
We will go to the studio after school.
You can come with Googly.
Okay.
It's an important day for you.
You should wear a new shirt.
If Buddy gets the last vote
before the dog squad arrives...
please put this collar on him.
-They are just kids.
-They will be fine. Don't worry.
Don't be scared.
Don't bite the dust this time.
Don't spare the Minister!
<i>Console us, make us laugh</i>
<i>Run your hand across our hair</i>
<i>We will become quiet</i>
<i>We are kids</i>
<i>We are a bit immature</i>
<i>We will become quiet</i>
<i>We fell in a moment,</i>
<i>We stood up again</i>
<i>I wonder why everyone thinks</i>
<i>Kids don't have any feelings</i>
<i>Today is the day of the verdict.</i>
<i>Final verdict will be passed</i>
<i>on the Buddy Vs Bhide case.</i>
<i>Praise us to the sky and leave</i>
<i>We will become quiet</i>
<i>We are kids</i>
<i>We are a bit immature</i>
<i>We will become quiet</i>
<i>It all began when Buddy</i>
<i>attacked Shashikant Bhide's PA.</i>
<i>This minor issue has now snowballed</i>
<i>into such a major fight.</i>
<i>And today you will</i>
<i>have to take the decision</i>
<i>whether the verdict should</i>

<i>or in favor of the minister.</i>
<i>Just distract us a bit</i>

Hello and welcome to
<i>The Battle Hour.</i>
Today's episode is one of a kind.
On my right is Mr. Shashikant Bhide
who began the drive to put an end
to Mumbai's stray dog nuisance.
<i>The drive is scheduled to start today.</i>
And on my left,
are the kids from Chandan Nagar.
They've managed the impossible in
trying to keep their dog, Buddy safe.
<i>So there's a lot to look</i>
<i>forward to in today's show.</i>
Hello, kids!
It's nice to see you dressed today.
I was afraid you might
show up in your underwear.
I am scared of these kids.
Because they are the
future of our nation.
If the future of our
nation is built on lies...
it's a matter of grave concern.
They lied when their
colony refused the N.O.C.
They claimed one of them
could talk with the dog.
And the story got published,
to humor the kids.
Am I right?
When that did not work,
they resorted to cheap tactics.
They instigated the kids of
our city to parade in their underwear.
Why?
<i>To prove that they</i>
<i>are right and I am wrong.</i>
Am I wrong?
I'm trying to get rid of stray dogs.
Is their colony at fault?
The residents don't want
stray dogs in their colony.
If dad does not get ice
cream for their children...
he becomes a bad father.
Doesn't he?
The residents opposed the dog,
hence they are bad.
The Minister is bad!
Do you go to school?
Of course. you do!
Well...
I'd like to see...
what you're taught in school.
This book doesn't teach
you to lie or create a nuisance.
<i>Where did you learn that?</i>
Tell me.
From your parents?
Teachers?
<i>Why aren't you answering?</i>
Answer me!
Where did you learn all this?
I don't think they
have anything to say.
This farce is over.
I have to get back to serious work.
I have to worry about
the future of our country.
Let's go.
Good bye.
Viewers, we have to end--
Come again?
It's here, in my school book.
Page 23, paragraph four.
<i>How about an example</i>
<i>of something right?</i>
Buddy is our friend.
We had promised Fatka
that we will save Buddy.
Good!
We knew we might not win against you,
but we showed up for Buddy.
Your thugs would've captured Buddy...
if we hadn't helped him.
Fatka, would you
like to say something?
I used to feel bad that unlike
these kids, I would never go to school.
And I wouldn't turn out to be good.
But, I don't feel bad anymore.
Because adults seem to forget
all that they were taught as kids.
So, how does it matter
if one goes to school or not?
The verdict of the battle between the
Minister and the kids is before you.
We will see you next
week with a new issue to discuss.
<i>We will ride on the small fairies</i>
<i>We will fly in the sky today</i>
<i>We will fly</i>
<i>They have labeled us with many tags</i>
<i>We will get rid of them all today</i>
<i>We will fly</i>
<i>Let us look at the world</i>
<i>Through our own eyes</i>
<i>Let us learn something</i>

<i>We want to remind you</i>

Buddy! Buddy!
Buddy! Buddy!

The story focuses on a director, Sharma, whose father owns a sweetshop and wants his son to work there. Sharma, however, wants to become a director, so he leaves for Mumbai to fulfill his dreams. While traveling in the bus, he meets Paddi Singh who notices that his face strongly resembles Osama Bin Laden's. With a new idea in mind, Singh takes him to the film producers called the Shetty Sisters, who offer opportunities to newcomers. After hearing Singh's idea, and particularly upon seeing Paddi, they are impressed.

After the film Tere Bin Laden starring Ali Zafar becomes a blockbuster, Ali embarrasses both Sharma and Paddi. Sharma wants to make the sequel to the film, but Shetty Sisters decide not to help him as Ali wants the sequel to be produced by Karan Johar. This causes a fight between Ali and Sharma. Paddi intervenes and tells the Shetty Sisters that he will do the sequel on the condition it's produced by Sharma with Ali not as the lead actor. Shetty Sisters decide to fire Ali. Everyone involved has doubts and confusion on how can the film will perform without a renowned actor. Once shooting starts, a blunder happens; Osama dies. Thus, shooting stops as they lose confidence in the film. Shetty Sisters continuously demand their money be returned although Sharma has already spent it all. Meanwhile, USA president Obama, who has assassinated Osama, must prove the assassination to the people while lacking proof. They accidentally see Paddi on TV and concoct a plan to record video of his assassination as evidence. David DoSomething disguises himself as David Chadda, visits Paddi and offers him a role in a Hollywood film. Paddi, however, will only do the film on the condition Sharma directs it. Chadda agrees and tells them that the next day their driver will come pick them up.

Elsewhere, we are introduced to Khalili, owner of a terrorist organization and a business of selling guns and bombs. Due to financial crunches, the quality of the equipment is poor and causes his people to rebel. He amends the situation by promising free food and a film of Osama's adventures. During this film, a scene appears of Paddi and Khalili being informed that Osama is dead. Khalili plans to bring Paddi and have him reassure his people that he is the best supplier of bombing equipment and guns. He then orders his men to kidnap the cast of TBL. Their first target is Ali Zafar, but they fail to abduct him due to his ""Six Pack Abs"". Changing course, they set on kidnapping Paddi.

Khalili's men arrive before the driver sent by David picks them up. Sharma and Paddi, under the impression this was the driver sent by David, enters the car and is unknowingly kidnapped by Khalili's men.

When Chada learns of these circumstances, he travels to Khalili's place and rescues the cast of Tere bin Ladin. Chada now wants to capture a video portraying Osama (Paddi) being shot by the American army. When Sharma becomes aware of Chada's efforts, he makes a deal with him and Khalili. Chadda pays Khalili the money he's demanded while Sharma creates a ""proof movie"" in which Osama (Paddi) is shot by Obama. Obama then assures Sharma he can ask for any favors. Sharma says, ""One Hollywood movie"". In the end, that movie is shown to be Tora Bora Nights.",3267,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt5313980.srt","<b>Fixed & Synced by bozxphd.Enjoy The Flick</b>

- Pardon?
- Sir!
Sir!
Get me down!
Paddi. We are screwed!
What?
Sequel can't be made.
Speak loudly! Why have you
made me Superman!
I'm sure Ali cursed us!
Stop swinging me!
Stop dry humping the air Paddi!
Sequel is dead!
Osama is DEAD!
Breaking news..
Osama Bin Laden is dead!
The face that terrorized
the whole world..
Has been sprayed with
American bullets!
Now the only question standing.
What will happen.
Without you Bin Laden?
Yes!
You heard it right!
Osama is DEAD!
DEAD!
DEAD!
DEAD!
DEAD!
DEAD!
DEAD!
Love struck like a hurricane.
Shook the world and gave it pain!
Love struck like a hurricane.
Shook the world and gave it pain!
Proof?
DEAD!
Pressure is mounting on America
to prove that Osama is dead!
The world wants to see the video
where Osama was killed!
Sir.. Listen to me!
What are you doing Paddi?
Sir!
Osama is dead in the sea!
And the sequel is dead in the rubble!
Trust me! Trying to chase
stardom is stupid!
Anyway...
You just clear my accounts and
off I go to my village!
Paddi! Why are the accounts
coming up?
I am the director of a hit film!
I will not give up so easily.
Once this Osama's death dies out.
Producers will be
calling me non-stop!
- Really!
- Obviously!
Holy Milk of a cow.. It's ringing!
Pick it up.. And put it on speaker!
Hello..
Sharma.
L-low does it feel to have your
self respect tarnished?
L-low dare you chuck me off
the film, you piece of crap!
I hope you realize how unworthy
your existence is.
Oh Yes!
Ask your tone deaf villager
to put his head between
between his legs and
run back to his farm!
ShitWit!
Sir..
Sir.. Sir..
No! Don't jump! Don't!
Stop overacting Paddi!
Might hurt your tender knees.
I have to turn the game now..
I'll return in a bit!
Can you get some Broccoli
on the way back?
Buzz off!
Harkat-e-Mansha shut down!
Harkat-e-Mansha shut down!
Shame on you Khaleeli!
Your bombs and arms are all dud!
No point of Terrorism without blood!
Quiet!
- For the sake of terrorism.
- Listen to me please!
Why should we listen?
Your suicide bombers are
not bursting properly!
Instead they turn into
a fireworks display!
Look at him..
Burning like a candle in the wind!
We signed up to be blown into
martyrdom. But in vain!
Now compensate!
We need compensation!
We need compensation. Compensation!
After the death of Osama.
The cost of arms and ammunition
has gone up ten folds..
So we are using gun powder of
one grenade into three!
That's why you are not
attaining heaven..
Let me assure you that we are a
passionate terrorist group!
Give us one last chance!
Tonight we have a special screening of
some great tapes of Osama bin Laden.
Also, we are serving
dinner and drinks.
So kindly join us for
an Osama Retrospective
and make peace with our great loss!
Did you give our gifts?
No! They almost shoved
it up my butt!
No one is ready to accept our arms!
No sweat! Atleast they are here..
Now you see, how Osama's face
gets us a rain of donations!
Hey hottie!
Do you wanna get lucky tonight?
It's a scandal!
It's fake! Burn it down!
What happened Sir?
You didn't like it?
I swear!
I made a big mistake!
My son added a cheap Bollywood
film to the Osama tapes.
But what to do Sir!
This clown has an uncanny
resemblance to Osama.
It could fool anyone!
Stop!
Get all these jokers here!
We need to send a
message to the world..
Osama is still.. A LIVE.

farm to buy this house!
Now if you sell the house..
Where will we go?
You don't get it..

L-low will I complete my film'?
And how will I make you a star?

Join your legs! It's peeping again!
Congratulations! Sign the contract.

Should be my mentor. Mr. Sharma!
Mr. Chadha.
Only he can take care of me and make
me look and act like Osama!
Don't say no Mr. Chadha.
I beg of you!
Sir, he looks like a country man.
Only Sharma can make
him look like the real Osama.
We'll dispose them both after the op!
Done deal!

My daddy says.
What's the point
of having such muscles.
I said, I have valour in
my heart and fire in the belly..
So the world says wow..

It's ringing!
Hi this is Ali, The Star!

I'll get you picked.
And if you are a man! Speak fast or

You are the unworthy one!
Bloody Bollywood clown!
Speak up you knuckle head!
Cat bit your tongue or what?
Paddi. The phone is disconnected!
Call him again!
I wanna abuse his sister!
I think these guys are here..
But they are an hour early?
It's Hollywood Paddi.
Pack the bags quick!
According to the
plan..You go upstairs.
Ring the bell.. Ting Tong!
That clown will come out.
I will put a blanket on him and
close the door behind!
Khaleeli Sir ordered.
For you to ring the bell twice.
Ting Tong!!
The man might be sleeping..
As he comes out, I will put
a blanket on him..
And then bash him!
No.. No.. You will ring the bell!
That clown will come out.
Bulla try and understand!
No! That is not Khaleeli Sir's order!
What a rainbow colored van!
Osama!
Osama!
Paddi, they are big fans of yours!
I'm blushing!
Come on let's go!
You will also pile on?
Idiot!
Start driving.
Your boss knows all about it.
You missed the left to the airport!
We are going by road..
And switch off your phones!
Why?
Paddi quiet! It's Hollywood..
Look at the detailing!
Even the drivers are in costumes..
That's why I love Hollywood!
Sing in the right pitch Sir!
Stop it!
Please. Music is a sin.
Relax dude! It's gibberish...
What a dimwit. You keep singing!
Trace their phones..
Sir.. I am driving. Vroom!
Mr. David!
We love you!

Your guys are also enjoying..
Wait I'll show you

Switch off the camera.
Switch off the camera.
Where did they go?
Ah... Very good..
The midget can walk.
And the eyes are intense!
You don't get it.. Do you?!
You threw my iPhone?
This is no way to treat a Director!
I'll tell Mr. David.
I'll complain to
our Directors' union..
Saale khacchar!
Screw Hollywood!
I have lost my butt cheeks!
Paddi.
Don't be fussy..
This is our last chance...
If we don't do this right.

Why are we talking in sign language?
Give me that thing..
Don't you know this

Now listen Barbie.
I want this clown to look like
Osama in 30 minutes!
And you owl eyes.. Write in arabic..
Write that 'l, Osama, am Alive and in
good care of my dear friend Khaleeli'
But I don't know
how to write in Arabic.
Can you write in Arabic?
Yes!
I have proof..
Owl eyes will write Arabic.
Barbie will do his make up..
And you.. Weirdo!
Will mimic Osama's voice..
Yes Sir! I am a mimicry artist!
L.. Khaleeli loves Osama!
Please Uncle.. We will do it!
Chirag just write anything!
Mona where is Osama?
In America!
It's done!
Is he Osama or Santa Claus?
Disgusting!
You read what you have written!
Osama sounds like a choo choo train!
What kind of Arabic is this?
It's Arabic, Sir..
Weirdo here can't read it..
Rahul please read only Arabic.
It's not Arabic!
This ass has written gibberish!
It's Arabic!
Don't lie, you have written gibberish.
Shut up!
Daaga. Shoot them all..
Daaga.
Uncle, we are just actors.
Without a Director.. We are clueless!
What is a Director?
Nice..
In fact good..
Good depth.
But what do you wanna shoot here?
You..
Bulla. What are you saying?
It's Khaleeli Sir's order!
Why did you pile on?
I asked you in the van also.
Didn't I?
Go right.
Now go left.. Right. Perfect!
Bulla listen to me..
Let's run away!
Sorry?
Bollywood!
If I can transform
Paddi into 'The Paddi'..
I can make you 'Tha Bulla' in no time!
Bulla.
Bulla stop!
Bulla stop!
Come on!
Khaleeli wants you..
Why?
To resurrect Osama!
And cut it!
Here.. Your tape is ready.
Brilliant Sharma!
I can't thank you enough for this..
Come on Khaleeli Sir..
I am a Director..
Can't say no to a film..
Films run in your family it seems.
Can you not get into
my family affairs?
Mind your tape business!
Don't be upset!
Tell me..
What is Osama saying in this tape?
Osama?
Osama said..
'I am Alive'.
And..
'I am with Khaleeli Sir'
He likes you!
And..
'I beg for some donations in
the name of almighty'
Right!
OK.. Bulla. No.. Daaga. Check
it once and keep it in the locker.
Khaleeli Sir..
Now that your work is done..
And the tape has also come out well..
I was thinking what
if we leave for India?
Paddi. Come on boy!
Uncle! This time don't
send us tied in sacks.
Fight or train would also do..
Right boys?
Daaga is so cute..
Come on Boys.. Bye Sir!
Sharma!
Come to daddy.. Come to daddy..
Look Sharma, America will definitely
reply to this tape.
Then we'll need to reply
with another tape.
Then they will reply..
And we will reply..
This replying game will go on forever!
So now you are our guests.
Pop some opium.
And keep making tapes!
Listen my bearded twin..
Spare me!
I will never become Osama again.
I'll go back to my village.
I beg you Khaleeli Sir!
Sir.. Atleast clear my account now!
Paddi. Atleast see the situation!
- But it's been three years!
- Buzz off!
You haven't paid me a dime!
Mr. Chadha!
Mr. Chadha!
Americans!
Take position and fire!
Till death blows us apart!
Run!
Paddi, run!
Sir!
Mr. David!
Mr. David!
Sir!
Mr. David. I knew it!
Only Hollywood can save Bollywood!
Thank me later.
But tell me..
What were these morons up to?
They forced us to make
a fake tape of Osama!
Bloody idiots!
Hop in!
What's that?
Hollywood!
Go there.. Go there..
Hey you.. American eagle!
Give my tape. shoot him!
Gimme the tape. Throw it!
Osama!
Ah...
Thank you Mr. David. Thank you..
Thank me later!
Guys meet Mr. David Chadha
producer from Hollywood!
Hollywood?
Yes.
He is making a Hollywood
film 'Tora Bora Nights'..
I am the star of the film!
And Sir is directing it!
Live to die!
A Hollywood producer with US marines?
What a funny guy..
Still cracking a joke!
So what I was saying friends. Sharma
and Paddi have a shoot to finish..
And our location.
Somewhere in.. Somewhere.
Is also on the way!
So why don't we wrap up our shoot.
And then drop you back home? OK.
OK, my Ass!
Rahul Singh doesn't attend
someone else's shoot!
Chadha Uncle.. We just escaped death!
Please send us home!
My cat is also alone in the house..
OK.. OK.. Guys!
You can also be part of this film!
Really!
Sharma!
There is no role for them!
Mr. David..
They are Bollywood wannabes!
For a minute in Hollywood, they
will make noise for one year!
Guys! Welcome to Hollywood!
Love struck like a hurricane.
Shook the world and gave it pain.
Love struck like..
Paddi, careful! Chopper bladesl!
What are you staring at?
It's your house! Come!
Sharma come!
See that!
Be careful of snakes!
And. This is it!
A wall!
Where is Hollywood?
Oh.. One minute!
Mr. Chadha
I'll also drink some water.
I am parched!
It's not coming out?!
Come on..
Welcome to Somewhere in Somewhere!
WOW!
It looks right out of a Fairy Tale!
Isn't it fantastic?!
This is our Abottabad set..
Osama's House!
What say Mr. Paddi.
My Star!
Why are you standing?
Why don't you sit down.
Sharma.
Look..
Osama's bedroom.
Isn't it nice?
Very real Mr. David!
Chadha uncle..
Very nice..
Thank you!
Mr. David. Could we get a script?
Mr. Chirag.
There is no script to this film..
Because it's based on real reality!
So Sharma!
What was I saying?
The scene goes like this.
Osama is sleeping in his bedroom.
He is sleeping!
Suddenly we see American
chopper approaching.
US marines climb out of it.
And barge into Osama's bedroom.
Bam! Bam! Bam!
Osama's dead!
Then they will wrap up his dead body..
They will put him in the chopper..
Fly away.
And throw him in the Sea.
Black out.
OK.
OK, my Ass!
What is Rahul Singh's role?
Uncle what is the
motivation of this scene?
Mr. David.
Let me..
Sugandha.
You will be Osama's wife!
Rustic!
Very good..
Osama can't be alone!
So the two of you..
Will be his bodyguards!
You want ME to be a bodyguard?
No I mean Mujahideen!
You will fight with the US marines!
That's a brilliant idea, Sir!
They'll all be disposed
off in one shot.
Sharma.
Am I just sleeping?
What if him and I have some action?
Very good!
Where were you all this while..
Mr. David.
Involvement!
Very good idea!
Before the Marines barge in..
Let's show some romance
between Osama and his wife.
What say Paddi?
No Sharma!
I am not making a film!
I mean, it's not that kind of a film!
Mr. David listen to me..
Sit down.
Mr. David we will
shoot it aesthetically.
No vulgarity!
Sex scene for us is
like honey for the bees.
More the sex. Bigger the audience!
- Really?
- No..
No.. I can't allow..
Chadha uncle!
Sorry to cut your off..
I wanna do..
Do?
Do what?
Mr. David imagine!
It's raining outside.
Thunder!
Cut to! The American chopper
is approaching the target.
It is a silent chopper..
Silent? No problem.
Cut to!
Two Mujahideen are
guarding the house..
Everybody Stay Alert!
Everybody Stay Alert!
Echo effect!
Cut to! Osama is walking in his room..
He is restless.. Sleep deprived.
He is very lonely within..
Lonely effect!
He wants something.
Then suddenly his newly wedded wife
walks in with a glass of milk..
Osama sees her and utters.
I love Milk!
Paddi. Please. Don't disturb!
Osama whispers to his wife..
'Sugarcrush.
'I have a very empty feeling inside,
please fill me up'..
Cut to..
US marines are loading their guns..
Cut back!
Osama's wife embraces him..
And kisses his forehead.
Cut back!
The American chopper enters the house!
Mujahideen start firing at them!
Gun fight! Mr. David. Gun fight!
Inside it is Valentine's!
And outside.. Halloween!
Just then! The Marines barge into
Osama's bedroom.
BAM!
BAM! BAM!
In a matter of seconds..
Osama's wife is a WIDOW!
- Widow!
- Black out!
Brilliant!
Make it Sharma. Make it!
Oscar shot!
Oscar shot By God!
What a director.
What a director!
But sir..
Junior, get the shot ready.
And I'll have a hot dog..
You swine! What is he saying?
Khaleeli Sir, he said..
Harkat-E-Mansha is an army of Donkeys!
Sick bastards!
Hold it Daaga!
To fight the Americans.
We need help from these Afghans.
Bulla. Tell these guys that Osama is
alive and we know where to find him..
Sir, he just ordered death upon us
for making fun of Osama!
Khaleeli Sir..
They have agreed
to fight the Americans.
But under one condition.
Daaga has to be left behind!
They believe that a person
without a mustache or a beard
cannot be a mujahideen!
Lights. Camera. Rain!
Sir, it wasn't raining
when we killed Osama.
It's Cinematic Liberty!
But we're not making a movie..
And action!
This burning thing is called fire..
Come on boys.. Give me a perfect shot!
And once it's out. It will be ash.
How intriguing!!
Abu Baker! Helicopter!
We will not die today! 'Cause today
is our Independence Day!
Hare Krishna! Save me!
Cut it!
Chirag?
What the hell are you doing, Chirag?
What happened?
Why are you shouting
as if someone is raping you?
Take the chopper back.
What happened Sir?
Sharma. This gun is real!
One bullet nicked my ear..
It's red!
Chirag, everything is fake here!
Wait, I am coming!
Come fast!
Here I come!
Chirag. You are one big pussy!
This gun is all plastic.
Watch this!
Nothing happened!
See.. Nothing happened!
What happened?
Bob..
Sgt. Bob..
Come on Sgt. Bob!
Enough with the jokes.
Now get up and show everybody
that you are OK!
He scared the hell out of us.
Good actor..
Back to positions now!
Sharma. ls my make up OK?
Yeah it's OK..
Chirag, happy'?
Back to positions!
Hare Krishna!
And Action!
Come on boys, let's go for it..
Abu Baker! Helicopter!
Come on American dogs!
I'll kill everyone of you and
bury you in Afghanistan!
- Cut it!
- I'll kill everyone of you..
- Cut it!
- To hell with you..
I said.. Cut!!
What?
Cut it! God damn it!
What happened?
I was so absorbed in the shot.
Absorbed, my ass!
What happened, Sir?
Sir, we're wasting time.
Thanks for that
ridiculous performance.
You look like a chimp..
Stop acting like one!
Pack up!
Pack up!
Sugandha baby..
Is it the dinner break?
- What do you mean by pack up?
- Sharma what's wrong?
Mr. David pack him off!
I'll make Chirag do the action scene!
Go fight like Chuck Norris!
Sharma. Wait!
Let me speak to RahuL.
Sir, is it a pack up or not?
Paddi. Keep shut for a while!
Sharma.
Sharma.
We are wasting a lot of time.
Why don't we kill Paddi first?
I mean.
Shoot the Osama killing first!
Good idea.
Location change.
Let's do the bedroom scene first!
Our love scene is next, handsome!
Daaga. My DOV!
Please don't cry..
I am gifting you my suicide jacket.
If you ever miss me..
Say my name and..
Have a blast!
As soon as you enter, kill Paddi the
same way that was told to the media.
One on the chest. One on the head!
All set, Sir!
Ready everybody.. And.. Action!
Cut it.
Paddi come on..
One more..
Take 8!
And Action!
I love Milk!
No No..
Cut it!
Paddi come on.. Emotions!
OK.. Ready.
Take 21!
Action!
Action!
I love Milk!
Cut it!
Hollywood.. Feel it!
Action!
Very good!
- I love Milk!
- Cut it!
Take 69..
Action!
Sharma. Get it right this time!
Osama.
Cut it!
What happened?
One more Paddi.
What one more!
What the.
I love Milk! I love Milk! I love Milk!
Why don't you bloody die!
Why are you driving me crazy..
You sick bastard!
Who made you an actor?
I wanna put this gun in your mouth
and blast your brains out!
Pack up.. Pack up..
Buzz off!
How dare you!
Why did you shout at my star?
Screw Hollywood!
And who do you think you're
scaring with a toy gun?
Should I shoot you?!
Sharma. Please return my gun..
I got emotional.
But he is not dying!
We can't shoot now..
But why?
Mr. David.
Sugandha's aggression has already
made him wet his pants.
And you shoved death in his mouth!
Let him catch his breath!
We need to relieve his tension!
Don't worry Sharma.
I will ease him out!
Mr. David that's what I call
involvement.
Mr. David.
In the meantime.
Let's call for a break!
I will have a hot dog!
What?
So Paddi.
How do you wanna do this?
Sugandha Baby.
Bushes!
In the village.
That's where boys pop their cherry!
So earthy.
Interesting. Come on..
Come!
Bro.. This is Hollywood!
I don't need 5 pounds of acting.
5 ounces will do..
Keep it subtle.
5 ounces?
I'm an actor. Not a piece of meat!
And keep your attitude in check.
After all Rahul Singh
is the star of your film!
Of course!
Give me a high five..
RahuL. Sharma.
What?
There is no craft service!
So?
But Sharma.
Be it Hollywood or Bollywood..
Break implies Craft Service!
Something is not right.
Give it a thought.
There is no script nor a crew..
Only that Ape David Chadha,
and his Marines!
What do you make of all this?
Oh yes.. It is!
Paddi.
Now don't be shy!
It's just my first
time so..
Let's make it mechanical.
You close your eyes..
Walk towards me.. And just kiss me!
That sounds good!
So here I come Sugandha Baby.
Yes. Paddi come..
Come to me!
I'm coming Sugandha Baby!
I am coming.. Sugandha Baby!
Come Paddi come!
Say my name!
Sugandha Baby.
You are freezing!
The cold has made you so stiff!
Sugandha baby..
I finally feel like a Man!
Paddi.
That's a man!
Sir! Sir!
Can you stop crying like a girl?!
Let me think.
I said it in the chopper..
Let's go back to India!
But all of you laughed at me!
I am amazed,
we weren't suspicious at all!
How were we fooled so easily?
We were not fooled.. But tricked.
By this Sharma!
He lured us into this Hollywood trap!
Why are you blaming me?
I have been tricked by Paddi!
What?
I tricked you?
Who else!
I was innocently making
coffee in the kitchen,
he selfishly tricked
me into Hollywood..
I wasn't even interested!
What the hell are you saying.
Uh.. Sir!
Who made me Osama?
Who sold my farms?
Who made me a method actor?
Who cooked up the myth of 'Paddi,
The Star'?
It's my fault that I tried to
make a star out of a country bumpkin!
Really!
As if you are the heir
to the British Throne!
'Sweet - Maker Sharma!'
Have you forgotten.
The sweat drenching
experience of sweet making!
Sharma senior still sells Churros.
Crooning Ten Bucks for Two!
Ten bucks for two!
What?
Now Churro makers
are becoming film makers!
Hare Krishna!
Hello friends!
We have to shoot immediately.
Where is Sharma?
Sir?!
Sir? You are frying Churros?
Guys! Give me some
alone time with my buddy.
Paddi.
These are not just Churros.
This is my inborn talent!
A talent I never appreciated!
But today, after you blurted it out.
I have finally made
peace with my reality!
Now you watch!
Before I die, I'll make
such amazing Churros.
That people will forget my film!
Sir..
Please forgive me..
I have made a grave mistake!
I have screwed up my mentor!
And driven him crazy!
Paddi!
Don't feel bad..
Here.. I will not let you die hungry!
Sir.. I have lost my appetite!
Sir, it's delicious.
What's the ingredient?
Paddi, emotion.
Sir, they are ready to shoot now..
The moment you say Action.
First these scumbags
will terminate me..
And then you!
I don't wanna get massacred by them..
I'd rather have you kill me!
Right Sir! You shoot me!
I beg of you.. Shoot me!
Paddi!
That's a brilliant idea!
You've saved all of us!
Wow Sharma!
These are amazing!
By the way..
What were you saying that
the Marines don't work?
Mr. David, these American
actors are very realistic.
And Bollywood actors are melodramatic!
It's a terrible combination.
It's like eating Chicken
Burger with Chicken Curry!
That's why the shoot is suffering..
Look at them. Such realistic
emotions.. Very innocent!
Very real!
And look at them. Fake!
But what's the point?
Trust me..
Let us Indians play the
Marines.
It will balance it out!
Meaning?
Chirag, Rahul and l..
Will dress up like Marines and
enter Osama's room..
They will shoot!
While I candidly
capture Osama's death.
Guerilla style!
Sharma! These Marines are Americans!
Not to sound racist but.
Your colours won't match.
Oh c'mon Mr. David!
The Marines are wearing helmets.
You can barely see their faces...
As it is, if you decide to swap
Sgt. Bob with Sgt. Jack.
There's no way we'd know, right?
No.. No.. Of course not!
Should I take this shot?
One take and Osama dead!
Alright!
"" No!""
No.. Oh no.. I can't
allow!
One take. One take.
He'll be done in one take.
Mr. David! Gulp it
down and let's just do it!
OK! Take your shot!
Junior.
I need the uniforms..
Strip the Marines!
Junior! Once we get the shot.
Dispose them all!
That was the plan!
And.. Action!
Listen my Starsky and Hutch!
Spray the bullets on the wall..
Don't make their plan a success
by shooting Paddi!
Chill!
Relax Paddi! All will be good!
Sugandha baby..
I'm really scared
of Rahul and Chirag.
Their overacting
will definitely kill me!
Sugandha baby?
I love your rustic charm!
Paddi. Die!
Sucker is dead!
Stop overacting Sugandha.
He is Dead. He is Dead.
Osama is finally dead!
Sir!
Sir!
There's no blood on Osama!
See.. No blood!
Never mind!
We will just take a separate
shot of the dead body..
Come on.. Call the chopper back.
Give me some Churros!
Base to Mute. Return with feedback!
I repeat.. Return with feedback.
Hey Junior! I'll have a hot dog.
What?
Put David on the line please.
Sir! Sharma!
- Sharma?
- Yes!
Yes Sharma?
Mr. David focus! Your Osama
flew over the CUCKOO'S nest!
Screw you hairball!
We are off to India. While you
suck on those Churros!
You son of a bitch!
Screw you on a bed of nails!
What happened? Speak up you Asswipe!
Paddi. It got disconnected!
Call him back.
I wanna abuse Junior now!
Junior! Get the chopper out. Fast!
Khaleeli Sir.. Helicopter!
Paddi. ls your face alright?
Sir.. My hand!
I don't care even if you lose your
hand. Just take care of your face!
Paddi. Hands up!
Sheikh Osama!
What's going on?
Welcome my clown!
Listen to me, you clown!
Everyone here thinks
you are the real Osama.
And if they find out
you are an imposter.
They will cut you into pieces!
So come to daddy..
Come to daddy!
Paddi, don't go!
Paddi!
Paddi!
Paddi!
What are you doing?
No.. No.. He is an imposter.
Bulla, you swine!
Tell them that he is an imposter!
My Star!
So absorbed in his character!
Listen to me you imbeciles!
It is a sin to kill
a fellow Mujahideen.
Paddi! Duck!

Bit embarrassing, Sir!
Shit happens! Here, try once more!
Paddi stop. Let me handle this!
Mr. David! Khaleeli Sir!

We need.. Donation!
How much donation?

Mr. David.
Why do you want to kill Paddi?
What's your deal?
I have an idea!
I'll get you a proof..

One simple demand Mr. President.
One Hollywood film!
Breaking News!

the tape of the Osama killing!
America wanted their proof, and
America got their proof..
I took out Osama Bin Laden myself,
with my own hands.
I'm a brave leader and that's why
I'm your President!
That's why you gave me a second term.
And that's why this is a sequel!
Now, a renowned Hollywood
producer has announced.
That he will make a
film based on this story!
The name of the film
is Tora Bora Nights!
Sir.. Shall we?
Can you tell us more about the
actor in your movie?
He is not an actor. He is a STAR!
You can only see my eyes in the film..
But I'm a trained actor.
For every second...
One expression, you know!
I am playing an extra in this film!
It's a 10 second role!
A blink and a miss!
It's a sequel for
me to be Osama's voice!
And the world knows that only
Rahul Singh can do it!
Tora Bora Nights!
It's a family entertainer!
Is there any song and dance?
Song and Dance?
No.. It's a Hollywood film..
No vulgarity!
I can't allow!
Khaleeli Sir!
Daaga. I got it!
I got the money, Daaga!
Now we will attain Heaven!
Uh.. Oh!

Three Pakistani youth throw packets of drugs across the border to India for it to be picked up later. Tejinder ""Tommy"" Singh, better known as ""Gabru"" among his fans, is a young and successful Punjabi musician who lives a luxurious lifestyle. Together with an ostentatious crew led by his uncle Tayaji and cousin Jassi, he routinely indulges in cocaine consumption. Tommy is popular for his energetic songs with lyrics that often glorify violence and drug addiction. However, his addiction costs him his music contract and lands him in jail. While in prison, he meets two of his die-hard fans who remark how Tommy's lifestyle had 'inspired' theirs, leading them to murder their own mother for drug money. Realizing that his songs have negatively affected teenagers, Tommy decides to change his ways upon release. A few days later, he engages in an altercation and inadvertently shoots Tayaji, injuring his ear. This causes Tayaji to send Tommy and his crew away to a farmhouse so that he can prepare for an upcoming concert.

Working on the farm is a migrant worker from Bihar nicknamed Bauria, whose dreams of playing national-level hockey for the country were shattered due to her father's death, pushing her to Punjab to work as a laborer. She works for a local landlord who uses agriculture as a front for drug-peddling. One night, she finds a suspicious packet on the farm and realizes that it is some kind of a drug. She resolves to sell it but her search for a potential buyer lands her in trouble as she unwittingly contacts the original owners of the heroin. She is captured by the gang of drug peddlers but not before she discards it into a well. As a compensation for their lost drugs, the peddlers forcibly keep her at their house, where she is sexually and physically abused, given drugs, and pimped to men. Some weeks later, she manages to escape.

Over in the neighboring town lives Preet Sahni, a doctor and activist who runs a rehabilitation center. Sartaj Singh is a junior policeman who knows about the drug smuggling his seniors are allowing on a large scale. But when it affects his family, as his brother, Balli, overdoses and is brought to Preet's clinic, he realizes the grave situation. Preet and Sartaj decide to find the root cause of the problem together. Balli is admitted into her drug rehabilitation centre against his will.

At his concert, instead of singing, Tommy starts preaching. Infuriated by his speech about how one should lead one's life, his fans start throwing bottles at him. The angered Tommy urinates in front of the crowd before fleeing. He hides in an old structure and meets Bauria, also hiding. The two share their stories and bond. However, Bauria is recaptured by the same gang when she defends Tommy from being attacked by them. He learns the next day that an arrest warrant has been issued for him because of the public ruckus at the concert, and sets out to find Bauria after realising his feelings for her.

Preet and Sartaj find that the driving force behind the drug problem in Punjab is an elderly man called Virender Singh, who has flourished with the support of his father-in-law, MP Maninder Brar. The two go to extreme measures to collect evidence against the politician and put together a report to be sent to the state's Election Commission to thwart Brar's campaign for another term in power. Sartaj and Preet fall in love; however, one night, Preet sees a manic Balli trying to escape from her rehab center. On trying to stop him, she is accidentally stabbed in the neck by him. As Balli is Sartaj's brother, senior officer Jhujar Singh who investigates the homicide decides to send him underground. While falsifying the crime scene he comes across the report made by her and Sartaj, and is infuriated when he sees that he too has been named in the drug racket. He calls Sartaj and knocks him out when he arrives.

Waking up in the presence of the local drug mafia at their farmhouse, where Bauria is also confined, a bruised and beaten Sartaj is questioned by Jhujar, who is a key member in the drug racket. Sartaj says whatever he did was for the sake of Punjab. At the same time, Tommy enters the house, armed with a hockey stick. Taking advantage of the distraction, Sartaj grabs Jhujar's gun and shoots the whole gang before freeing Balli. Tommy helps Bauria escape from her captors. Balli kneels and cries in front of his brother, whose face is expressionless.

Eventually, it is shown that the government issued an inquiry into Brar's activities and there has been a huge crackdown on the drug menace. Over in Goa, amidst his crew members, Tommy calls Bauria to ask for her real name. Sitting by the beach, she catches sight of a foreigner having fun. Inspired, she says ""Mary Jane"", to which Tommy flirtatiously replies that she is his ""life"", and she ends the call before going for a swim.[a]",5082,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt4434004.srt","Take out the packet.

<i>Green revolution,</i> part <i>two.</i>
But what about our progress?
Our cut is still the same.
Fucking 10,000 rupees!
Can <i>we</i> get anything in 10,000?
- No.
I think they've taken
the Punjab police for granted.
There's no regard
for law and order here.
If this continues,
Punjab will become Mexico.
Sister fucker, you will turn Punjab into Mexico?
- No, sir.
I will not, sir!
I feel he surely will.
No, sir. I will not
turn it to a Mexico. Never!
Tell your boss to up
our commission.
It's a red light here!
No green light.
Yes, sir.
- Fuck off!
Make it quick... move!
See... cop power?
Yes.
Who is calling?
Yes, sir.
<i>I'll</i> be there... right away.
Go to hell!

I am not lying. I swear on you.
What happened?
Gracing us with your presence at <i>3</i> am?
Is there a problem?
Get some tea and cookies.
We've got guests.
No need for that.
We have orders from the top.
Get Tommy here. Or all these
sister fuckers will gets arrested.
Tommy?
He left for London yesterday.
Who's the GABRU?
I'm the GABRU.
What?
I didn't hear that.
I'm the GABRU.
Haven't you eaten?
I'm the GABRU.
I still can't hear you.
I'm the GABRU.
Didn't Tommy go to London?
So apparently he is here.
But he has given up cocaine.
Doesn't even touch it.
Listen up sister fuckers!
I am the fucking GABRU!
Tommy Singh's arrest is
the latest development...
in the drug crisis that has been
plaguing Punjab for the last few years...
And we have with us eminent politician
MP - Mr. Maninder Brar
Instead of taking concrete
steps to tackle the drug menace...
Why is the government going
for soft targets like Tommy Singh.
People like Tommy Singh -
they are the ones who are encouraging
drug addiction in our society
with their music,
with their choice of lifestyle.
Look at the kind of videos
they are making.
I think the youth of Punjab deserves
a better role model than Tommy Singh.
Bloody phoney!
- The milk's come to a boil.
Turn off the stove!
- Please understand this.
Breakfast!
Drop Balli off to college.
He's still asleep.
Good morning to you also!
Phagwara's boy transformed from
Punjab's Gabru to a menace to society.
Greetings.
Greetings, son. You ready?
Good morning, grandma.
Bless you, son.
I am very worried about Balli.
He wears sunglasses even at home.
Even at home?
- Doesn't study at all.
Let me talk to him.
Balli!
Balli!
Balli!
Get ready.
Aren't you late for college?
And remove this idiot's poster.
With your precious vote,
make Rajveer Singh Pehlwan win.
His victory is yours as well.
Please vote for him!
Vote for Rajveer Singh!
Listen...
Come here...
Need money?
If I find you at a coffee shop,
<i>l'll</i> thrash you.
Thank you!
Yeah, I'm on my way.
I""m getting it.
Give me two today.
Faster.
Greetings.
Greetings. How are you?
Why? You took very long.
You know, Punjab roads are a mess.
Here's the stuff you asked for.
This one is white
and this is the pink stuff.
This one is for five grand
and this is for 10.
This one is very good as well.
Try it once
and you'll surely ask for more!
What are you doing here?
My stomach is hurting.
I need to go to the doctor.
Get back by 12 o'clock.
Or <i>I'll</i> cut your entire day's pay.
Run along.
There's a shortage.
Check the stuff.
That soap. The red one.
The one on top?
There used to be a huge crowd
at the tea stall earlier.
Who drinks tea these days?
They are all drugged out at the ruins.
Did you see Tommy's pose?
Take that, yo, sister fucker!
His brother caught Tommy.
Did-k!
Idiot!
Don't take it to heart, my love.
Who are you?
What are you looking at?
Do you want stuff?
What do you have?
Powder.
Heroin?
What?
- Heroin?
Yes. That. Heroin.
I don't have any money. Ask them.
You ask them. And take a commission.
How much?
How much can you offer?
3000 is the going rate.
How much do you have?
Three.
Come tomorrow.
<i>I'll</i> have it arranged.
Full three grams, right?
Kilos!
Three kilos!
Where did you get that much stuff?
Do you really want it?
Or should I leave?
Nobody can buy it here.
There is someone in town.
Raja, he is...
Give me his mobile...
Number...
9988... I will take 10 percent.
What?
- 10 percent. 10!
No. Five percent.
Alright)!-
He's back.
Brother of a cop!
Again... already?
Easy, bro!
Give it an hour at least.
Get lost.
Don't act like a roadie, bro!
Balli...! Balli...!
Give me the blood pressure set. Hurry!
Is that what you do in college?
Balli?
Doctor...
Is he going to make it?
Wait outside.
The doctor is coming. Please.
So call the doctor. Who is the doctor?
Please wait outside.
- Balli...
Inform the traffic police.
Turn him on his side.
How many times should I tell you?
Open your eyes, kiddo.
Show me the readings.
Get the IV line started.
Prepare a Naloxone injection.
Double dose.
Madam...
Will he be okay?
Please wait outside.
Please wait outside. Please.
If you have any sort of addiction -
alcohol or drugs
- you just let us know.
We will get you off any addiction.
Cough syrup, smack or heroin...
we have a solution...
You can have it
Give it to your mate
To your family.
We will cure everyone.
Madam, thank you.
What did he have? Heroin?
Hard to say right now.
But he's been doing it for a while.
Heavy dosage.
No, madam.
The boys must have forced him.
My Balli isn't the kind.
Have you seen his hands?
His veins are turning blue,
thanks to the needles.
""My boy is not like that,
it's the others!""
Madam...
Madam...
Sorry, madam. I had no idea.
I was just checking, madam...
Will he be able to give it up?
It is up to him.
And his environment.
At such high dependence,
a person loses comprehension.
He is my younger brother.
Dad left me to raise him.
After he's discharged,
bring him to my clinic.
Maqbool road,
opposite Rajju's mansion.
We'll do our best.
Okay?
Hello.
Stuff... Do you want stuff?
Wrong number.
- Three kilos of heroin.
I will not call again.
How much?
Three thousand.
Write down the address.
Just a second.
Birdbrain!
One, ten, hundred, thousand...
ten thousand!
Is anyone there?
Please let me talk to Mr. Brar.
Maninder Brar, MP
I performed at his daughter's wedding.
I am Tommy Singh.
Let me talk to him.
Let me talk to him.
At least give me water.
I should at least get water,
sister fuckers!
This is wrong, sister fuckers!
It's 'human rights', sister fuckers!
Give me water right now!
Give me water!
What happened?
<i>You want to go home'?</i>
Go then.
The bail can happen later, sir.
You're a celebrity, after all. VIP!
Kartar, take out the jeep.
We have to drop sir back home.
This way, sir.
Sister fucker, so you are the GABRU?
Sister fucker,
you're spoiling the youth.
You fucker!
You are the GABRU, right?
Become a man first, then a VIP.
Loser!

We were in the 8th grade
when your first song released.
We are your fans since.
We want to be like you.
The GABRU!
The first time I injected myself,
I swear,
all I could see was your face!
Mother fuckers!
You've killed your mother.
And now you sing songs here?
Aren't you ashamed!
She was not giving us money.
We needed to have our fix.
What else could we do.

I think she is the same girl...
Faster!
Bro, why is she running
into the fields?
Kuku, stop her, sister fucker!
What is she doing?
Yes, sir.
- Run... run!
Ruining our stuff, bitch!
Here you go, Jackie Chan.
Greetings.
Greetings to you too.
Will you have some buttermilk?
Greetings.
Bhandi at your service, sir!
Look at me!
She is from Bihar.
A labourer in Karnail Singh's farm.
Such meticulous planning, the bitch!
That explains the
fucking missing delivery.
Sister fucker!
Let Jackie Chan have him.
Let's go, sister fucker!
Listen... don't kill him.
He is family.
Take him to the fields.
Sir, what to do with her?
She isn't family, right?
Child, the stuff was worth 10 million.
If you wanted to throw it,
then why did you steal it?
Let me go.
Just for a little while.
It won't take long.
Leave me!
- Bitch
Leave me.
- Listen to me.
Leave me. Let me go.
Come.
- Calm down.
Now grab me.
Grab her.
Leave me.
I'll teach her a lesson.
Hold her down.
Leave me, motherfuckers!
""After a whole week...""
""Tommy Singh was finally
released from prison today.""
""While agreeing to his bail,
the court has specified...""
""that his celebrity status
shouldn't warrant any leniency.""
Move aside.
- Tommy, who is the GABRU?
- Where has the GABRU gone?
- Where has Tommy, the GABRU gone?
At least let me get inside. Move.
A single person takes to drugs.
But, it affects the entire family.
Initially,
drugs are taken for pleasure.
Later, drugs become their life goal.
- Open the door, I beg you!
Love, friends, family,
career, education...
Nothing remains!
What do I do with you?
Leave him, Sartaj.
Let him go, son. Let him go.
Leave him.
I'm away from home all day.
How do I know what's happening here?
You all should've
taken care of him.
Everything that is
beautiful within the person,
his adorations in life,
drugs finishes off everything.
I am not reciting hearsay.
I have seen it with my own eyes.
Sign here.
Mother, I want to go home.
Don't worry, son.
Just a little longer.
Shyam, take him to the ward.
Go with them, kiddo.
- Thank you, Doctor.
Let's go, my dear.
Thank you, Madam.
Now it's all up to you. Thank you.
Wait a moment.
- Yes?
Next time, don't come here
in your uniform.
Why?
What were you saying the other day?
You weren't aware of what was
happening with your brother?
Have any idea what's
happening in Jashanpura?
In Amritsar? In Tarn Taran?
In all of Punjab?
Do you have any idea?
You're an Assistant Inspector, right?
Which department?
What is the matter, madam?
Why are you talking to me like this?
What's your 'cut'
for not having an idea?
Ten thousand a week, isn't it?
Then why have you got him here?
Take him to a private clinic in Delhi.
What is it, Madam?
Because I am silent...
What will you say?
It doesn't bother you
to ruin a generation.
But when it <i>comes</i> to
your brother, it hurts?
Madam...
This is what he's addicted to.
A combination of Pheniramine
and buprenorphine.
You must've seen
this bottle somewhere.
Or do you have no idea about this too?
They are two separate drugs...
that should only be
sold with prescription.
But thanks to you, the producers are
combining these drugs...
and sellers are openly selling them
by the name of 'Chaand',
in every chemist shop.
For a mere 50 rupees.
The price of your brother's life!
It's my turn tonight.
Let them go, baby.
Let them go.
All good?
Do you want to do her?
She looks good.
Let go.
I need to buy a phone, sir.
- Buy it next time.
Will you buy it for me?
Sir, what are you doing?
He's a regular on this route.
Sir, leave him, he'll die.
Leave him.
- What happened?
Let it go.
Are you out of your mind?
It is Pehelwan's truck, sister fucker!
Get him water.
It happens. He just lost it.
Hey, get him bandaged.
Here, take this, go on.
You leave the truck at Pehelwan's.
Okay, sir.
Don't mention anything to anyone.
Hurry up.
There is a system.
And everyone has to follow it.
I can handle him being beaten up.
But how can you damage his truck?
It is Pehelwan's truck!
Pehelwan is a Member of Parliament.
Yet he pays our cut. Doesn't he?
He can have both of us suspended.
Brother, I want to go home.
Go home.
Take care of Balli.
Go.
Whatsapp me if there is a problem.
- Make it quick. There's a lot to finish.
- No Issues.
- Everything is in control.
- No, no. It's okay.
- Hey, boss is here.
- Come. Have some tea.
[Vote for Rajveer Singh!
Vote for barbell!]
<i>You are not my mother</i>
<i>But an enemy.</i>
<i>You've sent me to exile too soon.</i>
Hello, baby.
Baby...
Look here!
Look here!
Smile please...
It's nice.
You look pretty.
Tell me if you need anything.
Anything for you.
We've spoilt you.
She is quite petite.
She looked okay on the phone.
New phone?
Yes, sir. I bought it for 8000 rupees.
Eight thousand! You aren't worth it.
New phone!
She won't bite, right?
No, sir. She's well trained now.
Hey, Tommy. My darling child!
Do one thing...
Just make one hit number!
Just one monster hit song!
And then there is that
anti-drug concert.
It's the best step for our image.
Will help the case too.
Public will know that our Tommy
is no more into drugs.
He's clean now.
Told you it's not happening.
Told you!
Uncle...
I think our bro here
can probably do with some inspiration.
Sister fuckers!
Your 'inspiration'
sent my boy to jail.
Now, if you even mention it...
- I am sorry, uncle.
I want to go to London.
I want to go to London!
I have to go to London.
You shut up!
Killed your mother!
I want to go to London!
Going to London, fuckers!
Open the door, Monty.
I say open the door.
- Please, sir.
Please, sir. Stop.
Please don't.
- I'll shoot!
No... no!
- Move away.
Bro, what are you doing?
- Get out of my way.
<i>I'll</i> shoot.
- No... no!
Son...
Son, the court will decide
if you can go or not.
You only do your concert.
I don't want to do the concert.
I want to go.
Please let me go, uncle.
Sister fucker!
You'll shoot me? Me?
I made you a star.
Your father had abandoned you, sister fucker!.
- I want to go, uncle.
I got your younger sister married, fucker!
- I want to go...
And you'll shoot me? Shoot me!
Let me go.
Shoot... shoot!
- Call your mom in the morning.
Get up Kiddo.
Get up, child. Easy!
- No!
Have the medicine.
Have. You'll feel better.
- I won't!
It isn't bitter.
Very good!
They're luring voters with drugs this
election, not alcohol or blankets.
Trucks are loaded with this stuff.
Godowns are getting filled.
It's a well organized operation.
Party workers will be
distributing them in every village.
I will drag Pehelwan
by his balls to jail.
I will either lose
my job or I will get shot.
You decide if you want to
take it to the media.
It may get difficult to
hush the matter later.
Might get your name
on all the front pages too!
Fighting from within the system...
and shouting slogans
from the sidelines...
You'll realise the difference
with this case, madam.
Hey listen... hello!
What's the point in arresting
Pehelwan alone?
What?
There is a Pehelwan sitting
in every district.
So?
Pehelwan is just a dealer
of these drugs.
The manufacturers are
the ones to be arrested.
Find out about their factory.
Raid them.
Madam, have you seen my uniform?
How many stars do I have?
One star.
What does one star mean?
D.l.G.? Commissioner?
I am only an Assistant.
You said that this stuff is being
made to lure voters.
So there must be
a political connection.
There is no political connection.
This is politics!
The sermons that you give
on TV about narco politics.
This is it.
So many MPs are dealers themselves.
We can shout from the rooftops,
no one will listen to us.
Election Commission.
Elections will take place in a month.
Right now, the Commission
is powerful in the state.
Add media pressure to that,
they'll be forced to take action.
But everything has to be
done before the elections.
I am sorry about yesterday.
Hang on.
I just want to talk to you.
Sir, I am just a driver.
From the factory to the godown,
and godown to the factory.
I don't know about these games.
Your factory is in Barotiwala
near the Himachal border, isn't it?
Come, let's take a ride.
No, sir. I will lose my job.
I came from my village
just to earn a living.
I have to arrange for
my sister's wedding, too.
<i>Fuck off!</i>
I've been snooping around
the factory for four days, madam.
Inside out.
Took lot of pics too.
From outside, the factory appears
to be shut for long.
Just some guards outside.
Work happens in the morning shift.
9 AM through 7 PM.
Covertly.
I searched everywhere but
I found nothing.
Looked into the workshop, too.
Inspected the machines.
I saw some oil bottles there
but no names on them.
No factory signboard either.
We won't get information
about the owners from here.
These are the chemicals used
to make this drug.
Ethanol, Hydrochloric Acid, Methyl,
Paraben, Maleic Acid, Opium.
They aren't easy to procure.
Some are imported...
and some are controlled.
Like Opium.
Only two places in India where
opium is legally manufactured...
Neemuch and Ghazipur.
Detailed paper work is required
to source opium from there...
with thorough inspection.
Any random company
can't procure from there.
It is issued to licensed
pharmaceutical companies only.
Now, if they are procuring such large
amounts of opium...
it means either a pharma company or
its employee is supplying them illegally.
And they are doing all the paper
work behind a bogus company.
If we find out the name of
this company and its owner
we'll understand the entire
political nexus, Sartaj.
That's it. Their game will be over.
I'm slow in these matters.
I barely made it past college.
I've been at it since four days.
Whatever I could find, I have.
You can take someone's help.
Whose help can I take?
If anyone in the
department finds out...
Think, Sartaj. Think of something.
Are you bloody mad?
Only you know this chemical business.
Are you out of your mind? No way!
We will go after the shift is over.
Except for two watchmen,
nobody is going to be there.
We don't have to go today.
Maybe after a couple of days.
This is not my job, Sartaj.
I am a doctor. A lady at that.
All the men in Punjab
are drugged out, madam.
Now it's up to the ladies.
You have saved Balli's life.
I won't let anything happen to you.
Careful!
Where is Tommy's Diet Coke?
I had the Diet Coke kept.
Where is the Diet Coke?
- Where is the Diet Coke, sister f****r!?
Get the Diet Coke.
This should have been put first.
Careful.
Get it fast.
Son, it happens.
It was cocaine's withdrawal symptom
Love you...
Hug <i>me</i> as well, daddy.
How are you?
- All okay?
Do you want a dose?
- No.
Our man's shooting up at the back.
Go join.
I have a bad stomach.
Okay then.
They've put us on a double shift.
They think we are dogs.
Why don't you say something?
There's no point to it.
Who cares about us?
Tommy! Tommy!
Move aside.
There was an election rally at Jashanpura,
organized by Maninder Brar...
He addressed over thousand people...
He raised the issue of
drugs ruining the youth...
He appealed to the people,
asking their support in this issue.
I want to tell the youth of Punjab...
that this whole fight,
this war on drugs,
is above all, an individual war.
We're with you in this war.
We are here to support you.
I appeal to the the youth of Punjab,
to fight it back!
My dear young ones, march on!
We are with you.
My dear young ones, march on!
We are with you.
Hey, Kaka, Lucky, Sonu!
Get up all of you!
She's running away.
Found anything?
Look at this.
They want to ruin all of Punjab.
What are they on to?
There is nothing here, Sartaj.
Let's look over there.
Come on. Let's get going.
Wasn't it a day off today?
- Sir, the Ghazipur goods are here.
Sartaj, I think this
is the consignment
This is what we were looking for.
Do you have a safety pin?
Come out as soon as I call you. Okay?
<i>Okay.</i>
Don't worry. I am here.
- Be careful.
- Watch it, it's heavy.
- Keep it here.
- Hurry.
- Get that here.
- Faster.
- Move it.
- <i>Easy...'</i>
- I got it...
[Opium and Alkaloids]
- Move it.
Good job.
Brother, please take over.
What happened?
What's with the power?
I think the power has gone out.
Even I know that.
The power has not gone.
There are lights outside.
Only our factory is blacked out.
I think the fuse must have blown.
Why are you standing here
and talking about it?
Do something.
Come on.
- Come.
Check if there's a lose connection.
Turn the damn generator on!
Just find some help.
Everything is okay here...
Did you find anything?
No. Everything is okay here.
Turn the damn generator on!
This damn power cut!
Thank God, the power's back on.
Everybody back to work.
What was the problem?
The fuse was down.
Come on hurry up.
Come on.
Sartaj...
Sartaj, come on.
<i>Leave it. I'll ride.</i>
Sit tight.
Stop!
Tommy, try the blonde look.
It will suit you.
GABRU, The Great!
My hero...
The crowd is in a crazy mood.
Rock the show!
Daddy, relax!
You're adding to the pressure.
What is your problem?
We're just talking.
None of your business.
I can't do this.
Ricky, enough already!
You want to turn him into Lady Gaga?
Funny, eh?
Get lost.
<i>I will</i> thrash you.
Brother, I understand.
If there's no fuel in the car,
will it run?
<i>Never.</i>
And our car is a
Range Rover.
When you drive a Range Rover,
you need more fuel.
Fuel.
Now you tell me,
who's the GABRU?
Say it!
Get ready quickly.
I am out of here.
And yeah, I love you, too!
Where is it?
Can I say something, madam?
Go on.
I...
Sartaj...
I want to take you on a date.
Sartaj...
Will you come to
a coffee shop with me?
Sartaj?
Madam...
I've never seen a lady like you.
You are surrounded by filth.
Yet, you are absolutely clean.
Dignity.
Okay. Now get up.
You sitting too far away, madam.
Do you know?
What hit me the most...
Life's <i>worst</i> tragedy, Madam,
To lose someone you love,
And not being able
to do anything about it.
Father had passed away.
If my brother had too...
That day, you didn't save
him, but me instead.
Sartaj, look at me.
Look at me.
Now show me your tongue.
Martyr Sartaj Singh.
Nothing is going to happen to Balli.
Nothing.
Are you sure?
Promise.
Brave warrior-madam, Preet Sahni!
Commander, drugs on war.
Not drugs on war,
war on drugs.
And I am no hero.
I am only trying.
There are two wars going on in Punjab.
The one you and I are fighting
against people like Pehelwan,
against the system.
That is easy.
The real war on drugs...
is the one that people
like Balli are fighting.
With themselves.
If they win, we win.
If they lose, Punjab...
loses!
And so, Punjab has lost!
Sartaj...
What happened?
Okay. Come here.
Where could she be?
- Look over there!
Presenting Tommy, the GABRU!
Bro, are you okay?
Rock and roll, bro.
GABRU!
GABRU!
Have you seen him?
Has anyone seen GABRU?
How will you see him?
Some are lying in the gutters.
Swimming in their own vomit.
And some have already
made it to the other side.
Dead!
Sing us a song already!
<i>I willsing a song, too.</i>
First, hear what I have to say.
Meet me.
Do you want to meet him?
Do you want to meet
the real Tommy Singh?
Statutory warning -
He's no GABRU!
Now, do you want to meet him?
Then... here is Tommy
Singh in 3,2,1...
<i>[L-O-S-E-R]</i>
This is Tommy Singh.
Loser!
A small town boy,
Tejender Singh Loser,
Scored a visa and went to
Birmingham, once upon a time.
Somehow his music worked.
Otherwise, he would be driving a cab.
Or waiting tables.
He scraped through high school.
He just knew one thing.
Drugs.
And he sang about it.
And you folks thought
it was philosophy?
You folks are bigger
losers than I am, fuckers!
Come on, sing the song already!
And you're the biggest loser,
since you still don't get it!
We aren't here for your sermons.
Sing or get lost!
Sing or get lost.
Sing or get lost!
You want to hear a song?
Do you?
Where's the car? Fuck!
Where is the Range Rover?
Oh damn!
He must be here somewhere.
Get the car quickly.
Stay back!
Let me hide.
Who are you?
Tommy.
A dog?
A singer. Tommy Singh.
Please let me hide.
Over there.
Thank you.
- Shut up!
Do you have stuff?
Who you hiding from?
From myself.
Huh?
From myself.
Moron.
The biggest one.
Not bigger than me, Tommy boy.
Oh, come on!
I am the champion of morons.
His Highness Moron Number One.
Look where I've landed up.
You think I lost my way here?
If you hear my story,
you'll shit your pants.
Let it be.
It is even written on my head.
<i>Look.</i>
<i>Look.</i>
That's L-O-S-E-R written.
- Yes, loser.
They mean the same thing.
How so?
A loser is a loser,
a moron is a moron.
That makes sense.
A loser is a loser...
and a moron is a moron.
Wear it.
I was wondering...
I wont be able to do it alone.
Will you commit suicide with me?
Get lost!
I am not that big a moron.
Loser, don't you plant
these ideas in my head.
Hit me. You also fucking hit me.
Then why are you talking rubbish?
What else should I do?
Who wants to hear
the fucking right thing?
They only want rubbish which
I've said for four years.
Made <i>me</i> a pop star! The Fuck!
A pop star at fucking 22!
Asian underground number three.
Tommy, the GABRU!
And now... poof!
Think... if someone tells you
that your best times are over.
And they won't come back.
The stuff is finished.
Party over!
Go home.
Sorry.
Run away!
Bloody loser!
Why won't the good times come?
Look what's become of me...
I am no moron.
Hockey champion,
district player!
I thought I'd see good times
if I played state level.
But my father dropped dead.
When I got over that...
my hockey stick was
replaced with a sickle.
Left home, reached Sarhota
village to work in the farms.
One day a packet flew from the skies.
I thought, if I sold it,
I'd finally see good times.
That's it. The biggest fuck up!
I got busted, damn it!
They've turned me into an animal.
They took turns to do me...
Sometimes all motherfuckers together.
Do you know what
I've been through, loser?
Do you know? Do you?
Besides this,
everything else.
Do you understand?
Let's leave.
There's this big billboard
I can see from the window
An ad for a Goa holiday.
That's all I keep staring at
all the time, without a blink.
Because I believe that,
that is my 'good time'.
And that day will come.
And when it does, I will ask it.
Where were you all this while?
Waiting for me to be decimated?
Is that what it takes for you to come?
But here I am and
I refuse to fall apart!
I am standing right here!
Still waiting.
Your Punjab failed me, loser!
I've never touched a cigarette.
And now I'm hooked to the needle.
Why don't you quit it?
What?
Punjab?
Or the needle?
What is your name?
Sartaj?
Punjab police filed a case against Tommy
Singh for lewd and Lascivious behaviour.
The court has issued a non-bailable
warrant against Tommy Singh.
The Punjab government
has condemned this...
and has asked for Tommy's
immediate arrest.
Forgive her.
- I'm going to kill the bitch!
If the boss found out...
No. I will talk to her.
Please forgive her.
Brother...
Relax, let me handle it.
What is left of her anyway?
She's a chewed out bone.
Let's chop and throw her.
No. Let me talk to her.
Assure them you won't do it again.
<i>She won't.</i>
Bunch of sister fuckers!
Keep her under control.
I am really mad at you.
Baby, understand.
You can't manage
on your own.
Do you know how
expensive heroin is?
You'll have to sleep with
someone for money.
Will you like that?
They're only going to use you.
But, Sonu loves you, baby.
Baby...
Don't run away again. Okay?
Sartaj!
Come here!
<i>Look.</i>
Some Virender Singh
is behind all this.
The owner of Deluxe Pharmaceuticals.
Deluxe Pharmaceuticals is
the front in whose name...
government controlled
opium is being sourced.
It's a fake company.
There is nothing about it online.
The telephone numbers
also don't work.
But guess what I did?
I logged on to Registrar of
Companies website
and found out owner details.
It's some Virender Singh
from village Havelian.
Who is this Virender Singh?
I thought the owner would
be a big politician.
I don't know.
Could be a political stooge.
Madam...
Last night...
Are you okay now?
Balli, stop.
Let me go.
- Wait.
Chetan, hold him.
Balli, listen...
Thorazine, quick!
Balli?
Stop. Drop me here.
On Radio Bollywood,
I am your RJ Manveer.
It's 9 AM. Tommy Singh's been
absconding for the past 12 hours.
<i>Bro, Tommy'.!</i>
What's going on, brother?
Tommy, you have any idea...
I have lots to tell you.
What happened?
Come with me.
- What happened?
Sit down.
First let's check into a hotel.
I have to freshen up.
I haven't eaten since last night.
And there's this girl
that I have to save.
For once think of someone
other than yourself, asshole!
Do you know where my dad is, Tommy?
They've put him in jail.
The police must be beating him
asking him where Tommy is.
If it were up to me, Tommy...
I'd hand you over
to the police myself.
But you do as you please,
you're on your own now.
And forgive me.
Jassi, listen.
- I don't want to listen.
It's not what you think.
The girl's in deep trouble,
some heroin mafia shit.
We need some money
to get her released.
After that I will do
whatever you ask...
Surrender.
You were my hero.
When you came from London,
I danced with joy.
'My cool cousin!'
'My cool cousin!'
Sisterfucker!
Now just look at this 'cool cousin'.
GABRU's crew tee.
I used to wear it with pride.
To hell with it, sisterfucker!
Jassi.
There's no love in your heart,
only cocaine.
Remember that, f****r!
Listen up.
- Jassi is dead.
Your uncle is dead.
It's not what you think.
We have to save her!
Sometimes I get high
with just your touch.
<i>""Girl, I am standing by your side,
Won't budge an inch even if I died.""</i>
<i>""Girl, I am standing by your side,
Won't budge an inch even if I died.""</i>

I quit the white powder</i>
<i>Hide me, don't let me cower.</i>
<i>For you, my white angel,
I quit the white powder,</i>
<i>Hide me, don't let me cower.</i>
Sir, we've reached Sarhota.
Is this Sarhota?
- Yes.
There this girl, from your village.
Which block?
Don't know.
Name?
Don't know that either.
Idiots get me riled,
early in the morning!
She may be from Bihar.
From Bihar?
Maybe at Karnail Singh's fields?
Lot of women from Bihar work there.
She ran away.
Didn't <i>even</i> take her stuff along.
Who did she go with?
Do you know anything?
No idea, sir.
She was the silent type.
Her name?
She had a strange name.
Pushpa, what was
the hockey girl's name?
What do I know?
I used to call her 'birdbrain'.
Who is the dealer over here?
Tell me, you fucker!
You can take some from me if you want.
Supply is down.
Cut it out!!
What happened?
Our dealer,
Bhandi, is in the hospital.
His gang beat him up over a bad deal.
Okay then, have a nice day!
Holy shit! Doesn't he
look just like Tommy?
Yeah, bro!
[GABRU]
Why would an MD of a pharma
company live here?
You listening?
Praise the lord!
That's a nice house.
Grace of God.
Mobiles don't work in our village.
But I have a phone at home.
You can speak to Virender
if you want
No, that's fine.
Since we were around,
we thought we'd say hello.
It's been a while.
What's he up to these days?
Same. Driving.
Private car?
Yes. With Amar Pal Singh.
Mr. Brar's son-in-law.
Maninder Brar?
Yes.
I remember.
Virender had mentioned
that they are like family
Hey, get the family album.
Mr. Brar's entire family had danced
at my son's wedding.
There was so much pomp.
Virender is looking so good.
Of course.
We must be going.
Left from here.
- Yes.
Oh no.
What happened?
Police.
Greetings.
What is it?
How is everything?
- All good.
I was saying...
Get out of here, bloody junkies!
Get lost!
Relax, will you.
What happened to the boy?
I think he's got an attack.
Doctor!
Don't hit me more.
No. Don't worry. Be quiet.
I am your brother.
Your brother's been beaten
to pulp, my man.
I know, bro. I know.
But there this girl.
Fuckers fed me to Jackie.
Listen to me.
Fucker, chewed out my bones.
Bloody listen!
This girl from Bihar who is in
trouble with the heroin mafia.
It's very important that I meet her.
I've never done anything for anyone.
Let me do this once.
It'll set me free.
Sorry. Listen to me.
Listen to me.
After a long time,
there's a tune in my head.
And it is thanks to the girl.
Ever since I've met her,
I just don't feel like taking cocaine.
I've got my 'mojo' back.
You know mojo, man. It's back!
Tommy?
- Yes.
Tommy.
Dude.
Where is the girl?
- THE Tommy.
Where is the girl?
Sing me a song.
Just one song.
- Who is inside?
I can't sing here.
It'll make me feel lot better.
Tell me.
Sing-
. okay-
You'll have to tell me then!
Sure.
Just one song!
- Okay, calm down!

This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (July 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this message)

(Kangana Ranaut) is a young divorcee who lives with her parents and works in the housekeeping department in one of the five-star hotels of Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

She shares a bitter relationship with her dad who is always blaming her for her mistakes in the past, instead of giving her moral support; so now, Praful wants to move out and buy her own house.

She has applied for a loan and her loan gets pre-approved. In the meantime, Praful decides to go with her cousin on a trip to Las Vegas (her cousin pays for all tickets and accommodations).

In Las Vegas, she plays baccarat for the first time and wins big in her first few rounds. She quickly gets addicted to the game. The next day, she returns to the casino but ends up losing not only the money she won the previous day but a large chunk of her savings also.

Praful then returns to Atlanta after a week, only to find out that her bank application to the bank has been rejected as her credit rating is very low. Praful seeks her father's help but he insists that she should meet a young man named Sameer (Sohum Shah) who has been selected as her suitor.

After meeting with the suitor, she has mixed feelings about marriage and agrees to get engaged. However, her addiction to gambling takes a toll on her and Praful gives her last shot to gambling and goes back to Vegas.

Unfortunately, she ultimately loses all her savings so a private money lender spots Praful (who is now drunk) in the casino and offers her money. The drunk Praful – not in her right senses- takes $32,000 from the moneylender and in exchange gives him her driving license.

Praful loses all that borrowed money (along with her hard-earned savings) and has to return penniless to her home.

Praful tries to explain to her father her bad situation and needing his financial help, but in fear of retaliation and hostility, she is reluctant. Her parents want her to begin her wedding preparations and plans with Sameer, who by now gets impressed by her personality.

At a relative's wedding, Praful and Sameer meet again and dance, and get to know each other. However, Praful is threatened by the loan sharks to pay within 10 days or face death, so she is disturbed and anxious, unable to concentrate on her wedding plans.

Therefore, Praful develops the habit of stealing whereby first she disguises herself (wearing oversized sunglasses and a hood) and approaches a cashier at a gas station shop. She collects only $10,000 so she has to go and rob a bank (which she learns how to on YouTube), with a disguise, and hands a note written with red lipstick that says money should be given to her otherwise she will blow the whole bank as she is strapped to a bomb.

Praful's second robbery gets foiled by a bank manager who bumps into her when she tries to rob the bank similarly. When the manager asks her name, Praful tells her name 'Simran', the name of a popular character from an Indian blockbuster film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge which her mother ultimately watches often.

Although Praful's plan to rob the bank gets foiled, she manages to escape and similarly robs another bank.

Praful Patel has now become a most wanted criminal with the name 'Simran – The Lipstick Bandit'. Despite robbing 3 to 4 banks successfully, Praful is still short of collecting fifty thousand dollars.

Meanwhile, Praful develops a liking towards Sameer, and confides in him her bad habits of gambling and stealing which he does not take seriously, thinking it is some kind of a joke. Trouble comes back when loan sharks attack Praful in her hotel for the money and Praful's ex-boyfriend Mike – the general manager of the hotel steals the money from her locker room and refuses to give the money back to her until and unless she submits to his sexual advances/desires.

Praful ultimately hits him and gets suspended from the hotel, after which she tells the loan sharks that her money has been stolen. By now, these loan sharks know that Praful is actually 'Simran – The Lipstick Bandit', so they ask her to rob one more bank and this time with a bigger amount—for which they offer her a gun to finish the job.

Devastated and dejected, Praful calls off her relationship with Sameer and asks him to leave and by telling him the truth. Enraged by this, Praful's father slaps her and asks her to leave his house.

Praful leaves her home and stays with her best friend Salma (Esha Tewari) for a night. The next day Praful attacks the same bank that rejected her bank loan and flees the place after stealing the money.

Sameer is still in love with Praful and to help her, he transfers a huge amount of fifty thousand dollars in her bank account.

Praful, before leaving the city of Atlanta, calls him at a lonely place and tells him that he should find another girl, as he is a nice man and he deserves someone better; not someone like her.

Sameer refuses and asks her to surrender to the police and end this dirty game once and for all; after which Praful's dad calls her and asks for forgiveness. Praful is happy at this and returns home but the police cars have surrounded her and are following her car to arrest her.

Praful drives off because she did not want to get arrested in her neighbourhood, which is full of Indians, and her parents would be very ashamed of her there. The ultimate chase begins as Praful's car is found empty by the police. Praful had taken a taxi and was almost near the airport, but then she decides to surrender on a lonely highway. She asks the taxi to stop at the curbside and then she calls 9–1–1 and surrenders herself.

After her arrest, there is a trial whereby the judge adjudicates Praful to be imprisoned for 10 months, but she is released after 3–4 months due to good behaviour. Her ex-boyfriend Mike is also imprisoned for stealing her money and also for his sexual advance.

During a meeting session in prison, Praful tells her father that she wants to invest all his money into the stock market. Enraged by this, Praful's father becomes angry and grabs her neck angrily, venting his frustration that all his hard-earned money will blow up in smoke due to her crazy intentions.

The film ends with titles suggesting that Praful has been released from jail and she has sold the rights of her movie to be made to a Bollywood producer for fifty thousand dollars.",6532,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt6405126.srt","Look at poor Mike.
How he's looking at you
like a lovesick puppy.
Poor Mike, he didn't even survive
your one-year relationship curse.
Six months.
Tell me something,
what's going on with your apartment?
My loan is almost approved.
I'm going there today.
Leaving early.
- Where is it?
It's in Duluth,
near the Italian hotel Fredrico's.
It must have cost you a bomb.
700,000 dollars
is market cost.
But I'm getting it
for 400,000.
How?
- Minority housing.
Praful, you are one
hundred percent Gujarati!
Hello! I've worked hard for it,
for seven years.
And you don't have any kids.
I have parents!
Why isn't 503 cleaned?
503 had a 'Do Not Disturb' board.
No worries.
Just telling that you that they
called and I had Thelma clean it up.
No... we were having lunch,
they must have removed the board.
Sorry.
Well then,
why don't I just join you guys...
Who is calling me?
Have a nice lunch, ladies.
- Thank you.
Praful!
Paradise awaits me
And beckons
With open arms
Dear Life
Now break the shackles
and live a little...
Dear Life
Very nice, eh?
Yeah?
There's lots of sunlight
coming in through that window there.
And there's a park out front.
So, no chance of a building
popping up, blocking your view.
And there's an Indian
temple right around the block.
Indian temple?
Oh... That is a Gurudwara.
We are Hindus.
That is for Sikhs.
Oh okay.
Oh, there's an Indian
Kebab place two blocks away.
But I am a vegetarian.
Oh. Okay.
Vegetarian!
Right! Well...
You know what,
let me help you with that.
It's kinda tricky.
You gotta have the magic touch.
There you go.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
And I'll see you outside.
Break the shackles and fly away...
Spread your wings and fly away...
Break the shackles and fly away...

This apartment is a steal, Ms. Patel.
Just yesterday,
we sold a place for 800,000 dollars.
I know. My...
My mortgage should
come through by next week.
Okay, great.
So I'll draw up the paperwork and how
about we meet in my office on Monday?
Yes.
- Okay.
Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. Steven.
Have a good day.
Hello... Hello, Ms. Julie.
- Hi.
I'm here to meet Ms. Cynthia.
Please tell her.
- Okay. I'll let her know you're here.
I'm waiting here.
Okay.
- My name is Praful Patel.
Gotcha.
Hey Cynthia, your appointment is here.
Okay, I'll let her know.
Ms. Patel, Cynthia will see you now.
- Thank you.
Ma'am, if you can process
my loan little quickly.
I have two weeks...
Well, it's good that you got a pre
approval on the mortgage. - Yes.
It shouldn't be a problem.
I just need to check your
credit scores and we should be fine.
This is my...
- Alright.
I just need you to sign this.
And this.
And...
This.
Can I borrow your pen?
- Yes.
Over here?
- Yes.
Alright, I'll call you on Monday.
Alright! Okay.
Thank you.
One margherita pizza please.
And... garlic bread also.
Hello, Amber...
Sorry, I missed all your calls.
I've been quite busy.
So tell me, all the preparations
for the wedding going smooth...
My To-be-bride?
Listen Praf, you have to come
to Las Vegas with me.
Las Vegas? What for?
Nothing. We'll shop,
Like a bachelorette.
Just you and me.
Bachelorette?
With me?
Wendy and other
friends are not coming?
No Praf, it's just you and me.
That is sweet.
But Amber,
I'm kind of saving up for my house.
So, I won't be able to spend much...
Hey, I'm paying for the trip.
You're coming for free!
Really?
Las Vegas for free!
Good offer.
But...
But I can't.
I won't be able to make it.
Praf...
No way... Not again!
What problem do you
have with my flowers?
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- You destroy them every day!
I've got margherita pizza for you.
Lock the car.
Come in.
You should go back to the driving school.
- Come on! Come on! Come on!
Oh wow!
Just what I had in mind!
I've been craving for some pizza.
Why so generous today?
What's the occasion?
Papa, you have a small
pocket and a small heart!
So says the miser.
As if you're super generous.
I've been feeding you two
since the past 30 years...
... and what have you spent on this family
from the time you've started earning?
Papa, let me buy my house.
Then my salary will be at
your disposal and you'll be rich!
Buying property is no joke!
What do you know about the area?
Whether it has any appreciation?
You have to understand all these
factors. Do you even know any of this?
What makes you think they'll
approve your loan?
Papa, you always underestimate me.
To make the impossible possible,
that's what Praful Patel does!
Stop nagging her...
Let her invest.
You're always sitting
behind the counter of a shop.
She's just come home, tired, after
sweeping and mopping floors all day.
Let her eat in peace.
- Mummy, it's not sweeping and mopping.
I work in the hotel industry.
What did I teach you?
- Yeah.
Housekeeping department.
- Yeah, yeah.
Show some respect. - I spend
my day sitting behind a counter.
And you? In front of the computer...
Shopping online all day long.
It's not like I'm buying
gold or diamonds...
I buy groceries for the house.
That too because my knees trouble me.
Do you have the money
for a visit to the doctor?
Is it an emergency?
She is your daughter. Talk to her...
I am saying this for her own good.
If she has saved some money then
she should invest it in my business.
Business?
Your Gujarati snacks business?
Papa, it is below my intelligence.
As if you have conquered
Everest with your intelligence.
I've been working like a servant
so you could have a better future.
I called you here to get an education.
But you decided to fall
in love as soon as you got here.
You got married despite
our disapproval.
And she couldn't even handle that.
She got divorced even
though we told her not to.
And she talks about intelligence.
Praful, people get out and
achieve the impossible here.
... and look at you,
you're still a burden to me.
It would've been better if
I hadn't asked you two to come here.
We were better off in Ahmedabad.
I'm buying my own house so that
I'm no longer a burden to you.
Really?
- So what is the problem now?
Huh?
- Why don't you get married, dear?
You will get your own house too!
In a few years, these proposals
you are getting now will also stop.
And why do you want your own house?
To call your boyfriends over?
Yes, I'll call my boyfriends.
What? You'll call
your boyfriends over?
No. It's better you don't buy
your own house.
She's a girl that too a divorcee.
And she talks about bringing
her boyfriends over.
She wants to ruin my image in society.
- What society are you talking about?
You are on the grassroots level
of the society you are talking about.
You can see everyone up there,
but no one wants to look down, at you.
Nobody cares. So just chill.
Did you hear that?
How highly our daughter thinks of me?
The things she says
about her own father!
Exactly why she couldn't
achieve anything so far.
Mistakes, mistakes and more mistakes!
Kumud, let me give it
to you in writing.
She is once again
going to make a mistake!
Yes, I'll make mistakes!
I make mistakes!
But I also agree to making them.
I don't lie to myself like you two.
Look at yourselves.
If this is how married couples behave,
then it's better to be a divorcee.
Get out of my house then!
If we are so bad then
why do you stay with us?
Get out of my house!
Don't yell! It will do you more harm.
All because of you!
- You'll get a heart attack.
We have just one daughter!
Just eat the pizza.
- And you couldn't even take care of her.
What have I...
You two have made
my life a living hell.
I'd rather be dead.
- Will you stop it and just eat?
This is all because of you.
Because of me?
Go! You too go with her.
Yes, I would, but I cannot walk!
You don't have the money for the doctor!
- I should have left you both in Ahmedabad...
Hello, Amber?
Let's go to Vegas.
This is... This is like so big...
Quite big for one person.
Don't look back.
Why?
- Your idiot ex is here.
Come on, let's leave.
Hey!
- Hi!
How you doing?
So good to see you.
- Good to see you too.
Hi.
Hello.
You're Amber's cousin?
The one who works in the hotel.
- Yeah, Praf.
I met you at your engagement,
which you both broke.
You both carry on.
I'll see you in the hotel.
Praf...
No one at home should
find out about this.
I can trust you, right?
That's why I am here...
That's why you brought
me along and no one else.
You can trust me.
Are you seriously upset?
It's not a big deal.
You could have told me.
But anyway, don't worry.
Just don't elope with him.
Otherwise, your family will kill me.
I'm getting married soon.
I'm only here to say goodbye.
Say your goodbye and
I'll see you in the hotel.
But where will you go?
I'll find something sinful
to do in this sin city.
Put money.
Put money.
- I don't have money.
No, no. Put money.
Yes, it's my job.
Hello.
- Hey! How are you?
This is nice.
- Yes.
How much is this for?
- That's 10 dollars.
10 dollars? Can you give me in five?
No, I cannot sell it for less than 10.
How much is this for?
- 20 dollars.
If you give me two then
in 10 I can buy this. - Thank you.
No, it's 10 dollars.
- But this is not for 10 dollars.
Take it. It's my gift to you.
Take it? - Yes, take it.
My gift to you. Okay?
Thank you.
- Yeah.
That clip, how much?
I can pay for this.
Take it, my gift. Take it.
Thank you.
Well, hello.
Hello.
- How's it going?
Good.
- Alright, what can I get you, babe?
I want some pink
champagne and some caviar.
Yeah.
- But I cannot afford it.
So give me some beer.
And some french-fries
complimentary from your side.
Ah, well we don't
have free french-fries.
Chips?
No chips either.
Peanuts?
- We have some peanuts.
Get some then.
- Alright, alright.
Calm down.
Hey!
How you doing?
Yeah
You like that?
He's hot.
Yeah, he was here last night.
I think he is here for the weekend.
But he's by himself.
You think I should try my luck?
Of course, look at where you are.
You're in Vegas.
I am in Vegas.
- Go for it. Get him.
Hello.
I'm Prafu...
I'm Praf from Atlanta.
Are you tired?
Because you are running in my mind.
I saw it.
But I mean it was kinda cheesy.
You can do better.
I can do better but
I need another chance.
He left.
No, he's probably playing Baccarat.
He loves that game over there.
What is Baccarat?
Oh, you've never
seen the James Bond movies?
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
There you go.
- Pleasure.
Do you want to play?
This is a five-dollar chip.
He will deal the cards.
One to the bank and one to the player.
You have to place
a bet on one of them.
And the number which is
closest to the number nine wins.
Baccarat is all about number nine.
Do you want to play?
Why not?
- Go ahead.
Give me ten dollar chips.
Minimum is 25, ma'am.
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
Take this.
- Oh.
Thank you, buddy.
No problem.
Dave Mehta, New Jersey.
Praful Patel from Atlanta.
Gujarati?
You too?
- Yup.
Shall we?
Let's play.
All set?
Cards are out.
Player wins the set.
We won.
This is yours.
This is 50.
- 50.
All yours.
The bank wins.
There you go! We win again!
We won! Again!
And this is all yours.
Tie.
It's a Tie.
- Oh my God!
There you go!
Player wins.
Player wins.
- Oh man!
Player wins.
Hello?
Amber, I won 2000 dollars!
Huh?
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?
Okay, coming, coming.
I'm coming.
No, I am coming.
Thank you very much.
Amber!
Get it out.
Get it all out.
Just let it all come out.
Nikhil is bad, Praf.
You shouldn't have met him.
I think I'm still in love with him.
Then why don't you marry him?
Because he doesn't
want to get married.
Then don't marry anyone.
That is not how it happens, Praf.
You cannot spend your life alone.
I'm doing just fine.
Not you.
You're so different and independent.
I'm a 30-year-old divorcee.
You are a 25-year-old young girl.
I'm a housekeeper.
You're a jewelry designer.
How can I be more
independent than you?
I don't know, Praf.
Don't ask me these questions.
By the way, you're going
to meet Hitesh at my wedding.
If he's going to
attend it then I am not.
Don't be so serious. He's
not coming.
Why don't you come with Mike?
Mike is last season.
You left him as well?
There was a small girl.
She asked her mother,
""Mother, what is a boyfriend?""
Her mother said ""If you become
a good girl you will get one.""
Then the small girl said,
""Mother, if I become a bad girl?""
The mother said ""Then
you will get many.""
What!
God, You're so weird!
Heavenly angels
Brought heaven closer
What I see on the ground...
Is it a guiding light or a refuge...
Shadows of heaven...
Have bestowed heaven upon me...
Dear life...
Fate has changed...
Now break the bond and live a little...
How are you?
I am okay.
- I have got something for you.
What's this?
Please keep it.
Thank you.
Break the prison and fly away...
Spread your wings and fly away...
Break the prison and fly away...
Spread your wings and fly away...
Wow!
My gosh, you look amazing.
That dress!
400 dollars.
And your lipstick!
50 dollars.
Now get me some pink champagne.
You mean beer and peanuts?
No, I mean pink champagne.
Yeah!
Hello!
- Hello! Welcome to the game.
Give me... chips for... for 200.
Okay.
It looks like we've got
some unfinished business.
I hope you don't lose
all that money today.
Place your bets.
Player.
Bank.
Player.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Hi.
- Hi.
I'm Adam from California.
Hi, Adam.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Why did you leave after
losing just two games?
Because I don't have
more money to play now.
You know, you can win a
lot of money by playing baccarat.
In just a few minutes.
You just have to
play five to six rounds.
Why five to six rounds?
I've read that
when you play five to six rounds...
...your chances of winning are higher,
like last night.
Ya, I won.
Let me get that.
I cannot take your tip for free.
Fine.
I'll make you work for it.
Where is the protection?
I don't have it.
You don't have protection?
No.
Wait... No, it's fine.
Zip my dress up!
You are a cute guy,
but not a decent guy.
No protection no sex, my friend.
Hey Dave!
Praf! How are you?
How you doing?
- Great!
What's this?
- I won this at the table today!
Yes.
- Where you played?
I am playing at the big table.
I am going to cash
this and enjoy myself.
Bye, see you!
- Bye, you look beautiful Praf!
Praful! What the hell are you doing?
We are going to miss our flight.
Sorry, sorry!
I need to play one more round.
I can't miss this flight.
You stay and gamble if you want to.
I'm going.
Just one round!
- You haven't even packed yet!
Amber, just one round.
Amber!
Packing will take two minutes!
Wait! Amber!
Amber, wait!
So you're trying to say that...
... you lost all the money you won...
... and you also lost 8000 out of the
money you had saved for your house?
I just needed one more round!
What do you mean you
needed one more round, Praf?
Gambling is like that only.
If you don't lose how will you win?
You need to lose some to win some.
Praf! Get a hold of yourself, man!
This is how people
get into big trouble.
8000 dollars is a lot of money!
Hello.
Where have you been?
Look dear, we cannot live our
lives like Amber and her parents.
They can afford it.
They're rich. We aren't.
Mohan, let her at
least take a breather.
Praful, have you eaten
or shall I get you something?
No, she must be tired from
all the sightseeing in Vegas.
Sure. Please, go ahead.
Feed her all you want.
She has all the money to have fun.
Where do you get the money from?
Praful!
The electricity bill is due.
It's kept on the table. Pay it.
Hello, Mr. Steven.
- Ms. Patel.
We were supposed to meet
today to discuss paperwork?
Are you okay?
Mr. Steven.
I've fallen sick. Very badly.
Have you been to the doctor?
I need one more week you see.
I... I have multiple health problems.
I'll try the best I can.
I have, I have the money it's
just that my health is not okay.
Okay, well please just
take care of yourself. Okay?
I'll talk to you later.
Hey Cynthia,
you've got a customer, Ms...?
Patel! - Ms. Patel.
She said she just wants two minutes.
Just two... just... yeah.
Alright.
Okay, I'll let her in.
Okay.
- Thank you.
Hello ma'am, I just want to
know when is my loan getting approved?
Give me a moment, please.
I tried to call many times
but I did not get any appointment.
No response.
Ms. Patel...
I have been through your account
and as much as I'd like to help...
You're not eligible for a loan.
Why?
Your credit rating is very low.
It seems you've emptied
your account in one day.
That was for something urgent.
But I have the pre approval.
You only told me.
Your credit rating is very low.
But if I had funds
why would I need a loan?
I'm sorry but that's how banks work,
Ms. Patel.
Our borrowers borrow money.
People who can't repay try to steal,
not borrow.
Are you trying to
say I am trying to steal?
No, of course not.
But if you really want this loan.
I suggest you work to improve
your funds over the next few months.
But I have...
- You have a good day.
I'll see you later.
Thank you.
Papa!
Why all of a sudden?
Are you feeling alright?
I'm being affectionate.
Can't I?
What's this?
Tomato and pepper curry.
Papa, my friend Salma's father
passed away from a heart attack.
That made me think that I
shouldn't trouble my parents so much.
It happens. It happens.
You shouldn't let it bother
you so much. It happens.
Papa, will you come with
me to see my flat tomorrow?
Why me, all of a sudden?
Not all of a sudden.
I've decided that I won't
do anything without your permission.
Sorry, I was about go buy a house...
... for myself without informing
you or taking your advice.
But papa, I want to invest
in this property only with you.
We will buy a joint property.
Really?
Joint property?
I don't think you know
anything about investment.
If you need help then
why don't you say so.
Okay. Well, why hide
anything from you, papa...
Help me a little?
I can help you,
but I have a condition.
Tell me.
We have got a very
good marriage proposal.
He's the son of the owner
of Parekh Hosiery in Rajkot.
He's very handsome.
And he is single.
If you meet him...
Welcome back!
- Thank you!
So is it a beer or
champagne kinda day?
No drinking.
I have to win my money back.
You... you mean you have
to win back the money you lost.
I lost some of my savings.
I am in trouble.
Look, I am not supposed to say this...
... but if I were you,
I wouldn't go back and play.
Any more bets?
Okay, no more bets?
Player shows six.
Banker banks on nine.
Banker wins.
Excuse me!
What you want, huh?
Here's a watch.
It's worth 15,000 at least.
What about the car outside?
I'll give you the pink slip, alright?
65,000 any day.
Mike, you owe me 85,000 dollars.
I couldn't get 10 for this.
And your car... is a piece of junk.
Place you bets please.
Ma'am, are you okay?
You guys have taken it all away.
You have stolen everything.
This is cheating!
Ma'am, please calm down.
I want to talk to the owner.
Ma'am, please calm down.
You guys have stolen
my seven years' worth savings.
Calm down or we'll
have to call security.
Call your owner.
I... I will not go anywhere.
I will be here today!
Calm down, calm down.
Are you the owner?
Come on. Come here.
I want to talk to you.
- We can talk. Come here.
Come here. We can talk. We can talk.
Give me my money back. You
are cheaters, all of you are cheaters!
You are all thieves!
I'm not the owner. I'm not the owner.
I'm a private moneylender.
You wanna win all your money back,
don't you?
I lost all my savings.
It's all good, baby.
So how much you need?
You are very sweet.
You want to give me money.
You're a nice man.
It's all good. It's all good.
So how much do you need?
25,000?
No.
32,000.
- That's it.
I want to show him a lesson!
Hey...
- You cheaters...
I'm going to need your
social security card.
Why?
- Your drivers' license.
Why?
I just gave you 32,000 dollars,
baby girl!
Thank you, buddy.
You're a good person, huh?
Thank you very much.
- Now go show him a lesson.
Place your bets please.
Place your bets please.
Banker.
Banker.
Hi ma'am,
would you like to buy some more?
Place your bets please.
How many 'Ghaatiyas'
(Gujarati snacks)?
Six.
Six.
Four of 'Sev'(Gujarati snacks),
right?
Five.
- 'Sev'.
Five.
'Bhakarwadi'(Gujarati snacks).
One, two, three, four, five, six...
Mohan's new import.
He has imported snacks from Rajkot.
- Four...
Here, taste it.
Chutney...
Four...
Papa, you were saying
something the other day...
That if I agree to
meet the boy then...
You were saying something like that.
Praful, you...
Now when she is saying
that she'll meet the boy...
... then why are you questioning her?
I suggest you invite
them over tomorrow itself.
Done.
We'll call them over.
Praful, that's Mr. and Mrs. Parekh.
You remember Kaushal?
He has a hosiery shop in Rajkot.
He is his cousin.
How are you, auntie?
How are you, uncle?
All good, dear.
He's Kaushal's elder son.
Sameer.
- Hello.
Hello.
You work in a hotel?
Housekeeping department.
Very good.
She will keep the house clean.
Anyway, a housewife
is a housekeeper, right?
Dear, you have been working
in the same hotel for seven years?
Yes.
After the divorce, right?
Sameer, you have come here for MBA?
Yes, auntie.
Your aunt told me that
you have a new startup plan.
Yes, actually I plan
to make a mobile app.
Wonderful.
Nowadays everyone uses apps.
My wife is an online champion.
She does everything online.
Prayers happening in Atlanta
but pundit sitting in Nathdwara.
Actually,
my app too is related to our culture.
You can view all religious
places in India through that.
You can watch its live telecast.
Press a button and offer flowers.
Press another button
and feed the poor.
Instant karma.
Hail Lord Shiva.
Wonderful.
I think the kids should
talk to each other.
Yes, sure.
Why do you want to get married?
For a green card?
No.
I mean I am doing my MBA here.
I can easily spend two years
here without getting married.
I want to get married
because I am alone.
Life will get better
if I find a life partner.
Anyway, if two people earn
then the expenses get divided.
So your wife will earn
and you will educate yourself?
No.
I have worked for two years.
I have money for my education.
I wanted to be a self-made man.
And I have a plan for that too.
I just need a purpose.
I am searching for it.
You think you will get purpose,
love, companionship...
... all nicely wrapped
in a package called marriage?
I don't know.
I will try to be true to
this relationship to the best I can.
Then we will see where life takes us.
I too gave my best to a relationship.
Look at what happened to me.
What if life brings
you to a similar juncture?
What if you are standing
where I am standing today?
So what's wrong?
The weather is wonderful.
It's not raining either.
And I don't think
my company is that bad either.
Right?
You tend to romanticize things.
You too are quite frank.
It was a pleasure to meet you.
Shall we go back?
Let's go...
Praful.
She's asleep.
No.
Praful, I liked this boy.
Mummy, papa told me that
he would help me if I meet the boy.
What do you mean?
He told me that he would
help me if I meet the boy.
Really? When did that happen?
Mummy...
Tell me, how did you like Sameer?
I'll never get such a house
again in minority housing.
Okay, dear.
Don't worry.
I'll talk to your father
when he's in a good mood.
But at least tell me
what you though of Sameer...
Good night.
Good night.
Hello, Mr. Steven.
Yes, Ms. Patel.
I need some more time.
I'm... I'm sorry Ms. Patel,
but that house is sold.
That house is sold?
Yes.
But you said you will wait for me.
I know, but it has been a while
since you called back, Ms. Patel.
I am sorry I just
couldn't wait anymore.
Granny!
Oh my baby! Come here. Come here.
How are you?
I am fine.
But you neither call,
whatsapp or snapchat.
Don't you miss Nathdwara?
- I do.
Then why this half smile?
It's a full smile.
But it doesn't reach your eyes.
I had found a nice
house in minority housing.
But I lost that deal.
It's okay, you'll find another one.
Oh, my God. Him?
What is he doing here?
Who?
The boy who had come to see me.
- Which one?
That one. The stupid looking one...
oh shit, he saw me.
Hi, Praful.
- Hello.
My granny.
I seek your blessings.
- It's okay. God bless you.
Why do I feel as if
she was badmouthing me?
It's not that...
She was saying that sweet
boy had come to see her.
Did she say that?
- Yes.
Does she like this sweet boy?
She likes you.
It's not so.
I still haven't thought about that.
After all she's a girl.
This...
I knew I'd find Praful
here so I brought this along.
What's this?
Have a look.
This belongs to my grandma.
I wanted to give it to
the one I'd spend my life with.
You still carry your grandma's
last memento in your pocket?
It's not so.
You tend to have your heart broken a
few times by the time you reach this age.
This is its third copy.
Third copy or the fourth copy,
it should be its last copy.
You are absolutely right.
Keep it, dear.
Granny!
- Take it.
Let's go.
The function is about to begin.
Come on, lets go.
The function is about to begin.
""Madam's Indian,
but follows western fashion.""
""Her words are often coated
in honey and then some.""
""She moves in style,

Well, don't you look good?
Indian princess, huh?
So, was this your wedding?
No, it is my... it
is my cousin's wedding.
We apologize for disturbing you here.
We stopped by your house first.
But you weren't there.
We cannot have this conversation here.
I have your number.
I will call you. You please go.
I'm not going anywhere
without my money.
You ran off with 32,000 dollars,
it's been fifteen days.
With interest that's 40,000
So we might as well
round it up to... to 50,000.
Look, I lost all that
money you know that.
I don't have any
money right now but...
But you're asking me for 50,000.
Why should I give you 50,000?
You came and gave me that money!
I did not ask you for that money!
And now you are coming
to my relative's house...
I'm sorry.
I should've not
run with your money.
But I don't have any money right now.
I'm not asking, I'm telling you.
50,000, in 10 days.
Today's function went off well.
So many people attended it.
- It's just showoff.
They love to flaunt it to the society.
- They spent a lot.
They sent tickets and invited
so many people from India.
It was fun.
Did Praful tell you she
isn't buying the house?
No, she asked me to
talk to you for the money.
Why?
The other day she said
that she had the money.
Now why does she need the money
when she isn't buying the house?
I don't understand
what this girl is up to.
Papa...
I want to discuss something with you.
Tell me.
I need some money.
I'll return it.
But right now,
I need your help.
Why do you need the money?
I told you, I want to buy a house.
- Don't lie, Praful!
You are lying!
Your granny told me that
you aren't even buying a house.
Then why are you pretending
to buy the house?
To extract money from me?
Yes?
Where are you going?
Answer me!
Tell me!
She keeps on lying
that too to her father.
I wonder why God gave me such a child.
What is this?
The electricity bill is still here?
You don't have the
money to pay the bill!
But you have money
to go out and have fun!
Makes me angry to call you
my daughter.
Kumud, take the money
for the bill out from her bag.
What?
Didn't you hear what I said?
Take the money from her bag!
Do it or I'll throw
you both out of the house.
I am fed up of all
this nagging and bantering.
Here.
This is all your doing!
I've had it with you two!
Praful!
Praful!
Is this yours?
What is it doing on the guest's bed?
I don't understand how many times...
Praful, what is going on?
Praful, talk to me.
Praful, do want to discuss something?
I have problems. Sorry.
What problems?
Just come back to me
and I'll solve them all.
Praful...
So... wow.
I miss you so much, Praful.
Mike...
- I promise...
Mike!
- Praful...
You better concentrate on your work.
Hello.
- Hey, how's it going?
It's declined.
It's declined, lady.
- Wait, it works.
It worked a few hours back.
- Well, it's not working now.
Let me try one more time.
It's declined.
- I pay cash.
Fine.
Hey no! Get that off of there!
Come on lady, I don't have all day.
Hurry please.
I had put money in this bag.
Then find it please.
Lady! Come on, I don't have all day.
- I have put it in this bag!
Lady...
Lady, what are you doing?
Get off the floor!
I've put money in this!
- Listen, it's fine...
I put money in this bag!
Jesus... It's fine.
It's just money, calm down.
I put it in this bag
and now it is not here!
Hey, calm down. It's just money, lady.
Hold on, I'll get you some water.
Jesus.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Hey!
Shit!
Good afternoon.
What can I do for you today?
Okay, okay.
You got any preference of bills?
She's gotta bomb!
Joyce! Phyllis!
Someone just tried to rob us.
I... I think she had
a bomb strapped to her.
Oh, I almost died.
Hello, Mr. Bugs.
Hey, you got my money?
Yes. I have your money.
Where can I come?
Do you have all my money?
Right now I have 10,000.
But...
Who the hell do you think I am?
A vacuum cleaner salesman?
There ain't no installments witch!
I want the whole 50,000 dollars!
- For that I need one month.
Hell no!
You got ten days!
Mr. Bugs?
- You hear me? Ten days!
What?
I think I've kept my top
in your cupboard by mistake.
I'm just taking that.
Go. I'll get it for you.
Move aside.
What treasure are you hiding inside?
Where is it?
Mummy, I don't have
any privacy in this house.
Where... Ah.
Found it.
Look Praful, I don't like
locked doors and locked cupboards.
You don't hide anything
from your family.
Do you understand?
Praful...
Listen... please help me out today.
I need to go to Asif's school
to pick up his report card.
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay. No problem.
Eleventh's west wing, right?
- Yeah.
Okay, okay. Coming, coming.
'In today's headlines:'
'A heavily armed woman robbed the
Barret Goodrich Bank of Atlanta.'
Praful... heard that?
'The cashier visibly
shaken by the episode...'
'...described her as heavily
armed and dangerous.'
'She had a bomb.'
Look how they are robbing banks in broad
daylight. - 'I couldn't see her face...'
'FBI is on a lookout for a petite
woman olive skin possibly Asian.'
'Heavily armed who used a peculiar note to
rob the Barrack Goodrich Bank in Atlanta.'
What was peculiar about
the bank robber's operation..
..was that the note
was written with a...
'Brace yourself... a lipstick.'
Oh God!
'And I was so scared.'
'I almost died in there.' - To buy bombs is
nowadays as easy as buying groceries.
'I don't want to stay
in America anymore.'
Now our money is not
even safe in the bank.
Look how they use
a lipstick to rob banks!
""She is agile.""
""She has attitude."" ""She is restless.""
""She can steal the sky
within a blink of an eye.""
""Known, yet unknown...""
""A little crazy.""
""She makes everyone go crazy.""
""She complicates the dilemma of the
heart and mind while simplifying it.""
""Who knows where you'll go next.""
""Who knows where you'll go next.""
Hey guys, this week I am going
to teach you how to rob a bank.
Step One: Find yourself
the right bank.
She's little too much
a little too little...
A tempting danger...
Incomplete stories and empty pockets...
Still dreams big...
Attracting like a magnet...
She hides them in her fist...
With her deep eyes...
Whenever she look at someone heart.
Step Two: You have to find something
with which you can spook the cashiers.
""Who knows where you'll go next.""
Once the cashiers are spooked,
you don't have to do anything.
You just get the money.
You walk into the bank empty-handed.
And you walk out of the
bank with a sack of cash.
""Who knows where you'll go next.""
""Who knows where you'll go next.""
So robbing a bank is as
easy as making a cup of coffee.
After everything that has
been happening in the world..
..everybody is afraid of a threat.
And we can use that.
So, on next week's tutorial:
How to kill somebody
and not get caught.
Ever.
Praful!
Yes?
- Praful!
YES!
Come here!
Praful!
Praful, come inside.
Yes? What is it?
Hey, what are you wearing?
Jogging suit.
You are anyway so slim.
Don't do any jogging,
the glow on your face will disappear.
Tell me quickly, what is it?
I'll get late.
Instead of jogging let's
join a yoga class together.
I'll get late.
At least that won't take
away the glow on your face.
Can I go, mummy?
Go Simran, go.
No boy can love you more than he does.
Go, my child.
Go to your Raj.
Go, Simran.
Go, live your life!
- Go Simran, go.
Live your life!
- Go, my child. Go!
Simran! Praful!
Get curd on your way back!
I am making 'Thepla'
(flatbread) for breakfast.
Hey! How are you?
Come come come,
have a seat, have a seat.
How can I help you today?
Sit sit sit, come on.
My name's Veena Malik.
And I can help you today.
How's it going?
- Good.
Do you have an account with us?
- No.
No? Well,
zero balance account is fantastic.
By the way,
I love the color of you hair.
It's gorgeous!
So what's your name?
Simran?
Simran! Now that's a beautiful name.
Simran!
Simran, can I have your ID please?
It is in the car.
- Okay. No problem.
Why don't you get your ID from your
car and I'll get a form started for you?
Okay.
- Okay?
Great! Fantastic!
I'll see you in a little bit.
- Okay.
Alright, I'll see you.
""That's Simran!""
""Hobbledehoy Simran!""
""Who knows where you'll go next.""
""That's Simran!""
""Fly away Simran!""
""Who knows where you'll go next.""
Many dreams dwell in her eyes.
Many dreams...
They keep flying aimlessly.
Peeping out through the eyes.
This poor helpless
mind filled with dreams.
""That's Simran!""
""Hobbledehoy Simran!""
""Who knows where you'll go next.""
""That's Simran!""
""Fly away Simran!""
""Who knows where you'll go next.""
""Hey Simran!""
7000! Bloody misers!
'She was terrifying.'
'She had olive skin.'
'She had sharp features and...and...
explosives around her waist.'
'She was middle eastern.'
'Definitely,
definitely trained by Al-Qaeda.'
'The suspect is believed
to be Asian or Middle Eastern.'
Why are they always Muslims?
Papa, what do you think,
why do only Muslims do such things?
Dear, it's the caste and the religion
which sets a person's mentality.
It is not her caste
or religion's fault.
The fault lies in her upbringing.
Mummy, that means
she had a bad upbringing.
Yes. - Hundred percent.
I can give it in writing.
Her father must be useless, right?
Hundred percent.
I can give that too in writing.
He must be totally useless!
- 'Armed and extremely dangerous.'
'Witnesses have reported she's wearing
a jacket equipped with explosives.'
'We can also tell you at this time she's
writing notes with red lipstick.'
'Those lipstick notes
are in evidence..'
'..and being examined for poisons
and other biological hazards.'
That's all for now.
What all have you brought?
I've brought 'Handvo', 'Fafda'
and 'Ghatiya' (Gujarati snacks).
And some lemonade too.
Lemonade's a waste.
Look there, they are drinking beer.
Do you always go
out with your uncle and aunt?
No, it's not so.
I don't have any other way
to meet you.
You know how many phone
calls I made to your father?
He must be fed up!
Why didn't you ask me for my number?
I don't know.
- Shall we sit here?
Yeah, sure. Please.
You are a good boy.
You go meet the girl
with your guardians.
You wear tailored pants and shirts.
You are simple, decent Mr. Right.
Don't get fooled by my dressing sense.
I agree that my dress
sense isn't great.
But you'll be accusing
me if you call me simple.
Oh really?
Okay then prove otherwise.
I've been expelled
from college, twice.
People still talk about
me at Banaras University Campus.
I had to shoulder a lot of
responsibilities at a young age..
..hence I had to finish
college and take up a job.
When one has to shoulder
responsibilities at a young age..
... he might look fine from outside...
... but he comes a little
hollow from inside.
When I see you, I always ask myself...
How can someone be
so complete in oneself?
To see you breathe also seems
like an achievement in itself.
You hardly know me.
I believe that you can
never completely know a person.
Because it's human nature to change.
Change is the only constant.
I believe that you shouldn't
try to understand relationships.
You should just be true to them.
I agree that you can never
completely understand anyone.
But you can at least
try to know a person.
Who am I? What is my nature?
Do I have a character flaw?
I believe that I am a very
progressive kind of a person.
Yes, even I would want my
partner to be loyal after marriage.
But if you had any boyfriends
or if you still do..
... then that won't make
any difference to me.
Having boyfriends
isn't a character flaw.
To have boyfriends is a talent.
I am talking about
real character flaws.
Bad habits?
What do you mean?
I mean...
How do I tell you?
Try taking a guess.
Tell me.
I think...
I... I'm nervous.
Look straight ahead.
Okay.
I'm going to tell you, okay? - Okay.
I'm addicted to gambling and stealing.
You are so funny!
What did you say?
Addicted to gambling and stealing.
You have a great sense of humor.
How are you today?
Okay.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
John! John! Oh, my God! Are you okay?
I'll get a refill for your inhaler.
Please.
I'm... a single parent. Please don't...
- It's okay. I can go to another bank.
'She was about 5'6'',
5'7"", olive skin, purple hair.'
'She even gave me her name in fact.'
'What name did she give?'
'I think Simran.'
'Simran it was.'
'Meanwhile at J&R Federal
Bank near Griffin Georgia.'
'A teller has been rushed
to the county hospital.'
'The threat of Simran, the lipstick
bandit rendered him unconscious.'
'While not critical,
he's currently under observation.'
'And we await updates from
the hospital on his condition.'
Hello, Mr.Bugs?
Hey, hey!
I'm glad I didn't have to remind you.
You wouldn't have liked that.
Where can I come with your money?
I'll come to you, baby.
Bugs will go anywhere for his 50,000.
I am falling short of eight thousand.
- No-no-no-no.
You don't wanna do that.
I need all my money.
Then I need two more days!
Listen! - Two more days!
Please? Please.
Did I disturb your makeup session?
What's the hurry?
Your shift began an hour ago.
Everyone else is here to do your work.
Shall I send anything for you?
Green tea, juice?
What do you want?
Go and get juice.
Don't use your sarcasm on me, Mike!
Lower your voice when you speak to me.
And you don't act so bossy!
I work for the hotel industry.
Not for you!
Praful!
Sameer! - You know,
I was just thinking about you!
What are you doing over here?
I'd come to withdraw some cash.
And you?
I was...
...Preparing to rob the bank.
Are you prepared?
You are so funny.
Come on, rob the bank later.
I'll treat you with
a nice cup of coffee first.
No, I...I am getting late.
I have to leave.
Five minutes. Just five minutes.
Come on.
Would you like to
see my favorite place?
Weren't you getting late?
So what?
I'll do 15 minutes
extra overtime. Just for you.
Whatever you say!
How did you like this place?
It's very beautiful.
Do you come here alone?
Yes.
You mean all alone?
What else does alone mean?
I mean this place is so quiet.
And you aren't one of
those who can keep quiet.
What do you do here?
That's a secret.
If you find out, you'd lose your life.
But I have seen the place.
So I've lost half my life?
What will I do with the other half?
You might as well take that too.
Come here.
Breathe the fresh air. Feel it.
This air is totally free.
No building can stop it.
No obstacle can bind it.
When I come here,...
... I feel tiny wings sprouting out...
... like that of a butterfly...
And then they start flapping.
Can you see my wings?
Yes.
They are big.
I flap them and then I fly away!
Don't jog.
People come here only to fly.
""It's like my blank
heart found poetry.""
""It's like love has showered
like rain for the first time.""
""What I looked for in every eye..""
""I found that loyalty in you.""
""You are my life.""
""I know that.""
""You are my companion.""
""You are my love.""
""The one my lips cannot stop singing...""
""You are that song for me.""
Authorities are working diligently
to identify this female suspect.
We are trying to determine
if she is working alone..
..or if she is a part of
a larger organized crime syndicate.
The public needs to be aware.
This suspect is considered
armed and extremely dangerous.
Witnesses have reported she's wearing
a jacket equipped with explosives.

Where is my money?
Where's my money, huh?
Get up!
Where is it?
I told you I'd come for my money
Oh, my God!
- I told you!
Security!
Where is my money?
Where is it?
Where is my money!
I told you I'd come for my money.
Where is my money!
- Who the hell are you?
No, this bitch owes me money!
- Stand down!
She ran away with 50,000
dollars of my money!
This is our personal matter!
This is our personal matter...
I'll meet you outside my house...
With your money...
Please?
You cannot bring your
personal matters here.
I have to report to the manager.
But nothing like this happened
from my end in last seven years.
Please don't suspend me.
If you do not vacate
the premises immediately...
Forget suspension, I will sack you.
Sir...
- Now, to be clear, one last time..
You are suspended without
pay for three months.
And you should consider
yourself lucky.
For anyone else,
I would've not been so lenient.
Sir, please...
- Ms. Patel!
The next step is I call security,
do you understand?
Praful! What happened, Praful?
Is something missing?
- Where is my money?
We didn't touch it.
- Where is my money?
Which money, Praful?
I'd kept some money here. Here...
Who...
- Which money?
Who opened my locker?!
We don't have the key to your locker.
Only admin has the master keys.
No one can get anything
without Mike's sanction.
Mike... yes, Mike.
Mike...
- Praful!
Mike, where is my money?
You don't enter a
manager's office without...
Where is my money?!
Which money?
The money you stole?
Mike!
Mike, I am going to kill you!
Mike...Mike give my money.
Give my money!
- You b*tch!
Mike!
- Oh shit!
Hey! Security!
Mike, give my money!
- Hey! Somebody help!
Give my money!
Security!
- Give my money! Give my money!
Security!
Send somebody here, quick!
Give me my money!
- Get off!
Mike! Mike! Give my money!
- Get her out!
Mike, give my money!
Leave me, Leave me! - If she
comes back I'll have her arrested.
Mike, give my money! Mike! Mike!
Leave me, leave me!
Okay, leave me, I'll go on my own!
Praful!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Try this 'Ghatiya'
from Rajkot. - Okay.
It's a very tasty snack.
- It's special.
Very nice.
Hello, dear.
Hard day's work?
She works very hard.
She gets tired, poor girl.
Praful!
Freshen up and come out.
Mohan, the kids have
made their decision.
What should we do next?
Whatever you think is fine.
I'll call up the priest at Nathdwara and
ask him to suggest an auspicious hour.
If they want an engagement
then we'll get them engaged...
... or else get them married.
No, sister. I'd suggest
we get them married immediately.
What do you say? - Uncle,
I wanted to say something to you.
Actually, I've got into
UC Davies university. - Okay.
It's one of the good
universities in California.
We will have to shift
there after our marriage.
I have spoken to Praful.
She'll try if she can
get her job transferred there.
We just need your permission.
No problem.
Daughters are meant to be sent away.
She's all yours!
On that note,
try the 'Gulab Jamuns' (sweets).
I am coming out.
12th is a Friday.
- Check when's the full moon day.
Full moon day, I think 20th or 21st.
- Full moon day will be an auspicious day.
We'll also have to talk to Kaushal.
I had the money! Somebody stole it!
No more lies b*tch!
She is not lying. She had the money.
Isn't that right, Simran?
You had the money.
Simran?
You called us after every heist.
I thought she was dumb, Bugs.
She's smart. She is very very smart.
Far too talented to be
wasting her life cleaning rooms.
You think she can work with us?
You're vicious.
Join us, make millions.
I don't want to make millions.
I just want to return your money.
Then stop using lipstick
notes and start using this.
Get it all in one go.
Be our Robin Hood.
- Hell ya!
Robin Hood?
- Robin Hood.
You rob from the rich...and
help us poor people out.
'Coz you outta options baby,
the cops are onto you.
I will get your money.
Who were those people?
Who were they?
How does that concern you?
What is wrong with you?
Why are you talking like this?
I just asked who were those people?
Just because we smiled,
laughed together for a few days..
.. you started
owning me?
What do you mean?
We are going to get married, Praful.
So it is important that we
know everything about each other.
You want to know everything?
Those guys were my friends.
When I lost all my money gambling,
they gave me a loan.
And I started robbing
banks to repay that loan.
Sameer!
Auntie is asking what will you have?
'Gulam Jamun' or
'Raas Malia' (sweets)?
They are both fresh.
Give me a minute, uncle.
What?
Got scared, Sameer?
How much do you owe them?
50,000 dollars.
That's your MBA fees.
What happened Sameer,
why did you run away?
Sameer?
Let me finish, Sameer!
After that the stolen
money got stolen.
Let's go, uncle.
Where?
- Please let's just go.
Where do you want to go?
- Let's go, please.
What happened?
What...? At least tell me.
Come with me, please.
Come on.
- What happened? Say something.
Bye, auntie.
Bye, uncle.
Bye, Sameer.
Hope to never see you again.
Why did they leave?
They didn't leave, papa.
I made them leave, papa.
What do you mean?
Why did you make them leave?
We were preparing
for your wedding, Praful!
I don't want to get married.
Why did you say yes to
him if you didn't want to get married?
Like I had said yes, I'm saying no!
Mohan!
- Papa!
No, don't!
- Praful!
You will raise your hand on me?
Come, hit me.
Do it.
Get out of my house. Now!
Praful! - Get out
of my house right now!
Praful! - Go!
It doesn't make any difference to me.
Praful...
- Let her go. I don't care!
Calm down, Mohan! - Get out!
""Pour down...""
- What are you doing, Praful?
What are you doing?
""Come and drench me.""
- Why are you packing your bag?
Mohan?
She is leaving.
""Pour down...""
- Praful... Don't take
what your father said to your heart.
""Come and drench me.""
- He only wants what's the best for you.
""Pour down...""
""Come and drench me.""
""Pour down...""
""Come and drench me.""
Hello, Salma? Can I ask for a favor?
Can I stay with you for tonight?
Just for tonight.
Okay thank you, thank you.
Hey, Lipstick Bandit!
I am coming to Vegas
with your money tomorrow.
I am waiting for you
with baited breath, my love!
I don't have a place to stay.
Can you...
Oh, I can arrange a new name,...
... a new place, a new identity...
How do you like the name... Shakira?
""By the sand on the shore...""
""Lie still my footprints.""
""It caressed them and went away...""
""It gave a hug and then flowed away.""
""Your unhurried course...""
""Your minuscule stillness...
""You are...you are the one, my love.""
""Oh wave, stay back.""
""Stay back.""
""Or let me drown myself in you.""
""Stay back.""
""Stay back, please.""
""Or let me drown,
yes please let drown.""
Yes? Can I help you?
Do we have an appointment?
Oh dear lord!
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
You don't have to do this.
You just tell me
what I can do for you.
Do you remember me?
You said people like me don't borrow,
we steal.
So here I am to steal.
Move!
I'm sorry, if I said that.
That's not what I meant.
Take me to the cashier!
Nobody move!
Ask him to put all the money in this.
Hurry!
How much is this?
Around 90,000 dollars.
- Just give it to her.
Hello?
There is a transaction
in my account right now.
I want to reverse the transaction.
How to do it?
I... I cannot come to the bank. I...
I am not here on Monday!
No, he cannot...he can also not...
Hello? Praful?
You gave my account number to Sameer?
Yes.
Sameer had called up.
Your father asked him why
he needs your account number.
But he didn't say anything.
Why did you give him my account
number without my permission?
What's going on, Praful?
I just don't understand anything.
You are upset with your father, right?
Why are you upset with me?
Where are you?
- I'm leaving the city.
You're leaving?
Praful, you should have at least...
Praful?
I want to meet you right now!
You transferred 50,000
dollars into my account?
That was the money
meant for your studies, right?
What are you trying to do?
You think you're a saint?
I don't want any favors.
Favors are given when
someone expects something in return.
I don't expect anything in return.
And I am not trying to be a saint.
I did what I thought was right.
And you should do
what you think is right.
Sameer!
What are you doing?
You are a very nice guy.
Don't get involved
with a girl like me.
You will get into trouble.
I wish you all the best.
Have a nice life.
I think you should surrender.
What is it, mummy?
Where are you going?
Cat got your tongue now?
Apologizing to your family, to your
elders, will it make you any smaller?
- Praful...Praful, listen...!
She refuses to understand!
I had rejected her loan application.
She asked me if I remembered her.
And I... I couldn't place her.
Praful? - Then she said that
I suggested that she steal.
I'm just a bank employee.
We can't go distributing
money to everyone who asks for it.
There are rules.
- Yes, of course there are.
You've done nothing wrong.
Copy that.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Come on guys,
you didn't have to do it here.
I would've come to the station.
Everybody's watching.
Come on! Not so tight! This is...
Stop here.
On this side. Here.
Here?
- Yes.
Thank you.
Hello, police helpline?
No, no, no I don't need help.
I want to help you.
You are looking for Simran,
The Lipstick Bandit?
Don't shoot!
Are you Simran?
The Lipstick Bandit?
Are you Simran?
Keep your hands up.
Keep your hands up.
Are you strapped?
No, no.
- Do you have a weapon?
Yes.
- Okay slowly...
Slowly put the weapon on the ground.
On the ground.
Hands in the air.
Do not move.
Stand still.
Stand still.
You are the Lipstick Bandit?
Yes.
I have the money... - Stop.
Don't touch anything.
Why run if you are going to surrender?
Because that neighborhood
is full of Indians!
All my relatives live there.
If my father sees me getting arrested,
he will kill me.
Let's go or he will find us.
Are you serious?
Let's go.
Let's go.
Mummy, you should bring
more 'Dhokla' (snacks).
I'm keeping the 'Khakra'
(snacks) for my friends.
Eat to your heart's content, dear.
And what are these
friends have you made here?
You better stay away
from bad company.
Cool down. Calm down. Eat peacefully.
There are only four months left, dear.
You've already spent six months here.
These four months too shall pass.
When you get out of here,
forget the past and start afresh.
I have decided that you'll
be a partner in my business.
You should start working in the shop.
Anyway, what's mine is yours.
Papa, you don't have
to worry about anything.
I have planned everything.
You have become old.
We will sell your shop and
invest all your money in stocks.
I have made a friend, Sue.
Her bad luck that she got busted.
Mummy, I tell you,
she's a stock market genius.
What did you say?
I won't spare you!
- Mohan! Let her go!
Hi, I'm Maniben.
Hi, I'm Maniben.
Hi, I'm Maniben.
Shakuntala Kanta's
elder sister insane.
Get married said my dad...
Or your grandma will
be on the deathbed.
Get married. Get married. Get married.
Don't they have anything else to do?
Diwali's gone, Holi's here.
Diwali's gone, Holi's here.
Postpone my marriage,
I told my family here.
I want to stay single!
Let me stay single.
Papa, I want to stay single!
Let me stay single.
I'll make you Dhokla.
Let me stay single.

The movie starts on a stormy night in Bangalore. A large tree branch falls and breaks the roof of an apartment. The woman inspecting the outhouse ends up in a hospital.

In another town, the woman's daughter, Sanjana, and her husband, Kabir, argue about not being able to celebrate her birthday together. Sanjana gets a call about her mother's accident and they quickly fly to Bangalore.

In Bangalore, Sanjana begins having visions that make her believe her dead conjoined twin's soul is after her. Her husband does not believe her and sends her to his former professor for spiritual healing.

During the treatment period, she tells the professor about how her conjoined twin sister Anjana always hated that Kabir liked Sanjana more than her. In fact, it was when Kabir told Sanjana that he was coming back home from abroad that Sanjana decided to separate from Anjana. It was during this operation that Anjana died, and Sanjana blames herself for her sister's death. The professor reassures Sanjana that her visions of Anjana are the result of her guilt and only a figment of her subconscious mind.

At her mother's place that night, Sanjana is forced into the outhouse by an unseen entity. Hearing noises, Kabir wakes up and finds her unconscious in the outhouse. When Sanjana awakes, she is possessed by Anjana's soul. After this, Sanjana/Anjana can't get enough of Kabir. When the professor meets her again, he feels there is something wrong and tells Kabir to keep an eye on her, which she overhears.

The caretaker suggests that a ritual should be performed on Sanjana/Anjana. After the ritual, Anjana's stronghold on Sanjana escalates and her true colors are shown, resulting in an exorcist being called in.

During the kanjar, Anjana reveals that she was murdered. As she leaves Sanjana's body, she urges Kabir to discover the truth of her death. After Sanjana wakes up, Kabir threatens to leave her. Sanjana tells him that years ago when he called her to tell Sanjana that he was coming home, Anjana lost her mind and tried to kill her because she had feelings for Kabir too. In self-defense, Sanjana hit Anjana on the head with a glass music box, killing her. Their mother covered the truth to protect her daughter. After consulting with the professor, they try to find and burn the last possession of Anjana and set her soul free.

Sanjana, Kabir, the caretaker, and her daughter-in-law all follow the music leading to the outhouse. Under the floor, they find Anjana's corpse. The caretaker and her daughter-in-law go inside to get kerosene with which to burn the body. They both die at the hands of Anjana's soul. The professor arrives at the outhouse with kerosene, but is possessed by Anjana and tries to attack Sanjana. While Kabir fights him, he finds the locket he gave to Sanjana when they were young on Anjana's corpse. When he confronts Sanjana, she confesses that she is actually Anjana. She tells him that she killed Sanjana with the music box and took her sister's place so she could be with Kabir. Outraged, Kabir decides to leave her despite her pleas that she loves him. Sanjana (now revealed to be Anjana) hits him on the head with a chair to stop him from leaving and he falls. Anjana tries to kill Kabir with a pair of scissors but is stopped by Sanjana's soul, the burning roof falls on Anjana thus killing her and professor saves Kabir. Kabir sees Sanjana's soul smiling at him and then disappearing in the fire.",3450,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt4271730.srt","The tune..
You remember the tune?
Hey baby. I'm on the way.
Shall we meet directly
at the restaurant?
Sanjana, I am sorry. We'll have
to cancel today's dinner plan.
I have an important meeting
with a client.
I can't miss it.
Baby, it's my birthday.
We can at least
have dinner together.
Sanjana, we can celebrate
your birthday tomorrow.
This meeting is important.
I really need to go.
I'll see you at home.
And yeah.. Happy birthday.
Happy birthday to me.
Happy birthday!
Surprise!
- Anu! Oh my, God!
""Happy birthday to you!""
""Happy birthday to you!""
""Happy birthday, dear Sanjana.""
""Happy birthday to you!""
- Thank you.
Thank you so much, Anu.
It's so sweet of you.
Don't thank me,
thank your husband.
He's organized all this.
Kabir?
But he's busy with some client..
- He knew he'll be late.
That's why
he organized this party
and called us all here.
Come on. Cut the cake before
your birthday gets over.
Cut my birthday cake
without Kabir?
Never.
Sanjana! It's hard to say
who loves whom the most?
You both are mad.
Absolutely crazy.
Honestly, you two
make me really jealous.
By the way, Sanju,
meet my cousin Chitra.
Hi.
- Happy birthday.
Thank you.
I am sorry for coming
here uninvited..
Are you mad?
You're most welcome.
- Thank you.
Sanju, she's an expert
tarot card reader.
If there's anything you want
to know anything about yourself.
Here she is.
She knows everything.
I hope you don't mind.
I don't believe in these things.
Why learn about
yourself from others?
And I've got everything.
And I'm doing good.
Of course you are.
But don't you want to know
whether you'll have
the fortune forever?
You always end up losing
everyone you love
or is close to your heart.
Do you agree?
Right or wrong?
A bit of both.
Have you lost something?
Strange, because
this card indicates that
you're going to find
what you lost.
Maybe someone's coming back.
""The moon's missing
from the sky.""
""And descended in my home.""
""I am so fortunate""
""like my wish has
been fulfilled.""
""My love, I can't live
a moment without you.""
""Desire to have you
has made me crazy.""
Kabir, I want us
to spend time together.
I've told you
a thousand times before.
I don't want nothing
and no one between us.
Just you and me.
But you can't live with me.
There's always some surprise,
or party or people..
And then there's your career,
your meetings, your job.
Sanjana, you wanted
to flee from Kerala, right?
You wanted to come here.
To start a new life.
A better life, better lifestyle.
Isn't that what we
needed to be happy, right?
But for that, one has to work,
stay apart for a while.
I don't want to stay apart.
I don't want this.
I just want you.
Your time, your company.
Am I asking for too much?
Fleeing from Kerala didn't
mean that we grow apart too.
What do you want me
to do, Sanjana?
Quit my job and stay at home to
assure you nothing has changed.
Everything...
Everything is still the same.
Or let's go to Kerala?
Would you like that?
No.
The root of this problem is
this place. Let's just go back.
No.
Neither that city
nor that house.
That place is littered
with Anjana's memories.
Everywhere.
I won't go back to Kerala.
No.
Hello.
Okay.
What happened?
Mom's in the hospital.
We'll have to go to Kerala.
You okay?
Yes.
I cannot forgive myself.
I am really selfish,
right, Kabir?
Not at all.
Not at all.
If I hadn't insisted
for an operation
then Anjana would've been..
- Sanjana.
It wasn't you,
it was the operation.
No one wants
to be born like that.
No one wants a life like that.
It was an accident. A mishap.
Not selfishness.
Look, she suffered
a serious blow to her head.
She's paralyzed neck down.
She can't speak or walk.
Also, there's a blood clot
in her brain.
We found it in her MRI scan.
We may need to operate her.
Thank you, Doctor.
Sanjana.
Come on, Leo.
Yes, I'll take that.
Thank you. - Okay.
Shall we?
- Yes.
Five!
Anjana.
Sanjana?
Are you Mangala?
Yes, I..
How are you?
I'm okay. And you?
I am fine.
It's all right.
Some ups and downs.
How's madam?
She's being treated.
It's serious.
Who's she?
She's my daughter-in-law, Jaya.
- Hello.
My son's biggest mistake.
They got married
three months ago.
So I brought her here,
to work with me.
I see.
Do you know
what happened that day?
That accident?
I have no clue.
But there was a big storm
that night.
It was such a fierce storm
that the ceiling
of the outhouse collapsed.
Madam was lying outside
the outhouse, unconscious.
Outhouse?
Why do you always
keep it locked?
Why don't you open it?
How can we, sir?
It's been closed
for seven years.
I've been working here
since five years.
I asked madam once, and she said
this was Sanjana
and Anjana's playroom.
After Anjana's death,
Sanjana locked this place.
She said, this place is
filled with Anjana's memories.
Her toys, and..
And Anjana too.
- Mother!
What nonsense! Anjana too!
Please open it.
Sir..
- Get the key, please.
Thank you.
- Let's go.
Who is it?
Kabir!
Oh, God! You scared me.
And you amaze me.
What are you doing here
at 2 o'clock in the night?
Kabir, I.. I heard some noises.
What noise? Are you crazy?
Really, Kabir.
I heard some noises
and came to inspect.. - Sanjana.
If there were any sounds,
I'd have heard them too, right?
You didn't hear anything?
- No.
Come on.
- Kabir, trust me.
I heard some noises.
It must be coming
from some other house.
Come on. Let's go back
to sleep, come on.
Mr. Kabir.
- Yeah.
There have been
some complications.
We need to operate
on her immediately.
I think you should get her
as quick as you can.
What?
'Paging for Sister Parvati.'
'Sister Parvati please report
to ward 5.'
'Sister Parvati please
report to ward 5.'
Yes, Mohit, go ahead.
What?
No, Mohit,
you can't take a leave.
Kabir!
Sorry.
Buddy..
Mohit, firstly I am
not in the office.
And now you want a leave too.
Those are very
important clients.
Somebody has to be
there to handle them.
Who will do it?
I don't know. I am stuck
in this goddamn place.
Why did all the mothers have to
fall ill at the same time?
I just don't understand..
I'll call you back.
Sanjana, I am sorry.
I didn't mean that.
Sanjana.
I am sorry.
Actually, I am quite
stressed because of the work..
Just go, Kabir.
Don't worry about me.
I'll handle everything
here, alone.
And anyway,
what will you do here?
Just go.
I wanted your support,
not your favor.
Come on, Sanjana. You're making
a big deal out of this.
I am not going anywhere.
And I won't go until
mom doesn't recover.
But I will stay distracted..
I can't help that.
I know that.
I am used to dealing
with my problems alone.
To keep my emotions to myself.
For God's sake Sanjana,
all I said was..
Excuse me.
The operation was successful.
But you can't meet
your mom right now.
In the meantime,
you can complete
some hospital formalities.
Please. Thank you.
- Okay.
Thank you.
I'll take care of it.
It's all right. I'll do it.
Sanjana,
I said I'll take care of it.
Kabir!
Namit sir? You?
It's..
I can't believe it.
How are you?
- Good, sir. Good.
But you tell me this.
You just disappeared for years.
No contact or anything.
What are you doing here?
I mean what are you doing here?
- Hey!
Catch your breath first.
Well.. After seeing you,
I feel perfectly all right.
You haven't changed at all.
Still the same.
Looks and wits.
What are you doing here
at this hour?
Well, sir, my mother-in-law's
admitted in this hospital.
You don't worry,
she is in safe hands.
This is a very good hospital.
And then I am there.
Let me know if I can
be of some help. I'll do it.
Thank you so much, sir.
I know.
But first tell me
what are you doing here?
I am a psychologist
in this hospital.
And I also run a Healing
Institute in Kottayam.
Healing Institute?
- Yeah!
These days I do everything.
Spiritual healing, etcetera.
I have students, I also teach.
Keep my card.
- Thank you, sir.
I.. I will call you, sir.
Sure?
- We'll definitely meet.
Yeah! Okay.
You take care.
Okay?
It was nice seeing you, sir.
- Same here, Kabir.
Kabir. Kabir.
I saw her in the lift.
- Saw who?
She's there.
- Who? Who's there?
Can I say something?
Will you believe me?
What is it?
She's here, Kabir.
I can feel her.
Feel who?
Anjana.
Sanjana, please.
We're educated people.
Don't talk like
an illiterate woman.
Kabir.
How long will it
take to fix this?
Three to four days.
Excuse me.
Oh! Maximum three to four days.
Oh.. Okay.
Please get the work started.
- Okay.
Leo!
Leo!
Leo!
Where did he go?
Leo!
Leo!
Statue!
Statue!
I am sorry to say
but your wife
has had a miscarriage.
Kabir.
I told you.. I had told you,
she's in this house.
Kabir, she's trying to harm me.
Kabir, please believe me.
I saw her last night.
Kabir.
Last night,
in the courtyard downstairs..
We've had a miscarriage!
We lost our child!
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
I wanted to.
But I was scared.
I didn't want to nurture
a deformed baby.
Like Anjana and Me.
Whether deformed or abnormal
but it would still have
been our baby.
You hid such a
big truth from me. Why?
You were drifting away from me.
After the child, you would've
drifted further away from me.
Kabir, the truth is that
I can't stay away from you.
I can't let anyone
come between us.
Between us?
What madness is this?
And children don't create rifts.
They fill the void, Sanjana!
You could've done it too.
You've totally lost it, Sanjana.
And it's all in your head,
not in this house.
Because it's completely empty.
It's filled with negative
thoughts, fear and illusions.
There's.. There's nothing here.
- Kabir.
And look at the consequences.
We lost our baby.
- Kabir.
Sanjana dear..
My mother once said to me
if you keep a knife
under your pillow
you won't see dream
about ghosts and evil spirits.
Will you try that?
Yes.
Here.
Kabir.
Kabir, I..
- What?
You're bleeding.
Kabir, I..
- Who, Sanjana?
There's no one here.
You've lost your mind.
She..
I am sorry.
- Yeah whatever.
I am going crazy.
I am sorry.
I am sorry.
I am going crazy.
Okay.
I am going crazy.
- I'm sorry. Okay?
Kabir.
Help me. Please help me.
Kabir.
So Sanjana, tell me something
about your childhood.
What do I say?
I have so many
childhood memories.
So many untold stories.
Who were you closer
to in your childhood?
Your mother or father?
My sister, Anjana.
Anjana.
- What?
We'll never separate.
Promise?
- Promise!
So why did you
two decide to separate?
That..
Okay, okay, okay.
Stop.
Enough for today.
We'll continue in
the next session. Okay?
Now, relax.
- Okay.
Kabir.
It is a very delicate case.
We need to handle
it sensitively.
She's been through a lot.
Sister's death,
her miscarriage.
Mother's accident.
For sometime
believe what she says.
But, sir..
- Listen to me, Kabir.
Just agree to what she says,
what she thinks.
Don't fight with her.
Even if you don't believe.
Get it?
Yes.
Another thing.
I think she needs a break.
Take her out, in the open air.
Let's see if staying away from
this house makes a difference.
Where have you brought me?
Ready?
- Ready.
Kabir, this..
This is a dream,
where there is you, me
and no one else.
This is your time.
Not even mine.
I am really sorry, Sanjana.
I didn't try to understand you
and left you alone.
Please. It was my fault too.
I wanted to impart love
instead I just became
a burden on you.
I always thought about myself.
I should say sorry, Kabir.
- Enough.
We're done apologizing.
Please forget everything.
Kabir, what about mom?
If there's an emergency,
the doctors will call us.
I've taken care of it.
Trust me.
And your trip to Mumbai?
Changed your mind?
Yes.
- ""It says..""
I changed my mind
about going back
and returning to you.
""Let's spend those days again.""
""Brought me close to you,
made me restless.""
""Made me crave for you!""
""Made me crave for you!""
""Lost control..""
""Lost control..""
""Lost control..""
""My heart's lost control.""
""Lost control..""
""Lost control..""
""Lost control..""
""My heart's lost control.""
""Gives rise to desires
in the first rain.""
""Makes the heart beat faster.""
""Restless by nature,
calls out to you.""
""Makes me cry when you're away.""
""And no matter how I try""
""it's impossible to pacify.""
""Brought me close to you,
made me restless.""
""Made me crave for you!""
""Made me crave for you!""
""Lost control..""
""Lost control..""
""Lost control..""
""My heart's lost control.""
""Lost control..""
""Lost control..""
""Lost control..""
""My heart's lost control.""
""Let's wander
in those lanes again.""
""Where the breeze
of love always flew.""
""Why don't we meet
like strangers again?""
""And introduce
each other once again.""
""And lose my heart again,
after meeting you.""
""Brought me close to you,
made me restless.""
""Made me crave for you!""
""Made me crave for you!""
""Lost control..""
""Lost control..""
""Lost control..""
""My heart's lost control.""
""Lost control..""
""Lost control..""
""Lost control..""
""My heart's lost control.""
What happened?
What happened?
- Kabir..
That hand..
It was a hand..
Kabir.. Kabir..
- There's nothing.
It's nothing.
'It didn't make a difference,
sir.'
'She thinks Anjana's
following her everywhere.'
Sir, it's said that,
if one of conjoined twins die
the other doesn't live
for too long. I know..
I know this is all a..
- Hold on.
You will have to understand
that Anjana and Sanjana
were connected together
even by soul,
not just physically.
Don't you see?
Maybe due to fear,
but they're still together.
They haven't separated.
Sir, I agree you're right.
But Sanjana's problems started
after we came to Kerala.
Do one thing.
Consult the doctor and see
if Sanjana's mother can be
shifted to a hospital in Mumbai.
Yeah, I can do that.
Did you fix the roof?
- Yes.
Have you done it properly?
- Yes, madam. I've done it.
Mangla. Lock the doors.
Sorry, madam. I forgot.
I'll lock the door.
How could I forget?
Doc, I just want to know
if we can shift her to Mumbai.
It's important for me to go.
And I'll get her treated.
Mr. Kabir, forget treating
her at Mumbai
she is not in a condition
to travel.
Sorry. I can't take that risk.
- I understand.
When was the first time
you met Kabir?
Sanjana, I'm going to
London for higher studies.
London? But why didn't
you tell me this earlier?
And now suddenly..
- After my parent's divorce
dad shifted to London.
He got me admission
in the Leigh University.
So I have to go.
- But for how many days?
Not days, but years.
Won't you come to the airport,
to see me off?
Of course I will.
I will see you there.
Okay, bye.
- Bye.
Kabir's going to London,
for years.
He's called me to the airport.
I don't want to go anywhere.
Anjana, let's go please.
- No.
Anjana, please.
- No!
'Anjana, let's go please.
- No.'
After that it was difficult
for us to stay in touch.
'I could neither write
a letter or an email.'
'Nor call him.'
Anjana!
Anjana, please give it to me.
'Even mom didn't want us
to be together.'
'So she would hide
the letters he wrote to me.'
'Maybe.'
'Time went on.'
'Kabir had been away
for 10 years.'
And one day.
Hello.
- Hi.
Kabir, is that you?
Guess what?
I am coming back.
To you.
You're coming back. When?
I can't believe this.
I am coming back soon, Sanjana.
And this time you'll have to
come to the airport
to receive me.
I don't know how,
but you will have to come. Okay?
Yes, I will come.
I definitely will.
No one can stop me this time.
Good.
Okay, I'll have to go now.
I'll.. I'll see you soon.
Okay.
- Bye.
Kabir is coming back.
And he wants us to receive him.
Meet him.
You can meet him, not me.
Anjana, stop being so obstinate.
We're no longer kids.
I want to meet him, Anjana.
He loves me
and I love him so much.
This time I will meet him,
Anjana.
Even if it means
separating from you.
And that's when you decided
to separate from Anjana.
'Yes, it was my decision.'
And I blame myself
for her death.
Yes, I killed her.
If that's true
then you still have no reason
to feel so guilty.
It's not wrong to
think about yourself.
Sometimes it's not a crime
to be selfish either.
You're human being, not God.
I was trying to be God.
Made a decision about
someone else's life.
She could've lived her life,
still be alive
but I took away her life.
But she's back now.
She's following me.
She wants to take me with her.
Sanjana. Sanjana.
Please try and understand.
It's the after-effect
of her death
which you're still
carrying along.
Your fear
is nothing but the burden
on your heart.
The day you stop
blaming yourself
you will stop seeing
Anjana as well.
Kabir!
Sanjana!
Sanjana!
Sanjana!
Sanjana!
Sanja..
Sanjana!
Sanjana!
Sanjana!
Sanjana!
Sanjana!
Sanjana!
Sanjana, wake up.
Wake up.
Sanjana,
what are you doing here?
Kabir!
- W-Why are you here?
I don't know, Kabir.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Kabir, I am scared.
Enough, Sanjana. Stop crying.
- Please help me.
That's enough.
Enough.
Calm down. Calm down.
Stop it.
Isn't one ghost enough
in this house?
Oh mother-in-law! Does your
TV only air horror movies?
I told you a thousand times
there's no such thing as ghost.
But you..
Madam said it for
the sake of her child.
The sister said for
the sake of her sister.
So why won't you believe it?
Mother-in-law,
everyone has a soul
in their body.
Once the body perishes
the soul won't come back.
Oh God! You confuse me
if I'm inside
or outside the body?
Oh God! Forget it. Go make some
breakfast and serve it to them.
Go.
Inside or outside the body?
What are you looking at?
- You.
Because I want to.
So I am looking at you.
What else do you
feel like doing?
I feel affectionate.
There are so many things
in my heart.
I want to say everything.
So then what's stopping you?
Stay with me forever.
Sanjana, I have to go.
Go
but come back soon.
I promise.
Mother-in-law! Mother-in-law!
What is it?
- Mother-in-law!
I saw Sanjana madam.
She was lying on the floor
in the outhouse
clutching on to her
sister's clothes and toys.
And when I went closer
she stared back at me
as if she was possessed.
Enough about ghosts and spirits.
Hold this.
Mother-in-law..
Mother-in-law. Believe me,
I'm telling you the truth.
Keep quiet, keep this plate.
Take a look.
Please come take a look.
Why did you drop
the plate on seeing her?
What were you thinking?
Sorry, madam, I..
- It's all right.
It happens.
Next time, focus on your job
and not the people
in this house.
Okay.
You..
Sanjana.
Sanjana.
Sanjana.
This..
No one can love you
as much as I do.
And no matter how
many times I say this
it's not enough.
No matter how much
I express my love
it's never enough.
Sanjana.
No one will come between us now.
It's just you
and me.
What's the matter, Sanjana?
Something's different about you.
What?
Don't know.
There's something different
but whatever it is
I don't want to go
away from it.
""Embrace me in you.""
""Don't leave any
part of me in me.""
""You don't remember
who you are.""
""I don't remember who am I?""
""Come embrace me.""
""And let me hide you
in my arms.""
""I'll trickle drop by drop.""
""And stay on your body.""
""I'll trickle drop by drop.""
""And stay in you.""
""Empty the river""
""fill me with it.""
""Let me drink you up.""
""Quench my thirst.""
""Bring some clouds.""
""And make them shower on me.""
""Let me drench you with drops.""
""You don't remember
who you are.""
""I don't remember who am I?""
""Come embrace me.""
""And let me hide you
in my arms.""
""I'll trickle drop by drop.""
""And stay on your body.""
""I'll trickle drop by drop.""
""And stay in you.""
""I'll trickle drop by drop.""
""And stay on your body.""
""I'll trickle drop by drop.""
""And stay in you.""
I'll go see the doctor, okay?
Okay.
Mom.
What happened?
I don't know.
She was trying to say something.
I don't know what happened.
Yes, everything is fine.
I mean, is there
anything to worry about?
No, there's nothing
to worry about.
Thank God we reached on time
otherwise anything
could've happened.
So, how's Sanjana now?
- She's much better now, sir.
What do you mean?
- I mean..
The guilt about Anjana.
The nightmares, depression.
It's..
It's all gone.
Disappeared.
And I just want
to thank you, sir.
You're the reason
I found my old Sanjana back.
Thank you so much.
Coffee.
Hi, Sanjana.
- Hi.
Sorry, excuse me.
Yeah, Mohit. Tell me.
Divya was talking about you.
She said, 'We must invite
Kabir and Sanjana for lunch'.
Well, that's not
my bloody problem.
I said, 'Good idea,
let's plan it out today'.
Just send them
the logistical plan and..
She was also planning
on watching a film.
But..
But, there must
be an alternative.
I am sure there's
something you can do.
Your husband is a busy man.
Tell them, we are..
You must feel lonely, right?
Seriously, Mohit,
I can't handle it.
I know.
I know your mother's ill,
but until I come back..
Hello.
- You must handle it.
You know this project
is very important for us.
We cannot afford to
make any more mistakes.
Sanjana.
And the requirements from their
company, please update..
Sanjana!
I am sorry.
I'll make the coffee.
- No. I'll make it.
And, did the customs
release the shipment?
Are you okay?
- Yes.
I'm absolutely fine.
After a decade,
I am finally happy.
Thank you.
Sorry, sir, it was an important
call. Couldn't avoid it.
Leo, shut up.
Shut up!
Shut up!
I wonder what's wrong with Leo.
He suddenly got violent.
He barked at Sanjana.
I think he needs
counseling as well.
Kabir, this is serious.
Animals can see
what humans can't.
It's called
Extra Sensory Perception.
It's weird that he
got violent like this
on seeing Sanjana.
Maybe he sees
the change that you did.
Something isn't right.
Sir..
Such drastic change in
such a short time is not normal.
Such people hide things.
They have too many things
on their mind
but they don't reveal it.
They want people to
consider them normal.
but, they are actually not.
Sir..
Sir, I don't understand.
Watch her.
Keep an eye on her.
And keep this between us.
Help.
Help! Kabir!
- Sanjana.
Kabir, help me!
Help me.
- Leo!
Leo, stop it.
Leo. No, Leo.
- Help me, Kabir.
No, Leo.
Mother-in-law! Mother-in-law!
Mother-in-law!
Mother-in-law.. - Why are
you shivering in this weather?
Are you sick?
- I won't work in this house.
You won't work here? Why?
Mother-in-law,
I am scared of Sanjana madam.
Scared of Sanjana madam? Why?
I was collecting my purse
and that's when looked
out the window..
Help!
Help. Kabir, help me!
Help!
Kabir, help me! Help me!
Help!
Kabir, help me!
Kabir!
Leo!
Kabir!
- Leo!
Leo, stop it.
Leo! Leo! No, Leo!
Help me, Kabir!
I don't know, sir.
I don't understand.
I mean..
There's always something
happening in this house.
One thing's over
and another spring's up.
I just don't know what to do.
Sir..
Yes, Mangla. Tell me.
Sir, I don't know
if you'd believe me.
But someone's cast
an evil eye on this house.
With your permission
I'll conduct veneration
in this house.
And everything will
be fine after that.
Okay.
Sanjana.
Just like there are
two kinds of human beings.
Similarly,
there are two kinds of spirits.
Good and bad.
Bad spirits often
possess weak bodies.
Trouble them.
And later, kills them.
The way your wife's getting weak
she's getting seriously ill
it proves that she's possessed
by her sister's spirit.
But she won't
posses her for long.
Soon, she will kill her.
We have very little time.
Hail the Bhoot Puran
(Book of evil)!
Lord have mercy on us.
This Bhoot Puran was
been written by ascetics
thousands of years ago.
We can use the chants written
in them to control the spirit.
Destroy all the
belongings of her sister.
Cover every glass in this house.
Mirrors, photographs,
everything.
Because, as soon as
I start chanting
the spirit will leave her body
and try to hide in these things.
And this shouldn't happen.
I've covered all the
corners of this house
so that the spirit
doesn't leave.
The spirit has to be
destroyed right here.
Once I start chanting,
it will lie, try to distract us.
She'll try to scare us.
But we'll have to be brave.
Cover her face.
Kabir!
Kabir, help me!
Kabir, help me!
Kabir, they are hurting me!
Kabir, help me!
Kabir!
Leave me.
Help me!
Kabir, help me!
Help me!
No one can stop me!
Let her go.
You don't belong to this world.
Go back to wherever
you came from.
I didn't go there
but I was sent there.
She killed me.
Now I will kill her.
I will kill her!
Shut up!
Go away or else
I'll turn you to ashes.
Go!
Find the truth.
You'll get me out of her body
but, how will you get me out
of this house?
She killed me!
Killed me!
She killed me. Took my life.
Try to find the truth.
The truth.
The spirit is out of her body
but, she's not in my control.
She's still somewhere
in this house.
You okay?
My head's aching.
The effect won't
wear off so soon.
What happened with me, Kabir?
What happened?
Sanjana's returned
to me after a long time.
Let me you in my arms first.
Then I'll tell you
what Anjana did to us.
'She killed me. Killed me.'
'She took my life.'
Did Anjana's truth scare you
or Sanjana's lie?
What do you mean?
What's all this?
All I got was lies, so I thought
I must lie to know the truth.
Stop talking in riddles.
Be clear.
Even I am trying
to solve the puzzle.
Tell me what you did?
Who did you kill?
What was the lie
you always told me?
Tell me, Sanjana!
I never lied to you.
You didn't lie to me, but you
didn't tell me the truth either.
Anjana's spirit is
still in this house.
And she won't leave you alone
until you don't speak the truth.
Sanjana,
I don't want to argue with you
or raise my voice.
It's even your responsibility
to keep this relation intact.
Now the choice is over.
The truth might not
keep us together
but a lie will
definitely shatter it.
Okay, Sanjana.
Your silence has
conveyed your decision.
But Sanjana, everyone
has to pay for their deeds.
You'll have to pay for yours
and I will repent
for loving you.
Kabir, stop.
I will tell you the truth.
Please don't leave me.
I love you very much.
Please don't go.
I will tell you everything.
Please don't leave me.
Please don't leave me.
I will tell you everything.
Please.
Kabir is coming back,
and he wants us to receive him.
Meet him.
- You can go, not me.
I will meet him
this time, Anjana.
Even if I have
to separate from you.
Kabir doesn't love you.
He just wants to separate us.
So he's pretending to love you.
Otherwise,
what else could be the reason
that he loves you instead of me.
What's wrong with you, Anjana?
Have you lost your mind?
He only loves me.
He thinks of you
as a good friend.
You snatched Kabir from me.
You came between us.
Because I know he loves me!
And I love him!
That's not true.
Kabir loves me, not you.
No? Then I'll make sure,
he only loves me.
Anjana!
Anjana!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
'That day mom saved me'
'because it was an accident.'
I didn't want to kill her.
I was only trying
to save my life.
Sanjana, why didn't
you tell me this before?
Because I didn't
want to lose you.
I'm so sorry, Sanjana.
I didn't know
that my love for one sister
would be the cause
of death for the other sister.
Remember this.
Anjana loved you very much.
And I love you.
So sorry, Sanjana.
This means Anjana's spirit
is here to take revenge
and, she won't leave
without doing so.
There's something Anjana's
spirit is tethered to.
Before she attacks Sanjana again
you'll have to find
that thing and burn it.
What happened?
Sanjana, he says
something in the house..
Come.
It's coming from here.
Anjana!
Mother-in-law..
We'll have to burn
this body right now.
Go get kerosene.
Walk faster.
Mother-in-law..
Come on.
Let's go.
Mother-in-law.
Jaya! Jaya!
Mother-in-law!
Mother-in-law!
Mother-in-law! Mother-in-law!
Mother-in-law!
Why are they taking so long?
I'll take a look.
Thank God you're here, sir.
We found Anjana's dead body.
We just need kerosene..
- Here.
You have the kerosene?
I found this when I went
in the house. I.. - Okay.
You should never
try to fool spirits.
Kabir!
Kabir!
Kabir!
Hide and seek?
Sanjana! Burn her body.
Go! Go!
Kabir..
Kabir!
Kabir!
Kabir!
Kabir!
Kabir!
Kabir, are you okay?
Kabir!
What do I call you?
Sanjana or Anjana?
Kabir, what are you saying?
What do I call you?
That's Sanjana's body, isn't it?
No, Kabir.
I am Sanjana.
That's a lie!
How many times
are you going to lie?
Please, tell me the truth now.
Tell me the truth.
Kabir..
- Tell me the truth.
Tell me the truth.
No? Then I'll make sure
that he only loves me.
Mom, please.
From now, I am Sanjana.
I could not help it, Kabir.
I loved you like crazy.
I wanted you.
I couldn't live without you.
You couldn't live without me..
but, you could kill your sister.
- No.
Our relationship, our marriage,
it was all a lie. - No.
All these years I was deceived
because, it was all a lie.
- No.
Your whole existence
is nothing but a lie.
- No, Kabir.
Don't say that.
What's the difference
between me and her?
We were both the same.
Then why didn't you love me?
Having the same face doesn't
make you the same person.
People are always different.
Kabir.
And like you said
no one can replace anyone.
Kabir. Kabir..
That moment, that day,
that year.
All the time that
we spent together.
Don't they have any importance?
Every time you said you love me.
Isn't that worth anything?
Say it, Kabir.
- No.
It's worth nothing.
Because I always loved Sanjana.
When I was close to you, I was
not with you. And you knew
that you had taken
Sanjana's place.
Not yours.
Fine, then give me my place.
Forget her and accept me.
This locket.
Adorn this locket on me,
like you did to Sanjana.
Do it.
- Anjana.
Do it, please.
- Anjana.
There's place for only
one person in the heart.
And no one else can take it.
Nor the moments together or
the nuptial rounds.. - Please.
Kabir.
- Nor did we breathe together.
So just let it go.
Because this..
Kabir.
...and me
belong to someone else.
Kabir!
Kabir!
You can't leave.
You can't leave.
I won't let you go.
I won't let you go.
Say you love me.
Say you love me.
Say you love me!
Say you love me!
Say you love me, Kabir.
Say you love me!
It was always about Sanjana.
You never knew how much
I loved you.
If you can't be mine
then no one else
can have you either.
You can't be anybody else's!
Kabir!
Sanjana!

A poison gas attack on a Kolkata Metro Rail compartment kills all the passengers on board. Two years later, Vidya Bagchi, a pregnant British-Indian software engineer, arrives in Kolkata from London during the Durga Puja festivities in search of her missing husband, Arnab Bagchi. A police officer, Satyoki ""Rana"" Sinha, offers to help. Although Vidya claims that Arnab went to Kolkata on an assignment for the National Data Center (NDC), initial investigations suggest that no such person was employed by the NDC.

Agnes D'Mello, the NDC's head of human resources, suggests to Vidya that her husband resembled former employee Milan Damji, whose file is probably kept in the old NDC office. Before Agnes can provide any further help, she is killed by Bob Biswas, an assassin working undercover as a life insurance agent, at the entrance of her house. Vidya and Rana break into the old NDC office and find Damji's file, barely escaping an encounter with Bob, who is sent to search for the same information. Meanwhile, the attempts to obtain Damji's records have attracted the attention of two Intelligence Bureau officials in Delhi—the chief Bhaskaran K. and his deputy Khan. Khan arrives in Kolkata and reveals that Damji was a rogue IB agent responsible for the poison gas attack. Despite Khan's warnings, Vidya continues her search, fearing that Arnab's resemblance to Damji may have led him into trouble.

The address on Damji's record leads Vidya and Rana to a dilapidated flat. An errand boy from the neighbourhood tea stall identifies R. Sridhar, an NDC officer, as a frequent visitor to Damji's flat. Bob attempts, but fails, to kill Vidya and is soon run over by a truck during a chase. Examination of Bob's mobile phone leads Vidya and Rana to an IP address, sending instructions to kill her. They break into Sridhar's office to verify his IP address, but he is alerted electronically and returns to his office. Vidya accidentally kills Sridhar during a scuffle, which upsets Khan, who had wanted him alive.

Sridhar's computer data reveals a code, which when deciphered reveals Bhaskaran's phone number. Vidya calls Bhaskaran to tell him that she has retrieved sensitive documents from Sridhar's office. She asks Bhaskaran to help find her husband in exchange for the documents, but Bhaskaran tells her to contact the local police. Vidya soon gets a call from an unknown number, warning her that she should hand over the documents to the caller if she wishes to see her husband alive. Khan thinks the caller is Damji.

Vidya goes to meet Damji at the designated location as told in the phone call, followed by Rana and Khan. Damji cuts the meeting short when Vidya expresses her doubt that he will be able to return her husband in exchange for the sensitive file, and he attempts to leave. Vidya tries to stop him, and in the ensuing struggle, Damji draws a gun on her. Vidya disarms him using the prosthetic belly she has been using to fake her pregnancy and promptly stabbing him in the neck with her hairstick before finally killing him with his own gun. She flees into the crowd before the police arrive, leaving a thank-you note for Rana and a pen drive containing data from Sridhar's computer, which leads to Bhaskaran's arrest. Rana concludes that neither Vidya nor Arnab Bagchi ever existed and that Vidya had been using the police and the IB to achieve her own ends.

Vidya is revealed to be the widow of Major Arup Basu, an IB and Army officer and Damji's colleague, who was killed in the poison gas attack, which also caused Vidya to fall unconscious upon seeing her husband's corpse and suffer a miscarriage. In her mission to avenge his and their unborn child's deaths, Vidya was helped by the retired IB officer, Col. Pratap Bajpayee, who suspected the involvement of a top IB official.",3815,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt1821480.srt","Park street.

The door is closing.
Hello.

Which bag?
Speak louder.
Which bag?
Next station Ravindra Station.
Platform on the right hand side.
Why is she crying so much?
She's hungry.
Why don't you feed her?
I forgot her milk bottle at home.
Yesterday I bought a new game,
Call Of Duty: Black Cops.
What a game. Great graphics.
Look, there's Kushal.
Kushal, why are you so scared.
Give it. Give the bag.
Why are you scared?
What are you hiding in your bag?
Is it something special?
What are you hiding in your bag?
Give the bag. Give the bag.
What are you hiding in your bag?
I will go back home.
Come on. Come on, let's go.
Show me the bag.
Hey, you left your bag behind.
The milk bottle is right here.
More than 100 are
expected to be dead..
...in Kolkata Metro Rail due
to the deadly gas attack.
Its believed that a terrorist
group is behind this attack.
Even on the third day passengers
are hesitating to travel by the Metro.
The relatives of those..
...who died in the gas attack
staged a rally in Kolkata today.
And requested the government..
...to find out who is
responsible for this attack.
Madam.
Madam.
Madam. Madam. Come with me.
Who are you?
What do you want?
Move, move.
Move, move.
You shouldn't lift heavy
objects in such a condition..
Move. Go away.
You shouldn't lift heavy
objects in such a condition.
Let me, let me.
Leave it. - I know, I have a kid too.
Let me, madam. Please.
Move aside. Move.
You are taking my passenger.
Madam, please come with me.
Please move.
Don't mind, madam. But
can I ask you something?
I have been driving a
taxi for the past 15 years.
Every passenger either goes home
or to the hotel from the airport.
You are the first passenger who is
going straight to a police station.
Get the tea quickly.
Press any key.
It's up, it's up, it's up..
Here it is.
It's here.
It's working!
It's shut down again.

That's what his wife
must be saying every night.
Sign here.
Madam, here's the police station.
How much?
Here's your bag.
Madam, this is my number.
If you ever need a taxi, call me.
Thank you.
Where do I go to file a
missing person's report?
Yes, you go...
Just go straight.. I mean,
it's just straight ahead.
Thank you.
Shall I carry this?
Thanks. - It's okay.
My husband is missing.
Are you coming from out of town?
London.
You arrived just now?
Yes.
Madam.
We will need some details.
Actually, a month ago.. - Tea.
Will you have tea?
No.
Yes, go ahead.
- He came to Kolkata a month ago.
He had a two week assignment
in the National Data Centre.
Okay. - First two weeks
we would talk every day.
Then he suddenly stopped calling.
No messages or anything.
And I didn't know what to do.
So I came here directly. I..
Speak softly.
Doesn't my time have any value?
Why are you screaming? No need
to shout. He can hear you clearly.
Your name.
Vidya Bagchi.
Bidya Bagchi.
No, it's Vidya. With a V.
Madam, in Kolkata Vidya,
Bidya .. same feelings
Isn't it, Rana? - What?
Vidya, Bidya are all
the same, isn't it?
Your husband's name?
Arnab. - Bagchi?
Arnab..
Stop messing with it Rana
Sorry.
And age?
33.
Complexion.
Wheatish.
Height?
A little taller than this.
Do you have a photograph? - Yes.
Doesn't my case have any value?
Doesn't my case have any value?
-Softly. Softly.
What softly? - You will speak softly
or else I will throw you out.
He is listening to
what you are saying.
Love marriage.
Is this a year old?
No, two years.
Don't you have a latest one?
No.. Arnab didn't like
to get his pictures taken.
'Isn't it enough that we
ran away and got married?'
'Now we have to get a picture
taken as well."" - Come here.
Otherwise what's
the proof that you married me?'
It was the day we got married..
...so I forced him to
get our picture taken. - I see.
What does your husband do?
We both were software engineers.
Firewall experts. - Firewall?
We make programs to save
computers from virus attacks.
Like, the police..
protects the public. Right?
Get this done quickly.
Arnab was supposed to come to London
after the assignment, but he didn't.
He suddenly vanished.
Vanished? - Yes,
I mean no messages, no calls.
And Arnab isn't like that.
Where was he staying here?
Mona Lisa, 172A
- Sarat Bose Road.
The place where he worked name?
- National Data Centre.
Yes.- But they said that Arnab
never came there for any assignment.
He did, I know.
We talked every day.
He would call me a thousand
times in a day and I would scold him.
So that he doesn't spend his
entire earning on the phone bill.
But I don't know why they are lying.
The case is slightly complicated.
I will do my best. It will be done.
It will take some time.
I will get it done.
Madam, you will need to sign this.
Sign, sign.
Why are you after that thing?
Leave it.
May I help?
You? - Oh yes,
you are a computer person..
Take a look.
What a pain..
You just needed to clear some memory.
You won't face any problem now.
Are you satisfied now?
Now, madam, you just need to
sign and you're free to go.
What happened, madam?
Sit, sit.
Would you like some water?
Will you call a taxi for me, please?
Why, Taxi? Rana will drop you.
Rana, go drop her. Go.
Come.
How much further?
Its close-by.
Are you feeling better now?
Is this your first visit to Kolkata?
Yes.
Entire Kolkata is getting
ready for the Puja, right.
So you know about ""Durga Puja'?
I have a Bengali husband remember..
By the way, your name Vidya is
also a very common Bengali name.
Vidya.
I know.
Courtesy Mr. Chatterjee.
By the way, why do they call you Rana?
Your name.. The name
tag reads Satyoki.
In Kolkata everyone has two names.
One is 'Dak' name, which is
pet name like mine is Rana.
And the other is
'Bhalo' name, official name.
Satyoki.
But everyone
addresses me by my pet name.
Interesting. Two names
for the same person.
Two identities.
Satyoki. Arjun's charioteer.
Guesthouse?
Have we reached the hotel?
Mrs. Bagchi, this
doesn't look like a hotel.
Are you sure this is the place?
That's the address.
Why would your husband stay here?
I don't know.
Come.
Good evening. Are
you the manager here?
Yes.
I am Vidya Bagchi. I had
called you from London..
...about my husband Arnab.
Yes, yes. Arnab Bagchi.
Your Majesty, you..
- Look, I am not the queen.
You can call me Vidya.
Bidya madam, when you
called from London..
...I told you that your
husband wasn't staying here.
The situation is
still the same. Arnab..
You've been saying
that all the while..
...and that's exactly why I came here.
I know this because he would
talk to me everyday from right here.
Sir, please explain to her..
- Wait, wait.
Mrs. Bagchi, maybe
there's a confusion.
There's absolutely no confusion.
Arnab was staying here.
This man is lying.
Show me your records.
Register. Get the register.
This.
Are these your records?
Yes. - Don't you have a computer?
Computer? - Madam, only 5-star
hotels have computers.
This is a guesthouse.
0-star.
Arnab stayed here
and I can prove that.
If you walk towards the lift..
...there's a peacock statue there.
Arnab used to say that..
...The peacock of Tamil Nadu
has followed me here too.
Which way is the lift?
That way.
Is it or not? - There is.
Then? - There is a peacock.
But your husband isn't here.
I mean, he wasn't.
- You think this is a joke?
The peacock's really there.
But how do you know? - Exactly.
If Arnab didn't tell me
about it, then how do I know?
I don't know why everyone's lying.
What, sir? Talk to me.
Arnab wasn't staying here, right?
But I will.
I will stay in room no.15.
Mrs. Bagchi, are you sure.
I am absolutely sure.
Will you give me the key?
Sign here.
Here?
'My dear wife, Why are
you standing at the door?'
'You are so late'
'I've been waiting for so long
even your phone was unreachable.'
'And what if I hadn't returned?'
'Then I would've kept waiting..'
It started raining suddenly.
Business is down.
Absolutely. - Exactly.
Your maj.. No.
Good morning, Bidya madam.
Its Vidya, not Bidya.
V, not B.
Whatever you say, Bidya madam.
There's no hot water in the room.
I know. - You.. You know.
Then why did you put up a
board saying 'Running hot-water...
That?
I tell you.
Bishnu. Bishnu.
Come here. Come here.
Come.
Madam, he's Bishnu.
If you want hot
water then call Bishnu.
He will come running
with the hot water.
Running hot water ..our Bishnu.
How do I go to Camac Street?
You will get a bus, or a taxi outside.
Bishnu, show madam.
Come Didi. - Come on.
What is that? - Don't ask for that.
That's his radio. His life.
He will never give it.
Come on.
You called me Didi right?
So that makes my brother right?
Give me a five, brother.
Good morning, sir. - Good morning.
Please call Mrs. Bagchi.
Madam left for Camel street.
Hi. I am here to meet Agnes D'mello.
Do you have an appointment? - Yes.
Your name, madam?
Vidya Bagchi. - Bidya Bagchi.
Nothing.
Bidya Bagchi.
Darling, I told you this
when you called me from London.
Your husband didn't come to
my company for any assignment.
I am the HR manager.
I approve every assignment.
And I didn't sanction any
assignment for any Arnab Bagchi.
Arnab.
No. He didn't come here.
He did. I sent him.
'I don't want to go to Kolkata.'
am on a holiday.'
'It's just a question of
two weeks, I'll be okay.'
'You're crying like a girl'
'You are actually packing my bag.'
'Wifey, please. They
will find someone else.'
'And I will stay right
here and look after you.'
'Cooking, washing.'
'That's what I am afraid of.'
<i>I will be okay, go.'</i>
Please help me Didi..
Please help me.
I don't know what to do.
Yes! - There's a police officer
who wants to see you.
Me?
Bye. - Bye.
Poor girl.
Mrs. Bagchi.
This way.
Show it.
Let it be.
Mrs. Bagchi.
That wasn't Arnab.
Mrs. Bagchi, doesn't Arnab
have any relatives in Kolkata.
Uncle or anyone?
He has an uncle.
He stays in Thakurpukur.
Here Here here (in tamil)
Meaning?
Arnab's school.
Kalagachhia Kailash
Kamini High School.
I see. - I have heard
lot of stories about it.
Rana. That means uncle's
house must be close-by.
Let's go that way.
Rana. I should've worn a sari, right?
Just hold this.
Sari? You wear a sari as well.
Do you have one?
Don't worry, Mrs. Bagchi.
You are looking nice.
Come.
I am meeting them for the first time.
- I know..
Arnab Bagchi. - No.
Then, does any other
Bagchi family live around here?
Look, madam. We've been
living here for the past 30 years.
But we never heard of
any Bagchi family..
...or any Arnab Bagchi.
Thank you. - Who is Arnab Bagchi?
Thank you.
Can you come in, please?
What happened? Been punished?
What is this?
This is a flying swan.
I see, that's a flying swan. - Yes.
It looks more like a dead duck to me.
Okay, see you.
No, dear. There was no
Arnab Bagchi that year.
Why can't I access
Milan Damji's record?
Its showing me Restricted each time.
Madam, I will need Mr.
Tyagi's permission to unlock it
Where is Tyagi?
He's on leave today.
Coming, mother.
Hello. - Agnes.
Yes. - Hi.
Can you meet me tomorrow?
Of course. - At 3 o'clock.
Where? - There's a restaurant
at Park Street.
Mocambo. - Mocambo.
See you. - Take care.
Bye.
Bishnu.
Bishnu!
Coming Didi..
Watch it. - Move aside.
Here you go.
Radio?
Kalighat.
Just a minute.
Rana. Call from the airport.
Hello. - Better explain
to that Bidya Bagchi.
Yes, yes, yes.
- That Arnab or whoever..
...got her pregnant and ran away.
These things keep happening.
Hello?
Tell her not to waste time here in
this condition and return to London.
Oh, so you checked?
I have been thinking about
it for the past 30 years.
But he ran away in 2.
Sorry, can you say it again please.
Would you like a cup of tea, sir?
No, its fine. Thank you.
Hi.
Mr. Das.
Good morning, madam.
Good afternoon, Mr. Das.
Whatever you say, madam.
- Good afternoon, Rana.
Good afternoon.
Radio.
Are you going anywhere?
To meet Agnes.
I will drop you there.
I won't need your
chariot today, Satyoki.
My taxi is waiting.
Okay.
Mrs. Bagchi, we checked..
...with Kolkata and
London's immigration departments.
The date that you told us..
...no Arnab Bagchi left from London..
...or arrived in Kolkata.
Then surely there's a
mistake in the system.
We double-checked it.
Triple-checked it.
The facts are correct.
Yesterday after you left I
took a close look at the photo.
And you know what.
Your husband looks exactly like..
...an ex-employee of ours.
Milan Damji.
Who? - Milan Damji.
He left 2 years ago..
He was a funny one.
He would keep to himself.
He joined suddenly
and even left suddenly.
His blood group was funny as well.
Bombay blood group.
I clearly remember the
day he left the company.
A lot of people came looking for him.
But he vanished!
Poof.
But what is the connection with Arnab?
Two years ago he was in London.
Milan Damji looks exactly like Arnab.
That's why yesterday I tried..
...to get his photo from the computer.
But it would always
show me the same message..
...Restricted.
Restricted. Restricted.
God knows how to
operate these computers!
Tomorrow when Tyagi returns..
Tyagi?
Tyagi here.
Who wants Milan Damji's records?
If I can't access the computer..
...there are some employee
records are in the old office.
Maybe there's a photo in that.
Agnes, thank you but..
What will I do seeing Milan's photo?
Just see Milan Damji's photo once.
Then decide.
Bob.
Bob.
You can't do anything.
The figures are so bad.
You can't get a single
life insurance client.
If this goes on then soon you
will be fired from this job.
For God's sake, switch off the phone..
...and concentrate on your target.
Client, sir.
Disgusting.
Yes.
Hello.
Hello.
Agnes D'Mello.
Yes.
One minute
Oh she wears a wig!
Good morning, sir.
Sir, he's in a meeting.
Gentlemen, we've to
ensure that we do this.
Excuse me.
I've to go to
Kolkata today, right now.
Why? - No smoking
in the building, Khan.
I know. - Someone shot
NDC's HR manager.
So.
That's the local
police station's case.
Why do you have to go
to Kolkata for that?
She was trying to
access Milan's record.
What other information do we have?
There's a pregnant lady,
from London.
Vidya Bagchi.
Listen, on the seventh day..
I need this room empty for a while.
Everyone go out.
What?
Didn't you hear?
I need this room empty.
Who are you?
What is your name? Get out.
- Shut the.. Khan.
That's my name Shut the.. Khan.
Anything else?
No, sir. - Call Vidya Bagchi.
I want her here in 10 minutes.
Okay, sir.
Tell me.
I am pregnant woman, sir.
You shouldn't be
smoking in front of me.
Mrs. Bagchi, we don't
know much about each other.
So leave it to me about
what I should or shouldn't do.
Let's come to the point. Tell me.
How are you related to Agnes?
My husband Arnab Bagchi is missing.
What happened? Why
is everyone outside?
That Vidya Bagchi, it's a big problem.
Really? - Yes.
What are you saying?
Mrs. Bagchi.
What is going on?
Look.. - Who are you?
Look, I am talking to her. - Out.
But who are you? - Out.
Close the door behind you.
Out!
Yes, so what were you saying?
Who is he?
Arnab's face resembles an
ex-employee Milan Damji.
And Agnes.. - There was never
an employee called Milan there.
I feel Agnes got it wrong
Are you sure?
Because I remember correctly..
...that Agnes said Milan Damji.
Mrs. Bagchi, I know more
about NDC than you and Agnes.
2000 employees work there, understand.
I am quite sure.
Yes, she also said that..
...when she tried to
access Milan Damji's record..
...she kept getting Restricted..
- You aren't listening to me.
Are you listening?
There was no one called Milan.
No, inspector I am
sure Agnes said Milan.
Do you understand what I am saying?
There's no one called Milan there.
You are still stuck on Milan.
Don't you understand what I am saying?
Milan. Milan. Milan.
Out!
Look, I..
Mrs. Bagchi. Look here.
I am giving you a free advice,
although I don't.
Get over with whatever you came
here to do and leave for London.
That will be best for
you in this condition.
Do you understand?
Mr. Khan.
We don't know each other..
...So leave it to me about
what I should or shouldn't do.
And anyway, you
don't give free advices..
That's good.
You shouldn't either.
Quiet.
Sir, sorry.
Take all this inside.
Mrs. Bagchi, I will drop you.
Come.
No, no, no. No need to worry, sir.
It's a simple case.
Actually.
Agnes confused her husband with Milan.
That Vidya Bagchi.
Her husband got her
pregnant and disappeared.
No, no, she is completely harmless.
I will get her background checked.
Don't worry at all.
Don't waste time on
that pregnant woman, Khan.
Tell me about Milan.
Give me Captain Bajpai.
Yes.
- For God's sake get a mobile, Bajpai.
Why? Why do I need a mobile?
I stay at home the entire day.
When can you come to the office?
Why?
I needed to discuss
something important with you..
...about Milan Damji.
Hello?
Bajpai?
I'm here, go on.
Can you come to the office?
No.
Rana. If I address
someone by his first name..
...then what does it mean?
That you know him really well.
'There's no one called Milan there.'
'Actually there is no Milan.'
'Milan. Milan. Milan.'
According to Khan,
Milan Damji is someone..
...who doesn't exist at all.
Yet, he said Milan
instead of Milan Damji.
Why?
I am going to NDC.
If I find out anything,
I will call you.
No, sir. There is no
Milan Damji in our records.
How long have you been working here?
Sir, 1 and half years.
And you never heard
the name of Milan Damji?
No, sir. - Sapna, do you..
You?
Sir, he was inquiring about
Agnes D'mello's murder case.
Do you have any authorization?
I am standing right behind you?
Whose name is Rana?
Sir. I am Rana.
Why did you go there?
With whose permission?
Without any permission, or a warrant.
To hell with the warrant,
first tell me..
Why do you have to
conduct a local investigation..
...when this is an IB case?
Next time if I see you following up..
...without my permission.
Then you will be
telling the traffic police..
...about the traffic from
the control room, understand.
No, sir, actually..
- Did I ask you? Did I ask you?
Will you work for the traffic control?
Do you want to work
for the traffic control?
Out.
Who else?
Do you? Out.
What?
Didn't you understand what I said?
Out.
How long have you
been doing service?
Six months, sir.
Do you love your job?
Do you want to keep working?
Yes, sir.
Mrs. Bagchi, I think
Khan sir is right.
Agnes must be confused with someone.
See, NDC has at least
2000 employees.. - Exactly, Rana.
2000 employees work in NDC..
...so why did Agnes
take Milan Damji's name?
She wasn't wrong?
And you know, Agnes
never said anything..
...until she hadn't seen
Arnab's photo properly.
What happened?
Why are those women
wearing such a sari?
Them? - The red and white sari.
They wear it on any auspicious day.
But why?
""White sari with red border?
""Why should I wear that?""
'Why? Why?""
'It's traditional.'
'Everyone wears that on
the last day of Durga Puja.'
'Everyone, even men?'
'I will get you one when I
go to Kolkata, Mrs. Bagchi.'
'And trust me, even
you will look awesome.'
<i>""What?""</i>
<i>""What?""</i>
'Mr. Vidya Bagchi, don't bore me.'
'And drop this stupid idea
of making me wear a sari.'
'Just go to Kolkata
quietly and come back quickly.'
And then I forced
him to go to Kolkata.
He's an idiot as well.
He came here.
He had this bad habit of
doing whatever I said.
I am sure you will find Arnab.
Can I say something,
if you don't mind?
That sari, the one
that woman was wearing.
The day you find Arnab,
you can wear that sari.
That will be the
auspicious day for you.
Arnab won't be found so easily.
I will have to look for him.
That's the point, Mrs. Bagchi.
How will we look for him?
Milan Damji does not exist.
He's some story that
you believe to be true.
Rana.
Agnes said..
'The employee records
are in the old office.'
'There might be a photo in it.'
What are you saying?
How can we barge
inside someone's office?
That too, the National Data Centre.
But it's closed down.
Sapna. - Yes, sir.
Do you have hard copies of
the old employees records?
No, sir. Everything's on the system.
You sure? - Yes, sir.
Sir.
There might be some in the old office.
There's nothing here.
Hello. - Write down, third floor.
Third floor.
12 R.N. Mukherjee Road.
It's the old NDC office.
There's a file on Milan Damji..
Who is Milan Damji?
No one. Just do as I say.
Get the file. - Bob.
Client.
Good.
Let's go.
This one.
Oh, God. That's a big lock.
I can't do it.
Rana. Open it.
How?
Mrs. Bagchi, I am
the police not a thief.
Really?
Open it.
This is great.
The police is breaking and
entering himself. Very good.
There are millions of files here.
How will we find it?
This is not done.
We'll have to look
for the HR department.
I am totally screwed
myself on this one (in Bengali)
Meaning?
I will explain that later.
What's written here? - Same. Xerox.
This door.
Chief accounts. No, no, no.
Rana. H.R.D.
Look there.
If it exists then it
must be somewhere here..
...or it doesn't exist.
If Agnes has said it,
then it must be here.
DE. DH. DU.
DS. DC. DDH.
DA.
Mrs. Bagchi, hurry up. Please.
Just a minute, Rana.
Milan Damji.
There was no file on Milan Damji.
Milan Damji exists.
Who is Milan Damji?
Where did you get this paper from?
What difference does that make?
Who is Milan Damji?
- Is he your husband?
Take a good look.
Is he your husband?
Take a look.
No. - He isn't.
Then what difference does
it make about who he is.
Forget Milan Damji .and I will forget
where you got this paper from.
End of matter.
Milan Damji isn't Arnab.
But he does look like Arnab..
...and if something has
happened to my husband..
...because of that, then it is
very important for me to know..
...who Milan Damji is.
Either you tell me
or you leave it to me.
I will find the answer
and come back to you.
How will you find out?
I will go out and ask every person.
Even if he's a common man
on the streets, the police.
Or the media?
Someone will surely have
an answer to this question.
Sit down, Mrs. Bagchi.
Sit down.
Do you know anything about the attack
on Kolkata Metro two years ago?
Yes.
Milan Damji was behind that attack.
He's the prime suspect in this case.
Then why doesn't anyone
know about Milan Damji.
Milan Damji doesn't exist
for the world, that's why.
He didn't exist for me either.
Until the day I was
given the task to catch him.
But until then it was too late.
Milan disappeared and
so did all his reports.
But how can anyone just disappear?
- It can be our agents.
Milan was a government agent.
He betrayed us. Joined
hands with the enemy.
We have been hiding
this from the people.
Not just that, there's someone
in our system who is helping Milan.
This is a dangerous game,
Mrs. Bagchi.
Those who want to keep Milan
safe are very powerful people.
They can do anything.
Hello.
Madam.
Madam. I am so sorry.
It was a mistake.
Are you alright?
I saved you today.
My reflexes.
What if I can't save you tomorrow?
Oh, God. One
shouldn't think like that.
You and your child should stay safe.
I will pray to God for that.
I will pray to God for that.
Madam.
Madam. Kolkata, dangerous city.
Right?
Anything can happen here at anytime.
I am telling her for her own good.
Go back.
Go back, madam. Go back.
Very dangerous city, Kolkata.
No.
I don't want to come back.
You can have your bureau, your system.
One project.
Just one project failed.
That doesn't mean we
shut down the bureau?
Shut down the system..
- Just one project
How easily you can
say that, Bhaskaran?
Just one project. - You gave me
this assignment, Bhaskaran.
Pick three ordinary guys, train them..
...and turn them into
bureau's best agents.
And what did I do?
I created a monster.
I found two good people..
...but an animal like Milan
Damji got trained as well.
And he joined hands with
those he had to save us from.
He killed the very
civilians I trained him to protect.
We will find Milan,
you just come back.
You cannot find Milan,
Bhaskaran, that's the point.
I trained him. You cannot find him.
Only fools like you
and me can be found..
...who keep ranting
Our system is perfect.
Law has the upper hand.
There is no
corruption in our system.
Everything is hunky-dory.
Bhaskaran.
One man helped Milan Damji to escape.
That man is still
working in your bureau..
...right under your nose.
The day you find him,
that day I will come back.
Rana, three things are possible.
One..
Arnab has left me and ran away.
Two..
Arnab and Milan Damji
are the same person.
And third..
Arnab looks just like Milan Damji..
...and that's why Arnab's in trouble.
That must have happened.
So you are saying that Arnab looks
like him and so.. - I am sure.
We will have to find
Milan in order to find Arnab.
And the day we find Milan,
we will find Arnab.
Mrs. Bagchi, how is that possible?
Where do we start looking for someone
we don't know anything about?
From his house.
Meaning? - I mean Agnes's file had
Milan Damji's home address.
How much further?
Ten minutes.
Sorry.
It must be somewhere around here?
Which way is Bishambar Mallik Lane.
Mrs. Bagchi, this is
Bishambar Mallik Lane.
Didi, where is number 9.
This one. - This one?
Yes. - This is the one. Come.
Number nine. Come on.
You are ok to climb up?
Yes. Let's go.
Carefully.
I don't know which one it is.
There are no numbers.
Nothing's wrong.
Where is number three?
Over there but it's locked. Anything
wrong sir? - Nothing, nothing.
Come.
Here it is.
But it's locked.
I see. Give.
The police is breaking
and entering himself.
You said so.
Wait.
I wonder why anyone
needed to lock this place.
There's nothing here.
And even if there was anything then
Khan must have taken it away.
Mrs. Bagchi.
Mrs. Bagchi. - Yes.
Let's go from here.
- There's nothing here.
Yes, let me take a look.
Mrs. Bagchi, don't do that.
No, no, I am okay. I
will surely find something.
Let's look there.
Did you see, Rana, only flat
no.3 didn't have a letter-box?
Who is it?
Are there any letters for no.3?
There is one.
There in no.9.
Just a minute. - Poltu, come here.
Where are you? - Rana, Milan used
to order tea from here.
Maybe they might know something.
But how do you know?
You offered me tea in a
similar glass in the police station.
See what they are asking for.
Remember, there were two similar
glasses at Milan's house. - Yes.
Now, there was no
kitchen in Milan's home, so..
Didi Poltu.
One minute.
Are you scared?
He is my friend.
What is your name?
Poltu. - Poltu? Pet name or real name?
Pet name. Real name is Subroto.
Subroto, no need to be scared.
So tell me, do you remember anything..
...about the person in flat no.3?
Flat no.3? No. - Anything.
I mean what kind of
a person was he. Short-tempered?
Or would he smile each
time you delivered tea?
Would he say something?
No, he wouldn't say anything, but..
He would order only one glass of tea.
And sometimes a second
person would come to meet him.
That's when he would order two teas.
Yes, there was someone.
Who was the other person?
He would always carry a suitcase.
And the corners looked like gold.
Suitcase?
This big.
Briefcase.
Oh, you look so handsome
when you smile, Subroto.
You can win any
child's heart so easily.
I am completely sure. - What?
That you will be a great mother.
What is this? Donation bills. Nonsense.
He said there's a
letter from the bank.
But this is a blood bank.
People's blood bank.
Bombay blood group?
Rana, Agnes had said that
Milan had a rare blood group.
'Bombay blood group.'
Sir, if any person
has a rare blood group..
...then he stores his blood with us.
So that if there's an emergency..
...then he can use his blood.
I see.
When was blood
required last in this case?
Will you check it and tell us?
Just a wait a minute,
I will tell you. - Of course.
There was a requirement
for this rare blood group..
...on May 2008, 25th May.
And we received a call
from Ekbalpur Nursing Home.
Ekbalpur Nursing Home?
Not a single paper.
No records, nothing.
Must be. It's been erased.
Just like every
other records of Milan.
Mrs. Bagchi, this is a dead end.
Come on, Satyoki.
There must be something somewhere.
I am not going to accept defeat.
After making it so far.
You have always helped me.
I cannot go further
without your help, really.
There's a man who
may be able to help us.
He was once a police informer.
Sorry.
Come.
Careful. Careful.
Are you fine?
Thank you.
Sir, can you tell me
where is Paresh Pal..
Sir?
There. There.
Paresh.
No. I have no
connections with the police now.
But, Paresh, we just
need a small information.
Look, whether the
information is small or big.
I don't give it anymore.
Paresh Please.
Please leave.
If someone sees us then
it will create a problem.
Sir..
I am searching for my husband.
I came from London in
this condition all alone.
I just need an answer for my child..
...that what happened to his father.
I cannot force you,
but.. please help us.
Tell. - Have you heard
about Milan Damji?
Who?
Milan Damji.
Milan Damji. No.
Two years ago, on 25th May..
...Bombay blood group was
required in Ekbalpur Nursing Home.
What for?
We just need to find that out.
Can you do that?
Laundry Didi?
Laundry Didi?
I am not Laundry Didi,
I am Bidya Didi.
Your transistor is giving chocolate.
Such a big chocolate. - So big.
Hello.
You did disturb me, I am
in a important meeting.
In the room with Vishnu.
Really?
When?
25th May, 2008.
Two men had a meeting here.
There was news about only
two people meeting until now.
But now it appears there was a
third person present as well.
And the blood was ordered
from Ekbalpur Nursing Home..
...for this third person.
So, was that third person Milan Damji?
I don't have anymore information.
Paresh..
Wait.
You will find the rest
of the information..
...at Park Street Police
Station or you can find Dr. Ganguly.
That night he was on night duty.
I remember that it was a police case..
...but I don't remember
what exactly it was.
It was two years ago. - Ready, sir.
Yes, I will be there. - Okay.
Give me a day, I will check
and tell you. - Thank you.
I need to go, I have a surgery.
- Thank you.
Don't worry. - Please.
Thank you very much.
Yes.
Dr. Ganguly? - Yes.
Hello. Bob Biswas.
Hello. - Just a minute.
I remember that it
was a police case.'
Stop it Rana.
Your computer is driving
me up the bloody wall.
Mr. Chatterjee.
What? - Hello.
Oh my, God.
Bidya Bagchi.
You arrived at the right time.
Hi, Rana. - You had shut this computer
up the other day, didn't you?
Yes. - Do it today as well, please.
Otherwise I will go crazy.
Thank you.
- I will go meet the senior officer.
Come, come. - Oh, God.
No, no, keep seated.
He can return any moment.
Two people were killed at Nonakpur
Tram Depot on the 25th of May.
One was Dinesh Rao..
...who was a police
informer in the Metro attack case.
And second..
Second was Vijay Verma
who was a government agent.
Government agent?
He's back, he's back.
It's done, sir.
Done, Mr. Chatterjee.
It's done.
That's nice, very good.
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.
Welcome. - Okay.
What is the matter?
Mr. Chatterjee, may I leave?
Yes.
Bye. - Bye.
Yes, mother.
I am coming.
Mrs. Bagchi, what are you doing?
Why are you cleaning it yourself?
Wait, I will call the staff?
No. no, no, no. - Come here.
I do the cleaning myself at home.
Sit. I cannot tolerate dust.
Pull a chair.
Speak, Satyoki Sinha.
Mrs. Bagchi, I
pursued the information..
...acquired from the database.
There is no mention of a
third person in the records.
Dr. Ganguly, Milan Damiyji,
Ekbalpur Nursing Home.
No one knows anything about them.
There are only
records of Vijay and Dinesh.
Vijay Verma was
investigating the Metro attack..
...at ground level.
Really? - That's why he met Dinesh
Raut at Nonakpur Tram Depot.
Maybe Dinesh wanted to tell Vijay..
...something about Milan.
And someone informed Milan about it.
Milan killed both of them and
got injured in the shootout.
But the question is
that how did Milan know..
...that Vijay is going to
receive information about him?
Maybe Khan was right.
There is someone within the system..
...who is helping Milan.
One more thing.
NDC is also involved in this.
- Really?
Mrs. Bagchi, every agent
has a local, a fake identity.
Just like Milan Damji..
...even Vijay Verma worked for NDC.
To hide his true identity.
It must be him, take a good look.
No. it wasn't him.
Now, now, take a look.
No, Didi. That wasn't him.
It's not him. - Are you sure?
Sure.
Come, let's take Poltu back.
I was absolutely sure that..
Tyagi knew that Agnes is
looking for Milan's details.
And Tyagi stopped you. - Of course.
Didi. - What?
The suitcase.
It was him, Didi.
Are you sure? - Sure, it was him.
Who was he?
I don't know.
You take Poltu home..
...I will find out
and meet you there. - Yes.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
Turn around. Turn around.
Didi? - Yes.
Will you have tea? - No.
Listen, when Rana arrives
will you ask him to call me.
The police officer? - Yes.
Okay. Yes, fine.
Bye.
Sorry. - Rana.
I was waiting for you at
the tea-stall for so long..
Blood! - Oh no.
Rana, that's him. He tried to kill me.
Stop. Stop.
Stop.
Move.
Stop. I am the police.
Stop. - Stop.
Stop.
Oh, God.
Mrs. Bagchi, Bob Biswas
was a contract killer.
This is his phone.
And I have found these
photographs in his phone.
Agnes D'mello.
Dr. Ganguly.
And you.
This time you survived.
But the man who hired Bob..
..who doesn't want
anyone to reach Milan Damji..
I gave this photo to Agnes.
Just a minute.
Look.
I gave a copy of this photo to Agnes.
That means whoever gave
Bob the contract is in NDC.
No, no. It means you didn't
hear anything I said until now.
And you don't understand, Mrs. Bagchi.
Your life is in danger.
And I will have to
tell Mr. Khan about this.
Did you find out who Mr.
Briefcase was?
Mrs. Bagchi. - Who was he?
He is Shridhar.
The head of IT department.
Tyagi reports to him.
Rana, we thought that
Tyagi is doing everything.
But Tyagi was only
passing the information.
We have no such evidence.
Come, let's go to the police.
And yes, that phone is a evidence.
Please give it back.
Phone.
Rana look.
Bob has been sent this
message from some website.
So?
Once I hack this
website then I will know..
...whose computer these
photos were sent from.
What, you...?
You are a hacker?
Only in my spare time.
You do know that I am
the police, don't you?
Yes, yes, yes.
Sorry.
This is the IP
address of the computer..
...from where the
photos the photos were sent.
And I am completely sure..
...this is the IP address
of that Mr. Briefcase.
And once that is confirmed..
...then we can find Milan Damji.
No, no, no. Mrs. Bagchi. Mrs. Bagchi.
This matter is very serious now.
And I still say that we
should go to the police.
We don't have time, Rana.
Mr. Briefcase will soon
find out that Bob is dead..
...and then he will try
to erase all the records.
No, Mrs. Bagchi, I..
Please. We just have to
access Shridhar's computer.
After that we will go to the police.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
You think death is a joke, Vidya?
Mrs. Bagchi, I have
told you so many times..
...that your life is in danger.
You even witnessed
everything with your own eyes.
Even after that you
are joking about death.
Maybe because, after Arnab..
...life has become a joke, Rana.
Shall we?
Sapna.
Yes, sir.
You haven't left yet, Sapna.
Sir, the office is going to
shout for the Puja from tomorrow.
So I was completing my work.
It is very good to see
someone working so hard.
One day, when I get the
time I will take you out.
For coffee.
I would love that, sir.
Bye.
Good evening sir.
I am coming, darling.
Good evening, sir. - Good evening.
This is the visitor's entry book
Get the employer's book. - Sorry, sir.
Thank you.
Come.
It's not opening.
Thank you. - Rana please hurry.
Thanks.
Mrs. Bagchi, quickly do
whatever you want to do.
Bob.. Come on Bob,
pick up the phone.
Bob Bob.
Mrs. Bagchi, hurry up please.
Rana, just a minute.
I am almost there.
Mrs. Bagchi, what is happening?
Sapna was right, there are
many layers of protection.
It will take a little time.
Mrs. Bagchi, why is it taking
you so long to check an IP address?
Rana. Rana. IP address.
It's the same IP address.
Mr. Briefcase. We've nailed him.
- Are you sure?
Of course.
Guard! Guard!
Why are you sleeping? Get up.
Yes. - Was someone here
with Sapna madam?
A man and a woman.
Oh no. Close all doors.
Don't let anyone go out.
Yes, sir.
Did anyone come down?
No, sir.
Where did they go? Where can they..
Hey
The back entrance, where
people go to smoke is it open?
Yes, sir.
Come.
We came out at the right time.
Oh no.
Mrs. Bagchi, come quickly.
Hello.
Sir we came out from the back entrance..
Shridhar is following us.
What happened? Who are you calling?
Yes.
Please come quickly, sir.
We need help.
What happened?
I had to call Khan sir.
Khan?
Sorry. Shridhar is right behind us.
Maybe he knows.
Come.
What did you take from my computer?
Gun.
Where is my gun?
Come. Let's go, Mrs. Bagchi.
Rana, bag.
Stop it. - Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
We want this man alive.
No, no, no. this man can't die.
Oh no. We wanted this man alive.
Why didn't you call me earlier?
How will we catch Milan now?
How will we catch Milan without him?
Take him to the hospital.
Rana works for me.
Mrs. Bagchi, do you
remember what I said.
We've been looking for
Milan for the past two years.
And we had this last
option to find him.
You. You could do what we couldn't.
But you ruined the entire plan.
Actually, Mrs. Bagchi, there's
someone in the organization..
...who is helping Milan.
Mr. Khan couldn't
reopen the case himself.
So he asked for my help.
...so that we can
find Milan through you.
'Do you love your job?""
'Yes, sir.'
'From today you will work for me.'
Why me?
Because no one's
scared of a pregnant woman.
Especially one whose
husband has run away.
No one would've doubted.
But, Mrs. Bagchi,
only because of you..
...we could find out that Milan is
responsible for Vijay's death too.
And we could reach Shridhar
only because of you, Mrs. Bagchi.
You were using me.
Yes.
Your case was revived
only because of me..
...because Arnab looks just like Milan.
But we don't have time for..
And Agnes?
Dr. Ganguly? - Collateral damage.
One needs to make small
sacrifices in big battles..
...what's the big deal?
And me? My child?
Nothing would've happened to you.
I wouldn't have allowed it.
I took up this
assignment only because of you.
Mrs. Bagchi, we wanted Shridhar alive.
He was the only one
who could've lead us..
...to the man who is helping
Milan from within the system.
Listen to me carefully.
We have one last option.
You have hacked Shridhar's computer.
Do it again. We might find a clue.
Why should I help you?
I am not asking for
your help, Mrs. Bagchi.
I am telling you.
Mrs. Bagchi. Mrs. Bagchi.
Bishnu!
Mr. Khan.
This is the only code
that I don't understand.
Rest of the computer is clean.
CXWWEDFXZS.
Is that all you found?
Rana. Any idea?
No. |I don't know.
What can it be?
Give me your phone, sir.
CXWWEDFXZS.
Sir, I feel this is a mobile number.
This is Bhaskaran's number.
What the..
Mrs. Bagchi. You will have
to do one last thing for me.
Mrs. Bagchi.
Are you listening?
Mrs. Bagchi.
Call Bhaskaran.
And lie to him that..
...you found some data about
him on Shridhar's computer?
Why should I do that?
Because Bhaskaran
is our last chance..
...to find Arnab and Milan.
Mrs. Bagchi.
I have always been rude with you..
This time it's a request, so..
Please help me.
Mr. Bhaskaran.
Yes.
Who is this?
This is Vidya Bagchi speaking.
Where did you get my number from?
From Shriddhar's computer.
I have found some more papers
in your name. - So?
Look, I don't care about
who you are or what you do.
I will return all your papers..
...in return I want the government
to help me find my husband.
Look, I don't know
why you are calling me.
I will inform my local office.
They will contact you.
Now?
If you want to see
your husband alive..
...then wait for my call.
Milan Damji.
Yes, I need a big brown envelope.
Okay.
Hello.
How are you?
Fine.
I had to make a promise.
But before that..
...this is for you.
Today's the last day of the Puja.
I cannot take this.
No, no, no, Mrs. Bagchi, this..
I still have the receipt.
I wanted to promise you that..
...I will help you in finding Arnab.
And when we find him, I will
make him pay for this sari.
This is from Arnab, not me.
I am sorry, Mrs. Bagchi.
I am really very sorry.
Thank you.
Sorry.
Paresh Pal.
Yes, Paresh.
You were asking about
Milan Damji, weren't you?
Yes, did you find out anything?
The news is that he
has returned to Kolkata.
Wow. Then Khan
sir's plan is working.
Only Milan can come see Vidya.
Bhaskaran doesn't have
any other option. - Vidya?
Yes.
As soon as Milan comes to
see her, he will be caught.
You want to sacrifice a helpless girl?
No, no, no, this isn't my plan.
This is Khan sir's plan.
And Mrs. Bagchi..
Move. - Call him up.
Sir, sir. Sir, I am sorry.
Just a minute.
We will have to stop this operation
at any cost, sir. - Yes.
If Milan meets Mrs. Bagchi,
then her life is in danger.
So? - You don't understand, sir.
Milan never leaves
behind any eye-witness.
He will do the same
this time as well.
So, we will try to
save your Mrs. Bagchi.
You know, sir.
You know, yet you are..
Sacrificing her.
This is wrong.
You are intentionally. - Shut up.
You want to teach
me right and wrong.
My job is to protect the country..
...and anything I do for that is right.
If I have to sacrifice Vidya
Bagchi to catch Milan Damji..
...then that's right too.
Then what is the difference
between us and Milan, sir?
There's no difference.
We do it for the law and
he does it against the law.
That's why we are
right and he's wrong.
Love is a good thing, Rana.
But learn to use it
at the right place.
Meaning?
Your love that's telling you Go
tell Vidya Bagchi about Khan.
That's wrong.
This way you can save only one life..
...but what about thousands of
lives that Milan will take?
I wasn't going to tell her, sir, but..
Rajveer, take his mobile.
Don't let him go anywhere.
Not even to the bathroom.
No, sir. Nothing important.
Yes, so what were you saying?
Bidya didi.
Bidya didi.
Didi.
You are Sharma, aren't you?
- Yes, why?
Khan sir is calling you.
- Where?
In the AC.. OC chamber.
You go.
And he has asked me to sit here.
I will keep a watch on him.
Rana. Go.
Go, go.
What about you?
- I will handle it here. Go.
Thank you, Chatterjee.
Rana. - Yes.
Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.
Hello.
Triangular Park.
Hello.
Triangular Park. Triangular Park.
Get lost.
Sir, where is Rana?
To hell with him. Come on.
Rajveer, follow us.
Come on, hurry up.
Come on, come on, hurry up.
Where is Mrs. Bagchi?
She paid her dues and left.
Where did she go?
- Didi went to Triangular Park.
Mrs. Bagchi.
Take a left from here, Mrs. Bagchi.
Mrs. Bagchi.
Where are the files?
Who are you?
What difference does it make?
Files.
Milan Damji..
...who was just a story until now.
I have very little time, Mrs. Bagchi.
If you want your husband back Files.
If I return the papers then..
...will you return me my husband?
Yes. Files.
Can you return him?
Think about it.
Who are you?
What difference does it make?
Mrs. Bagchi. Mrs. Bagchi.
Catch her.
Check him. Check him.
Catch her. She's
wearing a white sari.
I said she's wearing a white sari.
Are you blind?
Who was Mrs. Bagchi?
Vidya Bagchi was a story, sir?
Meaning?
Where is Mrs. Bagchi?
- 'Didi went to Triangular Park.'
'Triangular Park.'
'This is a flying swan.'
<i>""Where did you find this uniform?""</i>
'This? It's my school uniform.'
""Back when I lived in Thakurpukur.'
'Any uncle. Anyone.'
'He has an uncle, who
lives in Thakurpukur.'
""Did you ever tell
Didi Vidya about this?""
'Yes, when we met for the first time.'
'I have heard many stories about it.'
Check her hotel room
and her finger prints.
It's of no use, sir.
'Why are you cleaning it yourself?'
What? - 'Just one sign
and then you can leave.'
'Sign here.'
'Here.'
And her husband, Arnab?
Oh, so you haven't
understood yet, sir.
What? - 'In the beginning,
you told her a story.'
'There is no one called Milan.'
Yes, so?
And she told us a story.
'My husband is missing.'
'Arnab Bagchi didn't stay here.'
'No, dear.'
'He didn't leave
London or land in Kolkata.'
Milan was for real, sir.
But there is no
Vidya Bagchi nor Arnab..
...who looks like Milan. - 'Arnab didn't
like to get his picture taken.'
'Until Agnes didn't see
Arnab's photo properly.'
'And the day we find Milan,
we will find Arnab.'
What the..
That means until now.. - Correct.
She kept using us.
Sir, it seems like
Vidya Bagchi was hired..
...to find and kill Milan Damji.
And she used us to find Milan.
She wanted us to use
her as a scapegoat..
...to find Milan Damji.
And before we could arrest Shridhar.
Vidya killed him as well.
Sir, you gave Bhaskaran
and Milan to her yourself.
She knew.
'No one doubts a pregnant woman.'
'What did you take from my computer?'
Who is Satyoki?
'Arjun's charioteer.'
That's me, sir.
My name is Satyoki.
But who sent her?
And why did she help us?
'Arup.'
'Sorry, we couldn't
save your child.'
'Arup took up this assignment
only because I forced him to.'
'It's completely my fault.'
Arup must be really
happy today, Vidya.
He must be proud of you.
Because today you have accomplished..
...what we all couldn't.
You want to know a
strange thing, Colonel.
In the last few days..
...I completely forgot
that I am not pregnant.
It felt like..
...my child is still alive inside me.
It felt like..
I might find Arup as well.
I cannot live without them, Colonel.
I want my Arup back.
I want my child back.
'Today, two years later.'
'The family of those
killed in the Metro attack..'
""..have finally got an answer.'
'Sometimes even
God's make mistakes.'
'Gods created demons.'
""Bestowed them with power.'
""But when they started
abusing that power..
...Gods created Mother Durga.'
'To destroy the demons.'
'It's said that Goddess Durga..
...was created by gathering
the strength of all the mothers'
'Every year the Mother

Every morning Pari (Hetal Gada) and Chotu's (Krrish Chhabria) long walk to school begins with a coin toss outside their hut. The winner will decide if the story that will be told on the way to school that day will be one about a Shah Rukh Khan film or a Salman Khan film. The siblings are rivals in their love for the two stars. Pari is devoted to Shah Rukh and Chotu worships Salman Khan (down to wearing a replica of the star's trademark silver bracelet with a blue stone).

Ten-year-old Pari holds her precocious eight-year-old brother's hand throughout the journey to school and back. She's not just his friend and sister but, since Chotu is visually impaired, also his guide. With just months to go before Chotu turns nine, Pari feels the pressure to fulfill her promise to her brother - that he will have his eyesight back before his ninth birthday.

She finds some hope when she spots a poster of Shah Rukh Khan (SRK) encouraging eye donations. She begins to write him letters addressed to his home, Mannat, in Mumbai, which go unanswered. Eventually, they realize that he is not in Mumbai but in a village in Rajasthan for a film shoot portraying a Rajput prince. Convinced that a meeting with SRK is all it would take to get Chotu his eyes back, the children set off alone on a 300 km journey traversing testing terrain.",1335,NA,NA,NA

"82","tt1395025","Agent Vinod",2012,"Plot

Somewhere in a Taliban camp in the Dasht-e-Madar desert, in Afghanistan, ISI official Col. Huzefa is interrogating a captured man presumed to be a RAW agent. The man gives details of RAW's operations in Afghanistan in exchange for money and safe passage across the border. In doing so, he betrays his colleague, Major Rajan, who has also infiltrated the camp. This is, however, revealed to be a ruse, as both overpower their captors and fight their way out of the camp. Along the way, they rescue a girl called Farah, who was being held hostage.

Later, the captured man who escaped with Rajan is revealed, in New Delhi, to be Agent Vinod, who is shown a video message recorded by Rajan from Russia mentioning '242' just moments before being shot dead and tasked by RAW chief Hassan Nawaz to find out what '242' is. Vinod travels to St. Petersburg to intercept criminal don Abu Nazer and is almost captured, but manages to escape killing Abu in the process and goes to Tangier, Morocco. He assumes the identity of Freddie Khambatta and meets the Russian mafia boss David Kazaan and his personal Pakistani doctor, Ruby Mendes. Vinod manages to convince Kazaan that he is indeed Freddie and hacks his phone. He gets closer to Ruby to find out what '242' is and finds out that her name is actually Iram Parveen Bilal, and she is a British-Pakistani working undercover for the ISI. He obtains an invitation card for a private auction and learns that many international businessmen, some of them terrorist groups, are converging at an antiques auction in Marrakesh to purchase '242'.

At the auction, Vinod learns that '242' is actually the detonator for a nuclear device, and runs into businessman and philanthropist Jagdishwar Metla, with whom he has a disturbing conversation. A bidding war ensues, and Kazaan manages to secure the detonator through his Russian girlfriend. Eventually, when ISI chief Col. Iftekhar Ahmed is later shot dead in Pakistan by Col. Huzefa moments after being informed of a few defectors, it turns out that a group of rogue ISI colonels, including Huzefa, is planning a nuclear attack on India. Back in Morocco, Kazaan locks the detonator with a password, and hands it over to the mysterious 'Colonel', who has arrived in Morocco. Iram finds out that Vinod is a RAW agent and both agree to work together to prevent the nuclear device from falling into the wrong hands. 'Colonel' captures Ruby and asks her to reveal the whereabouts of Vinod; he then blackmails Vinod's contact into deceitfully retrieving the detonator and later has him killed before Vinod, who realizes the betrayal, can question him at gunpoint. Shortly afterwards, he is attacked and admitted to a hospital. He clears his way out of the hospital to find Iram. 'Colonel', now having the detonator, reaches Riga, Latvia to acquire the bomb. He is joined by rogue mercenary Jimmy, who is to detonate the bomb.

'Colonel' enlists Iram to help his men transport the bomb out of Latvia and tries to kill her, but fails. Vinod and Iram join hands again and try to capture the 'Colonel' and the bomb and reach Karachi, where they bump into Farah as she gets them access inside a function attended by Col. Pasha, only for Vinod and Iram to be captured by Col. Huzefa and nevertheless manage to escape. Meanwhile, elsewhere, the house of an old man known only as 'Professor', who has links to 'Colonel', is infiltrated by the RAW team with Iram visiting in the name of 'Colonel'; despite 'Colonel' leaking her allegiances to him, when 'Professor' tries to kill Iram, he is neutralized by a team of special forces soldiers. Later, while putting two and two together through artifacts recovered from 'Professor' at his house, they learn of a plot to smuggle the nuclear device from Karachi into India, via the sea route, and learn that the target of the bomb is New Delhi. They make it to Delhi, where Jimmy has already reached, and try to locate the bomb, but fail when Jimmy sets off a grenade and Vinod loses him in the fracas. Iram runs into 'Colonel', disguised as a pilot, again when she bumps into Metla and is fatally shot, but points him out to Indian security forces, who spring into action when he holds Metla at gunpoint; Metla manages to free himself from 'Colonel', and in a shootout, his head is chopped to pieces by the helicopter blades. Eventually, Vinod successfully tracks down the bomb to a restaurant, strategically killing Jimmy, and takes it up in an NSG helicopter to detonate it as far away from the city as possible since nobody knows the password; he asks Hassan to connect him to Iram, who is being treated for her gunshot wounds. Iram realises the password to the detonator was set by Kazaan and asks Vinod to try the name of Kazaan's camel - ""Zilleh"". The bomb is successfully defused, though Iram succumbs to her gunshot wounds.

Vinod meets up with Hassan, who informs him of a flashdrive recovered from 'Colonel'; he later visits Metla, revealing to him that he knows Metla has had a hand in the conspiracy as its mastermind since he had struck a deal with 'Colonel' to earn the Zeus Group millions of dollars and orchestrated the nuclear attack for his own benefit; Metla, however, mocks him, claiming geopolitical affairs like these are too complex for ""lowkey"" officers like him to understand. Unbeknownst to Metla, Vinod is secretly recording the conversation through a wire, with the Lashkar-e-Taiba's London cell listening in since minutes before their meeting. Realizing that they have been manipulated into almost starting a war with India, with the Pakistani government cracking down on them, the cell sends a suicide bomber to assassinate Metla at a function in his honour, even as Vinod proclaims to Metla that he must die ""like a hero"". Metla is killed, but posthumously feted as a great philanthropist. Later, on a beach in Cape Town, the Russian woman who first acquired the nuclear device is seen sunbathing; she looks up to find Vinod smiling at her, indicating he has moved on to his next mission.",6037,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt1395025.srt","SALAM.

Not... Not..
Arms dealer found dead in a graveyard outside Moscow.
Early this morning.
The murder of Russian arms dealer Andre Sukhorov..
.. has again thrown up this dangerous question.
Did Sukhorov possess a suitcase nuclear bomb?
And if so, where is it?
Both the United States and Soviet Union..
.. have acknowledged producing nuclear weapons..
.. small enough to be carried in specially designed backpacks..
.. during the cold-war.
These bombs, identified in Russia as KV series..
.. have the explosive power between..
.. Three and Ten kiloton of TNT.
The bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki..
.. were 20-30 kiloton each.
But the value of the suitcase bomb lies..
.. in its ability to be easily smuggled across borders..
.. transported by means widely available.
And placed as close to the target as possible.
A single suitcase bomb can devastate..
.. three kilometers of a modern city.
It will kill everything within a ten kilometer radius..
.. and the radiation will subsequently kill more.
Gentlemen Sukhorov is dead
I've heard the bomb is up for sale
This is what every terror group in the world is looking for.
This could start World War 3.
If this gets into the wrong hands, millions will be killed.
I was thinking billions.
Comrades!
It's my friend Dmitri's birthday.
So we all have a drink, okay.
Make drink.

Bravo, Mr. Kazan.
Can I get a towel, please?

Why don't you stay the night?
What is on your mind, Mr. Kazan?

Here.
I don't think you exploded that bomb..
Why do you say that?
You have killer eyes..
But they're not the eyes of a killer.
Tell that to my London court judge.
You know everything about me.
Tell me something about yourself.
I cannot lie.
And you'll catch me if I tell the truth.
I am in the same business as you.
But why are we talking shop

If you see my mother again..

Whoever he is, get rid of him.
Hello, my dear.
The pipeline goes through this lane..
.. and we have an observation post every 10 kilometers.
Sir, there's a call for you.
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Nawaz.
Hello, Mr. lftekhaar.
I can hear raging fire and roaring rain.
You are in Chaman.
Impressive, Mr. Nawaz.
Even at this age, you still have keen ears.
I can even hear what's happening in Morocco.
I just heard that David Kazan has bought a nuclear bomb.
What? Where did you get this news from?
Mr. Nawaz, you will have to share your source with me.
Because if there's any truth in this..
.. then we'll need to cooperate.
Tell me, General.
Are you involved?
I have no idea.
I didn't know at all.
If I had any clue about this..
.. then I would have called you myself.
Look, Mr. lftekhaar, whatever the problems between us..
.. this cannot be the solution.
Thank you very much.
Give me 12 hours. I will call you back.
Goodbye.
Cancel the inspection.
We will return to Islamabad right now.
Cancel my trip to China.
And call an emergency meeting..
.. of all the section chiefs tomorrow.
Specially section Q, okay.
Fine.
Take lftekhaar sir's convoy to the Turkhum border..
.. and blow it up with a launcher.
I'll keep you posted, sir.
Breaking news.
ISI chief lftekhaar Ahmed killed in a bomb blast.
Is this Zaheer's home?
This is Zaheer's home, but he is on the terrace.
Thank You! - You're welcome
Who are you? - I am Freddie.
Freddie Khambatta. - What?
Yes. I am Freddie.
If you are Freddie then who is he?
So you were telling the truth that day.
You are a RAW agent!
Who is the Colonel?
Where is the bomb? - That's what I came here to find out.
I thought you knew about him.
She's trying to confuse us.
Where is the bomb?
I am on your side.
I work for the British Intelligence.
And you killed that British agent?
I didn't kill Richard.
He was my handler.
I went there to inform him about you.
To show him your face.
You killed 40 people in London.
You were smiling as you got out of the car.
You were smiling.
I was smiling, because I was happy.
It was a beautiful day.
Boss, why are you listening to this nonsense?
I am responsible for the death of those 40 people.
Because my own friends..
.. had planted the bomb in my car.
I was waiting for them.
If I wasn't feeling hungry..
.. and hadn't stepped out..
.. then the blast would have killed me..
When one of the group was caught in Pakistan..
.. then ISI chief lftekhaar Ahmed came to see me.
He was convinced that I am innocent.
He convinced Richard.
They said that they will help me..
.. but I will have to work for them.
They sprung me out of jail..
.. and sent me to Morocco, to Kazan.
Kazan buys drugs from terrorists, and supplies arms.
So you are an ISI agent?
I just report to lftekhaar Sir.
He knows the truth about me.
Last month I intercepted Abu Nazir's phone call from Moscow..
.. that Freddie Khambatta is arriving with $50 million.
I informed Richard, that's why he came here personally.
Can you prove this?
Talk to lftekhaar sir.
He knows me.
lftekhaar Ahmed is dead.
He's dead?
And Richard too.
Now there's no one left to prove your story. And you..
Zahir.
He's one of them.
Now he knows about you.
Shoot him.
No.
I cannot kill anyone.
Not even him.
I don't know where the bomb is.
But the Rubaiyat is the trigger.
The bomb is useless without Rubaiyat.
And right now Rubaiyat is in Kazan's safe.
If you believe me then let me go.
I know the combination of that safe.
Otherwise go yourself.
But for God's sake get that Rubaiyat out of there.
Let's go.
Come on.
20 minutes.
Good luck, Iram.
She was lying.
You believed her?
She was telling the truth.
I have the Rubaiyat and the location of the bomb as well.
Meet me at Golden Farah restaurant, in 20 minutes.
Get lost.
""My friends deserted me.""
""My love deserted me.""
""Life's so..""
Indian?
Oh, good. Number one.
Goodbye to Morocco.

By the way, I work for the United Nations.
Deputy Health Commissioner for Africa.
Is this a joke?
I am the Deputy Health Commissioner for Africa.
We need to ask you some questions, Mr. Shastri.
How are you feeling?
I am hungry.
We found Mr. Kazan's address in your pocket.
He's dead. His house has been burgled.
How do you know him? - I mean him in an auction.
Don't disturb the patient please.
I need to examine the patient Officers.
I will see you in some time.
Good morning. - Good morning, Doctor.
Three bullets and you're still alive.
You must be really lucky.
Do you believe in luck?
If I believed in luck I'd be dead a long time ago, Doctor.
I see.
Do you believe in luck, doctor?
Where is she?
Where is she?
Where is she? - Riga.
Riga.
Do you know where they are?
Look at that man closely.
Anton Brega.
Considers himself a Casanova.
He is an alcoholic.. and a womanizer
He has one more bad habit.
He's honest.
He's the Airport Security chief.
There's a pass card in his wallet which I want.
We'll be done by 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
Until then you will have to keep him out of the airport.
So.. you have to spend the night with him.
Get lost! I am not your property!
Bloody reptile!
I just want to die.
No, actually, I just want to get drunk.
Sorry. - No, that's okay. That's fine.
Give me another one.
What do you want? Just get lost.
Okay. Sir, please.
Thank you.
Anton Brega. - Josie.
I told you to get lost.
We just got out of the third casino.
He has won around three-four lakhs.
He says I am lucky for him.
Now he wants to take me home.
Two more hours.
Our job will be done.
Take him to Hotel Riga. 405.
There's a room booked in the name of Josie.
Yeah, 405. - Darling, I've got some special champagne for you.
That's for you. Look at it.
Goodbye.
Hello, sir.
Welcome to Riga. Mr. Nawaz called from Delhi.
This packet is for you.
Any news about those two?
""My darling, I said.""
""My darling, you heard it.""
""Our hearts communicated with each other.""
""My darling, I said.""
""My darling, you heard it.""
""My darling, I said.""
Hello.
Excuse me.
Yes.
That Brega is after me.
He's about to jump on me.
Relax.
Open the mini bar.
There's a chocolate box inside.
Feed him some of those chocolates.
He'll pass out for a few hours.
What about the package? - You want to see it?
Knock him out and leave right away.
Okay, fine.
I was waiting for you at Golden Farah.
Thank God you are alive.
Enough of your charade. - Listen to me.
Colonel had asked me to - Where is the Colonel?
I was just talking to him.
The bomb is here.. in the city.
The man in the room with me is..
You saved my life.
Time for a little chat, Colonel.
You okay? - Get me out of here.
Get here, now.
Get down.
Ready?
Catch them.
He's heading straight.
He's taking a turn.
He's near town square.
Straight and left.
20 kilometers from here.
He has stopped near Maxima Mall.
Don't you want to know why I lied to you in Morocco
Maybe you didn't like my shoes?
'The Colonel had killed Kazan.'
'He was about to kill me.. '
'And suddenly I saw.. '
'In another minute..'
'..Freddie Khambatta would've told him everything'
'The man you think is Freddie Khambatta is actually a RAW agent.'
'I thought that if I told the Colonel about you..
..I might gain his trust.' - 'Where is he? '
'Maybe he would involve me in whatever his plan was..
I did it to find out about the bomb.
'Sir, I am.. '
'Just a minute. Just a minute.'
'Sir, I am Freddie Khambatta.'
'I am a flight purser.'
'Abu gave me a $10 note. What was his name? '
'I don't know his name. He beat me.'
'He took the dollar I was supposed to give you.'
Colonel had taken my phone away.
I snatched someone's phone from the airport toilet
.. and tried calling you.
How will you face three armed men with one bullet?
Don't be afraid.
May God give your husband a long life.
It's stopped.
Come here.
Where did you get this? - What is that?
Where did you get this? - I don't know. What is that?
Where did you get this? - I don't know.
This tracker. - I am telling you, I don't know.
Dr. Suresh Krishna.
Dr. Suresh Krishna?
We are waiting for you
Sorry, sir. This is portable X-ray machine no. 311.
Maybe the colonel lied to you.
Brega's pass was used not to bring bomb into the city
.. but to take it out of the city.
13 flights have taken off..
..since Brega's death..
.. they can be checked only on landing.
The local police want to question you.
Cops in Moscow and Morocco police want to question me as well.
You are in a queue.
Keys please.
I'll be in touch, sir.
Who are you? - Mr. Khana.
Where are they?
They say you need too eat to gain something.
Whenever you get the opportunity, recharge.
Sit down, eat something.
What's on your mind?
Wondering what happens next?
Don't worry, we'll help you.
You cannot help me.
New identity, passport, character certificate.
Money.
What do you want?
What do I want?
I want my life back.
I want my father, who died when I was in jail.
I want the clinic, with a board outside saying..
.. Doctor Iram Parveen Bilal.
I want a home.
A husband who's crazy about me.
I want kids.
I want a normal life.
I want a world..
..where the Rubaiyat is just a book with beautiful poetry.
Not a nuclear bomb detonator.
There's a circuit inside that activates the bomb.
I have some more information.
Take that as well.
I overheard the Colonel on the phone last night.
He was fixing a meeting with Taimoor Pasha on the 28th.
At Hotel Gazebo.
Hotel Gazebo is in Karachi.
I don't know anything else.
And I don't want to either.
Can I go now?
Where will you go?
Anywhere.
I wanted to be a painter.
I thought I will be famous.
A house in the mountains.
Exhibitions in Paris.
Five marriages.
Couple of kids from each marriage..
But the cable snapped. - What?
One of the cables of the ropeway snapped.
We were in Mussoorie, on a school trip.
The entire cabin was dangling on one cable.
A sheer 2000 feet deep drop below.
The other cable could snap any moment..
Plunging us to our death. And then I climbed up.
I clung to a rope for eight minutes.
And managed to secure the cable.
I was 15 years old.
I got a medal from President Venkatraman.
Those eight minutes changed my life.
I always wanted to return..
.. to that place between life and death.
I am still hanging from that cable.
The day I let go..
In Delhi, when the dogs from one lane start barking..
.. do you know what the other dogs do?
Good evening, sir.
Sir, we've to leave for the airport in an hour.
You're leaving for London.
They are waiting for you at the Embassy.
I've got all the documents with me.
Passports. Documents and some money, sir.
Excuse me.
Can I clear the table?
Five minutes, Iram.
I've a flight to catch. Kill them.
Sir, I will wait in the lobby. - Okay.
Rajesh.
Sir.
Where is it?
Sir.
Where is it?
I had no option.
How many people outside?

What kind of security is this?
Who is this girl?
Interpol, Indian government, who is behind her?
We will find out. - Find out.
Who are you?
Who do you work for?
I work for Pakistan.
Who do you work for?
What is this?
The longer you take..
.. the more fun it will be for me
Don't worry about me.
I am in my own country.
You leave. Good bye.
There's another spy here.
Find him.
This is him.
Listen.. excuse me..
I am sorry.
We've found the spy.
Listen to me.
Your partner's been caught.
You are a traitor.
That's why Gen. lftekhaar never trusted you.
I am sure you are responsible for his death.
How do you know General lftekhaar?
Leave me. I haven't done anything.
What.. what is happening here?
I haven't done anything.
I swear.
I was only eating betel leaf.
Chewing betel leaf is allowed.
Is he your partner?
I don't know him.
I don't know her personally.
I saw her performing at the dance
She was singing.
I swear.. I swear I haven't done anything.
I came with the wedding procession from Rawalpindi.
And my father..
Father own a reputed hotel.
Your days of spying are over.. my friend.
Every dog has his day.
What is Blue Bird?
How dare you ask me questions?
Have you captured me?
There's going to be a big blast in Delhi tomorrow.
Unfortunately you won't be there to see it.
Won't you fulfill my last wish, Colonel?
You want a chopper to get out of here?
I want a chilled beer.
I am sure you can arrange for it.
Get him a beer.
But don't give him the bottle.
Bring it in a paper cup.
He's very cunning.
Anything else.
Juice for you?
Thank you.
Will you marry me?
Where to now?
Delhi.
We're in Karachi?
We need to reach Jahangir point in ten minutes.
Welcome.
The pilot says we'll leave at dawn.
You'll be in Delhi in two hours.
All the arrangements have been done.
You will have to fly really low..
.. for the Geiger counter to detect any radiation.
But what is wrong? Tell me.
Sorry, sir. I cannot tell you anything.
Mr. Nawaz is going to brief you.
You cannot make baseless allegations against Pakistan.
Do you have evidence?
Colonel Huzefa mentioned 'Blue Bird'.
What is 'Blue Bird'? - Colonel Huzefa died in Karachi yesterday.
So how can you say that he's involved?
I saw him giving orders myself.
Tehmur Pasha was present there as well.
They spoke about the bomb
You're betraying your country, and accusing others.
The meeting is over. - No, it's not over.
If this bomb explodes in Delhi, there'll be nuclear war.
We will launch a counter attack. In 20 minutes,
Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad will be annihilated.
More than 60 lakh people will die on both sides.
If you say Pakistan isn't involved..
.. then this is the time to prove it.
What is Blue Bird?
Name? Place? What is it?
Believe me, I don't know.
Mr. Khan, I can be court-martialed for bringing you here.
But millions can be saved as well.
Control room. 10 geo-stationary satellites.
And two roaming.
There are more than 4000 cameras installed in Delhi.
We can see everything.
And maybe you can see your wife in one of these cameras..
.. who just returned home after dropping your kids to school.
There are other mothers, children, families who have no idea..
.. that everything will be over in four hours.
I believe it, Mr. Khan. That you don't know.
But there must be someone in Pakistan..
..in ISI or in your embassy..
..who knows! Please, find out.
""These days he never stops anyone.""
""No matter what you do, it never interferes.""
""There's loot and plunder all around, and destruction.""
""God is up above, and we're on earth.""
Would you like to have tea?
""These days He pays less attention to us.""
One world government.
Look I've never understood this term.
We are a small circle of friends.
Including top bankers, oil magnets, media personalities..
.. political figures, even an ex-president of the United States.
Yes. And this group has control over almost the entire world economy.
Maybe what you are saying is right.
But these immense resources.
If they are used properly, then anything is possible.
Governments have their own agenda.
Their own programs.
But at the end of the day..
.. it is the individual that matters.
Blue Bird is the Lashkar's safe house..
.. and Professor Yusuf Malik's house.
Ashiana Bungalow. Khilji road. Behind Qutub complex.
We cannot raid that place, sir.
What if they press the trigger? - We don't have an option.
There's one way.
Professor Malik. - Yes.
I am Iram.
Iram Parveen Bilal.
I want to meet the Colonel.
Who?
You've got the wrong address.
Please.
Iram.
Last year, London bombings.
Is the Colonel here or not?
Come in.
The Colonel didn't mention anything about you.
Where is he?
He's gone to the bus stop.
Will be back soon.
How far? - He'll be back.
Will you have tea?
Yes, thank you.
What is that?
Locate HOHO bus 6DL 3323.
Next stop is Red Fort.
Stay at Red Fort, one hour. - Built in 1638.
Come, ma'am, take care of your belongings.
I am heading towards the bus.
Are you ok?
Why are you standing? Sit down.
I am fine, thank you.
I will get biscuits.
She's working for the cops, Professor.
Kill her.
And don't disconnect the phone.
Let it be, I'll do it.
""I just spoke to the Colonel, you traitor""
Move in. Move in.
Are you okay?
He just called the Colonel. - Ok.
Triangulate this number. 9810160605.
Triangulating 9810160605.
Sir, this number has been switched off.
Near Pari Chowk, Noida. I am sending a chopper.
Jimmy, get out of the bus.
And find your own way to the target.
No, don't touch the timer until I say so.
""Since Bisleri got popular.""
""Everyone forgot about wells and handpumps.""
""Since Bisleri got popular.""
""Everyone forgot about wells and handpumps.""
""Even though farmers produced food-grains.""
""They had to commit suicide.""
Where to, sir? - Janpath.
That will be Rs. 200.
Let's go.
What's in the bag? - Nothing.
Can I see?
The call's been triangulated in Noida.
Cell tower 26 D. come on, move.
How far is Noida? - Five minutes.
Move. Move. Move.
Move.
Move.
Hello, sir.
Yes, I've left the bus.
Take us to Kinari Bazaar.
Kinari Bazaar.
I'm heading straight. Please get down.
We've sat down now. Let's go.
It's a smart dress.
But it makes me look fat.
- I love sarees. - I look very smart.
I think this guy is taking us for a ride.
Where are you going?
Turn around. Take a U-turn.
Can't you hear?
Are you deaf?
Get down at the signal. - Why should we get down?
Get down at the signal. - I'll make the inspector teach you a lesson.
Look, sir. He's really.. - Get down.
What's wrong? Why are you screaming?
What is wrong?
He has the bomb.
Don't give him a chance to press the trigger.
Shoot only if you get a headshot.
Only if you get a headshot.
Not receiving Cam 56 from Barakhambha.
Cam 3 zoom in. Stay.
He's taken the ITO flyover.
He's entered the one way from the opposite side.
Why aren't you listening?
Oh, God!
We are checking the area around the cell tower, sir.
The mobile phone is switched off.
Frankly he can be anywhere.
Sir Metla is here for a charity program.
That is why there is a lot of crowd, sir.
Yes, certainly.
Dr. Ruby. - Sir Metla.
What are you doing here?
You are here for a charity function.
I don't do charity. I do investments.
We're getting late.
Good, sir. Good.
Move it. Clear the traffic. Move them.
Sir, driver body.
Bomb! Bomb!
I lost him.
Iram, come in.
Iram, come in. Iram, come in.
Thank you for your hospitality.
Is there a scheduled time for the helicopter to leave?
We should go now. It's really getting late now.
There was a technical problem, sir.
It's been solved. But we should leave immediately.
Okay, let's go.
I will think about it.
The pilot is the Colonel.
Get in. Get in.
Stop.
My glasses.
I need my glasses.
Please, my glasses.
Rascal.
Colonel, I am in an ice-cream parlor at Connaught Place.
Nirula's.
Only nine minutes left.
I will call you again.
Happy birthday to you.
Everybody out.
Get out, come on.
Go.
Everybody out.
Everybody out.
Go, go, go.
Darn it.
Sir. I have found the bomb.
It's demanding a password.
Run, run. Vacate the place.
Everybody out.
Hurry up.
Come on, come on, come on everybody.
The firing circuit has completely failed.
I will have to open it completely.
Open it. - That will take time.
At least 15-20 minutes.
Ground all choppers, sir. Only four minutes left.
Waiting for coordinates.
Get me the map for outer Delhi.
Fly north by north east, Radial 045.
Fly high for the first two minutes.
Then at 500 feet for the last minute.
Setting course, north by north east.
Radial 045.
The old copper mine is seven kilometers away..
..from Delhi-Jaipur Highway.
You'll see an old copper mine.
The mine is 2000 feet deep
Crash the bomb in the mine. - Roger that, sir.
It was a privilege serving with you, my boy.
Jai Hind, sir.
Requesting personal time.
Connect me to Iram, sir.
Iram. Iram.
I know that. Iram, it's Vinod.
Iram. - Is everything okay?
Under control.
Are you fine? - I am not going to make it, Vinod.
What happened?
That bastard shot me. - Where are you hit?
How bad is it? - Two bullets on the liver.
I've lost lot of blood.
Can you come here? Please.
What happened? Can you come here?
I am in the helicopter, with the bomb.
Trying to take it as far away from the city as possible.
Why.. Why can't we diffuse the bomb?
It's asking for the password, which I don't have.
Listen to me, Iram.
I had decided..
.. that I would try and give you the life you wanted.
I just want you to know that I had decided that.
If there is something on the other side..
Then we'll meet soon.
Just one minute left.
Say something terrific.
Stay with me.
Iram.
Press it. Press it.
Password.
Kazan set it in Morocco.
Kazan?
Do you know the password?
Do you know his mother's name?
He killed her himself. - What?
Who? - Zilleh.
Zilleh? - Zilleh. Zilleh.
Who's Zilleh?
Who Iram?
His pet camel
Zilleh.
Spell it.
Can you spell it?
Z I L L..
Iram. - E H.
We did it.
We made it, baby.
You wanted a world..
.. where this Rubaiyat is just a book of poems.
Maybe you are in such a world now.
We found this on the Colonel's body.
Possibly his insurance policy.
Check it.
We cannot touch this man.
He's beyond our reach.
And its impossible to prove anything in court.
If anything happens to him.
An accident or..
Cheers.
In the last 48 hours Pakistan's army has raided..
..training camps and many sleeper cells of Lashkar.
And more than 200 operatives have been killed..
..and around 600 have been arrested.
These raids have served..
..a harsh blow to many terrorist organizations like Lashkar.
Sayyad, don't ask who I am.
Just listen carefully.
I know who's behind the incident that took place in Delhi.
Freddie Khambatta. - Agent Vinod, sir.
I would like to show you something.
Am I making myself clear? - Yes.
Lashkar is the most active group these days.
Yes.
The Zeus group doesn't want any publicity.
No comebacks.
I will cover my footsteps.
But what's the guarantee that you will spare me..
.. after the job's done?
There'll be 25 million Euros in your bank.
You take care of that.
And let us take care of the world.
Cheers. - Cheers.
What is this?
Why are you showing this to me?
My granddaughter shows me such videos on Youtube.
Smart idea.
You would've exploded the bomb in Delhi.
And the world would've thought..
.. that a group like Lashkar is behind it.
So Colonel used people like Abu, Kazan, Jimmy and Huzefa.
Put the stamp of Jehad on the operation.
You wanted to trigger a war between both countries..
.. and make millions.
Fascinating theory, Agent Vinod.
But why did you get this here?
Take it to the press.
It'll be fun for a few days.
But now you must excuse me.
I need to.. attend a function.
The Zeus group.
Great businessmen like you.
Senators, ex-prime ministers.
I've heard that whenever you meet..
.. something strange occurs somewhere in the world.
Some President's death in a plane crash.
A civil war in a small country.
Nuclear blast in New Delhi.
Wow.
Wow, Agent Vinod.
Wow.
You think you know everything.
But I want to add to your knowledge.
A bomb blasts in Delhi.
But the real explosion happens in the stock exchanges of New York..
.. London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Beijing
You would short stocks and make your billions.
But what about the millions that die in both the countries?
What about them?
You know what would've happened to China..
.. if the stock market had crashed?
How NATO would've seized Pakistan's nuclear bombs?
And we could have solved the Iran pipeline situation
These are complex issues.
You are a police officer.
It's beyond your understanding.
You will have to die. Sir Metla.
Today.
You're here to kill me.
I won't kill you, sir.
You're a hero in my country.
And you'll die as a hero.
There'll be roads built in your name.
Stamps issued.
Books written about you..
Goodbye, sir.
Sir Metla will be back soon.
Won't you sit down, sir?
Coffee, please.
What's he doing? - Second cup of coffee, sir.
Sir Metla.
Sayeed Kousar has sent his regards.
Who? - Lashkar, sir.
Bismillah.
It appears that Sir Metla was killed by the same terror group..
.. that planned a nuclear attack in New Delhi.
It was Sir Metla's heroic intervention that..
.. thwarted the well laid plan.
Our correspondent Marge Atkins is at the site.
Tell us what is happening Marge..
I know you.
You are Freddie Khambatta.
I don't like that name.

Krishna is a happy-go-lucky Tamilian (Telugu in Telugu version) who works in Mumbai. He is originally from Coimbatore (Rajahmundry in Telugu version). He spends his time searching for his dream girl. He wants his life partner to have a good education and possess supermodel looks. He does not want a country girl for a wife. His grandmother is on her deathbed, and his father wants him to get married. His father, with the aid of his grandmother, chooses a girl from their village named Muthampatti (Vetapalem in the Telugu version). He tries many times to stop the marriage, but nothing works. He marries the girl, Devi, unwillingly. He tries to get rid of her and shifts to a new house to hide her from his friends.

After moving to the new house, Devi changes in personality, surprising Krishna. He unwillingly takes her to a film festival where, to his shock, she dances and calls herself Ruby. She attracts the attention of Bollywood superstar Raj Khanna. Krishna inquires about the house with his neighbours. To his disbelief, he learns about the past owner, a girl called Ruby. She was an actress who was supposed to debut with Raj. Another actress replaced her, which caused her to fall into depression and commit suicide in that very house. He finds out that Ruby possessed his wife. Ruby gets an acting offer for the third sequel of Revolver Raja with Raj, and she forces Krishna to let her attend every rehearsal. Eventually, Krishna makes a deal with her to end this after one movie. Through the filmmaking process, which involves Krishna lying to Devi, Krishna begins to appreciate his wife and falls in love with her. Ruby and Krishna also become close friends.

At the movie release, Krishna praises Ruby for her excellent acting, but she betrays him and does not leave Devi's body as promised. Krishna tries to make her leave by exposing her in the press conference, but she tricks him. At that point, Raj also proposes to her. She faints, and they rush to the hospital. The doctor reveals that Devi is pregnant with Krishna's child. Krishna begs Ruby to leave his wife's body, and Ruby obeys. The movie ends with Krishna and Devi happy together, while we see Ruby's name on a name tag in a trash bin disappear.

In the Tamil and Telugu versions, after a few years, Krishna and Devi live happily and have a child by the time. Krishna goes out to work, but Ruby possesses him, whose name tag is back. This scene sets the stage for the sequel.

In the Hindi version, Raj is swarmed by his fans asking for an autograph, and in the midst of all, he recognizes a hand stretched out, asking for his autograph. He asked for her name, and she answered, ""Ruby.""",2674,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt6041458.srt","""Tutak tutak""

You have to be married in 48 hours.
Has your dad
ordered a bride on Flipkart?
Do you think I will do it?
So, you're going to

My dream has come to nought.
I don't like her at all.
What will you do about that?
Think of something.
What if she rejects you?
Forty-three.
Ninety...
You want to marry me.
Do you know Hindi?
If you want to live in Mumbai,
you have to know Hindi.
Do you know Hindi?
Yes, I know Hindi.
My mother is from Uttar Pradesh.
My father hails from this village.
I speak Hindi better than Tamil.
What a twist!
You don't know him.
You should see how he parties.
Whiskey...
Cigarettes...
Ladies...
If you still want to marry him...
It's up to you.
Punchline.
I am worried for you.
You can still refuse to marry him.
Oh no! Her mother!
This man is a drunkard.
He wanted to hit our cows.
You told us that
when you refused to marry him.
But he cares about you.
You won't find
a better life partner.
Alcohol damages the liver...
But he is good at heart.
I had told you.
She's a nice girl.
I will offer a coconut
at the temple.
Hey! Nuisance!
She had rejected me, but your
stupid idea spoiled everything.
Look, the wedding
can't be cancelled,
but can be postponed.
- How?
If a member of
a close-knit family dies,
no weddings are held for a year.
Yours is a close-knit family,
right? - Who will die?
Your grandmother.
She doesn't seem to want to die.
She will die.
Hey!
God!
[OTHER LANGUAGE]
You're so lucky, sir.
Her pulse rate is normal now.
- Really!
[OTHER LANGUAGE]
[OTHER LANGUAGE]
[OTHER LANGUAGE]
[OTHER LANGUAGE]
'So, Krishna...'
'What about you?'
'Nothing can stop
this wedding now.'
Mom.
- Take care.
Take care of yourself.
Goodbye.
Mind-blowing luck, my friend.
There's no escaping this now.
This is what I get
for being a friend.
Bananas.
Come on.
Amusing!
That's the India I'm looking for.
Can you pose?
- What? Excuse me.
What is happening here?
- Sorry.
Same t-shirt.
Alright. I should...
- Hey!
What do I do with her?
Take her home.
I told my friends I'd marry
a modern girl. I'll get rid of her.
What! Where will the poor...
- I am the poor one.
What should we do?
Find another house to rent.
Take them.
Returning from your village?
She's from a village.
I'm from Germany.
Yeah, right.
I'm going to your house.
Find a house soon.
Come on.
Walk ten steps behind me.
Why?
That's how
husbands and wives walk in Mumbai.
[Background music]
Wait.
Hello?
- I found a great flat.
Rs 15000 per month. In Matunga.
Fully furnished.
Should I finalise the deal?
Okay.
Message the address.
Advance?
You pay.
- You...
Excuse me.
Where is Green Gift building?
That one there.
Go there.
Which flat?
- 205.
205!
Sir, the new tenants.
They are a married couple.
- Hello.
1st floor, 205.
He has told you
about the house, right?
Yes, I told them.
Okay, sir.
- Okay.
No lift?
Sir, please give me the key.
Sir, this is the flat.
Excuse me.
What is this?
You took the rent in advance.
You should've cleaned it at least.
You got such a huge flat
for that amount.
Be happy, sir.
Here.
- Thank you, sir.
Okay.
I'll get some food. Stay here.
It's our house. Come in.
- What!
Of course, you are here.
Who cleaned the house?
I did.
On your own?
- Yes.
Can't believe it.
Don't you require help?
There's no need. I'll manage.
The food is ready. Eat it.
You cooked food?
I cooked with
what I brought from the village.
You didn't make pudding?
What food is this!
Not fit for humans.
I won't eat.
- Yes.
South Indian food in Mumbai!
'Sambar, 'rasam', curd rice.
Oh, come on!
If you have to, cook...
Cook continental food,
Chinese food, butter chicken...
Cook good food.
How do you put up with this?
- Wait!
Go back to the village
and learn how to cook those dishes.
Take your time. Go.
Manchurian!
'Roti'.
Why didn't you bring this earlier?
Did you want to eat it alone?
We won't eat...
Mind-blowing! Try it!
Which flat?
Hi.
205.
Bachelor.
Bachelor.
Krishna.
I'm single now.
Krishna!
Grandma!
What happened? Krishna!
Krishna! Get up!
Grandma!
- Help him up.
What's wrong? Get up. Krishna.
Grandma!
What?
Too late.
Are these fresh?
- Yes.
Are you new to the area?
- Yes.
Which flat?
- 205.
I live with my husband.
- Madagascar.
No manners.
How much for the cabbage?
Hello!
Yeah, Krishna here.
Gurpreet. Take an extra pass.
Hey, take your passes.
Thank you.
- Krishna, your passes.
I don't want them.
- Have you lost it?
Our company
is sponsoring film awards.
We will get to see the film stars
up close and personal.
There'll be an after party too.
Models, actresses...
They speak in English,
without grammar mistakes.
Once you get on the dance floor,
you're sure to impress
one at least. - No.
I'm not in the mood.
Don't worry.
You'll find a modern girl.
You didn't just shift
out of the house, you've changed.
You're coming to the show.
Superstar Raj Khanna will be there.
People are crazy about him.
Did you hear his new song?
Great music! Great song too!

Coffee.
What is this?
My company is sponsoring an
awards' show. Passes to the show.
May I go with you?
It was the first time
you asked for something,
that is why I agreed.
Listen carefully.
At the venue, we won't be together.
We'll sit separately.
After the function,
you'll go to the ladies toilet,
I'll go to the gents toilet.
After everyone leaves,
we'll go home. Okay?
Not one question.
This is good.
That was later.
He had chicken-pox at this age.
Here.
Such a cartoon!
Krishna.
You said you wouldn't be here.
Moving on to the next category...
Nominations for Best Director
for Truedeal Awards 2016 are...
'What...'
'Where is she sitting?'
Thank you.
I didn't make this film alone.
Raj supported me a lot.
He's like my brother.
Thank you, Raj.
What an award...
Place where hard work...
The girl sitting next to you
is gorgeous.
Seems like a village girl
and is here alone.
'Best Film of the year...'
- Exchange seats with me.
You're not interested, let me...
- Hey!
Just because she's alone,
you'll behave like this?
Stop it. Respect women.
It could be your friend's wife.
Could we have on stage,
the chairman of Truedeal...
He's not interested,
he won't let us enjoy either.
And the Best Actor goes to...
Raj Khanna...
For Revolver Raja 002.
Everyone has dreams.
But dreams come true for those
who work to realise their dreams.
I was one in a crowd,
then one in thousands...
And today...
I am one in a million.
Super, sir.
- So, go for your dreams...
No matter what.
In life,
play your role with dedication.
Even after the curtain falls,
the applause will continue.
Come on.
Raj Khanna...
I've seen all his movies.
I'm a huge fan.
What are you doing here?
- Just hanging out.
Let's go to the party.
I'm tired. I'll go home.
Are you crazy? You're refusing to
go for the party?
Don't insist!
I told you I'm tired.
What's with him?
- Yes.
'Where is she going?'
'To the after-party!'
You took that seriously, right?
- Yes.
Just for gags. Come on.
- You're too much.
Lift!
Oh gosh!
My wife!
""Hey ya.""
""Dance like this...""
""Like Sridevi.""
""Dance like this...""
""Like Sridevi.""
""I'm in Bollywood.
My story is unique.""
""My youth entices one and all.""
""Shake it.""
""Baby.""
""Dance like this.""
""Sing like this.""
Who is she?
Don't know, sir.
""Yeah.""
""Yeah.""
""Yeah.""
""Money, money, money, money.""
""I am popular everywhere I go.""
""My beauty is magical.""
""I am like a shining star.""
""Stay around and clap your hands.""
""Dance like this.""
""Sing like this.""
""Check it out, yo.""
""Rhythm on the bass, man.""
""Jump it up.""
""Dance like this...""
""Like Sridevi.""
""Dance like this.""
""Sing like this.""
What... Oh no...
What?
What did you do to me?
What! You're asking me!
My sari is torn.
I thought you were a decent man.
You... Your sari... You think I...
Then what?
Where did you take me?
What did you give me?
I have a headache.
Forget that.
Come on.
No.
I'll bathe first,
and recite a holy verse ten times.
Only then will I start the day.
Hey! Right.
Ramu, call ma'am here.
Ramu!
- Excuse me.
Who is the ma'am?
I am Mr Raj Khanna's manager.
Sir has sent me here.
Call ma'am here.
There's no ma'am here. Please go.
Hey, ma'am...
Ma'am.
The industry is talking about ma'am
and you...
Call her here.
- Wrong address.
There's just a 'sir' here,
no 'ma'am'.
Okay? Please.
Last night, ma'am took a taxi
from the hotel and came here.
I had a hard time convincing the
taxi driver to give me the address,
and you say she isn't here.
Call her out.
I told you she's not here.
If she's here, where is she?
I am here.
Ma'am.
I am fortunate indeed.
What a performance it was!
What a smile!
You dance so well, so graceful.
I have two groups for you,
on WhatsApp.
'Future Sridevi',
'Future Madhuri Dixit'.
Everyone in the industry
wants to sign you for a film,
but who got here first?
Dilip Kukreja, star secretary.
- Excuse me.
Stop this nonsense!
Come out.
- Shut up! Get lost!
Who is this mad man? We're talking
and he's interrupting us.
He is...
- Hey, mister!
My manager.
What!
Manager! - Manager!
You appointed one already!
Superb, ma'am. Very good, ma'am.
I...
- Hey, Get up.
Get up, I say.
Can't you show some respect?
Mad fellow.
Ma'am, Mr Khanna has decided,
in fact he insists
that you will be the lead actress
in his next film.
Actress!
Yes.
- Leave!
Sir has said
that if you refuse to do the film,
he won't act in it.
Please, ma'am.
Okay, ma'am?
I'll think about it.
Super, ma'am. That is enough.
I'll call Mr Khanna and tell him.
Hello, sir. Ma'am has agreed.
We'll have her sign on Friday
and start shooting immediately.
You speak to her.
Hold on.
Ma'am, Mr Raj Khanna.
Hello?
- Hi.
I saw you at
the award function last night.
It was proved
that stars
are meant to shine bright,
and are visible to the world.
Welcome to the world of dreams.
You're lucky.
- You too.
See you on the sets.
Thank you, ma'am.
What is your problem?
You're sitting on a gold mine
and are behaving stupid.
Listen carefully.
I will take care of ma'am's dates,
agreements and finances.
You just act like her manager.
I will give you
5% of the earnings as commission.
Commission?
You'll give it to me! Hey...
What?
You want a share in the profits?
I'll send a car here on Friday.
Bring ma'am to the location.
I'll manage the rest.
The producer, Sharma...
He'll find the address and
come here to sign ma'am for a film.
What!
- If he comes here...
Like you told me, no one lives
here, bachelors share this house.
Tell him that with confidence.
He's foolish. He'll believe you.
The car will be here
at 10 on Friday.
Who were you talking to?
What?
You haven't had a bath yet?
What?
Have a bath
and recite the holy verse 5 times.
Alright?
Hey!
What do you think?
Are you fooling me?
You dance.
You wear skimpy clothes.
You speak in English.
You change every minute.
Why are you doing this?
What is the plan?
Are you an undercover cop?
Say something.
I understand.
- What do you understand?
You don't like me.
She is...
'Don't walk close to me.
Don't sit with me.'
I thought things would change.
You want to throw me out of the
house by accusing me of all this.
Hey! Me!
Don't take the trouble. I'll go.
You be happy.
Excuse me.
Why are you calling your father?
Not my father,
I'm calling your father.
What did I say to you?
This is normal in a family.
Cook food.
Go.
Cook some food.
What?
You don't want me
to go to the village?
No.
Not now.
Hello, sir.
When I asked you the address,
seemed like you wanted to say
something about Flat 205.
Sir, you rented the house
without inquiring about it.
What?
A girl named Ruby lived there.
She was a model.
She wanted to be an actress.
It's not easy.
She was a nice girl.
She stayed aloof.
She suffered from depression,
I think.
She committed suicide.
The police was here.
A case was registered.
The house was locked
till you rented it.
What did you hear?
Ghost stories.
Why?
Those are just stories.
There are no ghosts.
Tinkling of anklets...
A touch...
It's not true.
You are educated.
Don't believe all this.
Devi!
What are you doing there?
Watch the TV in the house.
Devi.
I'm talking to you.
Devi.
Devi.
De...
Ruby.
What happened?
A dream.
Don't you have to go to office?
Get ready. I'll bring coffee.
Ruby.
Ru...
Our Father in heaven.
Holy is Your name.
Our Father in heaven.
Who is Ruby?
A colleague is getting married.
Should I give him gold or a ruby?
Let's go.
Where?
- Picnic.
A Mumbai tour.
Why?
Surprise.
Yes.
- For how many days?
4-5 days.
Pack everything.
So many things for 4-5 days?
Will you get ready now?
You won't understand.
Please.
Are you here?
Yes, that's the address.
I'm coming.
Are you ready?
I'm coming.
The boot...
- I'll keep it.
Devi!
Devi!
Devi!
The bags are back on the cupboard.
What's wrong?
You didn't go to work?
You changed?
You were getting ready,
weren't you?
Why? Where are we going?
For a holiday.
Oh! For how many days?
Huh!
Many days.
Should I pack everything?
Yes.
Please...
Yes.
And...
That one too.
Hurry up.
The luggage...
- Let's go.
Careful.
Stay here. I'll be back.
Did anyone
take the luggage upstairs?
No, sir.
What happened?
You didn't go to work?
Listen...
No, no.
Sir...
Ma'am...
Sir, I... Ghost...
Sir.
Sir.
Sir!
Sir, please.
Sir! Sir!
Sir!
'In my house...'
How...
Are you ready?
Coffee.
Take it.
What is this?
He's the one.
My wife.
Who are they?
They are here
to conduct a prayer ritual.
These people perform
prayer rituals!
If we'd told father,
he would've sent a priest.
There was no time. Get coffee.
- Cof...
Sir...
Has the ghost left?
Huh?
It has gone.
It won't come back, will it?
Test.
What?
Ruby.
Ruby.
Why are you calling the ghost back?
Sorry.
""Dance, dance, dance, dance.
I love the way you dance.""
""Dance, dance, dance, dance.""
""Dance, dance, dance, dance.""
""I love the way you dance.""
""Dance, dance, dance, dance.""
""Dance, dance, dance, dance.""
""I love the way you dance.""
""Dance, dance, dance, dance.""
""Dance, dance, dance, dance.""
""I love the way you dance.""
Help!
This is my house.
You came here without
my permission,
but you cannot leave now.
What do you want?
Why have you possessed Devi?
I was a struggling actress.
After years of struggle,
I got a chance
to act with Raj Khanna.
It would've been
the debut film for both of us.
But I was thrown out of the film.
If I had acted in that film,
I too, would've been
a star like Raj Khanna.
Anger, frustration, depression.
One wrong decision...
All my dreams were shattered.
God has given me an opportunity,
through Devi,
to show the world who Ruby is.
No one can stop me
from acting in the film.
If anyone tries to,
I will ruin that person's life.
Devi!
Movie!
I won't accept that.
I didn't ask for your permission,
I stated my decision.
I won't disturb Devi in the house.
You cannot disturb Ruby
outside the house.
Tomorrow at 10 am, Raj Khanna
will send a car to pick me up.
It's your responsibility
to take Devi out of the house.
Me!
You're my manager, after all.
What's wrong?
You haven't slept yet?
Want something to eat?
What?
Who are you now?
What are you saying?
It's late.
Go to sleep.
What's wrong?
You are pacing about.
Don't you have to go to office?
- No, ma'am.
I have cooked only for myself.
If I knew...
- Krishna!
It's 10!
Will you take Devi out or should I?
I can make okra, but you don't like
it, so I can cook something else.
Nothing.
- What?
Where?
- Picnic.
You always say we'll go,
but we never go.
Let me take my clothes.
Wait. Listen.
""Get a reason to live.""
""Make life colourful.""
""Soar high in the sky.""
""Enjoy every moment.""
""Don't stop.""
""Live life to the fullest.""
She's not an actress.
She's my wife.
She's possessed by a spirit.
Listen...
She's not an actress.
She's my wife.
She's possessed by a spirit.
- Please drive faster.
Yes, ma'am!
'He can't hear me.'
'She must've done something.'
""Colour, beauty...""
""Colour, beauty...""
""This world is beautiful.""
""I want to rule the world.""
""There's beauty all around.""
""Let me admire the beauty.""
- Welcome.
""Get a reason to live.""
""Make life colourful.""
So, ladies and gentlemen...
Here is the lead actress
of Revolver Raja 3, Ruby Singh.
We should've signed her
for our film.
We missed it.
Wow!
She's gorgeous.
- Who?
The actress.
She's the next superstar.
She's not an actress.
She's my wife.
She's possessed by a spirit.
You can't hear me, can you?
Not Hema Malini, Sridevi.
Lights!
First shot!
All in.
It's Lady Luck.
A beautiful woman wins hearts.
An intelligent
woman wins accolades.
A woman who has
beauty and brains...
Wins the world.
Cut it!
Superb, sir! Superb!
You're a star.
I know.
Born star.
Reborn star.
Sir...
What a pair!
Super hit. Mind-blowing.
I already have the feeling that
the film will be a super duper hit.
Hail Goddess!
Hail Goddess!
- Dilip.
Yes?
The film industry
is a dazzling world.
Yes, sir.
The lights you see here...
There's darkness behind them.
The journey from the darkness
into the light
is a short journey.
But often this short journey
takes years to complete.
It took me 14 years.
Many a time,
it may take a lifetime.
What a profound thought!
A lifetime.
You're right, sir.
I have always rejected offers
to act in romantic films.
But...
For the first time,
I didn't want the scene to end.
I know what you mean.
Hail Goddess!
You're a rockstar, sir.
I'll be back.
Krishna!
It's done, right?
Where's ma'am?
We have to go.
- Krishna, wait.
It's not done.
The good times
have just begun.
- What?
I will get film offers. Ma'am
will sign them and you'll enjoy.
Sign! - Mr Khanna wants ma'am
to sign a three-film contract.
Three! You had said one film.
I won't accept
the three-film offer.
Sorry, sir.
I feel very sorry for you.
Who are you to refuse?
Are you her husband?
Mr Khanna has spoken to Ms Singh.
Take the contract and get it back
tomorrow after she has signed it.
Go!
Contract!
- Go!
Stupid man!
She agreed to a contract!
Taxi!
2 minutes.
Come on.
- But...
Fast.
Go.
Hey!
Hey!
Hello, Miss Ruby Singh.
How dare...
The manager said you agreed
to a three-film contract.
Don't sign this contract...
The key...
What contract?
Nothing.
My manager asked me
to sign a two-year contract.
I don't know if I should.
Where did we go?
To the park, the beach...
We did?
I don't remember anything.
Where we went, what we did...
How can I not remember anything?
I told you...
I don't understand.
I want ghosts.
- What?
I want food.
Didn't you eat anything?
No. Please cook some food.
Give me 10 minutes.
I'll cook something.
Sign it.
What is it?
Contract.
'I, Ruby the ghost,'
'will not possess Devi's body
after this film.'
What the hell!
'I won't possess Devi's body ever
again, whatever the circumstances.'
What kind of a contract is this!
My contract.
Point number three.
'I, Ruby the ghost, accept that'
'I won't do any intimate scenes
with Raj Khanna'
'or rape scenes with the villain.'
Strictly no.
Point number 4...
No smoking. No drinking.
Point number 5...
'I won't use any super powers.'
And...
What?
- Especially,
on the gentleman Krishna.
Swear by God and sign it,
Ruby, the ghost.
Have you gone mad?
- A little.
An actress has to do all that.
You are an actress,
but the body is Devi's.
You ant a ghost to sign a contract?
The ghost wants to act, right?
I won't sign it.
I won't accept.
Hey!
Are you not afraid anymore?
Do you and Devi
want to live peacefully or not?
This is the last day then.
Devi won't leave the house
from tomorrow.
You said you wouldn't possess
Devi in the house.
If you want Devi
to leave the house,
you have to sign the contract.
Sign it.
I am.
Lazy ghost.
There's a problem.
Ruby refuses to sign
the three-film contract.
Good.
Yes, sir.
Even I thought that face...
And three films...
I thought you were...
Tell the director
to wrap up the film quickly.
Yes, sir. We'll send her packing.
Ruby won't act in films
after marriage.
What?
Super decision.
Super pairing, sir.
Both of you
will look great together.
Congratulations, sir.
I'm so happy.
Rockstar.
Ready.
1 2 3 4
Wow!
- Hey!
Excuse me.
Hello, Baby Rajinikanth.
Who are you?
- Heroine's manager.
You're the manager,
not the heroine, right?
What are you doing here?
You know what this is.
Dance is a form of worship.
Dancing is an art.
Do you know the ABCD of dance?
Do you know how to dance?
Get out of here.
""It's bad.""
""It's dangerous.""
Michael Jackson's ghost!
Here's another ghost.
This is an indoor shoot.
Close the umbrella.
Rehearsals?
No rehearsals.
Let's take.
Steps?
Hit step, Farah.
This one again?
Evergreen, Farah, evergreen.
He knows just this step.
Energy, guys, energy.
- Mind-blowing.
Ready? Taking!
Are there children in the film?
No.
Why are there
children's clothes here?
These are the heroine's clothes.
- Heroine... Look...
Are you kidding me?
What is all this?
She should be covered
from top to bottom.
Be careful, I say.
Yes.
There is no top or bottom.
Ma'am asked you
to stay out of here.
Go.
Darn it!
Rehearsals!
Look, look.
Don't look.
Why?
How dare you object!
She looks se... In a modern dress.
She looks beautiful.
She is a beauty queen.
Lucky is the man who will

- Get out!
Get out of here.
Pack up.
Pack up. Out.
Krishna.
Mr Khanna wants to
meet you in his office.
And he expects me to go.
No way!
Hey, Krishna. Come.
Come here.
Sit.
Yes, sir.
Come here.
Sit.
I want to tell you something.
What?
Raj Khanna, action star.
All that is okay, but...
Love, girl...
- Not right, sir.
I am human too.
- Really?
Superstar.
I've had this problem
since I was in school.
Any girl I liked,
I would write a letter to her,
but never
mustered the courage to give it.
I wrote a letter to Ruby but...
I couldn't give it to her.
You'll give ma'am a letter!
Thank God!
- I won't.
You will.
Krishna...
I won't.
I've expressed my feelings
in this letter.
Give her this letter
and tell her that I love her.
Enough is enough, Mr Khanna.
Take that.
Do you work out that much?
I'm counting on you.
Mr Khanna.
And...
Don't tell anyone.
Thank you.
Devi...
Devi!
Devi.
- Devi.
De...
Krishna...
Dad.
Dad.
You brought them here? - Yes.
Why do you keep your phone off?
I called you so many times.
What's wrong with Devi?
She walked up the stairs,
without meeting us.
She did?
- Yes.
She did.
- Yes.
Why? We've been
married for so long. - Krishna.
Krishna. - You didn't
come to meet us even once.
On the first floor. Take your time.
What's wrong?
Devi.
- Yes?
What? - Your parents and my dad
are downstairs.
You didn't greet them.
They are angry.
You sleep. I'll attend to them.
Devi. They...
I...
- Take this.
What is this?
What are you upset about?
Everyone makes mistakes.
You are... No.
Devi, you should...
Hug them.
- Mom.
Happy family! Very good.
I'll take that.
Please come in. Mom.
Take that.
Let's go.
In the room.
I don't know how you did it,
but for the first time,
you've done something good.
I swear, it was a mistake.
Hello.
- Sir, the car is ready.
Ma'am won't come today.
Why? What's wrong?
Ma'am is not well and I am mad.
Go to sleep.
Sorry. I'll never bathe again.
Ruby!
Ruby!
Where are you going?
- Raj Khanna is here.
Raj Khanna!
I am a huge fan.
Raj Khanna...
Come on. Raj Khanna is here.
Raj Khanna is here.
Ruby!
- Raj Khanna.
Raj Khanna.
- Do you know where Ruby lives?
Listen...
Excuse me.
Does anyone know
where the actress Ruby lives?
I have come here...
- Raj Khanna.
Ruby...
Devi, come here quickly.
Okay, but I am here...
Mom, it's Raj Khanna!
Ruby's house is here.
- Sir, what are you doing?
Sir, look over there.
Autograph please.
The crowd is getting rowdy.
Let's go.
Sir, please. Let's go.
Are you alright?
- Yes.
Please come.
- Raj Khanna.
Let's go, sir.
Let's go.
Bye.
He's calling.
Hello?
Hello, how is ma'am?
Fine.
Give the phone to ma'am.
Sir wants to speak to her.
She's sleeping.
You said she was fine.
Can't a person who is fine
not sleep?
Let her sleep.
She has to shoot
a scene with sir tomorrow.
Let her rest.
The car will be there at 9.
Why have you lost weight?
- No.
I don't go to the gym
and no home food.
You should come here.
I can cook for an extra person.
Devi. Devi.
I...
- Listen...
She's a gem of a person.
And you don't like her!
Devi, come here.
Where?
Ruby.
What?
They want you to shoot tomorrow.
Our family is here for a week.
How can I take Devi out...
Listen...
You know how it is.
That is your problem.
Tomorrow's shoot
is cancelled. Okay?
That is your problem too.
They will come here
and you will have to
deal with that.
What do I do? You are a ghost.
Do something to make them go away.
But that was not a clause
in the contract.
Good, you're dead.
Else I would've killed you.
Hey!
Friends.
Please do something.
Hey, what did you do?
Who are you?
What are you looking at?
Scoot!
What's wrong?
- See for yourself.
I don't get to spend time with you.
What are you doing? It tickles.
They came here, met us,
they should leave now.
We are newly-weds.
We need privacy.
Devi...
Listen, let's do something.
Till they are here,
we'll go somewhere else.
Be ready at 9. We'll go.
In fact...
We should leave now.
Wait.
Ask them what they'll eat.
Okay.
Listen...
Who?
What would you like to have?
Tell me.
Who is it at this hour?
That man...
Yes.
You should've stayed longer.
Really?
But...
- Wait.
What's the hurry?
- Listen...
Taxi cancelled.
- You can leave in some time.
Give this to him.
[OTHER LANGUAGE]
Let's go.
Let's go.
You won't come downstairs.
She'll wave bye from the kitchen.
Okay.
Go to the kitchen.
[OTHER LANGUAGE]
Action!
Raj!
Ouch!
- Hey, Ruby!
Oh no.
Ouch!
- Are you okay?
It's paining.
She's injured.
She's just pretending.
Over reacting.
One more.
Another retake?
- It's okay.
Roll camera.
- Rolling.
Action!
Sir, he's hitting him for real.
- Quiet.
Looks real.
He's hitting him badly.
- Realistic.
Steady cam, follow me. Come.
No, sir...
If even one tear
falls from her eyes...
What an angle!
Revolver Raja 3.
It's not an action film.
It's a romantic film.
What?
You're hurt.
I'm hurt?
Where?
- I'm searching.
I'd get injured often.
Move.

Are you Ruby's manager?
We want dates.
A five-film contract.
You may come here to meet me,
but don't discuss Ruby's dates.
I gave the rights for this film.
Go away!
Did you give Ruby the letter?
No.
- Why?
Ma'am's dream, this film...
Full concentration.
If I give her the letter,
she will be disturbed. - Then?
Finish the film soon.
I will give her the letter then.
Raj...
Sir, good behaviour till then.
Good behaviour!
- Even if the director says...
Don't touch. Keep a safe distance.

from the heroine,
the closer the heroine will get.

The next...
Yes!
I'll see you.
Yes.
You look happy.
The film is done. You'll go.
Happy journey.
The shoot is done.
The film hasn't released.
I have the contract.
You are under control.
Let me see it.
Does it say I'll leave
after the shoot is over?
My dream is to see
myself on the screen.
How can I go?
Grow up, man.
This is not good.
Sir...
Yes, Krishna?
When will the film be released?
In two months.
Two months!
Why? The shoot is over.
Release it tomorrow. Or...
Why two months?
The shoot is over.
Release it tomorrow.
Please, sir. You can do it.
- How is it possible?
Only you can do it.
- Not possible.
Nothing is impossible. Please.
Hey...
- Please.
Technical problem.
You don't get it.
Nonsense!
What technical problem?
Hey you! Hey!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Hello! Stop!
He's gone.
I tried to stop them, but they
took her away. - Where's ma'am?
They took ma'am.
Let's go.
Amazing story.
Hey!
- Hear the narration.
You will like it.
Raj, your film is over.
Now, I can sign her.
Listen...
If I see you around Ruby...
If a tear falls from her eye...
Come।
Follow me.
Devi?
What's wrong?
I don't know what's
happening to me.
I don't remember anything.
Where I go, what I do.
My head hurts.
Nothing is wrong.
No.
It must be a fatal disease.
I don't think I'll live long.
I told you, nothing is wrong.
If anything happens to me...
I want you to be happy.
You should remarry.
A girl of your choice.
Why did you say that?
Nothing will happen to you.
I won't let anything happen.
Don't think too much.
Go to sleep.
Hello.
Is the film releasing?
Yes, it's been difficult.
The struggle...
Could I get two tickets?
There's a special show
for people from the industry.
Get the tickets from the office.
Thank you, sir.
Yuck!
I spoke to the manager.
He said I'd get two tickets.
You don't need tickets
to watch the show, Krishna.
Did you give the letter to Ruby?
Yes. Yes, I did.
It's here. I'll give it to her
after the film is released.
I promise.
You don't need to.
Decision changed?
- Yes.
I won't tell her.
I'll tell the world.
At the press conference.
Raj weds Ruby.
And you are my best man.
Don't tell Ruby.
It's a surprise.
Worst man.
Ruby won't be there
after the film is released.
He'll announce
it at the press meet.
I will.
We will be back.
Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby!
Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby!
Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby!
Congratulations.
You're amazing.
Actually, I'm very lucky.
I have a surprise for you.
I'll tell you
at the press conference.
Who are you?
How you look...
I don't know.
I'm sure about one thing.
If you were alive,
you would've been very successful.
Great performance.
Here comes the new sensation.
The heroine of Revolver Raja 003,
Miss Ruby.
You shouldn't have ended your life.
But I am happy,
that through Devi,
you could live your dream.
Can we please have you on stage,
Miss Ruby?
Wear this sari.
Devi and I will go.
We will leave.
Sir.
- Just go and check where she is.
Yes, sir.
Where?
Home.
I won't go.
Hey!
Don't joke. Don't play.
You saw yourself on screen.
You'd said you'd leave.
Go now.
Wear this.
Please.
Didn't you see...
People were shouting my name.
They were praising me.
They applauded my performance.
Think before you speak.
What should I think?
About why I trusted you
or why I allowed this?
You've signed a contract.
Hey...
Devi and her life...
Devi...
Who is Devi?
There's nothing between you two.
You want to get rid of her.
If I use her body,
how will it matter to you?
Go if you want to.
I won't go anywhere.
Ma'am, what are you doing here?
People are waiting for you.
Mr Khanna is on stage already.
Everyone is waiting.
The media people, photographers...
Let's go.
""Ruby, she's here.""
""Put your hands together for Ruby.""
""Ruby, she's here.""
Welcome, everyone.
This is an important day
for our film.
This...
- Hey, stop this nonsense!
Stop it.
Ruby...
Stop it.
She is...
What is he saying?
What is he doing?
What is he doing?
His voice...
Just gestures...
No one can hear him.
Is he okay?
Is he a fan?
What is he doing?
He's saying something.
Sir, people are going mad
after watching our film.
Revolver Raja 3, superhit.
Ruby, next superstar.
Wow! What a manager!
Very good.
This...
Please...
Good evening, everyone.
We make films.
We act.
But when acting turns to reality,
we don't realise.
There's a thin line
between reel life and real life.
I've just realised that.
Ruby is not just my co-star,
but she's the best actor.
Not only is she a good actress,
but is a good human being too.
The best thing that happened
to Revolver Raja.
And of course...
My life.
On this important day,
Ruby and I...
Both of us...
- Ma'am.
Ruby!
- What's wrong?
What happened?
Move aside.
Please.
Sir, the doctor
is calling you inside.
She's fine.
Are you married?
Soon.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
She's pregnant.
Thanks, doctor.
You love ma'am...
But ma'am loves me.
Sorry.
If a single tear
falls from her eyes...
Sir. How is ma'am? Is she fine?
She's pregnant.
Super news, sir.
God...
You're such a rockstar, sir.
You're always rocking, sir.
You didn't tell me.
When did this happen?
When will junior Raj be born?
Hello.
I'll call you.
It's the jewellery shop.
The pendant you'd ordered for
Miss Singh is ready.
What should I do?
Send it.
Where?
Strike my name off
and write Krishna's.
With love.
Why? Sorry, if I can ask.
You won't understand.
You're a real hero.
Amazing! Super!
Ruby.
We wish for many things...
But God's will prevails.
Your life was ruined.
But you don't have the right 'to
ruin others' lives.
I beg you.
Please return Devi to me.
I love her a lot.
Please.
You.
Hospital?
Are you okay?
I...
Is it so bad now?
What am I wearing?
Is it a hospital gown?
It will be the first time
when a husband tells his wife...
What?
You are pregnant.
Devi.
Devi.
- What?
What are you doing?
You brought the clothes from the
terrace, but left the towel there.
I did?
Towel.
What happened?
Yippee!
What happened?
There was a nameplate here.
It had fallen down,
so I threw it away.
Was it important?
It wasn't, was it?
Okay, then.
Raj!
- Raj Khanna.

The film is set in Bathinda, with its thermal power plants and factories in the background. It is based on a true story.

The daughter of an ex-army man discovers that she has a serious life-threatening illness. Gradually they piece together the reason for this and discover that it is due to the carcinogenic elements that have entered the ground water. Everyone in the city is affected by it.

A journalist meanwhile has discovered files that will incriminate the people responsible for this ground water poisoning, but he is kidnapped. His girlfriend, who is also a journalist, pursues the case, trying to convince the authorities to arrest the people responsible.

Meanwhile, a mysterious bomb blast in a business tycoon's factory prompts the state CM to hire an NIA officer. He meets the ex-army man seeking revenge for his dead daughter and the journalist demanding justice for her slain boyfriend. He tries to balance his knowledge of the truth, his wish for a more stable posting (having just come from a Naxal region), a better family life and his conscience.",1074,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt6467738.srt","<i>Those who watch while others burn...</i>

She swims for a good
45 minutes everyday, Doctor.
Non-stop. Every single day.
Today we did an hour,
but I know her strength!
Relax, I think this is something else.
I need to examine her further.
So...
...where were we?
You save your queen.
You see, it starts in the lungs, and
then starts spreading all over the body.
It's a galloping Cancer.
What stage?
It's a pretty advanced stage.
L-low long will she...
I can't be sure.
Maybe a month.
Chemo?
You can try your luck,
but it's like killing a fly with a sword.
Riya...

What have you done?
Riya?
I read the report.
So what? Listen to me.
There are no targets in life.
The real battle is here...

You can't give up.

Tomorrow is another day.
From now on, there's no agenda.
No training.
None of this.
Q Kay-
<i>Okay. . ...</i>
Then let's kill the
fly with the sword tomorrow.
Hey, stop!
Wanna hear a story?
In high school, I had a classmate
who didn't like the way I talked.
During our farewell party...
...| took him to the pool
and dunked him into the water...
...till he was scared shitless.
That's how I've achieved everything.
If you come in my way,
you go down under.
I know everything.
Blood group scam, reverse boring.
I know all about it.
What are you trying to
prove by being James Bond, eh?
That the blood reports
show traces of Uranium?
No one knows jackshit about
Reverse boring in this town.
Ammonium Nitrate
and Chromium are toxic...
...no one cares about all this.
Everyone's on their own trip here.
Taking their wives
out on romantic dinners...
...or taking their girlfriends
out for disco Bollywood nights...
...that is life for them.
The truth is that people here are
now used to drinking this poison...
...and that's good for my business.
And now you know it.
You think you can bury the truth?
Someone's going to expose you soon!
It doesn't end here!
You can't stop this!
You can't stop this!
Praise the Lord!
Praise the Lord!
The funds have already arrived.
You're never late, I must say!
Well, I aim to please!
Keep this.
And give this to that
gentleman there, will you?
Tell him it's from me.
It's a dirty joke.
Sir, that gentlemen sent this for you.
<i>On the path to conquer the throne,
Some of your pawns must die...</i>
<i>If your eyes aim the big kill,
you must learn to eat humble pie.</i>
Ah, what poetry!
Who is this, Gha|ib's Uncle?
He's a motivational speaker.
Looking for funds for his new book.
Don't look back or
he'll latch on to you.
And bug you with his letters.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I would
now like to call upon the Honorable...
Chief Minister of state Ms Braitch
to felicitate Mr Paddy. FSharma,
...the managing director
of PPFPL for his decade...
...long commitment to
sustainable business practices.
Ladies and Gentlemen, the Global
Ten Award goes to Mr Paddy I: Sharma.
Are your legs glued? Get the trophy!
Wonderful, isn't it- Getting
this from your lucky charm, eh!
Thank you.
Thank you everyone.
Bloody criminal!
Sustainable award, huh?
Receiving fancy awards while
you get Anirudh Dutt abducted?
He had all the evidence against you,
that's why you kidnapped him right?
Everyone knows what dirty games...
...you've been playing
behind this glitzy fagade.
I will expose you!
I will expose all of you!
Leave me. Leave me!
Fools rush in where
angels fear to tread.
Shakespeare said it eons ago,
but the curtains are rising now.

I understand only golf and jazz.
So let the jazz begin!
And enjoy the evening.
Move it! Move back please!
We will answer all your
queries but for now move back
l-low did you do it'?
At the Doon School Farewell party,
you pushed Dukki into
the pool, around 7 pm.
Did you save him or did he drown?
There's muck on your collar.
Start the car.
Open the door!
You slung mud at him, right?
Anirudh's bitch!
Your pretty face
will burn in acid now.
You have been playing
sting journalist for too long.
Tonight, you'll be on breaking news!
This isn't a city of big movie heroes.
It's a city buried in ashes.
Anyone can go missing here, anytime.
Everyone wants to fight
their battles with us.
Totally. File a missing complaint.
After all, the law reigns supreme.
Right. But you guys run a
parallel system at PPFPL, don't you?
You get Anirudh out of this!
You know I won't stop at this.
Oh madam,
don't try and act smart, okay?
People literally shit
bricks in front of us.
They shiver, stutter
and break into a cold sweat.
So spare your shenanigans for your
fancy tea parties! Not here, got it!

<i>They say Pm so consumed by you</i>
<i>That I've lost sense of day and night</i>
<i>It's this distance
of Jove that I can't bear</i>
<i>I pine for you as you have</i>
<i>Stolen my nights</i> away
Smile... Smile...
Smile... Smile...
Smile... Smile!
I have a surprise for you!
Let me show you.
and here it is kept...
<i>Oh my beloved...</i>
Come back to me...
<i>MY love!</i>
Come back to me...
<i>As the world ceases to exist</i>
<i>Let's</i> rejoice <i>in</i> our togetherness
Come <i>my</i> beloved
Come <i>my</i> beloved
Come back, <i>my</i> sweet love...
Check, has the motor started?
It's started!
The waste line is on.
Pump the chemical
waste into the ground.
Dispose off the waste into the canal.
And the remaining chemical waste,
dump it into the fields.
Security, what's that machine flying up there?
Stop!
Stop!
Age?
26 years.
Name?
<i>Arﬂrudh Du“.</i>
Any wounds?
5 wounds on the Body
and on the head as well.
Those are just scratches, not wounds.
Count the fingers.
All intact.
Ears?
Intact, sire.
Here, put a stamp on
this and a sheet on him.
Hey, come here fast with the sheets!
Come on, quick!
Cover the body properly.
Hello
Wow, buddy- what a player you are!
The girl slings mud on your face...
...and you send her boyfriend
straight to heaven! Clean bowled!
I'll call you after my meeting.
Cool.
Close your mouth!
Stop eating noisily.
You were born with a set of ten teeth.
Everyone would tell me,
you've given birth to a witch!
And I would say, how can it be'?
She's my flesh and blood!
Bu you actually turned
out to be a monster!
Ate your father whole!
And it still didn't satiate your hunger?
Why did you do it,
why did you kill him!
And now you want to kill me too?
That's the body.
Happy Birthday, Riya.
Excuse me, can I have a light?
Thank you!
It's no coincidence
that you're here, is it?
Absolutely not.
It's a well thought out plan.
L-low do you know about
the Doon school incident'?
Dukki- your childhood buddy
is now a farmer in Bihar.
Your daughter Ivlitali. ..
...EDM is her national anthem.
Who the hell are you?
I'm a writer.
I believe in one shot.
Would you like a cigar?
No thanks.
This is my book, check it out.
If you approve,
you could fund the launch.
Why?
Those who live on ocean shores,
should beware of tidal waves.
Have a look.
You fund so many causes.
You spent 5000 crores
on the Life fountain Lab!
This is a pittance in comparison.
You opened 2 pro><y accounts
for the Life fountain lab, didn't you?
Used Jeetu for it...
Another request.
You must launch the
book with your own hands.
The media is hungry for a scoop.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I call upon Parabjeet Walia to
introduce his book, One Shot!
Thank you, thank you very much.
They say there can
be only one Lion in a forest...
...and only one leader among men.
The rest merely exist...
That's why it's important to grab
the first opportunity and get ahead.
Life doesn't give you many chances.
It's all about one shot.
<i>Mere rabbis-rousing is not my aim...</i>

2 blasts took place
at the PPFPL factory.
The first explosion was minor,
which set off the alarms.
The factory was then evacuated.
The second explosion was humongous,
Considering the intensity of the blast.
The fact that there were
zero casualties draws suspicion.
ls the state witnessing
terrorism again?
So far, no RDX has been found.
But why was the factory evacuated?
We are surrounded
by so many questions...
...and the nation
wants to know the answer!
Ma'am, do you think this was a terrorist
attack? ls there a foreign hand?
No need for all this commotion.
Whatever happened is terrible,
we strongly condemn it.
Investigations are on...
...but at this point we
have no verified information...
...on the involvement
of any terrorist groups.
But I'll make you a promise...
...whoever the culprits are,
we'll nab them before Diwali.
Mefam!
Mefam!
Wait outside.
3O missed calls!
I have other stuff to attend to...
Whoever did this,
had it all planned well in advance.
I'll chase him down right
to where he lives and murder him!
I'm not gonna leave him!
Relax, mister.
I want all my insurance
money in one week flat.
My company is worth 6000 crores.
I want more than that! Got it'?
Look, it's all gonna get sorted.
Since it's a blast, it will
be assumed to be a terrorist attack.
The case is bound to
go to the central government.
I'm not interested in any
of your bureaucratic nonsense.
I want my money. When and hovv will
you get it back, is what I wanna know!
All these platitudes of yours,
keep them for the press.
Okay, calm down.
Come, sit- let's talk.
Tell me.
Have you heard you
the story about the horses?
Just hear me out.
Not all horses are the same,
there are race-horses...
...and there are those
used at marriage processions.
And then there is the
horse of the government...
...which we will now
ride like the groom's horse...
...the louder the wind pipes
will blow, the faster it will trot.
We have this officer, Arjun Ivlishra.
All we need to do is close the files.
It's an open the shut case.
You'll get your money,
no need to stress.
Ride any horse you please...
...but if this isn't fixed,
the next election...
...poster will show a different face
...and the money will
go to someone e|se's account.
Got it?
Don't get so hyper, sir.
Chill out... Trust me,
we'll sort everything.
Why you all are wearing dirty uniforms?
All the donations I give- are they useless?
Go, tell your principal, okay?
Send me a cup of tea.
Update all of them, okay?
Come on in! l-low can I serve you'?
Tea or coffee?
No, thank you.
Ivlanipur, Kargil, Anantnag, eh?
Been through pretty rough waters.
Now you want to relax in
air-conditioned offices, don't you'?
The Prime Minister's office.
Just doing my bit for the family...
Of the family,
for the family, by the family.
That's what democracy is really about.
Surely you know how it is'?
You're absolutely correct, ma'am.
Shut the case, chill and have
a blast this Diwali with your family.
Yes. The case will be shut in a week.
Perfect.
There's just some
problem with evidence...
...but I'm gathering
all the information...
You have information;
give it to the broadcasting ministry.
Let's cut to the chase.
It's an open and shut case.
Just wrap it up and get rid of it,
without a sound.
Yes ma'am.
Good bye.
Good bye.
They have hoarded tons of
money and filled their coffers.
And they can't even
keep a chair inside?
So, what's the price
IPS officers are commanding in
the marriage market nowadays?
<i>2 Groves.</i>
Nice, then you've hit the jackpot!
No sir. I don't think like that.
I will marry the girl I like, not
the one who brings the heftiest dowry.
Actually we need that
change in the country...
And we will bring that change.
Speaking of change...
Do you have change of 500 rupees?
Yes Sir.
Do me a favour, take these 500
rupees and get me a cigarette pack.
Lets blow away your 'change' in smoke!
Change...
As long as the entire system
doesn't change, no one will change.
They are all Scoundrels.
Here, sir.
See, there's your change.
I-Ii. I am Maya. I am a journalist
and I have some classified info...
Hi. I am Maya.
I am a journalist and I have some...
...classified information
that I would like to...
No, no, no...
Hi. I'm Maya. lam ajournalist
and I have some classified...
...information that
I would like to share with you.
I'm sorry I've arrived
at your home unannounced...
...but this will be useful to you.
Maya! Such a nice name, Maya.
Sorry, I shouldn't have
come here unannounced but..
Hmm... Even I wasn't supposed
to be here, but here I am.
Q Kay-
I have this research and
lam sure it will be helpful to you.
Not here...please keep it there
There, right there.
Thank you.
These white collar companies...
While you're at it,
just keep this bottle there as well?
On the right corner. Thank you.
All the muck lurking
behind the facade of these...
...white collar companies,
it's all here for you to see.
And that is PPFPL.
L-low long have you been here Maya'?
Long enough to know that all
the high-rises in this city
Have their foundations
deep below in hell.
Oh. No, I just wanted
to know where do you get...
...the yummiest Chickpea
gravy and bread in town?
You know the kind that...
Please go through that research.
Yeah I will. I will.
Thank you.
Excuse me! Dolphin Chowk has the best
Chickpea gravy and bread in town...
...Just let Sir know.
Yes ma'am.
L-low are you, buddy'?
I'm okay, you tell me?
Same here, life's chugging along.
Are you surely coming
home this Diwali?
Or do I have to cajole
mom to buy me crackers?
I will be there for sure.
Rocket, Anar, Chakri, Deepika bomb,
Katrina bomb, Priyanka bomb...
Ask your mom to sanction
the budget for all of them.
We will burst them together. Okay?
Do call mom once in a while.
She is a nuclear bomb!
Sir, our industry has a fool-proof
trip system for safety.
A safety team came
from Germany to check.
The reactor has been under surveillance
What's your role here, sir?
Sir I am the Main wire here.
You mean chief?
No sir, main wire. lam the only
source and link to the head command!
L-laha. So how old is the plant'?
1 O years
And how long have you been here'?
1 O years
Any major accidents in the past?
Fire outbreak etc?
Nothing sir.
Fire safety?
Sir the whole plant has a definite,
fixed fire...
...installation system,
with fire water pumps.
but when the alarm went off, I don't
know why the safety system failed.
Who was on duty at the time,
near the reactor?
Bhagat Singh. Here sir,
this is the full employee list.
Please call Bhagat Singh.
Sir he is on leave for the last 5 days
due for his wife's cancer treatment.
What are the chemicals
used in the reactor?
It's highly confidential.
Only boss knows.
Just like Grand Ma's recipe, right?
They will take the
secret to their graves.
All American restaurants are just
like that! 'Secret recipe', they say.
Awful food but secret recipe!
Good. Nice meeting you.
Secret recipe...
Keep her under keen observation, okay?
Yes sir.
She's in my circle of suspicion.
Suspicion?
This is a daily affair for them sir.
Ivlartyﬁs day was observed yesterday,
and they're still at it.
Who is the new Martyr in town?
Sir on 17th Nov 1928, when Lala Lajpat
Rai was murdered for protesting...
...against Simon Commission,
Bhagat Singh took his revenge.
Sir whenever I read about
Bhagat Singh, I get goosebumps.
For the deaf to hear,
blasts are needed... He was so right!
For the deaf to hear,
blasts are needed.
Of course.
Sir, but weren't we going
straight to the scene of crime?
Where are you going?
Sir, you came back?
Did you forget something?
I didn't forget.
Just got reminded of something.
As I keep remembering,
I will keep visiting you.
Yes. Yes.
L-low long have you known Bhagat Singh'?
For the past 3 years.
Earlier he was employed in the packaging
unit, got promoted 5 days ago.
Who promoted him?
I did.
Why?
I savv his qualifications. He was a
gold medalist from Punjab University.
One minute.
Please send Bhagat Singh's file.
And he knew all about chemicals.
He'd been after me for a while...
One minute.
Sir, here, this is his certificate.
He was an expert in his field,
so I promoted him.
Please check his bag.
Bag? Why bag? Sir,
you are unnecessarily suspecting me.
Sir, I'm a man of clean character.
Of course,
your character shines in your eyes.
Been flying high, eh?
What is it, Meow-Meow?
Looks like hash, from your fingers.
Shoulcfve at least washed your hands!
Where you were you that day?
This book, Sir. One Shot.
I was at the launch
event with Paddy Sir.
And I recorded a video as well.
Here, listen to the author's speech.
<i>He fumed you, Mr Mukhytaar.</i>
The certificate is fake.
Keep this as evidence.
Sir... Sir this is my phone.
Evidence.
Where did the nail cutter go?
Check inside.
Yes Sir!
Check all the rooms!
Check that bedroom, anything there?
Open it, check properly!
Did you find anything there
Sir what did you just do?
It's for protection from
bad cosmic events.
Here, keep this.
ls it evidence?
No I like the fragrance.
I'm taking it home.
Bow down to God.
Keep this as well.
You want to take this home as well?
This is evidence.
Yes sir
have marked some local phone numbers,
I want to trace their locations.
Let me know when and where
these SIM Cards were used.
Okay Sir!
Didn't I ask you to give
me Bhagat Singh's bio-data?
Yes sir.
Thank you.
Sir, we have traced the SIM,
Location says Nepal Patan.
Inform Nepal authorities, this
man needs to be arrested on sight.
Okay Sir!
Papa when are you coming back?
I defeated Som in a kabaddi match!
Saw the Spiderman movie too.
Are you listening, Papa!
Mummy is getting thinner...
She doesn't eat properly,
I think she's dieting.
And do you know,
her hair is falling too.
Are you there, Papa?
Can you hear me?
ivlaa'm. The prime accused of the case
Bhagat Singh has committed suicide
So bring him back to life.
Dig him out of his grave,
do whatever you must...
But I want his
confession statement.
lvlaa'm I feel...
Shove your feelings
up your backside, okay?
This isn't a bloody
charity organisation!
Gurnaam, who will wash the glass?
Your Dad?
You think the government gives
free meals? I'm gonna spank your ass!
Do as I say, don't make me repeat myself!
Yes, what was I saying...
I need the statement
before the press conference.
Got it?
Yes
<i>WHORE BITCH]</i>
Why are you dragging PPFPL into this?
Because they do ground water contamination
the region that we are in today...
ls now the cancer belt of our country.
Reverse boring is a dangerous
way to dispose chemical waste.
Factories like PPFPL don't
have waste treatment plants...
...so they use this illegal but
convenient method of Reverse Boring.
Thousands of gallons of poison is injected
deep underground through a pipe.
lmagine- the water, the soil,
even the crops...
Everything gets infested with toxins.
And that is chemical contamination.
You can check for yourself,
the infected pumps
have been marked red,
they are banned.
If I get posted there, I'm done for.
When I was shooting my documentary,
I saw for myself.
Every home has a cancer patient.
Where were you that day?
Sir. One Shot. I was at
the launch event with Paddy Sir.
And I recorded a video as well.
<i>Mere rabbis-rousing is not my aim...</i>
<i>The who/e effort is
to make the wheels turn...</i>
<i>Yes, the walls have begun
to tremble like curtains...</i>
<i>But the point is that the foundations
must shake and churn...</i>
<i>If not in my heart,
your heart shall behold...</i>
<i>Wherever the ﬁre be,
but for sure it must burn.</i>
The foundations must shake...
...54321.
What's the deal here?
This the emblem of NSG
Show me Parabjeefs bank details.
This bugger has a clean record, ya!
He sleeps on a pretty hard bed.
Who has been sending these
couplets to Bhagat Singh and why?
<i>The game of death is
clenched in your ﬁst...</i>
<i>The north star looks down at you,
through the skies and mist.</i>
There is definitely a cryptic
code message in this couplet.
Fist...
...V\/hat's in my fist?
The fist is formed
by clenching the 5 fingers.
Five fingers.
Five.
My fist denotes the numerical 5...
A game has players.
Boxing has 2 players.
Volleyball has 5 players.
Basketball has 6
Cricket and hockey have 11 players...
<i>The North star sees you from the sky...</i>
North star means the brightest star..
The North Star is the brightest star.
November is the 11th month...
...Which means... 5.
5th November!
He's quite a cunning rascal!
Fist...
This is smart guy.
Smart gUY-
So I was just doing
some research on you.
We||- 1971 Bangladesh War,
Param Vir Chakra...
...Operation Blue Star in 1984,
NSG Phantom Kargil...
It's an honour to meet you Sir.
Thank you. Not that you're
any less accomplished.
Na><a| operations in Anantnag,
Ivlanipur, Kupwara...
...Candidate for a gallantry award.
Where were you on the 5th of November?
By the way, the Kupvvara
operation- was it real or fake?
5th November. Where where you?
At my book launch.
Prior to that?
If I keep an account of every second,
of every day then..
then I will end up losing my mind.
That's why I don't keep so
many tabs on myself.
Where were you after retirement?
Surely you remember that!
I was seeking divine knowledge
in the company of great poets.
Uh huh.
<i>Those who Watch While others burn,</i>
<i>Your straw houses will soon be graves,</i>
<i>When Winds stoke the flames of death,</i>
<i>How long will you be saved?</i>
<i>I kept quiet when they came for him,</i>
<i>And thus the next turn was mine,</i>
<i>As you stay mum while they murder me,</i>
<i>You're going to be the next in line.</i>
Your poetry is rather...revealing.
That blast too,
wasn't it in one of your poems?
There was some code in that couplet...
<i>The ﬁre in my veins, must run through
yours too... Something like that?</i>
<i>If not in my heart,
your heart shall behold,</i>
<i>The ﬁres must bum...
Right!</i>
It's a verse by the great poet
Dushyant, actually.
In between facing and shooting guns,
I've developed quite a fondness for poetry.
L-low do you know Bhagat Singh'?
Whiskey?
No, I'll have water.
This whole operation
must have cost a bomb.
L-low did you get the money'?
It's safe, bottled.
You have a wife?
Yes.
Girlfriend?
Heh, no.
Ah, that's why you're asking all these
questions without a trace of evidence.
Got kids?
I have a son.
Speak to him often?
Yeah, we spoke just the day before.
He's in Patna, I'm here...
So we speak on the phone.
The next time you speak, ask him
Does he see corpses in his dreams?
Do deathly voices ring in his ears?
Have you got his blood tested?
Your daughter's name is Ria, right?
Yes.
Where is she?
Have you checked your son's nails?
If they're turning yellow?
Where is she?
Are his lips turning blue?
Why did you choose Bhagat Singh?
Does he wake up at night,
screaming and panting?
Does he see dead bodies,
getting sucked into a poisonous swamp?
What bloody swamp
are you talking about?
And stick to answering
what I'm asking you!
This toxic swamp
filled with toxic water.
This... I guess you forgot
this the last time?
What can I say.
It's a professional hazard.
The next time I visit,
get some Single Malt.
I like Single Malts...
And I know you can afford it.
Sir I'm coming from scene of crime
I smell a huge conspiracy here.
Sir, reverse boring,Chemicals
the factory blasts...
This is the wheat bowl of India, Sir...
Which has fallen into
the jaws of a cancer epidemic.
These 3O days of being posted here
has changed my entire thought process!
3O days have changed
your thought process?
You're getting lots of big thoughts?
Stay here for 3 months, all your big
thoughts will get fused like light-bulbs!
Got it?
Sorry Sir!
Don't tell me about your
nonsensical thoughts! Idiot.
I'm so sorry.
Get out
Hello Little Master, what's up?
I'm good Papa.
You're having your medicines, right?
<i>Papa, the hero of Singham gives
the bad guys such a royal thrashing!</i>
Have you ever bashed
up any criminals like that?
Policemen like that only exist in movies,
those who go around giving flying Kicks.
And you stop watching all these films,
just takes you away from reality!
Okay, listen?
Yes?
Do you dream often?
Yeah, of course!
<i>I dream that you've turned into Singham
and are bashing up all the goons!</i>
Goodnight.
Good night papa.
<i>Singham!</i>
Sir, this room is like
a shrine to Paddy Sir.
It's a shining testament
to his honesty and integrity.
It seems you watch a lot of movies!
Yes, first day, first show,
I'm always there at Gazala!
Blood reports?
Yes, all in order! Life Fountain Lab.
They've been tested
at the Chandigarh Lab.
In fact, Paddy Sir organizes
a blood donation camp every 6 months.
When I see his love for the city,
I get really emotional
Do you get emotional or are you terrified?
So, what was the last film
you saw that you really enjoyed?
<i>Singham.</i>
<i>Gosh, this Singham
follows me everywhere!</i>
Yes.
I came to you with all the facts.
I'm the one who lost Anirudh.
And you got me followed? Come on!
You know,
I'm glad that blast happened.
If it were up to me,
I'd blow up Paddy's bedroom.
Watch him e><p|ode to shreds.
You should be scared.
These are some strong
statements you are making.
Looks like you didn't
read any of the research.
If you would've,
you'd be the one getting scared.
Everyone would be clear- who
made this plan, who is the victim.
Everything would be cleared!
L-low brave are you'?
Wait.
This is Anirudh's post-modem report.
The real one.
What classified report
did Anirudh find?
Anirudh had caught hold
of the real blood samples...
...which proved that there
were traces of cancer to be found.
This entire Mother Teresa act that PPFPL
puts up with their blood donation drives?
It's a big scam!
Welcome to Radio FM.
Do you know,
today is ‘Safe Water Day‘?
But drinking the water of
our city is an invitation to death.
You'd probably be safer
consuming rat poison!
So be safe,
be alert and think before you drink.
Oye!
Yes Sir.
What water did you use to make tea?
Tap water, Sir.
Get all your stuff here.
From now on, you're going to
make tea right in front of me, got it?
With this water, here catch!
If you use tap water next time,
I'm gonna throw you in jail!
Get that? - Sorry sir!
What filth these guys have been up to!
Talisker. 1O years Single Malt.
As per you request!
Talisker is great, but I haven't
got the answer to my question.
Riya.
Her death certificate.
What were you thinking?
That if you destroy PPFPL,
Riya's soul would rest in peace?
Huh?
Revenge...
ls that what it is?
Not just the water,
even the blood here is owned by PPFPL.
This city is alive only on paper.
In reality, everyone's
e><piry date has already passed.
Fountain Lab.
Mr Paddy is its biggest funder.
Even their DNA samples
are made to order.
And that's why you
got Riya's hair sampled?
<i>Dawn?</i>
You want PIVIO? Huh?
Tulsi Ram Hospital Bikaner,
you'll get a confessional statement
from Bhagat Singh's widowed wife.
Thank you
Why do you want to
needlessly become a martyr?
Bhagat Singh committed suicide.
I'm sorry.
Why sorry?
About PPFPL...
Bhagat did it.
He did it for my treatment.
For him.
I'm ready to give a statement.
I got a letter.
The stranger who wrote it
knew everything about Bhagat.
His problems, his helplessness.
That he was buried in debt.
Everything!
I don't know how that
stranger knew about all this.
All I knew is that.
..money was to come into our account.
It was a small price to
pay to secure our child's future.
He paid it, my Bhagat.
Can I ask for something
in exchange for this?
Yes.
Kindly take the return journey via train.
Train number 54701.
Q Kay-
Give me the file?
Get the car.
Yes Sir.
Uncle, don't smoke.
I have cancer. You'll get it too!
Tikoo, how many times have
I told you not to go alone'?
Wait, slowly...
He has bone cancer,
so his grip is weak...
Which side do you belong to?
As in?
I mean, are you a patient
or an insurance agent?
It's the cancer train, so I asked.
Your hair looks fine!
So I guess there's no chemo involved.
Are you done, son?
Go back to Bhatinda by train.
Train number 54701.
Blood, blood, blood!
A positive, B positive...
blood, blood!
Today's rate is 150 per packet!
Yes! Buy two and get one free!
Blood, blood, blood, blood!
Yes, anyone? Blood, blood!
A Positive, B Positive, O Positive,
A Negative, B Negative!
Chemo! First stage, Second stage!
Buy two and get one free!
- Chemo, Chemo Chemo, Chemo!
Chemo package insurance,
Chemo insurance, Chemo insurance!
Yes Uncle! Chemotherapy,
Chemo, chemo, chemo...
Look you know you are at the third
stage, there is no chance of survival.
So might as well secure
your family's future?
As soon as the last rites are done,
the money gets credited into the account.
My cut is 25 percent.
Come on, get it signed.
What stage are you at?
Chemo, Chemo Chemo!
First stage, Second stage!
<i>The region that we are in today
is now the cancer belt of our country!</i>
<i>Every home has a cancer patient now.</i>
<i>AH the high-rises in this city have
their foundations deep below in heH.</i>
<i>Ahirudh had caught hold
of the real blood samples.</i>
<i>There were traces
of cancer to be found.</i>
<i>This city is alive only on paper.</i>
<i>In reality,
everyone's expiry date has passed.</i>
The planning was the easiest bit.
Because the combat was with one's own.
A year of planning
and 3O seconds of combat.
Only the right pest
can destroy the Paddy.
I saw him on the cancer
train the first time.
That resourceful panther,
Sunday Singh.
Used to fake blood reports at PPFPL.
The most noble sacrifice in the world!
Blood donation!
Blood donation!
Blood donation!
Your very own blood donation drive!
Expert at forging
fake certificates- Ricky.
And..
The insider- Bhagat Singh.
I was aware of every
vein that ran through PPFPL.
The money would reach them, and
the messages would reach Bhagat Singh.
I had expertise in coding hence
all the messages were coded.
Each of them had their
own circumstances and dreams.
Bhagat Singh's wife had cancer.
Sunday, the middleman.
He had only one goal,
to make money at any cost.
And Ricky's dream was to go to Canada.
He also had cancer.
After the blast, I sent all three of them away
In all this ,even today Bhagat
Singh was the one who got martyred.
Terrorists only kill
a few thousands of people.
These people are destroying the lives
of generations with their poison.
The problem is of chemical contamination.
That is the potential cause of cancer.
Shaheed Bhagat Singh had said,
""For the deaf to hear,
blasts are needed"".
That's what I did,..
..did such an explosion that their
eardrums were shattered.
That day with my daughter, I died too.
I just...
wanted to destroy them
before I got reduced to ashes.
Do you think being good is a scam?
Whether you call it the system,
a scam or life itself...
That's what it is.
The fingers that pull my
trigger run strictly on orders.
I'm no superman,
who can override the system.
But I'm not so weak either
to get crushed under it.
Had studied it in Physics
Balance defines equilibrium.
That's exactly what I'm doing Sir.
Balancing.
You're thinking the right thing.
So...
What beckons me?
Asylum or custody?

My days are numbered, Papa.
This wasn't in your
target plan, right?
No, I forgot your target was for
me to run 200 meters in 2.5 mins.
300 meters in 5 mins.
Jogging...
Daily showers in cold water.
Air-force. Pilot.
I knew it...
That's why..
I tried to be a son
rather than a daughter.
As good as I could...
But you know this
being good is a scam.
It's all a scam.
It's all a scam. Bloody scam.
The sound of this running brook
that we are hearing right now...
I'll never be able to hear it again.
I won't be able to feel the wind.
I won't ever be...
able to see the mountains.
This...
I want to live.
I want to live.
l-low does it feel to breathe'?
L-low does it feel to
have a man around you'?
I failed you, sweetheart.
I failed as a father.
Goodnight Ria.
Today the report of an fire
accident has come in from Mensa Road.
The Police has not given any official
statement confirming the nature of death.
Whether it was suicide or murder.
But Parabjeet Wa|ia's
charred corpse has been found.
Sir please sir, we need to go in!
Sir please sir, we need to go in!
Sir please!
Why are you pushing?
Jai Hind sir
Sir please!
Sir please!
Sir please!
Sir please!
Sir one question please!
Sir.
Nobody will go beyond this point.
Block this area.
Keep everybody inform ed.
Sir is also here.
Can you hear this voice?
Listen closely.
This voice.
It follows me day and night.
Doesn't let me sleep,
always keeps ringing in my ears
From my ears to my breath.
From the breath to my veins.
From the veins to
my entire bloodstream.
Hello. Hello.
Hello?
Beauty care.
Sorry, I've come at the wrong time,
but Jeetu tried to threaten me again.
Wow.
Ammonium nitrate, selenium,
chromium, uranium, arsenic.
Everything is in the
ground water.
The reactor has DCIVI and Methanol...
But it only becomes poisonous
when the quantity is large.
And only Jeetu can solve this puzzle.
Because he has all
the confidential reports.
Aah. That was good.
That was good.
What is this? ls this even safe?
Safe?
That is the purest form of water.
<i>Vodka and water.</i>
There is no better cocktail on earth.
I thought its a cocktail of chemicals.
This town is a rainforest of venom,
where all the snakes
have their hoods raised.
Who is biting whom, no one knows.
And you know the official
term for this chemical chutzpah
is cocktail of chemicals.
Cocktail of chemicals.
Abdul, please drop Madam
to the Ajit Bibi road police station.
Police station... But
why police station?
What would Jeetu like?
Cheese popcorn or butter popcorn?
I think butter popcorn.
What?
He seems the butter popcorn type.
Would you like some popcorn?
Without popcorn one can't enjoy a film.
What are you doing here?
To make a case we require a dead body.
I thought we might use your corpse.
What have I done?
Attempt to murder.
Maya Singh has filed
an FIR against your name.
And this is Anirudh's post
mortem report. The authentic one.
You killed everyone, but made
a slight mistake. You left Maya alive.
That was a blunder on your part.
What do you want?
I want the secret recipe
of Paddy's chemical kitchen.
The reactor's chemical formula.
Huh?
I'll take your leave now.
Yes, Jeetu?
Boss, that bloody clog followed
me to Gazala, the cinema!
Who? Arjun Ivlishra?
Boss, he has all the evidence.
He knows it all.
He even has Anirudh's
real post mortem report.
He said my name is
attached to all the crimes.
But you assured me that he
works under the Chief Minister.
But he is an entirely different beast.
He was asking about the reactor.
Did you blurt anything out?
No no. But he will
soon visit my house.
Please do something soon, boss.
I can't manage the
situation any longer.
Don't get stressed.
Go home and relax.
I'll look into the matter.
Okay. Okay Boss.
3 lines of cocaine,
but he hadn't sniffed even one.
The residue of the coke
is on the left nostril,
whereas he is right handed.
Shoulcfve been on the right.
If you look carefully,
there are marks on the neck.
They're definitely not birthmarks.
It's murder.
You use Davidoff?
No Sir, Lacoste.
<i>Those who Watch While others burn,</i>
<i>Your straw houses will soon be graves</i>
<i>When winds stoke the ﬂames of death</i>
<i>How long will you be saved?</i>
Only Jeetu can give us
the answers to these questions.
He has all the confidential reports!
Like Grandma's recipe, eh?
They will take the
secret to their graves.
<i>I kept silent when they came for him,</i>
<i>And thus the next turn was mine,</i>
It's an open and shut case.
Just wrap it up and get
rid of it, without a sound.
<i>As you stay mum while they murder me,</i>
<i>You're going to be the next in line.</i>
Come on in.
Lord Shiva's picture?
<i>Jai Bhoienath!</i>
In your honour, we've made
Smoked Potato Mash today.
Potatoes go along with
pretty much any dish.
But no one orders it
at fancy 5 star hotels.
Why?
Because the potato
is a poor little thing.
A hero along with everything,
but on its own, a zero.
Why did Parabjit visit your house?
You have a good life, a nice family
and kids- why are you messing around?
Ma'am I was just going to arrest him,
actually.
All you guys with cushy salaried jobs,
you turn into dogs.
Puppies.
Going around sniffing pointlessly.
A life of luxury awaits
you at the IBM's office,
and here you are rolling
about in this muck.
Paddy is our fundraiser.
DCIVI, Reverse boring...
these things are like balls of wool.
The more you try to unspool,
the more you get entangled.
Pass the potato!
You don't want to
become a potato, do you?
If you're with us,
you'll remain a hero.
Nothing here moves
without my permission.
There's a press conference next week.
Parabjifs already committed suicide.
Just prove that he was mentally unstable.
I want the brief on my
table as soon as possible.
Or what's gonna happen,
Mr Arjun Mishra...
ls that you'll be transferred
to a Na><a|ite area.
Soon enough, your smiling face
will be in a frame like this,
ready to be garlanded and hung
on your wall in your loving memory.
You're a sensible guy.
Care for some dessert?
No thanks, ma'am.
Have some.
Get used to the perks
of the Phil's office... Eh?
By the way,
you can keep the gift there.
Yes.
What are you staring me for now serve?
How's it going, buddy?
Have you booked your tickets to Patna?
Katrina, Priyanka, Deepika bomb...
I've bought all the crackers!
We'll burst them together!
Listen bud, go for it
and burst them all by yourself.
So you're not coming
this time as well?
<i>It's time for me to become
your favorite Singham.</i>
Really'? Yay! Bash 'em all up together!
Yes Sir.
Good job!
Thank you, Sir!
All set?
Yeah, I think.
Davidoff? Coolvvater. Nice!
Sharp! Like a police dog.
Well, sometimes I bite too!
Madam, technology is
an amazing thing, isn't it?
You never know when it sneaks
up on you and bites you in the ass.
Have a look!
Lord Shiva's third
eye... it sees everything!
What do you want?
If you asked me 1O days back,
I might have asked for a good price.
For now, just read this.
Thank you!
<i>Resign now and save your ass.</i>
<i>l ‘m sure you can handle the rest.
After all, you're</i> a <i>politician.</i>
With a heavy heart,
I'd like to put in
my resignation today.
These tears are for my father,
who gave up his life for the people.
These tears are for the sacrifices
that I have made, for all of you.
Power and money flow like a stream,
from the top, right to the bottom.
Not from the middle, Mr Paddy!
The government belongs to its people.
We're here to serve their interests,
not your greed!
You think you own the state?
Spreading your filth everywhere?
So many revolutions have
sprung from this rich land of ours,
and you want to drain
it with your reverse boring?
I owe everything
to the people of this state!
I'm not going to let
a cancer train run over them!
I had promised you that the
investigation will be done.
I'm really shocked
to tell you that the factory
blasts were done by Bhagat Singh
and his comrades Vicky
Bhullar and Sunday Singh,
whose lives were ruined
because of your factory!
They took revenge!
My heart bleeds to think that all of
this happened right in front of my eyes!
I'd be insulting my father's legacy,
if I don't bring in a revolution!
If I let all these
sacrifices won't go in vain!
That's why I'm resigning.
But I'm not going anywhere.
I'm going to stay here
and serve the people!
She's talking rubbish!
Utter lies!
Madam what's the reason
for your resignation?
Madam do you feel this Reverse Boring scandal
will usher in a new era in politics?
Sir,Sir,Sir, Please. ..
Sir Reverse Boring
is a criminal offence,
Sir you will have to compensate the people.
Yes absolutely...
Ground water is banned
because of your factories!
Industrial contamination has been
regarded as criminal offence
It's rubbish?
Madam said it and you believed it?
Do you have any evidence?
Evidence?
It's right behind you.
Hello...
Hello, Paddy Sir?
The factory waste that we
were pumping into the ground...
The chemical level was pretty high.
It's gotten leaked into
the municipal pipeline.
Stop all this! ls this a circus?
You know who you are talking to?
I own the state!
The CM, she runs on my orders.
Do all your protests outside!
It won't even take me 2 minutes to
make you disappear into thin air! Got it?
Eh, don't touch me!
Take him away!
You're screwed, Arjun Ivlishra!
Trying to threaten me, the rascal.
<i>What are you looking at?
Didn't you watch Singham?</i>
No, but now I must.
(Protests) DOWN WITH PPFPL!
PPFPL is in the midst of controversy.
The pumpimg of chemicals into
the ground due to Reverse Boring
has spread cancer throughout the city.
PPFPL will have to pay a fine to the
tune of 15000 crores corporate debt.
PPFPL hasn't just claimed victims,
but has affected entire
families across the state.
All their offices are
being seized and sealed.
As the controversy rages on,..
PPFPL has been revealed to
be a chemical mafia organization.
(Protests) Paddy F Sharma,
drown in hell!
(Protests) Paddy F Sharma,
drown in hell!
(Protests) Paddy F Sharma,
drown in hell!
(Protests) Paddy F Sharma,
drown in hell!
Cheers!
Thanks for skipping the post-modem.
Welcome.
Whose body was it, by the way?
L-low does it matter, Sir'?
So, did you get to the PIVIO?
It's funny.
I've been promoted so many times.
But I've never felt
like my son is proud of me.
Now for the first time, I've been
demoted, and he thinks I'm a hero.
So, Naxals...
Yes Na><a|..
So what name have you thought of,
for your passport?
John F Kennedy,
John Lennon,
John Abraham...
No? No Johns?
Che Guevara.
Suits you well!
Birds of a feather...
Good.
Cheers!

Ashok and Kumar are best friends. Shanaya and Mishti are their love interests. Ashok's father is a billionaire but has been in a coma for the last six years. During these years, Ashok's maternal uncle, Kunwar Amar Nath Singh (KANS Mama) has been in charge of his family property. Having enjoyed the money, Mamaji does not want to give up that money to Ashok, who is now old enough to take over. So the evil Mamaji teams up with an evil doctor and chemist, Dr. Khan, to get rid of Ashok (without murder) and keep control of his property. Dr. Khan gives Mamaji a medicine called MAD (Mind Altering Drug) which makes one act and speak like a dog for 36 hours. At first, Mamaji is reluctant and angry at Dr. Khan. But Mamaji then sees the medicine work on Dr. Khan’s 2 assistants and agrees.

Towards this end, during a board meeting, Mamaji mixes the medicine in Ashok and Kumar's drinks, and they both start behaving like dogs. The men-behaving-like dogs are taken to a mental asylum for treatment. In the asylum, the lady doctor, Dr. Shivani, soon realizes the truth and promises to discharge them. But fate takes an even stranger twist because, in the same asylum, there are two identical lookalikes of Ashok and Kumar who are being treated in the 'B' ward. The lookalikes worked at an Indian food stall which was a front for Bijlani, a cocaine smuggler. One day Bijlani delivered a jar of cocaine to Ashok and Kumar mistaking that for flour used it for preparing parathas thereby making the customers go crazy. As a punishment, Bijlani gave them both severe electricity shocks thereby both losing their mental balance and were admitted to the asylum. These lookalikes are accidentally released instead of the real Ashok and Kumar. Shanaya and Mishti, who come to pick up their boyfriends from the asylum, take away the duplicates instead, without realizing anything. All of them go to Ashok's mansion. Here, Mamaji understands the whole mix-up and plans to use the duplicate Ashok to become the owner of the whole business empire.

By now, the true Ashok and Kumar also come to know of Mamaji's evil plan, but they are still stuck in the asylum. They are offered help by one of the ward boys, Cyrus, who takes them to a secret ward 'C' to meet 'Johnny' who is (by another coincidence or twist of fate) a look-alike of Mamaji. Johnny has a strange, dangerous habit of attacking people who sneeze in front of him. Ashok and Kumar plan revenge against Mamaji with the help of his lookalike, Johnny. However, they get caught by the asylum's sadistic warden, Y.M. Raj (a supposedly funny play on ""Yamraj,"" the god of death) before they can escape from the asylum. Y. M. Raj prepares to punish them, but he accidentally sneezes in front of them. Angered by this, Johnny beats him black and blue, thus helping the three escape.

On the day of the board meeting, the true Ashok and Kumar get ready to expose Mamaji, when Dr. Khan triggers the fire alarm. All the three mental patients escape the building. Now desperate, Ashok and Kumar bump into a dance bar owner named Balbir, who (by another coincidence) is a lookalike of Mamaji. Mamaji now does something innovative: he arranges another set of Ashok and Kumar with the help of plastic surgery from Dr. Khan's two assistants who assume their identities. He takes the triplicate Ashok and Kumar to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, where the fake (triplicate?) Ashok is to hand over all the business to him (Mamaji) in the presence of Prince Charles. However, the real Ashok and Kumar arrive, along with Balbir (who is Mamaji-III). To add to the confusion, the three mental patients also storm in to help the real Ashok and Kumar, creating panic among the eyewitnesses on seeing so many lookalikes together.

The film closes with Ashok's father coming out of his coma and recognizing the true Ashok and getting Mamaji arrested for his deeds.",3903,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt3036740.srt","He's the worst stand-up comedian.

Yes, of course, Mr. Singh.
You don't worry.
You can reIy on our discretion.

That's Ward-B of our mentaI faciIity.
MentaI patient's jaiI.

You see, Ward-A is a mentaI hospitaI.

The UKgovernment sent..

Oh, I see.
AjaiI forthe insane. - ExactIy.
But what do we care?
They don't know what happens in Ward-A.
And we don't know what
happens in Ward-B.
But we do know one thing.
Their jaiIor is just

Anyway, I'II take your

Thank you, doctor.
Thank you. - Bye..
You said the effects of your drug

Sir, what just happened inside?
And who are these two?
You're new here. So you

They are Ward-B's most
adorabIe patients.
This is Ashok, and that's Kumar.
Even if they wouId have
haIf a brain each..
..they wouId stiII end up
having onIy haIf a brain.
But what happened to them
watching eIectricity?
These two were smaII-time thieves.
They used to make Paratha
(stuffed bread)..
..South HaII Don Karan T
BijIani's 'Paratha' staII.
BijIani sir, why did
you get more fIour?
We aIready have more than enough.
This isn't fIour, its cocaine. Cocaine.
Cocaine in a fIour jar?
Don't irritate me. This
is a 'Paratha' staII.
If I keep this cocaine
in the fIour jar..
..everyone wiII think it's fIour.
These days the narcotics department
are on a high-aIert.
Keep it carefuIIy.
I've taken fuII advance from the party.
Don't worry, boss.
Your job..wiII be done.
Why are you winking?
Don't worry, boss.
As you sow.. so shaII you reap.
You winked again. Don't
make it so obvious.
Go inside.
HeIIo and weIcome to 'Kaun
Banega MiIIionaire'.
I am your host and friend Shanaya.
One common man that I

Are you a miIIionaire?
No way. I am a student.
WouId you Iike to be a miIIionaire?
Of course, who wouIdn't?
Perfect. So you're seIected
on 'Kaun Banega MiIIionaire'.
Kumar, you're watching that
rubbish TV show again.
Quiet!
Don't you dare caII this show rubbish.
I'm a big fan of this girI.
Just watch. Some day this
girI wiII choose us..
..and make us a miIIionaire.
Stop dreaming. Customers are waiting.
If you don't start making
'Parathas' soon..
..then we'II certainIy

Where's the fIour?
There's no fIour.
Where's the fIour? FIour! FIour!
FIour!
That day the customers
ate 'Cocaine parathas'.
Potato paratha, CauIifIower
paratha, Radish paratha..
..and with aII that they got coke free.
Wow, your 'parathas' are

It's not me, it's this
miracuIous fIour.
The fIourwas over.
So I used the fIour kept
beIow in this jar.
What happened? - What have you done?
Why? - That wasn't fIour.
Then? - That was BijIani's cocaine.
You made cocaine parathas.
Look. Look.
BijIani gave them eIectric shocks..
..and it compIeteIy ruined the
chemicaI baIance in their brain.
Their mentaI age started reducing..
..and became Iike chiIdren.
Oh, God!
Shocks. We're getting shocks.
Wheneverthey see eIectric
current, they get fits.
You can say that, they
had the body of a man..
..but the brain of a kid.
Poor guys.
Good morning.
No, it's good afternoon.
It's Iunchtime. 12 o'cIock.
Our cIocks stopped tikking Iong back.

Why do you aIways take such

If you Iove herthen why

Car..in my area?
Excuse me.
Why are Ashok and Kumar's posters
being put up everywhere?
Because these two dogs
fIed from this asyIum.
FIed?
You mean they haven't been discharged.
I wouId never reIease them.
But who are you?
They were admitted in this
asyIum after my diagnosis.
I am Dr. Khan.
Doctor?
You Iook more Iike a

ReaIIy?
If you teII me where they are hiding..

Wait. Wait.

Must be some spice which they added.
My head's spinning too.
Let's go sIeep.

Abracadabra..hocus-pocus.
They are compIeteIy mad.
It worked the Iast time.
There were no utensiIs
on the tabIe Iast time.
HeIIo. - Khan.
Did you find out how Ashok and Kumar..
..were reIeased from the mentaI asyIum?
ActuaIIy, they weren't reIeased..
..they had escaped.
But Iast night, I brought
them back to the asyIum..
..with the heIp of the warden.
Then teII me something you rascaI.
What are those two doing
in garden right now?
What?
I mean they are right here.
But how's that possibIe?
They are right before my eyes
in the asyIum's B-wing.
What nonsense.
HonestIy.
Come and see for yourseIf.
What?
What are you bIabbering?
Those two are here?
Do you know what they've
done to me at home?
They buttered my face.
What..
UncIe!
Ashok.
Thank God you're here.
What's happening with us?
Why are we in a mentaI asyIum?
And..we were reIeased.
So why are we being kept here?
Ashok. Kumar. I am so
sorry about aII this.
This..is certainIy the doing
of our rivaI companies.
But you two don't worry.
I wiII do my best to get
you two out of here.
And when I find out who
drugged your gIasses..
..during the board meeting,
I won't spare him.
I wiII get you two out of
here at any cost, okay.
I'II be back.
UncIe.
How did you know our
gIasses were drugged?
Son..the doctortoId me.
How couId I not see this coming?
You're behind aII this.
No, no, Ashok. Of course not.
Dad's in coma.
I am in jaiI.
So who wiII run the company?
You!
And the company's cIause states that..
..if you Iose your mentaI
baIance, then..
You'II be given the temporary
power of attorney.
And soon..it wiII be permanent.
Caught me! Caught me! Caught me!
FinaIIy you two saw my true coIors.
But..Iook at the irony of Iife.
I am the one that's caught red-handed..
..and you two are behind bars.
Yes, I dosed you with that drug.
And that drug was prepared by Dr. Khan.
He's a big rascaI..
..Kunwar Amar Nath Singh.
KANS. (mythoIogicaI viIIain)
So how can you expect
any goodness from him?
In the next board meeting..
..I'II be the new boss of Singhania
Group of Industries.
And you..wiII officiaIIy handover
the entire property to me.
Now you'II ask how.
We have your Iook-aIikes.
And right now..
..they are at your house.
And it's no rocket science
to understand..
..that they are the
reaI mentaI patients.
And you're being heId
here in their pIace.
You know what I mean.
Two DoubIe roIes.
And coincidentIy, do you
know what their names are?
Ashok..and Kumar!
Now..I'm going to use
those stupid doubIes..
..and seize the entire property.
And yes..after Iast night's
'great escape'..
..there's no chance of escaping again.
Because aII the security
Iocks have been changed.
Now you two wiII rot here.
See you guys Iike..
Never!
I've seen and heard everything.
What are you doing?
I want to show you two something.
Come with me
Consider me a friend. Come on.
Come.
There aren't just two Iook-aIikes here.
There are three.
This is the most dangerous..
..and insane patient
of this institution.
That's why he's been
kept in secret ward C.
Johnny!
When I saw your uncIe, I couIdn't
beIieve my eyes either.
Just Iike you two can't beIieve it.
Get ready KANS.
If you have our Iook-aIikes ..
..then we've your Iook-aIike.
The reaI fun begins.
Ashok. Kumar.
Cyrus has toId me everything..
..that happened with you.
Somehow I feeI very guiIty.
Confused by your Iook-aIikes..
..I reIeased the other Ashok and Kumar.
Now that you know everything..
..I'm sure you understand that..
..how important Johnny's for us.
Doctor, if we train Johnny
to act Iike my uncIe..
..then wiII you heIp
us get out of here?
Of course.
I am with you. - Thank you.
HoId on.
No one can heIp anyone here.
I admit that I took you to see Johnny..
..but I don't think he's
of any use to you.
Why? - He's got 3rd stage OCD
What? 3rd stage OCD? - Yes, doctor.
3rd stage? OCD?
What's that?
OCD. Obsessive CompuIsive Disorder.
An iIIness to stay cIean.
They are scared of germs. Wear gIoves.
Yes, but that's stage one.
Stage two patients are
a threat to themseIves.
Like..they'II rub soap so hard..
..that they'II bIeed themseIves.
But stage three.
Stage three cases are very rare.
AImost one in a miIIion.
Their condition is so worse..
..that if someone sneezes, they feeI..
..he's trying to kiII them
by spreading germs.
They attack to kiII.
What?
And Johnny has aIready attacked
seventeen peopIe.
What nonsense.
If someone sneezes Johnny
wiII kiII him?
Yes. - Yes.
And anyway, how can you use someone..
..who attacks even if someone sneezes?
SimpIe.
We won't sneeze.
PIease don't sneeze.
Don't sneeze.
Don't sneeze.
Don't..
Why wiII I sneeze?
PIease, Ieave it to us.
Hi, Johnny.
I am Ashok, this is Kumar.
Hi.
We're from Ward-B.
ActuaIIy, our Iook-aIikes
are in Ward-B.
ActuaIIy, they aren't in Ward-B either.
They are at hour home.
And we're stuck in their pIace instead.
And the one that got us in here..
..has a Iook-aIike too.
Do you know who?
You!
Now we've two choices.
Eitherwe spend the rest
of our Iives here..
..and turn crazy ourseIves.
Orwe take revenge from the man..
..that got us in here.
And if we chose the second option..
..then we'II need your heIp.
And if you heIp us, Johnny..
..then I promise to get you treated..
..by the best doctors in the worId.
I'II take you some pIace..
..where you're treated
Iike a human being
A pIace..which is absoIuteIy cIean.
Where there's no dirt.
No germs.
Where no one wiII ever sneeze.
I hate germs.
I hate germs.
Johnny..

It's not opening, it's jammed.
Open the door.
He's gone berserk. Open it quickIy.

You can hide in the trunk of my car.
I wiII first cIean the trunk.
Come on. Let's go.
Perfect.
Everything wiII be fine now.
Perfect?
You caII this perfect.
Two days Iaterthat uncIe of yours..
..wiII use your Iook-aIike in
your Mauritius Beach Resort..
..in front of your Board Members..
..and strip you of yourfortune.
You wiII be ruined in two days.
You wiII Iose everything.
And you caII it perfect.
Mishit, is your information correct?
Yes, sir.
I overheard your uncIe discuss
the entire pIan..
..overthe phone with Dr. Khan.
Dinner Party on Friday.
Get-together on Saturday.
And aII important conferences
on Sunday.
That's why I caIIed it perfect.
We won't get a better chance.
The three of them wiII be
together at the same pIace.
And with the board members.
We'II go there..
..and exchange pIaces with our
Iook-aIikes at the right moment.
And then Ashok, Kumar and Kans
wiII attend the conference.
And Johnny, as we discussed.
In the meeting you'II teII the board
members that I am absoIuteIy fine.
And the entire property shouId
be returned to me. Okay?
What about those three then?
Back to the mentaI asyIum..
..where you wiII treat Ashok and Kumar.
And what about Kans.
He'II rot in Ward-C forever.
Good pIan. Done?
Done. - Done.
Done. - Not done.
Why? - If anyone sees you
with your Iook-aIike..
..then it'II be hard to recognize
which is the reaI one.
Fine, then we'II go there in disguise.
Done?
Done.
Done. - Done.
Not done. - What now?
Because aII the bookings are strictIy
done for company empIoyees..
..and board members.
Each person is accounted for.
So..you can't go there
in disguise either.
Sir, there's one way.
I had a word with the
resort managertoday.
And they are hiring waitresses.
If you don't mind..
So?
You can go there disguised
as waitresses.
What?
By the way, it's not a bad option.
You three wiII Iook reaIIy cute..
..in a waitress outfit.
It's not funny, doctor.
There's no otherway, guys.
This is your onIy chance
to take revenge on Kans.
Don't Iet it sIip.
So done?
Done.

Here, we're dressed as girIs.
What next?
Now go and fIirt with those three.
And renderthem unconscious
with chIoroform.
Wow. Is it so simpIe?
Why wouId anyone fIirt with us?
Because of this.
Pheromones.
What are pheromones?
Haven't you seen that ad where..
..the boy sprays a perfume on himseIf
and aII the girIs go crazy?
It's something Iike that..for boys.
Oh my, God.
You're a ceIebrity, aren't you?
I know you. You're Kumar.
You used to make 'Parathas'
at South HaII.
I used to, but now I am a miIIionaire.
MiIIionaire.
You aren't my husband.
What do you mean? -
Means..I'm a big fan.
Every time I ate your Paratha..
..it made me feeI Iike I
had grown 'Par' (wings).
PIease, can I have one
autograph and one pic?
No autograph. I am hungry.
I'II go have the buffet.
- Where are you going?
I mean..the buffet's that way.
Where?
Where?
This way. See.
Baby doII. You're absoIuteIy right.
The buffet's right here.
Someone might see us here.
This isn't right.
I can't do any better in this pIace.
When do you want it? - What?
Autograph.
Oh! I was scared.
Listen.
My pen and paper is in the cabin.
Come to my cabin.
'Good deeds need no invitation.'
But no smooch here.
Come on. - Let's go.
Come on. - Let's go.
Come on. - Let's go.
Oh my, God. I am so sorry.
I am so sorry, I ruined your shirt.
Then cIean it.
Not here, come with
me..to the washroom.
I'II cIean it up.
Your perfume's reaIIy nice.
It's awakening the animaI in me.
I bought it at the duty-free.
Enough about duty-free..
..when is this beauty going to be free?
In a whiIe.
Then make me another drink.
This is the IocaI stuff.
I've got the internationaI
stuff with me.
At the back, in the corner.
Then Iet's go in the corner.
By the way, what name shouId I write?
My name is Sona.
GoId in EngIish, or sIeep.
SIeep! That's what I want, baby.
What are you doing? I am scared.
What's happened, baby? What's happened?
Rich peopIe Iike you
come here for a break.
And break our hearts instead.
I am not that type of a guy.
Even I am not that type of a guy.
I mean I am not that type of a girI.
Then what type of a girI
are you.. Chandi (SiIver).
Virgin.
Damnit!
Virgin AirIines, siIIy.
I was the airhostess.
But they fired me.
Why did they fire my sweetheart?
One day my ex-boyfriend..
Ex-boyfriend.
Met me on the fIight.
So I yeIIed aIoud.
Hi Jack.
You just hijacked me.
Looking at you I feeI.. if someone
Iike you comes in my Iife.
Then you'II be fIoored.
No, he'II be the father of my kid.
You've a kid, Heera?
No, no.
No one's turned this
bud into a fIower yet.
You're more Iike a cauIifIower.
'Gobi Ka PhooI!' (CauIifIower)
No.. I am a mistake.
I was born in a Iaundry.
Then I'II have to dry-cIean your youth.
By the way what are your vitaI stats?
96-84-96.
Wow..what numbers.
I am big fan of these numbers.
You're sweating so much.
Let me wipe it.
'Oh my, God! The chIoroform
isn't working.'
Don't fear, come near.
Put my passion in third top gear.
Sir, sir, pIease not today. - Why?
Today's my 'Brath' (fast).
- What 'Brath'?
Bad 'Brath'. (Bad breath)!
SmeII it. SmeII it.
SmeII it.
What's this way of making
me smeII your perfume?
This is my favorite
perfume. - Which one?

Then make me smeII it.
SmeII it. SmeII it.

He's Iike famiIy.

..they suffered strange fits.
They were sent to the mentaI asyIum.
They had to undergo treatment.
The doctors say that..

in their condition.
In fact, the improvement's so good..
..that they can run
the companies again.
What?
I wouId Iike to request you aII..
..to return the temporary
power of attorney..
..vested with me back to Ashok.

afterthat fat girI.
Yes.
But you say what you've been taught.
AII those in favor pIease

No, no, no, no.
Give it to him.
Stop it. - Come on.
Why you.. - Enough! Enough!

You're Johnny from Ward-C.
We got you out of jaiI.
We trained you.
We were going to make your Iife better.
And you were uttering

Do something. - ReIax,

Members of the board.
AII the confusion is
now compIeteIy cured.
The man who's been dreaming..

..wants to say something to aII of you.
Come, uncIe.
WiII you teII the truth.. or do I?
Come on, uncIe, everyone's waiting.
ActuaIIy..
No, you take it.
What's going on?

Everyone get out.
He escaped.
ReIax, Kuwar. - What reIax?

And I wonderwhere our crazy Ashok

Your PIan A and PIan
B faiIed miserabIy.
You're teIIing me to reIax.
Look, PIan A and PIan B faiIed..
..but PIan C won't.
What PIan C?
Ashok. Kumar.
Oh, these two fooIs were
hiding at your pIace.
Hi, uncIe.
You've put on weight again.
Let's go take..steam, sauna.
First we'II take steam..

Why are they taIking Iike Chinku-Pinku?
Because they aren't your

In fact, they are my assistants
Chinku-Pinku.
Yes.

How is that even possibIe?
When you were training those

moIecuIar structure.
So that I couId perform

PIastic surgery?
Oh my, God.
Oh my, God.

You're a genius.
And..us?

ReaIIy?
We're reaIIy going through a bad phase.
UncIe Kans knows we've his Iook-aIike.

Yes, aunt.
That's my BaIbir.
Do you know BaIbir?
No, aunt. You're mistaken.

No. - No.
Your Majesty, they are Iying.

Are you caIIing us crazy?
- Yes, you're crazy.
They are the crazy ones.
- Oh my God, confession.
They're admitting they are crazy.
We aren't mad. - We're just crazy.

This is more confusing

Who's reaI? Who's fake?
We're reaI.
We're reaI.

One of them is reaI.
Security! Security! Take them away.

We're just crazy. -
Don't worry, darIing.
I'II fix that. - Wow!
Show-offs!
There's a big difference..
..between their 'wapa-chiki' and ours.
The most interesting thing is..
..we had so much action,
but no one sneezed.
No!
I am just joking.
TiII now I had just one son.
But now I have four sons.
And yes, two daughter as weII.
Wow.

Avinash ""Tiger"" Singh Rathore, an Indian intelligence officer working for the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), is tasked with eliminating Rabinder, a fellow agent who has defected to Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), during a mission in Iraq. Disillusioned by the constant violence of his work, Tiger expresses a desire for a less combative assignment. His superior, Shenoy, subsequently sends him to Dublin to observe Anwar Jamal Kidwai, an Indian scientist suspected of sharing sensitive missile technology.

Posing as Manish Chandra, a writer researching Indian academics abroad, Tiger travels to Ireland with his handler Gopi. He attempts to gain access to Kidwai by befriending Zoya Nazar Jung, the scientist's part-time caretaker and a dance student at Trinity College. Tiger and Zoya develop a rapport that evolves into a romantic relationship. She invites him to a college production of My Son, Pinocchio, which she has choreographed. Around the same time, Tiger is attacked by an unknown assailant, raising suspicions that his cover has been compromised.

On the day of the play, Tiger spots the attacker and chases him through the city, ultimately stopping a tram accident in the process. Gopi simultaneously reports suspicious activity at Kidwai's house. There, Tiger discovers that Zoya is in fact an ISI agent assigned to extract Kidwai’s research. Despite her refusal to defect, Tiger allows her to escape after fending off Feroz, an ISI agent revealed to be the mystery assailant.

Back in India, Tiger requests to be removed from field duty and returns to internal analysis work. He later deciphers a coded ISI message with help from his colleague Bagga, realizing it is a signal from Zoya, who is expected to attend an upcoming United Nations conference in Istanbul. The two reunite and decide to abandon their respective agencies. They travel to Astana to mislead RAW and ISI and then flee to Havana, Cuba, to begin a new life.

Their presence in Havana is discovered after they are caught on surveillance cameras during a mugging incident. Spotted again at a boxing match, Zoya is eventually arrested by local authorities and handed over to ISI agents. Tiger, in collaboration with Gopi, orchestrates a plan to rescue her. During a staged prisoner transport, Tiger and Zoya escape aboard a light aircraft, with Tiger sustaining a gunshot wound from Gopi, who allows them to flee.

In the aftermath, Tiger calls Shenoy and states that he and Zoya will only return when India and Pakistan no longer require intelligence agencies to act against one another. An epilogue reveals that the couple is rumored to have been sighted in cities around the world, including Venice, Cape Town, Zurich, and London.",2737,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt2016894.srt","The armies of India and Pakistan...
have fought four wars in
the past sixty years...
but there are two government
agencies in these two countries...
that are at war every day...
every moment...
India's RAW and Pakistan's ISI.
The common man does not get
any news about these agencies...
because in the name
of national security
all information is forever guarded.
But there are some stories that
escape these walls and office files.
This is the story that shook...
...the very foundations
of this secretive world.
This is the story of
Tiger...
Goodbye...
Tiger?
Hello... hello...
Those people are here.
I told you they would find me!
They found me!
You've kept me here for over a
month... now get me out of here!
Tell me quickly...
what should I do? Tell me... okay...
I'll get there... you get there too!
You're panting like a dog...
how much do you smoke?
I can't believe you sold
out to them, Rabinder...
How much did the ISI pay?
Tiger... how much does
the government job pay us?
What is the going price
for buying agents these days?
It's a lot, Tiger! Trust me...
there is a lot of money!
Should be... after all you
sold information to the ISI...
the guys who kill our
agents almost every day.
So? Even we smash those guys.
How many ISI men have you
killed in your career alone?
This is a game, Tiger...
we are the smallest pawns in it.
Please understand...
I'll show you...
Look at this, Tiger!
Just see... will RAW
ever give us this?
Just see this, Tiger...
This is... almost two months' salary.
What good is it, Tiger?
One fine day we'll end up dead...
in some obscure part of the world...
and no one will come
to claim our bodies.
Come with me, Tiger...
there's a lot of money to be made...
there's nothing in all these issues.
Sorry, Rabinder...
you will have to come with me...
I'm not going, Tiger!
I won't go with you...
I'm telling you, I won't.
Alive...
or dead.
He's back!
The hero returns...
He has shown up after many days.
Hey, look... He's back again...
Why are you so happy?
I'm not happy. I'm just telling you.
Look at his face...
He must have been in a brawl.
He goes missing for months...
how can you even think of getting him
married to our dear Bablee?
Why are you staring at him?
I'm not staring at him.
Do your exercise!
But what does he do?
How the hell should I know?
But he's a Grade 1 officer.
Hello, sonny... it's nine already...
...let me give you a
lift to the office.
Thank you, Mr Bagga.
Come...
I had a briefing
with Mr Shenoy at nine.
Oh... Mr Shenoy is extremely punctual.
Sir... Rabinder was kept
near Iraq's Northern border...
I had information that the
ISI might move him any time.
We caught him at the right time.
Good Job, Tiger.
Thank you, Sir...
As usual...
Submit the full report to Tiwari.
Yes, Sir.
Tiger...
- Yes, Sir?
Your face is badly bruised.
Why don't you go on
leave and rest for a bit?
Sir... I'll be fine
in a couple of days...
Why do I need to go on leave?
You've been on assignments
back to back for 12 years now.
That's way too long.
Don't tempt fate.
Sir, one fine day I'll find
myself posted to a desk job,
reading files... just like you do.
Alright...
as soon as you look normal again
you can leave for
your next assignment.
Where, Sir?
Why don't you treat me
to your famous daal...
then I'll find you an
enemy in a new country.
Done, Sir.
Sir... I often get this feeling that
you hired me at RAW
purely for my cooking skills.
You're right...
for your cooking skills...
and your insanity.
How do you live like this, Tiger?
This decade old furniture,
no pictures or books or anything?
Your salary has been lying untouched
in the agency's salary
account for the last 8 years...
why?
How can I spend when I'm never here?
I have been
traveling all over the world
for the past 12 years
on government funds.
Wow... how much have you saved?
About 2.3 million...
But your money will rot
in the agency's bank...
No, Sir... the day I retire from
this job... I'll blow it all up.
Why didn't you ever have a girlfriend?
Sir, how could I have one?
Firstly I'm never here... and
secondly this goddamn job...
What's wrong with the job?
Sir... we have no
answers when someone asks
What do you do?
I'm in the civil service...
What exactly is your job?
I'm in administration...
What is your duty?
Government duty...
- But what do you do?
Nothing as of now...
Sir... sometimes I feel
like screaming and saying...
I'm a spy... a RAW Agent!!
Spy... Secret Agent!!
I'm James Bond!!
Sir... I still have time...
what about you...
why didn't you ever get married?
When I was young...
I was a bit of a poet...
and poets don't settle for arranged
marriages... they look for love.
Did you find love, Sir?
Yes... I did... once...
Wow!
Who was she, Sir?
Well... she was this
sweet simple girl...
When I met her... I wanted
to live my life only for her.
And then?
Then... my goddamn duty got in the way
And you chose your duty over love?
Of course... isn't that
what we're trained for?
But do you ever regret it, Sir?
Every day, Tiger... every single day.
Hello... yes, Nambiar.
Right, right... thank you.
It seems we've found
you your next mission.
Cheers, Sir!
Between India and Pakistan...
only India has an
anti-missile system that
can stop incoming Pakistani
missiles to a large extent.
And one man has played a
big role in developing it...
Professor Anwar Jamaal Kidwai...
a scientist who is well
known all over the world...
but he's a maverick...
that's why he quit his government job
and started teaching at the famous
Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland.
But for the last few months
we suspect that Professor Kidwai
has been sharing his research
findings with other scientists...
who could be working for the
Pakistan defence establishment.
So I must stop him?
No, Tiger... like I said,
we only suspect him.
All you need to do is observe him.
Tiger...
Please don't kill anyone here.
Right, Sir...
Every mission of yours...
someone gets killed.
Please just observe him... okay?
Okay, Sir.
Professor Kidwai...
what an honour to meet you.
I park there every day...
it's my spot.
Sure, Sir.
Professor Kidwai...
Professor! Professor Kidwai?
No time, no time.
Pleasure meeting you
Good afternoon, Professor Kidwai!
Hello!
Professor... I have to speak
with you about something important.
Sorry, I've got to feed the dog.
After feeding doggy?
I won't take too much of your time...
Sorry!
This professor is a nutcase.
Professor... Professor...
Professor... I won't
take up too much time.
Sorry... got to take Rocket out.
Shall I wait here?
Rocket!
Rocket!
There's one girl who has
access to the professor's house...
a British girl of
Indian origin... Zoya.
A student of Trinity
Dance Academy for a year now.
And a part-time
caretaker of his house.
Get out! You really cannot be here.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Relax...
I really didn't mean to. Excuse...
Will you please leave!
You're still here?
Yes... waiting for the mad professor.
Next time ring the bell...
or I'll get you arrested.
Sorry, Miss...
Does he know you?
No... I have come from India.
It's difficult to say
when he'll be back...
This is his house, right?
Yes... but he goes for
long walks with Rocket.
Hope he hasn't gone to London.
I've just come from there...
I could have met him there.
I'm sorry... he's troubled me all day.
Very funny.
Excuse me...
I don't know anyone here...
is there a hotel around somewhere?
They're on my way... come on.
We've not been introduced as yet...
I'm Zoya... Friends call me Zee.
I'm Manish Chandra...
My friends call me Doordarshan.
What?
Zee... Doordarshan?
That was a terrible joke.
Sorry... it was seriously rotten.
Check this one.
Excuse me... do you have any rooms?
Yes I believe we do, Sir...
Thank you. Looking very lovely today.
Thank you.
No rooms.
Try here.
Good evening.
Good evening, Sir...
Can I help you?
My name is Manish Chandra.
Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.
This hotel is over-booked.
Okay... listen... my hostel is here...
but there are a couple of hotels
ahead... try them if you like.
Sure... thank you.
Not from there... come this way...
Which way?
Climb the pipe...
This pipe?
It's wet... slippery.
Wait... I'll get something for you...
Okay...
Take this.
How?
I've got a good grip.
Okay... give me 100 Euros...
A hundred Euros?
What exactly do you do?
Do you want to sleep
in that room or not?
My friend stays there, but she
is out of town... hundred Euros?
But 100 Euros is a lot...
that's more expensive than hotels.
Okay... then sleep on the bench.
Okay, okay... but...
can you take it yourself...
inside the jacket pocket.
Thanks.
- Welcome
What do you do?
Me?
I'm a writer.
What's your business
with the Professor?
I'm writing a book on
the finest Indian minds...
and Professor Kidwai
happens to be one of them.
So, you're here to
interview the professor?
If you interview me later,
that will be a huge help.
Yes... why are you
standing on that pipe?
Go ahead... good night.
What?
Can you cook?
Not bad... for an Indian man.
Are you married?
Straightaway marriage? Won't you
ask me first if I have a girlfriend?
No... I think you're old
enough to be married now.
No... I'm not married yet.
Why?
I don't get to meet nice girls.
What are you looking for, Mr. Writer?
Nothing much...
Just a sweet simple girl...
Someone who'd make me
want to live only for her.
Wow... very romantic...
but you're a bit of a
bumpkin when it comes to style.
Really? This is the first
time someone has called me that.
What? A bumpkin?
No... romantic.
And you've been
called a bumpkin before?
No... that's a first as well.
Good night Mr Writer.
- Good night, Zoya.
The 100 Euros were for
this pass... a play that
I'm going to choreograph...
Professor Kidwai sponsors it.
Your breakfast, Sir.
Excuse me... can you puncture
the yellow and make it solid?
Okay. - Thank you
What happened?
Aren't you a little
fussy when it comes to food?
Maybe a little.
So you want to spend some
time with Professor Kidwai?
Yes... so that I get
to know him better.
I'll try to speak to him...
come to his house tomorrow morning.
But I can't promise anything.
No problem.
Just the way you like it, Sir.
Thank you.
And here's the cheque.
Whenever you are ready.
I hope you don't mind if I leave
you alone with your punctured eggs.
I'm getting late for my
play rehearsal. See you later.
You pay the bill... why should I?
Yes, of course...
you keep puncturing eggs to eat them
and make the Indian
government pay for it.
Manish Chandra...
isn't that a boring name?
I wanted a boring name...
should sound like a
decent guy... right?
Look at her gorgeous hair... fire!
Okay 'decent guy', listen...
you'll have to get
close to the professor now.
I'm thinking... people
here are so honest...
they don't even bolt their doors...
I should barge into
the professor's house
and just run off with his computer.
Oh, no...
Shenoy Sir has clearly
instructed we don't need his computer
All we need to do is keep
an eye on what he does...
who he meets... who he speaks to...
The Professor is a nutcase...
I'm thinking of entering his
house with the girl's help...
she's calling me tomorrow morning.
Good plan.
Is he there?
Maybe...
Sir, I'm writing a book on
the finest Indian minds...
I'm just a mad scientist...
at least this is what the
Indian Government thinks...
No, Sir... you are being modest.
Okay... if you insist.
Tell me what will I have to do?
Sir, I want to spend the
maximum time possible with you.
It will be good for the book.
For example, when you
make your morning notes...
then I can be with you
when you leave for college...
I can be with you in your
office observing your work...
seeing your research...
We can talk in your house
when you come back home...
just observe you and be around you,
Sir... like a constant companion.
Mr Chandra, are you here to
write a book on me or to marry me?
Zoya, why does this damn Rocket
launch himself when he sees me?
Hey... don't say that...
Rocket is very sweet.
But he keeps barking at me.
That's because you swore at him.
Hey... but I said it in front of you.
Don't you like dogs?
No... I do like them.
Good.
Zoya... your hostel.
Yes... bye.
Zoya... do you want to...
like... have dinner?
Mr. Writer... are you
asking me out on a date?
Date?
No... I mean... we can have a meal...
I'm going out with my friends tonight.
Join us... I'll let you pay the bill.
Sure.
But I hope you won't
turn up like this?
Like what?
You know... dressed like a bumpkin.
Just get a little cooler...
Keep your foot behind that line.
Hey, everybody!!
Guys listen... this is my
friend Manish... he's from India.
Hey Manish, it's your turn...
Have you ever thrown darts?
Hello...
Dude... all three hit bull's-eye!
Are you a writer or James Bond?
I know... I know...
won't happen again.
This girl is
affecting you, my friend...
Don't be silly...
it's a part of my job.
Fine... and don't drink too much.
Okay... mummy dear... bye
Oh, so sweet... was that
your mother on the line?
Come on, guys... we're
going to Mike's party.
Do you wanna come?
- No, no...
Come on, ya... it will be fun...
No... you enjoy... you go.
You guys carry on...
I'll see you later.
Okay, bye! Cheers!
Bye!
Hey, but please don't
stay because of me...
Why? Now you don't
want to pay for my dinner?
No, not Ree... Dee...
Ta-ng-dee
Tang-Ree
Tang... Tang-dee...
That's what I said... Tang-ree
Do as I say... bend
your tongue upwards
and touch it to the roof of
your mouth... like this...
and now hit your front two
Bugs Bunny teeth with it... Dee!
Ree...
Dee...
- Tang-dee... - Correct!
See... right?
Now place the order...
- Okay...
Two... Tang-ree kebabs
Go ahead, my friend...
get Tang-ree kebabs...
No problem, Sir.
You know what?
You don't look like a writer.
For example...
your hands...
they are not like a writer's...
they're cut and
bruised like a wrestler's.
Why did you become a writer?
Just followed my heart.
Very few people follow
their hearts... you're lucky.
The most important
thing for an agent is...
that he should use his
head and not his heart.
The day you follow your heart,
consider yourself dead.
I admire a man who follows his heart.
Tang-dee kabab for you, Sir...
and ma'am... for you Tang-ree...
enjoy.
What the hell, Gopi...
you kept coughing...
what if she saw you...
I've reached... I'll call you back.
But Tiger... he could
have been a burglar.
No, Gopi...
the way he attacked me...
he was obviously trained.
Someone is reacting on
seeing me with the Professor.
Boss, things are not good here.
We'll have to wrap this up quickly.
That's why we're here.
How's this?
What will you do with it?
It's a gift.
And it's a gift for whom?
For Zoya... to say thank you.
Wow, Tiger!
You've used people all over
the world and discarded them
since when have you
started saying thank you?
Gopi... this is a
different sort of a mission...
here it's important to say thank you.
Which mission?
Ours? Or have you
started another mission?
Stop your nonsense and tell
me what you think of this.
Isn't this too personal?
What?
I mean... do you know her that
well that you can give her a dress?
I'm giving her a dress...
not taking it off.
Tiger... you've never bought a gift...
...for a girl ever in
your life... have you?
Never.
Then what's going on here?
What?
Hey... it's extremely important
to woo Zoya for this mission.
What?
Don't get wooed
yourself in the process.
Hi, Zoya...
Hi...
Hope you're not busy?
Lighting design for the show...
is that gift for me?
Yes.
Really? Is it really for me?
Yes... but honestly this is the
first time I've given a gift to a girl.
In these matters I'm a bit of a...
like you say... bumpkin.
That's really sweet of you...
can I open it now? - Yes.
How do you know that...
Your room had so many
things with stars and stuff?
You don't like it?
No, Manish... I really like it...
Then why are you crying?
It reminds me of someone...
Hey, Zoya, do you want to
give me the spotlight cue?
Yes, sure... just give me one second.
Okay, switch on track number 9...
I'll show you the path.
One second...
Will you help me? I can't do it alone.
But I don't know how to dance.
No one is asking you to dance.
Just hold me and follow me.
Oh... come on.
Manish...
Music is over.
What happened?
My head is spinning.
Wanderer... Wanderer
My heart's a wanderer
From the moment I saw her
My heart became a wanderer
Neither awake nor asleep
My heart's a wanderer
When she smiles
I forget everything
See... My heart has gone wayward
Wanderer... Wanderer
For her melodies
My heart became a wanderer
Wanderer... Wanderer
For her melodies
My heart became a wanderer
She breezes gently past my heart
Her words are a mystery to me
When she laughs...
colourful butterflies take flight
It's like being struck by lightning
I have surrendered my heart
Wanderer... Wanderer
For her melodies
My heart became a wanderer
Her words cast a magical spell
Her words cast a magical spell
Her eyes are an artist's delight
I've dreamt a hundred dreams about her
And still I'm restless to see her
I would give up the world for her
Wanderer... Wanderer
For her melodies
My heart became a wanderer
Wanderer... Wanderer
For her melodies
My heart became a wanderer
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
Were you just dancing?
Dancing?
Are you crazy? Who was dancing?
Forget the girl...
get Rocket. Let's go.
One damned dog has made
a kitten out of Tiger.
Bloody mouse!
Zoya... will you come
out with me tonight?
Why are you running?
- Because you're on a cycle.
What happened?
Can we meet tonight?
Tonight?
Tonight... tonight is very important.
Mr. Writer... so you are
asking me out on a date?
Yes, Zoya Zee...
When and where?
Central Park... at 11 sharp...
At 11?
11 p.m. Is very important.
Okay.
Rocket?
Hey!
Don't misbehave with elders!
Hey... if you bite me
your teeth will break.
Good boy, Rocket...
Good boy, Rocket... good boy...
Good boy, Rocket...
Hi...
Have you got Professor
Kidwai for the date as well?
I told you I'd get you to be
friends with Rocket... see...
it's done... now
he'll never bark at you.
Zoya Zee... come, I want
to show you something...
Come Rocket, come, come.
What?
How sweet... so you
called me here to see this?
Such a meteor shower happens
only once in 20-25 years...
do you know when the
last such shower was?
16th June 1991...
at 11:55...
I was 6 years old...
my father had an old Willy's jeep...
we would drive out of the city...
to see stars...
He would tell me that watching stars
makes people happy...
because all your loved ones
eventually become stars in the sky...
and bless us from up there.
As a child I used to
enjoy hearing such stories.
Zee, where is your father?
Which one?
That one...
Wow... right next to my father.
What was your father's name?
Nazar Jung...
Nazar, Sir...
What shall I hide from you...
you are seeing
everything from there...
after all, your name means sight.
Honestly... I'm a little
slow in certain matters...
I think that's why your
daughter calls me a bumpkin.
Honestly... I want to convey
something to your daughter...
but I don't know how to...
So, Mr Nazar, what should I do
according to you... any tips?
Manish...
What do you want to tell me?
Hey, caveman...
Is everything alright?
I need a drink.
What the hell are you saying?
Can't people like us fall in love?
Of course we can...
but not on a mission.
When are we not on a mission?
And do we have a life
beyond these missions or not?
Mission!
Is Zoya also?
Zoya likes that
writer Manish Chandra...
I am neither Manish...
nor am I a writer...
who am I?
I've changed so many names
that I don't even remember
what my parents named me.
What are you saying, Tiger?
Tiger... Tiger... Tiger...
Shenoy Sir called me that once...
and now everyone calls me that.
Tiger is a name meant for dogs.
I warned you... in
an attempt to woo her
don't get wooed
yourself in the process.
Say thank you now...
Should I tell you something...
You've chosen a nice
girl (sister-in-law)...
It's five in the morning...
get some sleep...
it's her play in the evening.
Sorry...
Sorry...
Excuse me?
In ten minutes you've
destroyed half of Dublin...
and that agent got away too...
what the hell are you doing, Tiger?
What else could I have
done in that situation?
And that guy would have come
to know that I'm not a writer.
Not just him... the whole town
will know you're not a writer.
Where will the Professor be right now?
Must be watching the play...
what else?
Do one thing... you go there...
...you'll stay safe
from the police as well.
I'll speak to Shenoy Sir on a
secure line and then call you.
Alright.
- Keep your phone on... - Alright.
And listen... get your face fixed.
Yes... I'll do that.
And listen... keep this.
Anything else?
Not at all... after
destroying everything...
You please go ahead and enjoy
the play with dear sister-in-law.
Yes, Gopi?
Tiger... there's some
activity at the Professor's house.
But the Professor is here.
That's what I'm saying...
you head there...
there seems to be some trouble.
- Oh, shit!
Put your hands behind your head...
turn around...
slowly.
Zoya...
But you were at the play?
What business do you
have with the Professor?
So, you're here to
interview the Professor?
What do you do?
You don't look like a writer.
Oh my God!
So you want to spend some
time with Professor Kidwai?
Agent...
ISI... right?
Get up...
Sit down.
You're an agent...
and clearly a very good one at that...
so you must be aware...
of what we do in such situations...
still... I'll tell you...
you have two options...
either you work with us...
and give us all the information...
or...
I'll have to... right here...
I will not betray my country...
So that leaves me
with just one choice...
and for you too.
My name is not Manish...
and I'm not a writer...
besides these two things...
everything I told you was true.
All I want to know from you is...
what I saw in your eyes...
was that a lie too?
I was just doing my job...
and nothing else.
Tiger... you end up killing
someone on every assignment...
we didn't want this
on this assignment.
Sir, the situation
was really bad there...
it was either me or their agent.
Police found their agent's body...
I hope you haven't left any trails?
No, Sir... and I retrieved
the hard disk as well...
I've submitted it to Joshi.
File your report as well.
Tiger...
Are you ready for
your next assignment?
Sir... I'm slightly
tired of field operations.
If you deem it fit...
you can assign me to a
desk job for a few days.
I'm Zoya... friends call me Zee.
I'm Manish Chandra.
My friends call me Doordarshan.
Touch it to the roof of
your mouth and hit it... Dee!
Ree!
Dee.
Tang-dee...
- Correct?
Right?
Now place the order.
Very few people have the
courage to follow their heart
You are lucky.
Hey, sonny!
Yes, Mr. Bagga?
Working hard? Where are
you planning to go now?
Nowhere, Mr. Bagga...
Nothing is happening.
Come... let me drop you home then.
Sure, let's go.
- Come
You know, sonny...
the UN Foreign Ministers' meeting
is about to take place in Istanbul.
And we've intercepted a message that
the Pakistani delegates are likely
to raise the Kashmir issue again.
Ever since then...
Mr. Shenoy has asked me to
monitor every known Pakistani source.
And for the past 20 days these
random messages have messed up my mind.
To make things worse... they have set
their codes based on our film stars.
Tell me, who is supposed to be
Mallika Sherawat in the government?
I understand if they say
Gulshan Grover or Amrish Puri.
And not just films... they are
now into television as well.
One message has been intercepted
every day for the past 20 days.
That Zee TV will
surely cover the conference,
but will Doordarshan also be there?
I just don't get it... what's
their connection with Doordarshan?
Who watches Doordarshan in any case?
Mr. Bagga, I want to
see those intercepts now!
See... I intercept all this every day.
Sonny... what are you
looking for? You need my help?
You asked for a desk assignment...
So why do you want to go
to Istanbul all of a sudden?
Sir, you know that there are more spies
than diplomats in these conferences.
Sir, there will be officials
from all over the world...
Sir, it's a gold mine of
intelligence information.
How can I miss this, Sir?
Okay, Tiger... pull out your
suits and let's go to Istanbul!
Expectations are high as the
Indian and Pakistan Foreign Ministers...
On the sidelines of the UN Foreign
Ministers' Meeting at Istanbul...
It is anticipated that the
Indian and Pakistan foreign ministers
may have an informal meeting.
This is good news for the bilateral
relations of the two countries.
Get out of here... my
people will arrive soon.
Go...
Go!
Bored?
Hey... who are you?
Don't worry, I'm a friend of her's.
Drive towards the Old Town.
Old Town... okay?
Okay.
Why have you called me here, Zoya?
Tell me, Zoya.
It was very easy for you
to put a gun to my head
and tell me that you
love me... wasn't it?
As simple as that?
If the gun was in your hand...
I would have still
said the same thing.
It's not as easy as you think...
the other agent who you killed...
Feroz... he was also right there.
A girl... whose training and duty
forbids her from falling in love...
to whom could she say that yes,
she too was in love?
To the man whose real
name she didn't know?
To the man who was
pointing a gun at her?
And even had I said that...
what good would it have done?
The two of us can never be together.
And what does it mean to be together?
That we come and shake hands
every month at the Wagah border?
Or send song requests for
one another on All India Radio?
I'm ISI... you're RAW.
We are enemies.
Our duty won't let us be together.
Our people won't let us be together.
You know they'll come after us.
Yes, Captain Abrar...
I'm coming there...
Yes, sure... fine.
The sky

Hi... where have you been?
Thank you, Sir.
You were gone all evening.
I was following a lead, Sir.
Relax.
Can I please have the
pleasure of this dance?
I'm sorry but it's not
correct for me to...
What the hell is Tiger doing?
This is a peace conference...
diplomats from all over the
world are dancing with each other.
Why are Indian and Pakistani
diplomats stuck in their corners?
This is not our protocol... I'm sorry.
If you don't mind...
Thank you.
What the hell do you
think you are doing?
Zoya... you were right...
the world will never
let us be together...
so let's create our own world...
let's run away, Zoya.
You have gone mad...
don't talk nonsense.
God alone knows how long our two
countries will keep fighting...
we cannot wait for them endlessly.
And it might be a little
difficult to run when we're old.
What happens to our
lives after this music ends...
...is all in your hands, Zoya.
Tiger...
Tiger...
hurry up... we have
to go to the airport!
Hello... Zoya, are you there?
We're getting late for the airport.
Please hurry and come down.
Sir, we can't get through to
Tiger's phone. He's out of reach...
Sir... I think he's been
kidnapped by the Pakistanis.
Kidnapped! Nonsense!
He's too good for them.
Listen... this news
should not get out.
Okay, Sir.
Gopi, where have you been?
Take the next flight
from London and get here.
Which bank has he
withdrawn the money from?
How much?
Sir... a total of 47
thousand dollars, Sir...
47 thousand dollars?
Sir... about 2.3 million Rupees.
Should be 2.3 million...
the day I retire...
I'll blow it all up.
Tiger has not been kidnapped!
Do you have any idea...
how much classified information
Tiger has about our organisation?
If anyone gets hold
of that information...
it will compromise the security
of our agents all over the world.
Sir... I don't know exactly
where Tiger is or what he's up to...
but he will never give away that kind
of information whilst he's alive...
I'm certain about that.
Sir...
we just heard that...
a Pakistani delegate is also
missing since this morning.
What?
Zoya?
This is the address of the hotel.
Okay.
This hotel belongs to his friend.
He'll help us book the
tickets for tomorrow.
How long will you take?
Might take a long... maybe
all night... you take care.
Sir... this is Zoya.
Gopi... do you know how many
countries are there in the world?
Sir?
There are 201
countries in the world...
and bloody Tiger could find
a girl only from Pakistan?
Captain Abrar... why
have you called me here?
Meeting like this can
derail the whole plan.
Because I'm worried about you...
he is an extremely dangerous agent.
I am fine... but you will all
have to be a little more patient.
It's not that easy to trick him.
What you're saying is right...
but we must know what you are
up to and where exactly are you?
He does not suspect me at all...
but to get him to
you here is too risky.
I'll get him to you, but not here...
there are too many Indians here...
Iooking for him.
I'll bring him to the
airport in a little while.
We'll catch the 10:30
flight to Kazakhstan.
This is my disguise.
He'll be with me in disguise as well.
You can take our
picture at the airport
and send it to your
Kazakhstan station.
After that... he's all yours.
Take care of yourself...
Oh, my God!
For a second I
couldn't recognise you...
But I clearly recognised you.
Tickets done...
Passports done. Ready to go.
Listen to me carefully...
there on the right...
there's a man in a black jacket with
a red suitcase who's having coffee...
he's an ISI agent.
There at the luggage counter...
the guy with the camera...
behind him the man on the phone...
he's ISI as well.
Come with me... our
flight has been announced.
But our flight still
has an hour to go.
We're not going to Kazakhstan.
Then where are we going?
Let's see. Come quickly.
You knew all along?
I was an agent
before I became a lover.
But I had to do this because of
your drama at the ballroom that day...
Captain Abrar saw you and said...
this prey has
happily walked to a trap.
And right then... he
made a plan to get you.
But if you saw me
with Captain Abrar...
then why did you come
to the airport with me?
Zoya... all my life
I've used only my head...
for once I followed my heart...
I just wanted to see where
this decision would take me.
I'm amused at the thought of
what will happen in Kazakhstan now.
Seen anyone like her?
See there... in that car.
They look like bloody Indians.
Pakistani goons...
Captain Abrar...
Gopi, Sir...
Sir... it's been close to four hours
since the Istanbul flight landed...
and no one has shown up.
Alright...
Sir... the information
about Kazakhstan was wrong.
No one arrived there today.
There were two other big
flights that left Istanbul yesterday.
One to London and
the other to Frankfurt.
Then find out from there how
many other flights departed...
Sir... there are 623 flights at London
and 612 flights at Frankfurt
scheduled to take off today...
total number of passengers 825,802...
and those two could be traveling
on a passport of any nationality...
I don't care...
keep searching... we
have to find them.
Sir... my point is...
if Tiger has decided... then it
will be very difficult to find him.
We have created Tiger!
RAW was functioning before him...
and will continue even after him.
Gopi...
the amount of information that
Tiger has about our organization...
before ISI gets to that information...
we have to find
Tiger and bring him back.
And... if he doesn't want to return?
Then I'm sure you
know what we must do...
Just remember...
no one should be able
to identify his body.
Keep your eyes closed
And count slowly
Find me for I don't know where I am
Forgotten are our tales
We are strangers to our own land
See how we have turned into thin air
Close to the heart
Under the sheet of dreams
Is this lost world
Of ours
I am lost
You are lost
All our senses
Are all lost
Yes this is my wish
To think of only you
The glow that emanates from you
Will remain captured in my dreams
When did morning fall asleep?
When did the stars awaken?
We have forgotten
what happens when
I am lost
You are lost
All our senses
Are all lost
Yes I was breathing
But I was never alive
When I gave my heart away to you
I realized what a heartbeat was
Immersed in you
Lost in you
Away from you
Where do I go?
I am lost
You are lost
All our senses
Are all lost
What does it mean?
Sane love...
is no love.
Wow!
Give me your money!
Give me your money!
Give me your money!
Zoya... let's get out of here.
Zoya... let's get out of here.
What language is it?
Is it Arabic?
No, not Arabic... sounds like...
Hindi or Bengali...
Spoken in India... Pakistan...
Bangladesh... Afghanistan...
Dayal... Why have you sent me this?
Don't send me Embassy correspondence.
You should be able to
handle this at your level.
My brains get fried
with all this nonsense...
and especially when
I'm ready to go home...
Which embassy?
Havana, Sir... Cuba.
Honeymoon's over... Tiger.
We're being watched.
Eleven o' clock.
You are right... we are being watched.
Can you please come
back in 20 minutes?
Yes, Zoya?
They are saying that they
need the manager's authorisation
for such a big amount...
and he's not there...
right now they can only
give half of that amount.
Okay... get that for now.
The manager will be back in 20
minutes... this is all I could get.
I will get a car with the money...
you withdraw the rest of
the money from the bank...
don't worry... we'll be
out of here by evening.
Police please?
Stop now... you've run enough.
Zoya... look what I found...
Willy's jeep... the same '52 model.
Oh... I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to remind you of your father.
What happened?
It's over...
They were waiting for you...
we have to go and sit in that car.
Tiger, don't try anything here...
I know... they will kill
us here if they have to.
Come...
No!
Follow them... fast!
Hurry up!
Come on.
Hey, stop.
Wait... wait.
Thank you.
Tiger... Tiger, come on! Fast!
Stop it, Zoya!
Enough!
What is it that they
have and we don't?
Five minutes are more than enough...
I don't care... If you have
to shoot him... then do it
I'll call you back.
So, Gopi... you want me to be shot?
You deserve to be shot.
What have I done?
- What have you done?
Tiger, do you know how many
countries there are in the world?
201 countries... there are
201 countries and you...
203... after Kosovo
separated from Serbia.
Okay...
203 countries and you...
No... 204...
because Montenegro also
separated from Serbia.
I don't care whether there
are 203 or 204 countries!
How can you elope with a Pakistani?
Gopi... do you know how much
information Zoya can provide us?
Do you have any idea?
Zoya is ready to
come to India with us.
Really?
Then where is she?
Call her... let's leave.
For that I'll need you and your boys.
Why? You just told
me that she's ready.
Yes but those people
who she is with right now
won't let her come
to India that easily.
Who are they?
Our friends...
So let me get this straight...
you want us to
attack the ISI in Cuba...
why... to kidnap a girl?
Girl?
The same girl was your
sister-in-law in Dublin...
when you found out
she was a Pakistani...
you demoted her from
sister-in-law to just a girl?
Gopi... they are flying her to
Pakistan tomorrow morning...
Hey caveman...
whatever needs to be done,
should be done now.
What will Shenoy Sir say?
Tiger... Tiger... Tiger...
What the hell is Tiger doing?
That's the plan...
Tokas, you will be here.
Sir...
- Bablu... you'll be at this point...
Ok, Sir - Jassi, you
will block them from here.
Tiger... take this.
- Thanks, Gopi...
You, caveman... you got an
entire army just to catch me?
Sir... don't forget we
came here to catch that man
from whom we learnt everything.
One last time... you'll be here.
- Yes, sir.
Tomorrow morning sharp at eight.
Our flight will take
off in two hours...
don't try anything
strange at the airport.
Nothing is more precious
in the world for a woman...
than her honour and dignity.
And that Indian friend of yours...
he left you alone and
disappeared really fast?
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on! Go, go!
Hurry! Follow them, quick!
You rascal... God made
you and broke that mould!
Sister-in-law!
Turn around! Now!
Turn left!
Come on, go go! Airpark!
Come on! Move fast!
Stop! Stop there!
I will make it...
don't worry about me...
don't stop the plane for anything...
we'll get just this
one chance for take off!
Go, go, go!
Cut them off!
Hey, pilot... fly me to a safe place.
Hello...
Hello?
Shenoy Sir...
Speak up... Avinash Singh Rathore.
You've called me by my real
name for the very first time...
You've shown your true
colours for the first time...
No, Sir... for the first time in
my life I truly followed my heart.
You forgot your duty.
No, Sir... I never forget my duty...
I remember my duty... my training...
but I also understand that beyond
them Tiger is a human being too...
You yourself said once...
it's not easy to live with regrets.
To love your enemy is treachery...
Sir... when I was falling in love...
no one told me she was the enemy...
and when I fell in love... I couldn't
understand why she was the enemy.
Tiger...
- Sir...
How long will you keep running away?
Sir... the day India and
Pakistan don't need RAW and ISI...
that day we will come back.
Good luck.
Shenoy Sir

Naina Sethi is a sharp, young businesswoman in London with a seemingly perfect life, until her world is turned upside down when she's arrested for the murder of her lover, Arjun. Her lawyer, Jimmy Punjabi, hires renowned defence attorney Badal Gupta to help, and over the course of one evening, they work to uncover what really happened. Badal informs Naina that a witness will testify against her. Naina explains that she and Arjun were being blackmailed over their affair. They were summoned to a hotel, where she was attacked and later woke up to find Arjun dead, along with the money they had brought for the blackmailer. Although arrested, she's currently out on bail. The police found no evidence of anyone else being in the room or breaking in.

Badal suspects Naina is withholding the truth and presses her about the disappearance of a young man near the hotel. Naina then admits that a few months earlier, she and Arjun had gone to a cabin in the woods. On their way back, she accidentally hit another car, killing a young man named Sunny. Arjun convinced her not to report it, and they covered up the accident. They put Sunny's body in his car's trunk, which Naina later dumped in a swamp. While waiting for her, Arjun was invited into the home of a couple, Rani and Nirmal, who happened to be Sunny's parents. Rani grew suspicious when she heard her son's phone ring in Arjun’s pocket, as he had forgotten to get rid of it. Though Arjun and Naina managed to escape, they were worried they'd eventually be found out.

Naina later saw news reports accusing Sunny of embezzling money from the bank where he worked before disappearing. She realised that Arjun had taken Sunny’s wallet and used his girlfriend’s credentials to hack the bank and frame Sunny. Rani eventually identified Naina’s car at the scene of her son’s disappearance, but Naina's lawyer falsified an alibi. Although the police accepted it, Rani wasn't convinced. She confronted Naina at a public event, begging her to reveal Sunny's whereabouts, but Naina kept up her lie. Months later, she and Arjun were contacted by a blackmailer, leading to the events that got her arrested.

Badal theorises that Rani killed Arjun, with Nirmal’s help since he worked at the hotel. Naina admits she saw Rani in the room but had lied to test Badal’s competence. Badal then reveals that there was no witness—he had made it up to get the truth from her. Now trusting him, Naina confesses a dark secret: Sunny had still been alive in the trunk when she dumped the car, but she chose to let him die to avoid getting caught. Shocked by her actions, Badal suggests that Naina, not Arjun, orchestrated the cover-up and framed Sunny. He speculates that Arjun, overcome with guilt, went to the hotel to confess to Rani and Nirmal, and Naina killed him to keep the truth hidden. Naina denies this, insisting that her earlier story is the real one.

Badal refuses to defend Naina any further unless she admits to killing Arjun. Naina finally confesses, revealing where Sunny’s body is hidden. Badal agrees to continue helping her, but steps outside for a moment. Meanwhile, Naina receives a call from Jimmy and notices that Badal’s pen is disrupting the signal. Realizing something is wrong, she discovers that the man posing as Badal was an imposter when the real Badal Gupta arrives at her door. Horrified, Naina disassembles the pen, revealing a hidden voice recorder with her confessions. She looks out the window and sees the imposter and Rani in the apartment across from hers. The man posing as Badal removes his disguise, revealing himself as Nirmal. Rani then calls the police to have Naina arrested.",3666,NA,NA,NA

In the early 1980s, a day before her marriage, Reshma, a young girl runs away from her rude mother and village in rural Tamil Nadu and reaches Madras, hoping to become a star in Tamil cinema. She starts staying at a house located in a poor area near a single woman named Ratnamma who operates an eatery where Reshma works. Since Reshma had been raised up as a tomboy, many people seek her for her charm. Though she goes on auditioning for roles, she fails to land an opportunity. A casting director insults her for being unattractive, and gives her money for food seeing her starving condition. That night, she is invited by her neighbour to go to a movie theatre with him to watch her childhood idol Suryakanth in action. There, the man inappropriately touches her & offers 20 rupees to sleep with him. Though she storms out of the theatre in tears, she later ponders over it and determined to secure a role, visits the sets again. She spontaneously auditions for the position of a background dancer. However, she dances in a sultry manner, using erotic movements which the assistant director found attractive. But when the film's director, Abraham comes back to the set that day and sees the dance footage, he is extremely disgusted seeing her erotic dance. He edits out Reshma's entire dance sequence. Reshma and Ratnamma eagerly go to watch the movie but are crestfallen to see that her dance has not been featured in the film. The film fails at the box office in spite of being highly praised by critics, much to the dismay of the producer Selva Ganeshan, who later recalls Reshma's performance footage and includes that song in the re-release at B and C centres. The film goes on to attract large crowds due to Reshma's dance moves, despite being heavily criticised by reviewers. Just as Reshma, disheartened that her song was edited out, decides to pack up and go back to her village, producer Selva Ganeshan finds her dwelling place and offers her a role in a song in his upcoming film. Selva also suggests that she now be referred to as ""Silk"", which sounds more exotic and captivating.

At the first shoot, Silk dances with the actor Suryakanth, her childhood idol. Enamored with him, Silk gains his affection and attention by offering a long-term extra-marital sexual relationship. Meanwhile, Abraham proposes a new film to Selva Ganeshan and is keen to cast Suryakanth. However, Suryakanth's suggestion of adding sex and eroticism alongside a dance featuring Silk, to make the film more commercially viable, angers Abraham, causing him to part ways with Silk. Silk slowly builds a name for herself in the industry with her erotic dance moves and goes on to do many more sexually charged films with Suryakanth, which catapults her into stardom. She gains many male fans who buy movie tickets only to enjoy her dances and, in a short time, becomes immensely rich and popular as a sex symbol.

Suryakanth's younger brother Ramakanth, a scriptwriter by profession, is a secret fanboy of Silk and starts to befriend her. Silk secretly moves away from Suryakanth & develops a liking for Ramakanth after she realizes that he is the first man who loves her for more than just her body and sex appeal & that Suryakanth will never abandon his wife to marry her. Silk visits her hometown with Ramakanth and is happy to see the crowd gathering around to see her, but is left heartbroken when her mother slams the door in her face without greeting her. At an awards ceremony Silk is insulted by Suryakanth who whispers to her that she is nothing more than everyone's ""dirty secret"". Hurt by his remarks, Silk delivers her award receiving speech in which she criticises the misogynistic double standards of the society which names & shames women acting in erotically charged films but not the men who produce, distribute, consume & spread those same material. She declares that she will continue to make her ""dirty pictures"" until the society changes its views. Silk's relationship with Ramakanth is released to the public after noted journalist Naila criticizes her for having a romantic relationship with both brothers. To seek revenge, Suryakanth drops Silk from his forthcoming films, forcing her to work with other filmmakers, who repeatedly typecast her as a seductress, which causes her to lose interest in her work & fall out with the directors. Now in the 90s, directors start to make the main actresses do the sultry dances instead of hiring dancers like Silk who specialised in such dance moves, causing shrinkage in her employability. By this time, Silk had also put on weight, losing her status as a sex symbol & begins to feel threatened by a younger aspiring actress, Shakeela. During a dance challenge in a party, she tries to outshine Shakeela by dancing more and more erotically and finally intentionally trips Shakeela, much to the embarrassment of Ramakanth who had been planning to introduce Silk to his parents as a prospective bride at that party. Silk & Ramakanth argue over this incident, during which she says that she isn't ashamed keeping her seductive image offscreen, which causes Ramakanth to break-up with her. To ease her heartbreak, Silk who had already been into drinking and smoking, turns to alcohol addiction and chain smoking & as a result begins to show symptoms of depression and obesity.

Silk now approaches Selva Ganeshan with an offer to produce a film together starring her in a triple role as a seductress. At the same time Abraham also directs a film starring himself in a triple role, containing commercial eroticism with Ramakanth as his scriptwriter. Both the films are released on the same day, & while Abraham's film becomes a commercial success, Silk's film drastically fails at the box office. He feels that he has finally proven to Silk (and himself) that he has defeated Silk. But Abraham begins to take a liking towards Silk even though he claims to hate her.

Having lost her fame and fortune Silk had accumulated so much debt (due to her addiction of placing bets on racing horses) that she was on the verge of homelessness. Out of desperation, she approaches a small-time filmmaker, willing to take on any role. He intoxicates her with alcohol and starts filming her in a hardcore pornographic film without her permission. The place is raided by the police & Silk manages to escape. In her intoxicated state, she has several visions of her past, encounters Ratnamma's shop on the way and tries to hide from being seen by her out of shame, realising that she had come back to the same position (as an object of lust) as she was before her film career began. Completely heartbroken and inundated with substance abuse, she reaches her house and cries out bitterly.

Abraham finds himself falling in love with Silk, even though he denies it at first, as he struggles with this moral dilemma. After coming to know about Silk's loneliness & loveless personal life, he goes to Silk's hometown and convinces her mother to accompany him to visit her at Madras. He tries to call Silk over phone in an attempt to surprise her but she doesn't pick up. When he finally got Silk on phone, Abraham becomes alarmed when she asks him to bid farewell to everyone for her. He rushes to her house and finds her lying in bed, dressed modestly in a red sari like a housewife (a role she had been denied in life), dead from a sleeping pill overdose, along with a suicide note written by her.

A tearful Abraham and Silk's mother cremates Silk's body. The film ends with Abraham's narration, examining the life that Silk has led, and he questions whether it was her or her life that was right or wrong. He also thinks that Silk must be right now creating an uproar in the other world as well, because that is her nature.",7975,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt1954206.srt","Mother.. I've heard that..

So, who is better?
Me or a boy?
Stop talking nonsense.
It's all rubbish!
Now don't be so coy. You're no less.
I can tell a lot of men have
been hard at work over here.
Stop it!
What?
Last night was fun.
Tonight could be even better.
My wife has a night-shift...
so tonight...
I merely touched you and it leaked...
your pen!
If I come over, what
will become of you?
You bitch!
My wife is right about you.
She is right about you too!
You like to go riding but you can
barely stay on for a few seconds.
You are mine...
so why hide from you...
You can take a peek.
When you will truly be mine,
then you can see the entire picture!
You can go in...
You can also go in...
You are out...
you can go back.
Okay, you can go in.
You are out.
- Sir... - You can't come in.
- The selection is done. - Sir,
sir... I want to be an actor, sir.
And I wanted to be a director.
Sir, I don't want to
dance like other girls.
I want to act, sir.
And I wanted to make offbeat films.
Sir, I'll do
anything to become an actor.
And to become a director
I could not do anything.
Would you like to see
what's not in these pictures?
Do you want to hear
the story of my film?
Sir, you aren't even listening to me.
Sir, step out of your film.
And you step out of your dreams.
There are 25 like
you waiting outside...
and tomorrow there will be 50 more.
You're good for nothing.
Neither do you have the seductive charm
of a lover nor the grace of a wife.
You are very dull.
I've been living on
sugar for two days...
so how can I look spicy?
Hold on...
take this and have something to eat.
And think about what you
want to do with your life.
Not everyone can become an actor.
Let's go somewhere else.
Why?
We can be by ourselves
at some late night show.
It will be fun.
I'll pay you.
How much?
20 rupees.
Only 20 rupees for me?
Take it.
Bloody pervert!
You're at the end of your life
and you want a fresh climax?
Neither do you have the seductive charm
of a lover nor the grace of a wife.
You are very dull.
Not everyone can become an actor.
There are 25 like
you waiting outside...
and tomorrow there will be 50 more.
Just a minute...
I'm not dull.
Who are you? What do you want?
Don't you remember?
You gave me some money
before rejecting me.
Here's your money.
I'm sure I have something for
which that guy forked out 20 rupees.
Sudhir, where is that girl?
How do I shoot the song sequence?
Where do I get a girl who
won't mind ripping her own skin?
Your whip scares the girls away...
You want me to do it?
Think you can bear the pain?
I bore it for so long, I'm
sure I can bear it ahead too.
Pan the camera.
Some say the glass is half full...
some say it's half empty.
And some are like Silk.
They say at least there is a drink.
Enjoy it.
It's stupidity.
But often stupidity manages
to get things done that...
hard work and intelligence can't.
Sir...
Sir... sir...
You want to take the camera
through the girl? - Do you?
What sort of a shot is this?
You horny bastard, filthy mind...
- Sir... - Shut up!
You play the flute behind my
back and now you want to sing!
Give me that reel.
Please sit, sir...
I left the shot for one
day and see what happened.
Where is it? Stop it!
Sir, we'll cut it, please...
If you don't cut the reel,
I'll cut you somewhere...
and then you won't know
whether to wear trousers or skirts!
What's the occasion, Amma?
You're all dressed to kill.
Who is the poor guy?
Check out the newspaper,
your movie is out today.
Aren't we going for
‘first day, first show'?
Look...
Amma...
wait here, I'll just get ready.
Everybody should know that...
every film has only one hero...
Director!
Every film one hero...
Who?
Director!
Everybody is staring at you.
Who is that?
- The director.
Oh...
- Come on!
Take off your sunglasses.
Where is our seat?
Amma, we'll watch my
first film from up close.
You mean it's the first row?
Here it is.
No, here.
- Wow, it's Selva
Ganesh's film. - Yes!
His films are entertaining.
Off with your sunglasses.
- Amma... - Yes?
Mark my words, now all
my problems will go away.
The dance director said
he liked my performance.
Really?
Another thing, Amma...
My life has moved from
‘pack up' to ‘action'.
Now I won't let it slip away.
Hey! Shhh!
Stop talking.
What do you mean 'shhh'?
She is the heroine.
She is the heroine?
The heroine?
If she is the heroine,
can I get a refund?
Is this your song?
No.
This one?
Probably this is your song.
No...
Where is it?
Where is your song?
Miss Heroine...
heroine...
Can I at least have your autograph?
What has she done?
She's there in the whole film.
Reshma...
Madam... can I have your autograph?
People in Hollywood are
probably wondering..
..why I am wasting
my talent in India.
I wish you had left for Hollywood
before putting me into a loss.
I would have been better off.
Sir, you haven't
tasted real respect yet.
Nayla has written
such a fantastic review.
Look at the wonderful
things that have been printed.
Hey... You english show-off!
I would've been happy if at
least the tickets were sold.
Sir, you wait and watch...
because of this film, you
will have a trophy in your hand.
And a begging bowl in the other.
Nowhere in the film did
the 'hero reason' come alive.
Not 'hero reason'.
It's heroism.
If you know it, why
didn't you portray it?
Sir, the thing is...
one man thrashing a dozen bad guys and a
dozen hot girls falling for one man...
doesn't click with the audience.
Real films are those that
compel the audience to think.
The audience wants to
feel something else...
and you want them to feel their mind?
Sir...
Abraham sir deleted one song.
That song would have worked wonders.
Which song?
This one... take a look.
Let me watch it.
Dear friend...
you should go to Hollywood.
We will miss you but you should go.
You robbed the film of its life!
Life?
You mean... that fatso...
I will add this song as
a special feature and...
release the film
again in smaller towns.
That will definitely
recover some money.
Abraham, what are you doing?
what are you doing?
Abraham... what are you doing?
What did you do that for?
You've set the positive on fire.
I still have the negative.
Mark my words, this girl
will set the screen on fire!
Hey, What are you doing?
I'm taking a picture.
You can't do that, get out!
Ticket, ticket...
Blackie!
Blackie... listen...
I want a ticket.
Not you again!
The amount you have spent
on watching this film...
would have got you the girl.
- Are you serious? - Of course!
Selva Ganesh has
proved once again that...
he will go to any
length to make money.
This is not a film,
it's a volley of abuses.
This is the respect that I like.
The more these critics pan my film,
the more my film will earn for me.
Well done, Vimal. Good job.
Thank you, sir.
I want this girl.
If merely her glimpse can
arouse the crowd to this extent...
imagine what will happen if
she danced to an entire song!
Get her.
But sir, I don't know who
she is or where she came from.
Well then, find out.
I'm sure someone knows.
If she is present in the song, surely
she hasn't appeared out of thin air.
Find her!
Yes, sir.
This girl will be my
biggest discovery.
Who is it?
What is it?
G...G...G...
G... G... what? Who are you?
What do you want?
Money!
What's this?
That's one less than hundred.
Why?
I bought this for one rupee.
Are you high? Should I
bring you back to reality?
Forgot everything?
Film... I saw your film.
Ever since then I've
been saving up for you.
You are lying!
I haven't acted in any film.
Go away from here...
get lost!
The middle word in life is... ""if"".
The big ""if'!
If only that bastard Selva Ganesh
had spent five more minutes..
..in the bathroom...
if only he had driven 5 kmph slower...
everybody's life would
have remained the same.
But no.
He was eager to screw me and how!
Even sitting on a
couch didn't feel safe.
The sun arose that morning
to shine bright on Reshma...
and to burn me to ashes.
Baby, should I call for more?
Enough, Amma.
Baby, all the people who've had
breakfast with me in the past...
today enjoy dinner at 5-star hotels.
Join hands with me and the world
will praise you with hands joined.
Have some more... keep eating.
And you will be the best.
I can see it, you have that...
desire.
Silk!
Today onwards your name is Silk.
And your name is Mr. Worm.
What?
Silk is created by worms.
Baby, whether I'm
Selva Ganesh or Mr. Worm...
but all I am is an
opportunity for you.
And this opportunity
won't come by again...
it will only go to someone else.
Okay, sir...
music...
One, two, three, four...
Silk, no heat...
no heat!
We want to titillate the public...
not put them to sleep.
And sir, extraordinary shot.
Sir, extraordinary...
but one more, sir, please.
Cut it!
Silk, what are you doing?
Imagine Surya sir is
a log of sandalwood.
And you are a serpent...
wrap yourself around him.
And Surya sir, very good shot.
But she's a newcomer, sir.
One more shot, sir, please.
George...
Surya gives only one take. That's it.
Here I am...
Sir, please, sir...
A day with Surya is worth
a hundred thousand rupees!
Understand?
A good looking fruit
isn't always sweet!
Set up my solo shot.
Hey you...
come here.
What's your name?
Reshma...
Silk.
Two names to go by and you
can't do one silly step.
See this...
plastic cover?
Whether it's there or not...
it makes no
difference to the cigarette.
Similarly...
whether you are in this film or not...
it makes no difference to anyone.
You know something...
if there's no cover and it rains...
the cigarette won't even light up.
Pack up!
Heroine says that it's going to rain.
I've been hit by a
shoe because of you.
But I won't let it happen again.
You made Surya sir very angry.
You go!
And don't ever come back.
What are you doing in here?
I'm here to get tuned, and
then we can make some music.
You switched your
melody pretty quickly.
It's your personality, sir.
I've been admiring you
since I was a little girl.
I was scared to be next to you.
Now that's believable.
If God puts in an appearance...
the devotee is bound to be scared.
Sir, please give me another chance.
Why should 1?
I'll be devoted to you.
I'll do anything you want me to.
Don't you read the magazines?
The magazines say that...
I've tuned 500 girls.
But have you ever
tuned one girl 500 times?
- Is it true about the 500... - No...
501!
Sir, Surya won't act with her.
Sir, there they come.
I guess Surya sir is all charged up.
Suryakant may die but he
won't let go of a new girl.
Cut...
What?
She's doing it all wrong again,
she missed a beat.
To hell with the beat,
look at that heat...
she'll set everyone on fire.
Extraordinary, sir, very good, sir.
Mind-blowing, sir,
very good shot, sir.
Madam...
ticket please.
That's your seat, sit there.
How does it matter?
This place is empty.
I don't want problems later.
Go and sit according to your ticket.
Mother...
congratulate me.
Your son has stood first in college.
Bless you, my dear.
You've fulfilled all my wishes.
If only your dad were alive today...
Cut it!
Very good shot, Surya sir.
Excellent shot.
Just like a young boy.
That was... that was very good.
You are very convincing as my mother.
Naylaji!
What a pleasure, what brings you here?
Last month's
magazine hasn't sold well?
Probably because you
didn't grace the cover!
So what's brewing... under cover?
This is new!
Lalitha was the heroine in your
last film and both of you were hot.
And now she is playing your mother?
You see...
youth is meant to be tasted...
not wasted!
A heroine's life...
is like an elected government.
The party lasts for five years...
after that it's there for support.
Sometimes left... sometimes right...
and sometimes even centre!
I've heard that new girl, Silk, is a
passionate supporter of your party.
Everybody is talking about her.
Of course, I gave her a break.
She is very talented.
When God has blessed
her so abundantly...
there's no harm in
taking a piece of the pie.
Right?
You know me...
I believe the more I can be of
help to others, the better it is.
But she is a quite down market.
You write up on her was perfect.
Well, I have to, Surya sir.
To portray men as saints...
women have to be depicted as demons.
Sir, madam is here.
Yes.
See you later.
What about my interview?
We'll do it later.
This is important.
Quick, some filter coffee for madam.
Is Silk here?
The cinema hall was filled with men...
every one of them only to see me.
And as soon as the
song was over, they left.
It was amazing.
Don't be so excited.
Take a look at what
Nayla has to say about you.
Who is Nayla?
The most important film
critic and gossip queen.
When she writes,
everybody pays attention.
She says Selva took the
help of dirt to sell his film.
Dirt...
that's you.
Look at my picture, it's so gorgeous.
Now, I will stop at nothing.
Help me with more work...
But why should I help you?
Because I love you and...
we still have 499 times
remaining to get tuned.
Come in...
So, Akbar and Anarkali
are on talking terms?
Sir, good sense of humour, sir.
Abraham, this is Silk.
Hello.
Surya sir, I want to talk
to you about my next film.
And this film will showcase you.
You won't need a cheap and
disgusting act to promote this film.
Abraham, everybody
knows you make good films.
Thank you, sir.
I owe it all to idli, rasam and rum.
But your films aren't...
commercially successful.
They captivate the
audience at film festivals but...
they fail to bring in even
a dog at local theatres.
Is that right?
Right, sir.
Spice it up, Abraham, spice it up.
Add some sex.
Have Silk dance to a number
or two, whatever you like.
Let me tell you...
successful films are those that...
have the right spice.
Right, Selva?
You are genius, sir.
It's a curse, Selva. It's a curse.
Sir, I'm a director, not a pimp.
I want to make a film, not sell sex.
Perhaps you can work with
that cheap girl but I can't!
Right.
Fine, Selva you direct it.
Okay, sir.
Then bye.
I wasn't dejected that
they chose Silk over me...
I was dejected that
they decided so quickly.
Why do you have a problem with me?
I have a problem with your parents.
They shouldn't have
given birth to you.
My parents didn't give birth to me.
Silk was brought into this world...
by the people who admire me.
Your admirers occupy the
first four rows in a cinema hall.
The 40 rows at the back are mine.
I will prove that films don't
need gimmicks like you to sell.
Films need three things to sell...
entertainment,
entertainment, entertainment!
And I am entertainment.
A woman is like a rainbow.
As many faces as the colors.
Some consider her a lottery.
If you win, you've hit the jackpot!
Some think of her as love.
If you fall in love with her...
you will gasp for every breath!
But she ravaged me like poison.
That now even water
burns me up from inside!
Your sweet torment
surreptitious torment
Here and around
I am angry
you are the reason
Cajole me my love
I will tease you
you are a bombastic girl
Aha Aha Aha
Ooh la la, Ooh la Ia,
Ooh lala, Ooh lala
You are my fantasy
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me
I am a young lady now
Ooh la la, Ooh la Ia,
Ooh lala, Ooh lala
You are my fantasy
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me
I am a young lady now
When touched by you
my heart whistled
Give me a sweet kiss on my cheeks
When touched by you
my heart whistled
Give me a sweet kiss on my cheeks
Your youth, is fluid
which has drenched my heart
Aha you brought the rain
what could my poor youth do?
Ooh la la, Ooh la Ia,
Ooh lala, Ooh lala
You are my fantasy
No no no no no
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me
I am a young lady now
By dropping your saree repeatedly
you make me restless
By dropping your saree repeatedly
you make me restless
After storming a fire in me
what can the poor saree do
Poor thing
Oh poor thing
I will tease you
you are a bombastic girl
Oh no
Ooh la la, Ooh la Ia,
Ooh lala, Ooh lala
You are my fantasy
Ah ah
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me
I am a young lady now
Hey hey hey hey
Ooh la la, Ooh la Ia,
Ooh lala, Ooh lala
You are my fantasy
Oh oh
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me
I am a young lady now
You want to interview me?
At my place?
This evening... great!
- Amma... - What is it?
it was a call from Manorama magazine.
They want to interview me.
They want to show the
world how stars live.
No film star lives like you do.
Refuse them.
Amma, these opportunities
don't come by again and again...
they will only pass
on to someone else.
What will you show?
The tiny room you live in?
I brought this deer from Africa.
Superb, sir.
This gun is an antique from Bulgaria.
Sir, deep breath, stomach in.
Click my picture...
Click my picture...
Go away... get lost!
Oops... you're early.
Ma'am...
I can come back later.
Now that you are here,
let's begin the interview.
You mean like this?
But have you worn something?
Do you bathe with your clothes on?
No.
Exactly!
Having a bath with your
clothes on is cheating...
and Silk doesn't cheat.
What you see is what you get!
What are you doing?
You are only taking my pictures
What about my house?
When the goddess is
present in her full glory...
who cares about the temple?
Thanks to Silk I was out of work.
All day and night
she danced in my mind.
But she didn't care a
damn about these things.
She was running in a race...
where you must look straight ahead.
Sir...
Silk is very good at
creating headlines.
But this isn't right, sir.
A girl, that too an actress...
moreover on the front page!
Bad news, sir.
She's flying high.
Let her.
No matter how high the popcorn goes...
it always falls back in the pan.
Excellent, sir, excellent!
That's brilliant!
What are you looking for?
Someone from Manorama
had interviewed me too...
but those idiots
didn't print anything!
When will you grow up?
You brought all this
to your new house too!
What if Surya sees it?
He will be pleased
that before I met him...
I would make do with his pictures.
Surya and you are worlds apart.
I'm worried.
A thousand girls like
you are crazy for him.
And a thousand guys
like him are crazy for me.
What's to worry?
We have the world at our feet.
He has another life...
he is married.
If I had met him earlier,
perhaps he would have married me...
and I would've been his wife's place.
""If"", ‘perhaps', 'l would've been'...
when these words crop up in love,
it's better to step back.
Amma, I know I don't
have any right on Surya.
But what can I do?
There are no brakes in love.
Let's talk about something else, Amma.
You know something, sit...
do you hear that?
What?
- Listen carefully.
I don't hear anything.
Precisely! That's the
best part of living here.
You don't hear the
neighbours and no unwanted sounds.
Silk, make it more seductive.
This scene should
make the public go wild.
Make it hot.
Leave me!
Mr. Worm, take your shot.
That was fantastic.
What a shot!
Very good, very good...
So Silk...
were you thinking about Surya sir?
Why think about someone, with
whom I can be whenever I want to!
Ratnamma, I have
dialogues in this film.
I'm very nervous.
Why?
People will laugh at me.
Why did the Worm
have to have a premiere?
I won't attend the premiere.
Why not?
Ratnamma, I'm a dancer.
I don't even have the
‘ting' of acting in me.
You listen to me
nothing will happen...
I know her... listen to me.
Let me at least talk to her.
- Silk madam... - You can't go in.
Ratnamma... I'll call you later.
Just let me talk to her!
Silk madam... Silk madam!
Madam...
how are you, madam?
You!
Silk madam... how are you?
I'm good.
God is playing games with me.
I thought...
a thousand rupees
might be enough but...
you... you seem to be... very rich.
Even a million won't be enough.
You know something...
you've been lucky for me.
Every time you appear...
something good definitely happens.
Now you're leaving me high and dry.
I'm giving the security
guard a thousand for the kiss.
Thanks a lot, madam.
You are very nice.
Some people make
films touch the heart.
Some people make films touch the mind.
The body part they wanted to touch...
well, this film was a hit there!
Thank you...
- Very nice. - You liked it?
What a film, what a film!
You liked it?
Like?
I haven't seen such a
disgusting film in my life.
There's something nice
and superb about this film.
Silk?
Now you will realise that to make a
good film you need a good director...
not a dancer!
But don't you worry.
You think this film will do well?
Not a chance.
But I am still
willing to work with you..
because you gave me my first break.
Here...
have this and...
even the abuses will sound sweet.
Mr. Worm!
That bastard ripped everything apart!
Forget about him.
I am sure even his
alcohol is as bad as him.
But...
what if his words come true?
We haven't made this film for him.
Our fate will be decided on Friday.
Industry has sunk to new lows...
thanks to Selva Ganesh and...
more importantly Silk.
By Nayla.
Down with Silk!
Down with Silk!
Hello Silk...
It's been so long.
Is this the first time you're here?
You act very well even in reality!
Sir, a little closer, please.
Yes, that's fine.
Let's go inside.
The action always takes place inside.
All night you stick to me like glue...
otherwise you don't
even want to hold me.
Hello...
Control yourself, Silk.
The people here know me.
If my wife hears about this,
it won't be good.
See you later at the farmhouse.
So, now what?
Enjoy the race.
Lay a bet on a good horse.
I've bet on you.
Don't let me down.
Evening... farmhouse.
That's Silk.
What is she doing here?
Are people like her allowed in here?
Let alone her films, I
don't even look at the posters!
You!
You are... here at the race course...
Why not?
Can't I come to the race course?
I'm a star too.
You think only these
well dressed people
with their English
accents can come here?
You are Silk, aren't you?
Yes, so what?
I am your fan.
I didn't think
anybody here would know me.
Apart from a dozen
horses and a few asses...
there's no one here
who doesn't know you.
Thank you.
I want to lay a wager
that number 9 will win.
How do I do it?
Silk madam, don't bet on that horse.
This horse has never won.
Nobody has ever bet on him.
Did anyone imagine that
India would defeat West Indies
in the cricket world cup final?
But India won!
If nobody bets on him,
why will he win?
He's a horse, not an ass.
Here's the money.
It will.
Ramakant sir...
finally someone bet on your horse.
This horse never won a race for me...
but I hope he wins this race for Silk.
Come on come on, Mountain Storm.
At night you prefer to be like
the hands of a clock at 12 o'clock.
But during the day,
your clock says 6 o'clock.
I have to control, Silk.
Yesterday if we were seen together...
you would've lost nothing...
but I would've lost everything.
So, which horse did you bet on?
The horse that won.
I'm the horse that wins.
- Surya! - Radhika!
Go hide in there...
Surya!
Yes? Just coming...
Go in will you...
Go in...
Press my head no one does it like you.
Silk never took the easy path.
Then how could her life ever be easy?
She had broken a million hearts...
and now her heart was at stake.
People say only the heart
breaks but they're wrong.
Every single part of the
body goes into mourning.
The throat becomes dry...
and cheeks remain cold...
eyes welled up with tears...
and heart... empty.
I learnt about Silk's
misery much later...
otherwise I would've celebrated.
Excuse me!
Are you alright?
Why wouldn't I be?
Should I get a taxi for you?
Why? Don't you have a car?
You... will come along... with me?
Why not? Are you going to rape me?
What?
Why would you say that?
Excuse me...
just a minute, please.
Don't worry. Just do it.
What?
You aren't the first man to think...
‘while shifting the gear if
I could somehow touch her.'
What... no...
I wasn't thinking of that.
You work for Suryakant?
I'm his brother.
Suryakant... Ramakant...
brothers.
Did you see his wife go in?
Yes.
That's when you figured that...
since the permanent one
is in, I will sneak out.
One brother takes me to bed and...
the other is
erecting a bed in his mind!
Why are your
thoughts always so twisted?
Because virtue doesn't
stand a chance in this world.
What do you do?
I'm a writer. I write.
Which was your last film?
I haven't got the first one yet.
And you'll never get one.
Why not?
According to you, there's
only one hero in your family.
And that's Suryakant.
According to you, who is he?
Hero or...
a villain?
I've given up classifying people.
Moreover...
the hero and villain don't matter...
because I'm the vamp in every story.
I want to go home...
will you take me there?
Yes.
You see that window?
I escaped from it on
the eve of my wedding.
Won't you go in?
Mother...
This award goes to Silk.
And to give this award...
I would like to call Mr. Suryakant.
I want to present an award to the
person who chose Silk for this award.
She is despicable and...
the person who chose her even worse.
But mister... who the hell are you?
Abraham...
director.
Been a long time since I saw you.
I finally realised...
where to be seen and where not.
Success has gone to your head.
But many like you have come and gone.
I haven't come here to go away.
Look, I'm up here and
the others are down there.
You think the people
down there adore you?
They are laughing at you.
They know very well that
you don't belong with us.
You are the fantasy from last night..
..that nobody talks about
the next morning.
You are our dirty secret!
At least say thanks...
I really don't know
where to begin from.
If I begin right at the start,
my mother will be hurt.
If I talk about the present,
you might feel offended.
Because today I won't stop.
Everybody's right eye is twitching
and heart on the left is throbbing...
anticipating what I'm about to say.
You must be
wondering why you ever put...
a nobody like me on a pedestal.
Some people are famous
because of what they do.
I'm infamous for what I do.
Vulgar...
disgusting...
sexy...
dirty...
the words that are
applied to describe me.
Just so someone's
film could take off...
I was used as a boarding pass.
Yet people say I'm vulgar.
You made me dance...
but nobody noticed my
effort or my sincerity.
You were busy noticing something else.
Yet you label me disgusting...
sexy...
My films are not meant to be
watched with the family but...
people watch them alone and
end up with a bigger family.
If I open a few buttons...
then everyone will break into a sweat.
Don't you worry...
I'm leaving...
because except for me,
everyone else here is honourable.
But I must say, your
honour is unbelievable.
You make films about sex,
you sell them...
you watch them, you show them...
you even present them with awards...
but you're scared to acknowledge them.
Neither will you change, nor will I.
Wrap yourself with your
so-called-honour and...
I will carry on shedding my clothes.
I will continue making
these Dirty Pictures.
And I will bring these
Dirty Pictures before you.
Who are you?
Nayla.
Oh!
So it is you who writes
all the bad stuff about me.
It will be bad if I
stop writing about you.
What do you mean?
I mean...
what you're doing
today is a rebellion.
Years later people
will call it freedom.
I don't get you.
Stay as you are...
like a storm...
don't think too much.
Because if you do, you'll fade away.
I am Silk.
I'm not some film that will
change after the interval.
That's Surya's wife and
she's coming towards us.
Finally I've met you.
I've heard a lot about you.
I'm sure you have...
but there's a lot more to me.
I like you better in
person than on the screen.
I heard a lot about you
too and you're less either.
He looks just like his father.
He even behaves like him.
You have no idea...
what it is like to
be a superstar's wife.
Even so there isn't a lot
of difference between us.
No...
there is a lot of difference.
No, Radhikaiji...
the difference is as big as a mole.
I have a mole near my heart and...
you have one...
on what you sit.
What? How do you know?
Your face gave it away.
That you have a mole...
right where I said it is.
Hey writer boy!
Are you going to stand by
your brother and not talk to me?
You're pretending as
if you don't know me.
What do you want?
Tell me.
What I want...
can only be enjoyed at night.
Night?
Why not now?
What will people think?
What will Surya think?
Right here, right now?
This is between you and me.
Actually...
things didn't work out with Surya.
Now it's all up to you.
I'll see you at night... alone!
What are you doing?
You are doing it all wrong.
Do it right.
Don't hold it, let me do it.
You're doing it all wrong.
I know how to slide it in.
Is this your first time?
Never mind me.
Slide it in properly.
We haven't even moved
yet and you're all wet!
Whatever you do, do it nice and easy.
Now ease into first gear...
slowly.
Easy, yes... slowly...
Look straight ahead.
slowly...
Yes, that's the way.
Look straight ahead.
What are you doing?
Look straight ahead.
Now add a little pressure on
this pedal, it's the accelerator.
Okay...
Thanks.
Now that you've bought a car...
you should've hired a driver as well.
I bought the car from
the winnings at the derby.
I can't decide whether...
I should hire a driver or a jockey.
Do you know that was my horse?
Well then...
you are lucky for me.
No, you are lucky.
I saw you whispering to
the horse before the race.
What did you say?
It seemed depressed.
I said nobody has
ever looked at my feet.
Hold your head high and
leave everyone behind.
And it did.
Your words are so loaded
with horsepower that...
they rein in the wild spirit in men..
..While they revive
the sagging spirit of horses.
Tell me...
who holds your reins?
Meaning?
If I spell it out, you'll blush.
Do you have a girlfriend?
No.
Why not?
In the beginning,
a girlfriend is delicious as cream...
but then she slowly
engulfs you like cholesterol...
and finally strikes
like a heart attack!
Fine, I'll see for myself...
how long an ascetical celibate like you
can resist the charms of a single woman.
Ooh la la, Ooh la Ia,
Ooh lala, Ooh lala
You are my fantasy
Ah ah
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me
I am a young lady now
Hey hey hey hey
Ooh la la, Ooh la Ia,
Ooh lala, Ooh lala
You are my fantasy
Oh oh
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me
I am a young lady now
Trying to meet you is like
jumping across an electric fence.
Sit.
You can get a 440 volt shock anytime!
Did you think I'm AAA battery?
I'm a transformer.
Transformer!
Are you planning on
giving me something lethal?
Are you out of breath already?
You better save some.
What is this?
Neither is it your birthday nor mine.
So what's this cake for?
Blow away your old life.
And wish your new
one a happy birthday.
What do you think you're doing?
Are you okay?
Many who have gained fame
hide behind their black deeds.
At least you are covered in white.
You are crazy.
Happy Birthday.
- What are you doing! - To you too!
Hello!
Hey guys, stop press now!
Anything new about Silk?
I have something that
will create a sensation.
Tell us, Nayla. What did Silk do now?
I haven't thought about it.
About what?
What do I label Silk?
Manipulative or helpless?
Vamp or just a victim?
How are the pictures?
I'll cut them out.
What about the
rubbish written about us?
I don't know what has been written.
In fact, I don't care and never did!
I cut out the pictures,
but only if they are good.
A newspaper may go stale in a day...
but the news in it remains
fresh for years to come.
And these journalists never
write anything good about you.
Now they've labelled you Draupadi.
Ma'am...
Nayla madam is busy at the party.
She said she can't meet anyone
and I shouldn't let anyone in.
Didn't you tell her it's Silk?
Yes, ma'am, I know you. I told her.
What's this party about?
Ma'am, the party is to celebrate
Nayla madam's best journalist award.
A lot of high profile people
and celebrities are present.
Thank you.
Kumar...
call the police.
I guess they heard I'm on the way.
Yes, sir.
But they are looking in
the opposite direction.
Honk... honk!
Otherwise they won't give way.
I can't stay here like these idiots.
Let's go back.
I'll check what's going on.
Are you alright?
What are you doing?
Stealing the thunder
from Nayla's party.
You are unbelievable, Silk.
Why ruin just one party,
when I can ruin two!
Driver, start the car... come on!
There are many stars in
this industry, Silk...
but there's only one hero
- you.
That was unbelievable.
You publicly wrecked
her private party.
Now Nayla will never celebrate
anything, not even her birthday!
Once Silk decides on something,
she goes through with it.
Surya, for instance.
His mouth was open
like an uncovered manhole.
I hope you didn't mind...
me kissing you.
My heart said so and I did.
Even though the
heart is on the left...
its decisions are always right.
Wow, the writer rises...
You should sleep.
Tomorrow I have
narrate the story to Vijayan.
And you have a shoot too.
We just left two
people burning with anger...
and you want to put it out?
If I stay back, a fire
will start over here.
Then let it.
Ooh lala, Ooh lala
You are my...
You don't call out to
others when you're on the edge.
The bullet exits the gun...
The villain's spirit exits his body...
The end of the film.
And the audience exits the theater.
What kind of ending is this?
I didn't even have a fight sequence.
Swords are pulled
out of their sheath...
Clothes ripped apart...
Bodies ripped apart... Blood all over.
That leads to the end of the film.
You should have a sword fight,
yes a sword fight.
Sir, the lead hero is a cop.
How could he have a sword?
That's a valid point.
Perhaps an ancestral sword...
a family heirloom.
But, Sir... the lead
hero is an orphan.
Boring!
Boring!
Lead heroes of the 60s
and 70s were orphans.
We are in the 80s now.
Let him have a family.
And a sister...
give her dignity...
And then take it away!
His sister's trampled dignity...
should reflect on his sword.
Now that will heighten the climax!
What do you say, Vijayan?
Sir, what an imagination!
Genius... Sir, you're a genius!
It's a curse, Vijayan. It's a curse!
What do you think, Rama?
I have one word...
Superhit!
Sir, sensational, this
will be sensational!
Silk couldn't differentiate
between a man and a horse.
A horse at its peak will win derbies.
But a man at his peak
moves like time itself.
Then he can neither stop.
Do you remember...
when we first met...
you couldn't utter a word.
And now you make excuses!
There was a time when I'd merely
think of you and you would show up.
And now...
you think twice before meeting me.
Cut it!
What are you laughing for?
You think this is a joke?
You are the one making a joke, madam.
We shot this scene yesterday.
I need a cigarette!
Silk...
what's going on?
Once upon a time,
you'd act out a scene and..
..I didn't feel like calling
out ‘cut'.
But it seems like you
don't feel like acting anymore.
How can I?
There's nothing new to do.
Everyday it's the same old scene,
same old dialogue, same old story.
You can only act in
one particular film...
and I'll make it.
I know why you're so arrogant today.
You've signed on
that new girl, Shakeela.
But Venkat sir...
there can never be another Silk.
And we don't want another Silk!
Everyday it's something new.
A new spat with Surya...
or a new scene with his brother.
Or your love for the bottle.
In that case, ‘pack up'!
Make this film with that...
that girl... Shakeela!
Silk, wait,
don't make a mistake. you'll regret.
People who walk out on their work...
spend the rest of their
lives begging for work.
But they get nothing.
I am Silk.
Silk.
Don't forget I'm a star.
When stars fade away, they
become one with the darkness.
And when the bare darkness strikes...
the first thing it takes
away is the star's shine.
Hello...
Ramakant, please.
Madam, he is busy at a pooja.
[Religious offering]
Pooja?
For what?
Madam, it's a pooja for his new film.
Tell Ramakant it's Silk!
Sorry madam, I can't disturb him.
Hello...
Hello, give the phone to Ramakant!
Madam...
Tell Ramakant it's Silk!
It's Silk madam on the line.
She wants to talk to you.
Tell her I'll call her later.
Okay.
I'm sorry, madam.
I can't disturb him.
Suryakant sir...
Sir, I'm very happy.
One brother will write,
the other will act.
Today is a great day.
And Silk will dance.
Excuse me.
Vijayan!
Yes, sir?
Silk...
will not act in this film.
The audience has seen
every inch of her talent.
Sir, as you wish.
But sir...
the public demands excitement.
We will change the trend.
Everything that Silk did...
we'll get the heroine to do.
That's fine...
sir but what about
the heroine's image?
The public goes for the goods on
display, the store doesn't matter.
when honour is disrobed...
it's the 'honourable'
ones that enjoy it the most.
You're right, absolutely right, sir.
Ramakant, what do you have to say?
Sir...
Silk madam on the line.
Silk...
what a coincidence.
We were just talking about you.
I'm here with Vijayan and Surya.
They don't want you
for their next film.
And I think their decision is right.
You won't do this film.
Absolutely not!
On the first day of the shoot...
I would like to
introduce you to my parents.
Hello, Silk ma'am.
I am Mutthu.
I am a small time film maker.
I would to work with you.
This is my card.
Drop it at my place.
Okay, thank you very much.
Excuse me.
Well, the set is beautiful.
Congratulations.
It's all thanks to you.
And don't make a mess today.
My parents will be here soon.
Your mother is fine but...
how old is your father?
Silk, please!
Relax will you!
I'm a hit with the men in your family.
You know... I don't like such jokes.
Ramakant sir...
One second.
Silk madam...
I'm a big fan of yours.
Thank you.
I am Shakeela.
So you're Shakeela!
You've heard about me?
Yes, but it was probably a lie.
Why do you say that?
Do you have a mirror at home?
Break it...
because it's lying that
you can be another Silk.
You are wrong!
I'm sure I have something...
I have the talent.
Is that so?
Come on then!
There is that night of the honeymoon
I am that night
The joy of that night
I am that joy
That knocks the lover senseless
I am that intoxication
The mantra to love and
relationships that you have read
I am that book
I am that book.
I play like the banjo
I blossom in dreams
Gentlemen, make me infamous
I intoxicate you like whiskey
I grapple like a hiccup
Get intoxicated, my gentleman
We forget
ourselves
give me a drink like that
Make the room dark
open your eyes
Whatever is in your heart
whisper it in my
ears through some crowds
Don't worry about the danger
Surpass all the limits
Come forth
don't struggle with me
leave everything to me
Bad
half...sullen...departed
broken, is your dream
without me
It is only me
I am that intoxication
Blend us together
Let her go!
She isn't worthy of you.
Women like Silk
don't belong at home...
a bed is where they belong.
What have you done, Silk?
I had told you... don't think.
You gave up too soon.
Say what you want to!
Couldn't you control
yourself for just one night?
What difference would that make?
Would your parents
think I'm a decent girl?
What is their impression now?
They think you are
lewd and disgusting.
Well, you're in love
with someone like her.
That's my character on screen.
I'm not like that in real life.
You mean you'll stay
like this all your life?
Lewd and disgusting?
The thing that made me Silk...
how can I let it go?
Surya was right...
women like Silk
don't belong at home...
Of course, a bed is
where they belong isn't it!
Silk's noose is ready for both of you.
You call me lewd and disgusting...
see how I ruin you!
What you're
proposing is a very big risk.
Think about it.
When God has blessed
you with one life...
why think twice?
No, think again.
You could lose all
that you have earned.
I never thought I'd
get what I have earned.
You need to do a lot of
films to earn that much.
But only one is enough to lose it all.
It's your blood and sweat...
that's why I'm telling you.
I've seen you rise up...
I can't bear to see you fall.
Silk trusts her Mr. Worm.
I love your idea of a triple role!
One mother and two daughters.
That's what I thought.
When people see one Silk,
their tongues hit the floor.
When they see three Silks together...
their trousers will hit the floor!
Remember Abraham?
What about him? Is he dead?
He is alive.
He is also making a triple role film.
And he is playing the lead.
Ramakant is writing the script.
Mr. Worm...
do you know why Silk is so expensive?
Because it is meant to shine.
Let him make his film.
We will watch it and
so will the public.
The era of hate was over.
Now it was time to
destroy Silk, once and for all.
She stole my idea to
compete against me!
I will put an end to her!
Hello, Mr. Worm...
Good good!
Mr. Worm, will the
trousers come down or not?
Everything will come down.
Your cheque.
Thanks.
You stepped on the beach
and the tide subsided.
When the tide rises...
you will be the first to drown.
I even swam through the
giant waves in a storm...
and that's the reason I've survived.
But you...
you're back to where you started from.
Well, even you've come to me.
You can't live without me.
My biggest fan.
I'm here to celebrate your defeat.
Why?
Don't have anyone to
celebrate your success with?
I had told you...
you can't defeat me.
But the fight was a pleasure.
Silk is born to give pleasure.
To her well-wishers and her opponents.
And you are extra special.
That's what the newspapers say.
But there's something you
still haven't revealed...
the fact that you like me.
Flop actress.
She had the last
word like the lead hero.
I like her?
If she were the last woman on earth...
I'd castrate myself!
Murli...
Murli...
a large coffee, please.
And for the two women?
Beer or tequila?
Success does bestow a
certain energy, Murli.
Two girls?
It's not what you think.
One brought you home last night.
And the other is waiting
outside with her camera.
Ask the one with the camera to wait...
and send the one
from last night packing!
I'm leaving!
Last night was great, wasn't it?
No way!
And you should be with Silk, not me!
All night you kept talking
about that disgusting woman!
Oh, I'm sorry baby.
Tell me something...
when I was talking about her...
was it with hatred or affection?
What?
The problem is I... I hate her...
but she thinks I love her.
I want to know what my
feelings have to say.
You are mad...
absolutely mad!
Bye... I will call you.
Yeah, sure!
You don't even know my name!
Yet you spent the night with me and...
are calling Silk disgusting!
How did I end up in this
Shakespearean tragedy, Silk?
Earlier I fought with you
and now I'm fighting for you!
Your girlfriend left
hurling abuses at you.
She was nothing.
Last week a girl almost broke my head!
Back then you were nothing...
now you are.
Next week again I'll be nothing.
I'm not some film
that changes every week.
You just reminded me of someone.
I imagined I was the only
antique piece around here.
Hey, by the way, congrats.
You've defeated Silk.
I can't believe you guys!
I get no credit for my success.
You're congratulating
me because Silk failed.
Abraham...
whose corner are you in?
Our corner or Silk's corner?
I hate her.
And if you want to
continue talking about her...
then this interview is over!
I didn't know that...
Silk is such a sensitive topic.
Tell me something...
what brought about this
drastic change in your films?
You see... one day I was watching
my own film and I fell asleep.
That's when I realised something.
Films need three things to sell...
entertainment,
entertainment, entertainment!
Silk... anything important?
I have come here to get high.
You know acting always gets me high.
Silk, you know very well that...
neither I nor anybody
else will give you any work.
But if you want some money...
Do you have five rupees?
Five rupees?
When I first tried to get
into films, someone told me...
that nobody would give me any work.
He gave me five
rupees and sent me away.
Sir, give me five rupees.
Probably those days will come back.
I was the dog that...
had gone mad after biting Silk.
I never let a friend
get close to me...
but Silk was, all
thanks to our enmity.
Why did I go to her?
For company?
For lack of a friend,
an enemy would do.
Don't stare at me.
It's as if the oven is
awaiting a marinated chicken!
At least try to give
yourself some respect in your words.
Anyway, what are you doing here?
For lack of a friend,
an enemy will do.
I've destroyed you...
I was here to see how
many stitches Silk needs.
Have a coffee... I'll pay for it.
Two Silk coffees, please.
The coffee that goes by
my name is quite famous.
Try it.
It's the best cure for a hangover.
You will burn in hell!
And you...
you will enjoy it as a
bonfire and warm your hands.
My heart and mind
were caught in a duel.
I guess I was too high
that I began to like Silk.
The mind warned...
‘Don't be an idiot, control yourself.'
For every man there is a woman.
If you can stay away from her,
life will be great.
Otherwise it's over.
I viewed from different angles...
in different poses...
even stood on my head...
but same results.
I can never like you.
You better get yourself checked...
or you won't like your wife
the day after your wedding.
Do you have any alcohol?
Do I look like an idiot?
That I offer you a
drink and let you abuse me?
I want a drink because
I don't want to abuse.
I think you're the type of girl...
who looks better after a drink.
This is the worst!
You mean it struck a
chord in your heart.
The colour of the bathtub is awful...
there should've been more bubbles...
I didn't like it.
Then give it back.
I'm keeping it.
What about this?
Even children wear
more clothes than you.
If you manage to live
up to a ripe old age...
you will look
exactly like your mother.
That's not my mother...
it's me!
Nayla wanted to interview my mother.
You know Nayla...
she can be very persistent.
It was not easy to say 'no' to her...
but it was easy to
become my own mother.
So... I dusted my hair with powder,
wore a dull saree...
and gave the interview.
Have you done anything straight?
Why didn't you take
Nayla to your mother?
My mother had slammed the door on me.
Why would they talk about me...
when they are
embarrassed they gave birth to me.
If you weren't born at all,
how would the world ever know...
that women can also be like you!
Is that an abuse
disguised as praise...
or praise concealed in an abuse?
I can't praise you...
and lately I can't even abuse you.
Be careful, Abraham.
I guess... you're starting to like me.
I told you, you're the type of girl...
who looks better after a drink.
Have you ever been in love?
Love that leads you to bed...
yes.
Love that takes away your breath...
no.
How many people have touched you?
Many have touched me...
but nobody has ever touched my heart.
This is what happens when...
a boy and a girl meet,
they get close...
they kiss... end of story.
I've gained infamy because of that.
But if this story ends
here like this, it will be...
Be what?
It'll be a sin.
Love is a song of the Gods
Love is a festival of
lights for the heart
Love is a fragrance
Love is a burst of morning hues
Love is a lilting waterfall
Love is a prayer
Love exists in every breath
Love lays in the eyes
Separate my heart from my soul
destroy me in love
make my existence
complete with love
To you
I surrender all my love.
My love is an absolute submission.
My love is an absolute submission.
To you
I surrender all my love.
My love is an absolute submission.
My love is an absolute submission.
Love is a song of the Gods
Love is a festival of
lights for the heart
Love is a fragrance
Love is a burst of morning hues
I think of you in the morning
I think of you at dawn
My destiny
holds only your name
In your fire I burn
playing with the coal
In my dreams, I walk ahead
to tell you...
To you
I surrender all my love
My love is an absolute submission
My love is an absolute submission
To you
I surrender all my love
My love is an absolute submission.
My love is an absolute submission.
Walking together
our hands leave each others' grasp
Don't meet me in such paths
Talking
the night fades away
Meet me in those nights
Who am 1?
Who is God?
Where you are
I find everything
Our lips meet
my lips blossom
Why should I move away?
To you
I surrender all my love.
My love is an absolute submission.
My love is an absolute submission.
To you
I surrender all my love.
My love is an absolute submission.
My love is an absolute submission.
I'm sober, and yet
you're still beautiful.
Nothing else could be
worse than this, Silk.
Even your enemy
doesn't hate you anymore.
Hello?
Silk.
Who is it?
Who is there?
Who is it you want?
Ask, ‘what do you want?'
My money. All of it!
I told you I will give it back...
I'm not going anywhere.
You have my house as collateral.
Listen, madam!
As soon as I sign my next film,
I will return everything.
I saw your last film
and the empty theatres.
You think anybody
will offer you a film?
You have until next week...
or you can forget the house.
I had no idea that Silk
was so badly shattered.
She herself didn't
know what was she up to.
Oh great, you are here.
Come...
I've been waiting for you.
Come in...
Everything is ready for you.
Everything.
What do you mean ready?
What's the story?
Script... dialogues?
Story... sexy.
Dialogue... sexy.
Expression... sexy.
Madam, from your head to your toe,
you should only exude sex.
- What are you thinking about?
-l don't... I don't get it...
what's going on?
Don't worry.
I don't think I can do it.
Listen to me, please.
Don't be scared of them.
They are all junior artists.
But you are different.
They are rehearsing.
Come with me.
Have a seat.
I'll explain it to you.
We will do exactly as you say.
Don't worry at all.
Just a minute.
Listen madam...
right now I have a film...
and money.
It's yours, keep it.
Madam, right now you
don't have either of them.
What are you worried about?
Do it.
Trust me, just do it.
I suggest you have a drink.
Relax... then think about it.
No problem at all.
Drink!
Madam...
you make one film with me and I
will plant a garden of money for you.
And then, both money
and films will chase you!
Here take this...
don't think, just take it. Come on!
Good.
Madam, we're ready for your shot.
Come!
Good. Good Silk.
Make it sexy.
Police police...
You are Silk, right?
Hey, madam.
Why don't you freshen up...
If you need anything,
he will help you.
This way, madam.
Please.
Come on, Silk... pick up.
I have such a big
surprise for you... answer!
I haven't been able to talk to Silk.
I guess she's not at home.
Okay.
There's something I
need to do right now...
so, tomorrow I'll take you there.
Alright.
Okay.
‘Congrats! What a film!
Brilliant acting!""
Everybody had words of praise.
The buttons of my shirt gave way...
my chest was so puffed up with pride!
Then what was I missing?
I was at the party...
but my thoughts were elsewhere...
Silk...
Silk... Silk... Silk...
Her name kept ringing in my mind.
But she...
she wasn't even answering her phone!
Hello?
- There's something strange about you.
When I ignored you, I
bumped into you everywhere.
Now when I want to see you...
you decide to vanish.
Abraham, do yourself a favour.
Find yourself someone nice.
Listen...
I have a big surprise for you.
You want to sign me for your film?
Even better.
I'm waiting.
Right now...
I'm stuck at a boring
party with boring people.
Who is there?
The usual suspects.
Suryakant, Ramakant,
Venkat, Vijayan, Selva Ganesh...
Tell them I've said ‘bye'.
Where are you going?
To bed.
I'm very sleepy.
See you in the morning.
Promise. I'll see you.
Abraham sir...
it's your party.
We were looking for you.
You just vanished.
Where were you?
I was talking to Silk.
The bus isn't moving, then
why are you running after it?
She's worthless.
You can talk to her anytime.
Enjoy the party.
What did she have to say?
She said bye to all of you.
Is she going somewhere?
It's the right thing to do, Ramakant.
She should go away.
There's nothing left for her anymore.
Silk!
Silk!
Silk!
Silk!
When life becomes miserable,
that's when you begin to understand it.
And a million questions arise to
which you will never get the answers.
Why didn't mother hug me as
soon as she opened the door?
Why didn't I realise that...
worshipping a star and loving a
star are two different things.
The person whom you taught
to stand up for himself...
why didn't he stand up for you?
Everybody wanted to feel me,
why didn't anybody hold my hand?
You can hear the
pages turn in a library.
You can even hear
honking in a 'silence' zone.
But when ears that are accustomed to
applause fail to hear the abuses...
life begins to
resemble an empty theatre.
I don't know whether
Silk was right or wrong?
The matters in a person's
life runs for really long.
But the judgments are passed up there.
Up there.
Silk must be creating an
uproar up there as well.

Ila (Nimrat Kaur) is a young housewife seeking the attention of her husband, Rajeev (Nakul Vaid), and searching for ways to bring the romance back into her marriage; one of her ideas is to cook delicious lunches for him. Through a rare mix-up of the dabbawalas (a complicated food delivery system in Mumbai that picks up and delivers lunches from restaurants or homes to people at work), the tiffin carrier (lunchbox) Ila prepares for her husband gets accidentally delivered, instead, to Saajan Fernandes (Irrfan Khan), a middle-aged widower who is about to retire from his job of an accountant. Ila eventually realises the mistake and with the advice of her neighbour aunt, Mrs. Deshpande (Bharti Achrekar - voice only), living in the apartment above her, writes a letter to Saajan about the mix-up and places it in the lunchbox (along with her husband's favourite meal) the next day. An exchange of letters sent back and forth with the lunches ignites a friendship between the two, as they share memories and events from their own lives.

At work, Saajan is tasked with training his replacement, Aslam Shaikh (Nawazuddin Siddiqui). Socially distant after his wife's death, Saajan is initially reluctant to interact with Shaikh and train him. After Shaikh reveals that he is an orphan who taught himself accounting, Saajan gradually warms up to him, and eventually the duo strike a close friendship. At one point, Saajan saves Shaikh's job by covering for his blatant mistakes and becomes the best man at his marriage with Mehrunissa (Shruti Bapna). Meanwhile, Ila discovers that Rajeev is having an extramarital affair and gives up hope of rekindling her marriage. In one of the lunchbox letters, she suggests moving to Bhutan where the cost of living is much cheaper than India. Saajan writes back with the suggestion that the two move there together. Ila then offers to meet in person at a popular restaurant but at the appointed time, Saajan does not show up. Upon receiving an empty lunchbox in disappointment the next day, Saajan writes back to the dejected Ila and apologises to her, stating that he did arrive and watched her from a distance, but could not approach her. He explains how young and beautiful she looked, while surmising that he is too old for her and advising her to move on.

Some time later, Ila's father, battling lung cancer, dies in the care of her mother (Lillete Dubey), who confesses how unhappy her marriage was. She gives Ila the advice “Sometimes, the wrong train takes us to the right station”. Ila receives the address of Saajan's office from the dabbawalas only to learn from Shaikh that he has already retired and headed to Nashik. She writes a farewell message to Saajan announcing that she has decided to leave Rajeev and move to Bhutan with her young daughter, Yashvi. Meanwhile, Saajan changes his mind en route to Nashik and returns to Mumbai. The film ends with Ila waiting for Yashvi to return from school and Saajan heading to her house with the dabbawalas who regularly picked up and delivered the eponymous lunchbox.",3071,NA,NA,NA

Any resemblance to real persons,

Tell me, who is driving our country?
- The country?
It is not a vehicle
for someone to drive it.
And where will they drive it to?
Outside the earth?
Our country will
remain where it was..
..and it will remain there forever.
I agree. You are right.
That's why you are
able to fool everyone..
..since so many years.
The country means system
which everyone curses.
You and me. And this system
has made us enemies of each other.
Cheers.
You are referring
to the powerful foxes.
That's where you lost it.
The one who are holding
high positions..
..are not running the country.
What we can see is all an act.
Democracy.
The real thing goes
on behind the scenes.
Excuse me.
- What?
Do you have a light?
- Light.
Here is a lighter.
- I also want a cigarette.
All my smokes are over.
Who is calling me so late at night?
Okay. You can leave now.
- Yes.
Go.
- Yes, tell me.
So where we?
Behind the scenes.
- Yes.
Gandhi said that Pandit Nehru..
..wanted to be the Prime Minister.
The country agreed.
And Pandit Nehru became
the Prime Minister the next day.
Now tell me what political
power supported Pandit.
Tell me.
Gandhi was the Mahatma.
Mahatma has their own powers.
They are driving this nation.
Mahatma Gandhi?
Look at this. Isn't he?
Boy, get a packet of cigarettes.
You are drinking so slowly.
Have a neat.
Run.
Policemen feed you for
free on only two instances.
One when he is afraid
of losing his job.
And second when he is expecting
a medal from the government.
What are you going
to get that today..
..you are treating me
to free wisdom and alcohol?
Today is good Friday. Our festival.
So I thought I would sit with you.
Enjoy a little.
Pray to Jesus Christ.
Have Pehelwan hanged.
So you have changed colors.
As soon as the power equations changed,
you changed colour like a chameleon.
You didn't recognize
the government Pehelwan.
How would you recognize me?
Yes, I have been
trapped today because..
..I didn't understand you.
Look Jacob,
no police station in this country..
..has got my photo nor
do I have any case against me.
Once Bhanumati returns
to power I will get clean chit.
But what will happen to you?
You neither have
a Mahatma nor a Gandhi.
You will go directly inside.
Don't scare me.
You have become too serious.
I have drank so much alcohol..
..that I might pee in my pants.
Don't scare me. Let's go and pee.
You have taken it seriously.
I am just kidding. Come. Come on.
What are you doing? Come. Come.
How far are we going?
Do you want to pee
in front of the tiger?
Why are you glaring at
me like this? You can pee now.
I know your men
are around somewhere.
I won't run away.
- You are very smart.
You haven't understood yet.
I have got you here
to kill you in an encounter.
I told you that only
Mahatma and Gandhi..
..running the nation.
Mahatma is the one who
have no evidence of their crimes.
Who ordered me to be killed, Jacob?
The same Mahatma to whose
crime you bear witness.
You have to die so that he
can have a clean chit, Pehelwan.
Don't speak in riddles.
Tell me clearly.
Tell me, who is behind this?
Bhanumati.
You are going to
die on a good today.
Today is the day Jesus
Christ had given his blood..
..to pay for our sins.
God might forgive you today.
You have honored me
a lot by bringing the..
..entire army to kill
this unarmed Pehelwan.
Give me one more favor.
Turn around.
I need to pee hard.
Go ahead.
Jacob.
- Yes.
How can your God
forgive anyone today?
His son was crucified today?
If you call this
Friday good Friday then...
You are about to die.
You can ask Him yourself.
Tell me which hell
would you prefer?
Of Hindus,
Christians, Muslims or the Jews.

(Water Waves Sound)
Sir, he is done for.
- Pehelwan is no more.
Shall we?
Hey. Who is it? Greetings Baba.
We have arranged for
your bathing in Ghat No. 2.
Take a left turn from ahead.
This way, go ahead.
You monkey.
Are you in a hurry to meet God?
You misunderstand. I am Damroo.
Damroo. Damroo.
Sir. What happened? Sir.
Sir.
(Door Opens)
What happened, friend?
Are you okay?
Damroo. Where is Damroo?
- Who is Damroo, friend?
Mouney Baba found you injured.
He brought you here.
Have some offerings.
Mouney Baba?
Very powerful Baba. Mouney Baba.
He has surrendered
his voice to God.
He is always silent.
Take his blessings and let's leave.
Greetings, Baba. Greetings, Baba.
Sir, I have been in this
profession for the last 1.5 years.
And now I know that no
business is better than religion.
And such respect.
Great leaders, kings,
CM, PM, everyone touches your feet.
Bhanumati's cronies are
looking for me everywhere.
And you are spreading
knowledge here.
Just tell me,
where should we run away from here?
Shall I cross the border to
Pakistan, Bangladesh or Sri Lanka?
You don't need to go anywhere now.
You have reached your destination.
In the temple of religion.
Everything can change here.
You can change too.
Even the police, CID, etc.
can't find anyone here? Nothing.
Bhanumati is insignificant in
front of all this. - (Birds Chirping)
Just take of this garb
and surrender to River Ganga.
We will start a new game
at an international level.
You want me to turn
to an ascetic like you.
Sir, not an ascetic. I said Baba.
I can't do anything
since my speech is impaired.
Otherwise I would have gone places.
You haven't done anything
but abuse and get abused.
And now you want to tell
people about the scriptures.
No one has time to
listen to scriptures.
Baba means who takes money..
..and shows the shortcut to heaven.
And enough money to even
give loans to Swiss banks.
Stay like kings.
Just watch. Listen to me.
Say goodbye to the past
and turn over a new leaf.
(Birds Chirping)
Sir is giving up his body.
Keep it.
I am renouncing everything.
Are you going to
give me everything?
Don't stop.
Just give everything away.
Even your chain.

Very good.
Hail Mahadev. Hail Babaji.

Sir, it seems like a small place.
But it is gold.
There is a lot of property.
It's a city of black marketers!
Kabirganj.
What they say?
Cottage industries. Handicrafts.
Everything is exported.
So they earn in dollars.
Goodness.
Do you remember the Dhuliya?
He has his own bank here.
We need to join hands with him.
What is this?
You said that there is
no shop for religion here?
Sir, I was about to tell
you about it. It's nothing.
Look at the name below.
Bholanath Tripathi, Former MLC.
He is just a former politician.
Nothing else.
He used to do perform
protests in villages here.
Now he doesn't bother
about money etc.
People respect him somewhat.
We will take over his
shop and start our business.
Sir, I know.
We have come here in
a public bus without a ticket.
And we will leave
from here in an airplane.
Sir, I want to ask you
something I was thinking about.
What is your real name?
So aren't you going
to give yourself a name?
Everyone has one.
Do you want a name or not?
My name is Damroo.
A dream of a glorious India.
A dream of a beautiful India.
It is the rule of nature
that as you sow so shall you reap.
The India of the future.
So teach them good things
today so that our future..
..and the future of
the country is secured.
Right, Mr. Agarwal? What happened?
I am very troubled, Pandit.
- What happened?
It seems someone has
cast an evil eye on my health.
What did the doctor say?
First I tested positive
for high sugar.
And the BP and now
because of cholesterol..
..I have been asked
to do a bypass surgery.
My wife is saying
that surely someone..
..has done hoodoo on my health.
That mean some has cast an evil eye.
- Yes.
You are a great man.
Please cure me of this.
Manku, forget the tea.
Go inside and get the ashes
from the incense that is burning.
And rub it on his pajamas.
(Laughing)
What are you saying?
- What else should I say?
Mr. Agarwal I have told
you several times to perform yoga.
Exercise a little.
You will eat fried fish,
chicken etc.
How would that do?
Your wife says that
some has cast an evil eye.
Manku, take off the pajamas..
..maybe you will
get rid of the evil eye.
Go and do yoga, Mr. Agarwal.
I am not joking.
What will you do with the body?
Go and do some Yoga there.
Pandit, tell us what should
I do with the doors and windows...
What happened? Have they got termites?
- No.
Nothing is safe in the house..
..where we were
able find everything.
Theft is increasing.
Pandit, I took a loan from
the bank to open a factory.
I lost everything overnight.
- The police....
The police does nothing, Pandit.
They have now 14 police
stations instead of 4.
But what's the use?
There is an old saying.
A hut of smart men in
the neighborhood of fools.
How can we act wise in this world?
One minute. One minute. One minute.
What happened?
- I need your blessings.
I have come from far away.
I had come to take your blessing.
I am leaving now.
It's okay.
Where are you from?
Nowhere? I had travelled
a 1000 miles on foot. - Okay.
Tell me.
- Yes.
These innocent people.
- Yes.
They come here with their problems.
- Of course.
And you are making fun of them.
I am not making fun of them.
You are talking
indecently with them.
I had come from far
away to be taught by you.
But you have opened my eyes.
Look, sir. I name is Bhola Pandit.
Do you understand?
I am not Baba Ramdev
for you to come from far away.
So sorry.
- No, you can't be like Ramdev.
You can't even be his assistant.
That is too much, bro.
- Listen. Don't shout.
Calm down.
He has got the right to speak.
I don't want to say anything.
You can go your way.
I have found the real one
in my search of the fake.
If I had not come here than
I wouldn't even met Global Baba.
Who?
Global Baba.
Globe. The earth.
Globe.
- And it's Global.
Global Baba.
- Okay, Global Baba.
Who is he?
- That was the name he gave me.
Last night at Kabirganj.
And I saw that my neck was hurt.
What happened?
The thieves of Kabirganj stole it.
- What?
This on and then some
came and said that..
..Global Baba has come here.
He is taking rest there.
In Kabirganj.
- Yes, in Kabirganj.
A 6 feet man was lying like this.
A cobra was at his head.
Cobra?
- Yes.
King cobra.
- King cobra?
I became nervous.
I was not even able to speak.
Baba suddenly opened his
eyes and asked what happened?
I said I have been robbed.
He concentrated and told me
the address right away.
What is his name?
- Global Baba.
Yes, Global Baba.
- In Kabirganj.
Yes, in Kabirganj. He is sitting
there. 10 minutes away from here.
He is an atom bomb.
You are just a cracker.
Forgive me. I am leaving.
Oh no.
- Sorry. Get away.
Brother. Brother, stop.
Don't you dare follow me.
The true finds the truth.
And the false finds falsehoods.
You deserve him. Bye.
- Brother listen.
Please take us to Global baba.
Don't bother me.
Don't bother me.
That man there. He is your savior.
He will help you.
Don't follow me, rascals. Go away.
Brother, listen to me.
Go away. Don't follow me.
Where are you going?
- Listen to me.
Where is Baba?
Baba.
- That is not him.
Go away. Go.
Because of you I lost
such a great person.
Brother! Come here. Here.
Is that him?
- Yes, he is Global baba.
He is Global Baba.
- But this tiger.
When I met him this
tiger was not with him.
How did a tiger
came in to Kabirganj?
I don't know.
He is playing with
the tiger like a pet dog.
Move. Move. Baba.
- Do you want us to die?
Why are you disturbing him?
If he became angry and
let the tiger loose on us..
..then all of us
will be in trouble.
Move. Baba.
Hey, run!
You. Get up.
Get up. Child, What are you doing?
That's enough.
Get up. What happened?
Did you find your lost property?
Baba, I found it.
Baba, you are great.
Baba, I thought I have missed you.
Baba, that tiger?
That tiger was my old landlord.
- Landlord?
Yes. I had done penance
for years in his cave.
In the mountains of Prayagraj.
The poor thing didn't even take any money.
- Wow.
Since I left without informing
him he became worried.
By the way even you
had gone to meet your Guru.
What happened?
Sir, I met him what can I say?
He is nothing compared to you.
Please accept me as your disciple,
Baba. Please.
What will you do with me, child?
I have got no house or address.
There are many famous
ascetics in this world..
..with their own
temples and hermitages.
Go and join one of them.
- No Baba.
I don't want to join any one.
All are thieves.
Don't deny me.
You are the powerhouse of miracles.
All else are burnt out bulbs.
Save me.
Take me at your feet.
- Baba. Baba. Baba.
All right. I will help you all.
I have taken rest in your city.
So I am indebted to you.
Just tell me your
problems one by one.
I will forward all your
requests to the global godfather.
The rest is all on Him.
- Global godfather?
Shut up.
- Baba.
Baba, save me.
- You get up.
Baba, he is a genuine man.
Listen to his problem.
Baba.
You are leaving a
government building..
..with a packet in your hand.
You are right, Baba.
That's the bank.
It happened last week.
It contains your lifelong dream.
Yes, Baba. I took a loan
of 12 lakhs from the bank.
It was robbed. I am ruined, Baba.
I am ruined. Help me.
A building under construction.
A shop behind.
A pile of sand and a tree.
What does that mean, sir?
This is how Baba offers solutions.
When I lost my locket he said poop,
vegetable, funnel cake.
I found it in the toilet
behind the funnel cake shop..
..in the vegetable market.
- Yes.
A building under construction.
A shop behind.
A pile of sand and a tree.
What does that mean?
- Listen. Listen.
What?
- Mr. Chaubey's shop.
Yes.
- A building is being constructed there.
Yes. - It also has a pile of sand
and also a tree.
Then what are we waiting for?
Let's go.

friendship nor enmity.""

Look how much we have
got in our first offerings.
Sir, what are you showing me?
You have returned the stuff
stolen with such difficulty.
We would had had good
food with that money.
Not you but the priest
who would come to perform..
..your funeral would
have had good food.
The protection of this
entire area has been destroyed.
Global bad spirits are eyeing it.
It is not possible to stop
the thieving going on here.
Baba, don't say so.
Baba, don't say so.
You are our last hope, baba.
Please give us a solution, Baba.
The one who wants
a protection amulet..
..will have to give
one tenth of his income..
..to the global godfather.
This is our global godfather.
""He created such an illusion
with crocodile tears.""
""This is where the
Baba will operate from.""
""With the blessings
of the global godfather..
..every house will
see a globalized morning.""

Take water from the bottom
of the river every morning.
And you will have to pour
it on the top of the mountain.
And don't you dare stop.
Don't stop.
And what will you
say on your way there?
Global Baba.
- Mr. Agarwal.

Baba you are great.
You have cured my husband.
You did what even
medicine couldn't do.
Say, Hail Global Baba.
Open your eyes Mr. DM.
This is government land.
Government land. Forest land.
As per the Indian
constitution this land..
..is preserved for them. For them.
The one who is fighting
for their lives and hunger.
They are fighting
for their existence..
..in your so called moral society.
Because Babas and dacoits
have taken over their land..
..with help from the
police and the system.
Do you have any answer for them?
Tell me.
Pandit, I did send
my officers here 2-3 times.
They have been said that this..
..is a temporary religious camp.
And it will be taken down soon.
What are you saying Mr. DM.
You are talking like a blind man.
Do you think this is temporary?
This is a permanent
slap on your secularism.
The paper he is holding
looks more temporary than this.
Whereas law says that
this land belongs to them.
Whom should we complain to?
Who will protect them?
The police who are
pandering to the Baba.
Answer them not me.
Pandit, I will send them
an evacuation notice soon.
And have them leave
this place soon.
He will send them notice.
The same rigmarole.
Government work will go on.
You sent notices and they
will put stay order on it.
You will file a case
against that stay order.
And they will file a
harassment case against you.
And this is how time will fly.
What will happen to him?
He will die soon while
waiting for his justice.
Forget him. He has lived his life.
This is Tulsi.
She has born in India,
the best place in the world.
Her protectors have
made her future bleak.
Dear, say hello to uncle.
You can go and pander to the Baba.
You are the DM now.
Soon you will become
home secretary.
What about her?
She has taken birth to die.
Come. They will issue a stay order.
Let's go.
What are you doing Gupta?
Changing the name
of the shop, Pandit.
Does your global father
only have fathers?
Does he have any mother too?
He only has a father, priest.
He is from a different
planet where..
..they have no mother.
Just fathers.
Pandit, you are insulting Baba.
I am quite because I respect you.
Others would have
retaliated accordingly.
Why are you respecting me?
When you can change
the name of your shop from..
..Hanuman Juice center
to the name of a thief..
..who has stolen government land..
..then you can retaliate openly.
Your society is strange.
Beware Pandit.
Don't you dare say anything
against Global baba.
(Crowd Chattering)
""If anyone tries to attack Baba.""
""Even the government is shaken.""
""The one who messes with
religion is gone forever.""
""Everything is finished
at just one call.""
""The saffron robes weigh
heavy on the khaki uniform.""
""The time of Baba is bigger
than the time of royalty.""
""The time of Baba is bigger
than the time of royalty.""
It is very shocking that
the most peaceful district of..
..the country Kabirganj
has become a center of riots.
The state government
has taken strict steps..
..and have transferred
the DM of Kabirganj..
..along with half a
dozen other high officials.
And has announced that they will..
..find out the cause of the riots.
We have with us PC Jacob,
the new police chief of Kabirganj.
Bhavna. Bhavna. My battery is over.
Sorry. Sorry.
I will just get it. Just a moment.
What kind of cartoons
I have to deal with it.
Sorry, Mr. Jacob. Just 2 minutes.
Why are you saying sorry?
Actually I should be thanking you.
This was my first interview
and I was nervous.
Thank you.
Mr. Jacob, how will you
control the situation here..
..if you are so nervous?
The situation is already
under control, madam.
The little tension that
you see here will be over..
..after the home
minister's visit tomorrow.
Just take care of
your battery's charge.
The police force here
is charged up already.
Nice meeting you.
- Same here.
We swear on Global Baba.
The hermitage won't be moved.
We swear on Global Baba.
The hermitage won't be moved.
We swear on Global Baba.
The hermitage won't be moved.
I apologise to all.
I have come to meet the people..
..who have been effected
by the riots right now.
Please come with your
questions to my residence.
I will answer them.
The minister.
- Hail him.
The minister.
- Hail him.
How is your son?
Can't you see what
is wrong with my son?
Why are you all so angry with me?
I am worried about
the peace of the state..
..and the security of you people.
Is this how you are going
to ensure our security?
Entire Kabirganj is robbed.
You have ruined it.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Global baba.
- Hail him.

Greetings Baba.
My brother has lost his arm.
He might have even lost his head.
But your hermitage
should be protected, Baba.
Your hermitage
shouldn't break, Baba.
It won't. You all are there.
We swear on Global Baba.
The hermitage won't be moved.
We swear on Global Baba.
The hermitage won't be moved.
We swear on Global Baba.
The hermitage won't be moved.
We swear on Global Baba.
The hermitage won't be moved.
There is the Baba.
- Come on.
We swear on Global Baba.
- You don't worry.
The hermitage won't be moved.
- Situation is under control.
Police is trying...
The people want to
know who is behind this.
Baba. Greetings. Remember me?
We met at Allahabad during Kumbh.
I also did a segment on you.
Oh yes. How are you?
I am fine. But your voice.
What?
You were Mouney baba right?
I was Mouney baba.
But Global Baba cured my voice.
It was miraculous.
Then why didn't he perform
the miracle completely?
I mean he could have
made you speak clear.
Why are you speaking with a slur?
You don't understand.
My body is 35 years old.
But my voice is only 4 months old.
So it is going to be slurry.
What are you doing?
Baba, I was just
checking my lenses.
Listen. Come to the ashram.
And we will talk.
All right. Take care.
I will also make your life good.
Bye. Take care.
(Laughing)
Jokes aside, Pandit.
Don't you think the
issue of the hermitage..
..on Adivasi land a
little tricky and sensitive?
Yes, it is tricky.
Then is it okay
to leave such issues..
..on such emotional people?
What do you want to say?
I mean the sensible
people of Kabirganj..
..should come together on this.
Otherwise it can
blow out of proportion.
The sensible people of Kabirganj.
Who are they?
Sensible people like
you and the ones..
..who follow your ideologies.
Who follows my ideologies?
Dallu Yadav?
Just tell me that you
have got a proposal from him.
You work in his channel
so hail Dallu Yadav.
It is not like that, Pandit.
You know me.
I accept that Dallu
asked me to talk to you but...
What did he tell you?
He must have told you
that Bhavna go and request him.
Tell him to support
me in politics and win..
..so that he can betray me again.
Hello, Pandit.
- Hello.
I am the new city SP here.
My name is Jacob.
Welcome. Welcome. Please sit.
- Hello.
This is Bhavna Sharma. My child.
Yes, I have met you.
You are a journalist.
The batteries are charged, madam.
(Laughing)
What batteries
are you referring to?
Is see that your batteries
are charged, Jacob.
Have you got my arrest warrant?
Arrest warrant for you?
Why, Pandit?
I was the main reason
of those riots.
I forced the DM to break
the wall of the hermitage.
Well than I must thank you, Pandit.
Kabirganj has turned into hell
and you are thanking me.
No, Pandit.
Actually I have got promoted
because of your riots.
No, I haven't had you promoted.
You got promoted because
of your name. Jacob.
Jacob, consider this promotion..
..to be a gift from Jesus Christ.
Because the Adivasi
people worship them.
Her great boss Dallu Yadav
is going to play..
..the Adivasi card
this time in elections.
Look, he has even called you here.
I have heard that even
the new DM is an Adivasi.
Move. We won't open the gate.
Do you know who is he?
- Who?
He is the home minister of state.
He is not even stopped abroad and..
..you are stopping him
in his own state.
Look, sir.
I don't know about all that.
This is Global Baba's Ashram.
And here only he reigns supreme.
If you want to come in then
queue up otherwise you can return.
Listen. Listen. Listen to me.
- Go, Go away.
(Door Opens)
Global baba.
- Hello. - Hello.
(Door Closes)
Uncle, he is asking us to queue up.
Come, sir. Come ahead of us.
- All right.
Come on. Move on.
- Hello, Baba.
Come on.
Go and take the offerings
from there. Move on.
Just think about what you want.
The lord will understand everything.
He can read people's minds.
Come on.
Move from here.
Hey, send the women there.
Hello, Baba.
He was born because
of your blessings.
Bless him.
- Come.
Ladies go there.
Sir, go there.
This queue is for ladies.
One minute. One minute.
I don't have any problem
to sit with the crowd.
I know that you have more
influence in my area than me.
No problem if you want to
make me realize this repeatedly.
Otherwise can we talk
alone for two minutes?
Yes, Mr. Minister.
What do you want from this beggar?
I have heard that you
can read a person's mind.
Now tell me my problem
and its solution?
Actually you can avail
20% Adivasi vote only..
..if the 80% majority
vote is divided.
Not if they are divided
under one name?
What do you mean?
I mean the minority ticket
won't work this time..
..because Baba has
united the majority.
The rest you have to decide
if you want to send the..
..documents of this land
of this hermitage or bulldozers.
Come on. Touch my feet.
- What?
The tradition of
the hermitage is that..
..once the meeting is over
the visitor touches my feet.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Now I have a request for you too.
A government team
will come to survey..
..the land of the hermitage.
Please ask your devotees to enter.
You know that no one gives
security amulets without fanfare.
Neither global godfather
nor the government. Bye.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Jacob, you might find it strange.
You come here after passing
difficult IAS-IPS examinations.
And then you have take orders
from these ignorant politicians.
You are underestimating
our democracy, madam.
The way everyone cannot
become IAS or IPS.
In the same way everyone
cannot be a politician either.
And the one whom you
are calling ignorant used to..
..fight for the common man while..
..we were studying for our exams.
So everyone is there because
they are fit to be there.
Why have you become so serious?
No, I am never serious.
I was just thinking
that something is surely..
..special about this
Global baba to have..
..so many followers so soon.
He used to be a criminal, who
was killed in a police encounter.
He would have looked like
this Baba if he was still alive.
What?
Don't misquote me.
No breaking news please.
The city has calmed down
after a long time.
Please allow it to
remain calm. Please.
Come Jacob.
Let's go and meet this Baba once.
Madam, we are bound by some rules.
To stay away from media,
rich people and Babas.
Yes.
- Nice meeting you again.
Same here.
- Bye. Bye.
Bye.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Sorry, sorry.
- Global baba. - Hail him.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Baba, the children for
whom I have given up everything..
..gives me my food today
as if I am bitch at their doorstep.
Baba, you are only one my support.
- Madam, go ahead. Go ahead. Done.
Bless me baba.
- Go ahead.
Go ahead. Go ahead. From here. Go.
Baba, my father sold everything
to make me an engineer.
How can I tell him
that I have failed, Baba?
He will die, Baba.
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
Come. Come.
Baba, listen to her problem.
Baba, I am sick of life.
I have been married for
7 years but I am still childless.
My in-laws abuse me as infertile.
Leave me.
- Manu.
What are you doing? Get up.
Pay the rent first,
then you'll get the car keys.
Father, are you okay?
When you will give
us the remaining rent?
Come. Come. Go ahead.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Baba, today someone
told me that everyone is..
..there in their position
because they deserve to be there.
Take her away.
Since then I am thinking,
where am I baba?
I am nowhere, Baba.
I never reached the
place where I wanted to be.
I sold my dreams
for just 17,500, Baba.
Just for 17,500. House rent.
Expenses for father's medicines.
I wanted to study
further but I couldn't.
Is it my mistake?
I wanted to fight my fate.
But I couldn't.
Is it my mistake?
Baba, I wish I could show
people what I am capable of.
(Crying)
I wish, baba.
(Crying)
Sir, listen to me.
She is a journalist.
She might be useful to us.
(Crying)
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Bhavna. Hello?
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Bhavna.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Bhavna. Where are you going?
I need to leave, Baba.
- What happened?
Who have wronged you?
No, Baba. Please let me leave.
I won't let you go.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
I told you I will
make your life better.
Global Baba wants to meet you. Come.
- No, Baba.
Hello, Baba.
- Yes, disciple.
Baba has called her.
Baba has called her himself.
Come on.
No.
- Come.
Come on. Meet the Baba first.
Hail global Baba.
Come.
Come this way.
(Door Opens)
Baba has called her. Go ahead.
(Door Closes)
You can sit wherever
you want, girl.
I am sorry, Baba.
I became too emotional.
You must think that
I am sad and poor.
But it is nothing like that.
The atmosphere was such.
Everyone was sharing their
grief so even I was overwhelmed.
You must have seen a few
foreigners amongst my devotees.
And soon their number will grow.
Please sit. Sit.
I want someone who can
convey my message to them.
And convey their messages to me.
I think you have knowledge
of foreign languages.
Yes.
My devotees outside Kabirganj..
..want to keep in contact
with me at all times.
I have thought to start
a TV channel at their insistence.
What do you think?
It's good.
Will you be able
to manage my channel?
What?
You will be paid
3 lakhs a month from..
..the hermitage for this work.
What? Me?
- Yes.
Think about it.
If you like my proposal
than come and meet Baba Damroo.
Hail Global Godfather.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Baba, some government
people have come.
Open the gates. Let them come.
- Okay.
(Door Opens)
You will have to deposit
your mobiles, guns, etc. here.
Done.
Yes, done.
- Baba.
I have given them
the Global medicine.
Is it good?
- Yes.
Everything will be fine.
You will become pregnant.
One more.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Global baba.
- Hail him.
Walk properly.
What is your name?
Sumitra.
No. It's Gopi.
And I am the one
who plays the flute.
(Conch Shell Blowing)
Hail India, sir.
This is mine.
- And this is mine.
Don't feel embarrassed.
- You are the one feeling shy.
Play fearlessly.
I am master in such game.
- Look. Look at this. Look at this.
Sir, you?
- Hail India, sir.
Sir, hello.
- Sir please sit.
Tea. Tea.
- Oh no.
Mahender, get some tea.
No, nothing.
- Sir, please sit.
Come.
It is an emergency.
- What happened sir?
I have to discuss
something important.
Sir, please tell us.
Do you remember
Chillum Pehelwan whom..
..we had killed in an encounter?
- Yes.
Who identified his body?
- Sir.
We two went to Baliya
and identified his body.
Go and clean there.
Go and play there. Go out. Out.
- Yes.
Are you sure it was Pehelwan's body?
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.
He was wearing our handcuffs?
Chain. Bracelets. Rings.
Everything belonged to him.
We couldn't make out his face, sir.
I mean the fishes
had eaten his eyes, etc.
We found out that it is
corpse because of the handcuffs.
And it reached Baliya
through the river Ganga.
'The stiff was his but
the body was someone else's.'
Manu.
No, papa. It's me.
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep.
(Coughing)
Give it to me.
It decreases tension, right?
Let me try it too. Give.
- What are you doing? Leave it.
I have left it.
This is just... Since morning...
You haven't gone home yet.
This is also our home.
We spend half of the month here.
If papa was operated
on time then ..
..neither we nor he would
have been inconvenienced.
Listen.
- Yes.
I have got a huge offer today.
But the people seem
to be very shady.
What? What is the offer?
3 lakhs a month.
What?
- 3 lakhs.
What are you staring at?
It's working for the channel.
Nothing else.
They can employ Barkha Dutt
or someone..
..equivalent to her in this amount.
Why are they paying
you 3 lakh rupees?
What do you mean?
What do you mean by that?
I mean..
If I had not shouldered
your responsibility..
..then even I would
have Barkha Dutt today.
(Coughing)
Too much.
- Bhavna, I didn't mean to say that.
I mean to say that if they
are shady then join their gang.
And have your doubts
clarified and be Barkha Dutt.
I am there with you.
Have I ever refused you anything?
Hail India, sir.
- Hail India.
(Door Closes)
Put up in my office.
- Sir.
Have a seat. Have a seat.
Thank you sir.
What happened? Any emergency Jacob?
Sir, I want say
something about Baba...
Start discussing stiff with
the offerings from Global Baba.
Take this. You too.
- Thank you.
And this is the protective
amulet from Global Baba.
Keep it with you.
It will always protect you.
Ghanshyam.
- So what were you saying, Jacob?
I was feeling unwell since
night so I was thinking..
..if I should take medicines
or these blessings from Baba.
That's it.
- Look.
In our country we require
both medicines and prayers.
You are right, sir.
Cancel all meetings.
We will do it tomorrow.
But Baba only takes 3-4...
- No problem.
Try to understand. He is a man.
With politics he also
needs something physical...
Hello, sir.
- Bhavna, what am I hearing?
Are you resigning?
- I am forced sir.
I have told you before
that my salary is not enough.
And I said that earn
commissions from ads.
Sir, I am a reporter.
My work is to get news not ads.
Bhavna, elections are approaching.
Such talks don't suit you.
Think about PR.
How would be my PR
like in the elections?
Okay? Bye.
Where were you SP?
- Some old case.
Hello.
- Okay.
Yes, hello. How are you? Hi.
- Hi.
Don't greet her, sir.
- Why?
She is our new sister-in-law.
What?
- Yes.
Good morning, sir.
- Morning. Come, Jacob.
Come and sit. Vivek!
- Yes.
Take him away.
- Yes, sir.
At one time every house had a cow.
And now they have these.
- Of course sir.
Milk can be also got from outside.
But it is good to
have security inside.
Do you know people here were..
..against your
transfer and promotion?
They said that Dallu the
entire state is against lobbying.
In such cases if you
give important positions to..
..the ones loyal to Bhanumati,
it will be difficult.
Sir, that is problem
with our system.
Our condition is like
that of your dumb security.
No matter how diligent
we are people consider..
..us the dogs of the
one who holds our leash.
Though we are only controlled
by the Indian government.
Bhanumati also required
me the way you did.
The DM might have sent a report..
..regarding the land of
Global Ashram for verification.
I have verified it, sir.
They have illegally usurped
that land. It is wrong, sir.
That report is wrong.
The DM has sent another report.
This report states that
the Global Ashram's land..
..is controversy
less and free land.
Verify it and send
the enquiring committee.
We will deal with the
remaining formalities.
Sir, now even this file?
This is necessary to continue
with the peace, Jacob.
This is the rule of democracy.
The one who has the public rules.
Sir, please don't
take any hasty decisions.
I think this hermitage is a scam.
And global Baba is a bug criminal.
I was about to...
One shouldn't speak out
loud about such specific topics.
I know that the Baba is a rascal.
And I also know that
because of the Baba..
..Bhola Pandit was insulted.
We have got no say here.
The central defense
minister has come..
..to pay homage in his court.
Who has come?
- The defense minister. - Right.
I don't know what will
happen to Global Baba later.
But he has global power right now.
Damroo. The hermitage
seems quite different.
Inside it is even more different.
- Really?
Everything has changed.
Come.
- Who is he?
He is massage Baba.
Don't touch me. Stay away. Go away.
Please come. - You need to
go with him. Look there. Look there.
Real flying birds. Just
like 'Kill Bill'. Please go ahead.
Go.
- Damroo.
Nobody is there inside.
There no camera inside.
There is no problem.
Full service. Go and enjoy.
Several people have
been filmed, Damroo.
Nothing doing.
Trust me. Go. The Baba is coming.
Sure?
- Yes. Take him away. Go on.
Take a bath while Baba comes here.
Have fun.
""Sometimes as Ram.""
""Sometimes as Shyam.""
""Please do come, Mr. Global. Do come.""
""Come as a saint.""
""Come as a saint.""
""With a drum in one hand and
the mighty discus in the other.""
""Please do come, Mr.
Global. Do come.""
""Please do come, Mr. Global. Do come.""
This is just scorpion.
Is it going to bite me?
How many scorpions
are going to bite me?
Hail Global Godfather.
- Hello Baba.
Hello Baba.
I was refusing but Damroo
Baba and these girls...
It's good that you have come.
- I had to come.
The contractor of my department
had sung your praises.
You are responsible for
the security of the people.
So someone needs to take
charge of your security too.
Power is not permanent.
Devotees are coming from
all parts of the world..
..to understand this
game of worldliness.
You should stay here for a few
days in the hermitage's tutelage.
In the fresh air.
You will feel good.
As you wish, Baba.
Excuse me. This is the long range.
See this one.
- Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me.
Look here.
- Oh yes. Nice. Nice Good.
Show more.
This is the long range
one with throw till 500 meters.
Excuse me, sir.
- What?
Look here.
Nice. Nice. Good.
And another one
is the latest model...
You like this one?
- ..available only in Italy.
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.
Okay.
You mean something shady
is happening in Global Ashram.
No, I was just asking generally.
What is the value of a
story if one does an expose..
..on a Baba and his
illegal activities?
In the current scenario
your story will have zero value.
Because if you tell
anyone that some Baba..
..is a fraud,
a cheat, a con and that..
..sex scandals goes
on in his hermitage..
..or anything obscene
then people will say..
..what's new about it.
This is what happens there.
But if people know
that Babas are fraud..
..then where do all
these new Babas come from?
Even if they come where do
they get all these new followers?
Nice, bro.
This can be a better story.
Bhavna, see you. Mr. Minister.
- Mr. Minister.
Come on. Bhavna. Let's go.
Don't you want to take
a bite of the minister?
Take this. You can take his bite?
- What?
You can also take my
salary from now on from Dallu.
This is wrong.
Stop. I have come here first.
Global Baba had asked me
to meet Damroo Baba.
May I meet him?
- Your name?
Bhavna Sharma.
Damroo Baba, someone called
Bhavna wants to meet you.
I am a journalist.
- She is a journalist.
Pehelwan doesn't have
any record in any station.
And the officers who know him
are silent because of Bhanumati.
Tell them that Bhanumati...
Who will listen to us, sir?
Bhanumati had not issued
a circular report about him.
Nor will she.
But we do have a hope.
We should meet all the
people who are connected..
..to his dealings that we know of.
We will find some
information or a clue.
Look at this, sir.
(Gun Firing)
Hey!
Hey! Catch him.
This is Bhavna,
he corporate head of the channel.
And if any Baba uses
Global medicine on her..
..then I will kill that rascal.
She is your global sister.
Who is she?
Global sister.
- Is she only your sister?
Global sister.
Yes, very good! Go now. Move on.
Global Baba.
- Hail him.
Come Bhavna. - Global Baba.
- Hail him.
Global Baba.
- Hail him.
Bhavna, they all are devotees.
Bhavna, when I saw
you for the first time..
..I felt that we will
make a very good pair.
Just like ice-cream.
- Baba.
Yes.
I have come here to set your channel.
- Yes.
Not ice cream.
- May I address you casually?
Yes.
- You are acting so hard to get.
I have done so much for you and..
..you are not even
flirting with me.
Thank Mr. Damroo,
for doing so much for me.
I want to say I love you to you..
..and you are making fun of me.
Your voice is not old enough yet.
Let it become stronger.
Look Bhavna.
- Baba Damroo.
I am hurt.
Hail Global Baba.
Dallu has sent a message.
He said that he will
resolve our land issue..
..if we are ready
to bless him publicly.
Then sir you should bless him.
Grahan has seen a few more plots.
Global college. Global hospital.
We will make a global town.
Where did this Grahan Baba
come from?
He is our minion. Land mafia.
A champion in usurping land.
And what were you doing
with this girl from the channel?
Sir, you saw. It was nothing.
I was just explaining her the work.
You dumb person you
were teaching her work.
Or flirting with her?
A new lot of bar dancers
are coming from Mumbai.
We have to export them
to Dubai with a Yoga camp.
What will you do then?
If the sweet seller
eats all of his sweets..
..then what will he sell?
Sir, this is our personal sweet.
Tel me, if you want to have
it alone. I will do the rest.
You will arrange a girl for me?
I will fix you.
I haven't taught you a lesson
since several days. - Sorry.
Be careful.
Otherwise you might end up dead.
Go and find the
history of that girl.
And tell Dallu that
I coming to meet him. Go.
Global Baba.
- Hail him.
Global Baba.
- Hail him.
Global Baba.
- Hail him.
Global Baba.
- Hail him.
Power Baba.
- Hail him.
Who is Power Baba?
Power Baba.
- Hail him.
Isn't this the title you
are going to give me, Baba?
I have dispatched the
lease papers to the hermitage.
Now please fulfill
the rest of the deal.
And announce our union.
Everyone is waiting.
Come. Come.
Here is the channel
head of our hermitage. Come.
You?
- She was in your team till now.
Now she is with us.
- Start.
Power Baba.
- Hail him.
Power Baba.
- Hail him.
Dallu please tell us that the
land on which the Global Ashram..
..stands which belonged
to the Adivasi has..
..suddenly been declared
as infertile land.
Are you able to digest
this fact properly?
The one who cannot
digest can contact Baba.
Baba has got a lot of
exercises to treat indigestion.
So Baba, what lesson have
you imparted to Dallu that..
..he became Power Baba
from a powerless home minister?
I have only taught him
to respect public opinion.
And Baba said that Dallu
because of your dedication..
..to public service me
and all my devotees will..
..support you in
the coming elections.
Is that true, Baba?
Baba, tell us. Please speak.
Do you agree to this? Is he right?
- Yes, he is right.
I have no doubts towards his
industry towards public service.
And that's why he has
promised to allow us..
..government land
to make Global hospital..
..Global school and Global College.
Dallu, what does that mean?
- (Clap Sound)
Does that mean
you will only serve..
Global Baba and his devotees?
What about the rest?
- What about the rest?
There is nothing else, child.
The rest is your illusion.
Baba. Baba.
One more question. Dallu.
(Multiple Reporters Talking At Once)
A lot is still left, Baba.
You might even know
and recognize him.
Greetings. They greet Babas, right?
It is about how you
feel about them, child.
You have got a long life.
- God has been kind to me.
I will pray that you
have a long life too.
Global Baba.
- Hail him.
Please Damroo. Please. No.
- Come. I will drop you.
What?
- I will drop you home. Come on sit.
No, Damroo.
I will go by myself. Please.
What are you saying?
I will also meet your
family and come even closer.
Come. Come. Come.
- Look, Damroo.
I don't like mixing my
personal and professional life.
So please just let me go.
What are you saying?
There are no secrets between us.
The closer you come, the more fun it'll be.
- What are you doing, Damroo?
Let me go.
- Come with me.
Damroo.
- Hey. What is the problem?
This is our personal problem.
Get lost.
Let me go.
- Every matter on the road is personal.
Sir, she is a member of
our family in the hermitage.
So I am dropping her home.
Do you have any problem?
Not I but you will have a problem.
It will be better if the dirt
of the hermitage stays within it.
If it becomes public then
Babas like you will be in problems.
Look down. Look down!
Do you know how police
looks after their guests?
Do you know it or not?
Don't worry about the girl.
Think about yourself. Go.
Go.
Shall I?
- Go from here.
Start the car.
Okay, Bye. Take care of her. Bye.
For how much did you
sell your self-respect..
..for to these Babas?
So you will do the same
thing Damroo Baba was doing.
Embarrass me.
Either you are very innocent..
..who doesn't understand
their ulterior motives.
You understand them,
don't you Jacob?
What are you doing?
At least I am not working
for those rascals.
If not these rascals.
Then you must be working
for some other rascals.
Are there any other people in
this world besides these rascals?
Everyone wants something here.
And only for themselves.
Let the world go to hell.
This is the global
weakness of the people.
The one who cashes on it has
their governments and hermitages.
So only we are left.
People like us have
got only two options.
To work for these
government people like you.
Or work for these Holy men like me.
And hope to keep
our self-respect intact.
Wow!
It seems you have started
on a great mission..
..with complete preparations.
Someone might be in
some place maybe because..
..he is able to
fight only from there.
Having different fighting
grounds doesn't mean..
..that we should
have different enemies.
'You must know and recognize them.'
'Greetings.
They greet Babas, right?'
'You have got a long life.'
Sir. What happened?
How many 302 Babas do
we have in our hermitage?
Several, sir.
Tell them that they
need to be careful.
""Intoxicated eyes.""
""Sweet talks.""
""Buzzing like the bees.""

waiting for has come.""

(Door Closes)
Chauhan, call the fire
brigade and ambulance.
How will you reach
such a cunning person?
He has removed all
traces for us to reach him.
You are removing old evidences.
But you are creating new evidences.
I felt that you have understood..
..that no one catch me.
Wearing a saffron garb
doesn't make one God.
You are still the same
person for me like before.
Times have changed a lot, Jacob.
Before I was someone's dog.
But today I have so many
dogs that if I set them..
..after you then you
won't have anywhere to run.
Pehelwan you should
be thinking of running away.
The day I will get
one evidence against you..
..I will kill you in
front of the same people..
..who had made you God.
Remember that.
Don't make this enmity
personal, Jacob.
You will regret.
No warrior can hurt
any Baba in India.
If this matter advances that..
..the animal which is eaten by your
community is worshipped by mine.
Do you even realize
how many people will die..
..form both communities
if war starts?
Go Jacob.
That day you had given
me a chance to run.
I will look away today.
Go out of the hermitage
with full respect.
Consider that the death
sentence on your head..
..has been waived off.
Global Baba.
- Hail him.
Baba, I am sick of
the quarrels at my home.
Before we used to
have a joint family.
We used to live together.
And then my mother-in-law
had it partitioned.
And since then quarrels
have never stopped.
What do you wipe your house with?
It is an old pajama of my husband.
That is the root
of all your problems.
Change that cloth and make a wipe..
..out of your
mother-in-law's petticoat.
Soon you will be globally blessed.
Gudiya, go and check what
cloth do we use to wipe our house?
Yes.
It is very important for
women to know their limits.
If you cross your limits then..
..the devils outside will nab you.
This rape etc. is happening
because of a woman's lust.
If women can control
their lust... Stop!
Who wrote this bad discourse?
Me.
- You?
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to be
in trouble by saying all this?
Baba how will be in the news
if you don't make controversies?
Such statements give
you free publicity worth..
..millions in twitter,
Facebook etc.
I will write it if you
just want to say good things.
But nobody pays
attention to such things.
Is it?
But the youth today
doesn't understand things..
..like emotions,
control, limits, etc.
And I am only targeting the youth.
Please change this speech.
- Yes.
Baba, phone.
Who is calling?
- An international devotee.
Hello?
Hello?
Yes. Oh yes.
Oh yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Did you record it?
- Yes.
Bhavna.
- Yes, Baba.
A devotee from France
was speaking in German.
Please find out what he is saying.
It is recorded.
Yes.
- Be careful with that.
Come here.
Sir, this girl is not trustworthy.
Don't let her come too close.
- Why?
Nothing.
I also got trapped with
the police once because of her.
I asked her to sit
in the car but she didn't..
..and created a scene.
The policeman came
and threatened me.
And she didn't even defend me, sir.
This girl is not trustworthy.
You guaranteed the trustworthiness
of this girl, right?
And now you are suspecting her.
Who is untrustworthy?
This girl or you?
No, sir. She has a good heart.
I can read faces.
But she is under pressure.
- Mad man.
Are you going to tell
me if she is under pressure?
Her father is in the
hospital for the last 7 years.
Her brother is in
rehab for drug abuse.
Sir, you have got her bio data.
I was about to find all that.
- When?
After it was too late.
Go and manage your loose change.
You cannot manager her. Go.
How are you pervert Baba?
Pervert Baba.
- Witch.
Pervert Baba.
- Sir, they are from Mumbai.
They are taking advantage
of me since I was nice to them.
Once there deal is done
tomorrow I will be free.
Everyone is calling me
pervert because of them.
I am feeling very bad.
Jacob, what do I do with this Baba?
He sends a new proposal
for land every day to approve.
And if do approve it
I will be jailed for sure.
And if I don't approve it
then I will lose the elections.
Sir, I don't know about
the elections but if you want..
..to overpower the Baba
then there is one person..
..in this state who can do this.
- Who?
The one who has Baba's
entire horoscope.
Sir, I will arrange the meeting.
It is your job to call Baba.
Come Baba. Come.
Why is your Dally Yadav
such a big politician?
It is a matter of a small land.
It is not a deal for illegal
cocaine to call this secret meeting.
It is not that, Baba.
The elections are coming.
The press is tracking him
like vultures.
Both Dallu and you
will be in trouble..
..if this deal is made public.
Child, my hermitage is
founded on all these problems.
So don't try to impart
knowledge to me.
Baba. Baba.
it will be better if you go alone.
I am waiting him.
He has come. Greetings, Baba.
I had thought that
you had arranged..
..a great press
conference like last time.
That conference made
me realize of your activities.
You made me bend
so low at your feet..
..that my waist is still sprained.
Bhanumati.
Bhanumati? And here? - (Door Closes)
Hey. Don't call anyone.
When a person is
scared what does he say?
Hello.
- How are you, Dallu?
I am fine. Please have a seat.
All right. So you are Global Baba.
I have heard a lot about you.
Please sit.
Why are you standing?
I have sent you a personal request.
Yes, Mr. Mishra told me about it.
Yes.
- I am thinking about it.
Dallu, can you leave us
alone for some time.
I have somehow found time
to meet Baba.
Why not.
If you...
- Okay, bye.
Baba, I wanted to listen
to some discourse by you.
But what can I do?
Elections are approaching.
I have to finalize
the list of the candidates.
We have promised to have
a crime free government this time.
Isn't that a good promise?
Now I don't have time
to take your wisdom.
So I thought of giving
you some wisdom.
The hermitage you
have in Kabirganj.
The minority communities
are very angry about it.
They don't have much
land left for them.
What will they do if
you take that away too?
So I want you to clear off
from that place..
..with that shame
of a hermitage of yours.
In fact it is better
if you leave this state..
..and start your game
in some other state.
Tell me,
if you have any problem here?
I have got millions
of devotees today.
They might get disappointed.
What will I tell them when
they ask me where I am going?
Tell them that you
had an inner calling...
One minute. One minute.
If you don't mind than
I will record your message.
What do you mean?
Just a minute. Give me a minute.
Who is Damroo Baba?
- Me.
You have been called inside.
- May I? - Yes.
(Door Opens)
Global Baba. - Close the door
and take out the mobile fast.
We need to record
Bhanumati's video.
What is this drama all about?
These are just 4 lines.
Just write it down.
No. It is not enough
for us to write it down.
We need to record it.
Don't take my video.
Take his. Your boss.
You need to take his recording.
I get recorded often.
You should have one now.
What do you mean?
- Talk about wisdom.
Wisdom.
Have you lost your mind?
When this cat says
wisdom you can hear it.
Have you lost your mind?
Say wisdom. Wisdom.
- Behave properly.
Chillum, have you gone crazy?
Do you know your standing? My dog...
Why have he called him inside?
Sometimes we have
such co-incidence..
..that it really
feels that God exists.
I had never thought that
I will get such an easy..
..chance to take my revenge on her.
Look. Why are you struggling?
She is resting for some time.
She said she doesn't
want to be disturbed.
Car.
Hello?
We have received a
shocking news regarding..
..the state assembly elections.
Bhanumati has
selected Global Baba..
..as the candidate from
the Kabirganj constituency.
Dallu Yadav have lost hope..
..after the advent of Global Baba.
- I call you later.
Bhanumati has
announced Global Baba..
..as the candidate from
the Kabirganj her party.
""Sometimes as Ram.""
""Sometimes as Shyam.""
""Come Global. Do come.""
Hello, Mr.
Minister. Hello, Mr. Minister.
Mr. Minister, I am shocked
as to why Bhanumati did this.
There was no logical
reason for this.
Who is this?
Hail Global Godfather.
Where did you get this number from?
I know everything.
I also know that
Bhanumati's favorite dog..
..Jacob is also there with you.
And it is good to say
that you have hurt yourself.
(Laughing)
Did you call me to make fun of me?
I am calling you to say thanks.
You had arranged such
a good meeting with Bhanumati.
It was fun.
Continue to send such good gifts..
..to me in the future too.
I don't like small gifts.
(Laughing)
Excuse me ma'am.
I just spoke with
media head, Gupta.
He says that since the
time we have added Global Baba..
..to our party since
then upper class people..
..from the Eastern region
are also joining the party.
Congratulations.
So what is all this wrong Hindi?
Why don't you check?
What do you want?
That I should fail before
I even become a minister.
I am sorry, Baba. I don't know how...
Where is Nepali Baba. Call him.
He will be my election in-charge.
He has to start my promotion.
Why do you need Nepali Baba?
I am there.
Your PA. I will manage everything.
No minister's PA
speaks with a slur.
(Laughing)
Take care of them. That suits you.
""Hail. Hail. Hail Baba.""
This time.
- Baba's government.
This time.
- Baba's government.
This time.
- Baba's government.
I have joined politics
so that I can bring..
..back all the black
money deposited abroad.
So that our India become
a shining golden bird again.
I am forced to delve
in dirty politics..
..so that I can get rid
of other corrupted politicians.
Global Baba.
- Hail him.
Their income is in
international banks.
Then why is our income taxed?
If you want to save
the heritage of India..
..then you have to get the
good and true ascetics to power.
The glorious future
of our country depends..
..on the inclusion of
Global Ashram in the assembly.
Global Baba.
- Hail him.
51% seats.
That means Global Baba has got..
..51% support from the public.
Dallu Yadav is getting 34% support.
And the others are
getting 15% support.
Uncle.
- Yes.
Offerings.
Call Bhavna.
Tell her that it is time
to expose the Baba. - Yes.
Sir, if you don't
mind may I say something?
Don't involve her
in this matter, sir.
Because Bhavna cannot
handle this matter.
Trust me.
- Shut up.
I am in this situation
because of this.
Global 51% and Dallu Yadav 34%.
It seems that I haven't
done politics for 40 years.
What the heck.
- One minute. Sir, Bhavna.
Hello, Bhavna.
Hello.
- Bless you. Bless you. How is papa?
Listen. Do one thing, dear.
He will win.
- Global Baba will win.
He will win.
- Global Baba will win.
He will win.
- Global Baba will win.
He will win.
- Global Baba will win.
Dallu Yadav.
- Hail him.
Dallu Yadav.
- Hail him.
The Baba will be exposed soon.
The power of truth...
Go. Go. Go.
What are you hiding? Show. Check.
Baba.
- Yes. Tell me, girl.
I am listening to you.
Baba, I have a request for you.
It would be very kind
of you if you allow me..
..to go by the green channel
after duty.
Do you want to take something
outside the hermitage?
By stealth.
Yes. My honor.
The Baba's frisk very
indecently at the gates.
I don't like it.
Good girls are not always smart.
Smart girls are not always good.
And the one who are
both are not beautiful.
And the one who is
beautiful is not a girl.
You are uniquely endowed
with all these qualities.
I don't understand.
You have gone against me
for that lowly Dally Yadav.
Why?
Oh no, Baba. You misunderstand.
It's a waste of time
and words when two..
..smart people try
to fool each other.
You wanted to have
your father operated on..
..for the last 5 years
who was rotting in the hospital.
He got operated on 2 days ago.
Where did the money come from?
The hermitage didn't pay it.
Are you going to tell me yourself?
Or should I show
you the bank statements?
Dallu Yadav wants to expose me
with your help today.
No.
The way you have made videos
of this entire hermitage.
You want to give that to him, right?
- No. No.
Tell me the truth.
- No. - Tell me.
What is this?
- This contains the real stuff.
Right?
Sorry, Baba.
You will work at the Baba's.
What?
For me.
Don't forget that your father
is at the government hospital.
And I am the government.
Sorry Baba.
I have to finish the work
I have started. Munna.
What does this have?
He is looking for this.
Take it to Dallu Yadav.
Please Baba. Please.
- Please. Please. Please.
Please Baba.
- Look.
Mannu.
No Baba. Please let him go.
Baba, please.
I haven't done anything.
Your bother will be freed as
soon as your work is done. - (Crying)
My brother.
- Munna. - Yes.
Take madam out through
the green channel.
I haven't done anything.
- Her wish should be granted. Go.
Please Baba. Let him go. Please.

The Baba has told me. Get lost. Go.
""The Baba has a simple theory.""
""He tales god's name
and keeps a girl by his side.""
""A little property everywhere.""
""A little hope. And a little life.""
I am calling here but I
am not able to get through to her.
What are you saying?
- She must be on her way.
""The Baba is a pervert.""
Move. Move.
Go away. Get lost. Move.
What drama is going on here?
Nepali went through the
green channel with that girl.
When I told him to stop
he said you had told him to.
Yes, I have. What's the problem?
Sir, why don't you understand?
That girl is not trustworthy.
I keep a special eye on her.
Special eye!
Where? On her lips or her cheeks?
What rubbish!
If I had not kept an eye on you..
..then we would have
been ruined by now.
Now stop thinking about that girl..
..and keep a watch at the gate.
You are only fit for that.
And let Munna do his job. Get lost.
Sir, you have given
that Nepali my uniform.
He was teasing me by wearing it.
And you are having fruits alone.
What is wrong with you sir?
What are you hiding from me?
Tell me.
Are you my wife that
I am answerable to you?
Get lost otherwise if I lose my head...
- Don't do that.
Get lost. Out.
""Venerate the mind.""
""And the fragrance of incense.""

I am about to reach. Yes.
I will keep you updated, Baba.
Yes, everything will be fine.
Don't worry.
Global greetings.
- Move.
One minute, Baba.
Baba, Damroo is calling. Yes?
Where have you gone with Bhavna?
Why do you want to know about it?
Mind your own business.
It is Damroo.
Damroo Baba. Tell me, what is it?
I am on hotline with Baba.
Hang up now.
The one you think
as Baba was a criminal.
Small time criminal.
He was shot at. I saved him.
And I have made this hermitage..
..with my brains an efforts.
And you... You thief!
Mind your own business, dumb man.
This is Damroo.
When it is time I will
tell you what is it. Hang up.
He has hung up on me.
Everyone thinks I am nothing.
Damroo Baba. Global...
- Get lost!
""The Baba is a pervert.""
""The Baba is a pervert.""

Hail Global Baba.
Yes. She is going.
Go back.
Boss, Jacob is here.
Just give me order.
Press the button.
Start the car.
There is a breaking news.
The blast in Kabirganj
has killed 9 and 70 were injured.
It has been shamed
and called cowardly.
Global Baba's TV
journalist Bhavna Sharma..
..has died in this blast.
Bhavna Sharma's death has
been confirmed by the government.
The government said
that the injured are being..
..treated at the
district hospitals.
Sir, I have done an independent..
..inquiry for this accident.
I need your permission.
Sir, the media is
just showing hogwash.
The truth is being concealed.
I mean it, sir.
I can't give you any
permission on this, Jacob.
Anyway the CBI will
deal with it now.
You are getting your
transfer orders today.
You can't do this to me, sir. You...
- Sorry Jacob.
Sorry. And I can't help you.
- Sir, listen to me...
Don't disturb, Devansh.
- Hi papa.
Wow papa.
- What is that?
What happened, papa? Are you sick?
- Devansh...
Papa is ill. Go.
- I am ill.
You go!
- Shut up.
Shut up.
I escaped the bomb and
now you will shout and kill me.
Take him away.
- Uncle, phone. It's Baba. - Baba?
Greetings, Baba.
Dallu Yadav. How are you?
Baba, I escaped because
of your kindness.
Baba, please forgive my mistakes.
I am withdrawing my
name from the election.
I am giving up politics.
Now I will only serve you, Baba.
Please take me in.
Hello. We will start
the news today..
..with the bomb blast in Kabirganj.
The home minister of
the state Dallu Yadav..
..has said that foreign powers
are responsible for it.
In the beginning
it was said that the..
..Global Ashram was
responsible for this blast.
Actually this idea
was raised since this..
..bomb blast happened
in Dallu Yadav's expose rally.
That the Global Ashram might..
..be responsible for this blast.
But Dallu Yadav has clarified that...
It is being said that
the blast in Kabirganj..
..was ordered by foreign powers.
Mister.
You?
I have come to give you something.
Keep this.
What is this?
This is the stuff which
can defeat the greatest warriors.
What do you mean?
I mean it contains all
the antics of Global Baba.
Here you are, sir.
Why are you giving it to me?
Because people trusts him.
And I am someone who
can turn dust into gold..
..and then turn gold into dust.
Tell me one thing...
I won't speak now.

greater than the era of royalty.""

The movie starts by showing a lodge where a policeman is raping a young girl and then goes out to meet the girl's boyfriend. The policeman blackmailed the couple because he caught them with drugs and the girl made a deal with him to have sex in exchange for dropping all charges. After the policeman leaves, he gets into an accident. When he regains his consciousness, he finds himself chained where a computer genius hacks a TV channel owned by Rahul Oberoi and broadcasts the live murder of a police officer called Ramesh Sarniak. The Assistant Commissioner of Police, Kabir Deshmukh, interrogates Rahul Oberoi wherein Siya, a lawyer, tries to defend his case. Sia has her boyfriend, Ranveer Bajaj, with whom she has an intimate relationship. He is a prosecution lawyer.

During the investigation, Kabir Deshmukh considers Karan Parekh, Rahul's old business partner, to be the suspect. ACP Deshmukh tracks Karan's location in a hotel and goes to catch him. Upon reaching the hotel, he discovers that Karan is missing and is also being murdered on live television. Later, ACP Deshmukh finds out that Rahul and Karan were involved in raping a girl named Rajni, an employee in Rahul's company. ACP Deshmukh reveals this to Ranveer and Sia wherein Ranveer speaks out about the fact that an old man had saved Rajni from being raped and filed a complaint against Rahul and Karan. At that time, Rahul and Karan were prosecuted by Ranveer in the court. However, Ranveer lost the case as the old man had died in a fire explosion in his house and was the only witness for that case.

Now, it is clear that Rahul was not involved in any of the murders. Eventually, the police consider Rajni to be the suspect. Rahul now decides to flee India, but is not allowed to leave because his sugar level drastically increases. In no time, the police get to know that Rajni has gone missing and learn that Mac, Rajni's boyfriend who is also an employee in Rahul's company, is involved in the murders.

As ACP Deshmukh learns that Rahul is to be hospitalized, he goes in search of Mac to save Rahul from being killed. ACP Deshmukh runs behind that ambulance and learns that Rahul is missing. Mac takes Rahul to the same place where the police officer, Ramesh Sarniak, and Karan Parekh had been killed. Rahul finds himself tied and gets shocked when he sees Sia there. Sia reveals to Rahul that she is the one who killed the officer Sarnaik and Karan. It is further revealed by Sia that the old man who helped Rajni didn't die in an explosion but was murdered by Rahul, Karan, and the officer Sarnaik. Sia further reveals that the old man who was killed was Sia's father. Sia then attempts to kill Rahul by increasing his sugar level. During the process, Rahul reveals to Sia that it was of no use to kill them as the real killer is still alive. Rahul tells her that Ranveer was bribed by Rahul and Karan to save them and also planned the murder.

Thus, Rahul dies and, heartbroken, Sia leaves from there. Soon, ACP Deshmukh discovers that Sia is the killer. Sia takes Ranveer to the same place where the murders were committed and reveals to him the truth and also tells him to admit his crime. Knowing this, Ranveer refuses to do so but is being tricked by Sia as she had called the police and the whole statement was recorded and traced during her call.

This leads to a fight between them in which ACP Deshmukh arrives and fights with Ranveer. During the fight Ranveer is killed, and ACP Deshmukh resigns from his job, knowing what he and the other murder victims had done, decides to not press any charges against Sia and sets her free.",3626,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt5638474.srt","Those are tears of joy, right?

I'm comfortable mostly at night.
Sorry.
""Took longer than I expected.
Nice girlfriend.
She's a bit emotional.
How did she fall for
a drug-addict like you?
Sir, we were not taking drugs.
We just happened to be at the party?
- Hey..
Stop ranting in English, right.
Bloody ****
Your mother runs an NGO.
Father is a social
activist on news channel.
And were you giving
spiritual lessons.
...to the girl
on your car's backseat?
Ohhh..if you do it,
its enjoyment.
And if we do it, it's harassment.
You're from a good family.
You've already proved that.

Stop ruining your future.
Go in..go inside.
She's waiting for you.
Go on..
""I'm obsessed
aboutmaking you mine.""
Karan sir, am I disturbing you?
Speak!
I haven't received my packet yet.
I've already paid you in full.
Look sir, crime and alcohol
become invaluable as they grow old.
Don't they?
It was a big mistake.
...to think that a cunning
basm like you would be loyal.
Loyal as a dog sir..
Have I ever given
you a chance to complain?
You won't anymore.
I am going to settle
your account once and for all.
I hope you mean that, sir.
And you're not furious with me.
Bloody ***
""..come closer and..""
Who..who are you?
Who are you?
I think we're hacked.
Cheap
death by expensive petrol.
A chilling
death which may make your soul shiver.
How
and when this happened?
This
murder of a police officer.
...seems
entangled like a thread.
A murder
as gruesome as most foul.
Probably one of
the saddest in the history of crime.
And we've news that Global
Time Network CEO Mr. Rahul Oberoi..
""The media mogul.
Has been asked for questioning.
Death on rampage.
Grimm
Reapers have a ball.
Is Rahul Oberoi the
mastermind behind all this?
Yes..the same Rahul
Oberoi who owns Global Times Network.
Sir..sir..
ACP Sarnaik was murdered on channel,
What do you have to say about it, sir?
Who dared to summon me
here like a ordinary criminal?
Do you guys have any idea who I am?
Your minister's on my payroll.
Well sir,
who is on whose payroll..
...that's strictly between you two.
That's strictly personal.
We're just doing our job.
I am Rahul Oberoi.
The CEO of Global Times Network!
India's most
power-ful..media house.
Big fan.
Big fan!
I am Kabir Deshmukh.
A humble servant of India's strongest
and most effective Police force.
Mumbai Police.
How dare you call me here?
Every minute of mine
is worth millions.
You should respect time,
not put a price-tag on it.
Sir, I've done some research.
Correct me if I am wrong.
Your ratings were
falling..profits were falling.
You were losing
credibility in the market.
And then..this cheap stunt.
Live Murder on Television!
Was it your idea?
Absolutely right.
Congratulations.
You just solved the entire case.
Must be my idea.
I pay millions in salary to creative
directors, editors and program heads.
...so that they give me
such out-of-the-box ideas..
...and the ratings
of my TV channel soar.
And then I throw a
grand party..in Tihar Jail.
Actually sir,
if you do go to jail..
...you'll be sent to Yerwada jail.
Next question.
If not you..
""Then who?
We were hacked.
How do you know?
We've done our research, officer.
You can talk to
my technical head Mak.
He's in Delhi right now.
But he's arriving
by the evening flight.
Sir..let's take this step-by-step.
Let's deal with you first.
I've an entire question
paper prepared for you.
Officer, stay within your limits.
Don't cross your limit.
- Limit?
We just saw your limit
live on your Television channel.
But you haven't
seen our limit yet.
Pray to God that you're
as innocent as you claim to be.
Gaitonde.
- Yes, sir.
Set the AC to 18
..he's sweating.
Right?
Now, as the
proceedings continue, all we know..
...is that Rahul Oberoi is
still being questioned inside.
And
we all are clueless.
So sir, you have no clue.
You didn't know
ACP Sarnaik as well.
You don't suspect any
of your rival channels either.
You're just a honest
tax-paying citizen.
You don't know how your
systems were hacked either.
Mak does.
Basically you have no clue.
Sir, if this continues any longer,
we can come to only one conclusion.
Either you are..or someone's
making you look like one big..
You're too under-qualified..
...to judge who or what I am,
officer.
Sir, you see..my
qualification is that.
...I can use my service revolver
on whoever..and whenever I want.
“With no questions asked.
You know what,
you're wasting my time.
An entire life got wasted
on Global Times Network.
An ACP has been murdered.
You will have to give us time.
Anyway,
it was a pleasure meeting you.
You must deposit your
passport with us and..
""This is my number, save it.
And please,
don't forward any cheap jokes.
Leave.
Where the hell is Siya.
Call her.
- Okay, sir.
Good morning, ma'am.
- Hi.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Good morning, ma'am.
- Hi.
""And the Mumbai
Police has accused.""
""..Global Times Network's
CEO Rahul Oberoi for this murder..""
I am a national scene now.
All these years I
lead the news business..
...and today I've become
some cheap news myself.
The media mogul
is on trial by media.
That bloody no-good
police officer.
...was treating me like
I was a pick-pocketeer.
I'm left all alone, Rahul.
You're not alone, Rahul.
I am there for you.
I am your legal head,
and you know I am good at my job.
Nothing will happen to you.
Siya, I will destroy
that bloody Kabir.
He thinks,
rather he believes that..
...I did this for ratings.
Did you do it..or not?
Siya, you're sounding
just like Kabir.
I've never met such a
crooked officer in my life.
He's not crooked, he's straight.
He has a clean record.
Don't confuse your ego with him.
I will buy him.
- He has no price-tag.
Just relax, Rahul.
Just follow protocol,
and do as I say.
As long as I am there,
no one can touch you.
And..what if I want to touch you?
Then you will lose this case,
Rahul Oberoi.
Let's pray..there's no sequel
or second episode to this live murder.
Talk to Mak..and ignore Kabir.

Even the fragrance
of all these flowers.
""Cannot deluge
your fragrance, Ranvir.
Then give this fragrance

Hi.
Late on a date.
You'll have to pay fine.
I am 'fine' with it, Suhani.
Would you convince
mom with muffins too?
No, sweetheart.
This muffin shop hadn't
open at that time.
You miss your mom.
Only when you come late.
Do you miss her?
- No ways.
After all..l get her share
of kisses and hugs too.
Nice try,
but I am still not talking to you.
Why?
A big green monster
came to my room last night.
And I was all alone in my room.
Oh my, God.
There were some complications
in my life, I am so sorry.
But tonight your green
monster is done for.
You think only your life's
complicated? Not mine?
I am the best dancer in the class.
But Archana miss didn't
put me in the centre.
Can your police force do
something about this..serious issue?
Sit down. Sit down.
The police force can't.
But your dad will advise
you to work harder.
Impress Archana miss.
And in your next concert
you will be the show-stopper.
Right?
' Very good.
Sorry. Just a minute.
Phone.
Yes, Gaitonde.
- Sir, we've found Mak.
Yes..l am coming.
Eat.
Okay?'-
You're leaving?
I am sorry, dear.
That dancer behind
stage has come up front.
But I promise, tonight we'll
arrest your green monster together.
Okay?
Give me a five.
See you.
Jai Hind, sir.
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
Sir, we were waiting
for you..can we star-t now?
Mr. Rahul, good morning.
Did you sleep well?
This is Siya, my legal head.
And that is Mak, my technical head.
Mak.
Makrand Moge.
Can we star-t'?
- Wait, Mr. Rahul.
You just introduced me to your team.
""Now, how about you meet
our team-player as well.
Mr. Ranvir Bajaj,
State counselor on this case.
Good morning, gentlemen.
And of course, lady.
I hope I've not missed anything.
No-no, we were waiting for you.
So good..we may star-t now.
So gentlemen, as we all
know that our network was hacked.
And it's a fact.
In order to prove this fact,
Mak has made a presentation.
I think after hearing that,
things will be clearer.
So we're living in the age
of fast travelling information.
Information..is created at
one source, and goes to the receiver.
That means, for any
information to travel anywhere..
...we need a source and a receiver.
Same applies to TV broadcasting.
This is the Global Times
Network's source station.
From here, their entire content.
...is transmitted to their
satellite through signal package.
Now, from the satellite it's
transmitted to the broadcast central.
For example 'Sky Dish'..'National
Dish'..etcetera-etcetera..and others.
And..again they transmit
it to the satellite.
And from here, it's retransmitted
to the dish antenna.
Now, the content is decrypted
through our dish antenna..
...and seen on our TV
through the set-top box.
This hacker..hacked our frequency“.
...transmitting from
GTN to the satellite.
Once it's hacked,
then the hacker can play God.
I mean..he can command
what's goes to the satellite.
...and what does not.
So why didn't
your..engineers stop him?
Well..this was a very
high-level hacking maneuver.
By the time we could
understand what's happening.
...it was already over.
And you let it happen.
Well, we tried our best to stop it.
But as you know,
we're a huge organization.
And there are protocols to follow.
So it took us time to
follow all the procedures.
Very interesting.
I am sure that even
your cyber-cell will agree..
...that we were hacked.
And now, if there's anything
that's not understood.
...we'll be happy to answer.
How can we trace a hacker like this?
Actually, first of all
we've to think like them.
Don't tell me your
chaps didn't try that.
Of course we did,
but the hacker was smart.
He used multiple login IDs
to hack the Global Times Network.
And the last ID we traced,
was on the US.
I knew it.
Meaning?
Sometimes you can get hacked
with a simple phone call.
And..how is that?
Well..the hacker just
needs to hack the medium.
And the medium can be anything.
For example, video-calls, phone-calls,
radio-signals..and IP address as well.
IP address as well.
Yes, IP address as well.
You can customize your phone
number through the IP address..
...and call anyone.
And they will never know
who the hacker is, and where.
I hope it's clear.
And what kind of equipments
do you require for all this?
Simple..
High-speed internet..and
a high-end laptop.
Sometimes just a phone maybe.
WOW!
That's it, huh?
And a genius mind.
Like you.
And a motive too.
Absolutely right.
And we've no motives,
we're the victims.
Right?
Establishing a motive..is my job.
And let me do my job, Ms. Siya.
So you can wait for that moment.
We would like to leave.
Thank you for your time, gentlemen.
What do you think?
No chance.
Actually we don't
have any evidence either.
The court won't grant us
even an hour for interrogation.
But trust me.
I know people like Rahul very well.
If he's done something,
he'll definitely make a mistake.
""Which will be in our favor.
So be it, sir.
Sir..Sarnaik sir's phone
records have arrived.
If we want to make
some progress in this case..
...we'll have to go
few steps backwards.
Come, Gaitonde..let's listen
to Sarnaik sir's history.
'Karan sir, am I disturbing you?'
'It was a big mistake.'
...to think that a cunning
basm like you would be loyal.'
Loyal as a dog sir..
Have I ever given
you a chance to complain?'
'You won't anymore.'
I am going to settle
your account once and for all.'
'I hope you mean that, sir.'
'And you're not furious with me.'
<i>Karen Parekh.</i>
Mumbai's real-estate magnet.
Goa's casino king.
Collector of Derby horses.
Ramesh Sarnaik, ACP Mumbai Police.
What cat and mouse
game were they playing?
Sir, I think we've
reached the next level.
For that, we've to understand
the level of Sarnaik's every case.
Back in the headquarters, you
were trying to be over-smart, Ranvir.
Not cool.
If someone's paying you a six-digit
salary, doesn't mean he's innocent.
Rahul is a shrewd business.
Not a psychopath like that hacker,
whoever he is.
And he's honestly admitted
that he's not involved.
Honesty..Rahul?
You seriously believe
what Rahul said?
He can stoop to any
level for his business.
How can you trust him?
So that makes him a murderer.
I have a mind too.
And I feel,
rather I am sure that he's innocent.
Only time will tell.
It's a open and shut case, Ranvir.
No logic, no evidence, no proof.
And I am telling you this.
Siya..
...you know..
- What?
When you get angry..
You look really beautiful.
You know what.
I know.
I think..Rahul Oberoi's
going to be s****
And why do you think that?
Because even God can't
win against a furious lover..
...let alone this owner
of Global Network.
I see..
Furious love and all.
I likes.
Rohini..didn't die in a car accident,
she was murdered.
Karan got her killed.
My child tolerated
that animal for so long.
Later when she realized
it was enough..
""Then we filed for divorce.
We had extensive
evidence against him.
But just one day before
the court's judgment.
...Rohini died in a car accident.
No wife, no divorce, no alimony..
No justice, no daughter.
Karan wrapped up the
case out of the court.
We are..
We're helpless old couple.
We're only waiting
for..God's justice.
I can understand your pain.
I assure you..justice
can be delayed, but not denied.
Right sir, thank you.
- You're welcome.
I'll be in touch,
and if anything comes up, I will..
Sir..do all your cars get
serviced at Trinity Motors?
Do you have service
records of your cars?
Yes, I have them.
Hurry up, come on.
Imagine Gaitonde.
...all the cars of a family..
""Gets serviced
at the same workshop.
...by the same mechanic,
for all these years.
And one of the car
has a brake failure.
So..should we hold God responsible
for it, or the mechanic?
Sir, I feel..we can
suspect the mechanic.
Huh?
- Yes.
But sir..where are the
factssupponing your theory?
Here you go.
- Thank you.
What happened?
Sometimes a small piece
of paper..can solve a big case.
Good day, sir. I'll be seeing you.
Any luck?
I don't know about luck..but
Karan's bad luck is about to begin.
Gaitonde, all the service records
have been signed by the same mechanic.
Some Chanderpal.
You mean to say the brakes
didn't fail, it was sabotaged.
I am not saying it. Chanderpal will.
H ow?
We'll request him..to
please cooperate.
Come on.
- Sir.
Mister.
Yes, sir.
- Who is Chanderpal?
Chandu, someone's here to see you.
There he is, sir.
Yes, sir..what's the job?
We're fans of your talent.
Can you fix..car brakes?
Sir, stop Misting words.
Get to the point, what is the job?
I like him.
- Me too.
Well..I'll get to the point.
Can you sabotage brakes?
Are you police officers?
Hey..only two kinds
of people recognize police.
The Police..or criminals.
You're not the Police.
Look sir..l am a poor mechanic.
I don't understand
what you're trying to say.
Who told you to sabotage
Sabarwars brakes?
What?
Look here, Gaitonde here
is just as good with a stick..
...like you are in acting.
Come on.
Don't hit me! Don't hit me!
I'll tell you, sir..I'll tell you!
Let Gaitonde practice some more.
It's been really long
since he's had a chance.
Sir, I beg you..
Let me go.
Karan sir gave me the
money..to sabotage the brakes.
How much did he pay you, Chandu?
He paid me 70,000.
What did you do with
the money, Chandu?
I bought a 40 inch TV, sir.
Oh..now taste this
52 inch police truncheon.
Sir..don't hit me, sir..don't hit me.
I told you everything, sir.
Leave me sir.
This punishment is just
for sabotaging the brakes.
You still have to pay for the
death caused by the brake failure.
Sir, please..please..
If the brakes failed..then how did it
become a accident case in the court?
Sarnaik sir had a hand in it, sir.
I see..
- Yes.
H ow?
Sir, I am a poor man.
I don't know so much in detail.
What do you think, Gaitonde?
Does he really not know anything else?
You know what,
sir..l don't want to believe him.
Okay?'-
You can have your fun with him
until you're not completely assured.
And yes..get the paperwork
done and keep him inside.
Or else he'll sabotage
our investigation.
Isn't it?
No, sir..
Sir!
I can arrest Karan right now.
He got his wife killed.
Sarnaik covered it up.
Later Sarnaik blackmailed
Karan for money.
And Karan killed Sarnaik.
There's a logical flow in all of it..
""But it all gets
stuck in one place.
...why telecast it live
on Global TV Network?
And how does Rahul
Oberoi fit in all this?
I'll help you.
Huh? What?
You know Karan and
Rahul were partners.
In fact, Karan had a
stake in Global Times Network.
But these two had a major
fallout regarding money.
They in fact had a big
spat in the board meeting.
Rahul sc**** Karan out
of approximately 10 billion.
Then what?
Karan was so furious,
that he openly claimed to ruin Rahul.
Are you serious?
How do you know that?
Even I have my sources.
Inside-trading.
Revenge was the motive.
He got two birds with one stone.
Fantastic.
With Sarnaik dead, there's
no evidence to Rohini murder case.
And live murder on TV
means..Rahul Oberoi is finished.
Where are your feet, sir?
No-no..right now,
you must trouble your feet.
And take a statement from Rahul..
...stating that Karan
threatened to kill him.
I am sure Rahul will
be happy to give it to you.
Come on..run before Karan runs away.
Siya..do you have any
family details of Sarnaik?
Why?
I wanted to send some
flowers and a thank you card.
You know..while dying,
a stranger..made our channel no. 1
It's funny.
There's success hidden
behind my ruination.
I am having a dream run.
You're such a sick man, Rahul.
Then why don't you cure me?
Believe me,
Siya..only your love can cure me.
In your dreams.
Yeah.
Sir, ACP Kabir Deshmukh from
Mumbai Police is here to see you.
Shall I send him in.
Send him.
- Okay, sir.
Kabir?
- Yeah.
Relax, Rahul.
Hello.
Sir, why do you make
faces when you see me?
The police don't always
come with an arrest warrant.
Right?
This time I have good news.
Sorry..breaking news.
What do you mean?
<i>Karen.</i>
<i>Karen Parekh.</i>
Your best friend.
That rascal.
What rascal, Mr. Rahul.
He just made your ratings soar.
He's been a true friend.
He did break a few laws in
the process, but we'll handle those.
You just sign this statement..
And later you can play
'Breaking-news' all you like.
Can I see this statement?
- Of course, yeah.
What is all this, Rahul?
Sir, you can sign this later.
You can explain this to him later""
...and you can understand
this from her later.
I have to go.

Does sir know you're coming?
No ma'am,
we're here to give him a surprise.
Sir is in room no. 1211.
Thank you.
Gaitonde.
- Sir.
Staircase.
- Okay, sir.
Let's go.
- Quick.
1211?
Where is Karan?
- You guys...
Where is Karan?
But he just got up to open the door.
What?
How long ago?
Just 5 minutes before you arrived.
'1211...'
House-keeping service
at this late hour?
Gaitonde.
Seal all the
entry/exits of the hotel.
Check every floor,
search every corner of the hotel.
Karan shouldn't get out of here.
Exits block.
What's wrong, sir? What is it?
What happened?
Yes, Avinash?
- Sir, Karan's live on GTN.
What?
- Yes, sir.
May I have the remote please?
- Yes sir.
Rahul, are you watching?
Yes.
I am coming.
Keep trying-
Sir...
Got it.
Yes, Avinash?
Sir, we've traced the
location to an IP address.
Where? - There's a chawl just
ten minutes from where you are...
...Shanti Niwas,
Purshottam Narvekar Road.
He's not very far away.
- Let's go guys.
Yes, Avinash.
Sir, the location has shift.
I think he's jumping the IP address.
We've lost him.
Sir, give me a team...in
the middle of the night...'
'Give me this...give me that...'
And what was the result?
Do you know...Human Rights,
Media, the common man...
The entire world is laughing on us.
When you go out there,
people will laugh at Mumbai Police.
Two live murders were
telecasted on TV back-to-back.
The one you called the
murderer...gets murdered.
And you gave a clean
chit to the one suspected.
Go and arrest that
Rahul Oberoi first.
And make him spill the truth.
Sir, I don't think that Rahul...
You can see the result of
your opinion...outside the window.
Now do as I say.
Grill the one we suspect first.
Yes, sir.
Jai Hind, sir.
Mumbai police...
- Down! Down!
Mumbai police...
- Down! Down!
Sir, let's arrest Rahul.
The Commissioner is right.
Why will Rahul make
the same mistake twice?
Mumbai police...
- Down! Down!
The murderer is someone else.
Who, why and where...
Mumbai police...
- Down! Down!
And finding him is the
real pride of this uniform.
Otherwise...uniforms
can be rented too.
Rahul Oberoi.
CEO and Chairman
of Global Times Network.
He's under the
debt of 4.65 billion.
His main business is news.
And he's got only
one medium of income.
Sensationalizing of news.
And..in order to repay
the debt of 4.65 million..
...one needed a big explosion.
More ratings.
More advertisers, more money.
Simple.
Your honor, first murder;
ACP Sarnaik.
And Rahul knew that ACP
Sarnaik was blackmailing Karan..
...for cover up his wife's murder.
ACP killed on live TV..the
suspicion goes on Karan..
...and ratings to Global
Times Network..excellent.
The second murder
of Karan himself.
Reason..a strong and
bold criminal psychology.
Rahul Oberoi is a hardcore
criminal, a cunning murderer..
...and a big threat to the society.
Theory-theory and more theory.
Whatever the defense
council just said..
...is all based
on some imagination.
Like..a writer's fantasy.
Is there any evidence, any proof..or
any eye-witness to this approach?
Baseless. logic-less. abstract.
My client Rahul Oberoi
completely cooperated..
...with the Mumbai Police
officer in every investigation.
But now..we will not cooperate.
Now,
the law will cooperate with us.
Your honor,
it's a complicated case.
This is not a
chain-snatching case.
""Which can be solved
in a single day.
It takes time to gather evidence,
Ms. Siya.
One of your own officer's
has been murdered.
And you say you need more time.
Every kid in the country is watching
this horrific death on television.
And you say you need more time.
An honest, tax-paying citizen
has been called murderer, psycho.
...and in no time he's
been summoned to the court.
You can't catch the murderer.
And just going around in
circles..to hide your failure.
Our cyber-cell team is working.
- Your cyber cell was clueless.
It was we who told them..that
our systems were hacked.
And why will
Rahul Oberoi help you.
To incriminate himself?
- No, to clear the suspicion on him, Ms. Siya.
Do you have proof?
That's why we want judicial
custody of Rahul Oberoi.
This is not some
chain-snatching case.
...where you can arrest
anyone you suspect.
The Mumbai Police should
do their homework properly.
Is Rahul Oberoi
thier only suspect?
They can't prove him murderer
by calling him 'Murderer'.
Give me a proof..give
me an evidence.
...and you can definitely
take Rahul in custody.
But that will never happen.
Because your entire department.
cannot find a single murderer.
He's always a step ahead of you.
And you just want
to cover-up your failure.
Your honor,
my client deserves his lawful freedom.
The Mumbai Police hasn't presented
any evidence against Rahul Oberoi.
Nor could they prove
any motive of his involvement.
So permission for judicial
custody..is refused.
Suhani, put this piece here.
- No-no..
Poppy..come quickly,
I need your help.
WOW!
That's a big puzzle.
It's so confusing.
You're an expert
in solving puzzles.
Which piece will fit here?
You tell me.
I don't know.
Focus, dear. Focus.
Sometimes the piece is right
before us..but we don't see it.
Got it.
- Yeah.
Thank you, poppy. You're a genius.
Let's play together.
Sometimes the piece is right
before us..but we don't see it.'
We know the connection
between Karan and Sarnaik.
And the connection
between Rahul and Karan.
But what connects Karan,
Rahul and Sarnaik.
Three dots.
...how can you connect them?
Gaitonde.
- Yes, sir.
I want a information.
Hi, baby.
What's the matter?
What brings you here
so early in the morning?
Coffee? Breakfast?
What would you like?
You're defending this case
with your eyes and ears closed, Siya.
Why don't you understand..that Rahul's
involved in this case. he is involved.
Don't you dare shout on me!
I am not shouting.
I am just trying to tell you,
rather explain you..
...that you're making
a big mistake, Siya.
What kind of a job is this
which compels you to help a murderer?
I know such people really well.
These people
have no fear of the law.
They can do anything they
want on the basis of money and power.
And they get someone
like you to save them.
What do you mean 'Like you'?
I genuinely feel
Rahul is innocent.
And I'm trying
my best to defend him.
That's what the law thinks too.
Ranveer, give your mind some rest.
You're going around in circles.
I am going around in circles?
Fine.. Then tell me,
weren't Rahul and Karan best friends?
Rahul owed 12.2
billion to Karan.
12.2 billion.
And that Sarnaik.
Why was he murdered?
Don't you think they
are all connected together?
Ranveer, you're hurting me.
And the thought of this
killer lose is killing me.
Rahul is innocent.
Kabir?
I have proof.
- What proof?
<i>Rem rape case.</i>
Rajni rape case is the only case.
...that links Rahul,
Karan and Sarnaik together.
What is Rajni rape case?
This case is the
pan of this puzzle..
""Which no one bothered to see!
Ranveer, what's this case?
Who is Rajni?
My first client.
Global Times Network's
employee of the year.
She was raped by Rahul and Karan.
- What?
Leave me..
Leave me..
Please let me go, sir.
Please let me go..
Let me go, sir.
Sir, please..
- Come on.
Sir, please..Rahul sir, let me go.
Sir please..
Sir, sorry..please. Let me go.
Sorry, sir.
I really don't get you girls?
You can sleep with your boyfriend.
It's casual.
But, if someone like
us genuinely asks for it..
""Then you get offended.
You slapped me..
Sinplease, sir.
Let me go.. please.
After getting slapped..my mercy has died.
- Please..
Please..
Karan sir, please..
- Look-look..
No..
Either you make love
to us..one-by-one.
Or you really make
it tough for yourself.
Please sir, I have a boyfriend.
I am getting married, sir..please.
That's like a good girl, baby.
Well..now we'll make
a small mistake as well.
No..
Then you can forgive us too.
- No-no-no..
Who's in there?
Open the shutter.
Who's in there?
Open LIP--
Hey..who's there?
Let that poor girl go.
You won't, huh!
I'll go get the police.
Hurry up bro,
this is my second cigarette.
All yours, bro.
Come on, baby..
Sir please, come quickly.
Some girl is being
raped in the garage.
Who is getting raped?
This is not the time for question
and answers. Come with me now.
Two men are raping a girl.
So you should've helped her.
Why did you come running here?
You should've beaten
up those rascals.
You think this is a joke.
That poor girl is in trouble.
And you're wasting time.
Get up! I said get up.
Come..come, inspector.
They were raping her here.
There was a car parked here.
I don't know where it is now.
Maybe it's too late.
I saw it with my own eyes.
- Who's getting raped?
Where is the rapist?
- Here..
Oh no..
Don't just stand there.
Call the ambulance.
We must take her to the hospital.
Go on!
The wound on your body will heal.
But,
I won't rest peacefully until..
...I don't make them pay
for hurting your self-esteem.
Madam, would you
like to talk now, or..
'Rajni told police everything.'
'Mr. Sharma was with her too.'
She star-ted preparing
to drag powerful people..
...like Rahul and
Karan to the court.'
But I want to tell you..
This is going to be a long,
painful, tiring and humiliating case.
Think about it.
When a rape case is
discussed in the court.
...it's not less than
a rape case itself.
Doesn't make a difference to me.
I want justice.
Rather..l want my revenge.
Karan sir, am I disturbing you.
Go on.
You should've broken the
toy after playing with it ,
But you spared it.
And now..the case has been filed.
And they have a lawyer too.
They've a strong witness
So..what to do?
What else..buy out the lawyer.
Sir, not everyone
is cooperative like me.
But Still..l will try.
Call up your Karan sir.
- Of course, sir.
Just a second.
- Yes.
Sir..I've handed over the package.
He likes it.
Yes, he wants to talk to you.
Wants to say thank you.
Here you go, sir.
Did you hear..my thank you?
Your ideals.
...your principles.
It's alright, Mr.
Lawyer..see you at the coun.
Your honor, unfortunately
the punishment for gang-rape..
...in our law is only 10 years.
You must take a
decision which will ..
...eradicate the mentality
of people like Karan and Rahul.
To put the last nail in the coffin
of these two, Karan and Rahul..
...I would like to call the
only eye-witness of this case.
Mr. Bijendra Sharma.
Permission granted.
Sir,
we've have some very bad news.
Last night a fire broke out in Mr.
Sharma's house.
...and he burnt to death.
Burnt to death? So simple?
Mr. Sharma was burnt to death!
There was a short circuit,
fire broke out, and..
Finished.
And then what?
They were acquited.
I lost my first case.
And.. Rajni?
I don't know where she
disappeared to after that.
Karan and Rahul raped
my capability in the court.
They turned a rape
case into consensual sex.
After that I heard that..
Rajni left the city.
But no clue about where she went.
But she's back now..
...and what a comeback.
No judge or lawyer,
no evidence or witness.
She is giving her own judgment.
Let Rahul die if has to.
It will only mean one
less animal on this earth.
We must save Rahul.
Sir.
I want every detail of Rajni
rape case..as soon as possible.
As you wish, sir.
Bloody..

You know poppy,
I finished my homework on time.
Good girl.
Hello.
How are you, Kabir?
I am fine, and you are?
- I am not fine, Kabir.
Because you're not letting
me do my job. - Who's this?
You're a good Police officer,
and I respect you for that.
But I request you..please
back out this 'live-murder' case.
It's not worth it.
Rahul has to die,
and you can't stop it.
Confidence is a good thing,
but over confidence is bad.
Please, I've no interest
in harming you in anyway, Kabir.
Because you have
a beautiful daughter.
...and you have to live for her.
Listen, you sound like
you're an educated guy.
But you're threatening
me like cheap.
Kabir..I've done my
duty of warning you.
Now you must do your
duty as a good father.
Stay away from this case.
You can customize
your phone number..'
...through the IP
address and call anyone.'
And they won't even know
who the hacker is, and where.'
Yes?
Makrand Moghe.
He's not at home right now?
Who are you?
Kabir Deshmukh.
Mumbai Police.
When will he be back?
He'll be back soon.
Can I wait for him inside?
Okay, come in.
Here.
- Thank you.
The wheels of time stopped
spinning for me long ago.
But the tracks of my wheelchair
finally led you to me.
<i>Rem .</i>
Puzzle solved.
Mak's home..and photos of Rahul,
Karan and Sarnaik.
And the guest at home is Rajni.
One can let a guest
like this in his home..
...when she already
dwells in his heart.
Mak is the boyfriend
Rajni wanted to marry.
Revenge, you have many faces.
For the first time
in my entire career..
...my hear-t and mind
are in disagreement.
If I listen to my heart, then
I should let you go as the victim.
If I listen to my mind,
I should arrest you as the culprit.
What should I do?
Gaitonde. - Yes sir.
Send the fingerprints and
all the documents connected..
...to this case to forensics.
Rajni will stay under
house-arrest for the time being.
Gaitonder, I want these
repor-ts..as soon as possible.
Okay sir.
We must trace Mak.
We cannot let Mak
slip out of our hands.
And in the mean time,
keep a watch on Rajni. Okay?
Right.
The case has been solved.
Makrand Moghe,
also known as Mak is the accused.
Mak, who is also the technical
head of Global Times Network.
...planned these murders.
But why did Makrand
Moghe do such a thing?
Revenge.
And the motive for revenge
is linked to a 5 year old case.
Since the matter will
now go to the court.
...we cannot disclose
any more information.
Thank you everyone for your time.
Sir..
""As you saw, ACP Ramesh Sarnaik and
Karan Parek murder case has been solved.""
Unbelievable.
Mak..Rajni's boyfriend.
ACP Kabir Deshmukh.
A humble servant of India's strongest.
and most effective Police Force.
Mumbai Police.
Isn't the Mumbai Police
a little helpless?
Catch him and explain him.
“That I didn't
rape his girlfriend.
I was acquitted.
He's a f**** psycho, God dammit.
What a rascal..striking
from the shadows?
What's the guarantee
of my safety, Kabir?
When are you going
to arrest that rascal, Mak?
Soon.
And you don't worry.
Your safety is our priority.
Priority?
My safety?
Your priority
should be arrest Mak.
That Will
automatically make me safe.
You better do your job Kabir.
Manisha. - Yes, sir.
Please come in.
Manisha,
collect my passport from him.
And book me on the
first flight to New York.
Sure, sir.
And pack my insulin
shots also. - Okay.
Thank you.
And Kabir, make sure you get
me to the airport safe and sound.
I'll talk to your Commissioner.
You do have my number.
Whatsapp me when you get Mak.
And listen.
Don't forward me any cheap jokes.
Oh..
Siya! Siya! Siya!
I didn't know that
I was helping a rapist.
Siya, I am not a rapist.
I know who..and what you are.
But..how can you decide
from such a distance?
I've already decided.
Then...
Here's my resignation letter.
Do you want to spend

You want to pay my bills?

Seems like Rahul Oberoi's

Mak.
Mak. Listen to me, buddy.
We can talk it out.

You can trust me.

I Will take it.
But...please don't kill me man.
Don't kill me.
We won't kill you, Rahul.
We will make
an example out of you.
Siya? You?
Just like you did with our lives.
'What is it?'
'1211.'
'Rahul, are you watching?'
Hi, Rahul.
What the f*** Siya?
You too.
No Rahul, just me.
How have I harmed you?
Oh, but you did.
What?
Short circuit, Rahul.
Short circuit.
It didn't just happen...it
was made to happen.
And the person who
died...wasn't just a witness.
He was my father.
Dad, you've to be careful.
They are very powerful people.
If everyone gets intimidated...
...then people like Rahul
will commit rape, murder...
...and anything else they want.
I must step up...so that they
are scared of people like us.
I am proud of you, dad.
You people.
Sorry, sir.
We showed up uninvited.
Sharma sir,
we won't waste much of your time.
We just came to say sorry.
Dad.
We're sorry that...we'll
have to kill you.
Dad!
People like you never
achieve anything in life.
No success,
no fame or achievement.
But then you think of achieving
something in this old age.
You want to become a celebrity
by sending us to jail.
Dad!
Dad!
Stop it your rascal.
We'll douse that
fire of activism in you...
...once and for all.
Please leave him! Please!
Stop it.
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- Stop it.
Help. Anybody there!
Dad..
Help. Anybody there!
Help.
Stop it please.
Anybody there? Help!
Leave him!
Dad!
I saw my dad...die
right before my eyes.
And now...the world's
going to witness your death.
On your channel.
Mak has abducted Rahul.
At any cost we've to stop
this murder from going live.
Use the best brains.
Do whatever you have to do.
Blow up the satellite...shutdown
their entire station if you have to.
We have to stop this. - Okay, sir.
How did Mak get to Rahul?
He's a sharp mind...Rahul Oberoi.
My foot.
I planted Mak in your office.
She tried to commit suicide,
but survived.
But ..she's as good as dead.
So..what should we do now?
Mourn for them.
...or make an example
out of those responsible?
I kept track
of all your movements.
I exchanged your insulin
shots with sugar syrup.
In your efforts to
get me in your bed..
...you just walked
up to your own grave.
Guys.
Orders from the government.
We've to shut down.
Okay sir.
Rahul.
This is highly
concentrated sugar syrup.
No, Siya.
Siya you can't do this.
We will gradually
inject this in your body.
Siya, don't do this.
Your sugar levels
will star-t increasing.
And there will come a time""
...when your body won't be
able to tolerate the sweetness.
Siya.
Siya, don't.
All the toxic elements..will
go to your brain.
And then..you will in
a state of diabetic coma.
Rahul.
It's time for
your television debut.
Siya.
I think the GTN frequency
cannot be hacked.
I think they got us.
Well done, Kabir.
Smart.
But how can
you..stop him from dying.
Sir.
I've found some new
information from the court.
""About the Rajni rape case.
It also has details..on Sharma,

We need your law school
to cooperate the law-keepers here.
Alright.
- Right, thank you.
Your mail ID is?
- It's admin
Thank you.
Gaitonde,
this case is like an onion.
Peel one layer off..and
there's another.
I can't understand.
Ankita is equal to Siya.
Siya is equal to Ankita.
Maybe this is the last layer.
We need to catch Siya.
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you!
Siya, where the hell are you?
I've been trying
to call you for so long.
Ranveer..l want
to take you somewhere.
You didn't say a word throughout.
Now this place.
What's so special
Siya..about this place?
Do you love me, Ranveer?
What?
How much do you love me?
Siya..
- How much?
I love you so much that.
...I can kill or give
up my life for you.
My dad's as well?
Are you alright?
What are you blabbering?
Brijender Sharma was my father,
Ranveer.
Brijender Sharma?
- Yes.
Sarnaik,
Karan, RahuLthey all knew him.
So I killed them all.
Right here.
You can give your life for me,
Ranveer.
But I love you a lot.
I can spare your life.
Just do one thing.
Admit to your crimes.
Handover yourself to the law.
You only told half the story
about Rajni rape case to Kabir.
Now complete it.
Tell him the truth.
Even I will admit to my crimes,
Ranveer.
Go to jail..for what?
I didn't work this
hard to rot behind bars.
I was a poor lawyer,
struggling my way through.
I wanted to move up in life,
and who doesn't?
Whatever I did,
I only did it for my career.
And who the hell is Kabir?
Why should I confess to him?
I'll tell you.
Did you hear..my thank you?
It's alright, Mr.
Lawyer. We'll meet in court.
Karan sir, you should've
made a more fitting offer.
We respect you, Kabir.
We never met a talented
lawyer like you.
But what's the
use of such honesty?
A flat..10 million..and a car.
And your life will be set.
That it?
Is that all you respect me?
Oh, sir..
Your offer tells me that
you don't respect me at all.
<i>My scorner has
s"""""""" my waver-back.</i>
If you win the case.
...you'll catch your
chartered plane to Hawaii.
Won't you?
Once in Hawaii,
you will relax in a big penthouse.
Even I deserve a small
sea-facing penthouse.
And if you win the case..which
I don't think you will.
But if you do..you will
make at least a billion or two.
Oh my God.
I at least deserve 100 million,
with due respect.
Tell me your plan,
Well..
...just stop that witness
from coming to the court.
And I will control my emotions.
Your dad had to die.
Wouldn't they have thought about
it, if I hadn't given them that idea?
Of course.
But I didn't know he was your dad.
If I had known you,
if we had been in love...
...you think I would've
let your dad die?
No way, Siya. No way.
Back then I just
grabbed the opportunity.
I tried to keep you away from Rahul,
because I knew what a rascal he is.
I love you always, Siya.
Forgive me for your dad,
it was not my fault.
Sometimes we've to do
these things in our profession.
Everyone does it.
And yes...
Please stop lecturing me about.
Surrender to the
law' and 'Face the truth'.
What is this, Siya?
We've our entire life ahead of us.
You don't get it, Ranveer.
I don't want to live with you.
I can't spend a moment
with my dad's murderer.
Why bring someone
who's dead between us?
I am apologizing to you?
You want forgiveness.
Fine...I'll forgive you.
But please Ranveer,
admit your crime.
Like father like daughter.
Don't you get a simple thing
that everything will be ruined.
Your father died because
of his obstinacy, and so will you.
Take my dad's name with respect,
Ranveer.
You just have to surrender
yourself to Kabir.
Surrender?
Don't forget that
you're a lawyer as well.
And what do you think?
I will get punished
if I surrender.
For that you need proof,
or I will have to confess.
And I won't.
You don't have to confess.
Meaning?
I mean...you've already confessed.
Cut the phone, Siya.
I say cut the phone Siya, or else...
Or else?
Or else what?
You will kill me too.
If I have to.
""I fell deeply in love with you...""
""The reason is you.""
""The reason is you.""
Kabir, you're mistaken.
She killed Rahul,
Karan and Sarnaik.
You do the wrong
deeds...and I am mistaken.
Surrender yourself, Ranveer.
Surrender myself?
<i>I see...</i>
It will take me less
than an hour to get out.
Only time will tell...
We're two sides of the same coin,
Ranveer.
But you lost the toss today.
Game over.
""The reason...l feel
overwhelmed every season...""
""The reason is you.""
""The reason is you.""
I can't believe this Ranveer.
But I will live with this truth...
...that you're the reason
for all my crimes.
Sometimes we've to
live with pain, Siya.
There's good news for you.
Your case has been closed.
You could've
have arrested me, Kabir.
I listened to my hear-t instead.
I did what I thought was right.
Can you continue doing
your job with this burden?
I resigned.
Now I'll spend
some time with Suhani.
And open up a private
security firm or something.
How is Suhani?
- She's fine.
And she's the main
dancer in the concert now.
Good.
I pray to God that every
father has a daughter like you.
You're a good dad, Kabir.
You're a better daughter.
""The reason...l feel
overwhelmed every season...""
""The reason is you.""
""The reason is you.""
""I was shattered in pieces...but
I feel complete now...""
""I strolled down
your lane every day.""

In the 1920s, Mangatram ""Manga"" is an uneducated, jobless young man who dreams of joining the Police Force but fails at every attempt made to do so. During a visit to the village Naku Guda for his friend Heera's wedding, Manga comes across Sargi and falls in love with her, but being jobless Manga is unable to move forward with his relationship with Sargi.

Manga was born with a unique ability that he could cure anyone's back-ache with a simple kick to the buttocks. One day he manages to cure Englishman Mark Daniel of his back-ache using the same technique. Impressed, Mark offers him a job in the Police Force, which Manga happily accepts. Manga is convinced that since he has a job now, Sargi's family won't object to his marriage with her and so he approaches Sargi's grandfather Lalaji. But Lalaji, who is a follower of Mahatma Gandhi, refuses the proposal because Manga is working for the British, the very people against whom the people of the Naku Guda are fighting for their freedom.",1002,NA,NA,NA

Teen Thay Bhai is the story of three brothers separated for many years and reunited by their grandfather's will.

The story starts with an introduction of three brothers. The eldest, Chixie Gill is a small-time shop owner with 3 obese daughters whom no one wants to marry and a nagging wife (whom he would like to send back to her parents' house). He dreamed of opening a big cloth store in his younger days, but their grandfather was not ready to sell their village land for the money needed. The middle brother, Happy Gill, is a dentist who has only one diagnosis for any tooth ailment: shifting pain. As a result, he has no patients but a long line of creditors (whose teeth he has removed more than once). He wants to get rid of all his debts and open a big dry-cleaning shop. He was in love with Gurleen Kaur in his younger days when they got separated. The youngest, Fancy Gill, is an aspiring actor who wants to go Hollywood but only gets roles in Punjabi cinema, where his habit of putting in disco and English dialogues leads to him being thrown out quite often.

On the death of their grandfather, by the requirement of his will, they need to get together for 3 years on the day of his death anniversary before midnight at the cabin. If not, the property around the cabin (worth crores of rupees) will be forfeited. Also, every year one of them has to take care of their grandfather's ashes, starting from the eldest, and pass it on to the next younger on that day. They somehow manage to make it through two years for the much-needed money, but the last year holds a lot for them. Snowstorms, trespassers, foreign babes with drugs, etc. bring them close to each other and make up their differences.",1715,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt1867070.srt","'Listen. Listen.'

Have some mercy.
We have spent two years peacefully.
Let us spend this

They don't. They don't.
Boys don't have any honour.

Not just you alone but my dreams..
..have been shattered as well.
l have lost all hopes
along withthe property.
We lost the property?
why are you sayingthat, Happy?
All my dreams will be over.
- Shut up.
This has happened
because of yourfoolishness
You are just as quarrelsome.
lf you hadn't quarrelled
about that shortie being a spy.
..then this chaos
would have never occurred,
And this fool wouldn't have got
an opportunity to use his brains
Why are you yelling at me?
You two were enjoying
the stuffed-bread as well.
You should have given
us some poison as well..
..then at least we
wouldn't have seen this day.
l am sure to be defamed.
You are concerned
only about your respect.
what about my respect?
-what respect do you have?
Auseless, fake doctor.
And a wandering street-performer.
l am a street..
lf l am a
street-performerthen you didn't..
..become abig businessman
with your drawstring shop either.
And what respect are
you talking about?
You left your respect back
at the village 20 years ago.
l haven't heard any less
stories ofyour respect either.
Youwere caught nude
with a girl. Brother!
Bravo! Bravo!
Now abuse me as well.
Forsake whatever little
respect you have for me
Have you done
anythingthat an elder does?
You wouldn't have run away
ifyou really were an elder.
Stop your nonsense.

Grandpa was right.
You ran away from
your responsibilities
Responsibilities? You
two were burdens for me.
Burdens.
what else could l have done?
Washed yourclothes all my life
Great. Great, brother.
Now l know how selfish
you have always been.
l thought about moving

But no.
He had to raise you two.
You were a leach.
And you.
Father's last mistake
You dropped in as well.
You ruined my life.
Yes. Yes, l ruined your life
And yours.

Yes, yes, you did it.

Why shouldn't l?
One brother left me to rot
andthe other.. - Otherwhat?
How did l ruin you?
- ln everyway.
You ruined everything.
lf l ruined everything. Happy,
then you could've rectified it.
why didn't you look for her?
- Don't change the topic.
This isthe topic, Happy.
You didn't look for her.
Because you didn't have the courage
And every time you simply cursed me.
Yes l did.
-why?
Yes l did.
-why?
Because.. l hate you.
And youtoo.
Not as much as l hate you two.
So, what have youthought?
Will you admit your crimes?
Why are you crocking like
a rooster in the morning?
l said we didn't commit any crime
All three brothers

l am asking forthe last time..
..do you admit your crimes or not?
Why are you repeating..
what.. No, no.
Not that.
- Do you admit your crime or not?
No, not that.
Do you admit or not?
Gabru!
lf youtouch brother again..
Such brotherhood.
lf he doesn't then
you will admit it?
l will teach all of you.
There isn't a single criminal..
..who didn't admit
defeat before Gabru Bawra.
Kick them, punchthem,
make their plight bad.

Suraj (Randeep Hooda) is an ex-boxer who does multiple jobs to earn as much money as possible, but lives a lonely life in Malaysia. During his new job as a parking attendant, he ends up meeting Jenny (Kajal Aggarwal) a blind and cheerful girl who is surviving in the city all alone. They soon become friends and a chemistry sparks between the two. Suraj's old coach Om (Mamik Singh) calls him back to the club but Suraj tells him that he has stopped fighting. He reveals that three years ago, during a boxing match his opponent's wife begged him to lose as she needed the prize money for her daughter's treatment. In order to help, Suraj loses the fight intentionally but later discovers that it was all a plot set by the opponent boxer. After trashing him in a night club, Suraj loses his boxing license and also stops trusting or caring for anyone. He later, started working as a recovery agent but during one such recovery case, a man jumps out of his apartment window down on the road, leading to a car crash. Suraj has to serve 2 years in jail and since then has been taking care of the treatment of that man.

Back to the present, Suraj now falls in love with Jenny and wants to express his love to her, but on reaching her house finds Jenny's boss harassing her. Suraj beats him up, at which Jenny gets mad as she feared losing her job. Suraj promises to take care of her and takes her home. He proposes to Jenny and asks about her parents. Suraj is then shocked to discover that Jenny's blindness and her parents deaths are due to the same car crash 3 years ago. Weighed down with guilt, Suraj decides to get Jenny operated but needs 300,000 rupees within a month. Suraj, who has already returned to part-time boxing asks for help from his coach.

Suraj's old rival Sikandar offers him to join an illegal fight club, where the owner Gavin (Yuri Suri) pays him 300,000 to lose a fight. Om tries to stop Suraj as this kind of fights may lead to fighter's death or permanent handicap. During the fight Sikandar provokes him and Suraj beats him up. Angered Gavin gives Suraj a last chance to pay back by delivering a bag of drugs. While Jenny is being operated in hospital, Suraj delivers the package only to be run over by Sikandar's car, leading to severe spinal injury. After getting her eyes back Jenny is disappointed upon not seeing Suraj and thinks he has abandoned her. 6 months later, Jenny is working at the same hospital as a physiotherapist, where Suraj is getting treated but doesn't recognize him. Suraj too doesn't reveal his identity to Jenny, because of his paralytic condition. On being able to walk with crutches, Suraj decides to finally confess his feelings to Jenny but seeing her with another man, assumes that she has moved on. Suraj walks away with a heavy heart and visits the place were they both used to spend time together. While searching for Suraj, Jenny reaches the same spot and they unite.",2933,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt4857886.srt","I have reached.

You took so much of time
on the first day, itself?
I'm sorry!
It is very difficult to
do a double shift in this old age.
And you? You do three shifts!
What will you do
with so much money, son?
I have debt that has to be repaid.
Your wish!
Take this key.
My life of double
shifts is now finished.
All the best, son! All the best.
'What a strategy!'
'He ducks,
he misses, and reminds him again.'
'Wow! What a fight!
Oh, another one! What a fight!'
'Oh! He's getting a hold!'
'Woah! And that's a...'
'What a kick! I think,
the match is going to end very soon.'
Hey guard, working or sleeping?
Idiot!
'It's almost a one sided match!'
Hey! Why did you turn it off?
Change the channel!
It must be almost
in 8 o'clock in India.
Please, put on my channel.
What is this?
You still haven't watered this?
I told you,
this has to be watered twice a day.
How many times have I told you?
As soon as it's almost 8 o'clock
in India, turn on my channel.
When will you understand?
Take this!
Take it!
What are you waiting for?
Catch it!
Now, what was the
need to bring all this...
It's your favorite carrot pudding,
uncle Usman.
Now, how many times have
I told you not to play with fire?
But, you?
just blah- blah- blah- blah- blah!
If the lecture is over,
taste it and tell me how it tastes?
Here, come on!
I don't like sweets.
Who are you?
What are you doing
in uncle Usman's cabin?
Uncle Usman has retired
today and I joined in his place.
Oh!
You're a native.
Strange fool you are!
Couldn't you tell me before?
You didn't give me a chance!
I will go to uncle Usman's
house and set him right!
Who just goes away without informing?
First of all, uncle Usman
is not here and to top it...
I don't know whether Bindiya's
mother-in-law will agree or not.
Mother-in-law?
She is very strict!
Poor Bindiya was just
about to apologize.
Now, her fat mother-in-law knows
she was lying to go to the office!
Who is Bindiya?
""I am the Bindiya (ornament)
of your forehead!""
It's the biggest hit
on Indian television.
Don't you watch it?
That's what uncle Usman
and I used to watch together.
Today, he ditched me!
Anyways,
if uncle Usman is not here, then...
I think I should leave, right?
Okay!
I think I should go.
If you wish you can come inside.
No, thanks! I'm fine.
The weather is bad and...
Bindiya should have
reached home by now.
- And her mother-in-law...
- Fat and strict!
I don't know how she's going to react.
What is her mother-in-law's name?
Kalavati!
'Kalavati is the name
of truth and the idol of love.'
'You have cheated Kalavati!'
'Cheated! Cheated!'
'Cheated! Cheated!'
'But, you forgot that
Kalavati wears glasses...'
so that if someone tries
to throw dust into her eyes...'
'the dust collides with
the glasses and falls to the ground!'
'The bond of mother-in-law and
daughter-in-law is a fragile wall...'
'but, you have kicked
down the wall of belief!'
'No, mother!
I haven't done anything of the sort.'
'I value the honor of this
family even more than my life!'
'Please forgive me!'
'The Suryavanshi family...'
'...then Kalavati will
not fail even once!'
'I am the Bindiya of your forehead!'
You haven't eaten this!
And one more thing.
I am telling you because
uncle Usman is not here.
This night jasmine has
to be watered twice a day.
Yes.
Can I get the address
for gym Thunderstorm?
Thank you.
Okay! So now, the structure we make,
needs a strong base.
While learning clay modeling,
we need to start with the base...
which is the armature.
So I hope all of you
are ready to learn...
how to make you first armature.
Yes!
Very good!
So, armatures can be
made of different material.
Like PWC pipes, wooden rods.
Just depends on how sturdy
you want the structure to be.
And you know...
You are so good, Jenny!
I mean, you are so hot!
Thank you, Mr. Chang.
I'm really, really impressed with you.
- What's your plan this evening?
- Me?
Yeah! Of course, you!
You definitely deserve a treat!
But today, Bindiya's husband will
take her on a romantic dinner date.
What?
Sorry, Mr. Chang! I'm busy tonight.
8 o'clock, channel 22!
Do watch it!
Come on! Hit me harder!
Come on, punch harder!
Use your body weight!
Stop!
Mercy is the boxer's biggest enemy!
Your opponent will
never do that for you!
So, box me harder now!
Come on! You can do it.
Use you left! Concentrate! Fight!
What happened?
Look here! Concentrate!
- Suraj!
- What?
I knew you would definitely
come here one day.
Come here you!
Forget about the past, Bossy!
You considered Suraj your own son.
He has returned after 3 years.
Let's hug and start all over again.
Trust me,
everything be like the old times.
Come here! What did you do to me?
Let me show you!
Look here! Look!
Look here!
I had to leave that posh locality...
and come and live here in this area!
I had a home which
I built with my hard work.
It got sold.
My wife loved me a lot.
She left me and returned to India.
All because of you!
And you think that
I will hire you again!
I will trust you again.
I did not come here to ask for work.
I have come to apologize.
Sorry.
You've come here to do me a favor.
Omi! He's come here to do me a favor.
Why don't you say it clearly?
You've come to see...
whether Srikant is still alive.
If he is alive, what is his plight?
Omi! Tell him...
Tell him to get out of my sight.
I never want to see his face again.
Get him out from here.
Get him out!
Suraj, you don't worry.
This guy is very haughty!
But, he loves you.
And his wife was going
to leave him anyway.
Now come on,
I will introduce you to the others.
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, boys! Come on! Come here!
Look who's here! This is Suraj.
We used to call him ""Storm"".
He was the champion in 2012.
There used to be no one left
to face him in the final round.
All the professional
players were defeated by him.
Hey Sikandar, come on here.
Nobody could play until
the last round with him.
That's Storm!
And I was one of them.
He knocked me out in 13 seconds.
Isn't it, Champ?
Sikandar!
Suraj, all these are old stories.
But, he is no less today!
He has worked very hard on himself.
He is the best MMA
fighter in Thunderstorm.
I saw him on TV. Not bad.
Oh, really?
Not bad!
Come on, then! Let's see.
What does good mean
and who is better?
I have given up fighting.
Why?
Have you lost your power?
- Or did you realize your true place?
- Sikander!
This is not the time
for this useless conversation.
He hasn't worn gloves for 3 years.
It will be seen later,
who will win and who will lose.
He gave up winning 3 years ago.
At that time he was the shining sun.
Today, he is the setting sun.
Come on, boss!
Okay, take it. Tell them.
Tell them how much
fire is still left in you.
- Boss, I have given up fighting.
- Boss!
Suraj!
This place is for boxers.
That too, only for winners.
Don't even think of looking this way,
forget about coming here!
Suraj!
'She was looking great!'
'Why dinner tonight?'
'It's nobody's birthday,
nor anniversary!'
'How can you say that, Bindiya?'
'Don't we go out without an occasion?'
If you don't mind,
can you please open the window?
Sorry, but I'm sensitive to smell.
Maybe you've had a work out,
that's why!
What clothes have you worn today?
It's a greenish T- shirt and...
Silly! I'm not talking about you,
I'm asking about Bindiya!
What do her earrings look like?
- Just like you!
- Really?
Wow! Bindiya is wearing
earrings just like mine.
Okay, now look at the TV and
tell me how Bindiya actually looks!
- I'll just be back.
- Okay
'You don't call him a killer,
you call him a murderer!'
'How does it matter whether
he is a killer or a murderer?'
'Will you kill me
now or after dinner?'
'Bindiya! A little romance...'
'My romance is not a joke!'
'I am the bindiya (ornament)
on your forehead'
Thank you! Bye!
Your...
tiffin.
Thanks!
What is inside this?
It's sugar.
What! Why?
- We're equal now.
- Oh, really?
Favor and debt, must be repaid
as soon as possible, Bindiya!
Sometimes, you behave
like Bindiya's husband Jignesh!
Anyway, I'm Jenny!
I'm shaking your hand,
not asking for it!
You are shy like a girl,
but your hand is quite solid.
What do you do?
Okay!
Bye! Thanks for the show.
And thanks for the sugar.
""Sounds! Tell me, what are these
sounds that I can hear nowadays""
""Knocking! Tell me, why are
these strange moments knocking?""
I'm shaking your hand,
not asking for it!
""There is something
that causes less sleep""
""There is something
that makes the eyes moist""
""There is something,
that if you say so""
""I will lay down
my life with a smile!""
""What can we call that
which exists between us?""
""What is love? It is a wave...
Come, let's flow with it together""
- ""Something that makes me lost""
- I'm talking about Bindiya, not you!
""There is something
that you could not sleep!""
""There is something that
both of us laughed until we cried!""
Hi! I'm so late!
Please, put the TV on.
There's water too?
New shoes?
No.
They're pretty old,
bought them quite sometime ago.
Okay.
What is Bindiya going to do today?
She is going to request her husband.
Jignesh is going to leave Bindiya
and go to Singapore for his new job.
Put the TV on, please.
- 'I don't want your money!'
- See? It's already started.
'Why are you crying like this,
darling?'
'I'm doing all this for you.'
'I don't need your money! I need you!'
'No matter what state we are in,
at least we are together.'
'Bindiya will not be able
to live without you, Jignesh!'
'She will die!'
'Bindiya!
Please don't say such things.'
'I will die, before you.'
'My life is tied to yours.'
'Please!'
'What should I do?'
Jignesh is not doing the right thing!
You won't ever do that, right?
'I will be paid twice
as much money in Singapore.'
What does that mean?
That means that you will not
leave your girlfriend for a new job!
'I will work there
and take care of you.'
It depends.
It depends?
What do you mean, it depends?
What is more necessary for you?
Old relationships or a new job?
I will never leave her and go.
Promise?
Promise!
Good!
Your girlfriend is very lucky.
I don't have a girlfriend.
Silly! You don't have one,
but you will one day.
Wherever she is today,
she is very lucky.
Because it's you in her life,
not Jignesh.
Handsome?
Like a typical Gujju guy, tall, fair!
Silly, I'm not talking about Jignesh,
I'm talking about you!
What do you look like?
Tell me.
Don't bluff because I can't see, okay?
People call me rough and tough.
That means you're not very handsome.
Okay, bye!
Ahh! Ouch!
Aww!
Don't move! Are you alright?
Oh no.
How many days since we became friends?
Since Bindiya apologized to
the time Jignesh goes to Singapore.
That means, 6 days.
And you haven't even told
me your name in these 6 days!
Suraj.
Suraj...
Suraj!
Suraj... what?
Suraj Singh Rathore?
Suraj Uday Pratap Chauhan!
What is your full name?
The one who gave me a name,
only gave me this much.
I have never wanted
to have more than that...
nor was it in my destiny
to have more than that.
Wow!
You should be writing the
dialogues of a show like Bindiya.
You narrated your whole
life's history in just one line!
But, don't worry. I don't
know about your life until now...
but from now onwards,
Jenny will never let you...
miss Rathore or Chauhan.
If I have made a friend,
I will be a friend until the end.
Oh, wait, wait, wait!
I cannot walk anymore.
Let me sit down for a while.
There is a bench over there.
You can rest there for some time.
Careful!
- Careful!
- Thanks.
Listen!
If you want you can go home.
I mean, if there is someone
waiting for you at home.
- If you want, I can...
- What can you do?
I mean, I can...
You mean, you will carry me
on your shoulders and drop me home?
Right!
It's not a bad idea.
But, think about it.
You may regret it midway!
Yes, I've thought about it.
Okay!
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Now?
- Have we passed the garage?
Yes.
Now, turn left from here.
Just a little way more.
Have we passed the mosque?
Yes.
Yes, that's gone too.
Then, we've reached.
No, no. I mean almost reached.
See, there is a broken
down beauty parlor on the left.
Yes.
There some stairs just ahead of it.
Yes.
It's above those stairs.
Upstairs?
If you're tired, I'll manage.
That's it.
Can you see that gate on the left?
- Yes.
- We have to go inside there.
Not here! Just one floor above.
What happened?
Are you tired?
You said, you were a tough guy!
Perfect! Just here.
Ouch!
I'll go.
Just a minute.
Can you just do me one last favor?
Please.
There is a cloth stuck here.
A cloth?
It's an innerwear.
Thanks!
One minute!
Here.
Two tickets to the music concert.
Consider it a gift
for dropping me here.
I don't like music.
And there is no one
to go along with me.
I could have gone with you,
but you don't like music, so.
No!
It's not like that.
We can go.
I'll pick you up.
Thank you.
Hi!
Should we go?
""Playing the guitar with twist melody""
""The youngster become impatient""
""The quick and fast rhythm""
The concert is there.
""Their hearts leap with joy""
""Searching for partners""
""What a beautiful rhythm""
""All are welcome to dance""
I have come to a concert
after a long time.
Thank you, Suraj.
There is an Indian
restaurant close by.
I used to go there
with someone special.
My first love!
I don't know whether
it's still here.
Who was he?
Who?
Your first love?
Silly!
I was talking about my dad.
This was his favorite place.
We came here very often.
Enough about me.
Tell me about yourself.
Were you always like this?
Haughty and speaking very little?
The serious kind?
Or did you have a humorous side?
You know, Bindiya says,
that people who speak less...
have a volcano of
memories in them.
They keep on moving
around in those memories.
Do you have anything like that?
You know, Bindiya also says...
people who speak less
are either very nice...
or very evil.
They can die for somebody
or they can kill for them too.
And I have heard that blind people
talk more than necessary!
We lost track of time
while talking.
I need to leave.
Suraj, now you are our only hope.
Sikandar ditched us to
make more money.
Now, forget everything
and come back to us.
Because, if you're in the race,
we're in the race.
These hands will never
be raised on anybody.
I told you, didn't I?
We're wasting our time with him.
If he was one of my own...
he would come at least once to
check on how I am.
He wouldn't have disappeared
for three years after destroying me.
This is not the man
whom I considered my son!
I was in jail.
I was in a jail in Kuala Lumpur
for 2 years and 7 months.
Winning that fight 3 years ago
was not only your dream.
It was mine too!
The date of the fight
is fixed, Suraj.
Just know that I am taking
the biggest risk of my life.
You are confident, aren't you?
Oh come on, boss! If he wants...
he can break anybody's jaws and
put the teeth on a table before you.
Right, Suraj?
Now that you have taken an advance,
then why be scared?
Hey!
The night before the fight
a woman came to me.
My name is Natasha.
And she asked me to lose the fight.
I have only one daughter, Alisha.
She told me that my opponent
Ali's daughter had cancer.
And that if I won the fight...
he would never be able to
get her medical treatment.
Please save her.
Please.
You have come to the wrong address.
Come on, Suraj!
Yeah!
Suraj!
Suraj!
Suraj!
Suraj!
Dad!
Dad! Dad!
Dad!
- Come on, Suraj!
- What is he doing!?
Dad!
Hit him more!
Dad!
One!
I had almost won that fight!
But, when I saw that
little girl's innocent face
I stopped fighting.
I thought, I would have
other fights to win.
But, that little girl had
only one life to live.
Suraj!
Yay! Dad won!
For the first time,
I wasn't sad to lose.
I had saved a life.
Suraj! What was this, Suraj?
Why are you asking him?
He's lost and hiding out here.
You led down the one who
mentored you!
You wanted money, didn't you?
You could have asked me!
I would have given you money.
You have destroyed me!
What are you doing here?
Hey, you!
Don't touch her.
Who are you?
Don't dare touch my kid...
You talk to me,
if you want her, okay?
Then, I realized that all
this was a drama.
Everything inside me
died that day.
I decided, I would
become an evil man.
So evil, that I forgot myself!
After my fighting license
got cancelled...
I started fighting
outside the ring.
I started doing extortion work.
Hey what do you want?
Why did you go to jail?
It was the last night of the year.
Or maybe the first morning of
the new year.
Everybody was welcoming
the new year.
And I was just doing my work.
Don't come close to me.
I give you money.
That's all I have.
I have no more money.
'Foreign language.'
'Foreign language.'
'Foreign language.'
Open the door!
Police!
Open the door!
We have complaints against you.
Open the door!
Open the door!
Open the door!
I still look after him.
So that the wounds on my heart
heal with the wounds on his body.
Suraj, the handicapped children
of my orphanage have made this.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Go give this to her.
The love between you will double.
God bless!
- Celebrate tonight.
- Who is it?
Who's there?
It's me, Jenny darling!
Mr. Chang!
What are you doing here?
I've been waiting for you.
- Let's go!
- Mr. Chang.
I have got my own juice.
- Mr. Chang, please leave!
- You can forget about your juice.
Let us have fun.
I brought for our
special night tonight.
Please leave.
We'll talk in the office tomorrow.
No!
Tonight, you listen to me!
You must stay here
and drink this.
No!
I'll see to it,
that we will party tonight.
Get out! Mr. Chang,
leave!
How dare you insult me?
You never cared about my feelings.
I'll make sure,
you don't do this to me anymore.
Just leave! Get out!
Son of a...
Get out!
Suraj!
Suraj, no!
No!
No!
- Stop it!
- This time I've broken your fingers.
Next time, I'll break
your freaking neck!
Suraj, please stop!
Why did you do that, Suraj?
He's my boss!
Tomorrow, he will tell
the entire management.
I will lose my job!
Do you still want to work with him?
Then what else should I do?
Is there any place in the world...
where a single girl
is not harassed?
Is there any office where
bosses like him don't exist?
Should I leave my job?
Should I give up living my life?
Who will take care
of my expenses?
- I will look after you.
- Why?
Who are you to me?
Who am I to you?
You cannot do anything, Suraj.
Apart from increasing my troubles.
Please, leave me alone.
Please! Leave me alone.

Hi!
Hi!
I thought about it
the whole day and left my job.
Good!
Now, I'm not used to sitting at home.
So, I thought I'd ask you...
will you take me out this weekend?
You said,
you would look after me.
Always!
The orphanage where
I grew up was here.
And then one day, a storm came...
and everything
got washed away.
Now, whenever I'm lonely, or...
I am sad,
then I come here.
Are you lonely and sad
today as well?
No!
For the first time today...
I have come to share
my happiness with this place.
Found it?
Umm-hmm.
Carefully!
Perfect!
Now, this is the foundation
of our home.
Okay? Wait.
These pebbles are the symbol
of the foundation.
Always keep them with you.
They will always remind you of me.
And this, I will always keep with me.
I will also come here to share
my happiness and sorrow.
And you will find me here.
But you didn't want to raise
your hand, right?
Now let it go, my friend.
You son is home,
give him your blessings.
Stop asking useless questions!
I want an answer.
He wants to settle down.
He has fallen in love.
But explain to him
very clearly...
his love should not come
in the way of my boxing.
""Rise! Young lad""
""Blood speaks!""
""Filled in each and every vein""
""passion speaks""
""Rise, young lad. The blood speaks,
the passion in your veins speaks""
""Comes let's make up an iron mind,
and say the word""
""Let's fill the cage
with passion of winning...""
""Let's love the pain""
""Become crazy, take courage to a high
and make all our difficulties easy""
""Stay awake the whole night, dream
with open eyes - this is my curse""
""Make all our difficulties disappear""
""The sweat of blood,
my chest swells with my courage""
This is our new home.
There is a sweet little
balcony over here.
From here...
From where the sunshine
comes straight inside.
How do you know?
I have always seen the sun
without my eyes.
But, the sun has never
looked into my eyes.
Look into my eyes, Suraj.
You are looking into them, right?
Yes.
Lies!
I can see everything
even without sight.
And even though
you have eyes...
'Foreign language.'
The one who will look
after me has arrived.
Now, I can come
every day to help you.
""Rise, young lad. The blood speaks,
the passion in your veins speaks""
""Let's die and let's
say the word""
""Like a heart of iron,
a gypsy who loves pain""
""Become crazy, take courage to a high
and make all our difficulties easy""
""Stay awake the whole night, dream
with open eyes, this is my curse""
""Let's break together and make
all our difficulties disappear""
""The sweat of blood, my chest swells
with my courage""
""Let's break together and make
all our difficulties disappear""
""The sweat of blood, my chest swells
with my courage""
Tell me more.
Suraj!
Okay, Stop! Suraj, no!
Okay. Time out! Time out!
Time out! Turn around!
Looks like you didn't find any
patient in the hospital on Sunday.
Just shut up!
You boxers are
are as good as patients.
You know, your back is really weird.
The curve between
your lumbar spine...
and the thoracic spine
is very little.
So, there is a problem
even with my back!
While massaging, you've begun to
imagine yourself as a doctor!
- Doctor Jenny!
- Obviously!
I'm a qualified nurse.
They won't even let me enter
the hospital without this knowledge.
If we collect some money...
then I could open
a little school for you.
How sweet!
So that you can spend
some time with your art...
and not just with your patients.
Oh! And who will you
spend your time with?
Let me think.
What should I say?
You'll think?
Are you serious?
No.
""The threads of a relationship between
us are beginning to take shape""
""My uneasiness has now begun to
find some peacefulness""
""The threads of a relationship between

""My faith has made me like you""
""You taught me how to live and die""
""My faith has made me like you""
Suraj!
You have done this, right?
How dare you?
Hold this.
I'm sorry!
Silly boy!
We live in Malaysia.
But, we're still Indians.
Who is going to seek permission
from my parents?
Ask them, silly.
I don't speak too much.
I will only say that...
I will keep your
daughter very happy.
You never told me
how they died.
What should I say?
It was the first
night of the New Year.
But for me, that night left behind
a lifetime of darkness.
Dad had stopped all his urgent work
and was with us since two days.
And I was driving.
And then that
fateful accident happened.
But for me, that night left
behind a lifetime of darkness.
My parents always wanted
the best for me.
They worry about me even
though they have gone so far away.
That's why they found you
and sent you to me.
Thanks for coming
in my life, Suraj.
Jenny!
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Jenny Mathias.
Oh! Okay. Ask the doctor.
Okay, thank you, sir.
Excuse me doctor,
I'm with Jenny Mathias.
- Oh, Hi.
- Is she okay?
It was a little cut, not too much.
She was lucky you know,
because the piece didn't dig in.
- Can I take her home?
- Sure!
But remember, next time,
don't leave her alone. Alright?
Okay?
- Thank you, doctor.
- You're welcome.
Oh! Why did you come?
I was about to come home.
It's nothing!
It's just a cut.
It's cornea damage,
causing visual impairment.
But, sight can be restored in
such cases with an operation.
Really?
Yes!
But, you have already
delayed it too much.
What do you mean?
That means, 15 - 20 days.
One month at the maximum.
After that, even this operation
would be useless.
If the operation is done
within a month, then...
can the sight in her eyes
be restored?
Yes, but we will have
to import the cornea from the US.
What will the expenditure be?
Come on, suraj.
Suraj!
Come on.
Come on, breathe!
Breathe!
Defend yourself,
get him on the jaw!
Why don't you elbow him?
Come on! Don't hold back.
Come on!
Come on!
Suraj!
Yes.
- Well done.
- Good job, my boy.
Until Jenny gets her eyes back...
I will keep thinking
about this, Omi.
I need a lot of money for that.
Suraj, who doesn't need money?
But, Srikant is not
in the right shape.
Neither can he help you, nor can I.
But, you can't let that affect
you, friend.
And you will never get
any money fighting for them.
I saw you fighting, not bad.
One should not be angry with a man
who sells his soul for money...
one should pity him.
I trained him for 2 years.
But, he still left and joined
Gavin's club for money.
Let's see how long
he stays there.
I got what I didn't get in 2 years,
within 2 weeks.
When you are fed up of
fighting this small fights...
and feel like fighting
with a real man...
then come to me.
You will get money.
And all your desires
will also be fulfilled.
Think about it, there will be pain.
Jenny will be more hurt,
if she touches it.
Your wish!
I was thinking about you.
I've told you so many times not to
do all this work when I am not home.
But, I can't get anything done
when you are around.
Suraj! What happened?
Are you alright, Suraj?
What happened?
Nothing.
Oh! I'm absolutely fine.
100%.
If I could see...
would you still lie to me like this?
I knew you would come.
I didn't know
it would be that soon.
Drink.
I need money, Sikandar.
It is need that takes
a man to his destination.
Tell me, what is your need?
300,000.
That's all? If you work
at Gavin's club...
then your needs will be
fulfilled in 3 or 4 months.
Jenny doesn't have
that much time, Sikandar.
I need that money in 15 days.
Gavin never gives such a big advance
even to family!
Sit!
Look, now the matter
is about love.
So Sikandar
will have to do something.
If you need a bigger rate...
then you have to do a bigger job.
I will do it.
Cheers!
Why are you crying?
Okay dear, sorry!
I shouldn't have brought you here.
I'm not crying because
of that, silly!
Then?
I'm crying because you didn't bring
me to such a nice place before!
Come on, let's do it again!
Single ticket, double fun! Come on!
What happened?
The fun would actually have doubled,
if only you were able to see.
You are my eyes!
Come on.
You knew that the operation
would have cured your sight.
What's happened to you?
Come on!
You knew that the cornea
could be imported from the US.
Yes, I knew! But, I also knew...
that it would be impossible to
collect so much money. Let's go.
You could have told me at least.
What's happened to you?
Why are you wasting so much time?
The park will close. Come on!
The doctor has said that...
you have only 15 - 20 days.
- Don't you want...
- No, I don't want.
I don't want to see a world
where my mom and dad don't exist.
Wherever your parents are, they...
will be very sad.
Imagine, how happy they will be,
if you can see again.
And don't you want to
see this silly guy's face?
But where will we get
so much money from?
Work!
Can you take a life?
Sorry!
Can you give your life?
There is freestyle in Langkawi.
Will you play?
That's why I'm here.
But, you have to fight to lose.
And there is no need to tell you
that it is completely illegal!
If you get caught,
the entire responsibility is yours...
and only yours.
I am thinking,
that if I get my sight back...
then we will go to that
lake first.
Where I've laid the
foundation of our home.
Then, I will look at Oscar.
I will look at the sunset,
I will look at the water in the lake.
And me?
I would have already seen you, silly!
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.
Suppose I don't turn out like you...
How?
- The way you think I am.
- How do I imagine you?
I mean... you know... like...
You mean, the silly
and ugly types?
- You'll be terribly disappointed!
- Really?
Because, neither am I ugly,
nor am I silly!
'One more thing...'
'if you don't want your
family to land in any trouble...'
'then you have to destroy every
identification that you have.'
'Even your family's life can be
endangered in such illegal fights.'
'So destroy every identification
of yours before you leave.'
'So that nobody can trace you.'
'You will get a new name and
passport within two days.'
'You will never leave your
girlfriend for a new job?'
'Promise?'
You've gone out of your mind!
Will you fight for that
ungrateful, Gavin?
- Just this once!
- Oh, really?
And what if you're finished
during that one time?
Suraj, the fight
you're talking about...
has 6 out of 10 fighters dying.
The rest are crippled for life.
Otherwise also, I'm not alive
in the real sense of the word!
I cannot bring
back Jenny's parents.
But, if I can bring back
her sight, perhaps...
my guilt will be a little less.
And about having
broken arms and legs...
I am a cripple now, brother.
Your love has finally
gotten in the way!
Actually, love has saved me, Omi!
Take care of yourself.
Can I say something, Suraj?
When the bandage
on my eyes is opened...
don't come in front
of me immediately.
I don't want to suddenly come face to
face with the biggest joy in my life.
And I also want...
that you should be with me
when my sight is restored.
Will you be there, Suraj?
Promise me!
What are you thinking? Promise!

Your new phone with new sim card.
'Foreign language.'
Cheating with me...
Normally I don't like
to dirty my hands.
But I know when I have to.
Now won't you say,
that's why you came.
To die.
I hope you remember that.
Take him away!
Get him ready for the fight.
7 minutes!
You have 7 minutes to die.
What to do? The rules of
the game are like this.
This fight does not stop until
either man's breath's stops.
And your breath is
mortgaged with me.
From now on each breath of
yours will dance to my tunes.
7 minutes!
You will make this game
interesting for 7 minutes.
And then you can
prepare to lose.
That means, get ready to die!
But you are a very lucky man, Suraj.
Because, your fight
is not with an enemy.
But, with your best friend.
So cheer up, come on!
Soup for you.
Did Suraj call?
No.
Nurse, please check again.
He must have surely called!
Hit me.
Come on, hit me man.
'For 7 minutes you will
make this game interesting.'
'And then you can prepare to lose.'
'Get ready to die!'
What an amazing girl she must be...
if you're ready to
give your life for her.
Your sacrifice and
her youth won't go in vain.
I will take care of her.
Yes!
Yes!
Wait!
He came here to die anyway.
But, our loss will not be fulfilled...
by his death his life will do it.
And this time you better do it right!
'I give you one more
chance to live your life.'
'And if my goods do not reach intact.'
'Be ready to lose
your life this time.'
- Suraj?
- No!
Take care.

I have to admit your designs

Thank you, but this work is
done by the children of the institute.

You are the one teaching these kids.
Anyway, I own a fitness club.

When I see you so happy,
I am sure of one thing.

Anyway, friends?
Friends!
Excuse me.
Hello!

Okay!
Hi! I'm Jenny.
Won't you say something?
He has not spoken...
one word until now.
Okay! Let's see your case.
Muscle Spasm.
The recommended treatment...
for your case is a massage.
Let me check.
Your leg muscles are pretty weak.
It looks like you've been
in a very big accident.
Let me see, if you need
traction for your back.
May, I turn you?
Easy. Easy.
Okay.
Your back muscles
have deteriorated!
Sarfaraz Ahmad.
But don't worry,
you'll be fine.
You'll be back running around,
like you were earlier.
Actually you know,
I am not a doctor.
But, I have learnt
physiotherapy.
If destiny had been with me...
I would have had a physiotherapy
centre of my own.
Anyways, I'll be coming
every weekend.
And this is my card.
So call me,
if you need me earlier.
Take care.
Don't worry,
you'll be fine.
Bye!

Great. Pleasure working with you.
With you as well.
Excuse me.
Can you do me a favor?
There are no favors
in friendship, just order.
I'm getting late. Will you just take
care of my shop for 5 minutes?
- Sure!
- I'll just go across and get some...
medicines for Romeo.
Romeo?
My turtle.
Romeo, Romeo! If only my parents
had given me such a lovely name.
- Then, you would have crawled, too!
- I'd do what you wanted me to.
How stupid!
Come on, Oscar.
Let's go baby, come.
May I help you?
Are you looking out for something?
Night Jasmine.
It only blooms at night.
It's available only at
our shop in this whole area.
Storm?
Should I pack it?
I'll just pack it for you.
Oscar, wait! Oscar!
Oscar!
What are you doing?
Behave yourself. I am sorry.
Really, sorry. He normally
doesn't behave like this.
I don't know what happened to
him! Oscar, come on!
May I help you?
Yeah!
Are you okay?
You are?
Aren't you the same man,
that patient from the hospital?
Should I drop you somewhere?

Not bad. One second.
Where's Romeo?
Did somebody come here?
The man with the crutch?
Yes!
He was the one who
bought the night jasmine.
You know what?
I almost mistook him as
one of my favorite boxers.
Storm!
But I felt it was him.
But, he didn't react when
I called him by that name.
You know what?
I'm sure it was him.
I was looking at him,
but he didn't hear me at all.
Silly boy!
Suraj!
Suraj!
Suraj!
Suraj!
Hello!
Dr. Kidwai.
Hi! This is Jenny.
Doctor, I need to know about
that patient on bed number 13.
Yes, Sarfaraz.
What happened?
What happened to Sarfaraz?
What?
He left yesterday?
Suraj!
You done so much
for me quietly.
Now, when it's my turn...
you let go of my hand
and were going away.
It's all the fault of these eyes.
I could read a man
without my eyes, but...
I couldn't recognize him when
I could see him in front of me.
Why?
Why did you do this to me?
Why?
Because, I'm silly and ugly.

This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (September 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message)

The film is set in the fictional Indian city of Bharat Nagar which is considered an example of progress through infrastructure. The state government is planning to build an International Business Park (IBP), which is claimed to turn the city into 'Shanghai.'

The film starts with Bhagirath ""Bhaggu"" Dolas (Pitobash Tripathy) convincing his maternal uncle, Jagannath ""Jaggu"" Koli alias (Anant Jog) into performing an unknown task. Although unwilling, the latter takes it up fearing confiscation of his hypothecated vehicle due to possible issues in unpaid dues. Bhaggu then participates in the assault of a local bookstore owner who stocked copies of Dr. Ahmadi's (Prosenjit Chatterjee) latest book, which criticises Morcha, the local political party, for ignoring the plight of the poor in its quest for developing infrastructure. Ahmadi, a socialist academic, is scheduled to visit Bharat Nagar for a speech. Shalini (Kalki Koechlin), a former student of Ahmadi, is part of a small group that struggles to raise awareness against the much touted project, which could render many people homeless. Joginder Parmar alias Jogi (Emraan Hashmi) works in a photo and video studio of questionable repute with the owner, Vinod (Chandrahas Tiwari). T. A. Krishnan (Abhay Deol), an IAS officer, a favourite of the Chief Minister (Supriya Pathak), is assured by Principal Secretary Kaul (Farooq Shaikh) of a promotion and a trip to Stockholm.

Ahmadi arrives from New York City to find out that the required permissions for his speech have been revoked (due to Krishnan's influence) citing lower police protection. Before his arrival, Shalini gets a warning from Gauri, her maid, to stop him from coming to Bharat Nagar, but her words are not taken seriously by his associates. Jogi and Vinod are present at the Morcha party headquarters to shoot a promotional video on IBP featuring Janardhan Purshottamdas Sawant alias Deshnayak (Kiran Karmarkar), a local politician. On receiving a call, Deshnayak becomes flustered, and Damle, his aide, tells the duo to stop the shoot.

Meanwhile, Ahmadi finds a way to deliver a scathing speech against the establishment, which is received well. A mob later gathers and attacks his associates. On learning this, Ahmadi gets angry and starts shouting at the police officers managing the crowd. Unknown to the police, Jaggu's truck breaks in and runs over Ahmadi. One of Ahmadi's team members, Tiger, tries to intervene by jumping onto the truck and fighting Bhaggu, who was behind the truck. In the scuffle, Bhaggu is pushed off and manages to escape. Sometime later, Jaggu crashes his vehicle. This is noticed by a policeman nearby, and he is subsequently arrested. Jogi and Vinod were also present to cover Dr. Ahmadi's speech.

Ahmadi winds up comatose in a hospital. Shalini is confident that this was a planned attack. On seeing Jogi in the hospital, she asks him if they have any video footage of the crash, which could be used to find the perpetrators. Dr. Ahmadi's wife Aruna (Tillotama Shome) agrees to lead a media campaign demanding the truth, though she seems uninterested. Bhaggu meanwhile manages to free his uncle from prison.

Back in the studio, during a conversation with Jogi, Vinod claims to have incriminating evidence against Morcha and wishes to sell Shalini the tape. Meanwhile, Aruna's campaign forces the CM's office to set up an inquiry commission headed by Krishnan. Krishnan finds that the police are hiding evidence, so he summons SSP Chavan (Chinmay Mandlekar), who is also uncooperative. Shalini, who attends the commission snaps at Krishnan for allegedly taking it lightly, following which she is barred from attending any future hearings. Jogi, desperate to sell the tape futilely approaches Krishnan but is later approached by Shalini.

Shalini meets Vinod but leaves when Vinod says that he won't give the video for free. While she changes her mind later at night, she calls Jogi, who is shown to be in an ambulance with Vinod's wife, but in vain. Vinod is found dead in what looks like a road accident. At a later Morcha rally where Jogi is in the ambulance with Vinod's corpse, Damle approaches him and mentions the tape, subtly threatening him. Though initially reluctant, Jogi promises to help Shalini and Tiger in finding the evidence. He then attends a rally held by Deshnayak, on the occasion of his birthday. The three then rummage through the footage to find the conspirators, compile a CD and hand the evidence to Krishnan. In one of Deshnayak's rallies, Bhaggu and his uncle approach Damle over not releasing the truck involved in the accident, not paying Bhaggu's fees for his English classes, and not answering his calls. An irate Bhaggu threatens to spill the beans over Dr. Ahmadi's murder, following which Damle promises to sort everything out.

After viewing the evidence on the CD, Krishnan sends out a summons to Deshnayak, who rejects it in a public rally (where Bhaggu approaches Damle) sparking riots in the city. Shalini visits Jogi who is about to leave town. Meanwhile, Morcha thugs attack the studio while trying to search for Jogi. Jogi and Shalini manage to escape and hide on the roof until morning. In the chaos of the riots, Bhaggu, who is a part of the instigators is later found dead, ostensibly killed by Damle's men over the spat over releasing Jaggu's truck.

Shalini receives a panicked call from Gauri, who says that her family is in danger. Shalini and Jogi sneak over to Gauri's place, where it is revealed that Jaggu is Gauri's father. An angry Shalini starts beating Jaggu, who later opens up about the events of the crime. Jogi then remembers that Vinod had kept a backup of the incriminating tape, and sneaks back to the studio to get it. Krishnan meets with the Chief Minister about the inquiry. Jogi finds the CPU amid the studio's wreckage and has a narrow escape from the thugs chasing him. They all show Krishnan the video, which establishes that Deshnayak conspired to have Ahmadi killed and the Chief Minister was complicit in this plan.

The Chief Minister, buoyant because she has an opportunity to eventually become Prime Minister, presents Krishnan with the approval of his Stockholm trip, and a promotion. She also asks Krishnan to stop the probe and hand over all his findings to the CID of the State Police, which shall now investigate the case further. However, after seeing the evidence, Krishnan confronts Kaul with the truth, who then threatens to ruin Krishnan's career. Undeterred, Krishnan blackmails him, until Kaul finally leaves to talk to the Home Minister's secretary. In the hospital, Ahmadi's family decide to take him off life support.

An epilogue explains the fate of the major characters: Krishnan refused the chance to go to Stockholm to ensure that a national investigation is opened up as per his plan. Jogi escaped Bharat Nagar as a pornographer but is declared untraceable by the police. Shalini wrote a book about the conspiracy, which is banned in India. In the closing scene, a poster is shown carrying Aruna's picture with the slogan, ""Chief Minister for all, IBP for all,"" implying that she is contesting for the CM's designation, and supports the IBP project. Jaggu is shown operating a bulldozer for demolishing old homes to make way for the business park. As Jaggu prepares to demolish the house, Dr. Ahmadi is shown turning toward him, which signifies Jaggu's trauma after the accident or the academic's futility in stopping the project.",7711,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt2072227.srt","In Army...

Savitri Rao, a widow, hopes that her only son, Vishwas, will grow up to be a brave inspector. But Vishwas wants to become an actor. Dressed as a police inspector for a photo shoot, he meets social worker Kajal during a car chase. Kajal mistakes him for an inspector and thanks him for helping her catch the goons, while Vishwas plays along. He is mistakenly published in the newspaper as an inspector, which Savitri sees. She arrives in Mumbai to see her dream come true, and circumstances lead Vishwas to carry on his lie not only to Kajal but also to his mother.

While shooting for a film, Vishwas's mother discovers that he is not an inspector. She faints and is admitted to the hospital, where the doctor tells him that she needs to be operated on and the amount required is ₹ 1 million. He agrees to work for Gundappa (the boss of the goons Vishwas and Kajal caught) for money where he needs to bring a CD for them. While escaping after getting the CD, he is caught by police and accidentally shoots two police officers. Since he is now a murderer, he is left with no choice but to join Gundappa's gang. Meanwhile, Kajal, who is under the impression that Vishwas has gone bad, along with some men, plans to save him from doing any crime. So they go to the gangs den and tell the foolish Gundappa that she came to marry Vishwas. Hence, creating confusion so that Gundappa leaves Vishwas. On the other hand, Joint Commissioner (who was also kidnapped) tells Savitri that Vishwas is actually not doing any crime but is working for the police. Kajal learns this from Savitri later and goes to apologise to Vishwas for misunderstanding him. Not knowing that they are being watched on CCTV, she apologises to Vishwas and leaks details of his plans. Somehow, Vishwas and his mates are able to flee. But his mother and Kajal are held by Napoleon (the ultimate Don, boss of Gundappa). After fighting the goons, Vishwas hands over Napoleon (who is revealed to be his own father) to the police and tells everyone that he will become a police officer as they are real-life heroes. He did all the filmy actions as a fake police officer and now wants to be a real policeman. His mother's dream is finally fulfilled.",2213,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt2615584.srt","Please.

Constable.
Here's Rs. 100. - What for?
I ran a red light yesterday.
A woman was pregnant. I had to rush her to the hospital.
This is the fine for breaking the signal.
Wow, Savitribai.
If everyone can be as honest as you..
..there will be no need for us.
Okay, Jai Hind.
Hey. Where's the receipt?
Oh! I completely forgot.
Here's your receipt.
How's your son? Where is he?

When he grows up I'll make him a police officer.
I see, you mean like us.
I'll make him an honest police officer.

No, sir. Why would I be successful like them?
I am Rao. Vishwas Rao.
Hero Vishwas Rao.
What did you study in school today?
Don't ask about the study. I'm tired of studying all day.
I see. Here. I've brought dry-fruits for you.
Mom. Let me drive for a while.

Only after you turn 18 and get a license..

Come on, mom. Let me drive for a while.
No one's watching anyway.
Get down!
Don't ever say that again.
I'm watching, God's watching.
So never do anything wrong.
Do you get that? - Yes.
No, you didn't.
I'll explain to you.
Stand in front of all the trees here and say..

And..
You're going to become a police officer? - Yes, Gopi. I am.
I will be a police officer.
I'll be a Don.

Through the poster, emerges the hero.
Fantastic dialogues.
Terrific fighting.
Just like a hero. - That's what I want to be, Gopi.
Just wait and watch. Soon you'll see huge posters of me.
Did you hear, aunt? - No, mom.
Hero?
Go on. Your mother will definitely make you a police officer.
Tomorrow is your entrance exam.
Go and prepare.
Vishwas Rao!
May I come in, sir? - Come in.
Thank you, sir.
Sir!
Are you unwell? - No, sir.

But nothing to worry about, sir.
It's been like this since childhood.
Sir!
Did you hurt your leg? - No, sir.
You see...I've one short leg.
But nothing to worry about, sir.
It's been like this since childhood.
And yet you want to join the police force? - Yes, sir.
I want to join the police force and serve the country.
That's been my childhood dream.
Sir! - Fine.
Let's check your eyes. - Yes, sir.

Sir!
Take down my telephone number. Please.
If my country ever needs me..

You get exhausted even while talking.
You can't walk few steps properly.
You can't see or hear properly.
What good are you to the country?
I think you're angry right now?
I'll come later and explain to you.
What time do I come, sir?
Why you..
Get lost!
Get lost!
Get lost!
I still don't understand..
..why you always fail the police entrance test.
Forget it, mom. These policemen are not too smart.
What?
See what's written here? - What?
It says here ""Terrorists attack a group of policemen"".
""12 policemen dead.""
""Three of them were new recruits.""
They were just my age. Did you hear?
What if I had died like this?
Then, what about you?
No, mom. I don't want to make you upset..
..by joining the police.
I would've felt proud, instead of being upset. - I see.
You didn't read this other news.
It's written here..
""Dacoits shot a police officer's mother dead.""
Did you hear?
They shot the mother.
No, mom. I can't put your life in danger.
I will never join the police force, that's it.
What did you say?
How dare you? - Mom.
Listen to me, mom. - Stop. Stop I say.
Mom.. - Stop.
I'm going. - I'll teach you a lesson..
I'll show you when you come back in the evening.
""All I want is you, forever, mom.""
""I want you to be my earth and sky, forever, mom.""
""All I want is you, forever, mom.""
""I want you to be my earth and sky, forever, mom.""
""I know...that Lord dwells in our heart.""
""But...my sweet-innocent mom dwells in my heart.""
""But...my sweet-innocent mom dwells in my heart.""
""The world's crazy.""
""They go to temples and shrines to cajole the Lord.""
""My shrine's in my home, whenever I look at mom.""
""Whenever I look at mom.""
""You're the only one I pray for forever, mom.""
""You're the only feeling I want forever, mom.""
Stop. Stop. Stop.
Congratulation.
This is the reply to the application..
..that we sent to the police department.
Vishwas has been called to Mumbai for an interview.
Mumbai? - You just hit the jackpot, Vishu.
What jackpot, Gopi?
Mom's sending me for the police selection.
I know she is.
She always refused earlier.
Now you can go to Mumbai. Be a star.
""Yeah right. Go. Be a star.""
As if every director's waiting for my arrival.
Didn't I tell you?
The girl you saved at the cinema hall..
..has a distant uncle. Yogi.
He's a renowned writer.
He knows every producer/director in the industry.
He will get you a break in acting.
Really? - Yes.
Traitor, why did you go meet our enemy..
..Jt. Commissioner Khare?
And what did you tell him? Speak up.
He was saying, something despicable..
..is about to happen in the city..
..by the name of 'Mission White Elephant'.
While Elephant.
What is that?
And.. - And?
He wanted to know when Napoleon sir is arriving.
RDX. - Yes, sir.
Take him along, and practice target on him.
Jt. Commissioner Khare..
..has got a whiff of our mission.
And about Napoleon, sir.
Now there will be war.
What do I do, Lord?
What do I do?
After making me blind, You've turned deaf.

Sorry. - That's okay.
I'm an actor. And this is my first earning.
I am Istiyaq. And you? - Vishwas.
I'm here to see Yogi bhai.
How did you know I'm here to become an actor?
People come with the same dreams to Sapna Guest House.
But do their dreams get fulfilled?
Will I get a role?
All one gets are dates, dates, dates and more dates.
But no roles.
That's Vishwanath.
He's rehearsing.
Tomorrow's his date.
I mean audition.
Who is he, Istiyaq? - He's one of us.
I see. Another aspiring actor.

Who is it?
Some Vishwas is here to see you.
Hello, sir.
Vishwas. Come.
Gopi informed me that you're coming.
Now that you've come to me..
..you'll definitely be successful. - Thank you.

'Wanted?' - I saw it thrice, sir.
'Dabbang?' - Of course I watched 'Dabbang'.
I watched it umpteen times.
Did you write all these films?
I almost did.
I had all these ideas.
But...someone else made the films.
I didn't even write it on paper.
I had cooked it up fresh in my mind.
Yet they stole it.
That means you never wrote anything.
I will...for you.
I can see an actor in your eyes.
I can see your future. You're going to be a superstar.
Have you brought a photo? - Yes, sir. I did.
Just a minute.
Here.
That's a stamp. - It's a photo.
So small?
It will make your future small. - I see.
Big. Bring a bigger photo.
And listen.
Get me a whiskey...
..while coming back.
Okay?
Listen.
Buy a big bottle.
Think big, only then can you make it big.

And Gudappa Das' brother-in-law.
Dharam Prakash. DP.

First we need to save Borekar's father.
Boys. - Yes, sir.
Follow me.
Let's go, sir.
I get it, Inspector.
You're evading your duty.
But there must be one brave inspector in the city.
I am there.
I'm shooting.
The law has long arms.
That wasn't a pose.
Yes, mom. - Son. How are you?
Absolutely fine, mom.
What's the progress on your admission in the police
Yes....yes, mom. I'm preparing for that.
Good. Good. Give me the good news, soon.
Of course I will, mom. - And look after yourself.
And keep calling... whenever you get the time.
Good thing we got pictures of you in two getups.
Yes, that's great.
Hey!
Where are my clothes?
Where could they go?
Were you wearing clothes when you came in?
You think I came in nude?
Don't get angry, you will get your clothes back.
Wear this. This is the new 'Kathiawadi' dress.
It'll look nice on you.
If I wear this outside, people will think I'm crazy.
Then wear what you're wearing now.
People will salute you.
You want my scooter for few days, right?
Take it.
Let's go, quickly. - Who are you?
Follow that black car. - But I..
Stop talking, let's go.
A girl's being abducted in that black car.
You don't understand.
This is no time to talk, Inspector.
It's time for action. Let's go, quickly.
Help!
That car's speeding away, hurry up.
Look, you're mistaken.. - No, I'm not.
I heard it myself. The girl was yelling, ""Help! Help!""
It means the girl's in danger.
Drive faster.
There is the car.
Help! - Keep quite.
Somebody help me.
There's a police inspector following us, sir.
What nonsense!
Inspector Ghorpade said..
..there won't be any policeman there.
Okay. Calm down. Calm down.
I know, show my photo to the inspector.
How dare he?
He's showing you his boss' photo.
He's mocking you.
We will catch them now. We won't spare them. Driver faster. Faster.
Why are you taking wrong way, Inspector?
He changed route seeing your photo.
Very good. Very good.
Sir, the girl's going that way and you're going this..
What kind of an inspector are you? - I'm no inspector.
There goes the real inspector.
Lion-heart inspector.
Who? - Inspector Chulbul Pandey!
Robinhood Salman Khan!
Sir, there's a policeman following us.
Police? What now?
Did you jump a signal? - No, sir.
PUC? - It's there. Insurance? - It's there.
License? - It's there. Do you want me to speed up?
Do you wish to take me to the moon?
'Wanted', 'Dabbang', 'Ready', 'Ek Tha Tiger'.
What a body. Fantastic fighter.
Bhai!
Bhai! - Sir..
What happened, sir?
I'm a big fan. - I see. Thank you.
Can I get an autograph? - Of course.
Hey, hold on to this.
Sir.
Careful.
Your name? - Vishwas.
Vishwas.
Her name?
Her name? - Don't know.
Kajal. - Kajal.
Very nice. To Vishwas and Kajal.
Here. - Thank you, bhai.
Thank you. - Welcome.
Someday I will be like you. - Of course.
Of course, you sure can. - Bye.
Side. Side.
Why would he become like me?
I pose as inspector in films.
And this inspector wants to be a movie star.
Anyone can be a hero these days.
He can too.
Listen, take me to Rajkumar Santoshi's office.
The narration of 'Andaz Apna Apna-2' is in progress.
Oh no!
Aamir again.
He looks more handsome in real life.
The black car's heading this way.
That inspector turned out to be really smart, sir.
He took a short-cut and cut us off.
What? What are you still thinking about?
Get out of there.
Forget the girl. Take the photo and make a run for it.
You goons. Where are you going? - Run. Run. Run.
Sir, we scared them off.
Thank you, sister. You saved me.
Not me, he did.
Thank him. He saved you.
Thank you officer, for saving me.
I am Suman Thappa.
Chief Security Officer Bhimsingh Thappa's daughter.
Sister, please give me your phone.
Thank you.
Sir, forgive me.
I misunderstood you. - You still misunderstand me..
No, no, now I know you very well.
Salman Khan was just an excuse.
Actually, you wanted to take a short-cut and cut them off. Right?
You're the first brave ..
.. and honest officer I've come across in the city.
I'm really impressed.
Sir!
Speak up.
How much more money do you want?
Like I said I don't know that inspector.. - Don't lie to me.
There was a time, when police officers were honest.
They had character.
We would grease their palms..
..and they would give us protection.
And today...even after paying money..
..we can't commit a small abduction in the city?
I'll talk to the department, Sir.
No need to talk.
Just give me the name of that inspector.
I really don't know who he is, sir.
Lying again.
Biscuit.
You won't make this mistake again.
Yes, sir,
Sir...
...maybe that inspector's one of Jt. Commissioner Khare' man.
Right.
You're right, Ghorpade.
Thank you, sir. - Biscuit.
So you are wearing Vishwas' clothes.
If you keep this up, someday you'll be defamed.
""I will be defamed.""
I'm from the DNA paper.
Mr. Lalwani was supposed to give me a photograph.
Daddy, someone's here from the DNA paper.
Yes. Give him the inspector's photo.
It's kept ready on the table. - Ready?
Stop, sister. Stop.
Good news.
Vishwas has become a police inspector. - What?
Look, his photo's been published in the papers.
Oh!
What's written in it? - I don't know.
The paper's torn.
I got my hands on it in the temple.
Hail Goddess Durga! - Yes, Lord.
My son's become a police inspector.
Take this. You take too.
My son's become a police inspector.
My son's become a police inspector.
Thief!

All you need is one break..
..and you will be a movie star.
Like this.
Movie star?
Like this? - Police!
You're fantastic, sir.
No, no, it was a mistake.. - No, mistake.
Throwing that peel was just an excuse.
You wanted to catch the thief without laying a finger.
He's a police officer.
Honest. Brave. - Thank you, Officer.
This Gundappa Das' thug was fleeing with my diamonds.
Which station should I take him to? - Take him to any one.

This role won't suit him.
Okay?
Shabbo.
As soon as you step out of the swimming pool.. - Sir, please!
Oh gosh!
I will act well.
Look, this role is of a bad character.
You look more like a good character.
You can't do it. Okay.
Goodbye.
Shabbo.
As soon as you step out of the swimming pool..
Sir, please.
At least see my acting first.
Sir, when am I coming out of the pool?
You will. You will.
What are these?
What are these?
Eyes, sir.
They are cameras.
I can tell what one can, or cannot do.
You cannot do it.
Go. Get out! - No, sir.. Come.
Illiterate children of.. - Hey!
Don't utter a word against my mother!
I'll yank your tongue out!
He's.. - What director? To heck with such a director.
He only copies Madrasi and Hollywood films..
..to earn this fame. - Hey, you..
Hey!
Make a sound and I'll kill you right now.
Hey, mister.. - Move back! Back!
Move back! Back!
You were wrong.
You shouldn't have insulted my mother.
She's a mother after all.. - Stop this..
Quiet!
I came here for job.
I didn't come here to beg you.
I wanted to become an actor.
It was my childhood dream.
I thought I would come to Mumbai, work hard..
Carve a niche for myself.
But this stupid..
..is in a hurry to get her out of the pool.
That's why he's throwing us out!
Let's go, Vishwas, he.. - What did I say to him?
I said ""Give me a chance. Give me a chance to act"".
He says, ""These are..""
Vishwa.. - What did you say?
No..
What are these?
What are these? What are these?
Eyes. - No. Camera.
Yes. Camera. - Yes.
You can see everything.
So...what am I going to do? - What?
Say it, otherwise your camera..
Sir, is this bad enough?
What? - You said it's a bad character.
Yes.
Acting? - Yes, sir.
Good.
I can be worse, sir. - No, no. Good.
Bad. Good. Bad.
Good..
Very good. Very good.
Selected.
Great, sir.
What happened? - He got the role.
What are you saying?
He's a star now. Star.
The phone's ringing.
It's ringing. Answer it. Mother.
Yes, mom. How are you?
I never thought you'll do this to me.
I know everything.
Sorry, mom, I.. - Be quiet.
You got selected as a police officer and didn't tell me.
Police officer? - Enough.
Stop with your charades.
I saw your photo in the paper.
In the police uniform. - Photo?
Police? - I am coming to Mumbai day-after-tomorrow.
For three days. - What?
I've a desire to see you in the police uniform.
To see you doing your duty.
My train will arrive at 3 o'clock. Pick me up from the station.
No, Guru. I can't do it.
I've already lied to mother before.
I've hurt her once.
I can't hurt her anymore.
You've great sentiments.
Tomorrow when she finds out that..
..you're preparing to be an actor, not a police officer..
..do you think it'll make her happy?
What do I do, Guru?
What do I do? - Just do as I said.
Just pose as a police inspector..
..in front of your mother, that's it.
Just like Sanjay Dutt posed as a doctor in 'Munnabhai'?
Exactly, son. Same to same.
Mom's coming home for three days.
We'll borrow a house, jeep and a police uniform for few days.
You just have to pretend that you're a police inspector.
Guru, this will give us a chance to act as well. - Right.
We'll act really well, Guru. - Right.
And I'll do the best acting of my life.
See. Everything's very good.
Mother. - No. Don't touch my feet while you're still in uniform.
Respect it.
Give it to me.
What happened, mom? - Nothing.
Nothing.
How are you? - I'm fine.
How are you? - Me?
Inspector Vishwas Rao. - Hello, Father Anthony Gonzalez.
God bless you, my child. God bless you.
You did a splendid job by closing down..
..the bars and gambling dens in our area.
That's my duty, Father.
I'm so proud of you, my child!
A honest, loyal, capable, talented police officer like you..
..can't be in our area.
Inspector Vishwas. I would like to... meet your mom, just once.
She's my mom, Father.
Oh!
I am so lucky to be meeting you.
How many sons do you have?
I have just one son.
How sad. How very sad.
Why didn't you have some more children? - What?
It would've been in the interest of the country.
You're just great to give birth to an officer like him.
Bless me, O mother!
He's taking her blessings.
Bless me so that next time I can be your son..
..and a brave officer like him. Make my country proud.
Excuse me, lady Is that your bag? The red and yellow. - No, no.
Okay, thank you.
Son, where's the priest? - Mom. It was time for his prayers.
Go on, son.
Don't disgrace your Guru.
I am very happy. - Hello, sir. - Hello.
Sir. Is she your mother? - Yes. She is.
Hello, madam. - Hello.
I want to be honest with you.
Your son.. - Yes.
Your son...isn't a police officer. - What?
He's not a police officer. - What are you saying?
He's God.
God, dressed in a uniform.
You risked your life alone, to protect us helpless..
..and drove out 50 goons.
And you thrashed them so hard that. - How?
He thrashes them so hard..
..the other goons fled for their lives hearing them scream.
You are...the protector of the poor.
You...are just!
You are...the pride of our country.
""May our flag always soar high.""
""The pride and glory of our country.""
""May our flag always soar high.""
Before he goes up the Red Fort with the flag..
Bring him down? - Hmmm.
Coolie. - Yes.
O Inspector. I'll build a shrine for you.
Aunt. I'll keep you there too. - What?
And...worship you both..
Aunt, are those black and yellow bags yours? - No. - Sorry.
Where is he?
Mom, it was time for him to pray.
Come, mom.
One minute. I will just move it.
Do fast.
Anyone there?
Some one help.
Vishwas, what's going on?
Where, mom?
Look. Some goons are beating them up. - Help!
Where, mom?
Not there, here.
Save me, Inspector.
They are calling you. - No, no.
Mom...they aren't calling me, but their area's inspector.
Mister, hurry up. - Done, sir.
Go take a look. - I can't go, mom.
This isn't my area.
Hurry up. - You mind your area, and I'll deal with them.
Mom. Mom.
Mom.
Move back.
Stop. - Who are you, woman?
I'm the inspector's mother.
Mom, what are you doing? Let's go.
Inspector. Are you new in the area?
What would you do if he was old? - Mom, wait.
Inspector, we've been running this school for 60 years.
And now Gudappa Das' henchmen want to force us out.
They want to build a dance bar here.
Are you done? You heard enough?
Once the bar opens you can come have free food.
Get going.
Vishwas. What's he saying? - Yes..
How dare you scold me in front of my mother?
Not just that, he's scolding you, a police officer.
Yes, mom. I'm a police inspector.
What's your name? - Stupid. Insects like you..
..know me for my fist, not my name.
Good one, mom? - First class.
Stop that and thrash him. - I will.
What did you say? - Get lost!
Get lost!
This is our house, mom.
Isn't it first class?
Wow! You've such a big house.
No, mom. Not the one downstairs. That's closed.
We've just rented the top floor.
Rented? - No, aunt. Let me tell you.
Sir means the government has rented out the room to him.
Do you get it? Because they're happy with his work.
Of course. My son's done such a good job.
The government's got to be pleased.
Very good. Very, very, good.
Ghorpade. - Yes, sir.
Which new officer did you train in your police station..
..that's doing such a great job in your area?
The other day he saved a girl from abduction.
Then he apprehended the thief.
And today he thrashed Gundappa's goons.
Single-handedly.
I am impressed.
Sir, I.. - Of course.
I will put in a recommendation for your promotion.
I am very happy. - Sir, he really..
You really have done a good job.
I will put in a recommendation for your..
Borekar. What's this?
You had moustaches, didn't you?
I still do, sir.
Well. Gentlemen.
There's bad news.
Napoleon's coming to Mumbai.
Interpol's sent us some photographs of Napoleon.
Take a close look at these photos..
..and recognise him well.
Did you get a good look?
Good! Smuggling. Drugs. Terrorism.
Napoleon takes contracts for all these.
According to the information received from RAW..
..he's coming to Mumbai soon.
To execute a dangerous mission.
And his mission's called 'Mission White Elephant'.
We've to thwart 'Mission White Elephant' at any cost.
And we've to catch Napoleon alive..
..and make Mumbai police proud.
And..
Let's catch him first.
Guru. How did you like mom's cooking? - Fantastic.
I say let's get some for dinner as well.
Hot vegetables.
I'm eating your cooked food after so long.
Feels so nice.
But, mom. It would've been so much better..
..if you could stay for few more days.
Why did you come for just three days?
Yes, son. I was thinking the same thing.
Water.
But, mom. How can you stay back here?
You've things to do back in the village. - Yes.
No, son.
When you're insisting..
..then I'll stay a few months with you.
Yes, yes. Of course.
But.. - Mind your duty, sir.
How can you stay back?
Three days later you've to leave with the CM for three months.
For security reasons. - Yes.
No. I'll refuse the CM.
I'll tell him, ""My mom's arrived from the village,
.. so I'm staying with her"".
Right, mom. - Duty comes first, mother later.
Don't worry about me. I'll come visit you again.
What?
She's saying she'll come visit you again. - Yes.
Good morning, sir.. Evening?
Afternoon, sir. - You called?
You sent that inspector again, Ghorpade..
..to beat-up my men.
Sir, I've told you before.
He's not one of us.. - Lying again.
Why don't you just say how much money do you want?
I don't want money, sir? - So?
Do you want property this time?
No, sir. I mean...I don't know who the inspector is.
Sir, that inspector thrashed us really bad.
He jumped kicked us.
He made us run for our lives, sir.
Look. He thrashed them so badly.
He beat Madan black and blue. - Sir, I'm Mohan.
He's beat them up so badly.
You can't make out who's Madan, who's Mohan.
We're going back to our village, sir.
See, Ghorpade.
Half of them are heading back to their village..
..and the other half are in the hospital.
Mission White Elephant is in its final stages.
Sir.. - Either you drag him here by his foot or his hair..
..but bring him to me, or else I'll skin you alive.
What?
Director Anees Bazmi's given an appointment?
Yes, Anees Bazmi. - Great, Guru.
I'll be right there.
Just don't let Anees leave. - Who is Anees?
Anees is a very big movie.. - Movie?
Don.
He's a don.
Just like there are dangerous villains in films..
..similarly, they are real life dons.
We finally managed to get a grip on them. I mean, find them.
So...I'll go make a plan to catch him. Give me your blessings.
No need to worry. I've found out everything.
Joint commissioner Khare's home is undergoing repairs.
So he's rented the ground floor of your home for a month. That's it.
Guru. If that joint commissioner sees me in uniform..
..he'll throw me in jail.
That won't happen.
Just do as you were doing until now. Acting..
Silence.
Hello, sir. - Hello.
My son's a police inspector too.
We live on the upper floor. - I see.
Yes. He just joined the police force.
He's closed down many bars and gambling dens. - I see.
And he beat up some criminals so badly..
..that the other goons fled the city hearing their screams.
What's his name?
Vishwas Rao.
Vishwas? - He's after some Don.. Yes.
He's planning to apprehend some don called Anees.
Anees? Anees Ismail? That dangerous don.
He's planning to catch him.
Then I would like to meet him right now.
What? - Yes.
You're laughing.
The commissioner's waiting for you downstairs..
Mom, you got fooled too.
You're so innocent.
He's no police commissioner.
He's not the commissioner. Then?
He's an actor. - Actor?
He used to work as a commissioner in TV serials.
One day he suddenly stopped getting work..
..and lost his mind.
Then? - He went mad.
He dons the police uniform and sets out on the road.
He goes and sits in any police station that he sees.
Oh Lord! - Lord, have mercy on him.
And he's been kept here for treatment. - I see.
And those people around him, in uniform, are crazy. - What?
I mean they're actors.
They're acting so that he feels he's the commissioner.
But why? - Because the doctor's said..
..this is the only way to treat him.
And the doctor's also said keep his illusion intact. - Why?
Because if his illusion shatters, then he can lose his life.
Heart-fail.
Son..
Son, we won't shatter his illusion either.
You've got to act in front of him as well. - Mom. You know I can't act
Try. - Okay, mom. I will.
Only for you.
My mom's..
What?
That's why I..
Look, first speak then cry.
Or first cry then speak.
Don't speak and cry together, Inspector.
I am not an inspector. - What?
Yes. - And this uniform? - It's rented.
I've worn it to keep my mother alive.
What's this story? - It's a sad story.
My mother loved watching films.
One day she went to watch a film.
The story of an honest officer and his mother.
Suddenly, the fan above fell on my mother's head.
Oh, my God! Then what?
The fan stopped, but my mother lost her mind.
Oh no. - Oh yes.
Since then she thinks I'm a police officer.
And I wear this uniform in front of her.
But what do the doctors say?
They say this is the only way to treat her.
Keep her illusion intact. - Why?
Because if I take off my uniform..
..then my mother will lose her life.
Keep this uniform on. - Yes.
We'll keep your mother's illusion intact, Vishwas.
Inspector Vishwas. - Yes.
Mr. Commissioner, she's my mother. - Yes, we've met before.
Mom, he's the Commissioner.
My son really praises you.
He says you're a big television.. - Mom..
Television?
I mean, there's no other police officer like you in this city.
Yes. - I am saying the right thing, isn't it?
And I say, your son acts so well..
Sir.. - Act? - I meant active.
He's the most active inspector in our entire department.
Right, Vishwas?
Inspector Vishwas.
Mr. Commissioner, do look after yourself. - Yes.
You shouldn't go out on the streets wearing this uniform.. - Mom.
Alone on the streets?
I mean, you should keep your constables with you. - Yes.
And you should watch fewer films. - Sir.
I don't watch films.
I do. I watch lots of films.
Just a minute, madam. Just come with me. - Yes.
Vishwas, what is she saying?
Television serial? Don't roam the streets? I'm confused.
There's no confusion. It's simple.
Really? - You're not the joint commissioner.
What? - For my mother.
Yes. - But you are, for me. - Thank God.
I'm a police inspector. - But you said you're not.
For my mom, sir.
But I'm not, for you.
And.. - I get it. I understand.
I'm the joint commissioner, but I am not.
In your mom's view.
And you're not a police inspector, but you are one.
In your mom's view.
And mother's a mother after all.
But she isn't, in whose view?
A mother's always a mother, in everyone's view.
Sir, you're so.. - Yes.
A mother's always a mother.
There are bigger malls here in Mumbai.
Hello, sir. I was looking for you.
Sir.
Hello.
Who is she? - She's my mother. - What?
Sorry. Are you my mother?
Vishwas.
She's my mother. - Aunt.
Bless you, dear.
Who is she? - She's a girl.
I know that, but who is she?
She's a girl, and.. - Kajal.
She's Kajal, mom.
Whenever anything bad occurs in the city..
..you will find her there.
What? - Aunt, let me tell you.
I'm a social worker. - Yes.
Whenever I see anything wrong happening in the city..
..I inform the police. - Great. You do the right thing.
And I'm here with a complaint right now, aunt. For him.
Sir, Paradise club at Gol Chowki..
..deal in every kind of illegal drugs and business.
I just found out that..
..some juvenile girls are being held captive there.
Oh God! - Yes. Let's go.
Let's go lodge a complaint with the police. - What?
I'm the police.
I'm the police.
But that isn't my area, Kajal.
So, go lodge a complaint with the area's inspector.
Go fast. I did go there. - You did.
But inspector Ghorpade isn't ready to listen.
He isn't? - No. - Forget the area.
Go, go with her. And free those girls. Go.
I can't go, mom.
I..
Dear, which way? - Aunt.
At Gol Chowki, there's a.. - Quiet.
Hold this, mom.
Let's go, mom. Come, Kajal. - Come.
100 million in cash.
Anything special? - It's very special.
All this money is for 'Mission White Elephant'. - Oh!
Remember. Gundappa sir has said, ""Be careful"".
Don't worry.
This is one of Gundappa sir's safest places.
No one can come here. - Good.
Let us go!
What a club!
Till now I only saw them in films.
It's the Abode of Gods!
Rambha. Menka. Urvashi. They're all here.
They are not girls, they're vanilla ice-cream.
Sir. What are you staring at?
I wasn't staring. I was thinking,
.. girls like you shouldn't go to a club..
..like this to see such cheap dance.
We should leave right now. Come on.
Sir, we're not here to see the dance.
We're here to free the girls.
Inspector! - Don't you know that..
..the police are not allowed in this club?
So what are you doing here?
Just taking a stroll around. Just like that.
It's nice. - No, it's not.
We're here to conduct a raid.
I'm a reporter. And I've information that..
..you've held some girls captive here.
Bring them out. - Hey, girl. What nonsense.
Calm down, Kajal. Calm down.
Sir. Are you scared of fighting?
No, I'm not scared. I enjoy fighting.
You see, Kajal.
If they injure my face my career will be over forever. - What?
Let me talk to them. - You will talk to us?
You will talk to us?
Bachchan Singh!
Muktar. Balbeer.
Baktawar. Kallan.
Why call so many people to talk?
This is how we talk here. - Oh!
Just mind your own business..
..get something to eat and get lost. - Okay.
We're here to teach you a lesson.
This inspector is a bulldozer without brakes.
Once he starts he doesn't stop.
I see. - Move aside.
Shoot him!
""You don't know.'
""You don't know who I am.""
""You don't know.'
""You don't know who I am.""
""Naughty eyes.""
""Silky arms.""
""Sexy body.""
""I've a crazy gait.""
""You...you...you...you...""
""You don't know.'
""You don't know who I am.""
Kajal! - Sir. - Girls.
Come on, get out quickly. Run away!
Money.
What's going on here?
Let's go.
Attention!
Officer, attention..
Ghorpade, we called you long ago. Ghorpade sir, this isn't right.
Why did you take so long to come here?
You have again sent the same inspector.
No, I mean.. Move on.
Breaking news.
Police conduct a raid at Gundappa Das' Paradise club.
On the orders of Gol Chowki police station's..
..senior inspector Ghorpade..
..one of his young officers, didn't just thrash the goons..
..but also rescued some juvenile girls.
And confiscated millions of rupees.
Ghorpade sir, what would you like to say?
Me?
I am sorry, sir.
What do I say?
I don't know who did it.
I just arrived recently.
How much is this?
Who told you?
Kajal, what are you doing?
What if it starts raining?
The doctor's asked you to keep the wound dry.
It feels nice.
Of course, all the girls were rescued.
Except for one. - What?
No, they all ran away.
I saw it myself.
Why are you laughing? - Just like that.
Only crazy people laugh without a reason.
I can't see a rickshaw around either.
If it starts raining, we'll be in trouble.
That'll be even better.
I don't know, but everything seems nice.
I'm injured, but even that feels nice.
Madam. Did you hit your head?
Have you lost your mind?
I grew up alone.
I was very young,
when my parents..
And,
I never..
..had a kin.
Today,
for the first time..
.. It felt like..
..I've a kin.
""You're the dream.""
""I'm the slumber.""
""Together we make up the night."" - I am always with you.
""Every day I pray... that our wishes are fulfilled.""
""Our wishes are fulfilled.""

The cash that I sent for 'Mission White Elephant'..
..was confiscated.
Why? - Yes, sir.
There's a police inspector..
..who, for no reason...always..
Sir, I've seen that inspector.
And...soon I'll find him.
Finish him.
And be careful.
RAW and Interpol are keeping an eye on our movements.
Look.
We won't discuss this any further.
I'm sending you the entire information of this mission..
..through an agent, on a CD.
And make no mistakes.
I'm arriving next week.
Okay?
Brother Madhav, I have left for the station.
What's this crowd for? - Don't know, madam.
I will miss my train.
Hire another rickshaw. - How much?
What is my mistake... let me go.
Let me go.
Don't beat me. Someone help me. - You lodge complaint.
Come with me. - Leave me. Let me go.
What is my mistake... don't beat me.
Leave me.
Someone help me.
You lodge complaints. Come to the police station.
Someone help me. - Leave her.
Mom.. - Don't call me mom. Don't call me mom.
You've humiliated your mother, not just this uniform.
Why didn't you just die? Why didn't you die?
What's going on? Get her out! Get her out!
She's my mom.
There is shooting going on here.
There is shooting going on here.
Listen to me, mom.
Drive away this mad woman from here.
Listen to me.
Move from here.
Don't touch my mother. Don't touch my mother.
Listen to me, mom. Mom..
Mom..
Mom!
Someone get me a rickshaw.
Someone get me a taxi.
Someone get me a rickshaw.
How's mom?
Don't know.
I'm not a police inspector, Kajal.
I was only lying.
I lied to mom as well.
That's why she..
Mom will be fine, Vishwas..
""Mother..""
""I know...I'm lonely.""
""How can I live...if you leave me?""
""Don't stay silent, say something.""
""You can scold me if you like.""
""You can scold me if you like.""
""Mother..""
""Mother..""
Will you do as I say, son?
Of course, mom. I will. Tell me.
Will you deceive me again?
No, mom.
Never again.
Forgive me.
What do you want?
Get me...some poison.
I don't want to live.
Don't say that, mom.
Don't say that.
I'll never do anything wrong again.
Never again.
You acted so well.
Even...your mother couldn't recognise you.
You'll be a good actor.
No, mom.
I don't want to be an actor.
I want to be a police officer.
An honest police officer. I don't want to be an actor.
Please go out, you are not allowed.
Look, her condition's critical.
She needs complete rest.
Doctor, will my mother be okay? - We can't say right now.
Please leave.
Your mother will be fine, Vishwas.
She's just shocked.
Because her dreams were shattered.
When you were one year old..
Your father was a cruel officer.
He would take money from the rich..
..and do their dirty jobs for them.
'Savitri. Don't interfere.'
'She's a decent girl, let her..'
'I want to teach a lesson to this decent girl's father.'
'That girl's father, Shashtri owned a factory..'
'..which was the only means of earning for the villagers.'
'The rich men wanted that land.'
No, inspector. Don't do that. I will sign.
'Helpless Shashtri signed on the papers.'
'The same night both father and daughter committed suicide.'
'People were furious, they set out to kill your father.'
'I've told you before, stop these illegal deeds.'
'The curse of these poor people..'
''..will never let us live happily.'
'If anything happens to you..'
'The same old thing. The same old lecture.'
'I made a big mistake marrying you.'
'I admit your father was an honest policeman.'
'But how did he die? A pauper.'
'I don't want to die like that, Savitri.'
'Everyone has to die one day.'
'Everyone does.'
'But the question is how does one live.'
'If you want to live then come with me.'
'They can come..'
'Savitri..'
'Listen.'
'No..'
'There are his wife and kid. Finish them!'
'Stop!'
'No one will lay a finger on them.'
'I will break your heads.'
'You will save them!'
Our curse will finish Yashwant Rao's family.'
'We won't spare them either.'
'We left the village. - Both mother and son will suffer.'
'And your mother swore..'
'..that she will repent for your father's crimes.'
'By making you an honest police officer.'
'And people will sing praises of your honesty.'
'It will restore people's trust on policemen.'
That's why she named you Vishwas (Trust).
Mr. Vishwas.
Dr. Vinod Khanna's calling you.
Vinod Khanna's turned a doctor?
What? But he's always been a doctor.
Come. - I see.
So, he was acting in films just like that.
Stop thinking about films, Vishwas.
Vinod Khanna can be someone else's name too.
Come on. - Yes, come on.
Your mother's in a bad condition.
We'll have to perform surgery.
It'll cost around one million.
One million?
Deposit the money soon.
We don't have much time.
Start preparing for the surgery, Doctor.
I'll get the money.
Somehow.
You are under arrest.
For posing as a cop.
My mother's very ill.
I've to arrange for one million for her surgery.
I am sorry!
Come with us.
Come.
Tell me, sir. Where are you taking me to?
To us.
Who said that?
I...am Gundappa Das.
But why bring me here?
You need rupees one million.
We'll help you.
Why?
Why will you give me the money?
Because you will do a job for us.
Look. I won't do anything wrong.
No one pays one million for doing anything good, son.
Hello. - Dr. Khanna, here.
Your mother's condition is getting critical.
And you haven't paid the money yet.
No, sir. I'm trying, sir.
Please understand and do something fast.
I'm trying.
I want rupees one million.
Tell me the job.
A cultural dance troupe..
..has arrived in Mumbai from Hong Kong.
Our agent has sent a CD through them.
They're performing a show today.
You'll go up on the stage during the show..
..collect the CD and bring it here.
But any of your henchmen can do this job.
The security there is tight.
And it's impossible for any stranger to get in.
Then how will I get in?
The chief security officer for the show is Bhimsingh Thappa.
And we had kidnapped his girl..
..and you rescued her on Link Road.
'I am Suman Thappa chief security officer..
..Bhimsingh Thappa's daughter.'
Both, father and daughter think..
..you're an honest police officer.
So with their help, you can easily get on stage.

Catch him, Ghorpade.
Run! Run!
Vishwas! Vishwas! What have you done?
You killed two policemen.
Give me the gun.
You were supposed to keep the police engrossed.
How did they come here?
I don't know.
Come to your senses, Vishwas.
The car's here. Run.
Run!
Go! Go!
Vishwas killed two policemen, sir. - What?
That's good, Ghorpade.
Now Vishwas has no other option..
..and we've a new lifetime gang-member.
Good..
Kajal. Yes, Kajal. How's mom?
Mom's not in the hospital, Vishwas.
She's not in the hospital?
We looked everywhere, but can't find her.
Very good. Very good.
Boys... - Where's my mom?
Mom!
She's right here.
And she's perfectly alright.
Don't worry. She's absolutely fine.
She didn't need any surgery.
She only had blood pressure..
..and we controlled it with medication.
So, why did you lie to me?
I told him to.
Because I wanted you to do this job.
This is our gang-doctor.
Just like a family doctor is called family doctor..
..similarly, I am his gang's doctor.
What's this nonsense?
Your lie ruined my entire life.
I killed two policemen today, and you..
Calm down, sonny. Calm down.
You asked me for a million rupees for surgery..
..which I am giving you.
To heck with your money.
Where's my mom?
She's in that room.
She's angry with you.
You killed two policemen.
I had to tell her.
You?
Get out of here. Go away.
I don't want to see your face.
Listen to me, mom.. - I don't want to hear anything.
I don't want to hear anything. Just go away. Just go away.
Mother.. - Your mother's dead. Your mother's dead.
Just go away. Go away or I'll kill myself right now. - I'm going.
No, mom. I'm going. - Just go away.
Go away. - I'm leaving. Just go away.
Your decision isn't right.
Once you join the gang, you won't have a way out.
Let's go and tell the police.. - No, Kajal.
Mom's in their captivity.
You won't tell the police anything, Kajal.
For my sake.
But, Vishwas, how is this.. - Just forget me, Kajal.
Your world's full of bright life, hopes.
My world's filled with darkness and nothing else.
We cannot be together, Kajal.
And..
And?
And what?
Say it.
We won't meet again.
I'm sorry.

1000 kilos of cocaine,
will be delivered tomorrow afternoon..
..to the special chamber of the Versova warehouse.
The computerized lock will open..
..only through the CD that I sent you.
Collect the consignment and keep it in your warehouse.
I'm arriving day-after-tomorrow.
Same place, same time,
where I always land.
Good bye.
That's Napoleon sir's mission.
White elephant!
1000 kilos of cocaine!
Hands up. No one moves.
Load it. Load it. Load the goods.
Get down. Get down. Jesse. Lock everybody up.
Lock everyone up.
Lock. Lock them.
Lock. Jesse. Call the area in-charge and call them here. Ok.
I'm taking the truck to the police warehouse. - Yes, sir.
Vishwas, you?
Stop.
Vishwas.
Sir.. - How did Khare get there?
They're policemen, they're bound to get there.
But why did Vishwas go there?
Didn't you tell him not to? - Yes.
He's a novice.
The commissioner must have arrested him..
..and he must have blurted everything.
And the police must be on their way here. - Hey..
We're dead. - Saved.
Here's your enemy, Joint Commissioner Khare.
And I've delivered your truck loaded with goods to your warehouse.
Ghorpade. - Yes, sir.
You here? - I work second shift here, sir.
Aren't you ashamed? - I am, sir.
Well done, Vishwas. Well done.
Napoleon sir will be very pleased with you.
To heck with your Napoleon.
I'm doing this for my mom.
My mom's suffering here.
I want to take her back to our village.
How can you go?
The entire Mumbai police will come here..
..looking for Khare sir.
They won't. - Why?
Because he'll inform his department..
..that he's going out of the city for a few days..
..and they shouldn't look for him. - No, I won't.
What?
You will.
You will say it and also help us.
Will you say it or not?
Speak. - Yes, I will. I will.
Good boy. Tie him up.
Take some lessons from him, Ghorpade.
Take some lessons from him.
Why are you tying up this poor man? - Tightly.
Look, he's no police officer.
He just likes to roam around in uniform. - Tie him.
He's a television actor.
I know, I know.
There's no television in your room.
That's why we brought this actor here.
Now watch him perform.
Listen..
Madam.
I am actually the joint commissioner of police.
Let it be.
Get yourself treated by a good doctor.
No, try to understand.
Madam. These gang members..
..were forcing Vishwas to do a wrong deed..
..by making the excuse of your illness.
That's when he came to me.
I won't do anything wrong again, sir.
I've a suggestion, Vishwas. - Yes, sir.
Just like Gundappa said, collect the CD..
..and deliver it to him.
Do they pay you too? - Oh shut up!
I want you to join Gundappa's gang.
That means they definitely do.
Hey, sit down!
I've a plan.
This way we can eradicate Gundappa and his gang.
And that's why..
..I want you to execute this job and enter his gang.
I want you to join their gang and extract information..
I got it, sir.
Just like Amitabh Bachchan did in 'Don'.
Right, sir?
Yes.
And if you do that, they will pay for your mother's surgery.
She will receive treatment.
And you will join their gang and work as a police informer.
I will work for the police?
My mother will be really happy.
Sister, for your happiness..
..Vishwas agreed to do policeman's job.
While doing this job, you will kill two policemen.
What are you saying, sir?
Not really. Fake bullets. Fake deaths.
This way Gundappa will start trusting you.
And he won't kill you, instead he'll let you join his gang.
What an idea, sir.
No one can imagine that you can think so well. - Thank you.
What did you say? - See you, sir.
Stop. - What now?
Vishwas, keep this watch.
Whenever you press this button..
..a light will blink on the other watch.
After that, regardless of where we are..
..we can talk to each other, through this watch-phone.
Now watch. I'll talk and you listen. - Sir.
Hello, Vishwas.
I've entrusted you with the job..
..of a secret agent for the Mumbai Police.
You'll have to do this job with great responsibility.
Are you listening?
Of course, sir. I'm with you, sir.
You had to stand there and listen over the watch-phone, idiot!
Where are you going?
To stand there and listen, sir. - Vishwas.
Sir..
Will you be able to do this job?
Of course, sir. I'll do it really well.
Okay.
Then keep this phone. - Thank you, sir.
But I have a phone.
This isn't for making calls, Vishwas.
When you press this button twice..
..it will give out a blinding flash..
..and severe everyone's vision for a while.
This will help you when you're in trouble.
Wonderful, sir.
You just turned me into James Bond, sir.
Why did you press the button now?
I was testing it, sir.
You could've told me so. I would've closed my eyes.
Now listen. - Sir, I can't see a thing.
You need ears to listen.
I do have ears, sir.
So, look.. - I can't see, sir.
Oh God! Listen and understand. - Yes, sir.
The secret, that you're working for Mumbai Police..
..you won't reveal it to anyone.
Not even your mother. - Why, sir?
If the gang-members find out, they will shoot you. - Oh gosh!
And if you have an encounter with the police..
..they will kill you too. - Oh God!
But why, sir?
I'm working for the police. - Yes.
You know it, I know it..
..but the police department doesn't.
I can see again.
Where are you?
There you are. - Sir..
Sir, I suggest that you write it down on paper..
..that I work for the police department..
..and keep it somewhere safe. - Why?
Because, if you die I'll be in trouble.
Amitabh had to face lot of problems in 'Don', sir.
Fine, fine. I will.
But now you go and execute your mission cautiously.
Good luck.
Vishwas is working for the police.
Is it true, Mr. Commissioner?
Absolutely true.
No, madam. Please don't cry.
Vishwas is always worried about you.
Please don't worry.
Everything will be alright.
Goddess.
Let my Vishwas be successful in his mission.
We've to foil Vishwas' mission at any cost.
We should stop him from committing anymore crime.
You said he's joined some gang.
What can we possibly do now?
We should do something to foil the entire gang's mission.
And Vishwas gets the credit for it.
And he becomes a hero in the view of the law.
Hero?
To be the hero one needs to kill the villain.
Tell me one thing..
In his film.. - What?
Sorry. Who's the villain in his story?
Yes!
Napoleon sir.
I've configured this just like you wanted me to.
Ready to go. - Very good.
Ready to...go.
Relax, gentlemen.
Relax.
He knew too much about our mission White Elephant.
I don't take chances.
Now I'm ready.
Ready to tighten the noose around Mumbai's neck.
As soon as I wring Mumbai's neck..
..entire India will scream.
Your organization's motive will be fulfilled soon.
And what if you fail?
Remember, you can deceive the Indian Police..
..but not us.
You know what we can..
..and are capable of doing.
Escaped convict inspector Yashwant Rao.
You shouldn't utter the name of the dead.
Napoleon always completes his mission.
Everyone knows that in our world.
Transfer the money in my account.
Goodbye.
What's wrong, sir? You called for me urgently.
You know her? - Hello.
You? Who are you?
Well done! Bravo, son!
Today you refuse to recognise my daughter.
But I hope you recognise me.
Thakur Joginder Singh.
Who are they, sir?
Let's kill him, father.. - Let's kidnap him, father.
Shut up you fool.
Do you want to make your sister a widow?
Have you thought what we'll tell Manglu?
Manglu? Who's Manglu? - I don't know, sir.
Let's kill him, father.. - Let's kidnap him, father..
Quiet. We'll kill him, we'll kidnap him.
But for now, we're here to talk marriage.
Stop that, Priest.
He's right. Don't waste it.
Now he'll convince the groom.
Uncle Gundu. - Gundu?
Yes, you. Convince him or we'll call the police.
Give me your phone. - No police. No police.
It must be telepathy, the police are already here.
Lovely India, dear. - Sir, you called me urgently.
Who are they? - Kajal? You here?
Thank God, at least you recognised me.
Do you know her? - Yes. She's complaint Kajal.
She always comes to the police station with a complaint.
I've a complaint today as well.
Who's it about? - Him.
He loved me. We sung duets.
He promised to marry me. And.. - No.
No, dear. Don't get into too much detail.
You've already lost your honour.
Now think about your father.
Sir, they're all lying.
Let's kill him, father.. - Let's kidnap him, father.
Shut up you fool.
If we kill him, what are we going to tell Manglu? - Manglu?
Who's Manglu? - I don't know, Gundappa sir.
Let's kill him, father.. - Let's kidnap him, father.
Violence again!
Small mouth, big moustache.
If we kill him, what are we going to tell Manglu?
Just a minute.
Who is Manglu?
You don't know about Manglu, sir? - No, I don't.
Manglu. Little son.
Vishwas' little son. Still to be born.
He's still in my daughter's womb.
Manglu. Hold this, son.
Vishwas. What is this?
I don't know, sir. This is not mine.
Shut up. Come here.
Come here. Come here. Look. Napoleon sir's arriving tonight.
If they mess up anything, then we'll be dead.
Just tell me clearly. If you don't know them..
..I'll kill them right now and bury them here.
Now tell me clearly.
Did you have any relation with this girl?
A little.
Just a little?
A little more.
Oh God..
Look. I've convinced Vishwas for the marriage. - Thank God.
Stop that, Priest. Or I will shoot you.
I just convinced him for now.
Look. We've an important job to do.
We'll first finish that job and then the wedding.
That's called justice.
His Majesty's justice.
I won't say it! I won't say it! I won't say it!
You'll have to say it, sir! Right, sir?
What, sir? Tell him what he has to say.
He'll say it. - Sir, you'll have to make up an excuse..
..and divert the coast guards at Gorai tonight.
Okay?
I will shoot you, sir.
I won't say it even if you shoot me.
You're refusing us? I will cut off your nose.
No, not my nose.
Then I'll cut off your tongue.
If you do that, how will I speak? - Yeah.
You will say it, won't you - Of course I will.
I will. I will.
I will do just as you say.
Take some lessons, Ghorpade.
Take some lessons from him. - Yes, sir.
God bless you.
Sir. You asked for a knife.
Here's the knife. - Thank you.
But, sir. You've diverted the police.
How will they catch Napoleon now?
We don't catch Napoleon tonight.
We've to catch Napoleon tonight. - No worry.
Even if the police manage to catch Napoleon..
..we won't find his other agents in India.
We'll prove that capturing Napoleon was Vishwas' plan.
Yes. - And Vishwas' crimes will be pardoned.
Then he'll become a hero tomorrow. - Yes.
Not tomorrow, but the day-after..
..we'll arrest Napoleon, his entire gang..
..and all his agents red-handed.
Wow! What a plan, sir.
Napoleon! Surrender yourself.
One year of hard work..
..was foiled in a single night.
All because of one traitor.
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who is the traitor amongst you..
..that informed the police?
The police...arrived their coincidentally, sir.
It was no coincidence!
They came prepared.
Thank God I managed to save this bag.
Otherwise, everything would've been over.
This mission can't be completed..
..without this bag.
Find that traitor.
Otherwise, I will kill all of you.
Sir.
I doubt someone.
You doubt me? Me?
I could've been arrested as well.
I could've died in the police firing as well.
How could you forget Gundappa sir..
..who risked his life to bring you that CD?
Me.
I had to kill two policemen and I didn't hesitate..
..just for your CD, Gundappa sir.
But you still doubt me.
Me!
Hello, aunt.
You here? - Yes.
These goons abducted you too.
They can't abduct me.
I came here willingly. - What?
And that day, I brought your truck safe and sound..
..from the warehouse!
And also brought your enemy Khare.
But you still..
My son's doing a good job here. - Good job?
Did you join the gang along with your son?
If you still don't trust me..
Then it's better that I die.
Then it's better that I die.
My son's working for the police.
Police!
But, Gundappa sir..
..I don't want you to shed innocent blood.
That's why I'm going to kill myself.
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun. Give me the gun.
You give it. Give it.
Stop it, Vishwas.
Gundappa, what do you think?
Sir. I think it's a sin to doubt this boy.
Sorry, Vishwas.
Boys, come back.
Go. Go.
Sorry. Sorry. - It's okay.
Sorry, Vishwas.
I'm really sorry. Forgive me.
It was a mistake. - Its okay.
No problem. Go.
Don't drive me away. - I'm not angry.
I am sending you with happiness. Happy, happy.
Go, go, goodbye.
Mom just told me.
I don't care what your mom said to you.
Your mom said that the police..
Don't try to threaten me.
I cannot marry you. - What?
I've things to do for uncle Gundu.
Learn, Ghorpade. Learn from him. He's our benefactor.
He's our God.
How much longer are you going to fool that stupid Gundu?
Your mom has told me everything..
..that you're working for the police.
You're fooling everyone here. - No.
Now, together we'll apprehend the entire gang.
Yahoo! - See. I am right.
Why are you quiet? Say something.
Now it's their turn to say.
Come on.
The boss has called you. - Come.
Hello. Hello. We're caught now, Kajal.
Only God can save us from Napoleon's wrath now.
The one who listens to me, protect my honor.
Gundappa. What've you got to say now?
Sir, it'll be a sin to trust this boy.
I want to shoot him. - Enough.
Do you two have anything to say? - Yes.
I'm very, very sorry sir. - Hey!
I mean, we're very, very sorry sir.
We made a mistake.
I didn't know there was a camera up there.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have said what I did.
Lovely India. The adorable couple together.
And in the Yoga pose.
Stop it, Guruji. - Why should I?
We've already fooled uncle Gundu..
Now there's going to be celebrations.
Singing and dancing.
Stop this charade.
Shut up!
Why didn't you tell me?
Who's this new character, Jackie Shroff type?
Boys. Ready to fire!
Sir...I've one last wish...before I die.
What?
I want to hear the 'Gayatri Mantra' before I die.
Where do we get the 'Gayatri Mantra' from?
I have it, sir. I have it. On my phone.
See. You can hear it too.
It'll wash away some of your sins.
And we'll leave this world.
Fine, fine, hurry up. - Thank you, sir. Thank you.
Come on, everyone close your eyes.
We're going to die anyway, why close our..
Just close your eyes!
Shut your eyes.
What is happening? - Why can't I see?
Don't shoot me.
Open your eyes. - Why?
Close the doors. Don't let them run.
Run!
Come on, quickly.
I won't let you go. I will catch you.
Caught one, sir. - Idiot, this is my hand.
Hey, here.. here.. here.
Close the doors.
That way. - Sir, caught one.
It's me again. - It is you. - Sorry, sir.
Where is everyone?
Close the door on the left.
That's the shortcut.
Left! Left!
Where are you going?
Where are you going? How will you run away like that?
I can see everything.
Vishwas! Stay there. Stay there.
They escaped.
Don't just stand there, find them.
They took my bag too. - Which bag, sir?
My bag's essential for my mission.
Go. Get Vishwas' mother and Khare. - Yes, sir.
Dog!
Who kept the door open?
He escaped.
He took the mother along.
Sir, he's written something here.
So read it.
""The food here is really pathetic.""
""Please change the cook, Joint Commissioner Khare.""
Fool. - No, sir. He's absolutely right.
I've complained about this too.
The food's really pathetic. - Shut up!
Sir. - Yes. - Inspector reporting, sir.
What's the news?
Gundappa's den is empty, sir. - What?
They've fled. - Keep informing.
Yes, sir.
This isn't cocaine, sir. - What?
It's powder.
Are you sure? - 100% sure, sir.
Yes, Vishwas. Where are you?
Sir, we've escaped from Gundappa's den. - Very good.
We've escaped too.
And mom? - She's fine.
And Kajal? I sent Kajal to meet up with you.
Yes, she's here too.
She's with your mother. Both are under police protection.
Listen to me.
Napoleon's tricked us.
That truck wasn't filled with cocaine.
It was some bogus powder.
That means 'Mission White Elephant' is something else.
Sir, whatever it is, it's in a black bag.
And that black bag's with me. - Very good.
Get that bag to Crime Branch Special Unit Zone 8!
That's where I am. - Yes, sir.
I am not a policeman, but Napoleon's man.
Hello. - We've abducted your mother.
Get that black bag back to Vasai Fort in one hour.
Once you're there, I'll give you further directions.
You've only 60 minutes.
If you try to act smart, you will never find your mother again.
Seal the entire city.
Set up check-posts. - May I come in, sir?
Come, Vishwas.
Vishwas, there's bad news for you.
I know, sir.
Napoleon has kidnapped my mother.
How did you know?
He just called, sir.
He said, ""If I don't return him this bag in an hour..""
""..he will kill my mother"".
Here, sir.
Yet you brought this bag here.
Mom always said, ""Duty comes first, relations later"".
So, I've done my duty..
..now I'm going to save my mother.
Wait, Vishwas.
Go give them this bag.
Sir? - I know we lagged in protecting your mother.
But now Mumbai Police will do its best in saving her.
Go. - But, sir, this bag..
Trust me, we will handle everything.
Now go fast.
I kept the police engrossed with cocaine.
And diverted their complete attention on you, Gundappa.
And quietly, cleverly fixed bio-chemical weapons..
..at four important places in the city.
That's my real mission.
Mission White Elephant.
Bio-chemical blast!
An RDX blast kills only those that are in proximity.
But a bio-chemical blast will also kill those...
...who are safe in their homes.
Because bio-chemical is a liquid.
It will turn into gas right after the blast.
And spread a dangerous, incurable disease through air.
In the entire city.
Your son, my enemy's here.
Savitri?
You...are still alive.
That means...
Vishwas..
I...
I looked everywhere for you, Savitri.
You're dead for us. - No.
No.
Don't say that, Savitri.
Look, once again we're..
You, me and our son.. - Mine.
Vishwas is my son.
Only mine.
You've no relation with me.
I do, Savitri.
We share blood ties.
And even you can't change that.
You've the bag, Gundappa sir.
You can punish me in any way you want.
But let my mother go.
First let us complete our mission.
Mission White Elephant.
This bag contains a computerized detonator.
Once it's connected with our computer..
..it will trigger numerous blasts in the city.
And people will rot to death.
Rot to death!
Yes. Take a left after one kilometre.
Take a right after three kilometres.
Sir. I've set the timer for the bio-chemical weapon.
I've the set the timer to 20 minutes.
All the bombs will explode in 20 minutes.
What happened to the tracker?
Just a minute, stop!
You informed the police.
Now you and your mother will have to die, Vishwas! - Gundappa!
No one moves.
Or I will shoot.
Shoot me.
Don't move.
I said...
I will shoot.
Shoot me.
That's the punishment for a sinner like me..
..that I die..
...by the hands of my son.
What is this nonsense?
Fate..
..has played a joke on me, son.
I..
Savitri.. - Don't utter my mom's name.
My father died when I was a kid. - That was a charade.
I can't believe my eyes either.
After all these years..
Ghorpade. - Sir.
Switch on the monitor.
""You're still alive..""
""That means...
...Vishwas..""
""I searched...
..everywhere for you, Savitri.""
Father..
Give me a hug, son.
I've yearned so long for this.
I don't want anything else.
Just stop the police.
I will go with you and surrender myself.
So that you become famous.
My son becomes famous.
That's my request. That's all.
I want additional forces.
Send the backup immediately.
Vishwas.
Yes, Vishwas.
Sir, Napoleon's ready to surrender. - What?
Stay there.
I'm bringing him to you.
OK.
Thank you, son.
Thank you!
I...missed you a lot, father.
Why did you leave me?
I am sorry, son.
I am sorry, I made a big mistake.
I made a big mistake.
Sir, you're a fantastic actor.
Even I was deceived for a moment.
Just imagine, sir. Even me.
Hello, Captain. Keep the chopper ready.
I'm arriving in an hour. - OK.
Right now.
Get ready to leave. - Yes, sir.
Gundappa. - I am coming.
I..
What's wrong with him?
Sir, there's another one there.
Sir, there another one.
Hey girl. What are you doing?
Nothing much.
I just deactivated all the bombs..
..that Gundappa sir had activated.
That's it. - How did she come out?
I brought her out, papa. For helping me.
But, I..
Vishwas?
You might be my father..
..but I'm a better actor than you.
You put up a charade..
..so that you can cause blasts in the city and flee.
And I put up a charade, so that..
..I can stop the blasts and apprehend everyone.
So, Napoleon. How was it?
Cool!
You won't survive either, son.
Hands up! Don't move.
Throw down your weapons.
We already did, sir. - What?
You already did? - I made them do it, sir.
Very good, Vishwas. Very, very good.
Very, very bad.
Because I still have my weapon.
Come on, Commissioner. Throw down your weapon.
Throw it.
Yes. Yes.
And, Vishwas. Throw down your gun too.
Very good, Gundappa.
Very good. - You see, sir.
This commissioner's always out to get me.
Hang on. - What happened?
Take this. Take this. Take this. Take this.
Help!
Save me! Save me!
Save me!
Ghorpade! - Yes, sir.
What sir?
You dare hit a policeman.
What are you doing, idiot?
Are you crazy?
Oh gosh!
Oh my! Do you want to kill me?
You..
Ghorpade.
Kill him. - OK, sir.
Ghorpade. - Yes, sir.
He's a policeman.
Kill him. - Yes, sir.
Ghorpade. - Yes, sir.
He's one of us, kill him. - Yes, sir.
Ghorpade. - Yes, sir.
Who do you work for?
For you, sir. - Then?
Ghorpade. - Yes, sir.
Who pays you? - You do, sir.
Ghorpade. - Yes, sir.
What uniform do you wear? - The police uniform, sir.
Ghorpade. - Yes, sir.
Who pays for your innerwear? - You do, sir.
Ghorpade. - Yes, sir.
Traitor. - Disloyal.
Double-crosser. - Two-timer.
Sir, did I do the right thing?
Serves people like him right.
All the best. - Same to you.
No!
Catch him.
Where am I? - Ghorpade.
Yes, sir. - Come here.
Where's Napoleon?
And this way, Vishwas Rao has set an example..
..by getting his father arrested.
And soon, after completing his training..
..he will join the Mumbai Police Force. - Yes.
And on behalf of the government..
..Vishwas Rao will be presented with the Bravery Award.
Vishwas Rao.
Congratulations. - Thank you, sir.
Sir..
I would like my mother to honour me with this award.
If you.. - Of course.
Call her.
I would like to request Vishwas Rao's mother..
..to come on stage and honour him with this medal.
Mom.
Hello. Here.
Take this.
""I'll tell the world everything my mom taught me since I was a kid.""
""That day will surely come..""
""..when you will be proud of me.""
""That day will surely come..""
""That day will surely come..""
""All I want is for you to trust me, forever, mom.""
""Forever..""
Mom.
My mom actually deserves this medal.
Today I'm standing here..
..because of her.
I always wanted to be an actor.
Today, my mom...
...made me a real-life hero.
It took me time to understand..
..that a real hero..
..works hard for the people.
Risks his life for the safety of the people.
Like the police.
The real hero.
Thank you, mom.
Thank you!
Guruji, you're so late.
The function's already over. Look, what I got.
You're on a roll.
Look there. Not that way, this way. Look here.
He's a rich producer Motwani..
..and wants to sign you as a hero.
He's got cash and cheque.
I'm not going to work in films anymore.
What are you saying? - Yes, Guruji.
Everything a hero does in films..
..I did all that in real life.
Mother and son emotion. Father and son clash.
Fighting the villains. Dialogue delivery.
Romancing the heroine. Dancing with the item-girl.
I did everything, Guruji.
Now I'm joining the police force.
Come, let's go meet mother. - Wait a minute.
You and your police job.
Do you know what a hero earns at the end of the day?
He has cars, bungalows, bank balance.
And what is good about your police job?
And what will you have in future?
Mom!
I'll have my mom!
Yogi bhai! Yogi bhai! What happened?
He won't work in films anymore.
Where are you going? - But why?
Through the poster emerges the hero.
Now he's a real life hero.
He no longer cares about the poster.
But, Yogi bhai, what about us now?
What? - What about us now?
Us?
Salman! Shahrukh!
Hrithik!
We'll have to settle for one of them.

This story begins
as all stories begin.
It was a dark and stormy night.
Lightning streaked the sky.
The clouds rumbled ominously.
And a man named Bipin...
was coming home
with a little orphan.
Bipin lived with his
termagant of a mother.
And his wife who was
even more of a terror.
In her world,
every relationship was a deal.
Her world was a marketplace.
And in her marketplace, a child with
no antecedents counted for nothing.
Bipin's mother and wife rejected
the child at first glance.
But thanks to her survival instinct...
the little one would not be budged.
- Alert! Alert!
- Danger!
Bipin never told anyone where the girl
came from or why he brought her home.
Never. And the termagants
asked quite often.
One day, Bipin found out...
that his motherless
tyke was a baby owl.
Her friends were bats.
He tried everything he could...
but he could not get her to sleep,
perchance to dream.
She stayed awake all night.
But all day, she was awake too.
But Bipin was not one to give up.
One day, he gave his princess a box.
It was a dream box.
Dreams?
Every day, he drew her a new dream,
just for her.
All this in the forlorn hope that
his princess would one day sleep...
and learn the joy of dreaming.
But every princess needs a prince
to coax her to the Land of Nod.
""Riding a whim, I'm on my way...""
""We were meant to meet,
some day, some way...""
""Riding a whim, I'm on my way...""
""We were meant to meet,
some day, some way...""
""Riding a whim, I'm on my way...""
Who is this numbskull'?
Sorry, Daddy-O, I'm...
What d'you mean 'sorry'?
Can't you look where you're going?
Blind turn back there, right'?
Didn't see it.
You aren't blind, are you'?
I said, sorry, innit'?
Hey, blind bat,
what are you looking at'?
Look at me and talk.
You didn't see my car when you had to.
Now look at me and talk.
Yo, I said sorry three times.
What more do you want'?
C'mon give one back.
What'?
Return a sorry.
What'?
Until you return
one of my 'sorries', I won't move.
Who returns apologies?
You do. Give one back or I stay put.
- I've dealt with his kind before.
- Stay in the car.
- Let me deal with this.
Get this bike out of the way.
Won't. Whatcher gonna do about it'?
- Hey.

<i>- Hey-ey-e'!

Do you know who I am'?
Why would I want to know?
Bipin!
Bipin? Who's the hot broad'?
Down, boy.
Geetu, wait in the car.
Let me handle this.
Where are you going, Eesha'?
- To help?
- But Eesha...
Can I help?
Eesha, it's okay.
<i>I'll</i> manage. Wait in the car.
Hey, Eesha!
Hi.
Hey!
Wow!!
Triumph Thunderbird Storm,
270 degree firing interval.
Really? I thought it was 250 degrees.
270, Beeps. Parallel Twin.
You know so much about so much.
Interested in bikes, are ya'?
In everything.
Alia.
Ooh la la. Alia.
Jagjinder Joginder.
- Who is this'?
- It's me, sir.
So you had to tell me in the end.
Whatever, dude.
Look, lemme move my belly-shover.
That's right, move it along.
You lot, get in the car.
You, get that out of the way.
One sorry on your account, Daddy-O.
Move!
Love you too!
It's a fairy-castle!
It's beautiful!
Are you happy, kiddo?
Yes Dad, it's perfect!
Why wouldn't it be'?
Mummyji has paid for it.
And now if you're done with
your little lovefest, can we go in'?
Mummyji will be waiting.
My picture small?
That small?
That small?
OMG!
This is like K3G!
Totally!
<i>Hi, Ria, Pia.</i>
- Hi, FTB.
- Hi, FTB.
Oh sorry... FTB?
- Father of the bride!
- Father of the bride!
Father of the bride is in trouble.
Why is my photograph so
small on this magazine cover'?
Give me answers!
Tell her, no'?
I want answers!
- Bipin will know, Mummyji.
- Where is he'? Get him here. Now.
I've emptied my pockets
for this wedding and this ingrate...
- They're right when they say...
If you meet a snake and an
Arora on the road, kill the Arora.
Mummyji, you're also an Arora.
Straighten that pink paw.
You should have been
squished out at birth.
Snakelet!
<i>Yes, Mummy.</i>
Snake in my bosom!
<i>Yes, Mummy.</i>
Cobra.
<i>Yes, Mummy.</i>
What do they call that snake,
which coils about you and kills you'?
A boa constrictor, Mummyji.
Boa!
Bipin! Thank God!
Bipin, where are Eesha and Alia'?
Waiting for you.
Bipin, you should know...
- What?
- Take it off.
Take what off'?
Your shades.
Bye, Mummyji.
Good morning!
Where were you'?
I've been waiting for you forever.
Look at this magazine. Why
is Fundwani's photo bigger than mine'?
Fundwani paid for the photo.
We paid for the article.
But now we'll all be one big happy
family so what's the difference, Nlummyji'?
It makes a difference! I don't care
if he's paid for the entire magazine.
Who's paying for this wedding?
You are, Mummyji. Who else can'?
Explain that to him.
Why do you think I've
brought that fatso up'?
When you sacrifice the goat,
you eat the meat.
- Come on... come on...
Come on, BTB! BTB!
BTB!
Deep breaths, deep breaths...
What is BTB'?
- Come on!
- Bride-to-be!
- Breathe in... breathe in.
I can't. You've cut
it way too small, Uncle.
Shut your face. I opened it out
four inches in Delhi and then it fit.
But now you've come
here and swelled up again.
This is a brilliant
sketch of your Robin.
Very nice.
Thanks.
They' re for Eesha.
- You can do it.
Try the upper hooks.
- Hi baby.
- Hi Mama.
Say no.
Do you know?
The average chocolate has
the legs of eight insects in it.
Eight!
As they make the chocolate,
the bug feet fall in.
This is no average chocolate, Alia.
It's a fact.
Have another one, after this, okay'?
How much are you going to stuff her'?
This won't fit her.
So what'? Make a new one.
This is one of my best, okay'?
Okay guys,
it's time for the breakfast rehearsal!
Breakfast rehearsal?
Mummyji is waiting.
Babla, who are you shooting?
Auntie Geetu.

And my parathas?
And my parathas?
Mummyji! Parathas, here?
Do you want me to starve to death'?
Who's going to make parathas here'?
Will an aaloo paratha work for you,
Kamlaji'?
And don't forget your
blood pressure medication.
Your pressure's been a bit high,
hasn't it'?
""What a hottie-hottie!""
""What a hottie-hottie!""
""Yeah!""
You!

On the right, white flowers.
- Okay, JJ, we got it.
- Hey, Tenthouse.
How may I help you, sir'?
Who do you think you are'?
No one sir.
Just a creature. No special features.
Oh yeah'? And out there,
you were all muscles and machismo.
Outside, you were also a
different man, weren't you, Daddy-O'?
What do you mean?
Outdoors'? He roars!
In his house, he's a mouse.
So I changed as well.
Take it or leave it.

- Hey JJ, check those flowers.
Perfect...

Before the wedding.

""This is the crazy...""
This is the crazy...
Life is a b*tch!
""This is the crazy...""

You, Chinese?
<i>No, sir, Japanese.</i>
""This is the crazy...""
The Fundwanis are here.
""Crazy, man!""
Welcome! It is a pleasure
to do business with you, Mr. Fundwani.
This is the funtastic,
but Mummyji please call me the Harry.
This partnership is my pleasure...
for the whole Sindhi community,

Funtastic family.
Welcome, welcome to the family.
We are already family.
Every Sindhi is the family.
The Harry,
may I tell you a custom of our family?
Sure.
On the happy occasion
of this wedding...
we would like to gift you
as much gold as Eesha's weight.
25,000 x 90 = Oh. My. God.
- Come fast, my bro!
""Robin, my bro, Robin!""

PP.
PP.
PP.
<i>PP, Mummy-ji.</i>
What is PP'?
'Pairi pauna' (I TOUCH YOUR FEET).
'Pairi pauna'!
Touch his feet.
Nice. Nice. Must buy this property.
Hey no flirting now.
You can do all that after marriage.
Marriage reminds me:
Is everything organized?
Yes, sir.
Karan is coming, isn't he'?
Hiroo simply insisted.
Hiroo'?
Are you the crazy'?
You don't know Hiroo Aunty'?
She's Karen's Mumma.
Oh Karan Johar.
Yes sir. He was inquiring after you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Of course, of course. He's my fan,
my fan, y'know.
- All the rich people are my frands.
- All?
- And the rich people are all Sindhi.
- After all, I am the Chairman of
the UN Sindhi Association.
- Oh, UN'?
That's why we couldn't
have the wedding there.
Or we'd have to invite Lilibet, see'?
Too much publicity.
Don't like“.
Lilibet?
Queen Elizabeth'?
Queen Elizabeth'?
Queen Elizabeth!
Is she Sindhi too'?
Of course, she's Sindhi.
Her son's pushing sixty
but he still lives with her.
You're looking good.
I know.
The world's best people are Sindhis.
That explains this locket.
S for...'?
Let me guess. Let me guess.
S for Superman?
No!
One more chance.
S for Scarface.
Not at all!
Last chance.
S for Son-in-law?
No, ya loser, S for Sindhi.
The sunny Sindhi, the Sindhi as suns.
For me'?!
Come, come, come.
Baby doll!
Bipin, I love you!
What a welcome!
- How dare you touch my brother'?
- Sir...
- No, let it be. Don't want
to spoil the celebration.
Sir...
- I'm talking to you. Look at me.
- How did you dare'?
- Sir!
Hold on.
<i>I'll</i> look after this.
Hey you!
Won't you fight'?
- Talk to me.
Not for four hours after a work out.
- What you think of yourself?
Why'?
Your muscles tend to be tender, right!
- How did you dare'?!
That's my Dad.
You want to fight'?
Come.
Let it go.
What happened'?
Beeps.
Kiddo, you stay out of this.
Look, what you're doing is not right.
- What'?
- Hey!
- Let it be, brother.
Hey!!!
Dishoom!
What's happened'?
What's going on'?
Nothing, Daddy-O.
You lot enjoy yourself. I will resign.
You will do no such thing.
I said I would resign
and I will resign.
Who are you to resign?
We're going to sack you.
And who are you to sack him'?
Mummyji, he pushed me and I fell down.
No, Uncle, you...
Shut up.
Orphans shouldn't open their mouths.
- Mummyji, this man gave me a shove.
- He's had a drop too much.
- Mummyji, I warned you about this...
Mummyji, I withdraw my resignation.
I was going to come to you
to ask about tomorrows programme.
- Everyone, come and meet me.
I have something important to say.
- Mummyji, he was rude to Vinay.
He shoved him about.
If he had given you and
Vipul a couple of good ones,
I would have given him a bonus.
- You doofoids...
if JJ goes, this wedding stops.
And if the wedding doesn't happen,
you know what will happen?
If the wedding doesn't happen,
the business deal falls through.
Right.
She has more brains than
the three of you put together.
She is the only one
who can take my place.
I don't want your place.
Give your company to whom you want.
Give it to Vinay. Give it to Geetu.
But after this,
don't call Alia an orphan.
Ooh, did that bother you'?
I'm your mother.
Can't you do that much for me'?
Bear with it for a few days more.
You know we haven't
a red cent in the bank.
And under the Companies Act,
all of you are already bankrupt.
We've put the leavings
and scrapings into this deal.
If Fundwani breaks off the deal,
you'll spend the rest of
your lives paying off the debt.
So go.
Enjoy the wedding. Make it happen.
Your dream for tonight.
You're a fine one!
A bomb! Another bomb!
Is she dead'?
Not so easy.
We'll kill her slowly...
I was thinking.
We should put a time bomb
under her wheelchair.
Not a word to a living soul.
- You going to stay there all night?
Another bomb in the next room.
That one might go off any time.
Okay, these dreams that I give you'?
Do you save them up or
do you ever actually dream them'?
As soon as I get to sleep,
<i>I'll</i> dream them all.
Promise?
Promise.
If someone were to get you to sleep,
I'd be able to sleep well too.
Beeps, you know the visually
challenged can't see their dreams...
they only feel them.
Okay Miss Google.
Anything else'?
No, that's all for today.
<i>Is the class over'?</i>
Ting ding ding ding.
Okay, thank you, Miss.
Beeps...
let's just run away.
- I want to.
One day, we'll just take off.
Promise?
Promise!
""Ooooh, sleep eludes me.""
""My heart deludes me.""
""Someone comes a-creeping.""
""And wakes the love that's sleeping.""
""But <i>I'll</i> be up all night.""
""My heart deludes me.""
""Someone comes a-creeping.""
""And wakes the love that's sleeping.""
""But <i>I'll</i> be up all night.""
Sonia?
Sonia?
- What?
- My bike keys, please?
- Can't sleep again?
- Yeah.
Where you off to'?
Nowhere particular.
In this darkness?
Hey, I'm not scared of the dark.
Boo!
Don't do that. Go to sleep.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
""Ooooh, sleep eludes me.""
""My heart deludes me.""
""Someone comes a-creeping.""
""And wakes the love that's sleeping.""
Hey!
Hey... suicide...
Stop right there. Hey jumper...
<i>I'm on way. Oye, excuse me.</i>
Don't go under. Hang on.
Almost there. There, Gotcha.
You' re safe now.
Saved ya.
You?
What are you doing in my bathroom'?
I was saving you.
From what'?
From drowning.
- Aren't you drowning?
- No.
Are you wearing anything?
Do you wear clothes to bathe'?
Huh?
- Are you still looking at me'?
- No.
Sorry...
No, it's cool...
May I sit here'?
Yeah... sure...
Thanks.
Come on, who swims
in the middle of the night?
I do.
The water is very wet, no'?
A cup of tea would make this perfect.
Just a minute. Here you go.
Here are two cups.
And now here's the tea.
Sugar?
Two spoons.
Two spoons?
As you wish.
These days, I'm cutting back.
Tea!
Thank you...
What was that'?
What'?
That'?
Oh him.
Scaredy cat. It's only a frog!
- Hold on to this.
- Give it here.
Who is he'?
Meet Ashok.
Why Ashok'? Why not Anarkali'?
He's a male frog.
This mark, here'?
It's bigger in male frogs.
- Nice.

This habit of bathing in
waterfalls... how did this start'?
That one.
Actually I'm an insomniac...
ls there a cure'?
Don't you know what insomnia is'?
No.
I don't get sleep at night.
What are you saying?
I don't sleep. I can't sleep at night.
What did you say, that word'?
Night'?
Before that. Some big word.
- Insomnia...
- That. I have that too.
Shut up.
I swear upon my mother's head.
I can't sleep either.
So what do you do all night?
I try but when I can't sleep.
You know when I was a kid,
I'd make kheer.
All nightlong.
Oh, you're a Sikh'?
- How do you know?
- I just saw you. In the flashback.
Well-spotted.
All nightlong'?
Right up to sunrise.
Why'?
There was a bulb in the kitchen.
It was kept on.
You afraid of the dark'?
Yes...

- Not at all...
- You are afraid of the dark.
Not at all.
Fraidy cat.
Stop it.
In the morning, you were
growling at Papa like a tiger.
And now you're afraid of the dark.
I'm afraid of the night,
not of monsters.
Hey?
What scares you about the night?
The night scares me about the night.
The night is the best time of the day.
Look, look, what's that'?
- Look, Fraidy Cat.
- Not a Fraidy Cat, okay'?
It's a horse and I want to go riding.
- You like riding'?
- Have you ridden a horse'?
Of course,
I've ridden herds of horses.
I'm really good.

What's going on'?
Whatever you say, sir.
WHAT IS THIS: News

Sorry, you said something?
- What's going on here'?

Twiddling'? I was just... asking
Kamlaji if she would like to dance'?
Yes, why not'?

You'll... dance'?
Of course Jackie
and I are best friends.

Michael Jackson.
Is Jackie a Sindhi too'?
Are you the crazy'?
Oh..sorry.. sorry..
Of course, he's Sindhi.
Those short pants he wears?
Keeps the cloth bills down.
He has diamonds on his gloves.
He dyes his hair black
and makes his face whitemSindhi!
He hasn't called in a while.
MJ... isn't he like D-E-D...

RIP, man!

The waltz is my favourite dance.

Take that.
Thanks, bro!
Jagjinder Joginder.
Yeah dude...
What's the dope on the bachelor party'?
It's not on my list.
Hmmm... list...
The thing is Kamlaji said...
Kamlaji is from the girl's side.
We're the boy's side.
And what we say has to happen,
has to happen.
Bachelor party has to happen.
- Has to happen!
- Has to happen!
I'm off to marry a buffalo.
Let me have some fun first.
Eesha is very sweet.
Exactly.
She's so sweet,
she's a whole flaking patisserie.
- Laddoo!
- Laddool!
Ta-da!
Sis'? What happened'?
Alia, I'm fat. I'm obese.
- Nonsense.
- I'm a balloon.
No.
You're so pretty. You're beautiful.
No. Why would a boy like
Robin marry a girl like me'?
Because he got lucky?
Their business is doing well...
and I'm just a clause in
a business deal. A big fat clause.
Did Robin say something, Sis'?
Then don't marry him.
Just don't.
Up to now, no one's
rebelled against Mummyji.
Not Papa. Not Uncle Vipul.
Not Uncle Vinay. No one.
How am I going to do it'?
No. Let the show go on.
I'm lucky I got a boy like Robin.
Sis, don't.
- Sis, stop crying-
- Go to sleep, now.
- Come on.
- I'm trying.
- All alert, all alert, all alert.
- All ready for Eeshafs Bachelor's Party'?
- We've kidnapped Eesha.
- Eesha on the way.
- Everyone's moustaches in place?
Eesha's here.
Guys be ready.
Three...
Two...

GO!
That made her happy.
Thank you.
You're welcome,
Mr. Alia.
I must say you're
looking rather handsome.
Beeps thinks so too.
Who?
That villain'?
Hey!
- He's very special.
- Specially villainous.
He was the one who took me in.
I was adopted.
So he chose me.
Other kids'? They just come along.
I'm very special, Mr. JJ!
JJ. Sorry but this name of yours.
Jagjinder Joginder.
Jagjinder Joginder.
What kind of name is that'?
There's a long story
behind my name.
Would you like to hear it, Mr. Alia'?
There you were saying you can't sleep.
What did you say you were'?
An lnsomaliac'?
So my dad's name was...

and my mother's
name was Jagjinder Kaur.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Where's Alia'?
Alia'?
Oh she and l... Last night...

""What a hottie-hottie.""
Hello?

God. Robin.
Come to jail, Sir.
What'?
Police station, Sir.
- Come let's go.
- Come please.
Let's go, let's go.
- He took his clothes off in a public place.
- Calm down, please.
No, no, he couldn't have done that.
Somebody else must have done it.
Look at his face.
Idiot... l mean... innocent.
- Bipin, bribe him!
- I'm sorry he broke the law..
Please, if we could quicken
up this whole thing...
and you can release this
boy and we can leave from here.
Because the entire
family is over here.
Daddy-o, you're getting nowhere.
Let me handle this.
Let me talk to them.
Everybody relax. Don't worry.
It's gonna be all right. We'll
handle it. Come here. Give me a hug.
Irritated?
Keep the old man outside.
What happened, Baby'?
They told me to go out.
He's gone in.
JJ my man...

Hold on!
What did you do'?
What did you do'?
I swear I didn't do anything.
I swear on Eesha's head,
I did nothing.
All night long,
I've gone bananas telling them...
I did nothing.
I didn't even touch those girls.
- Did I touch those girls?
- No.
Didn't touch those girls.
You shook your booty in golden
chuddies and you say you did nothing.
I was just moving them aside.
- I swear on Eesha. I swear on Eesha.
- Let me talk to them.
I can't tell you how
much I appreciate it..
JJ I must tell you...
the glass is soundproof..
Oh right. Of course..
How much longer can
you keep him there'?
We have to let him go JJ..
No James no. You have to
keep him for a bit longer.
You have to make him suffer.
You have to..
You have to make him cry..
Can you do that thing in Rambo?
You know where they take
that water hose and then they just...
do stuff like that to him.
May be we could open...
Things that will cause him pain!
What happened'?
It's 12:35.
Ok...
Yeah I think we should
keep him in for longer.
He should suffer.
Suffer some more because he's a creep.
Could you like give
him like life imprisonment?
Alia, are you mad'?
Life imprisonment. . Seriously'?
Why not'?
For strutting his stuff in a bar'?
Why not'?
I only got a one-day deal, kiddo.
Calm down Alia... calm down.
We have to let him go now..
Jagjinder Joginder,
my bro, my homie...
I have spoken to the officer.
Yes, yes'?
He'll let you go on one condition.
<i>I'll</i> do anything, anything.
He says you're not to so
much <i>as</i> look at another woman.

- You won't touch them.
You won't even look
at them on Youtube.
Or on Twitter.
Or Whatsapp...

I promise I won't.
I won't.
You will never again take
your clothes off in a club.
You will never work out again.
You will abstain from protein shakes.
And eggs.
You just won't eat any food.
And never take off that shirt.
Or your trousers.
I agree. Whatever he wants.
No eggs. The devil take all eggs.
Officer, he's agreed
to your conditions.
You will never wear gold again.
Bro?
Cool down, Bro.
They're not Sindhis, Bro.
Forgive them.
- And you know what'?
- I even had a dream.
You know snails can
sleep for three years.
Three years'? Okay.
I think I'm now a snail.
Why'?
I can sleep now, Sis.
Last night?
I was out like alight. Right out.
- Out!
- Like real sleep, sleep-sleep'?
With bells and bobtails on.
Wow.
And you know,
he acts all big and macho...
but he's afraid of the darkness.
- Really?
- Really.

- Afraid.
Go away, choo, choo!
- Yesss...
Want some'?
Oh no!
OMG!
OMG to you too!
Want some'?

- What are you doing here'?
- Hanging. Checking tickets!
- What'll you do if I don't have one'?
- What'll I do'? <i>I'll</i> let you go...
Let's party in mid-air!
Entry is free for you, Daddy-o.
- Fancy something special?
- I don't want your stupid free entry!
- You are a fallen angel!
You're the one who's falling, Daddy-o!
I don't have a parachoooooot!
How are you liking it, daddy-0'?
I was loving it!
Don't take me on, Daddy-o!
I will. What'll you do about it'?
Really? Deal done'? Then
congratulations on the match, Daddy-o.
- What match'?
Gosh, he's piggy-backing on me now!
Now up we go, don't lose it, Daddy-o.
Idiot!
Cheers, cheers, cheers!
Oh my boy, cheers!
- I'm starving.
This is all non-vegetarian.
- So what's wrong, sister?
- On Tuesdays I'm vegetarian.
Me too.
Me too.
This is so badly organised!
Non-veg on Tuesday?
Boy! Cheers.
It's Tuesday and there's non-veg only.
This is the crazy.
It's my Tuesday also.
Guys, vegetarian food!
Mushrooms <i>&</i> brownies.
Like totally veg...
- Like organic.
- Like totally...
Like... where did you get them'?
Such sweet chaps.
They gave them to us totally free.
Hello everybody.
Hello... hello, hello...
Really very sorry for the delay.
Delay? Delay? Delay?
What's going on'?
It's our veggie Tuesday.
And all this is non-veg.
No, no, today is Monday.
It's Monday today.
In India, it's Tuesday. And we
choose not to eat non-veg on Tuesday.
All meat, no eat.
All meat, no eat.
What are you eating?
Mushroom.
Show me that.
Your attention, please.
These narcotropic substances...
can have an unexpected
and euphoric effect upon your body.
Do not think of them
as innocent things.
When they get in you, they reform
your mind and transform your system.
This cocktail will
set your blood a-leaping.
Yes, you heard that right.
Your innards will be blown.
Each bit of your body
will become a celebration.
Here. Flock and roll will play!
And there the bhangda breaks out!
The clouds from the
skies begin to speak.
Your fine-tuned mind
turns into a minefield.
Your moods turn into floods.
Inside, it's technicolour stereophonic.
Outside, it's a family picnic.
For the next few hours, you will
enter a new zone of experience.
Please enjoy the ride.
This is not for the weak of heart.
Meat no eat.
Meat no eat.
This is the crazy.
This is so not...
So badly organized.
On Monday, it's Tuesday.
And the food's on the wrong day.
If it is Tuesday,
it must be vegetarian...
So badly organized.
On Monday, it's Tuesday.
And the food's on the wrong day.
- So badly organized.
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.
- And the food's on the wrong day.
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.
- On Monday, it's Tuesday.
Have you seen my legs'?
I've lost my legs.
Find my legs.
Let's go look there.
Everybody follow me.
Hello?
I can't get a signal here.
Hello...
- Straighten those paws.
Hello!
Hello? Hello! Hello?
Hello.
Is this a celebration?
<i>Yes, Mummy.</i>
Shut your gob.
This is no celebration.
It's a business deal.
Go find out if we have
the new logo for Splendiferous.
<i>Yes, Mummy.</i>
Hey, she's got even fatter.
And this we're going
to have to weigh in gold'?
- Mr. God'? Take this monster to
your breast or I might do your job.
- Yes, Mr. Bhatia'?
Bipin Arora here.
One second, one second please.
Okay, that logo. Is it ready'?
So please send it to me.
Thank you.
Hello?
Prabha'?
Hello!
Prabha, my love.
Hey, our daughter is
twenty-five years old now.
Alia.
I gave her the name you chose for her.
Her nose is just like yours.
And as she gets older, she shows
the same streaks of craziness as you.
But she's also weirdly wise.
When I'm with her,
I feel you around me.
She's a happy thing.
But ever since you went away...
the moon doesn't look the same.
I never told her about you, but I made sure
she never missed out on a mother's love.
Sorry...
We met in flying school.
Looking at the deal
between Bipin and Geetu...
it didn't seem like there
was a romantic bone in his body.
He was capable of love
but only for his daughters.
No one could ever dream...
that Bipin was once a lover-boy.
That he once had dreamed
of becoming Tom Cruise.
- Then Papa died and I had
to take over the family business.
- I couldn't bring Prabha home to
Mummyji, she had a 'deal' for me.
- I had to marry Geetu
for the business.
By then I was not aware that
Prabha is Pregnant.
This is so cool.
I'm illegitimate.
Alia'?
This is so cool, Beeps.
I'm illegitimate!
This is so much better
than being adopted.
Alia'?
I'm illegitimate.
This is so cool...
Oh, nowl get it.
I always had real-dad
type feelings for you...
but no real-Mum type
feelings for your wife. Right?
Real Papa.
I look like my Mum'?
Your eyes are the same.
Yeah'?
Your hands.
Really, hands?
Yes, hands.
Hmm, hands.
I think... nose too'?
No, nose looks like your mums.
Nose looks like my mum.
- Ears.
- Ears.
So cool.
Tomorrow, a real father-daughter
team is going to party.
What happened'?
One thing I don't get.
Why did Tenthouse keep
this bit of the video a secret'?
If he wanted, he could
have exposed this to everyone.
He didn't. Why didn't he'?
He must have had his own agenda.
What reason could he have'?
No, no...
He was protecting you.
Because he was protecting me.
That's it.
He was protecting you
because he was protecting me.
Because he loves me.
What'?
You cracked it Beeps.
You really cracked it there.
I said nothing of the kind.
No you just said it. You cracked it.
Nothing. I said nothing of the kind.
What did I say'? I said nothing.
You said he loves me.
No.
- You said that.
- No.
He loves me.
- Alia, Alia.
- You're so smart.
Kiddo, I said nothing of the kind.
Alia, Alia.
Alia!
Kiddo, he's a hornswoggler.
Soniaaa!
Ketchup!
Papaji!
Alia'?
Yes?
You wanted to go riding, no'?
Yes.
Tomorrow.
Morning. Six am.
You, me and a horse.
Okay.
- Great.
- It's not necessary.
You don't only do what is necessary.
You also do some things
because they make you happy.
- Like deep.
- Like totally.
Okay?
What's with this 36'?
What is it'?
Think about it.
Okay.
- Good night.
- Good night.
It's different.
It's different?
Hey, Tenthouse!
You think you're going
to take her horse riding'?
I am. What will you do about it'?
I am going to take her horse riding.
Sure. Do that.
You watch your step.
Daddy-o, this is only a rehearsal.
One day, I'm going to get me
on a white horse and whisk her off...
and whafre you going to do then'?
You come with your white horse
and <i>I'll</i> show you what <i>I'll</i> do.
Okay!
"" Okay!
"" Okay!
<i>- Oye.
- Oye.</i>
<i>- Oye.
- Oye.</i>
Good night then.
- Sleep well.
- Okay.
Hold on, excuse me, one moment.
Yes?
What's that about 36'?
Think about it.
Thirty-six.
Think.
Good night.

get anywhere near Alia.
Oh God!
Looks like <i>I'll</i> have
to go riding with Beeps.
It's cute.
<i>Array Tenthouse'.!</i>
Oh no!
<i>Yikes...</i>

Nothing like that is going to happen.

Hmmm...

he might be my step-father one day.
Look, look, his next target.
Look, he's so sweet to Eesha.
So sweet to Eesha, my tush!
Flirt!
Roadside Romeo!
Don't believe me, do you'?
<i>I'll</i> show you. I have proof.
Hard evidence.
Hello hello, hello, one two three, one
two three, testing, testing, testing.
Ladies and gentlemen.
There's been another romance
brewing in this romantic atmosphere.
A romance that has
been kept hidden from us.
Just a second, ladies and gentlemen!
Presenting, his firecracker!
One second.
Here you are.
OMG... she's like old.
I am younger than her!
- What's happening, Tenthouse'?
- Love you firecracker.
- What's happening?
- A marriage is happening.
Here too.
Namaste-ji, Sat Sri Akal, CC to all.
<i>Hey Mr. Nora, remember we met'?</i>
I' m Khushwant Kaur.
Your daughter's the
one getting married, right'?
A hundred thousand
blessings on her sweet head.
Thank you.
Daddy-O, meet my CEO.
I told you.
Everything under control, Gran'?
Not bad, not bad.
We've got too much chole.
But no one can make kheer like you.
Tell me what's with you'?
The balloon boy went missing
so I'm blowing these up myself.
I've got to go.
The band is here but the boy's side
want hip hop songs, the silly berks.
Gran, gran, hold on a moment.
MY phone'?
I want to talk to my grandmother.
Gran, I think I could sleep now.
- What are you saying?
That frog girl'?
You're a wonder, Gran!
Bring her to me.
Of course.

- What is this we are doing, Alia'?
Wait, it has to dry.
Then we peel it.
I can't believe you've never put glue
all over your hands and let it dry.
- Right.
- And what happens now?
Wait. Peel and see.
Oh wow.
- Do it, do it.
- Oh God, that's disgusting.
My skin is peeling away, doctor.
Please help me, doctor.
I know. You want a puff.
What's this'?

Nothing?
So let's break the darned thing.
Mummy and I would dunk
this in warm milk and eat it.
Where... she'?
<i>Eh'?</i>
What'?
Didn't get that'?
Where is she'?
Where is she'?
Where is she'?
Mummy'?
One night,
we were playing hide-and-seek.
I counted to hundred.
When I went to look,
they weren't there.
They were picked up,
made to vanish, in the riots.
I never saw them again.
After that, did you ever play'?
What'?
Hide-and-seek'?
Let's play then'?
Let's.
Hello, wrong number!
ATTAC K!
Mummyji agreed to...
Do you know?
Alia sleeps with him.
Mr. Choksi, <i>I'll</i> come to your room.
Sir, whatever happens here stays here.
Run along.
<i>I'll</i> come to your room.
Okay, sir, as you say.
What rubbish!
It's not nonsense, Dad.
Alia sleeps with Jagjinder Joginder.
How dare he!
I'll kill him if he so
much as lays a hand on her.
Shut up, Papa.
Alia goes to sleep now.
She can sleep because of Joginder.
Alia didn't even know
what a dream was up to now.
Isn't that what you always wanted'?
That she should sleep,
perchance to dream?
Please don't separate them, Papa.
But he's not good
enough for her, my girl.
Maybe not.
But who will be suitable for Alia'?
Who will love her more than you'?
That means whoever comes along
will always be second-best, right'?
But you won't get a better
second-best than Jaginder Joginder.
What rot you talk.
There are much better boys.
Like the one you found for me'?
Like the one Grandma found for you'?
Will you let that happen to Alia too'?
If you stop her today, Dad,
Grandma will turn her into a deal too.
Will you be able to do anything then'?
Or even say anything?
You've never said a thing
but do it now. For Alia.
She's your favourite, isn't she'?
Okay, Dad, just come with me.
Come no'?
- Where?
- Come on.
Where, kid'?
Please.
Just look at them.
- Look at this empty theatre.
- That's what you call
conspicuous consumption.
In a hall which can seat
two thousand, twenty people sit.
Look at that gang of gold-diggers.
- Robin, you're the man!

I'm over here, you imbecile.
Yes.
I have this to deal with
here and Bipin over there...
He almost ruined the deal yesterday.
What are you doing?
The air-conditioning
is on so the fan...
Always arguing.
Let me get this wedding done...
and then <i>I'll</i> get you married,
my boysie-woysie.
Never mind. Show me the saris.
Can't do anything right.
How do you like this, Mummyji'?
I wouldn't give it to the servant.
This is something else, Mummyji.
Heaven forefend.
<i>This one is the best, Mummy.</i>
What is this manure'?
Mummyji, why talk about
such things when you're eating.
It's my mouth and <i>I'll</i>
use it the way I like.
Sloppy designer!
<i>Yuck, Mummy.</i>
Don't you yuck me, you upstart.
Come here and get yours. Come here.
Come here, you.
Come here, now.
MummYJ-i-
- Come here. Now.
- You're disobeying me'?
My lovely prince.
- Come here.
- No.
- You coming or not'?
- No, Mummyji.
- You coming or not'?!
- Mummyji.
MummYJ-i-
<i>Sorry Mummy.</i>
Mummyji'?
Mummyji'?
Mummyji'?
Mummy... tee hee heel.
Nonsense. Stop it.
Enough of this.
First we have to tell the Fundwanis.
No. Never.
A death in the family
means the wedding is off.
If the wedding is off,
the deal is off.
If the deal falls through,
you know what happens?
The lawyer is right.
We can't stop the wedding.
And then... think about Eesha.
What do we do'?
Shall we make a dash for it'?
This is our chance.
The decision is yours.
Whatever you decide, I'm with you.
Look, kiddo...
you don't have to compromise...
Looking very pretty-
Your father talks a lot of rot.
Didn't we compromise?
And we're still happy.
Girl, marriages work
only on compromises.
One second.
Just because Mummyji is gone doesn't
mean we abandon family tradition.
Right'?
We need the Fundwani funds.
And that Robin big-chest'?
He isn't so bad.
Get those bangles on.
<i>I'll</i> be right back.
You do not have to compromise.
<i>Six... seven... eight.</i>
Eight-and-a-half.
Eight-and-a-half!
What do we do with her'?
We keep her alive.
What'?
Not too dark.
This looks sexy.
The ladies, the gentlemen,
I present to you...
the flying marital mare!
- Love you, bro!
Ma'am, red wine'?
Or white wine'?
Ma'am'?
Mummyji, he's asking red or white?
Last chance. Last time. You're sure'?
Think about it.
Guys, the family needs this to happen.
And maybe Robin will
change after we get married.
Smile, Mummyji!
Everything under control'?
Mummyji, just because you're
dead doesn't mean you can't smile.
Come on, Mummyji...
<i>One two three... smile...</i>
PP.
How are you, Kamlaji'?
Mummyji what a joke!
Come on, Mummyji, smile!
Hey JJ!
Let me take a photo, me, me.
Now Mummyji will smile.
Really'?
- One... two... three...
- Come on, Mummyji, smile.
""Come my friends and sing for me,
for this night, I am a bride.""
""The guests have arrived
and the fire has been lit.""
""I am to marry this night.""
Oh my God!
Chill, Robin!
Alia, just unhook this'?
Huh?
Help me get this off.
The d u patta'?
Yes.
Are you sure'?
Yes, I'm sure.
Uncle, unhook that please.
- Eesha'?
Eesha, stop it.
- Unbutton me.
The ones at the back too.
Yes.
Please, get me out of this.
What are you doing?
Eesha?
God, I'm so hungry.
Hang on to this, Alia.
Look at me, look at me.
You're marrying me but
you can't even look at me'?
This is howl am.
And I am perfect the way I am.
I'm fat and I like it.
I love it actually and
I'm not even that fat, am I Alia'?
No!
I have lots of people in my
life who love me as I am, right Dad'?
Me.
Me too, Sis.
I love you.
So I'm going to live
my life as I like.
<i>I'll</i> marry someone
I choose or I won't marry.
I'm fat and if I choose <i>I'll</i> stay fat.
Or <i>I'll</i> lose weight.
Got it bro.
But as of this moment,
I reject you, Mr. Eight-Packs!
Eight and a half.
What is going on'?
Put this on, Kiddo.
If my daughter doesn't
want to get married...
no force in the world
is going to get her married.
Just shut up, Bipin.
You shut up too, Geetu.
Excuse me, excuse me please.
Full respect, boss.
Put this on, Daddy-O.
This is an insult.
- And what about Splendiferous'?
- One minute, please.
Eesha, Eesha my girl,
life is like this.
We often have to do
things we don't want to.
Please, Eesha, listen to me.
Eesha, child, please accept.
Why'?
Don't interfere, Vipul.
Why'? Do I not have feelings?
Don't say yes.
Because of all of you,
I've been living a lie.
What happened'?
- What happened, Uncle'?
- I'm... I'm... I'm...
- I'm gay!
- We know.
- You know?
- Yes.
I want to say something too.
Fm Pfeggers.
Preggers'?
Pregnant, Beeps.
The tutor'?
- Ramesh.
- Ramesh.
- OMG, this is like
so awesome...
- Like totally.
All that work down the drain.
- Excuse me.
Now that everyone's telling
THE TRUTH: I'm illegitimate.
- Alia.
Come on Beeps, let me tell
it like it is. I am Beeps' daughter.
With another woman.
- Wow, Dad!
And by the way,
Sis, I'm older than you.
- Really.
- Yeah.
Yes.
And I'm not even a priest.
- No. I'm not.
I'm a cricket commentator.
Ever since Sidhu has taken
to commentary, I've been out of work.
So I developed this spiel.
<i>How'?</i>
The pitch puts a damper on play, the
weather will hamper the way the boys play.
The Lanka batsmen are on the heavy
side but they show no playing pride.
India bats next, the bowlers
are hexed and the batsmen are vexed.
Swaha...
Enough of this nonsense!
This is no joke. It's business.
This marriage will happen.
Or I shoot to the kill.
Bro, I don't want to
marry as a business deal.
Shut up, Robin.
Mummyji, what is this Mummyji'?
Today no smiling, no talking?
Someone stop him.
Mummyji come on say some-
What'?
Mummyji is dead.
What'?
Whaat'?'?
Whaaat'???
Whaaaat'?'?'?'?
Now that Mummyi is officially dead,
this wedding cannot happen.
We regret to announce
the cancellation...
This wedding will happen,
Mummyji or no Mummyji.
The show must go on.
But The Harry, this man is no priest,
he's a cricket commentator.
How will he marry them'?
- Makes no difference.
Once they've walked around the fire
seven times, they will be married.
Come on Eesha, move it.
Hansa, move. Robin.
Move!
Move, move.
At the feet of Muthaiya,
lies Murlidhar.
Oh Sanghkara, why hit so hard'?
And our little man is a tub of lard.
Your daughter's getting married.
Be happy.
And Sachin is stumped
for a way forward.
What is this'?
Good going, Robin.
I'm going to fire a few shots too.
Before the wedding.
Before the wedding.
Mummy your cannon,
the hope of the nation.
I didn't shoot.
I fired.
No no no, not my bro.
Hands up. No one moves.
- I've always wanted to say that line.
ANOTHER ONE: We have you surrounded.
- That's just dialogue. Stay focused.
One more.
One more dialogue.
If you value your lives,
throw down your guns!
One more.
What would you know
of the value of marriage?
Superb.
That itty-bitty pistol?
Daddy-O, take it away from them.
No, please don't. This is... this is...
family possession. This is... this
is... my property, ancestral property,
my great grandfather
gave me this gun.
This is the crazy,
you are the Harry, I'm the Bipin.
We're all Sindhi and we speak
Sindhi and the world is Sindhi.
We have nothing in common.
- Keep it here.
- Yeah, thanks.
Only Sindhi.
Like the peach!
- Daddy-o, let's get out of here.
Shall we flee'?
Really'?
- Shall we run for it'?
- Let's.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Bro-bro-bruhhh.
One minute, hold on.
_ Run!
Uncle, come with us.
You go on ahead.
<i>I'll</i> cut them off here. Go.
A he-man.
- Thank you brother.
Come on, Beeps.
""Until night fell,
the night, the night.""
""Then they opened a bottle of liquor.""
""The whole thing became a mess.""
Harry Fundwani,
<i>I'll</i> just fire on you right now.
No, no, no.
It is rather heavy.
That's why I'm telling you,
darling, give it to me.
There was only one bullet in it.
- Come on chase them.
- Bro!
""One more peg, more or less""
""And everything became a mess.""
""Just that bottle of liquor made everyone's
heart beat that much quicker.""
""The relatives were
hugging each other.""
""They were acting just like brothers.""
""The relatives were
hugging each other.""
""They were acting just like brothers.""
""The relatives were
hugging each other.""
""They were acting just like brothers.""
Daddy-o, Daddy-o!
Daddy-O, the helicopter.
What better moment will you get'?
- Fly that chopper.
- Yes, come on!
Yes.
""This was no marriage, it was a deal.
And the deal was quite a steal.""
""The whole thing became a mess.""
""The whole thing became a mess.""
""The whole thing became a mess.""
- Okay, let's go.

Turned out to be a total steal.""
""What was supposed to be a sweet deal
Turned out to be a total steal.""
""Everyone's true nature was revealed.""
""Everyone's true nature was revealed.""
Who's going to pay me back'?
- Hey... wow.
- We're good.
We made it.
Alia, it's Uncle Vipul.
Safe.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
It's ok, it doesn't matter, chill.
Set me down anywhere you like.
- Where do I set you down'?
- <i>I'll</i> throw you out.
Your bro isn't going to be happy.
Bro will be busy paying his debts.
<i>- Huh'?
- Debt'?</i>
My bro is bankrupt.
- Bankrupt?
- He's skint.
What we had left,
we put into the wedding.
Now he won't even be able
to pay for my protein shakes.
So you lot were in
the same state as we were.
Shut up!
Look straight ahead.
The fool wants protein shakes.
Where to, Beeps'?
Far far away.
What'll we do there'?
We'll live!
And sleep.
<i>Oye .</i>
A dream'?
Beeps did this one'? Show me'?
It's between us.
Thank you, Papaji.
Mention not.
And that was how Bipin took
his two daughters, one son-in-law...
and one eight-and-a-half packs
specimen and managed a clean getaway,
He got away from a Splendiferous deal
and flew away to a splendiferous life.

Soni is a police officer who, following her divorce, lives alone in Delhi. She is friends with senior superintendent Kalpana Ummat, who lives with her husband Sandeep, who is a high-ranking officer in the Delhi police. Soni's ex-husband Naveen often visits her, trying to persuade her to rekindle their relationship but she is not interested.

One day, while on duty, Soni beats a street goon who tries to harass her. Kalpana reprimands Soni for her temperamental and impulsive behaviour, while also expressing concern about her safety. A day later at a check post, Soni again gets involved in a violent incident when she slaps a drunken navy officer who is driving without a licence and misbehaves with her.

The commissioner of police take disciplinary action against Soni for the check post incident. Kalpana tries to persuade Sandeep and her seniors against it, but Soni is transferred to the police control room and an inquiry is set up to look into the incident.

A few days later, Soni is brought back into the police after Kalpana's intercession. The two later go to a restaurant to relax. Soni goes to the ladies washroom, which has been occupied by a group of young men who are consuming drugs. She gets into a fight with them and injures her hand before they are arrested. One of the men is found to be the son of a minister's friend.

After the incident, Sandeep scolds Kalpana, holding her responsible for the fight. The arrested men are released immediately, while Soni is taken off duty and sent back to the control room. Kalpana on the other hand realizes that Soni is right and arrests the minister's friend's son knowing the consequences.",1662,"./data/raw/subtitles/all_srts/tt6078866.srt","Hey!

Come here.
Dismissed.
We agreed on something, right?
What were your orders?
Madam, this one went too far.
So why even bother with the protocols?
Go sit in the car.

Let's clear out.

You didn't eat last night?
Don't worry.
I'll just microwave it later.
You always have an answer to everything.

Can we not talk about this?
All right.
Thank you, Mr. Singh.
Yes.
Crime branch. Yes.
About to have my breakfast.
- Khushboo.
- Yes, madam?
- Could you bring me a glass of water?
- Yes, madam.
The missus is doing all right.
Working night-shifts these days.
Khushboo!
How is Nishu doing?
Good?
Hello, Mom.
- You're home?
- Yes.
- How are you?
- Fine.
All well?
- Has Sandeep left for work?
- Not yet. He's on the phone.
Okay.
- Has the sun come out yet?
- Yes.
- I want to get some sunshine today.
- Sure.
Give me your hand.
Oh, Lord!
Kalpana...
please change your
strange work-hours, dear.
Enough of this graveyard shift.
I wish, but I have a lot to do.
I don't care.
Delegate to your staff then!
What’s the point of having authority?
Let me tell you...
your father-in-law was a
devoted officer like no other,
but, there wasn't a day
when he wasn't home for dinner.
What I mean is,
you have responsibilities at home as well.
What is so funny?
Am I a jester or what?
How long will this madness go on?
You arrive and he leaves,
it's a never-ending cycle.
Like hide and seek.
All right, just relax.
Have you two no sense
of commitment to family?
Mother, I know you're hungry.
Have some breakfast.
Yes, don't get smart with me.
Khushboo! Bring another plate for Mom.
Now that you’ve been promoted
see if you can get
her the day shift assigned.
- Sir, she's lying, I did nothing wrong.
- Sir, this man molested me.
One at a time, please.
Madam, calm down.
Sir, you must arrest this liar!
One person at a time.
Please, madam!
- This man is a liar and a pervert...
- Silence!
You do realize you're at
a police station, right?
Don't create a scene!
Attach that medical report here.
- Sir, he's lying...
- Keep it down, will you?
- What's the matter?
- Let me explain, madam.
- He forced himself into my house...
- Madam, she's lying...
Everyone calm down and step back!
- Stay behind that line.
- Step back! All of you!
Behind that line.
- May I have your name, madam?
- Neeru.
Tell us exactly what happened.
As I was saying, he forced himself
into my house and attacked me...
Is he an acquaintance?
- He's our landlord.
- Madam, I...
- Your name, sir?
- Madam, believe me...
Your name!
Vishwanath.
Tell me what happened.
So, we've been his tenants for years.
It all started with him raising our rent.
I told him I'm already
struggling to make ends meet.
So, he offered to let us off
only if I sleep with him.
I never said that!
When I refused, he forced himself
into my house...
You depraved son of a bitch!
Silence!
Do not utter a sound
unless I ask you a question.
Yes, go on.
He threw himself on me and groped me.
I see.
- What about this man here?
- He is my husband.
- May I have your name, sir?
- Tilukaat.
Anyone else in the family besides you two?
We have a son.
- Was he at home?
- No, he was at school.
- And you?
- I was at the farmers' market.
Who called the emergency number?
Madam, I did.
I see.
When did you do it?
When I got back home
I saw this man forcing himself on my wife.
I never once...
You think I'm blind?
I caught you red-handed, bastard!
Enough of all this shouting!
If anyone shouts or cuts in again,
I'm throwing you all in the cell.
So you called the police. Then?
When I walked in, I saw
my wife resisting this man
and without wasting a second,
I called the police, madam.
I see. You may speak now, sir.
Madam, I've rented out a
small portion of my land to them.
- However...
- Where do you live?
In the same neighborhood.
Now, they've occupied
a much larger area than I had allotted.
He's making up stories.
He just wants to kick us out.
Miss, you've had your chance.
Please don’t interrupt.
When I told them I'll raise the rent,
this man turned hostile.
And this lady followed me
all the way to my house
creating a scene in the neighborhood.
Look, what this monster did to me, madam!
Do you still think I'm lying?
Please cover yourself.
- I asked for the medical report, man.
- Madam, we have a lot more to tell you.
Yes, I'm listening. Be patient.
- What about your family, sir?
- Madam, I have a wife and a daughter.
Madam, this man isn't the
real owner of the land either.
He leased it from the government,
with no permit to rent it out.
Madam, I've had it for years now.
Renting helps with
the income for my household.
- Believe me, I have done nothing wrong.
- ""Nothing wrong""? What a sick man!
He wants to steal a poor woman's home
and has assaulted her
in front of her husband.
- Keep it down, please.
- No, I won't keep it down!
I demand that you
arrest this man immediately!
Do not tell me how to do my job!
Sir, where did you say you were?
Farmers' market.
Since when do we have a
farmers' market on a Saturday?
Don't fool me with your theatrics.
I want everyone out!
- But, madam, we were saying...
- I don't want to hear another word!
Go sit outside, all of you.
Come on, move it!
No tea today?
Let me ask someone.
What do I do with them?
Clearly, the lady is
making up a false case.
The whole fuss is about the land.
See if you can broker a deal between them.
Okay.
The independent witness
wasn't even at the scene
so how can he give a statement?
Sir, if we're the only witnesses,
the case may seem weak.
I don't care! This is not the way.
See what's written
in the man's medical report.
Disgraceful.
What was the commotion
with that lady all about?
- Madam, it was a land-related dispute.
- What?
The whole uproar was about the rent.
So, why was her blouse ripped?
Show me the formal complaint.
Madam, it was all an act.
A total farce.
Just some bickering
with the landlord over rent.
I didn't know we were
running a tribunal here!
Soni, do you ever follow what I say?
Chauhan, call that woman again.
I want a proper complaint filed.
Yes?
I see.
Okay, let's dispatch one constable.
Send someone levelheaded.
They're poor folks,
deal with them sensibly.
Okay.
Come on, blow into the tube!
Properly!
Mister, don't inhale!
You're supposed to blow into the tube!
Come on!
Make it quick! Get his reading,
and impound his vehicle.
Yes, madam.
Stand up straight, fatso.
Why is this car in the middle of the road?
Pull to the curb!
Come on, beat it!
Officer, take him into custody.
Madam, let me know
if you want a cup of tea.
There's hardly time to breathe,
let alone have tea.
Madam, can you please look into this?
What's the matter?
They're drinking in the car,
and refusing to step out.
This vehicle?
- How many are they?
- Two.
What's all the fuss about?
They are clearly intoxicated,
and not cooperating.
Oh boy!
Sir, roll down the window, please.
- Your ID, please.
- What?
Let's see some ID.
I am Lt. Commander Vikram Rathore.
Indian Navy.
Very good, sir.
Let's see your ID.
Madam, please teach this man some manners.
He's just doing his job, sir.
Your ID, please.
You know what?
We need women like you in the Navy.
The ID doesn't have my cell number.
Sir, your ID.
Show it, man!
What the fuck!
Had a little too much today, sir?
It's my birthday,
and tomorrow I'm getting married.
I see.
We're celebrating my bachelor party.
Sure, we'll celebrate it together.
Out of the car, please.
- Why, hop right in! Let's have a drink.
- Oh boy!
Let's get him tested.
Sir, please step out of the car.
Listen! Madam!
- Come on!
- Out of the car, please.
Listen, shithead! Stay back.
- Don't wag your finger at me.
- I'm not even talking to you.
I'm asking politely, please step outside...
Stop calling out to her.
You need to step out.
- Back off! Don't touch me, you pig!
- Stop wagging your finger.
Nope, I'm not talking to you.
Please, step out.
- Listen...
- You need to step out of the car, sir.
Listen, I've been polite so far,
but now I’m losing my patience.
- I'm telling you...
- Step outside, sir.
Out of the car, please.
- Sir, you're being very stubborn...
- No, you're not listening to me...
We're just doing our job.
Sir, this is wrong...
Sober now?
What do you think you're doing?
Arrogant swine!
Madam, calm down, please.
Hey, you! Put that phone away!
Please pull yourself together.
Madam, please.
Madam...
They are the Navy for heaven's sake.
People are recording us on their phones.
I'll gun her down!
Relax, madam.
You don't want a scandal here.
Hand me the bloody gun!
You're out of breath.
These damn stairs!
Why did you take the trouble?
Don't worry about me.
Cooking for friends is no trouble at all.
What is this? Did you not eat last night?
I did.
You barely had two pieces of bread.
You work so hard and barely eat anything.
This is convenient, isn't it?
Toss them in the machine and done.
And here I'm dealing with
backaches after handwashing a load.
You're welcome to wash them here.
I've never trusted a machine wash.
Nothing like scrubbing and
wringing with your own hands.
- Tell me something.
- Yes?
Your name has been
popping up a lot this morning.
My husband was
on a call with another officer
and your name was
mentioned quite a few times.
Did something happen?
It's nothing.
A man misbehaved with me, that's all.
May I suggest something?
Start applying <i>Sindoor</i> on your forehead.
When I attended sewing school
I remember having to pass
through this ghetto.
There were men who'd ogle me shamelessly.
One day I decided to apply <i>Sindoor...</i>
even though our religion
does not permit it.
But, guess what? No more stares!
Are you even listening?
Don't just nod! Take my advice...
and say goodbye to your worries.
Forever.
Tell me, would you like
to have some green tea?
You call that tea?
Thanks, but no thanks to your green tea.
There's neither flavor, nor color.
What's this?
Why not cover the windows completely?
- One can see everything from outside.
- Who cares?
Crazy girl! Have some sense.
Hey, Soni!
Listen.
Naveen is here.
I just saw him through the window.
Listen!
Look at me.
Let go of your bitterness.
Naveen is on his way up.
You two have to talk to each other.
Enough is enough.
- I'll see you later.
- Please stay for a little while.
No way. I can't stay.
Hello, Mrs. Huma.
- Where have you been?
- How are you?
It's been over two months
since I last saw you.
Just been busy with work.
Don't make excuses! She shouldn't
have to manage the house on her own.
Well, I'm here now.
Alright. Go see her now.
- You take care.
- Okay.
How have you been?
I stopped by last night,
but the door was locked.
I figured that you're probably
still doing night shifts.
Listen, I...
I brought you something.
No shoes in the kitchen!
Sorry, I just wanted to show you these.
- I want nothing from your shop.
- They're not from my shop!
I actually bought these for you.
It's so hot in here.
Is that your lunch on the table?
Better have it while it's hot.
I will.
Okay, I'll get you
some water with your food.
- Shoes!
- I'm sorry.
I totally forgot.
I'll take them off.
Don't bother.
Why?
Sorry, I forgot that you like
warm water with your food.
- Move your bag, please.
- Yes, of course.
Warm water is actually
very good for the body.
What were you doing in
the Civil Lines area yesterday?
- Yesterday?
- Yes, last night.
Saw you on your bike with a constable.
Oh, him!
He keeps calling me for advice.
Wants me to find a buyer for his flat.
I'm so sick of him.
Wait a minute.
You were at that checkpoint?
I see!
That's where the scuffle broke out.
- Why are you here, Naveen?
- I'm just here to talk.
Are you done yet?
Good morning, sir.
Can I click another, sir?
- Was that not good?
- It was okay. A backup, just in case?
I have work to get back to.
You have what you need.
Hi.
How's the new office?
So far so good.
- Two cups of tea, please.
- No, Sandeep. It's not necessary at all.
Try it. You'll like it.
Shall we sit over there?
Don't be so formal.
How was your meeting
with the Commissioner?
It went well.
He wants to invite us over for dinner.
I told him I'll have to ask my girl.
The new office is
looking great, by the way.
Yeah, the paint is
still fresh on the walls.
- The smell is annoying you, isn't it?
- Just a little.
So...
did he have anything to say
about the altercation at the checkpoint?
He is obviously upset.
There will be disciplinary action.
We'll have the official word
in a couple of hours.
I am also to blame.
I yelled at her in the team meeting.
I'll tell you what you're guilty of.
You're too softhearted.
You should've seen me
lash out at her in front of everyone.
You pamper your team too much.
That's why they behave this way.
Why in my 15 years of service,
has no one ever dared stir up trouble?
Sandeep, she's going through a
rough patch in her personal life as well.
So, that's another problem.
You start making these
personal connections with people.
Don't get swayed by emotions.
Anyway, don't waste
your time overthinking this.
You live and you learn.
By the way, those officers
were completely wasted.
Which gives the police
the right to flog them?
No, manhandling them
was definitely uncalled for.
But...
This had nothing to do
with the decoy operations, sir.
Understood, sir.
I'm sorry.
Yes, sir.
You have a good day.
Why sorry now?
You're having to answer for my mistake.
It's only appropriate,
since you report to me.
But it's not!
You shouldn't have to
answer for my actions.
If only things worked that way, Soni.
Will this impact our operation?
I called you here
to inform you about
your transfer to the Control Room.
You start tomorrow.
An inquiry has been ordered.
Madam, as long as you know
all the facts, I'm fine.
You know, when I was in eighth grade
I saw this young man getting
publicly flogged by three policemen.
The man was howling in pain.
But the three policemen
clubbed him until he passed out.
I later found out that he had been
stalking girls from my school.
But the howling still
made me sick to my stomach.
Daddy's turn.
Stop feeding her cherries.
- Now it's my turn.
- Watch out! Make way for Uncle.
Come over, Kalpana.
Happy birthday, dear.
God bless you, child.
Happy birthday, dear niece!
That's how it's done!
Nishu, that's enough!
Enough, Nishu!
I wonder where the maid has flown off to.
These people can be
such slackers sometimes.
You and Nishu are the perfect Capricorns!
Picking up after others.
I think... you turned 30 this year, right?
So...
Any decisions yet?
When are you planning your first one?
I haven't really given it a thought.
You should.
You should decide soon.
There's no point in delaying, you know.
You know...
I have a friend who's a gynecologist.
I'll give you her number.
She's quite helpful.
In case you need help.
You do want one, right?
Mom!
Mom, don't forget to
pack some cake for school.
- There's more than enough.
- Nice dress, niece!
Nishu!
You need to stop
calling Kalpana by her first name.
She's ""Aunt Kalpana.""
Be polite to your aunt.
I'm not calling her ""Aunt!""
Now please go change.
Or else you'll spoil your dress.
Aunt and niece always play
on the same team, Mother.
I don't mind the fun and games.
But I wonder
when is she going to
play with her own little one?
You must counsel her.
It'll happen when it's supposed to happen.
Don't worry!
I wish I could stop worrying.
Wise is the one who follows
the advice of the elderly.
Don't forget, the body clock is ticking.
One must act before time runs out.
Why are you all standing there?
Your tea is getting cold.
Yes, let's go.
You need to get some rest, Mom.
Yes, I'm going.
It's my duty to advise,
but to each his own.
My words fall on deaf ears.
That's enough.
- Are you going to pour the whole thing?
- Carry on, my man! Drink up.
Look who's here!
Welcome, Sir Kalpana.
We're in luck today!
To be able to steal some of your time.
I've got all the time
in the world for Nishu.
Where were you, Your Highness?
Clean up that mess,
and put the snacks in the fridge.
Excuse my cough.
So, what's the latest
on the queen of rage?
There's an ongoing investigation.
Let's see where it goes.
You see, these people
crave for the media's attention.
They think they will become
famous like that officer, Kiran Bedi.
The root of the matter is
these people engage in
domestic violence every day.
So, they are all naturally aggressive.
You've got a point.
Come, sit.
<i>You see, these special buses
will offer women a choice.</i>
<i>Our aim is to ensure that
they feel safe using the public transit.</i>
<i>Segregation is sometimes
necessary to ensure safety.</i>
<i>In case you've just joined us,
we have been in conversation</i>
<i>with our honorable guest,
Tourism Minister, Mr. Devi Dayal Doshi.</i>
<i>You're listening to</i> Voice of Delhi
<i>with me, Arun Roy.</i>
- Govind, make sure you have your dinner.
- Yessir.
Good evening, sir.
What's going on here?
A constable found this girl
crying in the City Mall's parking lot.
She won't tell us anything.
We've been questioning her for a while.
Step aside, please.
Please step out, both of you.
What's your name, sweetheart?
Don't be afraid. Tell me your name.
Where do you live?
Do you live in Delhi?
Then where?
Ranchi.
Do you know anyone here, in Delhi?
Who accompanied you to Delhi?
Don't be scared.
We'll soon take you to your parents.
Everything will be alright.
I'd like to have a word.
- Yes, madam?
- Can't you see the girl is scared?
On top of that,
three men were interrogating her.
- Madam...
- Did you call for a female officer?
I was about to make a phone call.
- I take it you understand the protocol?
- We just brought her in...
Spare me your explanations.
Call for a female officer immediately
to take her for a medical examination.
- Yes, madam.
- Hurry up.
What's the problem with these two?
- Madam, my husband committed no crime.
- You sit there.
That woman is lying.
- I swear by my daughter.
- Please be seated, madam!
- Please let him go. He is innocent.
- Wait!
Hold on a second!
What's this all about?
Madam, it's the lady versus landlord
case you asked us to investigate.
We've taken the landlord into custody.
She is his wife.
Madam, that day,
I was at home with my husband.
I told you to sit down!
- Ask our neighbors.
- Sit down.
That woman is lying.
- I have a house to run. Please!
- Please wait in the room.
Madam, please, believe me.
It's hard for us already.
Don't make a scene!
- Madam, I beg you. Please let him go.
- That's enough now.
You're at a police station! Behave!
Where's the complainant?
The lady refused to come
and submit a written complaint.
Has she given any statement at all?
No, I think, Soni madam was right.
This was indeed a land dispute,
which they have resolved between them.
So, this is none of her business anymore.
- Alright, let the man go.
- Yessir.
Can you...
get Soni reinstated?
You said you were
interviewing replacements.
None have been any good.
Things are looking grim.
Okay.
Let me send a few candidates your way.
But, you're going to dismiss them as well.
I can't believe you're
getting sentimental again.
Sandeep, I can't just go and hire anybody.
It's very hard to find
an officer like her.
- I know her heart is in the right place.
- It's her head that worries me.
I'll counsel her this time.
Kalpana, do not be friends
with your subordinates!
- It's not that easy to reinstate...
- At least try talking to the Commissioner.
You know that it wasn't all her fault.
The screen will flash on an incoming call.
Hit the space key to receive the call.
Most importantly, we must maintain a diary
with as many details as possible.
Especially the location.
Type in the notes
from the complaint in this diary.
The microphone is for
urgent announcements.
- You got it?
- Yes.
We have a call. Put on your headphones.
Delhi Police Control Room.
Good afternoon.
<i>Hello, we are experiencing
a foul smell in our neighborhood.</i>
Sir, your location, please.
<i>I'm calling from Sanjay Enclave.</i>
I'll need the exact address, please.
<i>It's building number 22, Sanjay Enclave.</i>
<i>It's a rotting carcass of some dog.
The stench is unbearable!</i>
Alright, sir. You'll receive a call
from your nearest police station.
But next time, it will be better
if you call the Municipal office.
<i>Municipal office?</i>
Yes, they'll take care of it.
<i>Nobody's going to take care of anything.
Can I talk to your supervisor?</i>
No, there's no supervisor here.
Tell me what your concerns are.
<i>Well, since you ask so nicely,
can I have your cellphone number?</i>
<i>Maybe we could talk offline.</i>
Okay, thanks for calling Delhi Police.
One or two such calls are a routine.
Soni madam!
Sweet buns?
- Two.
- How about three?
Okay.
Anything else?
- Two quarts of milk.
- Okay.
- Anything else?
- No, that's all.
- Add it to your account?
- Yes.
Add it in.
Alright, see you.
Where are you off to?
My elder son needs my help
as he is moving to a new place.
I wish he would get married,
and let me off the hook.
Look at you!
Wear some warm clothes! You'll catch cold.
They're rather warm.
Will you be able
to carry that all by yourself?
- I'll ask someone to help you.
- I'll manage.
Listen, did you get the gas cylinder yet?
No, I called the gas agency.
It should've arrived by now.
I will call them again today.
Who's going to cook for you?
You worry too much.
I can grab fast-food anytime I want.
Alright, whatever you say.
- You must be getting late.
- Yes, see you later.
<i>Good evening.</i>
<i>From the National Radio Service,
this is the evening news.</i>
<i>Prime Minister Modi has said

<i>Heavy rains and winds expected
to lash several states in the east.</i>
<i>Warnings of heavy flooding
and cyclone issued in parts of Odisha.</i>
<i>And, Syrian peace talks
proposed by Russia and Turkey falter</i>
<i>as rebel groups refuse to negotiate.</i>
<i>This is the National Radio Service.
Now the news in detail.</i>
<i>Prime Minister Modi has said that by 2030</i>
<i>India will be among the top three
countries in Science and Technology.</i>
<i>Mr. Modi inaugurated the 104th
Indian Science Congress today.</i>
<i>He emphasized that we must

<i>the power of ideas and innovation.</i>
<i>And that tomorrow's experts will come</i>
<i>from the investments we

ensure that violence does not take place</i>
<i>and that people not indulging
in this violence are protected.</i>
<i>The Syrian armed rebels have refused
all negotiations</i>
<i>in the peace talks
backed by Russia and Turkey.</i>
Yes, I'm home.
But about to leave for work.
I've been reinstated.
I've had my dinner already.
Naveen, I can't
discuss these things right now.
Yes, maybe tomorrow, but I don't know.
Why is the team still not here?
Madam, I just had a phone call
with Chauhan.
The team had to respond to an accident.
There's an unclaimed
dead body at the scene.
They won't be able to make it, then.
Let's call it off for today.
- Madam!
- Yes?
There's a notorious spot nearby.
We've recently had
some incidents reported there.
Let's go scout it.
My first case involving an unclaimed body
was that of an African male.
No identification at all.
In fact, two of my officers
got into an argument
whether to bury the body or cremate it.
Madam...
such cases take
a toll on one's sensibilities.
But shouldn't male bodies be easily...
Is this a whore-house?
What are you doing here?
We're just college students, sir.
College students, my ass!
You piece of shit!
You think I give a fuck?
Is this what they
teach in colleges these days?
Sir, please...
One would guess you belong
to a decent family, young lady.
Have you no shame?
- Let's inform your parents.
- Sir, please don't do that.
- We'll never come back here. I'm sorry!
- Enough of your ""sorry"" already!
Shove your ""sorry"" up your ass!
Keep your English to yourself, asshole.
Don't you understand what I said?
Come on, give me your parents' number.
- Or just pay us a fine.
- Right, sir. Sure.
Here, you can have this.
- How much is it?
- 200.
I'll beat the shit
out of you, you son of a bitch.
You think we're panhandling here?
It'll take us a second to charge
you for obscenity in a public place.
How about I throw your sorry ass in jail?
Where you can enjoy watching
your family beg for your release.
- I say we lock them up for a night, man.
- Sir, please don't!
Honey, do you have some on you?
Lover boy with an empty wallet,
asking his girl for money. Fucking loser!
Here, take more, sir.
- How much is this?
- We're giving you all we have, sir.
Nothing less than 3000! Understand?
This is all we have. Please take it.
What is this? I'm not your pimp!
Why, what's wrong? Take it!
Too much pride to accept bribe
from a lady?
No, madam, these two
were engaged in obscene acts.
- I see.
- Go home, kids.
- But, madam...
- Out, you two!
- Madam...
- Out, I said!
Madam, I'll walk from here.
I'll take your leave, madam.
Okay.
- Is the tea any good here?
- It's very good!
- Govind, get us two teas please.
- Yessir.
- Get one for yourself as well.
- Okay.
Madam...
I'll go tell the
vendor to make his special one.
He knows me well.
Okay.
- Hey! How are you doing?
- Good, madam.
Give me the special one with fennel.
Absolutely.
Great!
- You getting yours?
- Yes.
- Pack me a two-egg omelet as well.
- Sure!
Not bad.
Don't you like cooking?
I do.
Oh, actually, my gas cylinder ran out.
I've called the gas agency
a couple of times.
- I don't know what's taking so long.
- Govind can get you one.
- No, madam. I'll manage.
- It's nothing. Don't worry.
- Govind.
- Yes, madam?
- Please arrange a gas cylinder for her.
- Yessir!
- Madam, you didn't have to.
- It's okay.
I am still mad at
those constables at the park.
- You noted down their names, right?
- Yes.
Madam, the roasting you gave them!
I'm sure they'll never forget it.
I was thinking...
even if they weren't seeking a bribe...
we have a whole backlog of cases,
yet, this is how they use
their policing time!
I agree, madam.
By the way, what kind of advice
were you giving to that girl?
To dress up like a man?
The thing is...
I used to do it myself
when I was in college.
Going on a date becomes so much easier.
Don't start again.
Reminds me of my late grandmother...
who was diagnosed with
a fungal ear infection.
The surgery required
the hair around the ear...
to be shaved.
She refused because
her hair was sacred to her.
The surgery never happened.
The infection spread...
and it became impossible to save her.
Soni.
I wanted to tell you something.
I am opening up a pharmacy shop.
- Your shop folded already?
- The bloody supplier ran away.
This doctor I know has told me
that there's a 300% profit margin.
Once I get the license,
it will be a gold mine.
Isn't it always?
It's been the same story
for the past five years.
Make it quick!
They're running late again.
What happened?
They're winding up some paperwork.
Maybe another 20 minutes.
I see.
You eat too much junk food.
- I barely had time to cook today.
- So, has your new gas cylinder arrived?
I'll go get one tomorrow.
- Govind!
- Yes, madam?
Where is her gas cylinder?
Madam... it should be on its way.
The order's been placed.
I gave you a simple task.
Spare me your lame excuses.
I'll manage, madam.
- No later than tomorrow!
- Yessir.
It's as if orders aren't orders,
until I raise my voice.
- Did you say 20 minutes?
- Yes.
- Wanna get some tea in the meantime?
- Sure.
Welcome.
Madam, you really shouldn't
worry about me.
This place looks pricey.
I'm not worrying at all.
What would you like to eat?
Just a cup of tea for me.
You go ahead.
How about a <i>Dosa?</i>
Sure.
Two <i>Dosas</i> and two cups of tea.
For what?
I know you fought for me.
I did what I could.
Are things any better at home?
I don't know.
Some days... I feel things are improving.
On other days, they seem worse.
They surely will never be the same.
Once you truly know someone...
is it easier to accept them?
- I'll quickly go use the washroom.
- Okay.
That way.
- Where's the washroom?
- Pardon?
- Which way is the washroom?
- Straight ahead, behind that wall.
Thanks.
Hey there!
- What's your name?
- Veronica.
Veronica!
That's a beautiful name.
So, how old are you now?
- What grade are you in?
- Public School.
Do you have any siblings, Veronica?
Sis, I wanna go pee!
Sorry, she's been
holding it in for a while.
- Have you been waiting long?
- Yes, but it's locked from the inside.
Someone's probably in there.
Who is it?
Just tell the motherfucker to fuck off.
Bloody hell!
Hello, madam!
How can we help?
Get out of the ladies' room.
- Gentlemen!
- Yeah?
Check out that voice!
She's probably an opera singer.
Her voice is beautiful, no doubt.
Madam, why don't you come join us?
That will give us a chance to see
other beautiful things about you.
Don't mind these rude rascals.
Probably best to keep the
kids away from them.
Just hold it in for another 30 minutes.
We'll be done by then.
Also...
tell the manager, that J.B. can't
share the bathroom with anyone.
Bitch.
I got this.
The lady is in the mood.
She's feisty!
- All three of you out, right now!
- Or else?
I could swear,
I've seen her somewhere, man!
You jerked off to her last night!
Your favorite website!
I'd love to see you perform live.
- Filthy pig!
- Fucking bitch!
Yes, sir.
I just had a word with your assistant.
Yessir.
I'm surely going to look into it, sir.
Yessir.
Did someone just drop by?
Sandeep?
What's going on?
You need to tell me...
what's going on.
Wasn't last night's operation
at the metro station?
Yes.
However, your team got busy
turning a restaurant upside down
with Badwal's son.
Badwal, who?
An old friend of Tourism Minister Doshi...
as well as his party's election fund.
I've repeatedly warned you. Haven't I?
Now you see the outcome.
Doshi sent his assistant
to humiliate me in my own house.
His son was in possession of cocaine.
Good luck proving this possession!
We can still nab him
for consumption of drugs.
And then what?
A fine of twenty thousand?
Before any of that happens, you'll be
dragged into yet another inquiry.
For someone who's been
doing this for four years...
you're incredibly naive!
Are you satisfied now?
Or still hungry for more?
- Now you're being really rude.
- What do you expect?
Are you going to pin all the blame on me?
No.
I'm the one at fault...
for listening to you.
I'm tired of repeating myself,
that you've got to be authoritative!
Why be a cop if
you're never going to act like one?
<i>Each bus will have the
presence of a woman security guard</i>
<i>as well as a female fare collector.</i>
<i>The buses will have a CCTV camera</i>
<i>and a host of other safety measures.</i>
Good evening, madam!
Please come in.
Here.
You didn't have to do this, madam.
It's okay. It's just food.
How's your wrist?
Getting better.
I'll get you some water.
No, I'm fine. You should eat.
I'll get some plates then.
Did that man hit you first?
Soni, I'm asking you a question.
Are you listening to me?
The man occupies the ladies room,
calls me a whore,
snorts drugs publicly,
and I'm the one who has to explain myself?
I was also there.
Why didn't you come back and inform me?
We could have easily nabbed him.
He got nabbed anyway.
We're not pressing charges.
Don't argue with me
when you don't know the facts!
You can't let him off.
Do you realize what the
consequences might be?
What's the worse than can happen?
Perhaps another inquiry?
No more decoy operations?
Haven't we seen their cowardly policies?
Special taxis, segregated buses...
Fenced ghettos will come...
Throw another one!
Too late now. Go!
Bastards!
You bastards!
Go, go!
Hey, stop!
Son of a bitch!
You cowards!
Motherfuckers!
I'll hunt down these motherfuckers!
- Don't bother. I can manage.
- Manage?
That's what you've been saying all along.
Is this what you call managing?
We wouldn't have this mess,
had I been living here!
Those sons of bitches
would have been dead right now!
- You don't have to raise your voice.
- Soni, listen to me!
Listen to what? Tell me!
Do you ever listen to yourself?
Always building castles in the air.
At least I live on my own terms.
I don't bob my head
and say ""yessir"" all the time.
Of course, why would you?
When have you ever
taken any responsibility?
You never wanted anything
that would tie you down, right?
Soni...
I know that you still haven't forgiven me.
You have every right to punish me.
I will accept any punishment.
I would've done it long ago,
had I thought it would do any good.
At least give me a chance to make amends.
I know I hurt you. I admit it.
But, at the time,
I didn't know what else to do.
I felt ignored to the extent
that I thought
you didn't need me in this house.
And what's different now?
Look...
I need you, Soni.
And as we stand here in this mess...
I honestly feel that you need me as well.
You really have the nerve
to suggest that, Naveen?
It was because of you
that I suffered... so much.
I trusted you blindly.
Followed you wherever you wanted to go,
with my eyes closed.
And when I opened them...
you weren't there.
There wasn't even a shadow of you.
Soni, after the termination,
my life was shattered as much as yours.
And did you help me pick up the pieces?
The decision was yours.
Yes, it was.
The decision was mine.
But you always wished
I'd do it, didn't you?
You weren't even around to stop me.
We could try again.
Is this all a joke to you?
I was doing it with my girl in my car
and this fucking cop banged on my window!
He said, ""Your car's shaking
like a washing machine!""
- Hey, you!
- Cut it out, man!
Dude, next time, get a fucking hotel room.
Only morons like you would go to a hotel.
Hotels are nothing but traps!
They'll call the cops on you
and those bastards won't let you off
without a fat bribe. And...
Dude, hotels have escorts
going in and out all the time.
It's only dimwits like you who get caught.
It's not funny, man.
The brothels are
running right under their noses.
Well, you can't do shit about it.
Light me a cigarette, man.
We'll be there in an hour.
See you, then.
Offerings for the fire.
Good evening! Warm greetings!
- Happy <i>Lohri</i> to all!
- Warm greetings to you too, dear!
- Haven't seen you in a while!
- Yes, we've been blessed with a grandson!
- Wow! Congratulations!
- Thank you.
- Celebrating the little one's first <i>Lohri?</i>
- Yes, absolutely!
Happy <i>Lohri!</i>
Why are all the lights off?
Sleeping?
What's with all this mess?
Your mom said you locked yourself in
after you came back from school.
Stressed about grades?
What's going on?
Come on, you can tell me.
Nishu.
Because of my period...
I was making frequent
trips to the washroom, at school.
When...
When I returned to
the classroom after my lunch break,
there was a sanitary pad taped to my desk,
along with a note
that said ""For those days.""
Do you know who did it?
No.
Did you report this to your teacher?
Report whom?
Everyone was laughing at me.
Including my own friends.
Felt like shooting them all.
Look at me, sweetie.
Report this to your teacher.
Find out who did it.
And you must confront them.
But, remember one thing...
they will always
try to get the better of you.
Because they know...
that you're stronger than them.
They fear you.
Some water, madam?
- I'll make some tea.
- Please don't trouble yourself!
- It'll only take a minute!
- Please! I'd rather sit and talk.
I brought this for you.
<i>The Revenue Stamp.</i>
I've read a few
short stories by Amrita Pritam.
Good. This is her memoir.
You're giving me your own copy?
Yes, I want you to have it.
I'm sure you'll like it.
If not all...
it should answer a few of your questions.
What is a revenue stamp?
It's a small excise stamp for
tax collection on tobacco and liquor.
An esteemed writer
once told Amrita Pritam...
that her life was so inconsequential...
that all of it could fit
on the back of a revenue stamp.
I can't have you resign, Soni.
If only I was making
the slightest difference.
I have a 13-year-old niece...
who's very fond of me.
She said an appalling thing today.
She said that she wanted to shoot
all her classmates.
Some of them played a gross prank on her.
In a situation such as this...
did my words make any difference?
Who knows?
All I know is...
I comforted her.
- Did you get his statement?
- He's being difficult.
- Bring him in.
- Yessir.
- Let go of me, asshole!
- Keep walking!
- Keep your hands off me!
- Just get in!
- I want my phone!
- I'm not your butler, shithead.
I won't give any statement!
- I want my phone back!
- Shut up!
You can't intimidate me.
I'm not giving any statement!
Stop your babble!
Madam, I want a word
with the Commissioner.
I want the Commissioner!
- Have the charges been drafted yet?
- Yessir. ""Attempt to Kidnap.""
- Add ""Criminal Trespassing"" as well.
- Yessir.
Is this a joke?
Listen to me very carefully!
You know who my father is. Very well!
You can't confiscate my phone like this!
I need to call my father right now.
We've sealed your phone.
It's part of the evidence now.
I don't care!
- Get my father on the line...
- Quiet!
Send his father
a copy of the formal report.
- Yessir.
- Formal report?
Tell him he needs to come in.
You owe me an explanation!
I've been made to sit outside for hours,
without even a glass of water.
I know my rights!
You should have thought about them
when you occupied the ladies room.
I'm going to file a complaint. You'll see.
Also add ""Illicit Trafficking of Drugs,""
- and ""Assaulting an Officer on Duty.""
- Yessir.
Hang on a minute.
Show me the evidence!
You'll see the evidence in court.
- How long a detention did we file for?
- Seven days.
- Make it 14, and...
- Madam, listen to me.
Do not interrupt me!
Make sure his call-record is attached.
- Madam, just hear me out...
- Let's go, boy!
Hang on, I'm talking to her.
Keep your hands off me!
Delhi Police Control Room.
Good evening.",39929
